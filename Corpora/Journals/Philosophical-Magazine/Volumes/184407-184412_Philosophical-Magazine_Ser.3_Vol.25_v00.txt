these things held   for a compound substance the iodide of
silver (Phil. Mag.  Sept. 1841).
    For reasons which will be obvious as the description pro
ceeds, I shall speak of chlorine which has been exposed to the
beams of the sun, as tithomized chlorine.
                           I.    Description   of the     eageriment.
     In two similar white glass tubes place equal volumes of
  chlorine, which has been made from peroxide of manganese
  and muriatic acid by lamplight, and carefully screened from
  access of daylight.    Expose one of the tubes to the full sun
 beams for some    minutes,  or if the light be feeble, for a quarter
 of an hour: the chlorine which is in it becomes tithonized.
  Keep the other tube during this time carefully in a dark place;
                       }.
 and now, by lamplight, add to both equal volumes of hydro
 gen gas.           processes are best carried on in a small por
 celain or earthenware trough, filled with a saturated solution
 of common salt, which dissolves chlorine slowly; and to avoid
 explosions operate on limited quantities of the gases.        Tubes
 that are eight inches long and half an inch in diameter will
 answer very well. The two tubes now contain the same
 gaseous mixture, and only differ in the circumstance that one
 is tithonized and the other not. Place them therefore side by
 side before a window, through which the entrance of daylight
 can be regulated by opening the shutter; and now, if this part
 of the process is conducted properly, it will be seen that the
 tithonized chlorine commences to unite with the hydrogen,
 and the salt water rises in that tube.        But the untithonized
 chlorine shows no disposition to unite with          hydrogen, andits
 the liquid       tube remains motionless for long time.
                   in   its                                       a                     Fi
nally,       becomes slowly tithonized
             as   it                          the action    the day
                                                            by            of
                                on
light impinging           union it,  last takesatplace.   From this,
therefore, we perceive that chlorine which has been exposed
to   the sun will unite promptly and energetically with hydro
gen; but chlorine that has been made and kept               the dark     in
 shows       no
            such property.
    As doubt not this remarkable experiment will

             The change in the chlorine is not transient.
   Now it might be supposed that this apparent exaltation of
the electro-negative properties of the chlorine is only a trans

to   its   original untithonized condition.

   Let      us    proceed               inquiry                                                        of

rests     the circumstance
           in                      the absorption of     rays which cor              of

     Ina tube, over salt water, mix together equal volumes                                                       of
untithonized chlorine and hydrogen gas.                 Expose          the                      it    to
daylight, marking the time            which the   exposure
                                                       at     commences.

   A mixture of chlorine and hydrogen does not, therefore,
instantly give rise to the production of muriatic acid on ex
posure to the light, but as a preliminary condition a certain
definite amount of absorption must take place.
   Now if this were a mere molecular disturbance, such as
might be brought about by the action of heat, we should ex
pect to find it transient and speedily passing away. . . Such,
however, is far from being the case. As with simple chlorine,
so with this mixture, after it has been tithonized it loses its
quality very slowly.     I have observed that after a week or
 more has elapsed since it was first exposed to the light, it
 commences to contract when placed in a feeble gleam.
               IV.
               Rays are absorbed in producing this change.
      Ihave thus far assumed that the rays which bring about
these changes are absorbed; the following is the proof which
I  have to offer:—
    Over a tube half an inch in diameter and six inches long,
closed at            its
                 upper extremity and open                  lower, invert
                                                                       at    its                   a
jar       the same length and one inch and
          of                                            half     diameter.
                                                                        a               in
 Fill the tube and the jar the salt water trough, about two
                                                at
 thirds full, with the same mixture             chlorine and hydrogen.

                                to  except  after having   passed   through
 the gaseous mixture           the jar. After
                                       in           certain space  a    time                  of

                  of              the jar commences

in   the tube will remain much longer wholly stationary.

   There is a great advantage which experiments conducted
in this way possess over those which depend for their indica
tion on the stains impressed on Daguerreotype plates or sen
sitive papers. In those cases we obtain merely a comparative
contrast for different regions of the spectrum; in this we have
absolute measures determined by a definite chemical effect
and the rise of a liquid in a graduated tube; and from this
we gain juster views of the true constitution of the spectrum.
On studying the numbers in the foregoing table, or better
still, if we project them, it will appear what an enormous dif
ference there is in the chemical force of the different rays.
In the experiment from which I have deduced this table, it
appears that the force of the indigo ray exceeds that of the
orange in a greater ratio than 66 to 1; and from the circum
stances under which the experiment is made, this difference
must be greatly underrated. There is always diffused light
in the room coming from the intromitted beam, and this ac
celerates the rise in the less refrangible tubes; then again, it
is impossible that the tube which gives the greatest elevation
shall coincide mathematically with the maximum point and
express the maximum effect.
    From some estimates       I
                              have made, I am led to believe that
in  point  of chemical  force, for this mixture of chlorine and
 hydrogen, the indigo ray exceeds the red in a higher ratio
 than 500 to 1.
     VI. The action is positive from end to end of the spectrum.
    M. Becquerel found, that for a Daguerreotype plate the
red, the orange, and the yellow rays possess the quality of
continuing the action begun by the more refrangible colours;
he therefore names these “rayons continuateurs.”          For the
same compound I found that those rays, acting horizontally
with the diffused daylight, exerted a negative agency. It is
therefore desirable to understand whether, with respect to the
gases now under consideration, the lesser refrangible rays
exert anything in the way of an action of depression or hin
drance to union. By direct experiment I found that this was
not the case, the action being positive from end to end of the
spectrum. . This can be shown by removing the tubes, after
 they have been in the spectrum for an hour or two, into the
 gleams of daylight.    One by one they exhibit after a time a
 rise, the order being the green first, then the yellow and the
 orange, and at last the red. And if at the same time a tube
 which has been kept in the dark be exposed along with them,
 they will  allrise before    it,
                               showing that tithonization had set
    and been
    in        going on   inthem all; thatit  had been more active

in the green than in the yellow, in the yellow than in the
orange, in the orange than in the red; and, had the expo
sure to the spectrum been long enough, the liquid in every
one   of the      tubes would have risen.
 VII.       The indigo ray forms the muriatic acid as well as          pro
                  duces the preliminary tithonization.
   It only now remains to inquire, whether the rays which
cause the production of the muriatic acid are those which
effect the tithonization of the chlorine; in other words, whether
the first stage of the process is brought about by the same
agent which carries on the second.       The experiment which                I
have just described shows that tithonization is most actively
produced by the indigo ray, and it is easy to show that it is
the same ray which carries on the second part of the process;
for, if before placing the tubes in the prismatic spectrum we
tithonize them in the daylight, so that the liquid has just com
menced to rise in each, and then expose them to the spectrum,
it will be found that the tube in the indigo rises most rapidly,
and the others in the order stated before. Therefore we per
ceive that the same ray commences, carries on, and completes
the process.
   Few substances can exceed in sensitiveness to light a mix
ture of chlorine and hydrogen previously tithonized. Brought
into the obscure daylight of a gloomy chamber, it is remark
able how promptly the level of the liquid in the tube rises;
how, when the shutters are successively thrown open, the ac
tion becomes more and more energetic; and how, in an                      in
stant, it stops when the instrument is shaded by a screen.
  I  have not recorded in this communication a multitude of
experiments of detail which go to support the conclusions
here drawn, and which will be published at a proper time. It
has been my object on this occasion to call attention to the
fact, that chlorine, an elementary body, undergoes a change
after exposure to the light; a change which appears to pro
duce an exaltation of     electro-negative properties,
                            its                               as
                                                            shown is
by    its
        power          of
                    uniting more energetically with hydrogen.
This change must not         confounded with those transient ele
            activity due      to be
vations      of              increased temperature, inasmuch               as
this  ismore permanent                  its
                                   character.

space       of
          the spectrum.    That the  phaenomenon     dueis    true a to
absorption      fully shown
                  is              the circumstance, that

chlorine and hydrogen which has been prepared in the dark.
A certain space of time elapses before any formation of mu
riatic acid occurs, during which the absorption in question is
going on; and when that is completed, and the mixture is                                            ti
thonized, union of the gases begins and muriatic acid forms.
From end to end of the spectrum the action is positive, and
differs only in intensity; but this difference in intensity opens
before us new views of the constitution and character of the
solar beam.

the rays produce a change.          In his chapter on phosphorus,

feathery crystals formed, the tint of which bore a close resem
blance to that of the red prussiate of potash.
    Since the invention of the tithonometer, I have been able
to observe more closely the habitudes of chlorine. In the de
scription given of that instrument in the December number
 (1843) of this Journal, it is recommended to cast aside the
first observation, because it never gives an accurate estimate
of the true effect. When a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen
is exposed, muriatic acid does not immediately form; but a
preliminary tithonization is necessary, and then at the end of
a certain period contraction begins to take place.
    A tithonometer exposed to the daylight is much too pow
erfully affected to allow of the successive stages of change to
be distinctly made out; the preliminary tithonization is accom
plished so rapidly, that the indications of it are merged and
lost in the contraction which instantly follows. . It is necessary
therefore that we should operate with a small lamp-flame.
    To such a flame exposed a mixture of chlorine and hy
                             I
drogen, and marked the number of seconds which elapsed
before contraction, arising from the production of muriatic
acid, took place. The first indications of movement occurred
at the close of 600 seconds.
The index      then moved through the first degree in 480 seconds

and continued to move with regularity at the same rate.
    These observations, therefore, prove that a very large
amount of radiant matter is absorbed before chemical combi
nation takes place; and that in the case of chlorine and hy
drogen the total action is divisible into two periods; the first
 during which a simple absorption is taking place without a
 chemical effect, the second during which absorption is attended
 with the production of muriatic acid.

    The facts which am endeavouring to set forth prominently
 in this communication are, 1st, the preliminary tithonization
just discussed; and 2nd, the persistent character of the change
 impressed upon chlorine when it has been exposed to the sun,
 an effect wholly unlike a calorific effect, which would soon
disappear.

 equally distinct upon the second point, that the preliminary

        III.      Comparative Analysis of Recent and Fossil Bones.
                       By J. MIDDLEToN, Esq., F.G.S.
                           To Richard Phillips, Esq.
             DEAR SIR,
          lately devoted some time and attention to the
HAVING
   analyses of bones, both recent and fossil, I trust some
of the results at which     I have arrived may not be unacceptable
to the readers of the     Philosophical   Magazine.       I took up the
subject with the view of ascertaining, if possible, the law by
which fluoride of calcium becomes augmented or developed
in fossil bones, as, should this be established, an important
step would,                I
                  conceived, be thereby made towards the ascer
tainment of    geological   time.
    That fossil bones contain fluoride of calcium in greater
  uantity than recent ones is a fact which has long been known,
though heretofore not adequately explained. One theory pro
posed to account for it on the hypothesis that the source of
fluorine in animals is their food, and that that in former times
must have contained a greater quantity of the substance than
it now does, and thus the bones of animals then living came to
possess it in a higher proportion.          To this theory, however,
I  felt unable to consent, as, in order to entitle it to credence,
 its supporters should,       my opinion,   in  prepared             be
                                                               show that
                   of        capable from                     occupyingits            of to

    living bones, without detriment                             strength;

                         if    a            fluoride      calcium were          of

                  in                   of

   I  no longer entertained a doubt as to the source of fluorine
in recent bones and of its accumulation in fossil ones.                 The
fact which my investigations also disclosed to me, viz. that
fluorine is not confined to the bones of recent Mammalia, but
exists also in those of birds and reptiles, as also in the shells of
Mollusca, was also thus accounted for.               Indeed the last fact is
alone enough to prove that the source of fluorine must be as
generally diffused as water is; while the reception of that sub
stance by the organism being secured and placed beyond the
dominion of tastes or caprice, seems to elevate in importance
the function which it has to fulfil.
   I  shall now proceed to detail a few of the analyses made
in  prosecution   of the object with which my investigations were
begun. My inferences as to the geological bearing of the re
sults have already been submitted to the Geological Society.

meter is of the circular form, as might be easily shown. This
 appears to be the simplest shape to which the quadrature
of the spherical ellipse can be reduced, the parameter and
 modulus being the eccentricities of the plane and spherical
ellipse respectively.

or taking the whole surface S of the spherical conic, and the
whole circumference X of the supplemental conic, introducing
c the radius     of the    sphere, we obtain the remarkable theorem
                            S +   c>   =  2 cºw.      . . . . . . (27.)
 Now c 2' is twice the lateral surface of the supplemental cone,                  ;
measured in one direction only from the centre, and may be
put equal to 2 L', hence we deduce that
    XII.      The spherical base of any cone, together with twice the
lateral surface of the supplemental cone, is equal to the surface
of the    hemisphere.
    XIII.      Let S denote the spherical base of the supplemental
cone, and       L  the lateral surface of the given cone contained
within the      sphere,   then from the preceding equations we have

     XIV. If any two concentric          cones, supplemental to each other,
 be cut    by  a concentric    sphere,  the sum of their spherical bases,
 together with twice their lateral surfaces, is equal to the surface
 of the sphere.
     And the difference of their bases is equal to twice the differ
 ence   of their lateral     surfaces.   Hence also this other theorem:
    * The discovery of this remarkable relation between the length and area
 of a spherical ellipse is due to Professor MacCullagh, to whom mathema

therefore the two elliptic arcs constitute the quadrant; this is
the well-known theorem of Fagnani.

digression from the main subject of this paper, that if a series
of concentric ellipses be described having coincident axes, and
the sum of their semiaxes constant equal to L suppose, the locus
of their points of linear section will be a hypocycloid, concentric
with the ellipses; the radius of whose generating circle = L,
and the radius of whose rolling circle is = # L; and also that
 the difference between the elliptic arcs is to the difference be
tween the corresponding hypocycloidal arcs in the constant
ratio of 2:3.

a   formula for the rectification of curves on the surface of a
sphere analogous to (31.).
   As in none of the successive steps of the preceding demon
stration is any reference made to the peculiar properties of
curves or cones of the second degree, it is clear that the pre
ceding formula will hold for the rectification of any curve upon
the surface of a sphere, the intersection of this surface with a
concentric cone of any order, and as a curve traced liberd
manu on the surface of a sphere may be constituted the base
of a cone whose vertex shall be at the centre of the sphere, it
is plain that the above formula may be applied to the recti
fication of any curve upon the surface of a sphere.
   Hence as an arc of any plane curve may be expressed by
means of a definite integral and a finite right line, so may the
arc of any curve described on the surface of a sphere be ex
hibited by means of a definite integral and an arc of a circle.

     XXXI.      Having already exceeded the conventional limits
  of a mathematical paper in this Journal, it may suffice to give
  the enunciations of a few theorems on the spherical ellipse
  analogous to those which have been already established on
  the plane ellipse, postponing their discussion to a future oc
  CaSiOn.
     Through the extremities of the arcs of the spherical ellipse
 two spherical hyperbolas may be drawn having the same focus
 as the spherical ellipse; calling the axes of the one nearer to
 the minor axe 2A and 2 B, the axes of the other passing
 through the extremity of the arc measured from the major axe
 2 A and 2 B, we may with little difficulty establish the <U+017F>ol
 lowing relations:–

 V.          On Parietin, a yellow colouring matter, and on the Inorganic
            Constituents of Lichens.   By Robert D. Thomson, M.D.,
            Lecturer on Practical Chemistry in the University of Glas
            gowº.
 THE   objects of the present paper are, 1st, to endeavour
   to show that, contrary to the generally received opinion,
  the class of plants termed Lichens require inorganic matter
 as part of their food, which they must derive from the locali
 ties upon which they are fixed; and, 2nd, to describe the
 yellow colouring matter obtained from the yellow wall lichen,
 and to detail       properties, composition, and application
                                  its                                                                      as

 test for alkalies.
    Although chemists are acquainted with several yellow co
 louring matters, few                   of
                              them have been separated                 pure                 in    a
 state and   analysed.    This    may       satisfactorily  explained

 plant from which they are extracted. The obstacle lies                 the
 facility with which they unite with oxygen, and                their con            in
 sequent conversion into         body        a          of

 uncrystallized structure. The yellow colouring matters which
 have hitherto been analysed are derived from various parts                                                 of
 phenogamous plants, principally the roots and flowers. The
 subject     the present paper
                    of                obtained fromis      different class       a

species   of plants, only three of which, however, can be reck
oned true lichens, the remainder being Hepaticae and Algae,
closely allied tribes. In Hooker's British Flora, published in
1833, there are described 420 species, included under 39
genera of lichens, as inhabiting the three kingdoms. It is well
known that many of these are capable of affording powerful
colouring matters.
   The lichen from which the colouring matter to be described,
which I propose to term Parietin, is derived, is of very fre
quent occurrence on walls and trees. It is the Parmelia pa
rietina (yellow wall Parmelia), described
the frond   “orbicular, bright yellow;
                                              Hooker as having
                                        the lobes marginal, ra   º
diating, appressed, rounded, crenate and crisped, granulated
in the centre; beneath paler and fibrillose, the repositories
being deep orange, concave, with an entire border.”         The
bright yellow colour of the lichen is a sufficient indication of
the presence of a colouring matter, but the real intensity of
the colour could scarcely be anticipated merely by an inspec
tion of the plant.

  It is stated by Sir William Hooker, that among the lichens
“imperfect roots are sometimes formed, but more for the pur
pose of fixing the plant to

   Where lichens can be procured in abundance, a circum
stance which may occur frequently in reference to the rein
deer lichen, so frequent on our moors, they may be used
with great advantage as manures, since they contain a larger
amount of inorganic matter than any other plants, with the
exception of the sea-weeds. The following Table contains my
analyses of three kinds of wood, Lima, Sapan and logwood,
from which it will be observed that the quantity of salts is
much inferior to that contained in many of the lichens:–

  In this   table the composition of the yellow Parmelia has
been  adopted,   while in the alge the result of the analysis of a
  igantic sea-weed from Cape Horn, supplied me by Dr. Joseph
   ooker, has been introduced. 490 grains of this plant yielded
by incineration 116-7 of ashes, equivalent to 23.8 per cent.
    The introduction of inorganic matter into the substance of
trees and lichens can only be effected by the inferior extre
mity and surface of those portions which are in contact with
the source of this peculiar pabulum of vegetable life, while it
would appear that the connexion which we always find to sub
sist between sea-weeds and some fixed rocky position, even in
#.
the case of these immense inhabitants of the southern seas, ac
cording to some physiologists, only serves the purpose of re
               stationary in one locality, their food being derived
from the fluid in which they are immersed. But whether this
be true or not, it is certain that the waters of the ocean are
capable of affording       all
                           the inorganic constituents with which

44         Dr. R. D. Thomson         on   Parietin and on the
these plants are supplied.      Trees and lichens have no such
atmosphere, rich in salt, from which they can derive their
nourishment.     They must be indebted for the inorganic food
which they contain to the soil upon which they grow; thence,
                           i.
since lichens do certainly contain inorganic matter of various
kinds, as appears from       facts detailed in this paper, the           in
evitable conclusion is forced upon us, that these species of
plants are not only nourished by the atmosphere to which bo
tanists have hitherto appeared to restrict their sources of food,
but that they are also capable of extracting inorganic matter

plants is so extensively distributed.
                     Preparation of Parietin.
   When the yellow Parmelia is digested in cold alcohol, of
spec. grav. '840, a yellow fluid is produced,         from
 the solution of the yellow colouring matter of the lichen.
 When gently boiled the liquid becomes deeper coloured, and
 when a sufficient quantity of alcohol is employed and the
liquor is allowed to evaporate spontaneously,             i. colouring
matter is   deposited   on the sides of the vessel in the form of
fine yellow needles, sometimes a quarter of an inch in length.
The specimens of lichen from which crystals of this descrip
 tion were extracted, were derived from a dry wall, and at a             di
 stance from the neighbourhood of the sea.
    In order to procure the colouring matter of the yellow Par
 melia, it is proper to dry the lichen at a moderate tempera
ture. This observation is particularly applicable to sea spe
cimens, which are much more succulent than those derived
from inland localities.      By this precaution the alcohol will
more   completely   extract the colouring matter, without violent
or long-continued boiling.       We should probably succeed in
obtaining the purest product by removing as much as possible
of the water from the lichen, by drying in a stove and then
digesting in cold alcohol.      The quantity of lichen, however,
at  my  disposal  has not hitherto been sufficient to enable me to
accomplish the extraction in this manner.          It has been stated
that the colouring matter may be obtained in the form of
needles, but generally it falls in the shape of brilliant yellow
scales as the alcoholic solution cools. The mode in which it
                            is,
may be readily procured    to    boil the lichen gently with alcohol
for few minutes, and then
     a                          tofilter and add fresh alcohol until
the colouring matter appears         to   be
                                           entirely taken up. The
solution has   scarcely  passed through    the filter before    begins

principle so much in vogue at present, “similia similibus cu
rantur.” Hoffmann affirms that he never could obtain a yellow
colour from this lichen, but that with wine-vinegar he obtained
an olive-green or fawn colour, and with true wine-vinegar
(aceto vini vero) and copperas a flesh or apricot shade. Of these
colours he has appended to his essay specimens, together with
forty-nine others obtained from various species of lichens. Dr.
John P. Westring, of Nordkoping in Sweden, who prose
cuted an extensive inquiry into the colouring matters of lichens,
describes the Lichen parietinus (Wagglaf) as affording with
wool, by infusion for fourteen days and then boiling for half
an hour, a fawn colour; by longer boiling a yellow was pro
duced, and this mixture became, by simple infusion and ex
traction, similar to the red wool of Florence.        With common
salt and nitre, boiled for an hour, a beautiful straw colour was
elicited. Upon silk it gave similar colours, differing in their
shade from red to yellow, according to the methods employed
in dyeing the goods”.
    Subsequently to these observations, which are perhaps in
teresting in an oeconomical point of view, the yellow Parmelia
was recommended         by Dr. Sande, probably misled by the
colour, as a substitute for Peruvian bark, during the last French
war.      It has also been chemically examined by Herberger,
but not apparently with the same results afforded by Scotch
specimens, as he found no inorganic constituents, which amount
to from 6 to 7 per cent. according to my trials, and obtained
a much larger quantity of colouring matter than existed in any
plants examined by me. He also found a red colouring matter
which did not appear in the process of extraction as followed
by me, and which may, therefore, be a product of the oxida
tion of parietin.
    More lately still Dr. Gunprecht extracted yellow            from         oil
the lichen, but   in such minute quantity       not   as           be

just before  it  caught fire, giving rise    abundant yellow fumes.

 stalline  grains, when the    alcohol,   with which the   colouring                   |
matter was extracted, was allowed          evaporate spontaneously.

                    brief history of photography have these unpleasant occurrences
                    happened. Egerton published a treatise" in which the names
                    of Sir J. Herschel and Mr. Hunt were scarcely to be seen.
                       The air of vanity and the curious errors which pervade this

a minute to a day or more, according to the quantity of the
gases and the freedom of communication.”
   Dr. Dalton proceeds further to discuss the rationale of the
action, and the result was (to use his own words), “In the
autumn of 1801 I hit upon an idea which seemed to be ex
actly calculated to explain the phaenomena of vapour; it gave
rise to a great variety of experiments, upon which a series of
essays were founded, which were read before the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Manchester, and published in the
fifth volume of their Memoirs, 1802.
    “The distinguishing feature of the new theory was, that the
particles of one gas are not elastic or repulsive in regard to
the particles of another gas, but only to the particles of their
own kind.”
   The immediate result of the publication of this view of the
mutual relations of mixed elastic fluids was, a discussion be
tween Dr. Dalton, Mr. Murray, Mr. Gough, &c., which ter
minated in leaving the subject of “diffusion ” in a state of in
decision.
   Mr. Graham took up the subject experimentally in 1825,
and ascertained the arithmetical law of the rate of diffusion,
which he thus expresses:—“The mathematical relation which
subsists between the diffusion, volume and the density of a gas
is expressed thus:
                     -   -   -
                    diffusion volume =

where d represents the specific gravity of the gas.”—Elements
of Chemistry, p. 72.*
  Mr. Graham's experiments were performed with great care,
and are of undoubted accuracy.  In 1834, through the me
dium of your valuable Magazine, I offered to the public some
remarks upon Mr. Graham's Law of the Diffusion of Gases,
endeavouring to reconcile Mr. Graham's facts with Mr. Dal.
ton's theory.    Mr. Graham, in his Elements of Chemistry,
p. 75, thus notices my remarks:—“The law of the diffusion of
gases has on this account been viewed by my friend, Mr. T. S.
Thomson of Clitheroe, as a confirmation of Dr. Dalton's
theory, that gases are inelastic towards each othert. It must
be admitted that the ultimate result in diffusion is in strict
accordance with Dalton’s law, but there are certain circum
stances which make me hesitate in adopting it as a true re
presentation of the phaenomenon, although it affords a con

            Before diffusion.                              After diffusion.
After diffusion the dissimilar particles have obviously on the
whole approached each other, and the similar ones receded
from each other; what is true of two atoms is true of any
number.
   It is curious that the same mathematical formula by which
I expressed    the conditions of the question on the inelastic hy
pothesis are equally applicable to the attractive theory.
   It is an instance of Newton’s third law of motion, that action
and reaction are equal, and the very same formula applies to
attractive as to repulsive forces, simply by the change of sign
(plus or minus) + or –.
   There are many collateral applications of this idea, for
the explanation of which               I
                               shall at some future period again

same field, may lead to a more precise knowledge of their
character and constitution.
   2. In systematic works on chemistry reference is made to
this subject in a very general way. The sum of such infor
mation may be thus expressed:—“The soluble cyanides of
the alkaline metals, potassium, sodium, &c., dissolve the                            in
soluble cyanides of the metals proper, forming double salts,
which are generally crystallizable:” the probable constitution
of only a very few of these salts are given.
    3. From the researches of L. Gmelin upon the metallo
cyanurets, which were published many years ago, it would
appear that there are two classes of compounds in which other
metals are found to replace the iron in the yellow and red
prussiate of potash, and to form indeed metallo-cyanurets and
sesquicyanurets of potassium, &c. There seems however to
be a singular indefiniteness on this subject in chemical works;
for Turner, in his “Elements, 5th edition, p. 779, says, that
“L.     Gmelin has obtained a double cyanuret of zinc and po
tassium, in which the zinc acts as iron in the ferro-cyanurets.”
He also says, “that a cobalto-cyanuret of potassium, and si
milar double cyanurets of nickel and cobalt, may be prepared
in the same manner as the preceding salt;” and further,
“that Gmelin procured the cobalto-cyanuret in yellow cry
stals, similar in composition and form to ferro-cyanuret of po
tassium.” The salts here described are evidently analogous
to the yellow prussiate of potassa, or ferro-cyanuret of po
tassium; but on referring to Professor Graham’s ‘System, we
find there described salts of cobalt, chromium and manganese,
not analogous to yellow prussiate of potash, but similar in
                                                                                     in is,
symbolic constitution to the red prussiate of potash, that
metallo-sesquicyanurets having             supposed salt radical
which these metals       replace  iron       to a
                                           the formation          cobalti-,
                                                                     of
chromi-, and mangani-cyanogen; no mention                     made what
                                                                is

a  description       a

to   replace iron. He says, “The existence             this salt,

 Here also Berzelius corroborates the statement made                    Dr.
 Turner, and speaks           these compounds
                             of                        analogous
                                                        as               the
 yellow prussiate       of
                        potassa,       ormetallo-cyanurets. Turner
                                            as
 mentions (p. 780) that Gmelin's observations upon the nickel,
 copper and zinco-cyanurets have been confirmed                       bylate a

                  º
 58                        Messrs. Glassford and Napier on the
  pupil of his, Mr. F. Rodgers, and his brother; on referring
  to their Memoir, published in the Philosophical Magazine
  of February 1834, we find a different statement from what
  Dr. Turner makes; they say,                              “L.
                                            Gmelin prepared a double
  cyanuret of cobalt and potassium, analogous to the red cya
  nuret of iron and potassium.” These different statements of
 apparently the same thing must have arisen either from the
  want of proper care in naming the salts, so as to indicate to
  which class they belong, or to the want of sufficient evidence
 respecting their constitution. We may render this still more
 evident by the following statements.              Berzelius mentions a
 cyanure                                platino-cyanuret of potassium,
 but on referring to                      its
                              alleged constitution, we        not find,                do               as
 its  name   indicates,     compound a     platina   similar   ofthe ferro                  to
 cyanuret       potassium, but
                   of                compound totally different from
                                                     a

which was translated into the Philosophical Magazine for
August, entitled, “On some new combinations                  Cyanogen.”                of
The author      says,   “The    peculiar manner         which cyanogen    in
acts towards     iron,       forming  by
                                       two  very   stable acids with                                   it,
leads        the supposition that
             to                              not the only metal with
                                                          it   is
which cyanogen           capableis   combining.      of fact, some Ger        In
man chemists, and Gmelin among others, have discovered
three new compounds, which are platino-cyanogen, cobalto

                            Cyanides       of the Metals.                        59
cyanogen, and chromo-cyanogen,                    and afterwards the          hydro
genated acids analogous to ferro-hydrocyanic acid, and seve
ral other metallic salts.” Here again we have more evidence
of the singular confusion with which this subject has become
invested.    Ifwe are to accept these names for what they ex
press, and as yet we have no reason to do otherwise, we must
infer that these metallo-cyanogens are analogous to the ferro
cyanogen; but this is not the case, for we have just shown
that platino-cyanide of potassium is not similar in constitution
to the ferro-cyanide of potassium.      Meillet then proceeds to
say, “ that the processes employed by these chemists were
somewhat complicated, and they had not continued their ex
periments;” the method which he employed, he says, “is
simple, and there may be procured by it a great number of
perfectly definite compounds.”      The remainder of the paper
is taken   up  with a brief description  of the characteristics of
these salts; among others he mentions the auro-, the argento
and the cupro-cyanides of potassium, classifying these under
their supposed salt radicles, as auro-cyanogen, argento-cya
nogen, and cupro-cyanogen. It is in the consideration of these
various metallic combinations with cyanogen, that we have
made the following investigations.      Before commencing the
detail of these, we must offer a few observations upon the
cyanide of potassium as usually prepared, and as employed by
Meillet in his experiments.
   5. The cyanide of potassium which is employed by us in
our daily operations is prepared according to the process first
pointed out by Messrs. F. and E. Rodgers, now generally
known by the appellation “Liebig’s Process;” from what
particular cause it came to be so named we know not, unless
it may have been that the publication of this process by Pro
fessor Liebig occurred at a time when the attention of prac
tical and scientific men were more particularly drawn towards
an attentive consideration of this compound, from        important      its
applications       chemical
                  in        analyses,  and      extensive employ
                                                            its
ment  in  the new art       electro-metallurgy.
                                 of                 To show, how
ever, that this process was known long before this illustrious
                                                     quote the fol
                                               of be
chemist pointed       out, we may
                       it               allowed                    to
 lowing passage from the memoir         Messrs. Rodgers, alread
 mentioned   as having been published       the Philosophical Ma
                                                       in
 gazine for February 1834.       After detailing  the various pro
 cesses then  known,  and others which  they  had discovered, they
 describe this   process     follows:—“Cyanuret
                                 as                      potassium      of
 may  be  prepared          by
                         exposing     mixture a    anhydrous car  of
 bonate of   potash and anhydrous ferro-cyanuret         potassium      of
toa   moderate red heat,          covered porcelain crucible, for
                                      in
                                       a
 about twenty minutes.” “The proportions employed should

60            Messrs. Glassford and Napier on the
be nearly 1 eq. of anhydrous carbonate of potash to 1 eq. of
 the anhydrous ferro-cyanuret of potassium.       The process is
very productive, for the weight of the cyanuret of potassium
obtained by this process is much greater than the weight of
the cyanuret obtained by heating ferro-cyanuret of potassium
alone, owing to the cyanogen of the cyanuret of iron uniting
with the potassium contained in the carbonate of potash; and,
moreover, the process occupies less time. Some carburet of
 iron always remains in the crucible.”
    6. Cyanide of potassium may be obtained pure for experi
mental investigation in the laboratory by the use of absolute
alcohol; but where hundred weights are prepared and used
at a time this is not admissible. As employed in the arts it
contains many impurities: these are chiefly cyanate, carbonate,
muriate and sulphate of potash, silica, and yellow prussiate of
potash.    The average amount of these impurities is 35 per
cent., often as high as 50 per cent.     It contains much silica
when prepared, as is usually directed, in earthenware cruci
bles; and when the exact proportions of the yellow prussiate
of potash or carbonate of potash are not employed; when
these are not perfectly anhydrous, salts of ammonia are gene
rated; and when commercial carbonate of potash is used, mu
riate and sulphate of potash.     Even when the materials are
employed chemically pure and perfectly anhydrous, it contains
20 per cent. of cyanate of potash; this, according to Professor
Liebig, is of little consequence in the ordinary operations of
testing, but in respect to analytical inquiry, and to electro
metallurgical operations, we find it of the greatest importance.
As however we shall have opportunities of pointing these out
in detail, we only allude to them here in a general way.
    7. When nitrate of silver is added to solution of cyanide of
potassium, just so long as the precipitate which is at first
formed is redissolved, we obtain the whole of the cyanide of
potassium in union with the silver, none of the other salts
present, although amounting to a large per-centage, taking
any part in the action. Upon this law we have founded a
method of estimating the exact quantity of pure cyanide of
potassium in any sample; as, however, the principle upon
which this depends can be better explained when the nature
and constitution of the cyanide salt of silver is described, we
shall return to it when treating of that metal.
    8. As when one eq. of chloride of gold combines with one
eq. of chloride of potassium, a double salt, called chloride of
gold and potassium, is formed, so shall we call the union of
one eq. of cyanide of gold with one eq. of cyanide of potassium
the “cyanide of gold and potassium,” and apply similar names
to the other metallic salts having a like constitution.     The

                                       Cyanides          of the Metals.                                             61
terms double-cyanides, bicyanides, &c., which are usually
given to such compounds, we consider neither necessary nor
sufficiently expressive.
    9. The equivalent numbers employed are those given in
Dr. Turner’s ‘System,” namely,–Cyanogen 26:39, potassium
39:15, cyanide of potassium 65'54, gold 199:20, cyanide of
gold 225'59.
    10. Cyanide of Gold.—Little is said in any systematic trea
tise of the cyanide of gold. Berzelius, almost the only chemist
who mentions this compound, says, “That this salt presents
itself under the form of a pale yellow substance, insoluble in
water, which is obtained by precipitating the chloride of gold
with cyanide of potassium, and gives as                     composition the           its
formula     Au,   Cys.”   Kane also mentions this         pale  yellow com
pound, and gives                       composition.                 readily
                                                                                                                        of be

   13. When a saturated solution of cyanide of potassium is
added, in small portions, to a cold and strong solution of      ni
tromuriate of gold, there is at first a violent effervescence, the
solution becomes slightly turbid, and then quite transparent.
The reaction may be explained as follows:—
   The first effect is the neutralization of the excess of nitric
and muriatic acids contained in the nitro-muriate of gold.
This results at the expense of the cyanate of potash and cya
nide of potassium.

and metallic taste. They are perfectly colourless and trans
parent, but seem opake from being composed of numerous
small crystals. They are soluble in four times their weight
of cold water, and in less than their own weight of boiling
water, in the proportion of 5 to 4.            They are very sparingly
dissolved by alcohol, and their solubility is not increased by
boiling.     When alcohol is added to a warm saturated solu
tion of the crystals, the salt falls in fine white brilliant shining
scales, which are quite opake.           Their solution does not stain
the hands by the action of light, neither is the solution affected
by exposure to light.       When nitric, muriatic, or sulphuric
acid is  poured   over the  crystals,    they are not affected at first,
but   by standing   some time     they      are quite decomposed, and
cyanide of gold results.        The    cyanide     of gold occasionally
precipitates in minute shining crystals from the nitric solution.
Their solution is not immediately effected in the cold by these
acids, but a boiling temperature decomposes them, the yellow
cyanide of gold precipitating.              Tartaric, oxalic and acetic
acids effect the same    decomposition        when boiled. The nitric,
muriatic and sulphuric acids added to a cold saturated solu
tion precipitate the salt undecomposed. The following me
tallic solutions were added to a solution of the salt, and the
results were as follows:–
Nitrate of copper . . a white precipitate of the mixed cyanides.
Sulphate of zinc. . .                e - e.                    e - e.

 bonate of potash, the whole of the gold is obtained in the me
 tallic state as a bright button. The carefully dried salt was
 treated in this way and the following results obtained:—

nide of potassium contains any chlorides or undecomposed
ferrocyanide, these impurities cannot be separated by this
means.    The best method of obtaining cyanide of silver free
from all these impurities, is to add a solution of nitrate of sil

silver. Pure cyanide of silver precipitates, although the cya

test papers, proves the absence of free potash; and the pre

ride of silver.   It is mentioned in Prof. Graham’s “Elements
of Chemistry,     upon the authority of Prof. Liebig, that the
chloride of silver is soluble in cyanide of potassium, and that
the solution yields a double salt by evaporation.       We have
repeatedly tried to obtain this double salt, but cannot say we
have been successful; it requires two equivalents of cyanide
of potassium to obtain the chloride apparently in solution,
which then contains chloride of potassium and cyanide of
potassium and silver: by repeated crystallization and taking
the first crop, we get the latter salt free from the former,
which was determined by dissolving some of the crystals thus
purified in water and saturating the solution with nitrate of
silver. The precipitate being afterwards boiled in sulphuric
acid, as noticed in a former part of the present paper, the
whole precipitate was dissolved, which would not have occur
red had any chloride been present.
   It is upon this superior power of silver to combine with
cyanide of potassium to form the double salt just described,
that we have adopted the method of determining the per-cent
age of cyanide of potassium in any sample.       Nitrate of silver
is dissolved in distilled water to such a strength, that two gra
duations of a common alkalimeter will contain exactly 1 grain
of nitrate of silver; 25 grains of the sample to be tried are
dissolved, and this solution of nitrate of silver is added cau
tiously until the precipitate formed ceases to be redissolved;
the number of graduations of the silver solution taken are noted,
and calculated according to the following equation:--as 170 is
to 65.5 so is the number of graduations taken, to the answer,
which must be multiplied by 4 to obtain the per-centage.       Ni
trate of silver of any strength may be used without a graduated
measure, but the solution must in that case be evaporated to
dryness, treated with hydrochloric acid, again evaporated to
dryness, and fused to know the quantity of silver taken; the
amount of cyanide of potassium may be known by the following
calculation —As 108.0 is to 131-68 (2 equivalents of cyanide
of potassium), so is the weight of silver obtained multiplied
 by 4 to the per-centage of cyanide of potassium in the sample.
    The substitution of cyanide of potassium for any other
substance which may be in union with silver is beautifully
shown by adding cyanide of potassium to ferrocyanide of si<U+017F>.
 ver: it requires 4 equivalents of the former to I of the latter
 to produce 2 equivalents of cyanide of potassium and silver,
and 1 of ferrocyanide of potassium; the solution being eva
porated the two salts crystallize distinct, and may be easily
separated both by their shape and colour.          In some expe
riments of this kind we have been able to recover within one

 per cent of the whole of the ferrocyanide of potassium origi
 nally used in precipitating the silver.
     When cyanide of potassium is added to the ferridcyanide
 of silver a similar substitution takes place, requiring 6 equiva
 lents of cyanide of potassium to get the whole into solution;
 but the primary action is somewhat different in this salt from
 any other we have tried. When cyanide of potassium is added
 to ferrocyanide of silver, the formation of the double salt of
 silver and potassium, and the ferrocyanide of potassium, are
 simultaneous; and if there be not 4 equivalents of cyanide of
potassium added, the remaining precipitate is undecomposed
ferrocyanide of silver.        But on adding cyanide of potassium
to the   ferridcyanide    of silver,  the first action is the decompo
sition of the whole      ferridcyanide     of silver, with the formation
of cyanide of silver and ferridcyanide of potassium; 3 equi
valents of cyanide of potassium effect this change, the preci
pitates passing from an orange to a white; the ferridcyanide
of potassium may be decanted from the precipitate without
having any silver in solution.           Several other interesting re
actions take place with these substances, which have not yet
been sufficiently investigated to be brought forward. In con
clusion, however, we may mention a reaction with the ferro
cyanides of the metals, which, so far as we are aware, has
not yet been observed in any chemical work; it is that the fer
rocyanides of the metals are converted into the ferridcyanides
by adding an excess of nitric acid to these compounds;                   for                        if,

 to circumstances, the proto- and perchlorides of iron with excess of
 arsenite or arseniate of potash.
     Protoarsenite of Iron.—This is immediately precipitated in whitish
 flocks; but by washing and the contact of the air, it soon becomes
 of an ochre-yellow colour. Dried in this state and heated in a tube,
 it yields water, and afterwards fuses, swells up and produces a white
 crystalline sublimate of arsenious acid. The fused mass is of a deep
 rust colour.
    When treated with potash it becomes of a very black colour,
 which is to be attributed to the black magnetic oxide resulting from
 the partial oxidizement of the protoxide of iron; by continued ex
 posure to the air while moist, it became of the brown colour of hy
 drated peroxide of iron.
    Perarsenite of Iron.—This was of a fine ochre-yellow colour, which
 did not alter during washing carried on in contact with the air. Dried
 and heated in a glass tube it swelled up and fused, yielding at first
 water and afterwards a white sublimate of arsenious acid. When
 treated with potash the greater portion of it was dissolved; the solu
 tion, as well as the undissolved portion, were of the colour of rust
 of iron.
    Protoarseniate of Iron.—Recently precipitated it is of a white
colour, but becomes bluish-gray by exposure to the air. Dried at a
moderate heat and then heated to redness in a tube it fused, yielding
water and a white sublimate, which was not crystalline, but destroyed
the transparency of the glass; the fused mass became of a blackish
colour. The protoarseniate, which had partly become arseniate of
the black oxide of iron, by exposure to the air, was mixed with
potash and became immediately of a black colour; this, by some
days’ exposure to the air while moist, became of the brown colour
of hydrated peroxide of iron.
    Protoarseniate of iron dissolved in cold hydrochloric acid, and
treated with a few drops of a solution of chloride of sodium and
gold, soon occasioned the production of a considerable quantity of a
brown powder, which, when exposed to the heat of the blowpipe,
fused into a brilliant globule.
    Perarseniate of Iron was white with a tint of gray; washed in con
                 it its
tact with the air    appearance did not alter. After drying      mode

DESCRIPTION     AND ANALYSIS OF PENNINE.             BY MM. MARIGNAC
                           AND DESCLOIZEAUX.
   This substance, discovered and named by M. Fröbel              Zurich,
                                                                    of
occurs in crystals   or large lamellar crystalline masses.
   The primary form       is   an
                              acute rhomboid   of63° 15'. The very small
crystals only possess this form perfectly; the larger ones are very
deeply truncated  in     direction perpendicular
                          a                         the axis,

                                                                   so
become tables  of  less      greater thickness, with triangular
                              or                                   hexa or
gonal bases, the planes        which are triangles
                               of                    trapeziums, forming

alternately with the base an acute angle of 79° 30', and an obtuse
supplementary angle. This substance cleaves readily into very small
laminae perpendicular to the axis; when these are not too thick they
may be broken in the direction of the three sides of an equilateral
triangle, parallel to three faces of the rhomboid.
   The hardness on the bases rather exceeds that of gypsum, and on
the faces of the rhomboid it is nearly equal to that of carbonate of
lime; the thin laminae are very ductile, but not elastic; the powder,
which is light greenish-white, is greasy to the feel.
   The specific gravity varies from 2:653 to 2-659; this difference
appears to be owing to the presence, in some of the crystals, of oc
tahedral iron.
    When heated to redness in a tube, water is obtained; it splits into
leaves before the blowpipe, becomes white and fuses with difficulty
into a gray enamel. It dissolves in the salt of phosphorus, or leaves a
skeleton of silica; the glass, coloured by the iron while hot, becomes
opaline on cooling.           With soda on a strip of platina a slight yellow
colour is  produced.
    When in fine powder it is perfectly acted upon by long boiling in
hydrochloric acid.
   Two very pure crystals from the valley of Zermatt in the Valais,
and a third in foliated crystalline masses from the valley of Binnen
(Valais), gave by analysis the                   results:—

   Pennine is found in amianthiform chloritic slate, in the serpen
tine rocks near Monte Rosa. It was first observed in crystals ha
ving the appearance of long triangular prisms, which are merely            ill
formed rhomboids, in a grayish-white schist in the valley of Binnen;

   ON THE PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN CHLO
               RATES.           BY M. ALEXANDER WAECHTER.
    Chlorate of Lithia-This compound was prepared by dissolving
 carbonate of lithia in solution of chloric acid. The neutral liquor
 was evaporated over sulphuric acid; it yielded no crystals of deter
minate form, but became a radiating crystalline mass. It was pressed
between folds of blotting paper, and then perfectly dried over sul
phuric acid.
    The chlorate of lithia thus procured is a white, deliquescent saline
 mass, which is very soluble in alcohol; it fuses at 122°Fahr., and
begins to lose water, oxygen and a little chlorine at 284°; when
heated till gas ceases to be evolved, there remains chloride of lithium

with alkaline reaction. To determine the composition of this chlo
rate it was first converted into a chloride by hydrochloric acid, and
afterwards into sulphate by sulphuric acid. It is a neutral salt com

   Chlorate of Ammonia.—This was obtained by decomposing chlorate
of barytes with carbonate of ammonia; the clear solution was evapo
rated over sulphuric acid, and yielded prismatic crystals, the form of
which could not be accurately determined.               This salt is very soluble
in water,  and but little so in absolute alcohol.           Vauquelin states er
roneously, that this salt is volatilized below the boiling point of
water; when heated to 215°Fahr. it decomposes suddenly, exhibit
ing a red light. The products of the decomposition are the vapour
of water, azote, chlorine, oxygen, hydrochloric acid and hydrochlo
rate of ammonia. When mixed with combustible substances, it de
tonates as the chlorate of potash does.             In order to determine the
composition of this salt it was first converted into chloride of potas
sium, which was decomposed by nitrate of silver. It was found to be

   Chlorate of Barytes.—This salt emits light while crystallizing; its
form is a rhombic prism; when heated to 248° it loses 5-88 per cent.
of water, and begins to yield oxygen at 482°; at above 752° it fuses,
and then yields all its oxygen with a trace of chlorine.              If the heat
be quickly raised, it decomposes suddenly with detonation; when
mixed with combustible bodies it decomposes, like the chlorate of
potash, by percussion. It is very sparingly soluble in absolute alcohol,
 and colours the flame of alcohol deep green.

                    ON  THE CHLORIDES             OF GOLD.
   Great difficulty has hitherto occurred in preparing the chloride of
gold, of the yellow and red colours, perfectly soluble in water and
without suffering reduction.         The following processes are recom
 mended for this   purpose:—
    1st. In order to prepare the yellow salt of gold, take aqua regia
prepared with three parts of hydrochloric acid, one part of nitric acid
 and one of distilled water.      Then put one part of pure gold into a
porcelain capsule and pour the aqua regia upon it; cover the capsule
with a plate of glass and heat it in a salt water bath, the heat being
continued till red vapours cease; the cover is then to be removed,
and if the gold is not entirely dissolved, some aqua regia is to be

added to       it;
                the capsule being again covered, the heat is to be con
tinued till  vapour  ceases to appear; the glass plate must then be re
moved and     replaced   by folds of blotting-paper, the heat being con
tinued in the    bath,  until a glass rod being immersed in the capsule,
it becomes     covered,  on removing                                it,
                                             with yellow, solid chloride                                                   of
8 old.
    The capsule       thenis       removed from the salt-water bath, and
                                          to     be

 with diluted hydrochloric acid, the colouring principle is dissolved,
 and pure green oxide of chromium is left.
    When solution of ammonia is poured directly upon the crystals of
 bresilin, they become immediately of a deep purple-red colour; but
 without the contact of air little change is produced.
    Potash and soda give with bresilin, in contact with air, the colour
 of venous blood, which hydrochloric acid precipitates in an hour.
 Lime water reddens the solution of bresilin; nitrate of silver and
 chloride of gold are reduced when boiled with bresilin, while acetate
 of lead gives a whitish-yellow precipitate, becoming brown by dry
 ing. When decomposed by heat no traces of ammonia are per
ceptible.

XII.     Desultory Remarks on Academic and Non-Academic
          Mathematics and Mathematicians.         By     J. *         J.
THE        general utility of the mathematics as a mental disci
        pline will not perhaps be disputed. The study which
 consists of a constant reference to fundamental principles, ge
 nerates habits of strict reasoning and fortifies the mind against
casuistry and plausible assertion. Dugald Stewart ascribes pe
culiar and supereminent advantages to mathematicians, in
consequence of the definite phraseology that they employ.
   The benefits which have resulted to mankind from the cul
tivation of the mathematics cannot be denied. All our na
tional greatness that rests on commerce, arts or arms, is based
on mathematics actually applied to the concerns of life. How
ever, the usefulness of mathematical learning appears to be ge
nerally admitted: at our principal seminaries it receives beco
ming attention. Oxford has lately made it a subject by which
her favourite sons may gain distinction.         At Cambridge it
leads to the    highest   honours which that     University   has to
confer. Cambridge has long been justly celebrated for             pe            its
culiar favour   to mathematics,    and the number      eminent ma of
thematicians that has produced prove that that seat

84                Desultory Remarks on Academic and
ambitious.       It is not intended to assert that mathematicians
cannot be made without such inducements; some of our most
celebrated ones have been their own tutor; but generally speak
ing, the above is the mode of making mathematicians, and it
seems to be in conformity with the maxim, “In ediscendis
scientiis exempla plus prosunt quam praecepta.”
    At our colleges and institutions most of our statesmen,
lawyers, military men, &c., lay the foundation for their future
 eminence. It often does happen that even the senior wrangler
gains no subsequent distinction; and we have seen the winner
of the wooden spoon afterwards brilliantly work his way up
 to the bench, and then prove himself to be an ornament, even
amongst the most distinguished judges.               Let not, therefore,
the unfortunate despair; but, generally, marked success at col
lege or public institutions is a prelude to future eminence, and
a very important step towards                    it.

90                    Desultory Remarks on Academic and
 however, a schism has taken place among mathematicians of
 our country; those not educated at the universities have pre
 served the art of computation, while those who come from the
 universities have well nigh abandoned it entirely.              Let any
 one compare the questions proposed in the Lady's or Gen
 tleman's Diary, the classical works of the non-academic stu
 dent in England with those given to the candidates for honours
 at Cambridge, and he will see that the problems which are to
 be answered numerically are at least three times as large a
 per-centage in the former as in the latter. We regret this
 prevailing fashion of the University of Cambridge; we think
 that a little systematic attention to the acquisition of arithmetic
expertness would very much increase the amount of power
acquired by the students.          We think also that the demand
for such qualifications would act most advantageously upon
the preparatory education.”
    I  have made this rather long quotation instead of simply re
ferring to the article, in the hope that it may meet the eye and
§º.
arrest the attention of writers who can speak reproachfully of
              of calculation and detail. The regret which Mr.
    e  Morgan     professes to feel for the prevailing fashion at
 Cambridge may, I think, be extended more generally. Within
 the last few years there has been, or                     I
                                               fancy there has been, a
tendency to adopt the fashion referred to in works intended
for non-academic students. I wish by no means to depreciate
mere theoretical problems; perhaps there ought to be a fair
proportion of that description; but when we consider that the
greater number of our really working mathematicians belong
to the non-academic order, that they commonly commence
their career in the publications alluded to and complete their
qualifications in some measure according to the models there
given, it     is, think,
                  I          very high importance that questions

92 Desultory Remarks on Mathematics and Mathematicians.
ingenuity of all. The mathematical essay may obtain the
student's perusal and possibly add to his knowledge; but                 do                 I
not think it is so    likely  to arrest his attention and set his abi
lities to work as a set of problems adapted to his acquirements
or going a little beyond them would be.
    Had the preceding observations been steadily kept to the
point instead of being desultory in the widest sense of the
word, they might have ended here; but now I must beg to
trouble the reader with a brief recapitulation, to set before
him more distinctly the object of this article.
    The importance of the mathematical sciences has been taken
for granted, and it has been endeavoured to make known the
facts, that the mode of cultivating them at Cambridge and at
other seminaries of lesser note is by continual exercise in ap
plying principles to the solutions of problems, &c.; that the
student is not only exercised in this way, but that he is also
enticed and encouraged by prizes and honorary distinctions,
well adapted to make him exert his abilities to the utmost.
                                                                        º

matical education is well known, and perhaps it is the best
scheme to effect            its

devise.       has been assumed, that

XIV.    Strictures on Professor Dove's Essay “On the Law of
    Storms,” introduced by Remarks on Mr. Redfield's recent
    communication          on that subject.          By Robert HARE, M.D.,
    Professor     of   Chemistry in the University             of Pennsylvania.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
       GENTLEMEN,
      OBSERVE    that in the Supplementary Number of your
    Journal for January  1844 [S. 3, vol. xxiii. p. 481], Mr. W.
C. Redfield makes great complaints of my apparent want of
candour in quoting his opinions and neglecting his replies. Ac
cording to my opinion the errors committed by Mr. Redfield
may be advantageously distinguished into two classes: in one,
those urged in support of his theory of storms should be placed;
in the other, such as have arisen from his misapprehension of
my motives and my arguments. Excepting in a few cases, I do
not propose to occupy the pages of your valuable Journai with
any notice of the latter class. In publishing my objections to the
whirlwind theory, I did not flatter myself with any expectation
that they would change Mr. Redfield's opinions. I anticipated
that one who could construe the phaenomena of nature in a way
so repugnant to my idea of science and reason, would not be
likely to accord with me in the validity of any objections which
I  might urge. Hence I announced the intention of not ad
dressing my arguments to him, and it is my opinion that were
I  to do so it would only multiply our differences.
    The more           I
                     contemplate the whirlwind theory, upon the
assumed correctness of which Mr. Redfield and his disciples
were circulating instructions to mariners which I deemed
                                     I
fallacious, the more was convinced of the utter incompetency
of any evidence which could be adduced to establish an hypo
thesis involving so much that was inconsistent with              that             all
knew    of  the laws      motion, and the meteorological efficacy
                           of                                                                of I
heat and electricity.       This opinion was strengthened when                               I
found that the observations            which his theory was repre

 sented     asestablished, beyond  the  reach     my objections, were
                                                          of
 replete with contradiction and inconsistency.
    Aware that while entertaining these impressions          might           it               be
                   justice                                truth,  with

                                                          to                                 in
 sending my additional objections                    to
                                              Professor Silliman for
publication,      Irequested him     point out any

 which      he might   deem  unduly   unpleasant;    accordingly,                            all
 that  to  which my judicious friend objected was modified          left                or
 out, though very little change was advised.          have mentioned

of indisposition to give Mr. Redfield unnecessary pain, that                                     I
have so expressed myself as to cause his displeasure.
   Agreeably to the notice subjoined to the essay entitled                                ‘Ad
ditional Objections,’ published in the Number of your Journal
for August last,       I
                    send you a copy of my strictures on Dove's
Law of Storms.      By the next opportunity   will send another    I
communication, in which                 I
                             shall advance some further proofs,
that if such whirlwind storms as have been imagined by Red
field, Dove and others, could be created by the causes which
they have suggested, they could not endure, after the cessa
tion of the generating forces, longer than might be requisite
to restore the equilibrium deranged by the centrifugal force
consequent to the gyration.
                                    I am, Gentlemen,               respectfully,
                                                       Your obedient Servant,

    104.    I    have not been enabled to discover that Professor
Dove       attempts to assign any cause for violent winds. As
suming that a wind, sufficiently violent, is blowing from south
to north, he ingeniously makes a new application of the old
doctrine of Halley, by which the westerly motion of the trade
winds is ascribed to the diversity of the velocity of the earth's
surface, at different distances from the equator, operating upon
a wind blowing from one parallel of latitude to another.                                         I
am however unable to understand how any difference of mo
mentum, thus arising, can act throughout               parts        all
                                                                                 of of

requisite     enduring gyration.

upon each quadrant, nor each zone                         of

     112. Professor Dove has not considered the incompetency
 of a local cause of deflection to beget permanency of rotation
 in a travelling storm; nor the impossibility of the endurance
 of a momentum sufficient to cause the violence of hurricanes
 without continuous exciting forces.
     113. In a passage which I shall in the next place quote, the
 idea is advanced that the axis of a whirlwind may incline for
 ward so as to cause the higher portion to precede the lower,
 and to make the lower stratum of the air forming the whirl
 exchange places with the upper stratum.                  This view of the
 phaenomena          I
                   shall endeavour to prove erroneous.
     114. In Taylor's Scientific Memoirs, already cited, vol. iii.
 p. 215, paragraph 3, Professor Dove has thus expressed
 himself:-“In considering the progressive advance of the
 whirlwind, we have not hitherto taken into account the re
 sistance opposed to the motion of the air by the surface of the
 earth. This resistance, as Redfield justly remarks, causes the
 rotating cylinder to incline forward in the direction of                ad           its
 vance,        so
              that    any station the whirlwind begins
                         at                                      the higher    in

 its near approach.        The inclined position                     of
                                                          the axis causes                      a
 continual intermixture of the lower and warmer strata of the
air with the upper and colder ones, thereby occasioning heavy
falls      rain and proportionably violent electric explosions.”

98            Dr. Hare's Strictures                on Dove's Essay
for every degree.      The altitude of storm-winds is well known
not to be above two miles, so that the diameter would be at
least 180 times as great as the altitude of the axis.          Can such
a cylindrical mass of air be conceived to incline forward ” One
degree of inclination would lift the base in the rear three miles,
and two degrees would lift it to the height of six miles, which
is never attained by clouds. Besides, as the density of the air
in regions so elevated is only one half of that upon the earth's
surface, is it conceivable that a whirlwind could consist of ma
terials so disproportioned in weight?
    116. Can the suggested process of circulation proceed when,
in order for the lower stratum to exchange places with the
upper, it would have to move nearly half of the circumference
of the storm, or more than five hundred miles?
    117. It has been shown that the rotating cylinder of air
which constitutes a hurricane, agreeably to the language em
ployed, and the theory espoused by Prof. Dove, may consist
ently with the observed dimensions of storms, have a diameter
two hundred times as great as                  its
                                          altitude. The base,         this      of

XV.      Further considerations            on the Eristence              of a   Fourth          Im
     ponderable.  By John WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D., Professor
     of Chemistry in the University of New York”.
   the Philosophical Magazine for December 1842, I brought
IN forward  several facts which had caused me to form the
 opinion that the chemical rays of the older optical writers
 constitute in reality a new imponderable substance, which
 should be placed in the same rank with light, heat and elec
 tricity.    To the views then given I propose, in this commu
nication, to return again, and furnish further proof of their
correctness. An extended examination, which has occupied
 me several years, has served to deepen my conviction of the
truth of this doctrine.
    Great changes in the fundamental theories of science ought
not to be lightly admitted.          It was only after many years of
discussion and multitudes of experiments that the doctrine of
the unity of air was destroyed, and the theory of the intrinsic
differences of gaseous bodies received.            This was unquestion
ably the most important event that ever happened to che
mistry.
    The imponderable principles are the true Living Forces of
chemistry. The circumstance that they do not exhibit the
property of weight is only an incidental affair, and ought never
to have been regarded as their leading characteristic; they
are the regulating forces by which ponderable matter is ar
ranged and grouped.                 If,
                                   then,      great so  change occurred
                                                                    a
in  chemistry      on more exact views being obtained               pneu        of   its
matic department, what may not                      be
                                             expected from the discus
sions which are arising             on
                                  the nature                  of   its
                                                       great controlling
forces?
    There     is another point       view from which these investiga
                                     of
tions assume       a  deep interest.         have shown (Phil. Mag.,

104.         Dr. Draper's Further    considerations
veloped perhaps in a less elaborate way, but under the gui
dance of a principle equally aethereal and refined. The beams
of the sun are the true NERyous PRINCIPLE of plants. To the
yellow ray is assigned their nutritive processes, to the blue
their movements.       We can therefore easily understand how
 it is that botanists who have sought in the interior of plants
 for indications of a nervous agent have never found them.
 That agent is external.
     By the experiments that have been made for determining
 the nature of the chemical radiations, the question has been
 brought down to very narrow limits. There is no author who
 regards them as connected in any way with radiant heat, nor
 any, except the wildest speculator, who traces them to elec
 tricity.   The difficulty is to offer clear and undoubted proof
 that  they are distinct from light. . Herschel has directly ad
 mitted this distinction and brought forward several experi
 ments (Phil. Trans. 1840, p. 38, &c.) in support of this view.
I   have given some evidence of the kind, both recently and
 also several years ago (1837). All these experiments de
 pend on a comparison of tithonographic stains produced by
 solar spectra that have undergone the action of absorptive
 media, and the effect of those spectra on the organ of vision;
 a comparison, in short, of different visible spectra and their
 tithonographic impressions.
    From this comparison we endeavour to prove that invisible
rays may be isolated in any part of the spectrum, and, if invi
 sible, we argue that they are not light.
    It cannot be concealed, however, that there is a certain
degree of imperfection in this species of evidence: an accurate
conclusion as to the presence or absence, or quantity of light,
is by no means under these circumstances an easy affair. In
these distorted spectra, as in the natural one, the terminations
shade off gradually, and it is difficult to say where the light in
reality ends.    On these terminations also, where the light is
so dilute and feeble, tithonographic action, although faint,
may, by prolonged exposure, become not only perceptible but
even prominent.       In tithonographic action time enters as an
element, in the act of vision it does not. A feeble gleam does
not become more bright by constantly looking at       it,
                                                       but sen

                                 a     gleamis  more and more af
fected as the time is   increased.
   Considerations like these demonstrate the necessity      of

                                             these matters, has
undertaken   to support   adoctrine which denies the existence
of  the chemical rays and imputes the whole action         light

             on the Eristence       of a Fourth        Imponderable.                     105
  This doctrine, however, will not,                  I
                                                  am persuaded, stand
the test of criticism: there are       facts, and those very imposing
ones, which make it utterly untenable.             It is my object in this
paper to set forth that evidence and offer further and clearer
proof of the physical independence of the tithonic rays and light,
and indirectly establish the existence of a new imponderable.
   The true issue of the question, as has been said, rests in
proving a clear distinction between light and the tithonic rays;
the other imponderables may be left out of the argument.
The mechanical properties of the two agents are so closely
alike, reflexion, refraction, polarization, interference, &c.
taking place under the same laws for both, that the discussion
necessarily becomes one of quantity and measure.                    Will a
given ray of light, disturbed by the action of absorptive media,
change    its luminous and chemical relations pari passu?               can         or
we alter the one and leave the other untouched                or, changing
                                                                         2

                                               both change        the same   to
extent?
   The final decision       ofthis question obviously rests         obtain    in
ing accurate measures for the rays             light and for the tithonic
                                                of

 106              Dr. Draper's Further                        considerations
  and a photometer can be obtained which gives results compa
  rable with those of the tithonometer: such an instrument I
  have constructed; it is exceedingly simple, as the following
  considerations prove.
     We are to remember that the tithonometer gives indications
  which are expressive of the intensity of the blue rays gene
  rally; the blue tithonic rays are the rays which it measures.
  In using the term blue, it will be understood to comprehend
  the blue, indigo and violet, or the more refrangible rays ge
  nerally.    It is obvious, therefore, that the photometer which
 is to be used with it must measure the same blue rays, or in
 other words, the tithonometer and the photometer must be
 affected by rays comprehended between the same limits of re
 frangibility.
    This can be effected by interposing in the photometer some
 absorbent medium which will admit no rays to pass                     except                    it,
 such  as  are   inthe limits          of

liminary observation should be made, and, if necessary, the
proper adjustments secured.
     Suppose now it were required to know how much blue light
is transmitted by a given solution.                 A trough is to be pro
vided, which may be formed by drilling a hole two and a half
inches in diameter through a thick piece of plate glass; on
each side of this a thin piece of similar glass is laid, the trough
having been filled with the solution under investigation.
 Troughs made in this manner never leak; they completely
 answer their purpose, and are easily washed and refilled.
     Let the substance under trial be a concentrated solution of
 bichromate of potash.           Having adjusted the lamps and filled
 the   trough,  set it before one of them, supporting it by a proper
 foot. On      looking    through the tube of the photometer, if the
 absorbent cell of the copper solution has been previously re
 moved, the circle of light will be seen very brightly illumi
 nated; one of              its

 108               Dr. Draper's Further                      considerations
Journal (Dec. 1843, p. 402)                         I
                                           have already stated that silent
  combination would take place under these circumstances, but
  more recently I have had instruments repeatedly destroyed by
  explosions resulting in that way.
      It being understood that the indications of the photometer
  and the tithonometer correspond, that they are affected by rays
  of the same refrangibility, we are enabled to proceed to the
  direct solution of the question and the determination of M.
  Becquerel's hypothesis.
     A transparent medium, which absorbs to a greater or lesser
 extent the more refrangible rays, being selected, it is required
 to determine whether, when a given ray has passed through
it,   the chemical effect diminishes             the intensity
                                                         as            the more      of
 refrangible rays          light diminishes. According
                             of                                         M. Bec          to
 querel, the effect should                 direct proportion
                                              be   in                 the quan       to
 tity  of  light;      if,
                      for example, the ray lost one half                     blue        of    its
 light, the chemical effect should diminish one half, &c.
     We require, therefore, two observations: first with the pho
tometer,     to  ascertain how much               the light escapes the ab
                                                        of
sorptive action          the medium under trial; second, with the
                         of
 tithonometer,         ascertain what quantity
                       to                                                of
                                                            the tithonic rays
escapes absorption.               If
                                the whole effect        due     light, the two
                                                                    is        to
observations should give the same result.
     Before giving the results, which have obtained     I                tabular     in   a
form,   in   order that      may
                              I         clearlybe  understood,       will give     I                   a
particular example.            took some
                                  I           naphtha,    the colour      which              of
was slightly yellow, and placing                    the glass trough before
                                                        it   in
described, proceeded               to
                                  determine                   its
                                                      relation for the more
refrangible rays         light. This was dome

lamps   of    the photometer      till they    coincided,    then interposing
the    trough   between one          theoflamps    and the end         the pho          of

paper was observed; the other lamp was now removed until
the paper disc was uniformly illuminated; the distance                        the                 of

were respectively twelve and fifteen inches; but the intensity
of   the light     proportional

losophical investigation           those  early   astimes can furnish.
These results, which few are now acquainted with, deserve                                                       to

    To Becquerel                 we
                         are indebted for one          the most remark           of

glass,     nolonger preserved the quality             exciting phospho        of

that power unimpaired.          This result very strikingly shown       is

    It    necessary
             is            remark, that the rays from the voltaic

the voltaic deflagration of any metallic bodies, the observation
applies to transient discharges only. A voltaic light, which
lasts but a moment, fails to cause phosphorescence through
glass in the same way that an electric spark does; but if the
discharge is continued, the surface presently begins to glow;
and if maintained for several minutes, it shines as brightly as
though a piece of quartz had been used.
   The inability of an electric spark to cause phosphorescence
is connected with               its
                        transient duration.   The voltaic light

 the characters of the phosphorogenic emanation to do with
 the existence of the tithonic rays as a fourth imponderable?
 A few words will show. From these considerations and ex
 periments we have arrived at the conclusion, that there exist
 in the beams of an electric spark invisible rays, which are there
jore totally distinct from light. They occupy the same spec
 trum region as the tithonic rays which decompose iodide of
 silver; their leading character                          is,

 are principles differing from the tithonic rays and from each

   To establish and illustrate my argument, have ventured                     I
to  inquire whether we cannot reasonably suppose the simple
bodies,       called,
               so                  to    be
                                resolvable into other bodies             the                          of

thus adopting the mode of reasoning, not certainly the best,
but the most available in the absence of experimental proof,
of assuming the premises, and proving or disproving them by
the results arrived at.           To this end I take a review of the
fifty-five bodies termed simple, endeavouring to trace their
relations with one another, and with the bodies which we have
determined by experiment to be compound.
     But one or          all   of

indebted to him than I have allowed. I am not aware that he
has devised a single photographic process; I cannot discover
that he has even improved one.
     Dr. Draper's inquiries into the condition of the solar rays
 have been extensive, and these are distinctly noticed in the
 “Researches.”                 I
                       am now, in justice to myself and others,
 compelled to state that I avoided any reference to Dr. Draper's
 paper on Tithonographic Spectra, published in one of your
journals, to which I cannot at this moment refer, because
 nearly the whole of the prismatic analyses therein described
 had been long previously published by Sir John Herschel in
 the Transactions of the Royal Society, with which memoir
 Dr. Draper was evidently familiar, but which he avoided men
 tioning.    Some other of the “nine-tenths” of the “facts”
published by Dr. Draper, which he says “are not so much as
alluded to,” are in the same position as the above; and having
in your Journal shown the doubtful character of the rest,
 and the absurdity of the Professor's conclusions*, I leave it
 for your readers to decide whether          have not chosen the   I
 safest course in omitting them, when their insertion would have
 tended to involve an intricate subject in error.
     Dr. Draper claims for himself the discovery “of a fourth
 imponderable,” and then continues, “Yet Mr. Hunt, in this
 book, actually appropriates it to himself, and gives the fourth
 imponderable the name of ENERGIA.”          Now if your readers,
 instead of commencing their perusal at “that chapter which
 commences on the 259th page,” will begin at the 243rd page,
I   think they will find I have given Dr. Draper credit for
                                                                                                           of all
 that    he
          has done.      am not inclined
                               I             dispute “the right    to
 proprietorship over that capital fact,” although can prove that                I

of this element on material bodies. I have objected to such a
name, and I have merely suggested the advantages of another
term.       “Might we not then with strict propriety, regarding
this   principle  as the sun's energetic power, working in and

XVIII.     On the occurrence of Fluorine in Recent as well as in
    Fossil Bones.     By CHARLEs DAUBENY, M.D., F.R.S.*
HAVING          in the course of the preceding spring paid a visit
       to the deposit of compact phosphorite which occurs in
the province of Estremadura in Spain, I was subsequently
led to examine into the chemical constitution of the mineral
which forms the prevailing ingredient of the vein to which
my inquiries had been directed.         -
   The results of my examination have already been reported
in the memoir communicated by my fellow-traveller Captain
Widdrington, R.N. and myself to the Geological Society with
respect to the rock in question, and read at their meeting on
the 17th of January last; from which it will be seen, that the
mineral, although, not being crystallized, it is somewhat va
               composition, yet when selected    pure    possible,

             Fluorine in Recent as well as in Fossil Bones.                                                                    123
  The conclusion arrived at with    respect to the compact form
of mineral phosphate of lime occurring in the above locality,
coupled with the reports of other chemists to the same effect
relative to crystallized apatite, naturally led me to speculate
as to the final causes of the apparently constant association of
fluoride of calcium with earthy phosphates amongst the older
materials of the globe, and to ask myself, whether it might
not be possible, that fluorine, as well as phosphorus, fulfilled
some hitherto unexplained office, in the oeconomy of those or
ganic beings, for the sake of which such mineral matters may
be conjectured to have been treasured up in the rock forma
tions from the beginning of time.
   These reflections brought to my mind the researches of
Morichini and of Berzelius with respect to the existence of
fluorine in bones, seeing that the latter, according to the
concurrent testimony of both these philosophers, appear to
calcium by repeated washings with water.          I apprehend, however, that in
this method the whole of the fluorine may not have been driven over, in
spite of     all
            the pains bestowed upon the process.

bedded in a secondary rock belonging to the oolite forma
tion, lost, by exposure to a heat of 212°, 4.2 per cent. ; by a
further heat of about 500°, 5.0 per cent. more, and by increa
sing the temperature to a red heat only 1.8 per cent, in addi
tion, the latter probably representing very nearly the amount
of animal matter remaining, the two former numbers the water
retained within the bone.
    Proceeding upon the same data, the bone from the tertiary
rocks of the Paris basin, next in the order of antiquity, would
contain 10 per cent. of water, 2 of animal matter; the bone
from Gailenreuth, water 13.9, animal matter 5-0; that from
Kirkdale 12-5 water, l l animal matter; whereas the recent
bone picked up in the Botanic Garden contained, even when
dry externally, about 30 per cent. of water and 11 animal
matter; and the human tibia, which had been kept in an
anatomical cabinet for a certain time, gave out 23 per cent. of
water and 17 of animal matter.
    It may also be suggested, as a possible explanation, that the
fluoride of calcium distributed through the mass has in the
course of time become collected into little nuclei in certain
parts of the bone, and for this reason may allow of a more
ready disengagement from it of the fluoric acid which it con
tains as an ingredient.

particles of a bone does occasionally take place after              de                its

may be true, as has been suggested           Von Buch, that the
very prismatic form which belongs to phosphate of lime as a
mineral species, adapts it for the fibrous structure of bone
better than other earthy compounds in which the axis of cry
stallization is equal in both directions, yet even in this case
the tendency to arrange itself according to the laws which
regulate inert matter might operate too powerfully, were it
not diminished by the association in equal atomic weights
of the two phosphates, each of which possesses a polarity in
some degree differing from the other, and consequently to a
certain extent counteracts the disposition in the particles of
the other to assume a determinate arrangement.
  If   there be any truth in these speculations, is it not also
conceivable, that the interposition of a mineral matter, like
fluor spar, whose particles crystallize in quite another manner,
that is in cubes, may cooperate on the same principle, in im
parting that freedom of motion to the particles of the prevailing
constituent of bones, by which it is rendered more pliant to
the purposes of the animal economy, more obedient to the
laws of life, more ready in short to insinuate itself into the
pores, so as to form the coats of those delicate capillary canals
of which the osseous structure appears to consist?

132            Mr. Way             on a Spathic Carbonate              of Iron.
  There can be little doubt that the deposition of carbonate
of lime had occurred in the crystals simultaneously with that
of carbonate of iron, a circumstance of easy explanation from
the isomorphous relations of iron and lime in their carbonates.
   The simplest method of dissolving up the peroxide of iron
so as to obtain this pure carbonate of iron, appears to be to
digest the powdered mineral in strong hydrochloric acid till
all the black matter is removed, which occurs in a few minutes,
to wash and dry by a heat of 212°.
   The power which carbonate of iron in this state opposes to
the action of acids is well illustrated in another instance, in
which masses of the size of split peas were introduced into
commercial hydrochloric acid diluted with an equal bulk of
water, a state most favourable to the solution of a carbonate.
After digestion for a night, the acid remaining in excess, the
carbonate was found undissolved, the only effect being the
removal in solution of the hydrated peroxide and consequent
disintegration of the mineral.           Some of the carbonate had
undoubtedly dissolved, but the greater part escaped.
   This separation of the constituents of the substance under
examination is a very distinct denial to the supposition that
they exist in a state of combination, and indicates at the same
time a very considerable resistance to external agencies.               It
comes then to be an interesting mineralogical inquiry in what
way the peroxide of iron found                         its
                                            way into the mineral.                                   In

                              of            carbonate        iron,” Dr.         of
Thomson states his belief that the         peroxide  had  originally  ex
isted in the state             of
                          carbonate                 of
                                          the protoxide, but that by

   By the analysis it will be observed that the total amount of
iron as carbonate and peroxide is equivalent to about 45 per
cent. Comparing this with Mushet’s black band (the richest
ore which is worked in England), we have, it is true, no great
preponderance in favour of the spathic carbonate, except in
the purity of the ore. In comparison, however, with the ores
usually employed in this country it possesses great advantages.
   Of 7 analyses of clay iron-stone from the Glasgow fields
the average in iron is 30 per cent.; showing an advantage of
50 per cent. on the product to be obtained from this mineral.
   This, although a vast recommendation, is perhaps the least
that can be urged in favour of this valuable ore.              The ease
with which it would be worked is another subject of consi
derable importance. A simple reduction with carbonaceous
matter is probably              all
                            that would      required, there being little

  On repeating the calculations given at the end of the paper
I have found two or three trifling typographical errors, which
are unworthy of notice; but there is one of another kind which
requires correction, since it is an error in computation and has
considerable effect on the final result. The value of Pa being
24° 51' 10" and that of a' 21° 25' 48", a' must evidently be
3° 25' 22", instead                of 2° 25' 22".                The last              step    of the calcu

to  my explanation          given above,
                                   as                             “il

136                Sir David Brewster on Colour Blindness or
most perfect manner are insensible to certain impressions of
highly attenuated light which are quite perceptible to other
eyes.”    Now it was a very natural conclusion that this insen
sibility might be greater for some colours than for others, and
as lyr. Wollaston had just published his discovery of a similar
phaenomenon in reference to the ear”, and had ascribed it to a
difference in the state of the tympanum,      conceived that an                         I
analogous view might be taken of colour blindness.      Perhaps
Dr. Wollaston was too bold in      ascribing cricket deafness, as
it may be called, to the state of the tympanum, and not to a
defect in the sensorium, and                             I
                                also too bold in pursuing the

ray from the red object is efficacious, and the only effect is the
substitution of a sensation of yellow or green in place of red,
then we might expect that the object would appear brighter,
in so far as a yellow sensation produced by a given number of
red rays should be brighter than a red sensation produced by
the same number.
    After some observations on the foregoing quotation, Prof.
Wartmann proceeds thus: “Plus tard Sir D. Brewster parait
avoir changé d'opinion*. En partant de la supposition que la
choroide est essentielle à la vision, il conjecture que l'invisibi
lité de la couleur rouge chez les Daltoniens est due à ce, que
la rétine elle-même a une teinte bleu, de telle sorte que la                                   lu
mière étant privée de ses rayons rouges par le pouvoir absorb
ant de cette membrane, l'impression colorée sur la choroide
sera dénuée de rouge.”
    Prof. Wartmann is quite mistaken in thinking that I have
changed my opinion; the passage which he quotes as mine is
from an anonymous notice on the subject, and he was not,
therefore, entitled to attach my name to an opinion which I
did not avow.                                               I
                  It is quite true that wrote the anonymous |
notice, but the notice itself, had it been fully quoted, would
 have shown what was my real opinion, as distinguished from
 a conjecture founded upon a possible and expressed supposi
 tion. The passage in the anonymous notice quoted by Prof.
 Wartmann is as follows:– “Dr. Brewster conceives that the
eye is in those cases (of colour blindness) insensible to the co
lour at one end of the spectrum, just as the ear of certain per
sons has been proved by Dr. Wollaston to be insensible to
sounds at one extremity of the scale of musical notes, while it
is perfectly sensible to               all
                             other sounds.” Now this       my opi                  is
         which, though writing anonymously, attach my name;

and      the very next sentence         throw out the conjecture,

my name           while
                 to    it,         he
                             overlooks my real opinion, bearing
my name,       the very sentence which precedes the conjecture.

   But, after all, the conjecture was not       idle one.  During  an

knew that       cases of colour blindness the vitreous humour
                      in

 138            Sir David Brewster on Colour Blindness or
  retina as one which might be admissible as a cause of colour
  blindness; but only on the supposition that the choroid coat
  should prove to be the seat of vision.
     In treating of the various forms of colour blindness, Prof.
  Wartmann considers the greatness of their number as not
 giving support to the constitution of the solar spectrum of equal
 and coincident spectra of the three primitive colours. “C'est ce
 nombre si grand des variétés du Daltonisme qui me semble une
 objection contre la preuve que Sir David Brewster a cru trou
 ver dans cette anomalie pour appuyer sa théorie de trois cou
 leurs élémentaires (Edin. Journ. of Science+, N. S., tom. v.
 p. 206; Bibl. Univ., tom. l. p. 147).              On ne peut pas dire que
 ‘le fait physiologique,      et le principe    d'optique    sur leguel il fonde
 son  analyse     du  spectre   sont   parfaitement      d'accord et se confir
 ment mutuellement.”            What Prof. Wartmann calls my theory
 of three elementary colours is a fact as rigorously demonstrated
 as any physical truth can be ; but if he does not admit it as
 true over the whole length of the spectrum, he cannot avoid,
 if he makes the experiments, admitting it as true over the
 greater part of          it;
                          and this            that
                                              is   all necessary for my pre

   As do not understand how this negative support can be
affected by the great number of varieties of colour blindness,
I  cannot reply to Prof. Wartmann's statement, but shall en                                   I
deavour to explain my own view of the matter.             According
to the doctrine of the    triple spectrum, the red  space  consists of
red, yellow and blue light, the red predominating and the blue
being extremely feeble.        Now the late Mr. Troughton, whose
colour blindness was examined by Sir John Herschel and my
self, on separate occasions, saw this red space, yellow. Hence,
according to my views, he saw a space containing much yellow
and little blue, the red light being as it were absorbed, in conse
quence of the nervous membrane being insensible to             action.                            its
If  this     be
            the case, there must have been        diminution      light   a                            of

140            Sir D. Brewster             on Colour Blindness.
which it misapplies, and as one of the worst examples of
vicious nomenclature. The name was first imposed by Prof.
Prevost of Geneva, and Prof. Wartmann has continued it on
the sole ground that it has for forty years been employed in
oral instruction in the academy of that city.    Dr. Whewell's
name of Idioptcy or Idiopts is clearly inadmissible, and we
cannot speak more favourably of the name Achromatopsie, used
by Purkinje; Akyanoblepsie, used by Goethe; Chromatopseu
dopsy, used by Sommer and Szokalspi; and last and worst of
all, Chromatometablepsie | We have used the word Colour
blindness, because it indicates simply blindness to one or more
 colours”.
   The following is Prof. Wartmann's recapitulation of the
principal results of his able and interesting memoir:-
    1. Daltonism has not been studied by the ancients.
   2. It has been found only in individuals of the white race.
   3. There are very many varieties of the affection, from per
sons who see only black and white to those who in candle
light confound approximating shades of blue and green.
   4. There are more Daltonians than is generally believed.
   5. The female sex furnishes a very small proportion.
   6. In certain cases they may be recognised by external signs.
   7. There are as many Daltonians with blue as with black eyes.
   8. Daltonism is not always hereditary.
   9. It does not always affect the males of the same family.
    10. It does not always commence at birth.
    11. The Daltonians do not judge as we do of complemen
tary colours.
   12. Several of them are not sensible to the least refrangible
raws.
  %.    They see, as we do, the lines in the spectrum disco
vered  by Fraunhofer.
  14. They do not judge as we do of the contrast of colours.
   15. Daltonism does not arise from a vicious conformation of
the eye, or any coloration of the humours or the retina.
   16. We may alter the state of Daltonism by very simple
means.
  17.    Daltonism has        its   origin    in  a    defect    of  the sensorium.

The result of     a comparative trial made with the urine of the white
headed Sea-Eagle, in one instance kept in darkness, in the other
exposed to bright sunshine for many successive days, afforded an
answer in the affirmative.          Whilst the urine of the Sea-Eagle, con
sisting chiefly of lithate of ammonia, kept in the dark, underwent
no change, that exposed to light was materially changed, most of
the lithate of ammonia had disappeared,                   place was supplied by its

the author states that in order to obtain a clear and well-defined
 image of any object on the Daguerreotype plate, he generally found
 it necessary to adjust the focus on the ground glass by another ob.
ject brought considerably nearer to the camera than the object
 whose picture was required.       When this adjustment is made, he
proceeds to apply the principle practically to the taking of portraits.
 He finds that in achromatic object-glasses the focus of photogenic
 action is not coincident with the visual focus; and the distance be.
 tween these two foci varies according to the nature of the combina.
 tion of the glasses, to their different dispersive powers, and to the
 degree of intensity of the light. By attention to these circumstances
 in accurately adjusting the Daguerreotype plate to the situation of
 the focus of the photogenic rays, the author has succeeded in ob
 taining the most perfect delineations of objects *.

at the next change by the growth of a new leg, while those pre
viously reproduced acquired an increase of size.
    The first observation which led the author to believe that true in
sects might possess the power of reproducing lost parts, was that of
a specimen of Phasma in the collection at the British Museum, in
which the right anterior leg had evidently been reproduced.                    He
then instituted a series of experiments on the larva of the Vanessa
zartica, or common nettle butterfly, which belongs to the order
Lepidoptera, and undergoes complete metamorphosis.                  He removed
some of the true legs of the larva, sometimes in their tibial portion,
and sometimes at their base: in the first case, parts similar to those
removed were invariably reproduced in different states of develop
ment, and in the latter, entire new limbs were formed; in some in
stances, at the second change of the larva, when it passed into the
pupa state ; but in two or three instances no reproduction took
place. At first view, this difference in the results might appear to
favour the opinion that this reproduction of limbs depends on the
existence of parts especially adapted to perform this function, and
which, in those experiments that had failed to exhibit the pheno
menon, had been themselves removed. But the author found that
in every instance of the mutilations thus practised, the perfect in
sect possessed a coxa, or basilar part of the limb ; and this was the
case even in those in which a new organ was not reproduced. From
this fact, taken in conjunction with the formation of new entire limbs
in the Iulidae after the removal of every portion of the previous
ones, the author infers that the power of reproduction resides in the
whole of the organized tissues.                                                                is,

duces from his investigations. Slight wounds               the larvae   in insects                 of

   5. “On the Changes of Temperature produced by the Rarefaction
and Condensation of Air.”     By James Prescott Joule, Esq. Com
municated   by  P. M.  Roget, M.D.,  Sec. R.S.
   In order to estimate with greater accuracy than has hitherto been
done the quantities of heat evolved or absorbed during the conden
sation or rarefaction of atmospheric air, the author contrived an
apparatus where both the condensing pump and the receiver were
immersed in a large quantity of water, the changes in the tempe
rature of which were ascertained by a thermometer of extreme sen
sibility. By comparing the amount of force expended in condensing
air in the receiver with the quantity of heat evolved, after deducting
that which was the effect of friction, it was found that a mechanical
force, capable of raising 823 pounds to the height of one foot, must
be applied in the condensation of air, in order to raise the tempe
rature of one pound of water one degree of Fahrenheit's scale.       In
another experiment, when air condensed in one vessel was allowed
to pass into another vessel from which the air had been exhausted,
both vessels being immersed in a large receiver full of water, no
change of temperature took place, no mechanical power having been
developed. The author considers these results as strongly corro
borating the dynamical theory of the nature of heat, in opposition
to that which ascribes to it materiality; but he reserves the further
discussion of this question to a future communication, which he
hopes soon to present to the Royal Society.

common sea sand of the Dublin coasts, and a few microscopic flakes
of mica.
   A singular minute black worm is found in this clay, which may be
worth the attention of naturalists.
 . The clay as dug out does not effervesce with acids, and is insolu
ble in them. It yields no soluble matter to water, and appears to
contain no alkali in any specimens yet examined. I have, however,
reason to think that the less fully decomposed portions of the clay
may contain alkali in a soluble condition, and hence render the ma
terial valuable as a manure.
   Some of the finest portion of the clay washed from the sand, and
dried at a temperature of 212°Fahr., was found by me to have the
following composition: the analysis having been conducted in the
usual way and with the usual precautions, it does not seem necessary
to detail its steps:—
                       Silica. . . . . . . . 67.96
                       Alumina       . . . . 23:20
                       Lime . . . . . . . .   3:23

                                                    99.01
    As no washing completely removes the presence of sand from this
clay, which always feels gritty to a glass rod, and as it contains
comminuted mica, it could not be expected that           analysis should  its
present precisely mineralogical result.

 that the useless discussion of 1818 (when the discrepancy last oc
 curred) will be revived, unless some one will forthwith state the
 reason of the difficulty, I request that you will publish some of the
 conclusions of the paper to which I refer, which will in due time ap
 pear in the work cited : and I hope that the daily papers will give
 additional currency to the same conclusions; and I should recom
 mend that the same thing should be done in the almanacs. The
 rule adopted in this country for finding Easter is that of the Roman
 Catholic Church, as established at what is called the reformation of
 the Calendar by Pope Gregory XIII. in 1582. The authority for
 this rule is contained in the papal brief of March 1st, 1582, in which
 reference is made, for               to all
                             explanations,    the then forthcoming work  to
    the Jesuit Clavius,    whom both the adjustment and explanation
of ofthe Calendar had been entrusted.       The British parliament,                                                         in
adopting the rule       Clavius, made two mistakes
                             of                           the eaglanation                     in
of  that rule. Their explanation       that Easter Sunday  is,the Sunday                               is
after the full moon which comes on         next after the 21st    March,
                                                                    or                                       of

    The two mistakes are as follows:–
        Instead
        1.         “full moon,” they should have said “fourteenth day
                       of

                                           of                  the first.”                              as
That Easter,       wellas  the Passover, was always regulated, not by
                                      as
the full moon, but by the fourteenth day         the moon,        the ut      of                        is   of
most historical notoriety.     And Clavius says that “none but few                                                 a
who fancy themselves sharp-sighted ever imagined that the four
teenth of the moon and the full moon were the same in the Church
of God.”

own system would sometimes cause it to happen that St. Paul's Ca

EFFECTS OF NASCENT OXYGEN ON CERTAIN ORGANIC ALKALIES.
                          BY EUGENE MARCHAND.
    When excess of peroxide of lead is boiled in a solution of sulphate
of cinchonia, quina, morphia, narcotina, strychnia or brucia, and sul
phuric acid is added drop by drop, until a portion of the filtered
liquor, tested with ammonia, potash, or its carbonate, ceases to be
come turbid, there occurs a brisk effervescence of carbonic acid gas,
and the liquor becomes of a deeper colour; if the operation be then
stopped and any free acid which may exist in it be saturated with
litharge, the solution evaporated to dryness, and the mass be treated
with distilled water, and the solution obtained with sulphuretted
hydrogen, which sometimes precipitates a little sulphuret of lead,
and lastly the filtered liquor be evaporated to dryness, very distinct
colouring matters are procured from each organic alkali; these co
louring substances are the following:—
    Cinchonetin ; this is obtained by the process above described from
cinchonia;        its

 a new substance, the opianic acid, previously obtained by MM.

   Strychnia.-This treated like the preceding yields a pulverulent
 mass  of a brownish yellow colour, very slightly soluble in boiling
 water, but imparts to it a dirty yellow colour and a bitter taste; it is
 very slightly soluble in alcohol, but soluble in aether, and also in
  boiling water acidulated with sulphuric acid; and from this the greater
 part precipitates on cooling.
     Potash is the best solvent of this substance; the solution has a
 brown colour, and if only the exact quantity of potash required for
  solution be employed, the solution does not act on syrup of violets.
 When sulphuric acid is added to the solution, so as to give it an acid
 reaction, it becomes turbid, and deposits a yellowish flocky precipi
 tate. The neutralized alkaline solution, when perfectly neutralized,
 does not act upon cupreous or ferruginous salts, but it precipitates
 the salts of lead and silver.
    This substance is worthy of the attention of chemists; the remark
 able manner in which it acts with potash, appearing to saturate it
 perfectly, will perhaps lead to                       its
                                         being considered           new acid.

by decomposing chlorate of barytes by sulphate of magnesia, yielded
by evaporation over sulphuric acid, a saline mass of crystalline la

It was separated from the solution, pressed between folds of blotting
paper, and then perfectly dried over sulphuric acid; it fused at 120°
Fahr.; and at about 248°Fahr, it begins to lose water, oxygen and
chlorine.    When the heat is continued there is obtained a mixture

    Protochlorate of Manganese.—This compound could not be ob
tained in the solid form. The colourless solution obtained by de
composing chlorate of barytes with protosulphate of manganese,
decomposes by evaporation over sulphuric acid, at a certain degree
 of concentration, into chlorine, oxygen and hydrated peroxide of
 manganese; the author therefore merely states the properties of a
 dilute solution: it suffers no change by ebullition; sulphuric acid
 diluted gives it a deep red colour; there being formed sulphate of
manganese at the expense of the oxygen of the chloric acid.         If a
small quantity of solution of protoxide of manganese be added to an
excess of concentrated sulphuric acid, a brown crystalline precipitate
is formed, which is an intimate mixture of peroxide of manganese
and sulphate of the protoxide, insoluble in concentrated sulphuric
acid.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Mai 1844.
  PREPARATION OF PROTOXIDE OF GOLD.                  BY M. L. FIGUIER.
    The author states that the substance which Berzelius describes as
protoxide of gold is a mixture of the oxide and metallic gold; and
he mentions the following processes for procuring the real pro
toxide:—
    1st. Let a solution of chloride of gold be evaporated to dryness to
deprive it of acidity; to the residue dissolved in water add a solution

 158                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous                                 Articles.
of protonitrate of mercury, and a deep violet precipitate of protoxide
of gold is formed; sometimes the precipitate does not separate, and
the oxide remains apparently dissolved; but by heat, the precipitate
separates immediately; in this operation it is essential not to use an
excess of the mercurial salt, for it would produce protochloride, on
account of the presence of the hydrochloric acid which accompanies
 the reaction; it is sufficient not to precipitate the whole of the gold,
 and to stop while the solution remains slightly coloured yellow with
 the undecomposed chloride of gold.
    2nd. The decomposition of protochloride of gold by potash is a
good method of preparing protoxide of gold, but there are precautions
which are indispensable to be observed in order to obtain a pure pro
duct; evaporate a solution of chloride of gold to dryness, and heat
 the residue on a sand-bath, the temperature of which is determined
by a thermometer; the mass is to be continually agitated till it as
sumes a very bright canary-yellow colour, taking care that the tem
perature does not exceed 302°Fahr. ; at a higher temperature the
protochloride loses the greater part of             chlorine.       its
                  then poured          the mixture,      dark violet precipitate

protoxide that this method may also be used.       The carbonate and
bicarbonate of potash produce the same effects.
   6th. Vegetable infusions, treated with chloride of gold and excess
of a fixed alkali, produce, at a moderately high temperature, or still
better by contact of some hours' duration, an abundant precipitate
of protoxide of gold, retaining, however, a little organic matter.
   7th. The acetate, citrate and the tartrate of potash, with an excess
of potash, form under the same circumstances protoxide of gold.
   The preceding facts seem to determine pretty clearly the action
of organic salts upon chloride of gold : when an alkali is present,
protoxide is precipitated; but if the salts be neutral or acid, metallic
gold is thrown down: these facts are proved by a very simple ex
periment; when solution of gold is boiled, tartaric acid or neutral
tartrate of potash, a precipitate of gold is formed; but if the liquor
be filtered which contains some undecomposed chloride of gold, and
potash be added in excess, a blackish-violet precipitate of protoxide
is immediately obtained.—Ann. de Ch. et de Ph., Juillet 1844.

compounds of gold will be given in a future number.—ED. P. M.]

    IT      is well known that the word gas was first introduced into
           chemistry by Van Helmont in his Treatise de Flatibus.
    Junker, whose Conspectus Chemiae Theoretico Practicae was
    published in 1744, conjectures that Van Helmont's word gas
    was merely the German word gischt, fermentation, in a Latin
    dress, and this conjecture seems as probable as any.
        Boyle was the first chemist who attempted to make gas ar
    tificially, and who showed that thus prepared it possessed the
    mechanical properties of common air. The gas which he ex
    amined was hydrogen, obtained by pouring dilute sulphuric
    acid on iron filings.
        Hales, in 1726, proved by experiment that many animal
    and vegetable substances, when heated sufficiently, give out an
    air which possesses the mechanical properties of common air,
    and which therefore he considered as not differing in               pro          its
    perties from common air. That hydrogen gas was combustible
    was known      atleast    early  asthe beginning
                                             as           the last century,

cherry coal, splint coal and cannel coal. Of these the cannel
coal, or parrot coal as it is called here, yields the best gas;
the caking coal, or Newcastle coal, yields the worst, and the
cherry and splint, though very different in their appearance,
yield an intermediate gas, the quality of which, whether from
cherry or splint coal, is nearly the same.
   There are three varieties of cannel coal in the neighbour
hood of Glasgow, named from the localities where they occur,
Skaterigg, Lesmahagow and Monkland.
   The specific gravity of these varieties of coal is as follows:–

   It appears from this table that Newcastle coal contains the
most carbon, and Monkland cannel coal the least; while can
nel coal contains the most oxygen and Newcastle coal the least;
Newcastle coal contains the least hydrogen and cannel coal
the most. Now cannel coal yields the best and Newcastle coal
the worst gas. This need excite no surprise; carbon not being
volatile, it is obvious that if coal contained nothing but carbon
it would yield no gas at all. Coal-gas is a mixture of four
different gases, most of which are compounds; two are com
pounds of carbon and hydrogen, one of carbon and oxygen,
and the fourth is pure hydrogen. There is no difficulty in con
ceiving the formation of the gaseous compounds of carbon and
hydrogen, but it is not so easy to explain the occurrence of car
bonic oxide and hydrogen. These two gases are never entirely
wanting; at least I have analysed above forty specimens of coal
gas from different kinds of coal and from different gas-works
without ever failing to find them.         I think it probable that
they make their appearance towards the end of the process of
heating the coal. It is well known that the longer the process
of gas making is continued, and the higher the temperature at
which the gas is produced, the worse is the gas, and of course
the more hydrogen it contains.         Is it not possible that coal
may contain water; that this water can only be extricated at
a high temperature; that                  its
                                 oxygen combines with carbon and
forms carbonic     oxide, while the hydrogen makes        escape                         its              in
the  gaseous   state?      this supposition
                                If           were true, there ought
to be constant ratio between the volume of carbonic oxide
        a
and hydrogen         the coal-gas; but this not being the case,

                     covered over with     fine smooth, shining black coat

 in my laboratory, which may be about a furlong from the gas
 works; now the average quantity in the Greenock gas was
 10}, and in the Glasgow 12}.
    The highest specific gravity of the Glasgow gas   was 0.582,
 and the lowest  0-463;  the average  was 0.502.
    The quantity of olefiant gas in Glasgow gas varied from
 11-77 per cent. to 1783 per cent; the mean quantity was
 13:52 per cent.
    I got gas made at Greenock with as much care as possible
 from each of the three varieties of cannel coal found in the
 neighbourhood of Glasgow, namely Skaterigg, Lesmahagow
and Monkland: the specific gravities of these gases were,
                     Skaterigg . . 0.497
                     Lesmahagow 0:560
                     Monkland .    . 0-622
  The olefiant gas per cent, contained in each was as follows:—
                     Glasgow . . . 13:52
                     Skaterigg . . 14.15
                     Lesmahagow. 16.66
                     Monkland . . 22:15
    Mr. Ritchie, the manager of the Greenock gas-works, who
prepared these gases, told me that he thought rather too much
heat had been applied to the Lesmahagow coal, which in his
opinion would have somewhat deteriorated the Lesmahagow
coal-gas.
    The mean quantity of carburetted hydrogen gas in the
Glasgow coal-gas was 60.6 per cent; the smallest quantity was
47-33, and the largest 79.77: the quantity of this gas in the
gases from cannel coal was as follows:–
                     Skaterigg . . 66'49
                    Lesmahagow. 59.94
                     Monkland   . . 48°77
    The goodness of these gases is in the order of naming them.
It would appear from this, that the smaller the proportion of
carburetted hydrogen the better is the gas; the reason is that
the olefiant gas increases as the carburetted hydrogen dimi
nishes.
   The average quantity of carbonic oxide in Glasgow gas was
12 per cent, the smallest quantity was 6'34 per cent, and the
greatest quantity 15 per cent.: the quantity of this gas in the
three gases from cannel coal was as follows:–
                     Skaterigg . . 7-07
                     Lesmahagow. 12:00

                  understand how it is possible that the violet
ray or any other ray can cause leaves to evolve pure oxygen.
It has happened to me in certain investigations in vegetable
physiology to make more than 200 analyses of gas from vege
table leaves.   They have never emitted pure oxygen, but a
mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, and very often as much as
fifty per cent. of the former gas. This result is the same as
has been obtained over and over again for more than fifty
years. M. Saussure, Dr. Daubeny, and             other competent   all
writers are     agreement
                  in       upon this point.

I   am therefore obliged                   to
                                    infer that there must           some                   be

of  the area, and the photographic power              increased      the         is               in
reverse   proportion.
    With the same aperture, the two lenses define nearly            well                             as
 aswhen used singly: but, the light gained being very consider

               Electrolysis   of Secondary      Compounds.             175
able, the aperture admits of contraction; and, by reducing it
to one-tenth of the compound focus, an image may be obtained
of exquisite fineness.
   Two lenses of 24 inches focus (3 inches diameter), placed 7
inches apart, have the same conjugate foci as a single lens of
13 inches; and, with an aperture of 1:3 inch, the picture is
beautifully defined: over 15° it is of a very high and uniform
quality under a magnifier; and within 20°, there is little differ
ence perceptible to the naked eye.
    This combination is in strict accordance with the periscopic
principle of Dr. Wollaston; and also, with that of the Cod
dington lens;      Iam not aware that it has yet been applied to
the camera obscura, but it seems to be not less applicable to
that instrument than to microscopes.
    It might, perhaps, be improved by filling the space between
the lenses with a blue coloured medium, of the same refrac
tion as the glass; the focus would be shortened and the pho
tographic power increased; and the photographic rays asso
ciated with the red and yellow end of the spectrum being
absorbed, would cease to interfere with the unity of the focus.
     Iavail myself of this opportunity to correct a mistake in an
article on “the Calotype” in the Philosophical Magazine of
May 1844. At p. 326, § 17, line second from the foot of the
page, for “a pint of water” read half a pint (ten ounces).

THE  authors of the following paper having agreed to work
  together upon the subject of the electrolysis of secondary
compounds as opened by one of them, in two letters addressed
to Dr. Faraday, and honoured with a place in the Philosophi

results, which probably will not be without interest to the
Royal Society, and which they have now the honour to com

oxide, with         equivalent proportion

electrode, one particle of each ion would have passed the cen
tral line, one equivalent would thus be transferred, whilst two
had been disengaged, as in fig. 3.
   In the instances above referred to, the transfer of one quarter
of an equivalent represented half of an equivalent of the hy
drates respectively electrolysed.     Little stress however need
be laid upon this correction, inasmuch as we shall presently
show that the hypothesis upon which it is founded, although
generally received, is itself destitute of foundation,
   1. Our first object was to ascertain more clearly than had
yet been done, the influence of water in the aqueous solution
of an electrolyte, by comparison with the results of the elec
trolysis of the same compound when in the state of igneous
fusion.    It had been already determined, that with regard to
the chlorides no difference occurred, and that the amounts of
chlorine evolved in the same circuit from fused chloride of
lead”, and from dissolved chloride of sodium and muriate of
ammonia, were the same+.         In the last case, ammonia and
hydrogen were evolved at the platinode in equivalent propor
tions to the chlorine at the zincode. Here a compound cation
 (NHA) was separated from an elementary anion.
   When nitrate of silver in solution is subjected to electrolysis,
the simple cation, silver, separates from the compound anion
 (NO), and upon substituting the salt in a state of fusion, for
the solution, we obtained the same result. No gas was evolved,
but crystallized metallic silver was deposited upon a silver pla
tinode, which gradually increased in length, as it was slowly
withdrawn from the liquid salt, just as in the analogous expe
riment with fused chloride of silver, devised by Dr. Faraday.
Nitrous fumes were at the same time given off from the plati
num zincode in abundance.          From these experiments it is
evident that neither the grouping of a compound cation, nor
of a compound anion, is necessarily altered by water in the
transit to their respective electrodes.
   2. We now turned our attention to that most interesting
group of salts, the phosphates, which has been so ably discussed
by Prof. Graham f: not without hopes of confirming by elec
trolysis the beautiful theory of their constitution, which he has
derived from considerations purely chemical. The double dia
phragm cell, which we chiefly employed in these experiments,
is represented in the annexed woodcut.

  The liquid from the zincode cell     was carefully neutralized
with nitric acid,  and then   gave a  copious   yellow precipitate
with nitrate of silver, soluble in nitric acid, and in ammonia,
the well-known characters of the tribasic phosphate of silver
(3AgO, P, O.). The solution in the platinode cell had be
come much more alkaline than at first, but when neutralized
with nitric acid, gave a similar yellow precipitate with nitrate
of silver. There could be no doubt therefore that tritory
phosphion (or the radicle of the tritohydrate of phosphoric
acid) had travelled to the zincode. The experiment was more
than once repeated with unvarying results.
   (b.) A solution of tribasic phosphate of soda (3NaO, P, O...)
(sub-phosphate) was substituted in the same arrangement for
the rhombic phosphate, and, after the action of the battery, on
neutralizing the liquid in the zincode cell, a similar copious
yellow precipitate was obtained from nitrate of silver.
   (c.) To complete the series of tribasic phosphates in which
different bases are substituted for each other, a solution of the

                                              Hö

lysis, the zincode cell being charged with solution of soda ;
the solution in the zincode cell became acid to the test of       lit
mus, and produced an abundant yellow precipitate in solution
of nitrate of silver; proving that it was the tribasic acid which
had travelled as before.
   (d.) A similar arrangement was made with a solution of          di
basic phosphate (pyrophosphate) of soda (2NaO, P, O.).            Hy
drogen and oxygen in equivalent proportions were respectively
given out at the platinode and zincode, and the process was
carried on to the same extent as before.      The solution at the
zincode after electrolysis was neutralized by nitric acid. When
tested with solution of nitrate of silver, a copious white preci
pitate was formed, indicating that in this case deutoryphosphion
(or the radicle of the deuto-hydrate of phosphoric acid) had
been transferred to the zincode.
   (e.) A solution of monobasic phosphate (NaO, P, O.) (me
taphosphate) was subjected to electrolysis under the same cir
cumstances.      The solution in the zincode cell was now found
to be   strongly acid instead of alkaline; when added to a solu
tion of albumen it immediately coagulated     it; and with nitrate
of  silver and nitrate   of barytait  produced the characteristic
gelatinous white precipitates, which are distinctive      the mo

182              Prof. Daniell and Dr. Miller on the
electrolysis of organic compounds, and which we hope to make
the subject of future communications, induce us to abstain at
present from extending this part of our inquiry to the organic
acids.
   4. An inquiry of considerable interest now claims our at
tention, viz. the electrolysis of salts, whose acids, having the
same elementary    radicle as some of those which have been al
ready examined, are in an inferior degree of oxygenation :
such are the arsenites and sulphites.
   (g.) A solution of arsenite of potassa (KO, As2O3) was care
fully prepared (by dissolving single equivalents of arsenious
.#    and bicarbonate of potassa in boiling water), and placed
in the platinode cell of the diaphragm apparatus; the con
necting cell and the zincode cell were both charged with solu
tion of potassa.    During the electrolysis oxygen was given off
at the zincode,  but an equivalent of hydrogen was not obtained
        platinode,  the electrode being covered with metallic
at the
arsenic, which was deposited in               .#
                                           abundance as speedily
to render the liquid opake; there was no smell of arseniuretted
hydrogen.     This diffusion of the metal reduced by secondary
action, throughout the solution, contrasts well with the com
pact manner in which metals are deposited, which, like copper
from the neutral sulphate, are thrown down by direct voltaic
action. The zincode solution was exactly neutralized by acetic
acid; after which a yellow precipitate of the arsenite of silver
was produced on adding nitrate of silver.
   In this case, as in that of the arseniate just described (3.f),
free oxygen was evolved, but the corresponding hydrogen ari
sing from the secondary action of the potassium at the other
electrode was taken up in the reduction of the arsenious acid
in contact with which it was evolved. No such reduction of
the arsenic acid was effected.
   It might have been anticipated that the oxygen in travelling
with the arsenious acid to the zincode would have combined
with   it,
         and formed      portion
                           a        arsenic acid; but
                                         of               such re
                                                               no
sult took place:   and    must    remarked,
                                        be    that two  equivalents
                           of it
of  oxygen instead       one would       required fully
                                              be            oxidateto
the whole. We must, therefore, conclude that As, Os                      +   O
constitute what       we
                      may for the present distinguish           sub
                                                                    as

ent states of oxygenation.         It has been already stated, that in
the electrolysis of the former, carbonic acid and oxygen were
found to be given off at the zincode in equivalent proportions
to the alkali and hydrogen at the platinode; proving those
salts to be oxy-carbions of the respective metals”.                When
oxalate of ammonia was treated in the same way, carbonic
acid alone was evolved at the zincode, and ammonia with hy
drogen at the platinode*. Here the owalion (or sub-oxycar
bion) contains the elements of two equivalents of carbonic acid
(C. Os + O.) = 2 (CO2). In numerous repetitions which we
now made of these experiments, we found that although in the
electrolysis of oxalate of ammonia (C., Os +O) was always ex
actly evolved, yet that it was not invariably in the form of car
bonic acid, but in different proportions of oxalic acid with free
oxygen and carbonic acid. It was thus proved that the burn
ing of the oxalic acid into carbonic acid by             associated oxy
                                                                    its

 phuric acid upon the sulphite                    in

 salt with which it was in contact, by which hyposulphurous

“that one equivalent of the yellow ferrocyanate is decomposed,
the free potash travels one way, and the hydroferrocyanic acid
the other. The oxygen unites with the hydrogen of the acid
and sets ferrocyanogen at liberty; this again unites with an
equivalent of the ferrocyanuret of potassium to form the ferro
sesquicyanuret.”     It is evident from this, that this gentleman
entertains a very different notion of the steps of the electro
lysis to that which we feel justified in supporting, and that
therefore he has failed to place it in the point of view to which
we propose to adhere.
    (l.) We commenced our inquiry by carefully repeating Mr.
Smee's experiment in a diaphragm cell, charged throughout
with a strong solution of the yellow ferrocyanide of potassium.
A voltameter was included in the circuit, and the power of
twenty cells of the small constant battery was employed. Gas
was evolved at the platinode, which was tested and found to
be pure hydrogen; it was in equivalent proportion to the gases
in the voltameter. No gas was at first evolved at the zincode,
but the solution in that cell became gradually red, particu
larly at the surface. When 4 inches of hydrogen had been
collected at the platinode a slight disengagement of gas com
menced at the zincode, which continued, and proved to be
oxygen, and was in the proportion of one-third of the gas from
the platinode.     After sixteen cubic inches had been collected
from the platinode, we stopped the experiment and examined
the results.
    The platinode solution was much paler than before, and
was alkaline.     The zincode solution was deep green and acid,
and the zincode plate was covered with a slight film of Prussian
blue.     Crystals of the red ferrocyanide separated from the
zincode solution by spontaneous evaporation, and when the
evaporation was complete, a radiated mass of a purplish-brown
colour was obtained: on solution a small quantity of Prussian
blue remained, and the solution had lost        acid reagency. The
                                                       its
addition    of acetate  of  lead  to the solution produced but            a
scanty precipitate, proving the quantity               of
                                                 yellow ferrocyanide
remaining    in
             it   to   be but small.
    The explanation     of these results         is,
                                              we think, sufficiently
obvious.      Ferrocyanogen was doubtless transferred               to
                                                                  the

with  a  portion of  the ferrocyanide      form the subsesquiferro

                                                   the abstraction        of
a  portion  of the potassium passing over       the platinode, where

                Electrolysis  of Secondary   Compounds.          187
results of the following arrangement.           The zincode cell was
filled with a dilute solution of potassa, and the connecting cell
with the same.        The platinode cell was charged with a strong
solution of the red ferrocyanide.        This solution previously to
the commencement of the          experiment    gave no blue solution
with perchloride of iron.        The  liquid in the zincode and con
necting cells speedily became yellow, and after a short time
the solution in the platinode cell also became yellow.        All the
 solutions were now found to contain the yellow ferrocyanide.
 Thus it was quite clear that no such compound as ferridcya
nogen travelled from the red salt when exposed to electrolysis,
 but that the red salt was converted into the yellow by the abs
 traction of ferrocyanogen from the platinode, which ferrocya
 nogen being transferred to the zincode, there formed with the
 potassium presented to it by electrolysis the same yellow ferro
 cyanide.
     In order to extend further our knowledge of the electrolysis
 of this class of secondary compounds, the following experi
 ments were made:–
      (p.) A diaphragm apparatus was charged with a strong so
 lution of cyanide of potassium (K, Cy) in the platinode cell,
 and a solution of potassa in the zincode and connecting cells.
  The arrangement conducted well; gas was given off from
 both electrodes, and cyanide of potassium formed in abun
 dance in the zincode cell.         Hydrogen must therefore have
 been    given  off at the platinode  by the oxidation of the potas
  sium    evolved,  and   oxygen  at the zincode by the deoxidation
  of  potassa  under the influence of the current in the formation
  of the cyanide of potassium.
      (q.) The apparatus was charged throughout with solution
  of cyanide of potassium, and subjected to the current. Gas
  was given off as before at the platinode; but at first none from
  the zincode. The liquid in the zincode cell gradually became
  of a deep brown colour, and the electrode itself was coated
  with a deep brown matter, which was easily washed off.           In
  the latter part of the operation gas was also evolved in small
  quantity at the zincode. The solution smelled strongly of
  hydrocyanic acid, of which, by the proper tests, it was found
  to contain a considerable quantity. There can be no doubt
  that the brown matter which was abundantly formed was
  paracyanogen, which is soluble in the alkaline solution of the
  cyanide of potassium, and which must have been produced
   either by the spontaneous decomposition of the hydrocyanic
   acid, or in a way something analogous to the formation of the
   red ferrocyanide of potassium from the yellow by the absorp
   tion of an additional quantity of ferrocyanogen.

and when 54 cubic inches of gas had been collected from the
platinode and 1} cubic inch from the zincode it ceased.
There was a copious orange-coloured deposit in the zincode
cell and upon the plate which interrupted the progress of the
electrolysis; no particular odour was perceptible in either of
the cells. The liquid filtered from the zincode became turbid
by exposure to the air, and deposited more of the yellow com
pound.     The clear liquid was again subjected to the current,
which it transmitted readily, and with the same phaenomena
as before.    There could be little doubt that sulphocyanogen
was the anion transferred in this experiment.          This part of
our   subject still presents a  tempting    field for investigation,
from which however we were for a time diverted by an im
portant class of facts which next fell under our observation;
we have however since returned to the study, and are at pre
sent engaged in researches upon the cobaltocyanides, and
other double cyanides, the results of which we hope ere long
to lay before the Society.

XXVIII.        New Properlies               of Surfaces of the Second Degree.

     GENTLEMEN,
rTH    E following extracts from a paper lately read before the
       Philosophical Society of Dublin may perhaps interest
some of your readers. The theorems which I announce are,
I believe, perfectly new; and some of them will be found, I
think, to possess considerable geometrical elegance.
   Being given two ellipsoids, reciprocal to each other (their
common centre being the origin of transformation),              de                        let   us
scribe the focal conics    one    of         of
                                  them, the axes     which we may           of
call  a,   b,
           c. Then     their planes describe the conics reciprocal
                            in
to them. On these new conics         two cylinderslet  constructed               be
            generatrices  perpendicular           planes

their bases lie. Those cylinders may          called the cyclic cy

                   Salts       of Meconic and           Komenic Acids.                             195
     The salt employed in these determinations was made at five
different times. The compound is evidently a double salt,
consisting of meconate of iron and meconate of ammonia.
The discrepancies in the determinations are probably owing
to the circumstance that one of the constituent salts is more
soluble in the wash-water than the other.
       Iron Salt from Ethereal Solution of Meconic Acid.
   A cold ethereal solution of meconic acid was made by agita
ting the acid, in the state of fine powder, in a stopped bottle
with anhydrous aether. A considerable quantity of aether
  must be employed, as the meconic acid is but very slightly so
 luble in that liquid. The saturated solution was then filtered
  into a second bottle, containing an ethereal solution of per
 chloride of iron.       This was made by dissolving neutral per
  chloride of iron, which had previously been
  to  dryness,    in anhydrous    aether.    When   mixed,
                                                              evaporated
                                                               the two       #.                    li
 quids became of a deep red colour, and in a few minutes a
 quantity of reddish-brown flocks precipitated.              These were
 collected on a filter and washed with aether till any adhering
 chloride of iron was removed.           When dried they formed a
 reddish-brown       powder.    This can only be obtained by the
 use of   anhydrous    aether;  if it contains any water, no precipi
 tate  falls, and the salt is condensed in blood-red drops on the
 sides of the bottle.      The presence of alcohol is equally ob
jectionable.       After the salt has been dried it becomes much
 less soluble than before.       It dissolves pretty readily in cold
 water and     alcohol,  but more readily in hot water, and the ad
dition of a little acid greatly increases         solubility. The co
                                                                 its

     The salt employed in     these determinations was prepared at
three or four different       times;    but though the results agree
pretty closely, I have not been able to fix upon a probable
formula for the salt.
     When meconic acid is agitated in the cold with freshly pre
cipitated peroxide of iron no effect is produced, and if a slight
heat is applied, only a very partial combination is effected.
If   the heat is increased, though much under 212°F., a large
portion of the peroxide is dissolved by the acid; but if the
compound is examined, much of the iron has been reduced to
the state of protoxide.        If the liquid is filtered, it deposits on
cooling a quantity of a reddish powder, which consists of me
conic acid in combination with a mixture of peroxide and pro
 toxide of iron; sometimes the oxide amounts to as much as
 34 per cent.
                              Komenic Acid.
     This acid  is easily prepared by boiling meconate of lime in
 a great excess of strong muriatic acid.            This removes almost
 the whole of the base, and converts the mecomic into the             ko
 menic acid. When the solution cools the impure acid is de
 posited in hard reddish coloured crystals. The best way of
 purifying the komenic acid is to dissolve it with the assistance
 of heat in a slight excess of a concentrated solution of either
 potash or soda, and to filter the liquid while hot. This re
  moves any portion of lime which the komenic acid may still
 have retained. On the cooling of the solution the komenate
 of potash crystallizes in white mammillated masses. These
  should be washed with a little cold water till the highly
  coloured mother liquor is entirely removed. The salt is then
  easily decomposed by boiling it with an excess of pure muri
  atic acid, from which the komenic acid may be freed by two
  or three crystallizations. Komenic acid, even when pure, has
  usually a slight shade of reddish-yellow. This may be almost
  entirely removed by digesting the acid with purified animal
  charcoal.    When heated on platinum foil it does not leave
  any residue.

   This salt therefore is bibasic with 2 atoms water, and its
formula is C, H, O,4-2 PbO4-2aq=KO +2 PbO +2aq.
   The same salt is also formed when komenate of ammonia
is dropt into a solution of acetate of lead.  Komenic acid ap
pears therefore to form only one lead salt.         This result is
rather unexpected, as when komenic acid is neutralized with
ammonia it forms a second silver salt.

monia was also analysed.

               course of some experiments I had recently occasion
     INtotheobserve that some of the most common vegetable sub
    stances reduce the persalts of iron with very great facility. A
    quantity of common meadow grass was immersed in a tole
     rably dilute cold solution of persulphate of iron.               In the
     course of half an     hour,  when tested with red   prussiate    of pot
     ash, the liquid gave a deep blue precipitate, indicating the
     formation of a considerable quantity of protosulphate of iron.
     After three days the solution was again tested, when the iron
     was found to have been completely reduced to the state of
     protoxide.     Several other kinds of green vegetable matters,
     such as   twigs   of trees and shrubs, produced similar results;
     as did   meadow-hay,      chips of wood and sawdust.         Peat and
     wood charcoal, of                   all

   The sample of Matico which I received consisted of the
leaves of the plant, which were of various sizes, from two to
eight inches long, and appeared to have been dried, as they
could easily be rubbed to powder between the hands. It is
indeed stated by Dr. Martius, that the Indians dry the leaves
over a fire, taking care not to allow them to be touched by
the flame or burnt. Another sample which I lately procured
had the same appearance, but contained, mixed up with the
leaves, a considerable quantity of the flowering twigs and
woody stems of the plant. The leaves and twigs were com
pressed together and flattened into a cake.
    The botanical history of the Matico appears to be but im
perfectly known; and there exists a difference of opinion even
as to the class of plants from which it is derived; Dr. Mar

the Phlomis tribe, while in the Flora Peruviana it is described
as a Piper.     By immersing a specimen of the plant, which
seemed    tolerably  perfect, in warm water, I was able to exa
mine it with considerable accuracy, and certainly               charac            its
ters appear very unlike those which belong                the Phlomis  to
family.    The stems are woody, round and pubescent; the
leaves sessile, acuminato-lanceolate, rugose and crenate, their
upper surface       of

Upon evaporating the filtered alcoholic solution, a yellowish
 brown extractive matter, maticine, remained. It had a dis
 agreeable smell and exceedingly bitter taste, like aloes, which
 remained a long time on the palate; it attracted moisture
 from the atmosphere, dissolved readily in alcohol and in water,
 but was not acted on by aether: heated on platinum foil it be
 came brown, swelled up without decrepitation, and left a
 bulky charcoal.      Its solution in water was not affected by
 chloride of platinum, but gave a yellow precipitate with solu
 tion of potash, and also with ammonia: chloride of barium
 did not alter its colour; tinct. ferri muriat. rendered it of a
 deep rich carmine colour, but did not form a precipitate.
    Experiment 6.—A tincture was made by macerating half an
ounce of the leaves, reduced to a coarse powder, with 4 fluid
ounces of alcohol of 84*.        In half an hour the liquid had a
light green colour; after macerating for six days the filtered
tincture had a fine brownish-green colour, and the specific gra
vity 0-860. It possessed in perfection the aromatic astringent
taste of the leaves; water made it muddy but occasioned no
precipitate; tinct. ferri muriat. gave a copious brown black,
and acetate of lead a greenish yellow precipitate ; solution of
potash rendered          colour deep orange, and threw down
                                          its                                        a

      the Number of the Philosophical Magazine published in
IN    November 1843, the author proposed a new method of
deducing theorems relating to the right line and circle from
theorems generally known.        The object of the present notice
is merely to show that                    all
                               the theorems      deduced indicate             so
new properties             of
                     the conic sections.

         GENTLEMEN,
               my passage from Ostend to London, on the
DURING morning of the 20th of July, at about an hour before
sunrise, I had an opportunity of witnessing a meteorological
phaenomenon,     viz, a waterspout, which is rarely met with in
these latitudes.     The vessel lay on her usual course (about
W. N.W.), Ostend being about fifteen miles in an opposite
direction, the wind, a slight breeze, being dead ahead.
   A dense mass of clouds had been forming in the north-east
ern portion of the horizon, and from the rapid manner in which
it increased, and from       course not corresponding with that

  1843.        THEFossil Remains of Star-fishes of the Order Ophiuridae,
found in Britain.”       By Prof. Edward Forbes.
    After enumerating the several Ophiuridae recorded as British fos
sils, the author describes four new species, viz. 1. Ophioderma tenui
brachiata, and 2. Ophiura Murravii, discovered by Dr. Murray in the
lias near Scarborough; 3. Amphiura Pratti, discovered by Mr. Pratt
in the Oxford clay; and 4. Ophiura serrata, communicated by Mr.
 Tennant, from the chalk. The animals of this order appear to have
 commenced their existence in the earliest periods of organic life, and
 to have continued to the present day without any great modifications
 of form, of family or generic value. They seem at present to be much
 more numerous than at any former period. None of the fossil spe
 cies is identical with the existing.

stone.     The author then describes the sections on the east side of
the    Berwyns,  and the section on the Ceiriog and the Dee, which
connect the    part of the protozoic group, which is the exact equiva
lent of the Caradoc sandstone, with the Denbigh flagstone, which
represents the upper Silurian rocks of Mr. Murchison.            After dis
cussing the sections in detail he draws the following conclusions:—
 1. The base of the fossiliferous system is unknown, for beds (occa
 sionally alternating with contemporaneous porphyries) of great thick
mess occasionally present fossil bands with Asaphus Buchii, &c.
 These are below the level of the limestone seen in the Arrenig sec
 tion. 2. That the limestones near Bala (three of which are on the
 line of section, and one at a still lower level) contain fossils which
 point to a lower level than the Caradoc sandstone, and rather con
 form, especially in the lower beds, to the character of the Llandeilo
 flagstone. 3. That the higher part of the section on the Ceiriog
 conforms to the best types of the Caradoc sandstone, and passes into
 the system of the Denbigh flags.         4. That the lower Silurian beds
 in Westmoreland do not conform to the above type : they may be
 compared with the upper part of the Ceiriog section, and perhaps
 with the highest part of the Arrenig section; but they admit of no
 comparison with the lower and by far the thicker part of the proto
 zoic group of North Wales.       Lastly, the author, as in a former paper,
 divides the   upper  Silurian rocks of Denbighshire, &c. into three pri
 mary divisions or groups. The complicated Llangollen sections he
 puts entirely in the lowest of the three divisions.       He confirms his
 former views by some new details and general remarks, accompanied
 by lists of fossils.
     Dec. 13, 1843.—The following papers were read:—
      1. “Notes respecting the Coal Measures, Limestone, and Gypsi
 ferous Strata of the Island of Cape Breton.”        By Mr. R. Brown.
     The author gives the details of certain sections in the coal-fields
 of Cape Breton, confirmatory of Mr. Lyell’s views of the relative age
  of the gypsum and other strata in that island”.
      2. “On the lower Carboniferous Rocks or Gypsiferous Formation
  of Nova Scotia.” By Mr. J. W. Dawson of Pictou, Nova Scotia.
     The coal formation of the eastern part of Nova Scotia consists of
  a  great thickness of sandstones, shales and conglomerates of various
  reddish and gray colours. The lower part of the series is distin
  guished by the presence of limestones with marine shells and gyp
  sum. In this paper the author examines the structure and relations
  of the lower or gypsiferous formation, prefacing it with a notice of
  the general disposition of the rocks of the carboniferous system in
  the region extending along the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
  from Tatmagouche to Antigonish Harbour. The gypsiferous forma
  tion is described as met with at East River, Merigonish, Antigonish,
  and Shubenacardie.       The results of Mr. Dawson's inquiries confirm
  the views advanced by Mr. Lyell in his papers on the geology of
   Nova Scotia”.

     The concretions described are more or less spheroidal, fusiform
 and cylindrical, many of them amorphous masses of a fine-grained,
 compact, dark brown ferruginous claystone.         Their surfaces are
 smooth, often polished, and they sometimes include organic remains.
 Prof. Henslow regards them as of coprolitic origin.       Resembling
 them are certain silicified masses, which prove to be the petro-tym
 panic bones of extinct Cetacea; and Prof. Owen has determined that
 Prof. Henslow's specimens belonged to no less than four distinct spe
 cies of whales of the genus Balana.
    Jan. 3, 1844.—The following papers were read:—
    1. “On the occurrence of the genus Physeter (or sperm whale) in
the Red Crag of Felixstow.” By Mr. Charlesworth.
    In the collection of Mr. Brown of Stanway, is a remarkable fos
sil, which Prof. Owen proved to be the tooth of a cachalot, and in
the Report of the British Association for 1842 states to have been
procured from the diluvium of Essex.        Mr. Charlesworth, having
examined the specimen in question, considers it a genuine crag fossil
from the same deposit with the Cetacean remains, described by Prof.
Henslow at a previous meeting, as just noticed.
    2. “On a Fossil Forest in the Parkfield Colliery, near Wolver
hampton.” By Mr. H. Beckett.
    The author announces the discovery of a remarkable assemblage
of stumps of fossil trees in the Parkfield Colliery,      upright and                  all
evidently     situ. There are two fossil forests, one above the other.

admit of a short notice.
  Jan. 17.—The following papers were read:—
   1. “On Fossil Crustaceans from Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight.”
By Prof. Bell.
  The fossils described in this paper were preserved in the lower
greensand, and belong to the family of Astacidae, probably to the
genus Astacus. They are distinct from any known recent or fossil
species.
     2.   “On    the occurrence of Phosphorite in Estremadura.”             By
Prof.   Daubeny     and  Capt.  Widdrington.
    The phosphorite rock, the extent of which had been greatly ex
aggerated by Spanish writers, is situated at a short distance from
Logrosan, a village of Estremadura.             It lies in an extensive clay
slate  formation,     and is interstratified with the slate, appearing on
the surface for about two miles, presenting a breadth of usually
about twenty feet, and a thickness as far as could be ascertained of
ten. Its presence does not appear to communicate fertility to the
soil.    It is composed of phosphate of lime, associated with fluoride
of calcium, oxide of iron and silica. The authors examined it with
a view to its employment as a manure; but great difficulties exist
with respect to               its
                        transportation.

    The species from the beds discovered by Mr. Kaye at Pondicherry
are, with a few exceptions, new. Among those from Verdachellum
and Trinconopoly, are several well-known greensand fossils. The
Pondicherry beds appear, from the evidence afforded by their organic
 contents, to belong to the lowest part of the lower greensand; whilst
 those at Verdachellum and Trinconopoly may be referred to the upper
 greensand. In this Report 156 new species of Mollusca are described
 and named.

    The chief objects of this paper are, 1st, to sustain Mr. Murchison's
 original opinion, that the rothe-todte-liegende forms the true base of
 the Permian system; 2ndly, to point out the equivalents in Western
 Europe of the Russian series of this age, and to extend the upper
 palaeozoic rocks, so as to embrace the lower part of the bunter sand
 stein; 3rdly, to analyse the flora and fauna, showing, that whilst
 connected downwards with the carboniferous rocks, they were en
 tirely dissimilar from those of the overlying trias; and, lastly, to

the rings on the external surface of others as produced by the same
cause.   He described specimens in which the so-called Sternbergia
formed the centre or pith of fossil stems.
   4. “On a Fossil Crustacean from New Holland.” By Prof. Tho
mas    Bell.
     This, the only fossil  crustacean as yet found in Australia, was pro
cured by Lieutenant Emery, and forwarded by Mr. W. S. Macleay,
who considered it as probably a Thalassina. Prof. Bell regards it as
a new Thalassina, nearly allied to the only known living species of
that genus, and names it T. antiqua.
   March 6.-A paper was read, entitled, “Contributions to the Geo
logy of North Wales.” By Mr. Daniel Sharpe.
   The observations contained in this memoir were made during a
tour through a large part of North Wales, with the object of endea
vouring to ascertain what beds                           lie
                                            below the Silurian rocks which

  twelve of which belong to the placoid order, one is a ganoid, and one
  a cycloid fish.     Among them is Coraw pristodontus, identical with
 the Maestricht    species.    From the evidence afforded by the exami
 nation of these    fishes, Sir Philip Egerton takes the same view of the
  age of the beds which was inferred by Prof. E. Forbes from the in
 vertebrate remains (p. 217), considering them as belonging to the cre
  taceous aera, though he is inclined to place them higher in the series.

 water Shells, in the series of the Plastic Clay at New Cross, Kent.”
 By H. Warburton, Esq., M.P., F.R.S., Pres. G.S.
     The bed described does not form a continuous stratum, but occurs
 with interruptions and intervals in the condition of Septaria, which
 contain remains of shells of the genera Paludina and Unio. A sec
 tion of the locality, showing the position of the bed, was made by
 Mr. Simms. In France similar associations of freshwater remains
 have been noticed in the plastic clay series by M. D'Archiac.
     May 1.—The following papers were read:—
     1. “Report on the Fossils from S. Fé de Bogota, in South Ame
 rica, presented to the Society by Mr. E. Hopkins.” By the Curator.
     These fossils belong to seventeen species of Mollusca, of which
 nine are identical with species from the same locality, described by
 Von Buch, D'Orbigny, and Lea. They are from a dark compact
 limestone, which the reporter regards as a member of the lower part
 of the cretaceous system.       Eight of the species are new.
     2. “Comparative Remarks on the Sections of the Strata below the
 Chalk, on the Coast near Hythe in Kent, and Atherfield, in the Isle
 of Wight.” By Dr. Fitton.
     In this paper the author enters into an elaborate review of the
 state of our knowledge of the lower greensand in England, and
 compares the several deposits and their fossil contents.        After com
menting on the relations of that formation at Hythe, with the several
 strata of the Atherfield section, and showing the comparative state
of our knowledge of them when he read his memoir on the sub-cre
taceous strata in 1824, with the state of the subject at the present
day, he proceeds to examine the researches of M. Montmoulin in
 Switzerland, M. Dubois de Montperreaux in the Caucasus, MM.
Leymerie and D'Orbigny in France, and M. Roemer in Germany,
and to prove the identity of the beds styled by some of those authors
Neocomian with his lower greensand. Regarding both names as
objectionable, the former on account of      its  being derived from  a   lo
cality which will not serve    as
                               a     type for the formation, and the latter
because     itimplies erroneous relations,   he  proposes the term “Vec
tine,” from the island  in    which we find the strata of   this part of the
cretaceous system best displayed.

Lower Greensand clays resting       on   the Wealden  at  the cutting near

thickness of 843 feet, which constitute the lower greensand in this
section, the results of a chemical examination of the several strata
were stated.     The strata were grouped under three divisions, the
lowest  consisting  of fossiliferous clays, the middle of Gryphaea sands,
and the     upper of more or less ferruginous sands, mostly free from
fossils. An inquiry was entered into respecting the conditions under
which these beds were deposited, and the state of animal life in the
cretaceous seas during their formation. The distribution of their

proving the unity of the lower greensand, considered as a member
 of the cretaceous series. Capt. Ibbetson laid before the Society a
 model of the section, on the scale of three feet to the mile, con
 structed by himself from trigonometrical survey, on which the several
 strata described in the paper were laid down minutely.
    5. “Description of the mouth of a Hybodus, found by Capt. Ibbet
 son in the Isle of Wight.” By Sir Philip Grey Egerton, Bart., M.P.
    This fish was found at the junction of the Wealden with the lower
 greensand. The specimen sets at rest the question of the relative
 characters of the upper and lower teeth, and the general contour of
 the individuals composing the genus Hybodus, confirming the views
 of Prof. Agassiz. The species is new, and Sir Philip Egerton pro
poses to name   it   Hybodus     Bassanus.
   6. The President read extracts from letters lately addressed by
M. Dubois de Montperreaux and by Prof. Agassiz to Capt. Ibbetson,
on the subject of the Neocomian.         The former of these geologists
states that the Neuchatel beds cannot be regarded as complete, or as
the type of that formation, which he considers is best developed in
the Crimea and Caucasus. The latter considers the Neocomian as a
peculiar stage, and that the very lowest of the cretaceous system.*.

   1. A letter from Dr. Ick on some new fossil Crustacea, from the
South Staffordshire coal-field.
   2. “On the Geology of Cape Breton.”           By Mr. R. Brown.
   The newest stratified rocks in the island of Cape Breton belong to
the coal formation. The coal-field of Sidney occupies an area of 250
square miles, and appears, from the dip of the beds, to be a portion
of a still more extensive field. The coal measures repose on mill
stone grit of variable thickness and great extent.           Beneath the
millstone grit lies carboniferous limestone, associated with extensive
beds of gypsum and marls.        These gypsiferous beds     lie upon con
glomerates, which pass downwards into slates, corresponding        to  the
grauwacke formation        Europe.

States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, are of true carboniferous
species.      The strata containing them, as shown by Hitchcock, Jack
son and      others,  pass into mica-schist, clay-slate, and other meta
morphic rocks. The bed of plumbago and anthracite, two feet thick,
at Worcester, Massachusetts, is separated from the anthracite before
mentioned, by a district of gneiss, thirty-five miles wide. This bed
Mr. Lyell regards as coal in a still more completely metamorphic
state, all the volatile ingredients having been discharged and carbon
alone remaining, the accompanying coal-shales and grits having been
turned into carbonaceous clay-slate, mica-schist, with granite and
quartzite.       No similar beds are found in the North American Silu
rian formations.

    These bodies are semicircular, very thin, slightly concave plates,
usually corneous, sometimes more or less calcareous. Mr. Strickland
 regards them as having formed laminar appendages to the animals
 of the Ammonites, adapted to discharge some unascertained function.
 They resemble the two expanded valves of Aptychus, soldered toge
ther; and the author considers them as allied to that fossil, to which
he attributes a similar origin.

    VI. Further Remarks on the Revision of the Southern Constella
 tions.   By Sir  J. F. W. Herschel, Bart.*
    The idea originally proposed of entirely remodelling the south
 ern constellations, has (after very mature consideration and much
 discussion, and after consulting the opinions of some of the most
 eminent continental astronomers, which have been found very adverse
to the idea of so decided a change) been laid aside; at least in so
far as regards the new catalogue of stars, now printing under the
authority of the British Association.         It is conceived, however, that
if the nomenclature of the     constellations,    generally, be ever destined
to   undergo  a systematic   change  at all (and many reasons may be ad
duced for    considering   such a   change     desirable), the first and most
important step towards it will be found in the work above alluded
to, and in the catalogues now publishing simultaneously with it on
the same system of nomenclature, which clear the ground of all ex
isting confusion; and, by assembling into one distinct view, and
under names and numbers at least definite and recognised, all the
    [* An abstract of Sir John Herschel’s former paper on this subject will
be found in Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xix. p. 582.]

individuals of which the new groups must be composed, it will be
easy at any future time to pass, by a single table of synonyms and
by one decided step, from one to the other system, whenever the
convenience and consent of astronomers may dictate the propriety of
 a change. Such views, if entertained, would render the nomencla
 ture of the present catalogues so far provisional that a more rational
 and convenient system of groups (confined not to the southern hemi
 sphere, but extending over both) may yet be contemplated by astro
 nomers. Nevertheless, so long as the ancient system is at all re
 tained, a general and scrupulous adherence to the nomenclature here
 adopted is most earnestly recommended to the astronomical world,
 as the only mode of escape from that state of confusion at present
 quite intolerable.   As regards the southern constellations, the fol
 lowing are the principles proposed; viz.
     1. That         all
                 the constellations adopted       Lacaille                by

 alterations hereafter specified.

the lines.    Secondly, such stars         have been previously observed
by Ptolemy        Flamsteed, and

observations through which the errors of division must be deter
mined, in order that their results may be also independent of the
influence of gravity.
    “It follows also from this that the astronomer who uses a circle
is in possession of the means of rendering his results entirely inde
pendent of the influence of gravity; and that results obtained by
different instruments, when this method is followed, must accurately
agree.     It is likewise to be remarked, that the power of reversing
the axis is an advantage with which the independence of the zenith
distances of the influence of gravity is connected (and without which
such independence could not be obtained).
    “Although of no use in a practical point of view, it may not be
uninteresting to investigate the numerical result which the theory

dimensions of my 3-feet circle by Repsold, and found that one of its

     MINERALOGICAL NOTICEs.                 BY    J. E. TESCHEMACHER, Esq.
    Glauberite,   brought from Tarapaca, Peru, by Mr. John H. Blake.
     This mineral is found in small crystals, which are imbedded in a
 beautiful, silky, fibrous borate of lime, published in Alger's edition
 of Phillip's Mineralogy under the name of Hayesine.
     This glauberite was analysed by A. A. Hayes, and found to contain
                         Sulphuric acid. . . .         57:220

 It is  essentially a compound of sulphate of lime and sulphate of soda.
 The first crystals    I measured, the figure and measurements of which
 are in the last edition of Dana's Mineralogy, were extremely dull,
 so that I could only consider them as approximative.                Mr. Hayes
 afterwards sent me some extremely brilliant crystals, the measure
 ments of which coincided exactly with those of the glauberite from
 Villa Rubia in Spain. The figure above named is that of the first
 crystals I found.      Subsequently others came to light, of very differ
 ent forms, produced by other modifications.
     It is stated in Dana, that if crystals of glauberite are left in water,
 they will at length fall to pieces.            This is probably true. Those
from     Tarapaca,    if treated   carefully       with cold water, will permit
nearly all the sulphate of soda to be dissolved out, leaving the form
of the crystal unaltered, and the edges as sharp as ever. Their ap
pearance before the microscope, after the loss of the sulphate of soda,
is that of snowy-white, fine granular sulphate of lime (alabaster).
From 15 grains of this glauberite I have obtained 6% grains anhy
drous sulphate of soda, and do not doubt that the whole quantity
 might with care be extracted.               If some forms of these alabaster
crystals had been first found and analysed, they would have been
pronounced to be pseudomorphous forms of an unknown mineral, of
which sulphate of lime had taken the place.
     Now, if the action of the solvent powers of various chemical so
lutions, as well as those of the gases which can be held by water,
be studied with care, the natural decomposition of many minerals,
as well as their replacement by other substances, in what are called
pseudomorphous forms, will be very much illustrated.
                                     Pyrrhite.
    Prof. J. W. Webster, of Harvard University, has lately returned
from the Azores, and brought with him some interesting minerals,
several of which he has most kindly placed in my hands; amongst
others, a beautiful arragonite, at first sight much resembling the
needlestone.
    He also favoured me with two small specimens of a felspathic

232             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
mineral, probably albite, on which were several extremely minute
but beautiful octahedral crystals, of a deep orange to a wine-yellow
colour, the smallest transparent, the largest translucent on edges.
    At first I considered this a new mineral, until, on comparing it
with the account of pyrrhite, in Jameson's Edinburgh Journal, vol.
xxix., the resemblance struck me. I therefore sacrificed these cry
stals to the blowpipe; they gave the following indications:—
    The minutest transparent crystals changed immediately, in the
reducing flame, to a deep, dull indigo blue, perfectly distinct; the
edges then rounded, and, after considerable exposure, fused without
intumescence; on the application of borax, the fusion was immediate,
and a small, transparent, light brown bead remained. The largest
crystal was then exposed to the outer flame; it became opake, of a
light gray colour; before the reducing flame it changed apparently
to black; but the blue colour is clearly seen, in a strong light, on
the solid angles. Of this crystal the edges alone could be rounded
by long exposure.
    The hardness is about equal to felspar, and the form is that of the
regular octahedron. Although this form is unknown among titanic
minerals, the experiments of Kersten lead me to suppose that it be
longs to this family.
                           Bucholzite and Xenolite.
     In April  1843,  I read a paper before this Society, which was pub
 lished   among   their Proceedings, in which I asserted the identity of
 these two minerals.       This has been confirmed by Rammelsberg, in
his Supplement, published July 1843, from a consideration of the
 similarity of their chemical constituents.     This question may there
 fore be considered as settled; but it is not probable that Rammels
 berg had seen the paper alluded to above.
 On the singular Crystals     of Galena, figured in Alger's and in Dana's
                                 Mineralogy.
     A  good explanation of the formation of these singular crystals may
 be   given as follows:–It is well known that a liquid globule of phos
 phate of lead, on cooling, from the action of the blowpipe, takes a
 polyhedral form, generally that of a rhombic or pentagonal dodeca
 hedron.
     A microscopic examination of this cooling process shows that, as
  the outer surface of the globule cools, the angles of the planes appear
  to start out from the circumference, the planes to flatten into their
  symmetrical shape; the uncooled liquid central portion, pressed by
  the contraction of the cooling exterior, oozes out from the middle of
  the plane, and spreads in a thin liquid plate over part of the sur
  face, taking nearly the form of the plane; contraction still continu
  ing, a succession of thin plates ooze out, each of course spreading
  somewhat short of its predecessor, but retaining the same form.
  This is probably the mode of the formation of these crystals of Ga
  lena, all of which bear the appearance of having undergone fusion.
   On many crystals of fluor spar from England, successive plates of
  this kind may be observed; many of them, however, do not take

                       Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                                 233
their origin from the centre of the plane. If these, like those of
phosphate of lead, are formed by the sudden cooling of heated solu
tions, this may easily be accounted for on the assumption that one
side of the crystal was attached near the source of heat; the other
side cooling more rapidly, the liquid inside oozed out nearer the
more heated and still soft edge or plane. The crystals of phosphate
of lead, on the contrary, cool equally on all sides. Forms of quartz
with these plates are quite common; and I have recently found cry
stals of phosphate of lime, from Grafton, New Hampshire, with the
same appearance.     These plates have been considered as marks of
cleavage lines; and it is evident that the cooling of each plate, pre
vious to the superimposition of a fresh one, would cause less strength
of adhesion between them than between other lines of the crystal.
                                    Pyrochlore.              (Microlite.)
    The close examination of above 200 crystals of the mineral named
microlite by Prof. Shepard, and the comparison of them with about
50 crystals of pyrochlore from the Swedish localities and from the
 Ural Mountains, resulting in their agreement in colour, cleavage,
 crystalline form and modifications, indicated to me, in 1841, the
 complete identity of the two minerals, although Wöhler's analysis
had decreed the latter to be a titanate, while Shepard's had made
 the former a columbate of lime.
     This identity, strenuously resisted by Prof. Shepard, although on
grounds which show a very superficial knowledge of the whole sub
ject, has been completely proved by subsequent analyses, particu
larly by that of A. A. Hayes, in Silliman's Journal, vol. xxxii. p. 341,

 those of Wöhler.

Chesterfield, of a brilliant, transparent, dark ruby red. I name this
subject, because, as in the previous instance of pyrochlore, the small
transparent crystals of minerals are usually most free from adultera

    Protochlorate of Iron.—A colourless neutral solution of this salt
 is obtained by decomposing a solution of protosulphate of iron with
 one of chlorate of barytes, both solutions being cold.           This salt de
 composes spontaneously when the solution is not kept at a very low
 temperature; it then loses          neutrality, precipitates basic perchlo

   Chlorate of Copper.—The solution of this salt, obtained by the
decomposition of chlorate of barytes and sulphate of copper, yielded
by evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric acid, a dark green liquid of
the consistence of a syrup, which became a crystalline mass by ex
posure to intense cold. Distinct crystals, which appeared to be
regular octahedrons, were however rarely obtained. Chlorate of
copper is very deliquescent and very soluble in alcohol; it fuses at
149°, and begins to decompose at a somewhat higher temperature;
fused chlorate of copper does not solidify till the temperature is re
duced to about 68°, even when it has not suffered the slightest de
composition by heat; if it be heated to 212°, bubbles of gas are dis
engaged, each of which occasions a slight detonation.       When the
decomposition is effected at the lowest possible temperature, a green
residue is obtained, which suffers no further decomposition till heated
to above 500°; this is insoluble in water, but very soluble in dilute
acids; the solution in weak nitric acid gives no precipitate with ni
trate of silver; the solution in hydrochloric acid has a very distinct
smell of chlorine; this green substance is therefore a basic chlorate
of hydrate of copper.

    Chlorate of Lead.—A neutral solution of this salt is obtained by
saturating chloric acid with the oxide; its concentration may be
continued over the spirit-lamp, without decomposition, until it begins
to crystallize on cooling; the crystals are rhombic prisms; they are
 at first transparent and possess much lustre, but by exposure to the
air they quickly become dull and opake ; they do not deliquesce, but
they dissolve very readily in water and in alcohol.      When mixed
with combustible bodies, they detonate by percussion almost as
strongly as the potash salt. At 302° the crystals lose 4:59 per cent.
 of water; at 446° they are suddenly decomposed with a hissing
noise, yielding chlorine and oxygen, and a partly fused black mass
remains, which is a mixture of peroxide and chloride of lead; if the
heat be continued this yields oxygen, and is converted into basic
yellow chloride of lead, the composition of which is constant.

    Chlorate of Silver.--A neutral solution of this salt is obtained by
dissolving oxide of silver in chloric acid; this yields by evaporation
distinct prismatic crystals; chlorate of silver is anhydrous; it dis
solves in about five parts of cold water, and likewise in alcohol with
out suffering alteration; it fuses at 446°, and begins at 518° to give
off oxygen with a trace of chlorine; when heated until the evolution
of gas ceases, chloride of silver remains. The evolution of oxygen
is much more ready and rapid if the salt be mixed with oxide of
copper or peroxide of manganese.              If chlorate of silver be heated
very rapidly, it decomposes suddenly with explosion and the extri
cation of light. When mixed with combustible bodies, it detonates
by percussion much more strongly than the potash salt.

    If chlorine be passed   through water containing oxide of silver in
suspension, chlorate of silver is also formed; but if the current of
chlorine be too long continued, this salt decomposes and oxygen gas
is evolved, and there are formed chloride of silver and free chloric,
not perchloric acid. By the action of hypochlorous acid on oxide
of silver, or also upon finely divided metallic silver, no chloric acid
is formed, but a mixture of peroxide of silver and chloride of silver.
   Ammoniacal Chlorate of Silver.—Prismatic crystals of this salt are
obtained by dissolving chlorate of silver in ammonia, and evapora
ting the solution; these crystals are very soluble in water and in
alcohol; they melt at 212° and lose their ammonia, and when the
temperature does not exceed 534° pure chlorate of silver remains;
when heated rapidly they decompose with explosion and the emis
sion of light. The solution of this salt yields, on the addition of
potash, a gray precipitate of Berthollet's fulminating silver.

 ON  THE PROPERTIES AND COMPOSITION OF THE PROTOXIDE OF
                       GOLD.      BY M. L. FIGUIER.
    The modes of     preparing   the protoxide of gold proposed by the
 chemist above named were stated in the last Number of the Philoso
 phical Magazine; we proceed now to state the
    Properties of the Protowide of Gold.—In the state of hydrate it is
 of so dark a violet colour as to appear black; when dried it has the
 violet-blue colour of the powder of Cassius. It does not decompose

 238               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 below 482°Fahr., and it then yields oxygen; it is insoluble in water,
 and is not either dissolved or decomposed by alcohol.   Hydrochloric
 acid converts it into metallic  gold which separates, and terchloride
 of gold which dissolves; this reaction requires a quarter of an hour
 to complete it when the acid is cold, but at a boiling heat it occurs
 instantaneously; in the former case protochloride of gold is at first
 formed, which itself afterwards decomposes by the usual reaction on
 the contact of water,
                        3(Auº Cl) = Auº Cl2 + Au".
        Hydriodic acid when brought into contact with protoxide of gold
 becomes of a deep yellow colour, and deposits protiodide of gold of a
 greenish colour. The supernatant liquor is a solution of protiodide
 of gold in hydriodic acid.              If
                               the whole be boiled, the iodine is dis
 engaged in the form of violet vapours, and the gold is precipitated.
There is not therefore produced, under these circumstances, a per
iodide of gold corresponding to the perchloride.
   Hydrobromic acid acts like hydriodic acid; it gives when cold a
brown deposit of bromide and becomes of a deep colour; if it be
boiled the liquor becomes quite light-coloured; aqua regia dissolves
the protoxide immediately, but neither sulphuric, nitric, nor acetic
acid has any action upon               it;
                              potash and soda dissolve    only when                           it

                                                    of
 bases; thus, while potash dissolves       the nascent state (for ex

This liquor, when not strong,                      has the colour of weak tincture of
litmus, but when concentrated it appears black; it remains clear for
two or three days, but after this the oxide is entirely precipitated,
and remains at the bottom of the vessel in the form of a blue cloud.
The addition of a soluble salt to this liquor, when heated, occasions
the instantaneous separation of the oxide, and a few drops of hydro
chloric acid soon render it bright.
    It does not always happen that distilled water produces the above
described appearance, but the cause of the variation is not apparent;
the mode of solution appears, however, to be similar to that of iodide
of starch, prussian blue, &c. &c.--Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Juillet

of which indeed the first answers to the well-known relation
(already employed in this paper), connecting a side with the
three angles of a spherical triangle. The three other equa
tions (K.) correspond to and contain a theorem (perhaps new),
which may be enunciated thus: that if three forces be applied
at the centre of the sphere, one equal to sin R cos R' and                                                                di

rected to R', and the third equal to sin R sin R' sin R R! and
directed to that pole of the arc R R' which lies towards the
same side of this arc as the point R', the resultant of these
three forces will be directed to R", and will be equal to sin R".
 It is not difficult to prove this theorem otherwise, but it may
be regarded as interesting to see that the four real equations

248           Prof. Daniell and Dr. Miller on the
ness, the saline residue was ignited, and weighed 21 grains.
It was sulphate of potassa, and the amount, as before, was
within one grain of the quarter of an equivalent.
  (u.) Some of the double sulphate of magnesia and potassa
(MgO, SO, + KO, SO) was carefully prepared, and sub
mitted in solution to the same treatment. After 48 cubic inches
of hydrogen had been collected the platinode solution was
evaporated to dryness, and left a saline residue of 36-6 grains.
This was redissolved and treated with carbonate of potassa.
A precipitate of carbonate of magnesia was thus obtained,
which was reconverted into sulphate, and weighed 3-8 grains;
this was equivalent to 0-76 grain of magnesium, to which must
be added 0-24 grain recovered from the wash water by means
of phosphate of ammonia, making the total quantity of magne
sium which had passed over to the platinode 1-0, or about 12th
of an equivalent. Deducting the total amount of sulphate of
magnesia, 498 grains, from the mixed sulphates, 36.6 grains,
we have 31-62 as the amount of the sulphate of potassa.
   Thus it appeared that the three bases, alumina, magnesia,
and oxide of copper, or their metals, when in combination
with sulphuric acid and potassa, refused to travel from the
zincode to the platinode under the influence of the voltaic cur
rent into an acid with which they were capable of forming an
immediate and soluble combination.          Could it be that the
same results    might  follow from the  electrolysis   of the single
salts of the same acid 2
   (w.) Some pure sesquisulphate of alumina (Al2O3, 3SO)
was prepared by precipitating alum with excess of ammonia,
thoroughly washing the precipitate and redissolving it in sul
phuric acid, with the aid of heat. An excess of alumina was
left, from which the liquid was separated by filtration. It was
then evaporated till it solidified upon cooling.      The mass was
subjected to pressure in calico, and the dry salt dissolved in
water.
   The zincode and connecting cells of the diaphragm appa
ratus were then charged with the solution, and the platinode
cell with dilute sulphuric acid. The arrangement conducted
well, and in half an hour 13 cubic inches of oxygen were col
lected from the zincode.      The process was then stopped, and
on supersaturating the liquid at the platinode with ammonia,
the slightest possible trace of alumina was precipitated.
   Thus it again appeared that the electrolysis was carried on
without the transfer of the base or    itsmetal   to the platinode.
    Was the peculiar constitution    of this salt
                                                   as

zincode      twenty-eight minutes. On neutralizing the liquid

electrolyte to another was in any way concerned in preventing
the transfer of the base, we now resolved to employ sulphate
of copper in solution throughout the whole arrangement, and
having carefully ascertained the proportion of copper in solu
tion, we placed 1500 grains of the liquid in each cell; metallic
copper was thrown down on the platinode, and on precipita
ting the oxide from the liquid in the cell by potash, we found
exactly the same amount of copper (taking the united quanti
ties obtained from the oxide precipitated, and from the metal
deposited) as before the experiment.        An equivalent of sul
phuric acid was set free at the zincode, but the quantity of the
copper solution in the cell continued the same as at the com

with itself in electrolysis.
   Sulphate of zinc afforded results exactly similar.

   We were next induced to seek for some such connexion
between the attraction of the different acids for water, and
their transfer to the zincode. Our experiments had already
embraced a great variety of acids, differing very much from
one another in this respect, and in every case the transfer had
taken place; but our attention had not yet been directed to
the quantitative results.
   (a.f.) As tungstic acid forms no definite hydrate, and is                                      in

and for this purpose prepared some pure tungstate of soda
(NaO, WO) by fusing together equivalent quantities of the
acid and carbonate of soda.        The product of the operation
was dissolved and    crystallized.    A solution was made which

power evinced            water   by these and other experiments, we

may be convenient to distinguish the following classes:–
  1st. An electrolyte may consist of simple ions, and then
must be constituted of a single equivalent of a metal (or H)
for      its
       cation, and                          single equivalent                 of       non-metallic ele

simple electrolytes.
   2nd. An electrolyte may consist            compound cation,            of  a                                   a
single equivalent    which must take the place
                                    of                  metal; and                        of  a
a single equivalent      simple non-metallic anion,
                                     of   a               NH4, Cl.                                as
Organic alkalies probably form compound cations             this na                                of

these and the following we may call complex electrolytes.
   3rd. An electrolyte may consist             compound anion,            of   a                                  a
single equivalent                   of
                     which would take the     place      the simple                           of
non-metallic anion, with     single equivalent   a    simple cation,                   of a
a metal (or H),     H, NC2; K, SOA; Na, NO3.

   4th. An electrolyte may consist         single equivalent         of   a                                      of

compound cation, and     single equivalenta       compound anion,               of   a
as  NH4, SO1.
   These four cases may        included               be

Electrolytes,     single equivalent

   5th. An electrolyte may also consist       two     more equiva              of         or
lents        of
            metallic cation

    more metallic cations (or H); when the anion must consist
of or

256         Dr. Fresenius on an improved Method for the
   Dr. Fresenius states the objection to the method of Reinsch
to be :—1. That it does not admit of the detection of arsenic
in every form in which it may exist. 2. It does not aid the
detection of other poisons. 3. It contaminates the substances
under examination with copper. 4. Its success in precipi
tating the arsenic is impeded or altogether prevented by the
presence of many substances, nitrates, mercury and other
metallic compounds. 5. Almost insurmountable difficulties
in determining the arsenic quantitatively are attached to this
method.
   The method of Marsh presents these difficulties:–1. It does
not admit of the separation of the arsenic under every form
in which it may occur. 2. It contributes to the contamination
of the substance under examination with zinc and other me
tals. 3. The danger of mistaking antimony mirrors for ar
senic. 4. Mirrors are either not formed at all, or their
brilliancy is prevented, and the proof of the existence of
arsenic rendered doubtful by the presence of water, of organic
substances, and atmospheric air.
   The method of investigating the body in cases of suspected
poisoning, for the presence of arsenic, which we propose, is as
follows:—
                           A. Decoloration and Solution.
     The   substances intended for examination are,         if they con
sist of solid and coherent      lumps,  reduced into small pieces,
and under        all
                 circumstances carefully intermixed. Two-thirds
of  the whole mixture are then put into                large porcelain
                                                                   a

     whole liquid thus obtained is then concentrated in the water
     bath to the weight of 1 pound (during their operation the
     bright yellow colour of the fluid in most cases changes into a
     brownish tint), and a saturated solution of sulphurous acid in
     water is added to the residuary, still very acid, fluid, with
     stirring, until the smell of the sulphurous acid becomes clearly
     perceptible.    The whole mixture is then again heated for
     about an   hour,  until the excess of sulphurous acid is com
     pletely expelled.

     amount of the hydrochloric acid employed) is allowed to cool,
                                                                                      j
     and then poured into a beaker glass, and a slow stream of
     washed sulphuretted hydrogen gas transmitted through it for
     the space of about twelve hours; the gas conducting tube is
     rinsed with some solution of ammonia, and the ammoniacal
     solution thus obtained added to the fluid in the beaker glass;
     this glass is then lightly covered with printing paper    kept
     at a very  moderately   warm heat (30°C.) until the smell of
     sulphuretted hydrogen has completely disappeared. The
     precipitate obtained in this manner is collected upon a filter,
     which ought not to be too large, and washed.

completely lost the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, is filtered
upon the smallest possible filter, carefully washed, and while
still moist upon the filter drenched with solution of ammonia,
and the filter also washed with dilute ammonia until perfectly
free from the precipitate. The ammoniacal fluid is then poured
into a small porcelain basin, the weight of which has previ
ously been exactly determined, and evaporated in the water
bath; the residue is dried at 100° C. and weighed. Should
the subsequent reduction prove that the residue consisted of
arsenic alone, then 0-803 is the amount of arsenious acid to
be reckoned for every 1000 of the sulphuret of arsenic ob
tained. Should a residue insoluble in ammonia have remained
upon the filter, this must be tested for lead, bismuth, copper,
&c. &c. Lead and mercury may moreover be present in the
charred residue of C; this latter also must therefore be fur
ther tested for the presence of these substances.
           E. Reduction of the Sulphuret of Arsenic.
   The  separation  of the metallic arsenic from the sulphuret
of arsenic, as the key-stone of the whole investigation, requires
the greatest care and attention. The apparatus sketched in
fig. 1 is used for the reduction of the sulphuret of arsenic.

 crystalline substance.      Subsequently, in 1815, the     L. saccha
rina and five other fuci were again subjected to analysis by
 M. Gaultier de Claubry, who also detected in the L. saccha
rina and in the Halydris siliquosa the same saccharine sub
 stance, which he called manna.
    From the imperfect state of organic chemistry at these
early periods, neither of these eminent chemists were enabled
to subject this saccharine substance to analysis; and so little
reliance has been placed upon their statements, that for some
years past they have been generally discredited both by che
mists and botanists; Berzelius, for instance, has not once
mentioned sea-weeds as a source of mannite, though he has
enumerated all the other known sources; and Dr. Greville,
in his Algae Britannica, regards the crystalline incrustations
which usually appear on the L. saccharina and the Halydris
siliquosa when dried, as nothing else than common salt.
                                  I
Under these circumstances was lately induced to subject the
L. saccharina and some other sea-weeds to examination.
    A quantity of the dried L. saccharina was repeatedly           di
gested with hot water, which formed with it a mucilaginous
solution of a brownish red colour, and of a sweetish but at the
same time of a very disagreeable taste.        When evaporated to
dryness on the water-bath, it left a considerable quantity of a
saline semi-crystalline mass. This was reduced to powder
and treated with boiling alcohol, by which a considerable
portion of it was dissolved. The alcoholic solution on cooling
became nearly solid, from the quantity of long transparent
prismatic crystals with which it was filled.         When purified
by a second crystallization, these were deposited in large hard
prisms of a fine silky lustre, and possessing all the external
characters of mannite. When dried at 212° F., they were
subjected to analysis.
     I. 0.4334 grm. of substance gave 06235 of carbonic acid
and 0.2995 of water.               -

    It is evident from the result of these analyses, that the sweet
crystalline substance in the L. saccharina is nothing else than
mannite. The quantity of mannite contained in it is very consi

264    Dr. Stenhouse           on the occurrence              of Mannite in           the
derable. One thousand grains of the dried sea-weed, when
treated in the way already described, first with water and then
with alcohol, gave 121.5 grains = 12:15 per cent. The specimen
operated on had been kept for six months, and was covered
with an incrustation in long slender needles. I also examined
a quantity of the fresh sea-weed, and found it to contain as
much mannite as the older specimen.             It appears, therefore,
that the epithet saccharina, as applied to this species of                                   La
minaria, is not so inappropriate as has been often supposed.
    Mannite may be easily distinguished from cane-sugar by
the following test.           If
                            a little strong sulphuric acid is poured
upon the mannite and a gentle heat is applied, the mannite
dissolves without being in the least discoloured, and gives a
transparent solution.              If
                              the heat is much increased the liquid
becomes of a deep brown colour, but does not lose                   trans             its
parency. When cane-sugar,               the   on
                                            contrary,      gently  heated  is

 without   any  change         of
                             colour,   while  grape-sugar    when simi

           Laminaria saccharina and other Sea-weeds.          265
tioned, mannite forms a great part of the white incrustations
which appear on the surface of this sea-weed when dried.
   Alaria esculenta.-This beautiful sea-weed, which is by no
means uncommon on the coasts of Scotland, where, as its
name imports, it often serves as an article of food, also con
tains mannite in considerable abundance.
   Rhodomenia palmata.—Rhodomenia palmata, or common
dulse, contains a good deal of a sweet-tasted greenish-coloured
mucilage. It also yields a considerable quantity of mannite,
amounting probably to 2 or 3 per cent.
   Fucus vesiculosus.-The Fucus vesiculosus, the most common
perhaps of British Algae, contains     I should think from 1 to 2
per cent. of mannite, and the Fucus nodosus, also a very com
mon sea-weed, likewise yields a small but very appreciable
quantity of the same principle.
   Fucus serratus.-This sea-weed also contains a consider
able quantity of mannite, less perhaps than the L. digitata,
but more than the Rhodomenia palmata. The mannite which
the Fucus serratus yields is much freer from colouring matter
than that from any of the other Algae, being nearly colourless
from the first.
   I could not detect any mannite in the Ulva latissima or
Laver. The experiment was made on a very small scale, and
will be repeated on the first opportunity. The Laver contains
a good deal of a sweet-tasted green-coloured mucilage, similar
to that of the Rhodomenia palmata.
   As mannite has occurred in eight out of nine of the sea
weeds which    I have happened to examine, it probably exists
in larger or smaller quantity in most sea-weeds, in which it
appears to replace the cane- and grape-sugar so abundant in
many of our land-plants.       It is evident also that mannite oc
curs much more     plentifully  in nature than has been hitherto
imagined. The following is a list of the Algae just described,
arranged in order according to the quantity of mannite which
they severally contain   :-
      1. Laminaria saccharina.         5. Alaria esculenta.
      2. Halydris siliquosa.           6. Rhodomenia palmata.
      3. Laminaria digitata.           7. Fucus vesiculosus.
      4. Fucus serratus.               8. Fucus nodosus.
   The quantity of mannite in the L. saccharina is       such that
I think  mannite might be more oeconomically procured from
this sea-weed than from the usual source, manna.

Supposed existence               of Mannite in              the Roots        of Triticum   repens,
                                                or   Couch-grass.
   In a note on the article Mannite, in the eighth volume of the
last German edition of Berzelius's Lehrbuch, it is stated that
 Professor Pfaff had succeeded in obtaining mannite from the
roots of Triticum repens, or couch-grass.     M. Pfaff says that
he treated the extract of the   couch-grass   roots with boiling
alcohol, which on cooling deposited a number of long needle
shaped crystals, which he believed to be a new species of
sugar, but which Berzelius is rather disposed to regard as
more probably mannite. I have twice repeated M. Pfaff’s
experiment on two different quantities of couch-grass roots,
but with very opposite results. The alcoholic solution on
standing deposited it is true a quantity of long slender cry
stalline needles.  These, however, had not a sweet taste, and
when thrown into hot sulphuric acid they dissolved with effer
vescence without blackening the solution.       When heated on
platinum foil they melted, and left a white fusible alkaline
residue, which, when neutralized with muriatic acid, produced
a yellow crystalline precipitate in an alcoholic solution of pla
tinum.    I have every reason to believe, therefore, that these
acicular crystals were merely binoxalate of potash. The grass
roots certainly contained a great deal of an uncrystallizable
sugar which readily fermented.

mena, whether unpublished or already known, by endeavour
ing to sketch out this general theory which the science does
not possess.
                         §    I.   Description   of the Apparatus.
  3.     I constructed a               triple helix of large dimensions by                               roll
ing at one operation, on a great wooden bobbin, three copper
wires covered with silk and perfectly annealed. Each of these
wires is 23*6 long and 0”003 in diameter. They are so ar
ranged that in         the circumvolutions the middle wire pre
                               all
serves        its
           position with regard         the two others.         to  this                          It   is
which, for brevity, shall designate the induced wire, reserving
                                   I
the name            of
              inductor wires for                              its
                                      two neighbours indifferently.
Their diameter sufficient ensure that they are never heated
                              is                     to

more than 0",0008        diameter. Two
                                     in    amongst    them are equal,
and each            of
              them makes 500      turns;  the  third,    little thicker,                a
only makes               75

from the first,     the circumstance that the wires            their su                      in
perposed layers are    always       the same direction and

and has a constant force.   The zincs are amalgamated solid
cylinders, of Om:15 long and 0”045 in diameter; they are
immersed in a solution of chloride of sodium, inclosed in mem
brane. The coppers are hollow cylinders of Om'06 in dia
meter, immersed in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper.
The energy of this apparatus is sustained during more than
five hours without very perceptible variations*.

that when the conducting wire of a current is connected with
another wire convolved in the form of a helix,               conducti                                         its

               a. The state of the simultaneous or separate closing or
           opening of the circuits of the induced wire and of the second
          inductor wire has no influence on the intensity of the inducing
          current (<).
               b. This intensity diminishes in arithmetical progression, for
          the lengths of the inductor wire increase in geometrical pro
          gression (m).
               c. The intensity of the inducing current is independent of
          the presence or the absence of a voltaic current in the induced
          wire; it does not vary with the state of closure or of open
          ing of the circuit of the second inductor ().

 into the second, the direction of the two currents being the
 same.    Thus we find, that if the two inductor currents are
 equal, the rheometric deviations which measure the intensities
 are double what they are with a single current; and if the
'currents are unequal, the deviations are the sum of the effects
 of each elementary current (y).
    23. Second case.—I even employed the great helix and a
 pile of ten pairs. The two inductor wires were joined end to
 end, so that the direction of the current in the one was op
 posed to the direction of that in the other.      The equality of
 their dimensions and of their conductibility involved the
 equality of the current which traversed each of them, a cur
 rent the value of which amounted to half that of the pile. The
induced currents also were perfectly equal, and as their direc
 tions were opposed, the needle of the rheometer remained
 quite motionless. The result was the same whether the cir
cuit was broken or closed (x).
    24. That the indications of the rheometer are indeed the
 measure of the currents simultaneously induced might be dis
puted. In order to reply to this objection, I substituted the
metallic thermometer of Bréguet for this instrument.           At the
rupture as well as at the closing of the inductor currents, the
needle of this very delicate apparatus remained stationary.
This experiment repeated a great number of times invariably
gave the same result.*.     I also substituted the small helix for
the thermometer; small needles of tempered steel were not
magnetized, in                   its
                      interior, either     the closing,        at the                or   at
rupture       of

   26. Fourth case.—This was studied like the second, with
the apparatus mentioned (23.).      The laws which govern it
are—-
   a. For the additional lengths of the inductor wire, increa
sing in geometrical progression, the deviations of the rheo
meter, which measure the difference of intensity of the two
currents simultaneously induced, increase according to an
arithmetical progression, the first term of which is zero, and
the last term of which is equivalent to the action of the con
stant inducing wire, taken by itself, even at an infinite additional
length (v).
   0. From whence it results, that for additional lengths, which
increase in geometrical progression, the differences between
the effects of induction, produced by the two wires simultane
ously, and those which the variable wire produces by itself,
diminish according to an arithmetical progression (£).
   c. The value of the ratio of these arithmetical progressions
varies with the nature and the dimensions of the additional
wire employed (o).
   d. The presence or the absence of bars of soft iron in the
helixes only modifies the intensity of the induction (tr),

     37. This explains why the closure of the circuit induced by
the aid of a voltaic pile diminishes the brightness of the sparks,
without the direction or the intensity of the current of this ap
paratus having the least influence; the pile evidently acts as
an imperfect conductor.
     38. When the inductor circuit is closed by a voltameter in
which some acidulated water for example is electrolysed, the
quantity of gas obtained in the unit of time is independent of
the presence or the absence of the metallic bundles [..<U+017F>aisceaur]
in the bobbin; it does not vary equally when we pass or arrest
a continued current in any direction through the induced
 wire.
    §  V.  Influence   of the Atmospheric Pressure upon Induction.
                     A. Static Induction or Influence.
      39.  Mr. Faraday, in his beautiful researches in electricity,
 has entered upon the question of the relation which exists be
 tween the atmospheric pressure and statical induction*.             I shall
 relate a few of my numerous experiments upon the same sub
ject; experiments which are only new or varied forms of those
 of the learned English natural philosopher, and which lead to
 similar conclusions.
      40.  I have employed a large electrical machine, the plate of
 which is 0”85 in diameter, and the brass conductors of which
 are each 0"90 long and on 108 in diameter.                Under favour
 able circumstances it       gives  sparks   0”27 to   0"32;   sparks are
 drawn from it       easily  at 0” 11 to 0"16 distance.
      41. On operating in the dark, every time a spark is drawn
 from the machine, there springs a purple glow (purpurine) be
 tween the two balls or the two charcoal points, which termi
 nate at an inch distance, the stems of an electrical egg void of
 air; but this light disappears in proportion to the return of
  the fluid.       With my machine this luminous appearancet
  scarcely takes place but at a maximum distance of a metre
  from the conductors, and appears the more brilliant in pro
  portion to the proximity of the egg.           For each distance it re
  mains the      same,   whether the     egg   rests upon an insulating
  support, or whether it is connected with the ground by the
  mediation of the hand or a metallic chain.
      42. It is not even necessary to draw a spark from the con
      * Experimental   Researches, §§ 1613 to 1616; also $$ 1359, 1405, 1526
  to 1543.
     + It is what Mr. Faraday calls glow, and what the Germans designate by
  das elektrische Glimmen. It is distinct from the spark, properly so called,
  spark, brush, funke.

                  on various Phaenomena         of Induction.             279
ductor in order to obtain the appearance of the electric glow
(lueur); it is observable without interruption as soon as the
plate is turned rather rapidly, on placing the egg at a proper
distance.
    43. Upon the glass plate of the air-pump I spread a leaf of
                                      I
the same nature, on which insulated a brass button of Om'048
diameter. This ball was covered with a glass funnel reversed,
in the neck of which I cemented a stem, also of brass, of Om'004
thickness, and terminated below by a ball 0"024 in diameter.
 Between the two balls there was about 0”019 interval.       The
funnel was itself   placed under a glass  bell, bearing a leather
valve and a stem which descended to 0”03 from the prece
ding.    After exhaustion of the air, the same phaenomena
appeared, the plate (secondary) employed being placed in
communication with the ground or insulated on a glass plate.
    44. Analogous results were obtained on replacing the bell
furnished with the metallic stem, projecting exteriorly, by an
attached glass bell; the balls were then in the most perfect
 state of insulation and in the most perfect vacuum.          em      I
ployed a double-cylinder air-pump by Babinet.
    45.       I
          have thus proved, that on placing an electrical egg
near a   Leyden   jar of mean dimensions and charged to satura
 tion, there is no luminous spark between the charcoal points,
 when the electrical explosion between the two armatures takes
 place instantaneously, whilst a very brilliant one is visible
during the entire duration of a prolonged discharge, such as
is obtained by means of a point.     I believe this observation is
Inew.
                            B. Dynamical Induction.
   46. The small helix was placed on the plate of the air
pump. By means of very fine copper wires covered with silk,
a communication was made between the inductor wire and
piles of four or six
the   hydro-electrical       Fº
                             and between the induced wire and
                         rheometer.     These conducting wires,
plunged in the grease with which the broad surface of contact
of the bell-glass with the plate attached was covered, did not
at      all
       prevent    very good vacuum from being formed.

                        independent     the quantity

§   VI.  Examination of two circumstances under which the elec
      tric currents and the magnets do not produce induction.
   48. Since the labours of Ampère and Mr. Faraday upon
electro-magnetism and magneto-electricity, no attempts have
been made, that I am aware, to ascertain whether the presence
of a magnet or an electric current always induces electricity
in the neighbouring conductors, and whether induction takes
place in the same manner in all directions.
   49. To obtain some datum upon those problems which are
at the foundation of every solid theory of induction, it was ne
cessary to examine whether a rectilinear current induces sphe
rical electricity around every molecule of the conductor, sup
posed to be electrically isotropic           (that        (?)

net or of a conductor traversed by a current always induces
electricity in a neighbouring conductor, placed in a convenient
manner        To this question the reply must be negative.
   54. We know that if a natural or artificial magnet, or an
electro-dynamic helix, is brought near to an electro-magnet
of soft iron, the latter, on taking the magnetic power, produces
an instantaneous current of induction in its helix.           But when
the approach is made slowly, the developed current loses                                             its
intensity, and           by

     DEAR SIR,
      following up the ideas contained in my paper on the
IN   Diffusion of Gases, which you had the kindness to lay
before the public (pres. vol. p. 51), a subsequent consideration
has occurred to me which I now send you for publication.
The chemical constitution of the atmosphere is twenty-one
parts by measure of oxygen and seventy-nine parts by mea
sure of nitrogen.   Now supposing a tube twenty-one miles in
length and another seventy-nine miles, separated from each
other by a perfectly moveable diaphragm, the former filled
with oxygen and the latter with nitrogen gas, sound would
travel along this tube in a certain appreciable space of time
which can be calculated as follows. The data I extract from
Poisson’s Mécanique.
             a = velocity of sound
             g = 9n'80896

            3 = 15°-9 (centigrade)
           y = 1.3748.
  The velocity of sound is expressed by the following formula:
                 a    –   Vºžd                     29.
                                                  by

each other, sound would still travel     precisely the same time

                                                                  of by

             to                             the electrical phaeno

284              Mr. Gassiot             on an Experiment exhibiting
preconceived notion we might have entertained of the results
of any disturbance in that equilibrium; we must, therefore, for
the present content ourselves with admitting that some un
known cause exists, which upon the contact of zinc and cop
per determines the transfer of the positive and negative elec
tricities respectively to the two surfaces which are brought in
apposition.”
    Early in 1843 Professor Grove devised an experiment, a de
scription of which appears in the reports of a lecture given by
that gentleman at the London Institution, on the 18th of January
of that year: the experiment is thus described in the Literary
Gazette of the 21st of the same month:—“Discs of zinc and
copper were juxtaposed surface to surface, contact being pre
vented by a rim of paper, and yet when separated the electro
scope was affected: here then was no contact, and yet the elec
trical effects were produced, which should be so by the mutual
radiation, but which could not be by the contact theory.”
    Mr. Grove thinks the electrical phaenomena due to a radia
tion similar to that which takes place in the experiments of
Moser and others, and which produces a change, either phy
sical or chemical, upon the surfaces of the plates.
    On the 10th of February in the same year Mr. Grove re
peated the experiment at the Royal Institution (Electrical
Magazine, vol. i. p. 57), but still by many it has not been
considered an unexceptionable experiment; and, considering
 its important bearing          the contact theory, the objections
                                         on
that have been raised are      certainly deserving       attention: by
                                                                  of
some,       has been inferred that the mere interposition
           it                                                         rim       ofa
     paper might not have prevented actual metallic contact
of by of

     others,    itsomewhat fairly assumed that

     friction must        produced
                               be                  by
                                          the pressure        the discsof
against the paper, and that this would           itself in  sufficientbe               to
account for the very slight signs                  of
                                           tension which were deve
loped, although this objection would equally apply                the ex    to
periment        of
                Volta.
     Itappears      me rather extraordinary, considering the im

                of                                 no

trials     I foundthe following arrangement produce the effects
I  had   anticipated.
    Two plates, one of copper and the other of zinc, 4 inches in
diameter, were attached to the insulated glass pillars of my mi
crometer electrometer (Phil. Trans. 1840, p. 185); the plates
were carefully approximated to about Tºnth of an inch apart:
when thus adjusted, a copper wire was attached to each of the
plates, and also to the discs of the electroscope, which are fixed
at about one-eighth of an inch apart; the leaf of the electro
scope was raised so as to allow it to swing clear of the two discs,
and when not excited, to remain equidistant from each : thus ar
ranged, the apparatus is ready for the experiment. With one
hand the experimentalist holds a Zamboni’s pile so as to have
one of        its
             terminals within about      inch      the brass plate

286   Mr. Gassiot           on the relation   of Electrical           &   Chemical Actions
respecting the absence of any notable degree of it in the bat
       I
teries described #; for instance, I proved that, with 320 series
of Prof. Daniell's constant battery, polar tension was not
evinced adequate to the striking distance of rºuth of an inch;
           I
nor was more successful in obtaining it with a water battery
of 1024 seriest, constructed by the same gentleman. I also
stated that, according to the present theoretical views of the
action of the voltaic battery, with the apparatus I then used,
it ought to have taken place; and that, if by a still more pow
erful apparatus it could not be obtained, the theory must, in
some way or other, be incorrect.
    2. The preceding negative facts are not without their value
in a scientific point of view; they show us, at least, a certain
limit within which the anticipated effects could not be obtained.
At the same time I could not fail to admit that they were any
thing but conclusive, as to the actual question of the possibility
of obtaining the spark before the circuit was completed. That
I  am justified in calling the spark, under such circumstances,
an anticipated effect, may be fairly assumed, because every
electrician is aware that the terminals of a voltaic series                                in
variably evince a certain amount of tensionf; and as spark is
but a consequence of tension exalted to a maximum, it is only
fair to anticipate that, by increasing the tension, it would be
obtained.
    3. A short time after the publication of the paper to which
I  have alluded, a communication reached me from my friend
Mr. Crosse, of Broomfield, Somersetshire, wherein he stated
º
that, with 1626 cells of copper and zinc, excited with river
water, he had succeeded in obtaining a spark between slips of
tinfoil pasted on sealing-wax.      This communication I imme
         forwarded for publication in the Philosophical
                                                    -

zine for   September   1840.
    4. I was at that time engaged in the construction of an ex
tensive series of the water battery; but, from the difficulties
of insulation, which continually presented themselves, consi
derable time elapsed before the battery was in a condition to
afford results, on which any dependence could be placed.
Having, at length, to a certain extent, surmounted these diffi
culties, I have been enabled especially to study the character

establish the fact, beyond any doubt, of not only the passing of
a distinct spark before the completion of the circuit, but the
practicability of continuing this action for several weeks in
constant succession, and enabling us to examine, with much
accuracy, the rationale of the action of this extraordinary ap
paratus.
    5.  The  water battery,   which I have constructed, and which
I   am about to describe, consists of 3520 pairs, or series of
copper and zinc cylinders, each pair being placed in a sepa
rate glass vessel, well covered with a coating of lac varnish.
The glass cells are placed on slips of glass, covered on both
sides with a thick coating of lac; this coating being fixed by
heating the glass over a gas furnace, and then covering it with
the varnish.      The 3520 cells, thus insulated, are placed on
forty-four separate oaken boards, also covered with lac varnish,
each board carrying eighty cells. The boards, or trays, slide
into a wooden frame, where they are further insulated by rest
 ing on pieces of thick plate glass, similarly varnished.
     6. It may at first sight appear that many of these precau
 tions are unnecessary; in truth, had I, at the outset, expected
 they would have been requisite,      I  might probably have been
 deterred from attempting so troublesome and lengthened an
 inquiry.     At first I imitated the apparatus of Mr. Crosse, al
 ready referred to (3.), the copper cylinders being made water
 tight that they might themselves constitute the cells; and consi
 dering such insulation would be sufficient, I attached the cells
 to the boards with sealing-wax, poured into holes made in the
  boards for the insertion of each cell.   I found this arrangement
  answer very well for a few hundred series, but when the number
  was augmented, and the battery completed, the insulation was
  sadly deficient. This induced me to take the battery asunder,
  and to have distinct or separate glass vessels made for each
  pair.   After again completing the entire series,      I found the
  insulation was even less efficient than before; for from the
  glass attracting moisture from the atmosphere, as well as from
  the evaporation of the battery, each cell became a conductor,
  and scarcely any effect could be produced on the electroscope;
  in fact, it was not until I had finally adopted the arrange
  ments   I have previously described, that any approximation to
  a tolerable insulation could be maintained.
      7. The general appearance of the battery may be seen by
  referring to fig. 1, where A, A' represent the wooden frames,
  in which are placed the forty-four boards containing the entire
  battery; B a shelf on which a galvanometer can be placed, or
  any other apparatus for the detection of a current or chemical
   action. N and P are the terminals or poles of the battery.

     10.       We know, from                  the very earliest experiments, that the
extremities         voltaic pile present opposite electrical states;

                                                                 to

degree       electric tension, and that the gold leaves diverge
                of
with considerable energy. Indeed,              the battery above de   in
scribed, there was little need         making connection with the
                                                            of
ground; for, with                      all
                           my precautions,       found the insulation I
was        short time very imperfect, and that,
          ina                                            this commu                  by
nication with the earth, complete circuit,    a        certain extent,          to   a
already existed.
    11. As the static effects present themselves antecedently                                             to
the dynamic, they necessarily demand the first notice. The
entire battery was connected           one series, and copper wires
                                                          in

considerable and steady divergence            the gold leaves; and,of
on   applying the usual tests, the plate          connected with the       b,
copper extremity, gave signs            vitreous, and       of

                 not with the ground, the same general effects
occurred; the divergence          the leaves corresponded with the

   19. This experiment was, however, of too much importance
to be passed over without adopting every means of making it
unexceptionable.    Two trays from the battery, being a series
of 160 cells, were removed and insulated, by being supported
on stout varnished glass pillars twelve inches high; the whole
being placed upon an Arnott's stove in which a fire had been
kept burning for several hours. The galvanometer was                                                   in
terposed between the zinc terminal of one tray and the copper
terminal of the other; and the extremities of this reduced
series were arranged so as to exhibit the same effects of elec
tric tension which we have seen in the entire series; but not
the slightest indication of dynamic action could be detected
by the galvanometer. The action of the instrument I used
could not be in fault; and some idea may be conceived of                                               its

   22. Faraday”, in the course of that branch of his experi
mental researches which introduced into notice the voltameter,
established the most accurate means of measuring the amount
of chemical action in the battery cells, by the equivalent
amount of chemical decomposition exhibited in that instru
ment; he has also directed our attention to the fact, that this
amount of electro-chemical decomposition depends essentially
on the current as denoted by the galvanometer. There was
every reason, with these facts before us, to expect that the
battery, which did not produce a current, would not evince
any degree of chemical decomposition.         Recourse was, how
ever, had to the test of experiment; and, instead of introdu
cing the galvanometer,                  I
                              substituted for it a small piece of
bibulous   paper,  saturated with a solution of iodide of potas
sium; the gold leaves of the electroscope diverged as before,
but, however long the duration of action, not the least indica
tion of the liberation of iodine was perceptible.      The infer
ence I make from this                  is,
                             that no definite chemical action took
place  in   any cell         of
                         the battery, and consequently that the
electric effects above shown, and which are termed static effects,
take place before          or

294          Mr. Gassiot     on the relation    of Electrical & Chemical Actions
labours of Faraday have, moreover, added powerful argu
ments in favour of this theory; but it must be acknowledged
that it is not easy to defend it when we advert to electricity of
tension developed in the contact of two heterogeneous bodies,
especially if the two bodies are solid.”
    Faraday#, who has recently instituted a series of elaborate
researches in support of the chemical theory, writes thus of
it:-"The theory assumes that the particles of the di-electric
 (now an electrolyte) are, in the first instance, brought by or
dinary induction into a polarized state, and raised to a certain
degree of tension or intensity before discharge commences,
the inductive state being in fact a necessary preliminary to dis
charge.”       Again, “One point                 is,
                                            that different electrolytes                           or
di-electrics    require  different initial intensities for their decom
position.     This may depend upon the degree                   polarization
                                                                         of
which the particles require before electrolytic discharge com
mencest.”

  whether contact      produces     current,   but whether           produces                  it
  electric  development,    and whether that      development          accom                        is
  panied    by any chemical action; and this necessarily involves
  the question, whether the effects           current,      ofthose usually         or
  called voltaic, have the same efficient cause                 the electro              as

    28. Marianini went through              series  a   experiments,   of                        in
which   he  found that      in    no
                                case was tension actually destroyed;
but that  it  fell  in proportion            to

 electricity   of tension.
    29. For this purpose the following experiments were made:
a   copper wire attached           to   the battery was connected with
                                        N    of
 the galvanometer, and this with the plate               the double elec
                                                                   a
                                                                   of
 troscope, fig.     4.     platinum wire was attached
                         of A                                            the       to  P    of
 battery, the end        which rested           piece  on bibulous paper of
                                                         of a
                                               potassium: another pla
 saturated with       solution       on of
                                    iodide
                    a
 tinum wire, also resting          the paper, was connected with the
                                         Fig.       7.
other plate    b    of    the   electroscope;            by      the   mechanical arrange

        before and after completion   of the Voltaic Circuit.         297
ment   of this instrument, the plates could be approximated or
separated as required. Fig. 7 shows the arrangement; N and
P, the terminals of the battery; G, the galvanometer; a and
b, the plates of the electroscope; S, solution of iodide of po
tassium.
   30. When the plates a and b were approximated so as to
permit sparks to pass at intervals of about a second, a tremu
lous motion was imparted to the needle; but when they were
brought so nearly in contact as to permit the discharges to
take place in quick succession, the needle was steadily de
flected, and iodine freely evolved; proving that chemical action
was occurring in each cell, and that the current is a collection
or an accumulation of discharges of electricity of tension; for
although the circuit was completed by distinct and separate
discharges, still the deflection of the needle was as steady as
if the discs had been in actual metallic contact.
  31.   The discs a and      b were then   separated   to the distance
of about an inch; a piece of tinfoil was suspended by means
of a thread of white silk; the tinfoil vibrated between the
plates, but no effect could be produced on iodide of potassium
or on the galvanometer.
   32. I have already alluded to the extreme difficulty I expe
rienced in effecting perfect insulation.   I was anxious to as
certain whether this insulation, and at the same time a high
state of intensity, could be obtained, and whether, in such a
state, any evidence of chemical action could be detected when
one end of the battery was in connection with the ground.
                     I
After many trials, succeeded in insulating 320 cells; and so
efficient was even this reduced number in point of intensity,
that sparks could be obtained by means of the micrometer
electrometer through a space of Trºuth of an inch. The ends
of two platinum wires were then fixed so as to rest on a piece
of bibulous paper saturated with a solution of iodide of potas
sium. One of the wires was connected at one time with the
copper, and at another time with the zinc terminal of the bat
tery; while the wire attached to the other extremity was con
nected with the earth. This arrangement being continued for
several hours, and the paper kept constantly moist, not the
slightest evidence of any evolution of iodine could be detected,
until by a momentary contact made with the further extremity
of the battery and the ground, either by a wire, or by touch
ing it with the hand, the circuit was completed. Here we
have a voltaic battery the intensity of which is sufficient to
elicit a spark between       its
                            terminals before the circuit   com   is
pleted, but   inwhich antecedent thereto, the slightest chemical
action  is not appreciable; and this when one end           con
                                                            is   in

  exalted to a maximum short of actual discharge.

the gases used in this battery are oxygen and hydrogen (which
will from their affinity for each other enter into chemical com
bination), a series of ten or twelve is sufficient to develope
static effects; but that, when charged with gases which have
not this power, viz. oxygen and nitrogen, even a series of forty
does not affect the electroscope.

scribed in this paper are as follows:—

sume polar tension before the circuit is complete (10.1.1. 15.)
even in a single cell (45.); and that the existence of this polar
state is demonstrated by the action on the electroscope being
different at each terminal of the battery.
    2nd. That this tension, when exalted by a series of pairs,
is  such,   that a succession of sparks will pass between the ter
minals of the battery before their actual contact (16.32.).
     3rd. That these static effects precede, and are independent
as of,the completion                   of
                           the voltaic circuit (10. 11. 17.),    well                        as

   Note.—I have recently constructed an instrument, by means
of which the tension in a single series of the voltaic battery
can with facility be tested without the aid of Zamboni's pile.
 Fig. 8 represents the electroscope, in the construction of which
I  was in a great measure indebted to an apparatus described
by Dr. Hare+.       A is a glass vessel,
the stem of which is well-coated with
lac; B, B, two copper wires passing
through glass tubes and corks; D,
D', gilt discs, each about two inches
diameter, attached to the wires; P,
a copper plate with a wire passing
 through a glass tube; to the end of
the wire is attached a narrow strip of
gold leaf, L. The discs must be ad
justed with care, so as to allow the
leaf to be equidistant from each. If B is connected by a wire
attached to the platinum, and B' by another wire attached to
 the zinc of a single cell of the nitric acid battery, insulated on
a plate of lac, and an excited glass rod is approximated very
gradually towards the plate P, the gold leaf will be attracted
 to B', or the disc attached to the zinc.; and if excited resin is
 approximated in a similar manner, the leaf is then attracted to
 B, or the disc attached to the platinum. By means of this                          in
 strument, my friend, the Rev. Charles Pritchard, obtained
 signs of tension in a single cell excited by dilute sulphuric
 acid with platinum and zinc. This experiment                     I
                                                        subsequently
 verified, and obtained similar results with    single cells of other
                                                              the ex

 usual arrangements of the voltaic       battery;  but in
 periments    Imade, the higher the chemical affinities      the ele
 ments used, the greater was the development                     of
                                                        the evidence
 of tension.

burgh, with a request that those gentlemen would kindly undertake
the necessary superintendence of the work; a request which they
acceded to with alacrity; and the obelisk, in packing cases, arrived
in Table Bay in the month of August 1841, where it was safely
landed under the guidance of Colonel Lewis.
   The following is the report of Colonel Lewis on the erection  :-
    “In excavating the foundation, which was of black sand, it was
found necessary to go down 4 feet 10 inches to arrive at the iron
stone gravelly bed, the substratum of the country about Feldhausen.
The masonry foundation was formed of concrete, built up in courses
of 12 or 14 inches, and composed of iron-stone, gravel, and lime
mortar, well grouted together.    On this masonry bed a granite plat
form 9 feet 6 inches square was laid, and the small column fixed by
Sir John Herschel on the site of the 20-feet reflector. This mark
was removed for a few days, in order to bring the masonry founda
tion to a proper height, but the mark was relaid with mathematical
correctness by Lieut. Laffau, Royal Engineers.
    “Previously, however, to relaying the Herschel mark, the sugges
tion of the committee of construction was adopted of placing under
it several silver and copper coins, a few inscription medals, and
medals of the South African Institution, struck in silver for the oc
casion ; and on the obverse were engraved some notices, statistical
and geographical, of the colony; the discoveries of Capt. Ross in
the South Polar Regions in 1841; and the operation of remeasuring
the arc of the meridian in 1842.      These subjects were beautifully
executed by Mr. Piazzi Smyth, assistant-astronomer, and hermeti
cally sealed in glass bottles. Also there were deposited a map of
the colony and engravings of nebulae observed at Slough from 1825
to 1833, by Sir John Herschel, and a plan of Mr. Maclear's triangu
lation connecting the site of Feldhausen with the Royal Observa
tory and the site of Lacaille's observatory, in Strand Street, Cape
Town.
    “The bottle was carefully fixed in a block of teak-wood, scooped
out on purpose.
    “When the granite platform was brought to its level, and the
 Herschel mark refixed and filled in with cement, it was necessary to
erect heavy shears of large spars, to place the stones of the obelisk
 composed of large blocks of Craigleith stone, some weighing two
tons, sent from Scotland by Professors Forbes and Henderson, who
kindly took this charge. This was accomplished with some trouble
and expense, and the base of the obelisk was laid with the faces cor
 responding with the four cardinal points. The whole was completed
 on the 15th of February, 1842, in presence of some of the Commit
 tee and several of the subscribers and friends of Sir John Herschel,
who attended on the occasion of placing the top stone of the obelisk.
    “The obelisk has the base 6 feet square by 6 feet in height, and
the pyramidal part stands 12 feet above the base.     On the east face

is   an opening showing the Herschel   mark, designating the site of
the 20-feet reflector. The    opening  will be closed with a bronze
plate, containing the inscription of the purpose for which the obe
lisk is erected.”
   VI. On Loud Beats of Clocks used in Observatories. By J. S.
Eiffe, Esq.
   This paper gives an explanation of a simple and easily applied
method of obtaining very loud beats for the astronomical clock.
The author alludes to the difficulty which has been hitherto experi
enced in obtaining any sound in the beat of astronomical clocks at
all approaching that which is necessary for distinctness under ordi
nary circumstances. He then adverts to the necessary irregularities
in the clocks of the ordinary construction, arising from the large
ness and imperfection of the workmanship of the brass-work, and
hints at a method which he has devised, whereby the present large
circle of seconds can be retained with a small and delicate move
ment, such as those used in marine chronometers, and without any
intermediate wheel.
    But without a method to enable the observer to increase at plea
 sure the loudness of the beats, it is manifest that the beats of such
 a clock would not be loud enough for the ordinary purposes of an
 observatory; and the author's invention, described in the present
 paper, is intended to supply this deficiency by the introduction of an
 apparatus to produce loud beats simultaneously with the escape of
 the seconds' wheel from one pallet to the other, which is totally                                    in
 dependent of the size and weight of metal of the works of the clock.
 The mode of constructing the apparatus is as follows:—
    Two pieces of thin brass are placed at the sides of the frame
 work of the clock, in length the same as the space between the pil
 lars; in width, about two inches or more at pleasure; these pieces
 of brass are placed horizontally, at about the same altitude from the
 base as the axis of the escape-wheel pinion, and at right angles to
it,   ornearly so.       They should      made      be
                                                    such size  of    would en
                                                                         a               as
          sound, distinct, sharp, and short. The little tables can
                                                                                                       or be
 sure  a
 made      to any size,             as
                                 mentioned above.
                                         is             Upon these tables
 plates two hammers ply, supported by arbors                         at
                                                           the same elevation
 as all the others. The pivots should                     be
                                                 made small for easy motion.
 The hammers are intended              beat upon the middle
                                               to                    each brass          of

 been  observed,     that the arbors which    support    those little hammers
 are placed         at                                        the brass frame

mers beat upon the plates or tables at one end, and at the other the
lifting action takes place, assisted by the passing spring. The strokes
 upon these brass tables have a peculiar sharpness of tone, which
 can be accounted for in some measure, when it is considered that
 they are very different from the sounds produced by the teeth of the
 wheel itself; in the dead-beat escapement the teeth have a sliding
 motion in the moment of drop, but not impulse, for it is well known
 that that is subsequent to the sound. The exertions to obtain sound
 have for some years been considerable; but the result has been a
 poor recompense, and unimportant after all. Thus then, and by
 such application, simple and easy to be understood, is it proposed
 to obtain sound, so loud as to be distinct in the stormiest night; but
 as the constant connexion of such apparatus would neither be de
 sirable as concerns the action of the clock, nor pleasant to the ear
 as a companion, a mode has been introduced of readily detaching it
 altogether.    By a certain method, which shall be explained, the
 hammers are raised from the tables at one end, and the arms at the
 other entirely disengaged from the anchor of the pallet, without the
 least inconvenience or disturbing action to the clock itself. This is
 very pleasing, and greatly to be desired, and perhaps may be consi
 dered of nearly equal importance with the invention itself by which
 a loud beat is obtained. The apparatus within is immediately, and
 at pleasure, acted upon through the agency of a bolt, which is placed
 vertically, immediately over the 60 minutes, or about two inches back,
 sufficiently long to reach a spring of hard brass, which is about half
 an inch wide, and which passes transversely over the frame-work of
 the clock, and is fixed securely to the back board of the clock-case.
 Now the mode in which the spring unites its action with the rest
 of the apparatus is by slight cross-bars, which extend to the ex
 tremities of the sides of the frame, so that the ends are immediately
 over the hammers, with which they are connected by silk threads.
 Therefore, by pressing down the bolt before named, the hammers
 are allowed to fall into action, and do their duty simultaneously with
 the teeth of the wheel upon the pallets.      While the little hammers
 are in action, the teeth of the wheel are no longer heard, and the
 motion and view of the seconds' hand, as well as the ear of the     in
 quirer, will satisfy him as to the usefulness of the invention.
    In conclusion, and to endeavour to dispel any doubts that may
 arise as to the probable advantages to be obtained by such assistance
to the observatory, the opinion and satisfaction expressed by word
and by letter, on those advantages, by the distinguished individual who
is at the head of our national observatory, will, it cannot be doubted,
be interesting to this learned Society.      The Astronomer Royal de
clares by letter, that he has examined the plan, and is enabled to
say that it answers completely for its proposed purpose ; and that it
appears likely to be very useful; moreover, that the rate of the
clock will not necessarily be disturbed during the time of its con
nexion—though that will greatly depend on certain conditions.

L. and E., Professor of Practical Astronomy in the University of
Edinburgh.
   This catalogue contains the right ascensions of 174 principal fixed
stars, reduced to January 1, 1833; being the same stars of which
the declinations, observed by Mr. Henderson at the Cape, are pub
lished in vol. x. of the Memoirs, with the addition of 4° Eridani,
a Persei, and 6 Ursae Majoris. The observations of right ascension
(with the exception of a small number) were made by the assistant
astronomer, Lieutenant William Meadows, R.N.         The transit in
strument, by Dollond, is 9 feet 9% inches in focal length, with an
object-glass of 5 inches in diameter. The magnifying powers em
ployed were 88 and 132; chiefly the latter.       The clock was by
Hardy, having one of his scapements, and a mercurial compensation
pendulum.    During the period of the observations    rate was                          its                as

        Observations on the Appearance of the Comet of 1843, made
at  Cape  Coast Castle, on the Coast of Africa. By G. Maclean, Esq.,
President of the Colony. Communicated by Captain Beaufort, R.N.,
Hydrographer to the Admiralty”.
   The comet was first seen at Cape Coast Castle on the evening of
Friday, the 3rd of March, at about a quarter to seven.                   Part of its
tail only was then visible, bearing W.S.W., and making an angle of
about 70° with the horizon, towards the south. It was of the same

    “The observatory at Alten, as you are aware, is the most northern
in the world. We shall very shortly commence the series of prepa
ratory transit observations you suggest. We had intended to have
done so before ; but the cold, since the sun revisited us on the 2nd
instant, has been so intense that we have not been able; the eye was
no sooner brought near the glass than the latter was covered with a
coating of ice. It was even dangerous to touch the metal. The
thermometer has been varying from 24° to 28° below zero of Celsius,

   I. Some remarks on the Telescopic Appearance of the Moon, ac
companying a Model and a Drawing of a Portion of her Surface.
By James Nasmyth, Esq.
   The model and drawing submitted to the Society by the author,
represent a portion of the moon's surface of 190 by 160 miles, situ
ated in the upper part of her left limb as seen in an inverting tele
scope, having in the centre the large crater marked in the Berlin
chart No. 29, and named “Maurolicus.”
   The scale of the drawing is one-eighth of an inch to a mile. The
telescopes employed were two Newtonian reflectors, one of Slinches
aperture, and 9 feet focallength, and the other of 12 inches aperture,
and 13 feet focal length, the powers employed being 240 and 360.
The author has, for the last four years, confined his attention almost
exclusively to the nature and structure of the lunar disc, and he se
lected the portion above mentioned as a subject for a model by reason
of its comprising in a small space most of the chief features which
so remarkably distinguish her surface.
   The model was constructed with a view of illustrating the close
relationship which appears to exist between the structure of the lunar
surface and that of a considerable portion of the earth, in regard to
the similarity in the results of vast volcanic action.
   The author, in reference to the nature of the peculiarities of the
surface of the moon, first remarks on the vast size of the lunar cra
ters as compared with those on the surface of the earth. Of these
there exist some of the enormous magnitude of 150 miles in diame
ter, besides other circular formations, such as the “Mare Serenitatis,”
and “Mare Crisium,” which are from 200 to 300 miles in diameter,
and which evidently owe their form to volcanic action of prodigious
central energy. This enormous effect, compared with that of vol
canic agency on the earth's surface, will appear less surprising when
we consider that the mass of the moon is scarcely the ºth part of
that of the earth, and that, consequently, the weight of the materials
acted on by the volcanic force is diminished very considerably com
pared with bodies on the earth's surface: the probable want of atmo
spheric resistance will also assist in accounting for the immensely
greater effects produced. The beautiful and almost perfectly circu
lar form of the majority of the lunar craters may be due to the ab
sence of wind or other disturbing causes, permitting the discharged
materials to perform the course due to the impulse comparatively free
from  all impediment.
   There are several portions   of  the moon's surface which indicate
                                                                           of of

Mr.        J. Nasmyth     on the Telescopic Appearance      of the Moon. 311
crater and that of another, this being proved by the fact of the cir
cular mound of the one overlaying that of the other.       [The author
here introduces a pen sketch illustrating this remark.]
   Next to the circular form of the craters, the author considers that
there is no feature more striking than the small cones or mounds
which we observe in the centre of most of the craters. These he
considers to be the result of the last expiring efforts of the volcanic
action, as we find it to be the case in Vesuvius and other terrestrial
volcanoes. Other cases exist in which there is no such central cone;
 but these may have resulted from the more sudden termination of
 the volcanic action which had permitted the fluid sooner to float
 across the bottom of the crater, and to form that plain, smooth sur
 face which may be seen in a few cases.          One has been, however,
 observed  by  the author in the     upper  part of the right limb of the
 moon, in which the lava had apparently kept flowing up so gently
 to the last as to leave the crater brim-full.    [This is illustrated by a
 pen drawing.]     The ruts or channels which may be distinctly ob
 served in the sides or banks of the outside circular mounds, and which
 frequently extend to a considerable distance, prove that the matter
 discharged has not been entirely of a solid nature. Blocks of solid
 materials also appear to have been discharged with vast force and in
 vast quantity. They may, in many cases, be observed lying about
 the bases of the larger craters, where the surface is rendered quite
rough by the quantity of such detached fragments.
    The last peculiarity adverted to by the author consists in the
bright lines which generally converge to a centre, and in which we
frequently find a crater of very considerable magnitude.          “Tycho,”
“Copernicus,” and “Kepler,” are remarkable examples of this ap
pearance. The material of these bright lines is evidently of a much
more reflective nature than the contiguous or general surface of the
moon, and in most cases the interior of the crater to which they
converge is equally resplendent. The author considers them to be
derived from the same original cause which produced the central
volcano from which they appear to diverge.         It appears to him that
they are produced by the flow of the molten lava through the vast
cracks resulting from the great primary upheaving action which had
burst upwards the solid surface of the moon, cracking it as a pane
of glass does when broken by any pointed object. The centre of
disruption has evidently been under the great central volcano. The
cracks have diverged on                all
                               sides from this centre     action; and the
                                                            of
molten lava immediately flowing up would come forth                  greatest
                                                                          in
quantity from the centre, and there result         and produce the great
                                                       in

taneously     all
              along their course, however extended.

est imaginable quantity of being totally eclipsed here. The corona
was very faint and of a greenish-yellow colour, occasioned doubtless
by seeing it through a very thin film of smoke, for the total removal
of the darkening shade had not been provided for. It was never quite
dark, or too dark to read off the actinometer: Venus, Saturn, and
Arcturus were seen by the author's servants, who had been instructed
to watch for stars.      Mr. Caldecott saw nothing of the luminous
protuberances noticed by Mr. Baily and Mr. Airy", but the greatest
obscuration was so momentary in this eclipse, that there was no time
for the eye to give more than a glance round the disc before the sun
and moon were again separating, and strong light was restored.
Shortly after 9" A.M. the author took another set of altitudes of the
upper limb of the sun, and the appearances during the separation of
the two bodies were observed every few minutes, but nothing worthy
of remark was seen. The actinometer readings and the resulting
radiation are given in an accompanying table, together with some
occasional readings of a thermometer taken at irregular intervals du
ring the progress of the eclipse. The impression on Mr. Caldecott's
mind   is,that the beads are the effect          the incessantly varying re

 occultations, which I have found useful in drawing the attention of
 some    of my pupils to this valuable method of determining meridian
 distance.
     “The prediction of the time is almost an essential preliminary to
 the observation, and the computation required for this, in the usual
 way, is such as to put it altogether beyond the reach of many who
 would otherwise be perfectly able and willing to make the observa
 tion, and who have many valuable opportunities in the course of their
 profession of improving geography by such means.                The method is
 simply delineating the essential points in the orthographical projec
 tion of the moon's motion and that of the observer in a plane per
pendicular to the direction of the star. This is simplified to the ut
most by means of scales, and I find that, with a little practice, my
pupils have no difficulty in predicting the time of observation to 1 or
 1# minute, and this without much care being taken in the drawing.
From several occultations, which I predicted and observed here, and
from numerous examples taken from the Astronomical Society's
Transactions, I find that, with ordinary care, the predicted time may
be depended upon within one minute, and that the time occupied in
doing so varies from 10 to 15 minutes. As this is sufficiently near

tacle of a definite portion of the tail being deflected from the axis,
or direction in which the general body of light continued to proceed.
Perhaps about one-sixth of the train might be thus drawn aside
from that which may be termed the natural direction, so as to form
therewith, at the point of separation, an angle which I should calcu
late to be about three degress. . . . Five-sixths of the whole body of
light continued without interruption in the ordinary direction, the
 remainder deviating from it in the manner here stated.”

of gold in five times their weight of aqua regia, prepared from four
parts of hydrochloric acid and one part of nitric acid; evaporate the
solution almost to dryness; this evaporation is requisite to get rid of
the acid. The chloride of gold being redissolved in water and fil
tered, the solution is to be diluted till it measures 26 ounces; frag

 ON     THE OXIDES AND SOME OTHER COMPOUNDS OF GOLD.                                                      BY

chloride of gold at a boiling heat with bicarbonate of potash, till
effervescence ceases: 2nd, by precipitation with magnesia, as recom
mended by Pelletier.     The first of these processes, as it is generally
effected in the  laboratory,  yields but a very small quantity of the
oxide, for an excess of the alkaline salt readily redissolves the oxide
of gold precipitated, forming a double chloride of gold and potassium
and aurate of potash. The magnesia process succeeds much better,
though it is tedious, and a considerable quantity of the metal is con
verted into chloride of gold and magnesium.
   M. Figuier prefers the following process:–precipitate the solution
of gold by carbonate of soda, and convert afterwards the small quan
tity of gold which remains in the liquors, into aurate of soda, which
is to be afterwards decomposed by sulphuric acid, so as to set the
auric acid free: the following is M. Figuier's description of the pro
cess        :--
   Evaporate the common solution of gold nearly to dryness, redis
solving with a few drops of aqua regia the light deposit of proto
chloride of gold, which always remains by the action of the heat.
Dissolve the chloride in water, and saturate the brown solution which
remains very accurately with carbonate of soda, either dissolved or
solid, and as free as possible from chloride, to prevent the formation
of the double chloride of sodium and gold. The liquor is to be made
to boil, preserving                its
                           neutrality very exactly.                    boiled forIt   is

  the latter of which sublimes at 563°F.              If the salt be rapidly heated,
 it   decomposes  suddenly,   and chlorine is one of the products.            When

 water, oxygen and chlorine.        When the heat has been sufficiently
 great, the residue is a gray fused mass, formed of a mixture of oxide
 and chloride of cadmium ; if this residue be treated with water, it

Double sulph ATE of PRotoxide AND SESQUIoxi DE OF IRoN.
                        BY M. J. A. POUMAREDE.
  When a mixture of two parts of protosulphate of iron and two
parts of persulphate of iron, theoretically neutral, is treated with five
or six parts of distilled water, it is found, after a contact of fifteen to
twenty minutes, that the mixture becomes considerably warm, ac
quiring a temperature of 77° to 86°Fahr. above that of the surround
ing air. In addition to this the two salts are found to dissolve en
tirely, yielding a perfectly bright brown liquor, which becomes a
crystalline mass by proper evaporation.
   There are two remarkable facts to be noticed in the reaction above
described: first, the increased temperature of the mixture; secondly,
the solution of two salts, of limited solubility, to an enormous extent
in a small quantity of water, and these are characteristics of chemical
action; the new salt crystallizes in long slender crystals; they have
a very pale green colour, a slightly styptic taste, and a very distinct
sweet after-taste.
   By long exposure to the air this salt is covered with subsulphate
of peroxide; but the tendency to peroxidize appears to be less than
that of the protosalts of iron; when heated it fuses readily, loses its
water of crystallization, afterwards the acid of the persulphate, and
at a still higher temperature it yields       the products obtained by         all
decomposing the protosulphate       water dissolves         ;proportions.                     it    in       all

LI.     Evamination of a yellow substance from India called
     Purree, from which the pigment called Indian Yellow is
     manufactured. By John STENHouse, Ph.D.*
PURREE,          the substance from which the well-known pig
        ment, Indian yellow, is made, is imported into Great
 Britain in considerable quantity from various parts of India
and China. As usually met with in commerce, purree con
sists of balls of from three to four ounces in weight, which are
dark brown externally, but when broken up their interior has
a deep orange colour.        When viewed under the microscope,
they evidently consist of small needle-shaped crystals. Purree
has a very peculiar smell, very closely resembling that of
castor. This circumstance has induced the belief that it is an
animal matter, and it is generally regarded, even by those best
acquainted with the East, as consisting of bezoars from the
  all-bladders of different animals, such as the Camel, the Ele
phant, the Buffalo, &c. Another prevalent opinion                that              is,       it
isa   deposit from the urine        some of             of
                                               these animals.     From
reasons which will presently appear, am induced         I       believe            to
that purree has        vegetable and not
                        a                        animal origin. My

322      Dr. Stenhouse's   Examination of Purree, the substance
which chiefly consist of magnesia.        The ashes also contain
some potash in the state of carbonate, and a little lime, but no
   hosphoric acid. Purree dissolves very readily in most acids.
    he one which    I usually employed was the acetic, in which,
when assisted by heat, it is exceedingly soluble. The colour
of the solution is a deep reddish-brown; on cooling it depo
sits a quantity of dark brown flocks, and on standing for a few
days a quantity of deep yellow crystals arranged in small stars
appear in the liquid, the taste of which is exceedingly nauseous.
The most convenient way of obtaining these crystals in a pure
state is the following:—
     Dissolve the purree, cut into small pieces, in boiling water
containing a considerable quantity of acetic acid, and filter
the liquid to remove the insoluble matter, which consists
chiefly of dark brown flocks and of some other impurities.
 The clear liquid is to be treated with a solution of acetate of
 lead so long as it occasions a precipitate, which is very bulky
 and has a brownish-yellow colour.       The precipitate is to be
 collected and washed with cold water, and to be decomposed
 by sulphuretted hydrogen; it is then to be repeatedly boiled
 with spirits of wine, in which the yellow crystals are pretty
 soluble.     On the cooling of the liquid the crystals are depo
 sited in  great  quantity; they are long flat needles arranged in
 stars, and have a deep yellow colour and considerable lustre.
 They redden litmus pretty strongly, and consist of a vegetable
 acid united in the crude substance (purree) with magnesia.
  They are still far from pure, and retain a considerable quan
  tity of magnesia, from which it is extremely difficult to free
  them. The crystals should then be dissolved in a hot solution
  of carbonate of soda and filtered. When the solution is neu
  tralized with muriatic acid, they are again deposited on the
  cooling of the liquid. The crystals should be collected, washed
  with cold water, in which they are very slightly soluble, to re
  move adhering muriatic acid, and dried by pressure.         They
  should   again be dissolved in hot water and be   precipitated by
  acetate of lead. The lead salt should then be decomposed by sul
  phuretted hydrogen, and the crystals dissolved out by hot spi
  rits of wine. The crystals have now only a faint shade of yellow,
  and are to be still further purified by being five or six times
  crystallized from spirits of wine. They are then almost en
  tirely pure, though on being burned on platinum foil they still
  leave a mere trace of magnesia, so small as to be scarcely per
  ceptible. I was not able to remove this minute portion of mag
  nesia, even by repeatedly crystallizing the acid from aether.

       These analyses appear therefore to give C20 H9 Oll as
    the formula of the acid to which I shall give the provisional

    dissolves pretty readily in boiling water, from which it is de

    From these analyses it is evident that the oxide of lead has
united with the acid without removing an atom of water, as is
usually the case, unless with very feeble acids. The calculated
atomic weight of the acid from this salt is 2712, and the num
ber found is 2662.         Purreic acid forms only one salt with
lead, as the same compound was also obtained when subace
tate of lead was employed.
    When purreic acid is heated considerably above 212°F. it
melts, and if the heat is still further increased it begins to sub
lime. The best way of obtaining this sublimate in bright
yellow crystals of from 1 to 14 inch long, is cautiously to
heat pretty strongly a quantity of the impure acid in Mohr's
 subliming apparatus. A very large proportion of the acid is
charred, but a quantity of fine large crystals may be readily
procured, attached for the most part to the under side of the
 diaphragm. These crystals are not purreic acid, but a neutral
body which does not redden litmus.          It is but slightly soluble
in either acid or alkaline solutions, or in water, alcohol or
 aether. Its alcoholic solution does not precipitate neutral ace
tate of lead, nitrate of silver, or the chlorides of lime or ba
 rytes, but with basic acetate of lead it gives a yellow mucila
ginous precipitate.

     These numbers correspond pretty closely with the formula
C13 H4 O4. The substance is pretty difficult to burn, which
accounts for the deficiency of carbon in the first two analyses,
when oxide of copper was employed. I propose the provi
 sional name purrenone for this body, which in the mode of                                               its
 formation somewhat resembles alizarine, both being neutral
 bodies, obtained                    by
                         subliming feebly acid colouring matters.

      Two  different hypotheses may be made respecting the

               matter. This will                      be
                                       the case when the amplitudes

with the intervals between the material particles.             Hence it
appears that M. Cauchy’s equations are obtained, not only
upon the supposition that the relative motion of any two con

the distance between them, but also upon the assumption that
the amplitudes of the aethereal vibrations are extremely small
compared with the intervals between the particles of transpa

 328                     The Rev. Professor O’Brien              on the
Prof. MacCullagh has clearly shown that this statement must
 be received   with considerable limitation.   On the whole I
think we have    good  reason to doubt the correctness of the
first of the above hypotheses, both on the d priori ground
above stated, and because it appears to be capable of account
ing for little more than the dispersion of light.
    5. The second hypotheses has not yet been taken up by any
writer upon physical optics, so far as I am aware, but it is de
cidedly worthy of attention and leads to several important re
sults. The object of the present communication is simply to
 make a beginning in the application of this hypothesis to the
 explanation of optical phaenomena, and to show that it may
 possibly prove of much service in advancing the undulatory
 theory of light.
     Let us suppose then that the amplitudes of the aethereal                           vi
 brations are large compared with the intervals between the
 particles of transparent substances, and that consequently the
 motion of each element of the aethereal fluid is resisted by
 forces (the reactions of the material particles) which have this
 peculiarity, that they depend simply upon the state of motion
 of the element, but not upon                  its
                                          displacements from         equi      its
 librium   position.

fest from the fact, that the      impulse    given               to
                                                         the medium                     by

                                in
motion     of  particle.
               a           We may not therefore assume that the

medium produces no resistance along the normal of the path
of the particle: in fact, in the case of a particle describing a
very small oval with a small velocity, the principal resistance,
it seems to me, would be along the normal.
   7. From the consideration of a particle moving in a resist
ing medium, we may easily pass to the consideration of the re
sistance experienced by a moving fluid in which a great
number of fixed particles are immersed at regular intervals
from each other.        In such a case we must suppose that the
magnitude and direction of the resistance on any element of
the fluid depends upon the velocity of that element, the differ
ential coefficients of the velocity with respect to the time, and
the curvature of the path described by the element.                    We
must also,              I
                think, suppose that in general the resistance on
any element depends in some degree upon the state of motion
of the elements which surround               but,        it;
                                                     the particular case   in
where the state         motion varies very slowly
                                  of                        passing from               in
element       element (which will
                 to                       the only case we shall have

to  consider),      will not      necessary     be
                                                                   of to
                            it                   take this into account.
There will also                   be
                           certain amount
                                       a         internal agitation pro
duced      each element, which will depend upon the magnitude
           in
of  the resisting particles and the distances between them.
When the particles are placed                very small intervals from
                                                          at
each   other,  and their     magnitudes     are very small compared
with these   intervals,   this internal  agitation   will     inconsider                    be
able compared with the motion              translation   of  the element.              of

Also the amplitude of vibration will decrease as the wave ad

given by the equation
                                                                  (n +})}.
   The quantities              º   and
                                 are
                                     unknown, but they can vary
                                         +
only with n and the amplitude of vibration.          Experiment
shows that in   ordinary  cases,  where the light is of moderate
intensity, the velocity of propagation does not sensibly depend
upon the intensity”, and therefore we may conclude, from the
above expression for k, that                 s and T do not sensibly depend
upon the amplitude, and consequently vary only with n, when
the light is not intense.
   14. The application of these results to the general explana
tion of the dispersion and absorption of light is obvious; they
show that the velocity of propagation depends upon the co
lour, that light is weakened or absorbed in passing through
transparent substances, and that the degree of absorption is
different for different colours.
   15. It is worth remarking, that the absorption is produced
by the tangential resistance (T), for if we put
              If,
                                                      = 0 we find      T
h = 0.              on
                  the other hand,  we  suppose the normal resist
ance (N)      be zero, the above formulae for
              to                                   and     are not   h     k

                                                         a     not                  is

   16. So far we have assumed nothing respecting the resist
ances exercised by the particles                    of
                                        matter upon the aethereal
fluid beyond the existence       such forces; we shall now exa
                                             of
mine what consequences result from the supposition that the
resistances         do
                not sensibly interfere with the principle      the              of
superposition            of
                   small motions.

that the laws of propagation just obtained for circular vibra
tions are equally true for elliptical and rectilineal vibrations;
for, as is well known, we may produce elliptically or plane
polarized light by superposing two rays of circularly polarized
light.
   The second consequence is this, that

               s = n (C2 — C, n° + Con*...... &c.),
where C, C, Cs ...... &c. are constants independent of n and
of the amplitude of vibration.          I  shall reserve the proof of this
for  my   next  communication,        in which    I  shall also attempt an
explanation of the rotation of the plane of polarization pro
duced by certain liquids, the peculiar absorbing power of tour

 theoretical chemistry as a criterion for the determination of
 atomic weights.        Dulong and Petit, the philosophers who first
 announced that the specific heat of simple bodies is inversely
proportional to their atomic weights, proved their proposition
 by experiment in the case of several solid (chiefly metallic)
 bodies.     Subsequently several attempts have been made to
 discover the law of the specific heat of gases, liquids and com
 pound bodies. With regard to gases, Haycraftt, and subse
 quently De la Rive and Marceti, have attempted to prove that
 under the same pressure and volume all gases have the same
 specific heat. Unfortunately, the practical difficulty of ascer
 taining the specific heat of acriform fluids is so great, that consi
 derable uncertainty exists in the results obtained by the most
 skilful experimenters, and hence we find that the law of Hay
 craft, De la Rive and Marcet has failed to be confirmed by the

        DEAR SIR,
As many   hasty articles respecting the extraordinary quan

inserted in the papers, I send you the particulars of this phae

    August 9.-Night clear except a few wane clouds. The an
nual meteors began to appear tonight, but I only counted
seventeen of any considerable size.
    August 10.—Night clear.       I watched the meteors tonight
till near daybreak; they began to be visible at half-past 8
o'clock and continued without intermission             night, though           all

mentioned that “turnep seeds were sown, and every grain
germinated in the yellow and red rays—the greenest plants
were found in yellow light.” This is directly in opposition to
Mr. Hunt, who found in his experiments, “that the yellow
and red rays destroy the vital principle in the seed.”                 From
this circumstance there appears to be either some error on the
part of one of these gentlemen, or that some circumstances
have affected the experiments of the one which have not                                                      in
fluenced those of the other.            Dr. Gardner supposes the dif
ference to have arisen from the earth being rapidly dried in
the experiments of Mr. Hunt, which he considers sufficient
to retard or destroy germination.
     It appears to me that Dr. Gardner has overlooked one cir
cumstance in his experiments which seem strongly to militate
against the production of chlorophylle by yellow light, or else
to show that there is some error either in his experiments or
in the account which he has published of them; this                      that                          is,
the seeds       vegetables germinate most rapidly

 In   the paragraph referred                              he

 terms, whilst       giving the results
                       in                        the other experiments
                                                                of                                               in
 detail  he   mentions that seedling plants were operated upon.
 Now    we  know,   both from the observations              Ingenhousz and          of
 Sennebier,           as
                   well      from   daily
                                     as    experience,     that the absence
 of   solar light      one is             of
                                  the conditions almost necessary for
 the germination          seed, and consequently we should not ex
                                of
 pect that ray       which the maximum
                       in                            light    found   of faci            is            to
 litate  germination,    but       the  contrary,

 periments,       to
                  retard              it.
     This, however, not the only objection
                                is                          which this state        to

 which carbonic acid decomposed and chlorophylle produced,

 we should also expect that,           far from assisting

it  would exercise      highly
                            a    injurious   influence. We know that the

 also that this oxygen          absorbed, and
                                          is            uniting with     porin by                       a

   of Gold in the Brazilian Mines. By WILLIAM Jory HEN
   wood, C.E., F.R.S., F.G.S., Chief Commissioner of the
   Gongo Soco Gold Mines”.
THE     gold mine of Morro Velho is about 48 miles north
      west of the city of Ouro Preto and 10 miles south of
the town of Sabará: it has been worked by English compa
 nies for nearly sixteen years, but unsuccessfully until within
 three years past.
    It is situated on the flank of a mountain of considerable
 elevation; to the contour of which the metalliferous mass has
 an approximate parallelism, a circumstance of frequent occur
 rence in the gold formations of Brazil.
    a. The rock mostly consists of a dark lead-coloured clay
slate, and occasionally contains traces of chlorite, whilst there
are some layers of a dark brown colour, and others which are
quartzose and have a crystalline structure. The general bear
ing of the lamination is from N.E. to S.W., and the dip is
usually towards the S.E. from 40° to 70°. One series of joints
bears about E. and W., and another N. and S. (magnetic).
   b. The direction, dip, and dimensions of the mass from
which the gold is extracted are very irregular, and although
it has some characters in common with metalliferous veins
(lodes), it has others which more nearly resemble the forma
tions of tin ore at the Saint Ives Consolst, Rosewall Hillf,
and Balnoon). The accompanying ground plan is copied
from that used at the mine, and exhibits the peculiarities of
this formation more clearly than any description could do.
   The most westerly part of the mine is called the Champion
Ground, and consists of an assemblage of small veins; these
unite with the little Quebra Panella, which dips N. 70°–80°,

 being gradually replaced by quartzose and slaty substances
 towards the sides of the vein, much as in many Cornish mines”.
Joints also sometimes interveneandgive a deceptive appearance
of distinct demarcations (smooth walls) between them; in such
cases, however, the mineral composition is much alike on both
sides of the jointst.   On the upper side (hanging wall) of the
great Quebra Panella the pyrites and the adjoining slate mutu
ally penetrate each other, giving rise to a serrated appearance.
    e. The metallic minerals when brought to the surface are
spalled and stamped, as tin ores and the poorer copper ores
are in Cornwall; and the gold is afterwards separated from
the other ingredients by amalgamation.
   f. During the month of December 1843, the pyrites ex
tracted from the mine was 2.168 tons, and it yielded 110 troy lbs.
of gold, or about 292 grains of gold from each ton of oref.
   g. All the machinery is worked by water, and about 70
Europeans and 700 negroes are employed.
   h. The quantity of water in the mine is inconsiderable; at
about forty-two fathoms deep in the Bahu it issues from the
vein at a temperature of 68°; and somewhat shallower, in the
Eastern Cachoeira, at 69°.
     The richer portions of the vein        at Morro Velho, as in                                 all
other   mines,   are connected              by

stopped.      Having shown this novel experiment to some sci
entific friends, it was suggested that the electricity might be
produced by currents of heated air circulating around the
glasses. To ascertain this, I blew with a bellows on the glasses
without stopping the rotations: these revolutions are explained
by the before-mentioned diagram, and arise from attraction
and repulsion.       To show beyond doubt that the phaenomenon
was   electric,       I
                  removed one of the glasses and brought the arm
of the needle so as to touch the other glass; it was immedi
ately repelled, and both arms stood parallel to a tangent, some
times one arm being somewhat attracted and then repelled.
A heated glass tube attracted either arm. When the doors
were shut the revolutions decreased; this did not arise from
any draught up the chimney, but from pure air being more fa
vourable than stagnant and warm air, in some measure de

after the able experiments and inferences of Dr. Faraday and
 Mr. Armstrong,     I  should attribute the electricity to the fric
 tion of the water against the sides of the boiler, caused by
 rapid currents of steam passing from the bottom, aided by im
 mense pressure and heat.       If it were the steam carrying water,
 surely the greatest electrical force should be at the exit, and
not at the sides; the steam may be a carrier and give shock.
To show the conducting power of steam, at
tach a pith-ball by a silk thread and wax to
an excited glass tube.        On bringing this
near a lighted candle the electricity is dissi
pated.     The celebrated philosopher, M.
Arago, states that this is occasioned by the
conical blaze, whereas it arises from the va
pour of the candle.

make known some perfectly new, and              I hope interesting, ex
periments on the pyro-electricity of the glass cover of the bi
nacle compass produced by the solar rays, giving a new view
of that deflection of the needle which was attributed to local
attraction.     Humanity makes this a subject of great interest,
and therefore I shall give the experiments much attention.
LIX.     Description   of a Simple Method of Magnetizing           Steel
                Bars.    By P. ELIAs of Haarlem.*.
AT magnets
        the present day, when the possession of powerful steel
                  must be desirable to experimentalists, it will
perhaps not be without interest to many to become acquainted
with the method by which the smallest needle as well as the
heaviest steel bar can be instantly magnetized to saturation
with the greatest facility.
    The method hitherto employed is that of the double passing,
discovered by Knight and improved by Duhameland Mitchell.
Several persons have proposed the employment of electro
magnets for this purpose, others suspending the steel bar to be
magnetized at a red heat to the pole of an electro-magnet, and
allowing it to cool in that position. The first method is            in
convenient, as it is not possible to move electro-magnets about
so freely as steel magnets; the latter, as every one knows, is
without effect; consequently the old method has been retained.
This however has the inconvenience, that in the first place it
is necessary to be well acquainted with the manipulation of
magnetizing; and secondly, that you must already possess that

rarely the case.

   With my method require nothing more than what every
experimentalist possesses, and may be had everywhere, a pow
erful voltaic pair and some copper wire.       From twenty-two
to twenty-five   feet of well-isolated  copper  wire are wound
round to form a hollow, very short, but very thick cylinder
(see woodcut).     A strong current is passed through the wire,
and the steel bar to be magnetized is placed in the cylinder,
in which it is moved up and down to the very ends. When
the central portion of the steel bar again occupies the cylinder,
the circuit is opened, and the bar, which is now perfectly mag
netized, withdrawn.         When the bar is curved in the form of
a horse-shoe, it is well to close it with           keeper during the     its
magnetizing, and when straight one,        a      provide        top and
                                                                      to              it   at

 of mine had  a steel horse-shoe made, weighing thirty-four

without  having   lost           its

 Mr. Stagg         on the prevention                 of Explosions in Collieries.                         351
ties an idea that may be of some value, and, possibly, in abler
hands, may be rendered available.
   It appears that though the safety lamp possesses many merits,
and has doubtless been of immense service, yet, under cer
tain circumstances, it fails to offer perfect security; and this
has led me to imagine that the light produced by a current of
galvanic electricity might be applicable.
   This could be done by having the wires from a galvanic
battery conducted into the middle of a strong glass tube, in
the usual way of obtaining a constant electrical light.                  All
access to external air or inflammable gases might be prevented
by carefully and hermetically sealing the parts where the wires
enter, and, on the battery being charged, a sufficient and safe
light would in            all
                        probability                     be

a  method would not               great

LXI.        Investigation of the Transformation of certain Elliptic
       Functions.    By ARTHUR CAYLEY, Esq., B.A., F.C.P.S.,
       Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
       GENTLEMEN,
    should be obliged if you would do me the favour of insert
       ing the following investigation of the transformation of
elliptic functions, which appear to me completely to demon
strate that no limitations are required in Jacobi's conclusions
(see Phil. Mag. S. 3. vol. xxii. p. 358; xxiii. p. 89). I should
not have resumed the subject had not the method employed
seemed to me to possess some independent interest.

vals. On the present occasion       I shall endeavour to point out
a consequence of the latter part of this hypothesis which has
recently suggested itself to me.
    Dr. Young, in his Theory of Reflexion,        takes for granted
that the waves   composing   common    light occur in uninterrupted
succession.     But if we make a careful application of the pro
cess of reasoning which he has adopted to the case in which the
waves are supposed to occur at finite intervals, we shall find
that if a series of such waves be reflected at a plane surface,
the reflected light will not consist of continuous waves, but
the surface of each reflected wave will be intersected by dark
bands, in which there will be no vibration.       These bands will
be   parallel to each other and to the intersection of the inci
dent waves with the reflecting surface, and their breadth will
at first be exactly equal to the interval between two waves of
the incident light. "We say at first, for after reflection the
broken surface of the wave will tend to re-unite so as to form
a continuous surface, though this continuity will never be
perfectly effected, so that the reflected waves will always con
sist of parallel bands of varying intensity.         If the light be
again reflected in a plane perpendicular to the plane of first
reflexion, we shall, in like manner, have the surface of the
waves twice reflected, intersected by two series of bands per
pendicular to each other. Hence it is plain that if the inter
vals between the waves of the incident light bear any consi
derable proportion to the breadth of the waves, very little
light will be transmitted after the second reflexion; and the
light so transmitted will be different in character, both from
common light and from light only once reflected; the waves
being discontinuous in every direction, may not this disconti
nuity be such as to prevent vision? and is it not possible that
the change in the nature of the reflected waves which we have
endeavoured to point out may constitute polarization 2
    If we address ourselves to the case of refraction, we shall
be led to similar results.     But it should be observed that, as
in the case of   refraction, the breadth of the bands will not be
equal to the interval between two waves, but will be equal to
sin i!
       multiplied into that interval.     Hence we see that in the
  in i
case   of refraction the discontinuity of the wave will be sooner
repaired than in the case of reflexion, or the polarization will be
less perfect.    The case of double refraction presents great, if
not insuperable, difficulties, but these we will not altogether
despair of removing.      It will be observed that the polarization
of which we have     spoken  must always take place in a plane per
pendicular to the intersection         the incident waves with the
                                   A.

reflecting or refracting surface.           Hence if a series of parallel
plane waves be transmitted through a doubly refracting cry
stal, there can be none of that polarization in opposite planes
of the incident and emergent rays, of which so much has been
said. Although unable to support myself by any reference to
the results of actual experiment, I would with                  humility beg           all
leave       doubt whether this polarization

   More lately M. Liebig has examined the atomic weight and
constitution of many of the organic alkalies by a new method
proposed by himself”. These bases in most cases form inso
luble double salts with bichloride of platinum, which in their
constitution are exactly analogous to the bichloride of plati
num and ammonium; one equivalent of bichloride of platinum
being united to one equivalent of the hydrochlorate of the
base.    From the quantity of metallic platinum left after com
bustion, the atomic weight can be easily calculated.
   The double salt of platinum and narcotine gave in 100 parts
 14.508 and 14.64 of metallic platinum.           The atomic weights
corresponding to these are 5930 and 5780. The formula cal
culated by M. Liebig from these numbers with the analysis
formerly made, was Cas H2, NOls.
   The following table exhibits the great difference in the
composition of narcotine admitted by M. Liebig, Regnault
and Pelletier, although the results of the analyses are nearly
similar.

  These widely-differing formulae, calculated from analyses
agreeing so nearly, made it particularly necessary to deter
mine anew the atomic weight.                        I
                                 undertook the subject at the
request of Professor Liebig, to whose valuable assistance in
the further prosecution of my investigation  consider myself                I
much indebted.

   The determination of the         platinum    in the double salt of that
metal was the method adopted in my investigations. The first
attempts gave constantly varying results; the per-centage of
platinum found being 15:441, 16-7, 14-303, 14.84, 16' 1, 16-6.
The following per-centages of platinum obtained by my friend
Dr. A. W. Hofmann were kindly communicated to me,
16-63, 1649, 1677.           From these numbers it appeared that
the atomic weight of narcotine could not be deduced accu
rately from      its

 368         Dr. Blyth           on the Composition                  of Narcotine.
     An ounce and a half of narcotine, dissolved in dilute hydro
  chloric acid, was precipitated by bichloride of platinum, and
  formed into a thin paste by the addition of distilled water.
  A large excess of bichloride of platinum, amounting fully to
  the quantity used for precipitation, was then added, and the
  whole heated in a basin over a fire. Upon the mass becoming
  blood-warm, the colour of the fluid portion changed from
  yellow to orange, and traces of opianic acid were formed.
  On further elevation of the temperature, but considerably
  before arriving at the boiling-point, the fluid assumed a still
  darker orange colour, the platinum double salt melted, and a
  quantity of opianic acid made                      its
                                              appearance.      To ensure                        an
 uniform     product     ebullition was continued for half              hour,             an
at    the end     of which time the opianic acid was re-dissolved
 and the surface        ofthe liquid became covered with dark red
 crystals. These were separated                          by
                                               rapid filtration, and washed
 with hot distilled water           free them from all traces of the ac
                                      to
 companying acid. The acid was deposited                         fine needles  in
 from the filtered liquid            cooling. The mother-liquor, de
                                          on
 canted and further evaporated, gave another portion mingled
  with long crystals        ofrhombic prismatic form. These being
                                 a
 more soluble than the        opianic    acid, were redissolved and sepa
 rated  by   filtration.
     The fluid evaporated           one-tenth
                                          to         original quantity be

 came   of   a   very dark brown colour, gave off hydrochloric
 acid abundantly, and deposited large colourless crystals                                      in
 the form    of  rhombohedrons, which upon resolution and rapid
 crystallization assumed their original figure                 long rhombic    of
 prisms.

    Another analysis of this double salt, prepared directly from
the base, will be given afterwards.
    From the platinchloride of cotarnin the base can be easily
separated     by boiling in hydrosulphuret         of ammonia.   The
 method    I pursued was the  following:—The salt was first boiled
 in ammonia, in which it experienced no change, and while hot
acted on by a stream of sulphuretted hydrogen; decomposi
tion rapidly took place. The residue left, on carefully eva
porating the mixture to dryness on the water-bath, was treated
with distilled water, to which hydrochloric acid was added till
the reaction was feebly acid, in order to decompose the soluble
double salt of bisulphuret of platinum and ammonium formed
during the reduction of the platinchloride of cotarnin. On
filtering, a fluid passed through of a dark brown colour, from
which, on the addition of caustic potash, the base was preci
pitated. The supernatant fluid, decanted off and evaporated
till no trace of ammonia was left, gave another portion of base
which had been held in solution by that alkali.           The whole
precipitate was again dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid,
boiled with animal charcoal, and after filtration again precipi
tated by potash.

LXV.      Observations upon the Decomposition of the Double
  Cyanides by an Electric Current. By Mr. JAMEs NAPIER*.
         some time past I have considered that there were phae
FoR   nomena presenting themselves in my daily operations of
depositing metals by a galvanic current of sufficient scientific
interest to warrant their being collected and given in detail to
this Society. In anticipation of doing so, I carefully noted
down what seemed most interesting, in hopes of being pre
pared to give them as a short series of papers next session:
 I say series, because so far as I have observed,                the double                       all
cyanides, even when they have the same constitution,                      not                                   do
comport themselves            the same manner, giving rise
                                          in                           differ                             to
ent results,              all   of
                      which could not           given      the compass be             in                                of
one   paper.     But these       anticipations    have been somewhat

380                 Mr. Napier          on the Decomposition                of the
                                 I
influence to another need hardly say is absurd; and it is well
 known that the conducting medium in any fluid is the sub
stance decomposed.            It is certain that the free cyanide of po
 tassium, which is added with the idea of giving conduction, is
not decomposed.            The question then occurs, what part does
it take in these operations? I have observed that, whilst en
deavouring to deposit from the neutral salt, the positive elec
trode, although brightly polished previous to being put into
the solution, instantly assumed a chalky aspect.                 It appeared
probable that this was owing to the formation of cyanide of
silver, which, being insoluble in the neutral salt, obstructed
the current of electricity by                         its
                                              coating. To prove this,                                I
placed     a  quantity          of
                               crystallized cyanide                     of

                of

                   Double Cyanides by an Electric Current.                                381
    Another question suggested itself in connection with the
decomposition of cyanide of potassium and silver, namely,
does the cyanide of potassium which is in union with the
cyanide of silver take any part in these decompositions?                 To
determine this, the experiment just detailed was repeated,
taking care to reduce the power of the current of electricity
when any indication of gas was perceived at the cathode;
when the experiment was completed, the solution containing
the negative electrode was tested for the quantity of cyanide of
potassium by nitrate of silver; it indicated 67.4 grains, which
is more than an equivalent, independent of loss by decomposi
tion. The reason of the cyanide of potassium being more
than the equivalent, is from that invariable endosmose which
 takes place when a current of electricity is passing which is
in the direction of the negative division. From this experiment
 it appears that the cyanide of potassium which is combined
 with the cyanide of silver undergoes no change by the electric
 current, if it be properly regulated to the condition of the
 solution, so long as cyanide of silver is present: this exhibits
 beautifully the different conducting power of the two salts,
 and so long as there is not more electricity than the best con
 ductor can transmit, it will pass through it in preference to
 any other salt mixed with                   it,
                                      although such other may           also         be
 an excellent conductor.          But when the current           more than      is
 the best conductor will transmit,              passes through the next
                                                           it
 best present, which accordingly suffers decomposition;                                     so
 that   in the case       cyanide

                                        potassium and silver, when the
  current      more than the     cyanide        silver will transmit, the

     It is evident, therefore, that the cyanide of potassium and
 silver in a neutral state is a most excellent conductor of elec
 tricity.    A little cyanide of potassium added does however

investigation, as am much inclined to think that many ex
traordinary facts may be gathered as well as important results
obtained from a more extended prosecution of the subject.                                                I
have already made a great number of experiments, and shall
proceed to detail a few of those which I consider to be the
most interesting.
   Having some considerable time since commenced a series
of experiments on the conducting powers of different metals,
among others I made use of several bars of soft iron, and
found that when a bar of that metal is so circumstanced that
it may be converted into an electro-magnet, at the instant
that the magnetism is imparted a sound is given from                  and                       it,
another sound         again perceptible when the galvanic current
                        is
is broken; the two sounds however are not exactly alike, but
appear     tocorrespond with such           may       produced
                                                             as          be

particles composing the material acted upon.                  order how            In

bar in wet clay and not suffering it to touch the helix, but the
effect was still the same.     I tried bars of silver, copper, zinc,
tin, lead and brass, but no similar effect was produced.
   In three bars of equal sizes, one of soft iron, one of hard
steel, and the third a permanent magnet, no sensible difference
in these effects could be detected.
   These experiments tend to prove that the particles of a bar
of iron, when changing                its
                              electrical state, have     tendency de                a

   The first         of
                these relates    the power which plants possess
                                                  to
of substituting one ingredient for another,     for example, soda            as
for potass, lime for magnesia.
   On this point we have        present some rather conflicting
                                            at
evidence.    Saussure, for example, tells us, that firs from two
different soils contain different earthy constituents, although
                      nearly    possible the same; and Berthier
                                              as as
the sum total was               as
has reported similar results     obtained      himself.       these       by                      In
instances lime seems       have replaced potass, soda and mag

   Now it is highly important to ascertain the range within
which this substitution can go on, because the result may serve
to enlighten us as to the extent to which soda, and conse
quently common salt, are capable of supplying the want of
potass—as to whether a soluble salt of lime will serve in the
place of an alkali—and how far, in short, art has substitutes in
store for the ingredients natural to a plant which may chance
to be deficient.
   Such an inquiry is the more important, because the views
of physiologists on this subject strike one as not altogether
consistent either with each other, or with themselves.        Liebig
for  instance,  in p. 66 et seq. of his Chemistry    in     Applica                                     its
         Agriculture, seems       admit this power      substitution,                       of

favour the contrary assumption.               probable indeed that  It    is
both   principles  are true within certain  limits, and    therefore                                    it
remains for future experimentalists           ascertain what these          to
limits may be.
   The inquiry may for convenience sake             distinguished                     be                               as

from an abundant supply of those materials which afford it
these latter principles in greater abundance than nature her
self could provide them, is to make that distinguished writer
contradict the very positions, which, more perhaps than any
others, arrested the attention of the public in his former
 treatise, and contributed to the unexampled celebrity which it
enjoys.
   Nevertheless, as we are dealing, not with the opinions of an
author, but with a question of fact, it would be interesting to
note the rate of growth in a plant, plentifully supplied with all
the fixed ingredients which it derives from the soil, but ob
taining no supply of carbonic acid or of ammonia from any
other source than from the atmosphere, as compared with that
of another in which the fixed and volatile ingredients were
both furnished in equal abundance.      This inquiry might con

   1st. In ascertaining the relative growth of two plants, the
one manured with burned bones, or superphosphate of lime,
and with silicate of potass; the other also supplied with am
moniacal salts.
   2ndly. In ascertaining the effect upon the crops, of a given
weight of stable dung, from which the liquid part had been
carefully washed away, as compared with that of the same
amount where the latter had been carefully preserved.
   Let us suppose for instance the dung from twenty cows to
be applied to a particular description of land, and that from
twice this number to be separated into      solid and liquid por

the  former, and the  liquid portion over   field also    the same
                                                          a                of
dimensions and quality. The results obtained from            expe               an
riment        so
           conducted    might serve    enlightento     with respect   us
to    the above question.
   Another very important train                 of
                                         inquiries connected with
agriculture relates      the power which plants possess
                                  to                            de                   of
composing chemical compounds—the limits within which this
power     circumscribed—and the conditions under which
          is                                                                          it

exercised.
   We know, for example, that plant can decompose

certainty          as
                  the  decomposition
                        to                 ammonia   of   the same         by
agency—we have reason           believe that certain neutral salts,
                                       to
such     as
         chloride     sodium, nitrate
                             of           soda, &c., obey the same
                                                 of
force—and we may suspect that the fertilizing influence                                   of
other compounds        attributable
                             is         the same power—but we
                                                to
still need some further facts to inform us what are the limits

                connected with the Theory                    of Agriculture.                       387
of this faculty, and how far it           may be dependent upon the
stimulus of light.
   Thus distinct experiments are requisite to determine,
whether plants can decompose sulphate of ammonia, sulphate
of lime, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate of soda, &c., as well as
the chlorides of sodium, of magnesium, and of calcium;
whether nitrates are converted into carbonates under the                                           in
fluence of vegetable processes, &c.
   The power of deriving carbon from certain kinds of vege
table matter, as for example from humus, is attributed to
plants by some, but denied to them by others; for although
the latter thrive more in rich vegetable mould than they would
do in any mere combination of earthy and alkaline ingre
dients, yet it is still disputed whether the mould does not as
sist vegetation, merely in proportion as it itself undergoes de
composition, and evolves in consequence carbonic acid.
   Nor is this inquiry merely a speculative one, since if humus,
as such, is capable of nourishing plants, everything which can
contribute to render it soluble will augment                        nutritive      its
quality; whilst           only acts
                            ifit           virtue   by becoming    ofdecom
posed, then our endeavours ought rather                         to

the acceleration        that decomposition, than towards the pro
                             of
motion     of    its
                 solubility.
   Another point upon which vegetable physiologists are di
vided    is,whether plants are capable under any circumstances
of absorbing nitrogen from the atmosphere; and although my
own opinion inclines strongly           the negative side
                                                   to            this ques         of

how much our practice would                  modified   be    ascertaining    by
that    plant       capable

this express object, it would seem far preferable to carry on
such inquiries within the precincts of an agricultural college,

because many of the appliances needful for the undertaking

the mere inspection of such experiments would excite an                                                 in

   At 11 p.m. I noticed the sky, and also five minutes afterwards, but
nothing uncommon appeared. Few cirri of a very electric nature con
verged towards S., and a colourless lunar halo of about 28° in dia

  At 11h 10" I again looked at the sky, which was cloudless, with
the exception of a portion from S.E. to S.W., extending to the ze
mith, which had cirri dispersed  thinly over it; and on a lower level
were a few cumulostrati   clouds,  all converging towards S.; these
clouds were very  high.  At this hour a most beautiful and rare phae

          ON FULMINATING GOLD.           BY M. FIGUIER.
  The author remarks, that there exist two different theories with
respect to the constitution of fulminating gold; Proust, Berthollet
and some other chemists having considered it as a pure and simple
combination of ammonia and oxide of gold. M. Dumas, on the other
hand, in a work published in 1830, has stated the opinion that this
substance is a compound of one equivalent of azoturet of gold and
two equivalents of ammonia; the azoturet of gold acting as an acid
towards the ammonia.
    M. Figuier is of opinion, that the theory of Proust and Berthollet
is more in harmony with the facts of the case; protoxide of gold
yields, like the auric acid, a detonating compound with ammonia;
and we must then admit, adopting the opinion of M. Dumas, a new
and corresponding azoturet of gold; hitherto, however, no compound
whatever of azote and gold has been obtained.
    Added to this, the fulminating compounds of gold at present known
possess exactly the colour of the oxides which furnished them; the
fulminating gold containing the protoxide, like the oxide itself, has
a violet-blue colour; the fulminating gold, obtained by putting am
monia in contact with teroxide of gold precipitated by nitric acid
from the aurate of potash,                 is,
                                   like the oxide itself,        olive colour;           an
lastly, that which       obtained
                            is                      by
                                        treating chloride      gold with am      of of
monia  is  yellow, like the hydrated teroxide, separated cold           potash                     by
from a   dilute solution             of
                              the chloride      gold,           of         or
                                                         like the same oxide
precipitated       by weak acid from aurate
                        a                           potash. The identity
                                                                     of                                      of
colour   of  the oxides       gold, and their corresponding fulminating
                                     of
compounds, leads           the opinion that the oxide
                             to                                gold enters           of                      in
these compounds without altering                              its
                                              nature, and that they are all
simple saline combinations          ammonia,   of   which the oxides act
                                                                     in                                      as
 acids.
    M. Figuier insists principally         the fact, that the analyses
                                                         on                ful                          of
minating gold, containing auric acid, performed             M. Dumas, agree     by
perfectly with this mode         regarding these compounds.

    Four analyses of the protoxide of gold dried in vacuo, and obtained
 by different processes, were performed; in the first two experi
 ments the protoxide was obtained with nitrate of mercury; the third
 from protoxide obtained by potash from the chloride; the fourth
 from tritoxide and potash. In the last two cases the gold was treated
 before weighing with hydrochloric acid; for the oxide thus obtained
 always retains a little alkaline sesquicarbonate, which is not removed
 by washing.

and then strongly pressed between folds of filtering paper. They are
then to be dissolved and boiled in a solution of hypochlorite of soda
to decolorize them, and the solution is to be decomposed by gradually
adding hydrochloric acid. The opianic acid usually crystallizes in a
colourless state on the cooling of the liquid; after washing it with
cold water, the acid is to be again pressed and purified by repeated
crystallizations.

                  ON SILICIC AeTHERS.                       BY M. EBELMEN.
    The author has procured two definite combinations of aether with
silica, by means of the action of absolute alcohol on chloride of sili
cium; the circumstances under which they are produced are the fol
lowing:—
    Cautiously pour absolute alcohol into chloride of silicium, and a
vivid reaction takes place with a very abundant disengagement of
hydrochloric acid gas, and a considerable reduction of temperature;
when the weight of the alcohol added rather exceeds that of the
chloride of silicium, no further disengagement of gas is perceived, and
the liquor becomes very sensibly warm. If it be submitted to distil
lation, there first passes over a certain quantity of hydrochloric aether,
and then the greater part of the liquid contained in the retort distils
between 320° and 340°F. ; the latter product is to be set aside and
the distillation is to be continued until it terminates at above 570°
F.; there remains a mere trace of silica in the retort.
    The product distilled between 320° and 338° was rectified until
its  boiling point became fixed between 323° and 325°;                   this there       by

to the sum of the effects of the inductor wires when the length of

to the action of the constant inductor wire taken isolatedly, or to such

              To Lieut.-Col. Dansey, Woolwich.
  SIR,--I called upon Dr. Faraday yesterday, to beg him to
take charge of a paper I wished to present to the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, on a mode of
raising very ponderous stones, practised, as imagine, by the                  I
Egyptians in the erection of their pyramids and temples; by
the Druids in constructing Stonehenge; and in the location of
rocking-stones, &c.; which I had re-invented in the month of
May last. On seeing the explanatory diagrams                  have had             I
engraved, he told me he had some recollection that a plan on
a similar principle (viz. by tilting the stone) was proposed by
you, many years ago, for lifting heavy guns, &c.; and he re
                                                                                        .
commended me to write to you about                                  it.
   Of course, under these circumstances, feel constrained                                            to

the stone arrived there it was put on another machine, which
rested on the first step, from which it was raised to the second,

one engine, which, being easily managed, might be removed
as often as they deposited a stone; for              must mention both   I
ways, as related to me. The summit was first completed<U+017F>, and

pieces   of wood,   when the idea occurred to me that they might
have been so raised       by some such system as the following
process:—
    Each block of stone, shaped and prepared for use before it
left the quarry, was conveyed across the Nile (advantage being
taken of the periodical inundations) on rafts, or other appro
priate vessels, to the causeway described by Herodotus; along
which it was dragged on rollers, or on sledges if the stone was
smoothed or polished, by the labour of men (or of cattle), to a
convenient locality adjoining the Pyramid, where it remained
till wanted; thence it was conducted to the first step of the
Pyramid on rollers. To get the rollers underneath wedges
were used, if it lay on the hard rock; otherwise the earth was
removed from beneath one half of the stone, the director or
superintendent having placed himself upon the further end to
prevent it from tilting over too soon.
  Next, the director having walked on the top to the other
end, the stone (overbalanced by the leverage          of his weight)
tilted into the hollow in the ground, when rollers were placed
under the other half of    it.

are exaggerated to make the operation more distinct and evident. The last
diagram is a cross section, the others are longitudinal sections.j
    Should any of the stones have been short, and consequently
have afforded insufficient leverage for one man's weight to tilt
them, he might have carried a load; or planks might have been
made fast at the top so as to project beyond the ends of the
stone for him to walk along; or two or more men might have
been employed in traversing the stone; or various other expe
dients might, obviously, have been adopted to tilt the stone.
The wood probably underwent some preparatory process by
which it was condensed and                             its
                                        elasticity destroyed, perhaps
by being subjected         very heavy pressure when sodden with

   Should any of the stones have been short, and consequently
have afforded insufficient leverage for one man's weight to tilt
them, he might have carried a load; or planks might have been
made fast at the top so as to project beyond the ends of the
stone for him to walk along; or two or more men might have
been employed in traversing the stone; or various other expe
dients might, obviously, have been adopted to tilt the stone.
The wood probably underwent some preparatory process by
which it was condensed and                              its
                                  elasticity destroyed, perhaps
by being subjected      very heavy pressure when sodden with

boiling water.

finished, was left in the exact spot where it had been separated
from the rock.     The depth of the quarry is so small, and the
entrance to it so narrow, that it was impossible for them to
turn the stone in order to remove it by that opening; it is
therefore evident that they must have lifted it out of the hol

shafts previously hewn in the same quarry.         Such instances

Mauffly repeatedly, while on duty, pointed out well-known
routes to the river, not only from Great Slave Lake, but from
 Lakes Aylmer and Clinton Colden.                It does not appear that
Captain Sir John Franklin had made up his mind upon the
subject when the river and                            its

adapted for the winter residence and support of an exploring
party; 2ndly, it does not fall into an inlet, having Melville
Peninsula on the one side and land running far to the north
on the other, but into a gulf to the westward of that inlet, in
which the far northern land lies on the right instead of the
left hand; 3rdly, it has not three portages between it and the
 Great Slave Lake.      It is evident, therefore, that it is in the
name alone that there is any similarity between the river for
which the exploring party sought, and that which they found;
and it is equally evident that in the paper read before the Geo
graphical Society it is the Fish River, and not the Great Fish
 River, which is there described. In confirmation, there ap
pears in the official narrative of the expedition in search of
 Captain Sir John Ross, published in 1836, the engraved
chart of a copper Indian, wherein the position, trending and
separation by three portages of the Fish River from Great
 Slave Lake will be found exactly to correspond with the chart
published in the Royal Geographical Society's Journal. We
have the testimony, moreover, of Dr. Richardson, that the
Fish River is well known to the fur traders, and that they
travel to it from the Athabasca in four days; and we have the
further testimony of the fur trader, Roderic Macleod, who ac
companied the exploring party. Additionally, George Sinclair,
one of the most able men attached to the expedition in search
of Captain Sir John Ross and his party, and more recently to
that of Messrs. Dease and Simpson, while on an excursion
for provision, crossed the tributary to the Great Fish River,
said by the Chipewyan chief, the Comrade de Mandeville,
to take its rise near the head waters of the Fish River. That
tributary was seen by him trending in a direct course for the
Great Fish River through a well-wooded country, and afford
ing everything necessary for a winter establishment.
    Surely after such testimony we can no longer doubt the ex
istence of the Fish River; that it takes its rise in a well
wooded district, and that it flows parallel with the Great Fish
River to the Polar Sea. The facts I have recorded, the ex
treme accuracy of the Indians regarding the Great Fish River,
too well known to need repeating here, the northerly trending
of the eastern boundary of the estuary into which the Great
Fish River falls, the southerly trending of North Somerset,
all  combine  to induce me     put implicit belief
                               to                     the original
                                                       in
paper laid before the Geographical Society, that the Fish
River falls into   anextensive gulf, whose west side     bounded
                                                            its is

    Melville Peninsula; and that finally that gulf will      found   be
     abeidentical with Regent's Inlet.     That the Fish River

empties itself into that gulf is rendered more probable from
the fact, that drift wood is found, according to Esquimaux                                                      in
formation furnished to Captain Sir Edward Parry, at Siatoke,
one of the islands of that gulf; and whence could this wood
come, but from a wooded country? and the Fish River is the
only stream eastward of the Mackenzie that is known to take
its rise within the limits of the woods.
   Now Captain Sir John Franklin “imagines that the Fish
River does not flow to the northward, but to the eastward,
and probably falls into Knapp's Bay, or between the Chester
field and Wager Inlets.”      Surely the gallant officer will no
longer entertain this belief.   Again, he doubts the finding of
fuel on the banks of the river or near the source of          he                                         it,   as

wood.      Everybody except Captain Sir John Franklin,                     far                                 as

 I     know, always understood the contrary; besides, the
known confines          the woods, extending

to  Dr.   Richardson,        634°,   sets the matter entirely
                                         to                            rest,                            at          a
fact  altogether    overlooked            Captain        by
                                                     Sir John Franklin.

 veil of mystery and obscurity which has hitherto perplexed
 and thwarted many who, in common with myself, have assayed
 to follow out the experiments detailed by Biot and others,                             I
 may not be considered anxious to throw discredit on their                             la
 bours; but candidly detailing the result of my own experi
 ments,   I  can only say to them, as well as to others, “Si
quid novisti rectius istis, candidus imperti; si non, his utere
mecum.”
    The point in which the results of my own experiments
disagree with those of other observers, is in regard to the al
leged possession of opposite rotations by certain fluids, which
have the property of deviating the plane of polarization of a
beam of polarized light transmitted through them, some of
those fluids being said to produce a right-handed rotation,
others a left-handed rotation.        On examining a great variety
of  samples   of the   particular   fluids said to possess opposite
rotations, I found that such fluids deviated the plane of pola
rization in only one direction, namely, towards the right
hand.     The only fluids in which I have hitherto been able to
discover a decided left-handed rotation is in the essential oil
of lavender, and in that of cubebs”. The interesting fact, if
true, that solutions of sugar, when obtained from different
sources and in different conditions, possess in some cases a
right-handed and in others a left-handed rotation, has not
been corroborated by my own observations. When such so
lutions did exhibit any decided rotating influence, it was uni
formly right-handed.        It          is,
                                   however, curious that solutions
of  cane-sugar differ from those         grape, potato and diabetic
                                                 of
sugar   in  this respect; that whilst the former possessed
powerful rotating influence, the latter exhibited little                          or   no a
rotating energyt, although their solutions were            some cases in

meant by the deviation or rotation                           of the rays of polarized
light when transmitted through fluids said to possess circular
polarization.
   Assuming the general principles of the undulatory theory
of light, and making use of terms which, if not absolutely cor
rect, are at least convenient,                    I
                                       shall first advert to what is
meant by rectilinear, or, as                      I
                                       would suggest it should be
termed, rectangular polarization.
   When a beam of ordinary light impinges on a polarizing
medium, it may be considered as dividing itself into two por
tions, the waves of which respectively undulate in directions
varying from each other 90°, i.e. a right angle, in other words,
they are said to possess opposite planes of undulation, and to
be rectangularly polarized”. This effect may be produced
by five different modes, viz. refraction, reflexion, absorption,
dispersion, and double refraction.
   A number of pieces of thin glass superimposed on each        f
other, and inclined at a suitable angle to a ray of light inci
dent thereon, polarizes one portion of the light transmitted
through it by refraction, whilst the other portion reflected
from the surface is also polarized, but in an opposite direc
tion.     That the two portions into which the light is thus                                                di
vided are oppositely polarized, or may be supposed to undulate
in opposite directions, is established by the fact, that if trans
mitted towards a similar bundle of glass, the two rays would
comport themselves differently; that                             is,
                                                they would not both
be   reflected          or

they form excellent analysers to apply to the eye-pieces of
microscopes; for experiments on circular polarization they
form very useful polarizers.           The blue, yellow and hair

but cannot be so      readily   obtained perfect.
   Agates polarize by dispersion, but are not suitable for ex
periments on other substances.
   Iceland spar and quartz polarize light by double refraction.
The beam of light transmitted through them is divided into
two portions, O and X, polarized in opposite planes, but pro
ceeding in paths so closely posited, that they may both be the
subject of observation at the same time.           This is not the case
however in what are termed Nicol's prisms, which are pur
posely so constructed as to allow only one portion to be trans
mitted when held in one direction, whilst the other is trans
mitted when the prism is revolved a right angle. The rhombs
of Iceland spar are usually rendered achromatic by cementing
a piece of glass properly adjusted to them. In order to render
quartz available a particular construction is necessary, but
when well-made, double refracting analysers of quartz are
equally useful for these experiments.
   It does not matter by what means our polarized beam is
first obtained, or in what manner the same is analysed, or
whether one mode be used to polarize the light and another
to examine or analyse the same.           In     cases the result will     all

a circularly polarizing medium between the analyser and po
larizer, the plane of polarization will be removed to the right
hand or to the left.   In consequence of such change in the
plane of polarization, X will become lighter and O darker.
When the rotation of the analyser proceeds in the direction of
the numbers in the ordinary mode of graduation, the rotation
is termed right-handed, when in a contrary direction left
handed.
   Supposing the rotation produced be 30° to the right, then
the analyser must be also shifted 30° to the right-hand, in
order to obscure X; proceeding onwards, it will be observed
that X becomes bright at 120°, being a further revolution of
90°; again becomes obscured at 210°, or a revolution of 180°,
and again bright at 240°. On registering, then, the degrees at
which O and X are respectively polarized, that        most ob                               is,

   To add       the difficulty, the deviation

which produces a deviation of 180°, furnishes a very useful
index of their comparative circularly polarizing energy.
    If the depth be constant and two circularly polarizing liquids
be mixed together, or if the fluid or substance be dissolved or
mixed in some other fluid possessing no rotating energy, the
deviation will bear a direct relation to the proportion in which
 the two are combined.          For instance, since, according to my
 own    experiments,    10 inches of a solution of cane-sugar in
 water   containing    half     weight     solid sugar produces
                                           its               of     de                            a

 calculation, although the difference has been but slight, and
 this    isprobably due          some degree

   Again, if the proportions of the combination be constant, but
the depth varied, the degrees of rotation will, as before stated,
bear a direct proportion to the depth; thus, since 10 inches of

   To return, however, to the means by which the direction of
the rotation is to be ascertained. The method already described
might be applied in examining solutions of weak rotating energy
which exhibit little or no colour when examined by polarized
light, provided it is not confounded with the effects of mere
depolarization, the appearances then presented being similar
in some respects to those produced by double refracting sub
stances, as described in the twenty-first chapter of Brewster's
Treatise on Optics.     When substances of greater energy are
examined, they exhibit a gradation of colours corresponding
to those of the solar spectrum, which affords a still more sa
tisfactory mode of determining whether the rotation is right
or left-handed. The direction corresponds to that in which
the analyser must be moved in order to obtain the succession of
colours as follows, viz. red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
violet.         If
            the analyser be moved in only one direction, and
that right-handed, or in the order of the figures in the outer
circle of graduation, then the rotation will be right- or left
handed, according to the succession of the colours in the fol
lowing tables.    The general order of succession when the
analyser is moved in a right-handed direction is first given, viz.
               Left-handed.                                 Right-handed.

428    Dr. Leeson on the Circular Polarization of Light
occurs four times in the course of a complete revolution of
360°, viz. twice in the ordinary, and twice in the extraordinary
ray.    With a tourmaline or a Nicol's prism, the tints will of
course occur only twice in a whole revolution.
   That in a revolution of 180° the tints have passed through
all their phases.
   The tints that have been described correspond to those of
quartz, and are more or less vivid in proportion to the rota
ting energy. In fluids the blue violet generally assumes more
of a neutral tint, and in many instances the crimson is scarcely
to be observed.      Of course, if the fluid be itself possessed of
colour, it will greatly interfere with the purity of the tints.
When using a piece of red glass, as recommended by Biot, to
obtain homogeneous light, the tints disappear, and the ob
scuration of X, which is then more complete, will determine
the amount of rotation.       The red glass sent by Mons. Soleil
with Biot's   apparatus   is much too dark, and occasions so great
a loss of light  as materially  to interfere with the delicacy of our
                                                    .
readings. Of course the direction of the rotation should be
observed without it.
   Daylight is preferable to artificial light for these experi
ments; unless, as before explained, in              case of a coloured
polarizer, attention is paid to the appearance of O when arti
ficial light is employed, the results will not agree with those
obtained by daylight.
    Having explained the appearances which are to guide our
experiments,       Iproceed to a description of the apparatus
which I constructed for the purpose, and which is similar in
some respects to the arrangement of the Rev. B. Powell, de
scribed in the Philosophical Magazine for April 1843.

the depth of the liquid; I would strongly advise any one ex
perimenting on this subject to examine the appearances pre
sented by pieces of unannealed glass, crystals, mica, selenite,
&c., by placing them upon the shelf K K when the apparatus
is adjusted. I should however observe, that some specimens
of unannealed glass, mica and selenite, possess circular pola
rization as in quartz, and it probably exists to a much greater
extent than has been hitherto noticed.
    Water cooled below 39° is a curious example of the phae
nomenon of depolarization last alluded to, which           discovered                   I
about three years since, but did not then feel sufficiently satis
fied with the mode of observation. I have now completely
verified the fact, which may be readily exhibited by means of
the apparatus now described. Since this paper was read                                                     I
have however obtained apparent evidence of rotation, amount
ing to about 15 degrees for a depth of 15 inches, but rapidly
disappearing as the temperature of the water rises.              I am
about repeating these experiments, and shall communicate the
result in a future paper*.

   4. This experiment is so much at variance with the electro
chemical doctrine of Dr. Faraday and the inference to be
drawn from my cinder experiment, that on rewriting my Ele
ments of Electro-Metallurgy, I felt it to be my duty to exa
mine carefully this hypothesis before I adopted or rejected
such an important doctrine. For this purpose his experiments
were repeated and varied in different ways; and with alkalies
on the negative side I readily and immediately obtained the
metal on the diaphragm, but failed when neutral salts were
used on the negative side, or when solutions of gold and pla
tinum were employed on the positive. A series of experiments
 were then instituted on the polarity of solid substances inter
posed between two platinum poles.              I placed a series of cop
 per wires in        all
                     directions and situations between the poles

 each wire became positive and was dissolved, and another part
 of the same wire became negative and reduced the metal from
 the solution;         so
                     that         all

observed this fact, but in the experiments of the decomposi

                                        performed for my work on
 Electro-Metallurgy, did the results show themselves more or
 less evidently; and I may state that no electro-metallurgical
process can be conducted without the production of these phae
 nomena; and one of the greatest, if not the very greatest diffi
 culty which the electro-metallurgist has practically to contend
 with, is the variation in the strength of the metallic salts sub

    11. In what way are the metals reduced if they are not
 transferred from pole to pole? A careful investigation of a
 solution depositing            its

 metallurgist's hopes,        causing grooves        the reduced metal,

 the  negative   surface,  and that  hydrogen     probably    reduces the
 metallic salt.

           jrom their Solutions   by the Galvanic Current.        439
salts of metals into protosalts favours strongly, by analogy, the
same opinion.     Such evidence is amply sufficient, but      I
                                                            have
now to detail some direct experiments in which hydrogen
alone reduces metals from various salts.
   13. The mode in which this satisfactory result is obtained
is very simple. The metallic solution to be examined is placed
in a glass, a test-tube filled with the same solution is then     pro
cured, into which a slip of platinum, platinized as for the con
struction of my battery, is then placed. The whole is then
placed within a glass of metallic solution, and a current of
hydrogen introduced sufficient to extend half-way up the pla
tinized platinum.   It will be seen that the arrangement is
similar to that of one of the tubes of Prof. Grove's elegant gas
battery, and the various results obtained by this mode of exa
mination it will be my duty immediately to explain.
   14. If the solution employed be chloride of platinum the
hydrogen disappears gradually, and the black powder of pla
tinum is coated here and there by a beautiful bright layer of
reguline metal.
   15. With a solution of chloride of gold the same result is
seen, the platinum being gilt with a beautiful deposit of metal.
 With this salt the action is immediate.
   16. With nitrate of palladium the hydrogen is rapidly ab
sorbed and bright palladium deposited.
   17. With nitric acid and platinized platinum the hydrogen
is gradually absorbed and the acid decomposed.
   18. A solution of sulphate of copper under similar exami
nation yields a plentiful crop of small crystals of copper in a
short period.
   19. A solution of persulphate of iron yields rapidly            its
oxygen and becomes converted into the protosulphate.
   20. A   solution  of  nitrate  of silver yields slowly small cry
stals of silver, but the action with this metal  is      so
                                                       not    rapid.
   21. The    hydrogen    was slowly   absorbed when    exposed   to
                                                                   a
solution   of muriate of  tin
                            in   contact with platinized platinum.
   22. Nickel was slowly deposited from the chloride, when
exposed under similar circumstances,       as
                                           a      white deposit.
   23.  Hydrogen,    contrary   tomy    expectations, did not appear
to reduce iodine from iodic acid.
   24. From the solution    of   protosaltsof   iron could not de
                                                 I
termine that the metal was reduced.
   25.
     I    next subjected   to experiment the extraordinary com
pounds     ofcyanogen forming the metallo-cyanides.         From the
aurocyanide     ofpotassiumI    obtained metallic gold.
   26. The argento-cyanide        of potassium, in   a  similar way,

440   Mr.         Smee on the Cause            of the Reduction of Metals
yielded slowly silver, the hydrogen becoming at the same time
lessened.
  27. These last two results are interesting to the chemist,
for it appears to open a path for investigation on the nature of
these very curious and now highly important combinations.
   28. Such were my results with platinized platinum and hy
drogen; the hydrogen becoming absorbed and the metals being
reduced.      It was found that chloride of platinum, chloride of
palladium, persalts of iron, chloride of gold, and nitric acid
yielded the oxygen most rapidly.           It next became my endea
vour to ascertain how far other        metals,  or different conditions
of the same metal, might be used; and smooth platinum was
next the subject of experiment.         With sulphate of copper or
persalts of iron no absorption however took place.
    29. Palladinized platinum was made the subject of experi
ment; and when employed with hydrogen in a manner similar
to platinized platinum in sulphate of copper, it caused that
metal to be reduced.
    30. The effects of silver were then examined, and for that
purpose a piece, carefully cleaned by nitric acid, was immersed
in a solution of copper in contact with the hydrogen, but no
change occurred even after many days.
    31. No better result attended the employment of silver
sponge used for the same purpose.
    32. Nor did the black deposit of silver answer better to
effect the absorption of the hydrogen, and the reduction of the
 metal from a solution of sulphate of copper did not occur.
    33. Copper, both in          bright and spongy states, was next
                                    its
 examined;         in  bright state, cleansed
                        its                                        by
                                                        nitric acid, no
 change occurred.
    34. In   the spongy state         appeared
                                          it                  to greater

                                         the metal.

                                          or     took  place.
    37.       a solution       of
                              sulphate       copper, after many days,
                                                   of
 no   action apparently occurred with paper and hydrogen.

                from their Solutions by the Galvanic Current.                     441
     38.   a solution of nitrate of silver the same negative re
            In
sult with  paper  occurredº.
   39. The persulphate of iron was not changed into the proto
salt by the action of that gas in contact with paper.
   40. As a summary of results obtained on the direct reduc
tion of the metals from their solutions by hydrogen, it may be
stated generally, that platinized and palladinized platinum
alone were found to be competent to promote that change,
negative results being obtained with smooth platinum, smooth
silver, black powder of silver, bright copper, spongy copper,
cinder or paper. These negative results are by no means to
be taken as a proof that under these circumstances hydrogen
might not reduce the metals, for it is possible under certain
conditions that many other substances, like finely-divided pla
tinum, might possibly take on the power of assisting in this
mysterious way the absorption of the gas.
   41. These various direct experiments of the deoxidizing
agency of hydrogen gas are valuable to the electrician, as they
point out the cause of some of the most interesting galvanic
phaenomena. To the electro-metallurgist they assume a much
higher importance, for they point out to him, that in the de
composition of the metallic fluid the uniform strength will not
be preserved by the changes taking place by virtue of the vol
taic current.    He must therefore remember in all cases to
bring into play the attraction of gravity, not only to cause the
diffusion of the newly-formed salt, from which the metal is to
be deposited, but the acid to dissolve the oxide formed at the
positive pole. The mode in which the metals are reduced
may appear quite immaterial to the practical man, but he will
find that the non-uniform diffusion of the metallic salt arising
from the particular manner in which the reduction takes place,
is the cause nearly of                 all
                            his troubles.
   42. From            all
                   these experiments we have        overwhelming

sult with paper occurredº.
   39. The persulphate of iron was not changed into the proto
salt by the action of that gas in contact with paper.
   40. As a summary of results obtained on the direct reduc
tion of the metals from their solutions by hydrogen, it may be
stated generally, that platinized and palladinized platinum
alone were found to be competent to promote that change,
negative results being obtained with smooth platinum, smooth
silver, black powder of silver, bright copper, spongy copper,
cinder or paper. These negative results are by no means to
be taken as a proof that under these circumstances hydrogen
might not reduce the metals, for it is possible under certain
conditions that many other substances, like finely-divided pla
tinum, might possibly take on the power of assisting in this
mysterious way the absorption of the gas.                     -
   41. These various direct experiments of the deoxidizing
agency of hydrogen gas are valuable to the electrician, as they
point out the cause of some of the most interesting galvanic
phaenomena. To the electro-metallurgist they assume a much
higher importance, for they point out to him, that in the de
composition of the metallic fluid the uniform strength will not
be preserved by the changes taking place by virtue of the vol
taic current.    He must therefore remember in all cases to
bring into play the attraction of gravity, not only to cause the
diffusion of the newly-formed salt, from which the metal is to
be deposited, but the acid to dissolve the oxide formed at the
positive pole. The mode in which the metals are reduced
may appear quite immaterial to the practical man, but he will
find that the non-uniform diffusion of the metallic salt arising
from the particular manner in which the reduction takes place,
is the cause nearly of                all
                             his troubles.

finally the direct experiments of the reduction of gold, silver,
platinum, palladium, nickel, copper, tin, and the decomposi
tion of the persalts of iron and nitric acid inclosed within a
 tube, appear to set the question to rest, and to point out in the
 clearest manner that hydrogen is the cause of the reduction of
 the metals.    All the experiments which I have detailed only
 add confirmation to the valuable researches of Faraday on
 Electro-Chemical Decomposition, published in the Philoso
 phical Transactions.      To the inquiring mind a question na
 turally arises as to whether the hydrogen reduces the metal
 directly from the metallic solution, or whether it reduces                                                 its
 oxide. The former opinion, from the above experiments, ap

  plate to the vapour of either iodine or bromine.                Although
  this fact has   long     been   known,    the nature of the action by
  which so   extraordinary      an effect is produced, has not yet been
  satisfactorily explained.         In the hope of elucidating this sub
 ject, a series of experiments was instituted, the results of which
  are recorded in the following remarks.
      In order to prevent misapprehension, as well as to avoid
 circumlocution, it will be well, before proceeding to the ex
 periments, to describe very briefly the various stages of the
 process by which the sensitive surfaces employed, were pre
 pared. A smooth surface of pure silver plated upon copper
 is rendered perfectly clean, and is at the same time highly
 polished by being rubbed or scoured with a mixture of pow
 dered tripoli and dilute nitric acid; the mixture being applied
 to and rubbed about the plate by a pledget of cotton wool.
 When the plate has been sufficiently treated in this way (the
 time required for which can only be determined by experi
 ence), the mixture is removed by pledgets of dry wool. The
 polish of the surface is still further improved by buffing the
 plate with a buff of clean cotton velvet on which fine char
 coal powder has been sprinkled.             The surface of a plate of
 silver thus treated is       highly   polished,  and is assumed to be
 perfectly free from foreign matter.            In order to render such
a plate sensitive to light, it is supported over a vessel contain
ing iodine, the silver surface being of course downwards.
 The vapour of iodine immediately attacks the surface of the
silver, and forms, by combining therewith, a stratum of iodide
of silver. By removing the plate from time to time and ex
amining it by a feeble light, the relative thickness of the film
of iodide of silver may be ascertained by                   colour.by  The
plate    atfirst has       yellow colour, which
                           a                                         its

454.                    Prof. Liebig on the Constitution                         of
composition.       It is a well-known fact, that when all the milk
sugar in a given quantity of milk has become converted into
lactic acid, a fresh quantity of lactic acid may be produced by
repeated addition of milk-sugar; indeed, the common white
caseine in a state of decomposition yields, upon renewed ad
 ditions of milk-sugar, almost unlimited quantities of lactic
 acid, provided the precaution be taken to neutralise the free
 acid from time to time by means of an alkali.               Grape-sugar
 and   cane-sugar,    under the same       conditions,   yield   the same
 products as milk-sugar.         The examinations and experiments
 of Haidlen” have proved that milk in                fresh state containsits
neither lactic acid nor lactates.
    So long       chemists were ignorant
                    as                                               of
                                                   the intimate relation
 existing between lactic acid and the milk-sugar contained                                                   in
 milk, there appeared              some reasons for believing
                                         to   be                        the                             in

tates mentioned as constant constituents; not because they
have in reality been detected in these fluids,-for no one has
as yet succeeded in producing lactic acid therefrom,  but be
cause, upon examining the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of
blood and urine, some non-crystalline matters have been found
which sometimes manifested an acid reaction, and upon inci
neration left a carbonated alkali as a residue, thus presenting
a remote similarity in deportment to the alkaline lactates.

body of carnivorous animals? With the exception of fat, they

stances be mixed with water, so as to form a milky fluid, and
be then added to urine with an acid reaction, the acid reac
tion immediately disappears, and a very considerable white
precipitate is formed.     The fluid now manifests a feebly alka
line reaction, and contains a trace of magnesia in solution. It
is a remarkable circumstance that magnesia withdraws the
phosphoric acid from the urine so completely, that a mixture
of perchloride of iron and acetate of potass no longer indicates
a trace of phosphoric acid in the urine which has thus been
treated with magnesia.
    Had lactic acid been the solvent of the phosphate of lime
and magnesia in the urine, one would have expected that a
corresponding amount of barytes, or of magnesia, would have

          the Urine in Man and Carnivorous Animals,            457
was immaterial whether the presence         of lactic acid was de
tected in fresh or in putrid urine; if    it was found to exist in
the latter, this fact must be considered as a confirmation of
Berzelius's examination of fresh urine; whilst its absence from
putrid urine would justify us positively to assert that it does
not form a constituent of fresh urine; and, moreover, that
urine contains no substance giving origin, by putrefaction, to
the formation of lactic acid.
     I have come to the latter conclusion.   I  found it impossible
to detect the    presence  of lactic acid in putrid   urine; and if
we examine somewhat more        closely and   minutely  the experi
ments made by Berzelius, and from which he inferred the
presence of lactic acid in urine, we find that not one of them
amounts to a positive proof that- lactic acid really forms a con
 stituent of fresh urine.
     The experiments which I made for the purpose of ascer
 taining the presence of lactic acid in putrid urine are the fol
 lowing:—
     Putrid urine was first evaporated over an open fire, and    af
 terwards to dryness in a water-bath; the residue was treated
 with a mixture of alcohol and sulphuric acid, which caused
 the solution of phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and of
 lactic acid also, if this latter substance were really present.
 The fluid obtained was saturated with oxide of lead, and then
 filtered off from the phosphate, sulphate, and chloride of lead
 formed; the lead contained in the filtered solution was sepa
 rated by sulphuretted hydrogen.         The solution thus freed
 from lead, and which ought to have contained the lactic acid,
 had there been any present, was evaporated in a water-bath,
 and the residue treated with alcohol,-a quantity of common
 salt remained. In order to remove the soda from the alco
 holic solution, effloresced oxalic acid was dissolved in the
 latter, at a high temperature, and the oxalate of soda formed
 was separated from the fluid by filtration; the fluid was then
 saturated with oxide of lead, which again gave rise to the
 formation and separation of chloride of lead.         The solution
  was again freed from the lead which had dissolved sulphuretted
  hydrogen, then concentrated in the water-bath, and basic ace
  tate of lead added in excess; a copious white precipitate was
  formed, from which the fluid was filtered off. This fluid
  must contain the lactic acid if any had been present in the
  urine; the lead which this fluid held in solution was precipi
  tated by sulphuretted hydrogen, the fluid filtered off from the
  precipitate, concentrated in the water-bath and boiled with hy
  drate of barytes,—a quantity of ammonia was expelled by this

operation. After the decomposition of the ammoniacal salt the
new-formed salt of barytes was cautiously decomposed by
sulphate of zinc, and every possible means was applied to ob
tain from this fluid crystals of lactate of zinc, but without suc
cess—no trace could be discovered.
   The white precipitate obtained by means of the basic ace
tate of lead contained hydrochloric acid, and a brown resinous
substance, which, upon combustion, behaved like an animal
substance.
    In other experiments             the putrid urine was boiled until                                   all
the carbonate           of    ammonia contained was completely expelled;

as to be able to prepare   with it many ounces of acetate of lead;
from the salt of lead thus formed I was able to produce acetic
aether and concentrated acetic acid, which, by mere agitation
with aether, lost all urinous odour.    Over and above all these
tests, the salt of silver formed by this acid was subjected to
analysis; it had crystallized like the common acetate of silver,
in shining scales, of easy solution in hot water.
   0.4319 grim. of this salt of silver yielded 0-2808 grim. of
metallic silver.
   0.9375 grim. yielded 0-4737 of carbonic acid, and 0-1508
of water.

These proportions correspond exactly with the formula                              of
benzoic acid.
    With respect to the question of the presence of acetic acid
and benzoic acid in fresh urine, no doubt can be entertained
that the latter is not contained, as benzoic acid, in fresh urine,
since it has been proved by the experiments of Ure and Keller,
that crystallized benzoic acid becomes in the organism con
verted into hippuric acid, and appears in the urine as hippu
rate of soda.    Now, as we also know that the hippuric acid
contained in the urine of herbivorous animals passes into de
composition upon the putrefaction of their urine, and that
benzoic acid is one of the products of this decomposition, we
may safely and positively assume that the benzoic acid in pu
trid human urine has the same origin, and that consequently
it must exist in fresh urine in the form of hippuric acid. This
has been fully confirmed by the results of minute examina
tions.     All the urine taken in this country from individuals
living upon a mixed animal and vegetable diet, contains hip
puric acid, besides uric acid, and about the same proportion
of both acids. Hippuric acid may be obtained in the follow
ing manner, even from proportionally small amounts of fresh
urine:—Fresh urine is evaporated in a water-bath to the con
sistence of a syrup; it is then mixed with some hydrochloric
acid, and agitated with          its
                               own volume                  of
                                                  aether, which latter
substance dissolves the hippuric acid.               usually happens
                                                              It
that the mixture does not     separate   spontaneously,    but that the
aether remains inclosed          by
                               the fluid, like froth; the separation
of  the aether takes place immediately upon adding            the mix       to
ture, after having allowed            stand for
                                       it   to       hour, one-twen

                    volume       of

                                                      In
appears, and the fluid separates into two layers; the upper
layer contains the hippuric acid           solution, but      also con
                                                 of in

tains   urea, owing         to
                         the addition     the alcohol. This upper
layer    iscarefully removed            by

and agitated with small portions          water; the water removes
                                                 of
the alcohol and the urea, whilst the hippuric acid remains                         in

    In   itspure state the hippuric acid obtained from human

          the Urine  in Man and Carnivorous Animals.            46 l
urine presents the same long, shining, transparent, four-sided,
obliquely-truncated prisms, by which the hippuric acid pro
cured from the urine of animals is so easily detected and        di
stinguished from benzoic acid. The hippuric acid of human
urine is not volatile at the subliming temperature of benzoic
acid; at a higher temperature it undergoes fusion, forming a
brown-red liquid, and yields upon dry distillation the same
products which common hippuric acid forms under the same
circumstances, viz. a red-coloured oil, smelling like tonka
beans, ammonia, benzoic acid, and a copious residue of car
bon.     It dissolves in nitric acid at a high temperature, and
yields, upon cooling, crystals of benzoic acid, owing to the
decomposition which it undergoes.
    From 0.499 grm. of hippuric acid produced from urine,
 1:07.91 of carbonic acid and 0-2317 of water were obtained.
This gives for 100 parts—-

 This analysis corresponds sufficiently with the calculated re
 sults to remove all doubt as to the nature of this acid; it will
 be perceived that it contains 10 per cent. less carbon than
 benzoic acid.
    As far as our investigations into the composition of the ali
 ments of man will allow us to judge, they contain no benzoic
 acid from which hippuric acid might have been formed, and
 as the urine of cows is invariably rich in hippuric acid, no
 matter whether the cows have been fed upon hay or upon
 beet-roots, of which latter plants we know positively, from
 the results of several examinations, and from experience de
 rived from the manufacture of beet-root sugar, that they con
 tain no benzoic acid, we can come to no other conclusion
 concerning the presence of hippuric acid in the urine of the
 herbivorous animals, and in the urine of persons living upon
 a mixed vegetable and animal diet, than that it is a product
 formed in the organism, to the formation of which the ele
 ments of their non-nitrogenous aliments give birth.
     The presence of acetic acid in putrid urine does not war
 rant us to infer that this acid is also present in fresh urine;
 on the contrary, the experiments made with regard to this
 matter prove that fresh urine contains no acetic acid.       I have
  treated fresh urine  exactly  in the same manner as  putrid  urine,
 and have by distillation with oxalic acid, for instance, obtained
 a fluid of a strongly resinous odour, but not possessing any

462                       Prof. Liebig on the Constitution of
 acid reaction.       When employing sulphuric acid and hydro
 chloric acid the distillate was acid, but the acid reaction pro
 ceeded from hydrochloric acid.
    I  have, in the preceding experiments, several times alluded
 to a nitrogenous resin-like substance, which is present in all
 the fluids obtained in the examination of putrid urine. This
 substance is a product of the putrefaction of the urine, and is
 of an acid nature. If the residue remaining upon the evapo
 ration of putrid urine is treated with alcohol, and the result
 ing solution boiled with addition of hydrate of lime, until am
 monia ceases to be given off, then evaporated to dryness, and
 the residue treated with cold alcohol, there remains a mass of
 a light brown colour, which, at a high temperature, may be
 kneaded like resin, and drawn out into long threads, and
 which, upon combustion, emits a strong smell of urine, and
 leaves a quantity of carbonate of lime as ashes.
    If  putrid urine is evaporated and sulphuric acid added, after
 the  lapse   of some time, an oily, black-coloured substance se
 parates, which, being washed with water, assumes the appear
 ance of pitch. It is soluble in alcohol and in alkalies. Upon
 distilling putrid urine with mineral acids this substance is ob
 tained in the residue to a considerable amount, although                                                   al

acid. The putrefaction of urea seems to be completely pre
vented by the presence of sugar, or milk-sugar; at least, in
several experiments where one or the other of these two sub
stances were present in the putrefying urine, the urea of the
urine had not, even after the lapse of three months, acquired the
property of effervescing with acids. I must here remark that
a considerable amount of ammonia is formed in the process
of putrefaction, owing to the resulting decomposition of an
other nitrogenous organic substance.          This ammonia causes
the protoxide of copper, formed upon testing the urine for
milk-sugar with potass and sulphate of copper, to remain in
solution, and to precipitate only upon the addition of acetic
acid.
     It follows from the preceding experiments and observations,
 that the organic acids in the urine of man are uric acid and
 hippuric acid, and another nitrogenous matter (most probably
 the colouring matter of urine), which latter substance, upon
 the access of air, resolves itself into acetic acid, and a substance
 resembling resin. Gay Lussac has already observed that it
 is only upon the access of air that urine passes into a state of
 putrefaction with absorption of oxygen”.
     The considerations which I shall next adduce will prove
 sufficient to remove all doubt as to the cause of the acid re
 action manifested by the urine of man.
     It must be assumed as an irrefutable fact, that the inorganic
 bases present in urine, such as potass, soda, lime, &c., have
 entered the organism through the medium of the aliments.

 There are no carbonated alkalies among the soluble salts of
 these ashes, but bibasic and tribasic phosphates of the alkalies,
 phosphate of soda or of potass, or both at the same time in
  varying properties.         We might have supposed that the food
  in the stomach when in a state of solution would manifest the
  reaction of those salts which form the constituents of the ashes
  of the aliments partaken of Now, in fact,                     the bibasic and       all
 tribasic phosphated alkalies have                alkaline reaction, and yet

   It   isobvious that common salt undergoes decomposition                                                     in
 the organism, and becomes resolved into hydrochloric acid,

nor any salt formed of an alkaline base and an acid which
might be destroyed in the organism, by the vital process, and
thus cause the alkaline base to be liberated. The blood must
contain the same salts as exist in the aliments.           With the ex
ception of common salt, nothing is added during the digestion
of the aliments. We have seen that this substance undergoes
decomposition in the upper part of the digestive apparatus,
being resolved into free soda and free hydrochloric acid; but
we have also seen that the liberated soda rejoins the hydro
chloric acid during the preparation of the chyme, and previous
to the transformation of the latter into chyle; that                 when              is,

salts entering the organism with the aliments can effect their

exit from the body; viz. they must either be carried off in
the faeces or in the urine. The most simple experiments show
that soluble salts are carried off by the faeces only when the
amount of salt contained in the fluids in the intestines is larger
than that contained in the blood; if the amount of salt in
these fluids is equal or inferior to that of the blood, the soluble
salts are re-absorbed by the absorbing vessels of the intestinal
canal, and enter the circulation, and are then removed from
the body by the urinary organs and channels.                  If the amount
of salt contained in the intestinal canal is larger than that con
tained in the blood, the salts exercise a purgative action.

468               Prof. Liebig on the Constitution of
the fluid within the channels of circulation, i.e. the blood, and
              º:
the fluid without these vessels, i.e. the saline water, not exer
cising any            action upon one another, i.e. not inter
mixing by endosmose or exosmose.
    Water containing a larger amount of salts than the blood,
such as common sea-water, for instance, and even the weaker
kinds of saline mineral waters, exercise again a different action
from that of pump-water mixed with 1:100th of common salt;
not only no emission of urine takes place after the imbibition
 of such saline water, but water exudes from the circulating
 vessels into the intestinal canal, and, together with the saline
 solution, is carried off through the rectum; purgation takes
 place, attended with much thirst, if the saline solution be in
some measure concentrated.
   Considering that a certain amount of salts is absolutely ne
cessary to constitute normal blood, we may deduce from these
observations and experiments (which any one may easily imi
tate and verify upon his own person) that the physical condi
tion of the tissues or of the blood-vessels opposes an obstacle
to any increase or decrease of the amount of salts in the blood;
and thus that the blood cannot become richer or poorer in
salts beyond a certain limit.
   Fluids containing a larger amount of salts than the blood
remain unabsorbed, and leave the organism through the rec
tum; fluids containing a smaller amount of salts than the
blood enter into the circulation, absorb, and remove from the
organism, through the urinary channels,                      all
                                               the soluble salts
and other substances which                    do
                                     not belong                to
                                                     the constitution
of the blood;      that, finally, only those substances remain
                   so                                                               in

                  of

 I   have convinced    myself,   by careful and minute examina
tions, that urine emitted after drinking          copious amount
                                                        a                           of
water  invariably  contains     somewhat a   larger  amount        salts       of
than the water which has been drunk; whilst the amount                              of
phosphates contained        the last emitted portions
                                    in                       the urine   of

             is

moved from the organism precisely because they                  longer    no

                                            the blood.      The phos
phates emitted with the urine were, previously, constituents                        of
substances which have been decomposed             the vital processes,

   Now, among the products of the vital processes, which, to

two organic acids, namely, uric acid and hippuric acid, both
possessing the property of combining with the soda or potash
of the alkaline phosphates, and acquiring in the combination
a higher degree of solubility than they possess, per                                           se,

trary, that the urine of man, according to the most correct
analyses, contains a far larger proportion of sulphates than the
aliments partaken of; nay, even that the amount of the sul
phuric acid received into the system must, in many cases, be
equal or superior to that of the phosphoric acid contained in
the aliments.      According to the analysis of human urine made

  15 grains of hippuric acid, and the mixture is heated, both

 posit a trace of uric acid at a temperature from 37°–38°

 even only several hours after complete refrigeration that a
 sediment is formed, consisting of uric acid containing soda;
 this sediment is of an analogous form to that deposited by
 natural urine after standing at rest for a long time. Upon
 collecting this sediment, in one of my experiments, after the
 lapse of twenty-four hours, I found that it weighed 74 grains,
 so that there remained still in solution 22} grains of the or
 ganic acids.      Dilute mineral acids produce immediately, in
 the fluids filtered off from the sediment, a precipitate of uric
 acid.

472                Prof. Liebig on the Constitution of
substances owe their origin and formation to the circumstance
of the lactic acid sharing the bases with the phosphoric acid.
   “In the course of an investigation into the constitution of
urine, in the year 1807,                I
                            found lactic acid as a constituent of
urine; this acid had not, up to that period, been counted
among the constituents of urine; and several chemists having,
on very slight grounds, asserted it to be acetic acid, I sub
mitted it to the test of a new examination; the results of this
examination led me to conclude that lactic acid could not be
confounded with acetic acid, and that the acid found was
lactic acid, and not acetic acid.
   “The lactic acid contained in the urine is the principal
solvent for the phosphate of lime; this may be easily seen
from the fact, that after having extracted from exsiccated urine
the free lactic acid by means of alcohol, the residue indeed
contains acid phosphates, but upon redissolving it in water it
leaves the greatest portion of the phosphate of lime as an                                in
soluble residue.”
   I   deem      it scarcely necessary to examine the reasons which
induced Berzelius, thirty-seven years ago, to assume the pre
sence of lactic acid (a substance the properties of which were
then totally unknown) in urine and in animal fluids.                 The
then    prevailing  idea that lactic acid must be a      product   of the
decomposition of             all
                          animal fluids, because        formed      milk,
                                                                      it
                                                                      is            in
has now turned out              totally
                                   to   be
                                         unfounded. Milk contains
neither lactic acid nor lactates, the formation            lactic acid     of             in
milk being dependent upon milk-sugar.
  It    was evidently from entertaining these incorrect motions
that Berzelius was led         assume the presence
                                        to                 lactic acid  of                in
certain non-volatile fluids          the urine, which have an acid
                                             of
reaction, and contain organic substances beside phosphoric
acid; there        is       no
                        doubt that the presence           lactic acid  of                 in
 these fluids was highly probable,           lactic acid were truly
                                                       if                                 a

                                               all animal fluids. But
when we consider that the        properties                 of
                                                 lactic acid were then
 so little known that many chemists even disputed the fact                                of
its existence, and asserted                       to
                                        be nothing more than acetic

   In   the nineteenth              volume        of   Poggendorff’s            Annalen der

           the Urine in Man and Carnivorous Animals.           473
 Physik und Chemie, p. 26, Berzelius says, “Leopold Gmelin,
 whose lucid researches occupy so distinguished a place in ani
 mal chemistry, has almost put himself at the head of those
 who positively deem lactic acid to be acetic acid.”
    Proust and other chemists had asserted the organic acid
 contained in urine to be acetic acid, and had thereby induced
 Berzelius to examine more minutely the properties of lactic
 acid, in order to determine its difference from acetic acid.
 Thus, twenty-three years after the supposed detection of lactic
 acid in urine, the very existence of this acid remained still a
 matter of doubt.
    Now, although Berzelius states (p. 422 of his work) that
 the assertion of the presence of acetic acid in urine, on the
part of other chemists, induced him to enter into a compara
tive examination of lactic acid and of acetic acid, this exami
nation was not made, as one would suppose it would have
been, with the organic acid of the urine, asserted by him to
be lactic acid, but, on the contrary, with real lactic acid pro
duced from milk; this investigation proved the existence of
lactic acid in milk, but it did not follow from this that lactic
acid is present in urine, since, as   I just now remarked, milk
had been used for these experiments and not urine.            [No
lactic acid can be produced from broth by the method re
commended by Berzelius.]
    Finally, concerning Berzelius's view, that lactic acid is the
solvent of the phosphate of lime in the urine, and that this
substance becomes insoluble whenever the free lactic acid is
removed by alcohol, we need merely recollect the well-known
property of acid phosphate of lime to be resolved by alcohol
into phosphoric acid, which dissolves in the alcohol, and into
the common insoluble bone-earth, to perceive at once the fal
lacy of this inference.   We know that it is precisely upon this
property that the separation of phosphoric acid from lime de
pends.     Alcohol dissolves phosphoric acid and hippuric acid
out of urine evaporated to dryness, but no lactic acid.
   After the preceding remarks, it will not be difficult to ap
preciate the true value of the evidence upon which the assump
tion of the presence of lactic acid in urine and in animal fluids
depends; if I add that the method followed by Berzelius in
his experiments (decomposition of urea by boiling with milk
of lime, &c.) can no longer be considered perfectly exact and
correct, it will be admitted that, so far as our present expe
rience and observations enable us to judge, no kind of putre
faction, such, for instance, as the formation of lactic acid, can
take place in the organs of the living and healthy animal body.

 friend whose views           I
                             am controverting,        I thus enter into a
 searching and critical investigation respecting lactic acid, both
 historically and analytically, it is for the interest of science,
 and to ascertain the truth upon this highly important subject.
 The notion of the presence of lactic acid in the animal body,
 in the gastric juice, in the milk, in the blood, in the urine, is
 so extensively diffused, and the part which has been assigned
 to this acid in digestion, in the respiratory process, &c., is so
 great and comprehensive, that the proof of                  non-presence its
 and, consequently,           of
                             the impossibility        assigning of      any          to
                                                                                     it
 share whatever          the mysterious processes

ganism, was well deserving              being supported
                                             of                  every ad       by
 missible reason.
    The diffusion         lactic acid,

                                   in
 only upon the delusion existing, from the beginning, with re

“I    have taken the liberty here                   to
                                             substitute the term lactic
 acid for acetic acid, for reasons which will                        be

 preceding remarks.”          Now, the reason for this substitution
 was, that Berzelius,         in  experiment made for this especial
                                    an

  It    follows, from all we have hitherto stated, that the acid

of   man, depends upon the nature              the bases   partaken
                                                          of                               of   in
the aliments, and upon the particular form                 their combina of

                                                                    well             as         as
in  the grains     ofthe cereal and leguminous plants, there exists
no free alkali. The aikali which these substances contain                                       is
invariably combined with phosphoric acid: the acids formed
in  the organism         by
                          the vital process, namely, sulphuric acid,
hippuric acid, and uric acid, share the alkali amongst them,

and this of course must give rise to the liberation of a certain
amount of phosphoric acid, or what comes to the same point,
to the formation of a certain amount of acid phosphates of
soda, lime, and magnesia.           The proportional amount of the
liberated    phosphoric    acid varies with the temperature; at a
higher temperature the phosphate of soda dissolves a larger
amount of uric acid and hippuric acid than at a lower tempe
rature, at from 37°–38° more than at 15°.                  It is owing to
this that    urine,   upon   refrigeration,    sometimes deposits uric
acid, or urate of soda in a crystalline state, which of course
can only take place by the uric acid, at a lower temperature,
restoring to the phosphoric acid the soda or potash which at
a higher temperature it had withdrawn from                   At the com          it.

 shows that the amount            the  phosphoric
                                       of            acid and that      the                      of
 uric acid exactly balance each other with regard                their affi            to
 nity for soda.      Had there been present            larger proportion    a

     the other    hand,  the  presence          preponderating
                                                          of    a   propor
 tion   of phosphoric acid would likewise have caused the pre
 cipitation       uric acid, because the affinity
                  of                                       the former for        of
 soda would then exceed that                       of
                                         the latter.    This explains the
 circumstance that urine            certain states, when, from some
                                            in

 of   uric acid        urine must decrease

  amount     ofthe other acids present          the urine increases, be
                                                            in
 cause those acids share the soda with the uric acid                 and                    ;          of
 course the larger the amount

 these other acids the less comes            the share of the uric acid.
It is  likewise   owing      this that uric acid very frequently pre
                                  to
 cipitates from urine upon the addition                 mineral       other of              or

 strongly acid reaction than normal urine.

lies combined with vegetable acids, it is obvious that the acid
reaction of healthy urine is purely accidental, and that urine
of an alkaline or neutral reaction cannot be considered as a
symptom of a diseased condition of the body. All vegetable
aliments, without exception, tubers, roots and leaves, pota
toes, turnips, greens, &c., contain alkalies in combination with
vegetable acids; potatoes, for instance, contain alkaline citrates;
turnips, alkaline racemates and oxalates, &c.     All these plants
yield, upon incineration, more or less strongly alkaline ashes,
the bases of which were contained in the living plants as salts
of vegetable acids.
   It is obvious that by adding these vegetables to a meat diet,
to bread and to other aliments prepared from flour, the nature
of the urine must become thoroughly altered; for the alkalies
which these vegetables contain in combination with vegetable
acids, enter the urine, in the form of carbonated alkalies, and
neutralize the acids, of whatever kind, which may be present.
When partaken of in a certain proportion they render the
urine neutral; when partaken of in a larger proportion they
impart to it an alkaline reaction.

lysis of urine, when made without respect to the inorganic
salts, acids and bases supplied by the aliments, teaches no
thing whatever, and by no means justifies us in drawing there
from any physiological or pathological inference; secondly,
that from the nature of the ashes of the aliments we are able
to determine, positively, the constituents of the urine emitted;
and thirdly, that only when these latter have been distinctly
ascertained can we expect to derive, from the analysis of the
 urine, any correct information with respect to the inorganic
 matters which have come to be present in it through pro
 cesses of disease; this, at least, is the chemical method of quan
 titative investigation.
     Bearing in mind that the urine contains the soluble consti
 tuents of the ashes of the aliments, whilst the faeces contain
 the insoluble part of these constituents, we may from an accu
 rate knowledge of both, at once determine in which urine so
 luble alkaline phosphates must be present, and in which they
 cannot exist. The ashes of all seeds, and of flesh and blood,
 contain a certain amount of soluble and insoluble phosphates,
whilst the ashes of vegetables contain no free alkaline phos
phate, but only insoluble phosphates.          These vegetable ashes
contain far more lime and magnesia than is required for the
neutralization of the phosphoric acid present.           Hence, upon
incinerating a plant, together with                its
                                            seed, and lixiviating the
ashes, we find        the fluid obtained no alkaline phosphate,

generally absent from the urine                   of
                                          herbivorous animals, and
also why,      certain cases, they may

these animals.            If
                      the nutriment of these animals contains no
soluble phosphates, their urine cannot contain any, whilst                          if
we add    a certain proportion       grain   of  their food, the alka

 cess of the kidneys, in the healthy organism, is of the highest
importance for the curing of diseases.
   I believe that there is now required only a small number
of good and correct observations to establish a fixed rule for
the remedies necessary in various cases.          Future properly
directed  experiments   will prove  whether   sanguification  is ab
solutely dependent upon the presence of alkaline phosphates
or not; we shall be able to determine whether weak solutions
of alkaline phosphates are not the best solvents for uric acid
deposited in the bladder; and likewise what is the influence
which aliments rich in sulphur, such as mustard, for instance,
exercise upon the separation of uric acid in the bladder, in
consequence of the formation of sulphuric acid. At any rate,
we may, by a judiciously selected diet, alter with positive cer
tainty, and at pleasure, the nature of the urine; we may,
without causing any injury to health, keep it alkaline for a
long time by adopting a vegetable diet; and this is certainly
the first condition necessary to ensure the entire prevention of
the formation of uric acid, as is the case with the herbivorous
animals.    By         its
                   combination with                          an
                                           alkaline base, uric acid
must      the organism resolve itself into

    Alumina.—This substance combines, as is well known, readily with
 the alkalies; these salts are called aluminates.    Nature presents us
 with compounds in which alumina is united with lime, magnesia, or
 oxide of lead, as in spinelle ruby, gahnite, and plomb gomme. Thus
 alumina may act the part both of an acid and a base.
    The salts of alumina have been examined by a great number of
 chemists, but hitherto the aluminates have been incompletely studied;
 and the author determined to ascertain the precise capacity of satura
 tion of alurainic acid, by analysing a neutral crystallized aluminate.

   Aluminate of            Potash.—This salt may be prepared either by dis
 solving alumina           precipitated by carbonate of ammonia in potash, or
 by fusing in a            silver crucible anhydrous alumina with excess of
 potash.        If,   in
                   both cases, the solution                          be

*º      from the atmosphere. The analyses which the author has performed
tº      of this chloride leave no doubt as to its nature; it is composed of one
ill     equivalent each of metal and chloride, Cr Cl. It consequently cor
        responds to a degree of oxidation of chromium as yet unknown, CrO.
            This same substance is formed when a current of hydrogen is
        passed over green chloride of chromium heated to low redness; hy
        drochloric acid is evolved, and a white crystalline mass remains;
        when operating at a higher temperature, this mass fuses, and on
       cooling presents a fibrous texture.
           Protochloride of chromium prepared by either of these methods
       has the following properties:—it dissolves immediately in water; if
       the water is aérated, and if air be present during solution, the liquor
       has a green colour, but it is blue when the influence of oxygen is
       prevented.       M. Peligot states that he is acquainted with no sub
       stance which is more rapidly altered than this by the contact of
       oxygen; so that in order to ascertain           properties      by necessary               it   is                  to

When heat is employed the precipitation takes place immediately.
   The ferrocyanides of calcium and magnesium being, as already
stated, very soluble in water, it became important to determine the
nature of the precipitated salts; for this purpose a portion of the
lime precipitate, which had been dried at J58° F., was treated with
nitric acid and boiled in it till no trace of prussian blue remained;
the liquor being evaporated to dryness and the residue analysed in
the usual way, gave as results that the salt of lime was composed of

   MY DEAR GRAves, A very curious train of mathematical
speculation occurred to me yesterday, which I cannot but
hope will prove of interest to you. You know that         have                              I
long wished, and I believe that you have felt the same desire,
to possess a Theory of Triplets, analogous to my published
Theory of Couplets, and also to Mr. Warren's geometrical
                                                                                           -
representation of imaginary quantities.     Now I think that                                            I
discovered 4 yesterday a theory of quaternions, which includes
such a theory of tripletst.
   My train of thoughts was of this kind. Since w/–1 is in
a certain well-known sense, a line perpendicular to the line 1,
it seemed natural that there should be some other imaginary
to express a line perpendicular to both the former; and be
cause the rotation from 1 to this also being doubled conducts
to —l, it also ought to be a square root of negative unity,
though not to be confounded with the former. Calling the
old root, as the Germans often do, i, and the new one j, I in
quired what laws ought to be assumed for multiplying toge
ther a + ib+jc and a + iy-Hjs. It was natural to assume the
product = aw–by–cz + i (a y + ba)+j(ax+ ca) + (bs +cy);                                j
but what are we to do with i<U+017F> 2 Shall it be of the form a +3i
 + yj = . Its square would seem to be = 1, because i*=j*= –1 ;
and this might tempt us to take if = 1, or if = –1 ; but with
neither assumption shall we have the sum of the squares of the
coefficients of 1, i, and           j
                            in the product = to the product of
the  corresponding    sums of squares in the factors. Take the
simplest case of a product, namely, the case where it becomes
a square; we have a*—b°–c4+ 2 i a b-H          c--2        and       2.j a          if
                                                                                    b      c    ...

We   have, then, this first law for the multiplication of two qua
termions together, that the modulus of the product is equal to
the product of the moduli of the factors.
   Division of quaternions is easy. The equations (B.) of
multiplication give
            a'-(a^+b^+ c2+dº)-1 (a a' +b b/4-c c' 4-d d");

  The modulus of the quotient is the quotient of the moduli.
A quaternion divided by itself gives for quotient (1,0,0,0) = 1.
  Addition and subtraction require no notice.

birds of Bourbon.
    It appears then that about the year 1670 the island                 Bourbon was                of
inhabited by two species           Struthious birds, one
                                           of                      which was called      ºf

Solitaire, and the other Oiseau bleu. The Solitaire of Bourbon seems
however to have been distinct from, though probably allied to, the
bird of that name in Rodriguez.           Its plumage is stated to have been
white, with the wings and tail terminated with black, whereas Leguat
describes the Rodriguez bird as grayish and brown.                 The Bourbon
species further differed in having a tail similar to that of an ostrich,
and in the beak being lengthened, “like that of a woodcock, but
stouter,” in which respect it must have resembled the Apteryx of New
Zealand. The phrase “ne volant que bien peu” would seem to im
ply that the bird possessed some powers of flight, though possibly it
may only mean that when hard pressed the bird aided                       progress              its
 by  flapping the wings,                     by

 500                Drs. Will and Fresenius on the
have yet been identified. M. Quoy, however, assured M. de Blain
ville that the bones in the Paris Museum which Cuvier supposed to
belong to the Dodo, were brought, not from Mauritius, but from
Rodriguez; and it is therefore probable, as supposed by M. de Blain
ville, that they may have belonged to the Solitaire of Leguat. There
are, too, certain bones from Rodriguez presented by Mr. Telfair to
this Society (Zool. Proceedings, Part I. p. 31); and in the Ander
sonian Museum at Glasgow there are also some so-called “Dodo's
bones from Mauritius.”     All these materials should be submitted to
careful  examination;  and we may feel confident that if Prof. Owen,
who has so skilfully demonstrated the affinities of the Dinornis from
a few fragments of the skeleton, were to take these materials in hand,
he would soon deduce some valuable results, whether positive or
negative, from the investigation.
   Much light also might probably be thrown on the subject if natu
ralists residing in Mauritius, Bourbon and Rodriguez would endea
vour to obtain further evidence.   The alluvia of streams, the soil on
the floors of caverns, and even the ancient mounds of rubbish near
towns and villages, should be carefully searched, and every fragment
of bone preserved. We may hope that the success which has at
tended such researches in New Zealand will stimulate the naturalists
of Mauritius to similar efforts, and that the Solitaires and Oiseaua,
bleus will ere long, like the Dodo and the Dinornis, take their just
rank in our systems of ornithology.

            the true value and importance of inorganic constitu
SINCEents for the existence of plants has been pointed out and
established by Professor Liebig, it has become an object of
high interest in vegetable physiology and agriculture, to pos
sess an extended series of trustworthy analyses of the ashes
of different plants, and of different parts of plants, conducted
with reference to the points to which the Professor has                   di
rected attention in his work, “Organic Chemistry in            appli

 De Saussure available for the determination of the functions
 fulfilled in plants by inorganic acids and bases.
    Berthierº has also made a considerable number of analyses
 of the ashes of various woods; his only object however was
 to ascertain, if possible, what effects the ashes of the wood used
 as fuel in metallurgy would have upon those processes.
     Berthier found by a comparison of his carefully obtained
  analytical results, that the nature of the ash depended to some
  extent upon the properties of soil; he observed that the com
  position of the ashes of the same kind of wood grown on different
  soils, differed considerably; he showed also that the ashes of
  different kinds of plants grown upon the same soil were dis
  similar, and that plants which are identical or allied in kind,
  when grown upon the same soil, yield ashes, the compositions
  of which are also either allied or identical.       Finally, Wieg
  mann and     Polstorfft, by  ascertaining the quantity   of ashes of
  plants which have vegetated in sand and in artificial mould,
  have clearly shown that the increase of plants, their growth,
  and full development are inseparably connected with the or
  ganic materials contained in the earth, and that plants will not
  perfect their seeds if the earth is deficient in phosphates, &c.
     All recorded observations clearly show that plants take up
 indiscriminately the soluble mineral constituents presented to
 them by the soil; and the results of ash-analyses as distinctly
 prove, that for the purpose of assimilation by their different
 parts and organs, they make a selection from those constitu
 ents; that the organism of vegetables, like that of animals,
 takes up and retains those substances which it requires.
    It follows from what has been said, that in the analysis of
 ashes, a number of substances will be found which have not
 entered into the composition of any organ of the plant, sub
 stances which have been dissolved by the juices of the plant;
 and, since we have no means of safely separating them for the
 purposes of analysis, they will remain after the ignition mixed
 with the assimilable and assimilated mineral constituents of
                                                    -

    Nature has provided in the seeds of plants, as in the eggs
and milk of animals,           all
                               the substances which are necessary

 and among arboreous plants, the Coniferae, consist almost en
 tirely of the alkaline and earthy phosphates. They do not
 effervesce with acids, they contain however variable quantities
 of silica and sulphates, but chlorides are either entirely want
 ing, or merely traces of them exist. The ashes of the seeds
 of the oak, of the chestnut and of the beech, and probably of
 many other trees, effervesce strongly with acids; besides
               they contain a considerable quantity of carbonates,
 which have resulted from the salts of vegetable acids con
 tained in the seeds. The proportion of chlorides, sulphates and
 silica to the other constituents, is also in these ashes but small.
     We conclude from these facts, that the salts of phosphoric
 acid are indispensable mineral constituents of the Cerealia,
 &c., and that the oak and the chestnut, &c. require, besides
 these, alkalies not united with mineral acids.
     It would be very difficult at present accurately to distinguish
 the so-called essential and non-essential constituents of ashes.
 A plant requires for                   its

 rides and the sulphates, which are always present               vegetable             in

It   would seem highly probable that the bases              salts     vege        of          of

                                  a

            necessary   for saline plants, may probably            replaced              be

 be unessential, from the fact that their quantities from the same

paper. This is easily effected if the matters be perfectly dry,
the paper in most cases only retaining so much as to be
slightly coloured by the charcoal. The powder is now boiled
for half an hour with pure potash ley (free from silica), by
which the whole of the silica will be gradually dissolved, lea
ving the sand and the charcoal unacted upon. The insoluble
matter is again collected on the same filter, washed, and dried
at 100°C. until it no longer loses weight. The increase upon the
weight of the dried filter is estimated as charcoal and sand.
   The filtered solution, after the addition of hydrochloric
acid in excess, evaporation to dryness, and treatment in the
usual way, gives the quantity of silica.
   The acid solution, originally filtered from the silica, sand
and charcoal, after being well mixed, is divided into three, or
more conveniently into four equal portions, one being reserved
in case of misfortune with either of the other quantities. The
division is best accomplished by means of an accurately gra
duated tube: the whole of the fluid is collected into the tube,
the entire measure then representing the weight of ash experi
mented upon. The solution is now divided into three or four
equal or known portions, the volume of each is noted, and
they are distinguished by the letters a, b, c and d.

alkaline earths are estimated.

magnesia as previously ascertained. The quantity of potash
is determined by means of chloride of platinum in the usual
way; and that of the soda is calculated from that of the chloride
of sodium, indicated by deducting the weight of the chloride
of potassium from that of the mixed alkaline chlorides.
   4. Estimation of the Sulphuric and Phosphoric Acids.--From
the acidulous solution (c), the sulphuric acid is first separated
by means of chloride of barium. The filtered liquid is nearly
neutralized with ammonia, acetate of ammonia is added, and
then a solution of perchloride of iron, until the liquid begins
to turn red, owing to the formation of acetate of iron.                 Care
must here be taken that sufficient acetate of ammonia be added
to convert the whole of the chlorine of the perchloride into sal
ammoniac. The solution is now boiled until it is colourless, all
the iron being then precipitated.           The precipitate, after being
washed with hot water, consists of phosphates of iron and a
quantity of basic acetate of iron.              It is dried, ignited in a
platinum crucible, treated with a few drops of nitric acid, re
ignited and weighed. It is next digested with concentrated
hydrochloric acid, which speedily dissolves                   The solution   it.

however, a larger portion of ash must be employed.
   6. Estimation of the Carbonic Acid.—The quantity of car
bonic acid is represented by the loss sustained on treatment
of a known weight of ash with an acid; and we have else
where described the most convenient method and apparatus
for the experiment.
               B. Analysis of Ashes abounding in Silica.
  Ashes of this kind, as we have already observed, are generally
only partially soluble in acids; their alkalies must therefore be
determined in a separate portion of ash. The chlorine and
carbonic acid are determined in the same manner as when the
ash is entirely soluble in acids.      The quantity of chlorine
found in ashes of this class is however probably always some
what less than it should be, since the alkaline chlorides, when
ignited with silica and carbon, undergo a partial decomposition.
   1. Estimation of the Silica, &c.—Pure potash or soda ley is
poured upon about 4 grammes of the ash and evaporated to
dryness in a platinum or silver dish. The silicic acid com
pounds are by this treatment dissolved, leaving the sand un
affected. The heat should not be so great as to fuse the mass,
or some of the charcoal will be oxidated at the expense of the
water of the hydrated alkali.        Dilute hydrochloric acid is
poured upon the mass, the whole evaporated, and the silica,
charcoal, &c. determined in the manner already described. The
acidulous solution filtered from the insoluble matter is divided
into two parts; one is employed for the determination of the
sulphuric and phosphoric acids, and the other for that of the
peroxide of iron and the alkaline earths, by the methods de
tailed above.
   2. Estimation of the Alkalies.—A second portion of ash (sa
3  grammes)   is ignited in a crucible of platinum or silver wit
four times       its
                 weight        of
                            hydrated barytes, the acid solution
which remains after separating the silica, &c.       precipitated is

we should have expected that                 equal weights    in      the various                    of
 ashes (the abnormal matters            being    deducted),       the   quantities
of   oxygen united         these bases would have been more nearly

516                      Drs. Will and Fresenius on the
hand, bibasic phosphates (PO3 + 2MO).          This relation is
maintained also when the seeds are grown in different locali
ties.   The solution of ashes containing tribasic phosphates
gives a yellow precipitate with nitrate # silver, even if made
immediately after ignition, whilst that of those containing                                                       bi
basic phosphates gives a pure white precipitate.     The quan
tities of oxygen contained in the bases of these seeds (deduct
ing the sulphates and chlorides) are so nearly alike, that it is
evident that the law of replacement of bases applies also to
the phosphates. The following analyses demonstrate this fact.

solubility of the Leguminosae in water, whilst the vegetable
fibrin of the Cereals is insoluble therein.       There is therefore
ground for supposing that the phosphates are also bibasic in
the Leguminosae as well as in the Cereals; the third atom of
the base would be consequently combined with the vegetable
casein, and the tribasic phosphate be formed during the                                                in
 Cineration.
    The great quantity of sulphuric acid (from 3.5 to 4.9 per
cent.) contained in the ashes of peas is remarkable in com
parison to that of other seeds: in the ashes of beans it amounts
to 2 per cent., in the ashes of wheat and rye to only 0.5 per
cent., and is frequently altogether wanting.           It is probable
that the cause arises from the small        quantity   of phosphoric
acid present, whilst the sulphur of the nitrogenous ingredients
is more easily retained as sulphuric acid by the alkaline bases
 during the incineration.      If fresh-prepared ashes from seed
 containing tribasic phosphates are exposed to the air, they
 take up carbonic acid. This is the reason why Boussingault.*
 found in the ashes of horse-beans one per cent, and in that
 of the common beans 3.3 per cent. of carbonic acid.

The leaden tube did not appear to be acted upon, neither could
any trace of lead be detected in the product, which gradually
deposits in crystalline scales, very similar in appearance to
those of iodide of lead.   Fluoride of bromine was prepared
in a similar manner,   but did not yield a crystalline deposit,
being very soluble in water. The latter answers extremely
well for the Daguerreotype, giving instantaneous pictures, but
I cannot at present decide that it is superior to bromine alone.
    Ihope when the Society reassembles to furnish them with
a more detailed account of these compounds.

        INyour
            a paper which you did me the honour to print in
                Magazine for November, I attempted to show
that the general facts of the dispersion and absorption of
light may be accounted for by supposing that the vibrations
of the aethereal fluid are resisted by the particles of matter, the
forces of resistance brought into play being of the same nature
as those which act upon a particle moving in an ordinary re
sisting medium. I made no hypothesis whatever respecting
the law of the resistance experienced by the aethereal fluid, as
suming nothing more than simply the existence of that resist
ance; and             I
               showed that, in the important and really general
case of  circularly   polarized light (for     kinds             all
                                                         polarized            of

rays), the equations        motion mayof    completely integrated

522                    The Rev. Professor O’Brien on the
 N and        T representing
                         the forces of resistance upon, and v the
velocity of any element of the aethereal fluid.
     Ialso showed that, supposing n and k to be positive, h is
essentially positive, which is a result of considerable import
ance.
     I now proceed to examine what consequences result from
certain  suppositions that may be made respecting the nature
and law of the resistance exerted by the particles of matter on
the vibrations of the aethereal fluid.
    18. The first supposition we shall make is this; that the
resistances do not interfere with the principle of the superpo
sition of small motions, but that this principle holds good for
the aethereal vibrations in                        all
                                  cases, whether they take place
in  vacuum           or   in
                   the interior      transparent substances.
                                                         of                                              In
this supposition we are fully warranted          experiment, and          by
we may proceed upon        with confidence.
                                      in it
   We have already,        article 16, stated two consequences
which result from the     supposition    here stated; the first                                      it
them      obvious;
          is       the second we now proceed          prove;                        to               is of
this, that
                       – (C, - C,              nº   +     C,  - nº   ......)
              :        =   n    (C.   —       C,   n°
                                                   +          Cºn*   –    ......),
where C1, C2, Cº, &c. are certain constants depending simply
upon the constitution                 of
                            the aether and      the transparent sub  of
stance    which
             in      is.   it
   19. Assuming the principle           the superposition of   small                           of
motions      hold, we may resolve the vibratory motion into
                to
two components, one parallel        the axis        and represented
                                                     to               of   r,
by    the other
     É,           parallel    the axis  to    and  represented
                                                                of
                                                                y,                                  by   m.
We may determine the laws            propagation    of each compo               of
nent vibratory motion separately and independently               the                            of
other; and then,               by
                        superposing the two components, the na
ture and laws      which we have thus determined, we arrive
                          of                                                                          at
the true result.
   Proceeding       this manner,
                          in                              let   us
                                            first suppose that the
whole  vibratory   motion takes  place   parallel     the axis                 to                of   r:
then willn       zero, and the resistance will act parallel

   24. To explain the rotation produced by certain fluids in
the plane of polarization of a ray transmitted through them, it
is necessary to show that the velocity of propagation of circu
larly polarized light in the fluid is different for right-handed
and left-handed rotation.        How the fluid can have this effect
on   light,  no matter in what direction it is transmitted through
as it,
     is
     a    very great difficulty, and has not been explained        far                                          so

if the   rotation be from right to left, it is clear, from the pecu
liar  shape   of the particle A, that there will be a greater resist
 ance offered to the motion of the aethereal fluid by the upper
 portion (p) of the particle A than by the lower portion (q).
Consequently there will be a greater accumulation of resisted
aether on the side p than on the side q.                On the contrary, it
is clear   that,  if the rotation be from left to right, the reverse
will be the case, and then there will be a greater accumulation
on the side q than on the side p. Now there are two resist
ances acting upon each element of the aethereal fluid, as we
have already shown, one tangential opposing the motion of the
element along                  its
                        circular path, the other normal, opposing the

   Consequently, by what has been just proved respecting N
and T, k will be different for right-handed and left-handed
circularly polarized light, but h will not be different, at least
will differ very little. In other words, the two kinds of light
will be propagated with different velocities, but will not be un
equally absorbed; which is a general explanation of the pecu
liar effect of certain fluids upon circularly polarized light, and
by consequence, upon plane polarized light.
     We    have assumed here that                             is small compared with n,
                                                         v.
but it will do just as well to suppose that the absorbing power
of the medium is very small, in which case h may be regarded
                                                                                  iii.

as zero. All that is necessary         that the two   is,      light
 be not unequally   absorbed                    by
                                   the substance, and   yet    pro
pagated with different velocities.
   We have thus shown that there             certain hypothesis on
                                                              is

which the peculiar effects      certain fluids upon polarized light
                                           of
may   be generally accounted for. We           not however venture do
to put this forward       the true hypothesis,
                                as                       quite con           as

ceivable that some other cause besides that we have supposed
might make       different for the two kinds     light, and either      of
                    or N

   November 6, 1844.—First Meeting of the Session. The Presi
dent, Mr. Warburton, in the Chair.         A paper was read entitled
“Observations on the Geology of some parts of Tuscany,” by Mr.
W. J. Hamilton, M.P., Sec. G.S.
   One of the principal features of the district examined by the
author, is the existence of three distinct mountain ridges, extending
from N.W. to S.E. by S. parallel to the direction of the main chain
of the Apennines, and all belonging to the cretaceous system. The
valleys between these ranges are filled with tertiary deposits. Second
ary formations form the greater part of the mountainous district of
Tuscany, consisting of beds of sandstone, indurated marls and shales,
and compact gray lithographic limestone or scaglia. These some
times alternate with each other, and are variously developed in dif
ferent localities.  Fossils are rare in all of them. The tertiary for
mations are both marine and freshwater. The marine tertiaries at
tain a height of nearly 1800 feet in the basin of Volterra, where
they consist of beds of blue marl and.sandy limestones, capped by
shelly limestone. Marine shells are frequent in some of these beds,
of which the blue marl is the most extensive, attaining in the locality
referred to a thickness of nearly 1000 feet. Selenite abounds in part
of it; also beds of rock-salt and alabaster, extensively worked, the
mines of the latter by means of regularly constructed mining galle
ries. The other marine tertiary districts are those of Leghorn, Pog
gebonzi, Sienna, and Val de Chiana.         Freshwater tertiaries were
noticed in two localities, forming limestones as compact and having
the aspect of scaglia, but well characterized by their peculiar organic
remains.    Extensive post-tertiary formations of calctuff occur in the
valley of the Staggia and of Elsa, and the beds are in places more
than 100 feet thick.     The rock called “Gabbro Rosso" by Savi,
Mr. Hamilton considers as a metamorphic rock derived from the
altered marls and sandstones of the secondary formation, acted on
by the protrusion of igneous rocks of the serpentine class. At the
junction of the Serpentine and Gabbro at Monte Catini is found
copper ore (a sulphuret) extensively worked.       Besides the serpen
tine, the quasi-trachytic rock called Selagite, and the basalts of Radi
cofani, are among the igneous rocks of the district. The author con
cludes with an account of the remarkable boracic acid works at
 Monte Cerboli, and of the phaenomena connected with them.

    ROFESSOR Belli      has communicated to me the results of the ex
     periments made during the late Scientific Meeting at Milan, at
my suggestion, on the conductibility of the electric fluid by the earth.
The two stations were Milan and Monza. In the first experiment,
the circuit, which was altogether metallic, was nearly 12,500 metres.
In the second, the circuit was partly metallic and partly the earth,
that is to say, 12,500 metres of wire and 12,500 metres of earth. In
the third, the circuit was altogether metallic, of 25,000 metres.
   The pile was a single pair of constant force. The intensities were
in the relations of 30 : 27 : 17.
   The result was a confirmation of what I had found with less distances.
   The first circuit, wholly metallic, which gives 30, is the half of
the second in length. This second is composed of the same wire and
of the earth, and in this case we find 27. The difference, very small
in comparison of the double length of the circuit, would certainly
have been found with- less distances of earth, for it is due to the change
of conductor.
   In the third experiment, when the circuit was wholly metallic and
of the same length as the second, the difference became very great.
   When earth is employed for great distances, not only does the re
sistance due to the length disappear, but that even of the wire em
ployed is no longer found.       I still doubt whether this result be due
to chemical actions on the plates.         It would be very important for
science and for telegraphy that experiments on a greater scale should
be made.—Comptes Rendus, October 1844.

ammonia, acetic acid and water.                     He found the composition           as
follows:—

He, moreover, found that they were converted into dextrine by sul
phuric acid; into xyloidine, without the production of any colour, by
 nitric acid; thus they consisted of pure cellulose, containing traces
merely of silica.
    Baumhauer concludes from his experiments, that the perisperm of
the above nuts is not, as Payen supposes, pure cellulose mixed with
albumen, two nitrogenous bodies, two fatty matters, silica and salts,
but that another substance is still present, which has a somewhat
 different composition to that of cellulose. He proceeded in his ex
periments in a similar manner to that of Payen. The seed-coats
 were separated from the brown rind by a file, then powdered by
using a finer file and sifting, and exhausted by aether, alcohol and
boiling water.      The remaining powder, which contained neither
 nitrogen nor ash, yielded in three analyses—
                                            I.                 II.                III.

 It was now repeatedly boiled with strong acetic acid, washed with
 hot water, and alcohol, dried at a temperature of 284°–302°, and
 again analysed.     It gave—

    The powder obtained in the first experiment yielded to ammo
 nia a brown matter, precipitable by acetate of lead; the residue,
 after repeatedly washing with water, acetic acid and alcohol, was
 of a yellow colour. It was dried at 284°–302°, and burnt with
 oxide of copper (I.). Two other portions were treated for a consi
 derable length of time with dilute solution of soda, and after washing,
 &c., also analysed (II. III.); they yielded—
                                            I.                  II-               III.

 After partial evaporation, acetic acid threw down brown flocks from
 the soda solution. Ammonia and acetate of lead caused a whitish
 yellow precipitate in the solution.
    To separate the two substances, Baumhauer digested the powder of
 the seed-shells for several days in cold concentrated solution of pot
 ash; after dilution with water, the powder was separated by filtra
 tion, washed with hot water, and the whole operation repeated as
 long as the potash dissolved anything. The residue was finally ex
 hausted with hot concentrated acetic acid, alcohol and aether.
    The ingredient in solution was separated by saturating the alco

holic solution with acetic acid, washing with cold water, and treating
with hot acetic acid, alcohol and aether.     By digestion with cold
concentrated solution of potash, no decomposition takes place, inas
much as the residuary powder and the dissolved ingredient are both
obtained of a snow-white colour. The powder which remains after
treating the seed-coats of Phytelephas, when dried at 302°, Baum

   The substance soluble in potash, which the author intends exa
mining more accurately, yields the same composition as starch, from
which however, as from inuline, it differs in properties. By decom
posing the salt of lead with sulphuretted hydrogen, evaporation, and
washing the residue with the solvents mentioned above, it is obtained
in a state of purity.—Ann, der Chem. und Pharm. xlviii. p. 356.

bichromate of potash it undergoes no change, nor with free chromic
acid, i.e. sulphuric acid and chromate of potash, in which solution
it floats unaltered even after boiling for several hours. The acetic
solution has a strong bitter taste; however, it does not appear to
produce any considerable physiological effects. 60 milligrammes, dis
solved in acetic acid and taken early in the morning before breaking
fast, produced no effect; nothing could be detected in the secretions.
25 millegrammes were given to a dog and 10 millegrammes to a bird,
but likewise without any effect.

rous acid, hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen in
statu nascenti, and the electric current, afforded however by their
negative results the proof that this substance does not belong to the
phloridzine series, especially as the characteristic decomposition of
salicine by chromic acid was wanting. The combining weight
could not be ascertained, since it was impossible to obtain combina

                 NEW METHOD OF SILVERING GLASS.
   At a meeting of the Chemical Society Mr. Warington described
a new method of covering glass, by precipitation, with a coating of
metallic silver, the invention of Mr. Drayton.             It consists in par
tially precipitating, and thus neutralizing, to use the inventor's own
words, a solution of nitrate of silver by spirit of hartshorn, and add
                                                                           oil

SHOULD the substance presented for analysis be in
the solid state, it must be reduced to a fine powder in
a mortar and then treated with distilled water.       The
aqueous solution having been concentrated by evapo
ration is to be acidified with muriatic, and treated as at
page 5. The insoluble remainder is to be dissolved in
muriatic, nitric or nitro-muriatic acids, and the solution
having been filtered is to be treated as the aqueous solu
tion had been. The insoluble substances generally are
chromic acid, vanadic acid, selenic acid, permanganic
acid, manganic acid, oxide of cerium, oxide of manga
mese and peroxide of manganese, peroxide of cobalt,
peroxide of nickel, red and brown peroxide of lead, and
other peroxides which seldom occur.        The substances
which remain insoluble in water and acids are to be
fused; some with carbonate of potash or soda, and
some with sulphate of potash, after which, being solu
ble in muriatic acid, they are treated as before.
   Should the substance to be examined be a mineral
or spa water, it will be found generally to contain pot
ash, soda, ammonia, lithia, strontia, lime, magnesia,
alumina, protoxide of manganese, protoxide of iron,
oxide of zinc, oxide of copper. Acids,-sulphuric, sul
phurous, nitric, carbonic, boracic, phosphoric, silica,
besides chlorine, fluorine, bromine, iodine and sulphur
united to a metal of the foregoing, together with some
gases in solution, which are to be removed from the
solution by boiling, and tested as at page 36.

    If there be alkaline bicarbonates in solution without
 free carbonic acid, litmus paper is not reddened; but if
 it be reddened and be unaffected after boiling, free car
 bonic acid has been present.
    A few drops of the mineral water is to    be added to
 lime-water in a test-glass; a precipitate redissolving in
 an excess of the mineral water is a proof of free carbo
 nic acid, and consequently it must contain alkaline   bi
 carbonates, or the bicarbonates of lime and magnesia.
 If there be present the earthy bicarbonates (lime and
 magnesia), but no alkaline bicarbonates, or free carbo
 nic acid, the precipitate does not redissolve in the mi
 neral water.
    If  the mineral water has been taken from the vici
 nity of a town, a portion is to be evaporated, dissolved
in water, and tested for mitrates by sulphate of prot
oxide of iron and concentrated sulphuric acid, which
cause the solution to become dark brown; the colour
disappears however after some time; but if a precipi
tate appears during the evaporation, there are no      ni
trates present.
    To determine the presence of iodine and bromine, a
portion of the solution must be evaporated nearly to
dryness, and then treated with sp. wine. The spirituous
solution having been evaporated cautiously to dryness
is to be treated with a small quantity of water, and
the aqueous solution tested for iodine or bromine.
    If  organic matter be present in the solution the
water becomes yellow at the close of the evaporation,
and the salt deposited becomes blackish on heating.

               Note.—In the following pages the course of the ana
           lysis occupies the pages on the right-hand side, while the
           actions of the different substances towards reagents are
           contained in the left.
Brown.     Platinum.—In the concentrated solution, a concentrated
               solution of chloride of potassium or muriate of ammo
               nia gives a yellow.    In the solution acidified with mu
               riatic, potash-ammonia    and their carbonates produce a
              yellow.
Brown.     Iridium.—The      above reagents give a black, but when both
              iridium and platinum are present, a reddish precipitate.
Brown. Molybdenum.—Sulphuret             by blowpipe.     Potash and am
               monia produce a dark brown voluminous precipitate,
               insoluble in excess of the precipitant; carb. potash pro
               duces a yellow-brown, soluble in excess.
Black- Tellurium.—Often milky on dilution. Chloride of barium
   ish.        produces in the neutral solution a voluminous white
               precipitate, soluble in nitric and muriatic; potash-am
              monia and their carbonates produce in tellurous acid a
              white precipitate, soluble in excess.
Yellow. Selenium.—Selenic acid produces a precipitate with a salt
              of barytes similar to sulphuric acid, from which it is
              distinguished by evolving chlorine when heated with
              muriatic.    Selenious acid known by the red precipitate
              of selenium when it is heated with sulphurous acid.
              Heated with soda on charcoal in the inner flame or
              with salt of phosphorus, it is known by the smell of
              radish.
Yellow. Arsenic.—When heated with soda in the inner flame gives
              the odour of garlic; mixed with charcoal and boracic
              acid, and heated in a glass tube closed at one end, a
              metallic mirror of arsenic is deposited in the cold part
              of the tube. Arsenites distinguished from arseniates by
              nitrate of silver, producing in the one a brown, in the
              other a yellow precipitate; this latter distinguished from
              the precipitate produced in solutions of the phosphates
              by being easily soluble in weak acids.

    Colour of
     the Sul
    phurets.
     Yellow. Cadmium.—The sulphuret gives with soda on charcoal in
                the inner flame a brown-red. Potash, carb. potash and
                carb. ammonia produce in cadmium solutions white
                precipitates, insoluble in an excess of their precipitants.
                Ammonia produces in neutral solutions a white preci
                pitate, soluble in excess of the precipitant.
     Black. Lead.—A white precipitate with sulphuric acid, becoming
                black when moistened with hydro-sulph.-ammonia, yel
                low with iodide of potassium, soluble in great excess.
    Black.   Bismuth.-A portion having been evaporated in a plati
                num crucible to destroy part of the nitric acid a few drops
                of muriatic acid are added, and then water in excess gives
                a milkiness. The globules of reduced metal are brittle.
    Black. Copper.—Blue colour with ammonia. Potash produces
                in solutions of deutoxide of copper a voluminous blue
               precipitate, which turns black when boiled with an ex
               cess of potash. Prussiate of potash produces a reddish
               brown precipitate, insoluble in muriatic.      A blade of a
               knife precipitates copper.
    Black. Silver.—Muriatic acid gives a white precipitate insoluble
               in water, soluble in ammonia, which blackens on expo
               sure to light. The blackened portion is insoluble in
               ammonia.             -
    Black. Mercury.—The protoxide of mercury in solution is thrown
               down by the chlorides as a white precipitate, insoluble
               in acids; blackened by ammonia. In solutions of the
               peroxide, sulph. hydrogen produces a black precipitate,
               which becomes completely white when the mixture is
               shaken; it is insoluble in ammonia, but soluble in
               potash.
    Dark     Palladium.—Prussiate of mercury gives a yellow-white
    brown.     gelatinous precipitate, becoming white on allowing the
               solution to stand, soluble in muriatic acid in excess; if
               the solution be very acid the precipitate does not ap
               pear at once; to distinguish it from the platinum pre
               cipitate it is heated to redness, whereby being reduced
               it is to be redissolved and tested.
    Brown.      Rhodium.—Insoluble      in nitro-muriatic.    Heated in plati
                  num crucible with twice    itsweight  of sulphate of potash
                  is first
                         a   reddish mass; becomes yellow     on  increaseof
                  heat; solution  in  water yellow.      Potash produces no
                  precipitate; ammonia yellow, soluble

Colour of
the Sul
phurets.
Black.    Cobalt.—Ammonia       produces in cobalt solutions a blue
            precipitate; a large quantity renders the precipitate
            green, and when still more is added the precipitate
            mostly dissolves, forming a green solution and leaving
            only a very small green precipitate. The solution ex
            posed to air becomes darker, and finally dark brown.
            If the cobalt solution contains muriate of ammonia,
            caustic ammonia produces no precipitate; the solution
            remains red, but after some time becomes brown, the
            change of colour commencing at the surface. Potash
            produces no precipitate in this, but if it contain no mu
            riate of ammonia it produces a very slight precipitate;
            carb. potash produces a red precipitate, which, on being
            boiled, becomes blue; bicarb. a red; carb. ammonia
            a red in neutral solutions, soluble in muriate of ammo
            nia; the solution has a red colour.
Black.    Nickel.—Ammonia added in extremely small proportion
            to nickel solutions produces an inconsiderable green
            troubling, disappearing on addition of a larger quantity
            of ammonia. The solution has a blue colour, with ten
            dency to violet. In the ammoniacal solution potash
            produces an apple-green precipitate; blowpipe.        The
            carbonates of potash produce in nickel solutions apple
            green precipitates; carb. ammonia produces the same
            in neutral solutions, soluble in excess, and forming a
            bluish-green solution.
Black.    Protoxide iron.—Red prussiate of potash produces a dark
            blue precipitate, insoluble in acids. Potash-ammonia
            and their carbonates produce a white precipitate, which
            turns to grey and then green; at the point where it is
            in contact with air it becomes dark, and finally reddish
            brown.
Black.    Peroxide iron.—Prussiate of potash produces a dark blue
            precipitate, insoluble in muriatic.      Potash-ammonia
            and their carbonates produce a reddish-brown volumi
            nous precipitate, insoluble in an excess of the precipi
            tant. Solution of galls gives a dark blue precipitate on
            the neutral solution, soluble in acids, and by addition
            of ammonia a dark red precipitate.
          Alumina-Potash produces in the neutral solution a bulky
            precipitate, soluble in excess, and in this latter muriate

 Flesh-   Protoxide of manganese.—Potash produces in the proto

             yellowish, brown, then black; ammonia produces the

             exposed to air, becomes brown, and deposits the inso
             luble brownish-black deutoxide. Carbonates of potash
             and of ammonia produce white precipitates, unaltered

Alumina.-If    the alumina gives a blue colour with nitrate
  of cobalt, glucina is not present. Wide pages 10 and 12.
Glucina.-Potash produces a voluminous precipitate, so
  luble in excess of the precipitant; in the potash solution
  muriate of ammonia produces a precipitate. Ammonia
  produces the same precipitate, insoluble in excess. Car
  bonates of potash and of ammonia produce voluminous
  precipitates, soluble in great excess of their precipitants.
  No crystals of alum are produced by the addition of
  potash and sulphuric acid.
Thorina.-Potash      and ammonia produce gelatinous pre
   cipitates, insoluble in excess of the precipitants; their
   carbonates produce precipitates, which dissolve in ex
   cess of their precipitants.     Hydro-sulphuret of ammo
   nia produces in neutral solutions a precipitate of hydrate
   of thorina. Thorina is insoluble in all acids but sul
   phuric after ignition; after fusion with pure or carbo
   nate alkalies it still remains insoluble in muriatic or
   nitric.
Yttria.-Is distinguished from thorina by the double salt
   produced by sulphate of potash, which, if it contain tho
   rina, is insoluble in a saturated solution of sulphate of
   potash, but soluble if it contain yttria. Potash-ammo
   nia and their carbonates produce white voluminous pre
   cipitates; those of potash and ammonia are insoluble,
   while those of the carbonates are sparingly soluble in
   excess of their precipitants.
Cerium.—Distinguished        from yttria and thorina by blow
   pipe; and from yttria by    its  behaviour towards a  solu
   tion of  sulphateof  potash.     Potash and ammonia pro
   duce white voluminous precipitates, insoluble           ex

   white voluminous precipitates, slightly soluble   in excess
  of  their precipitants.
Zircon.—Distinguished       from thorina and yttria by giving
   with a   solution of   sulphate   ofpotash when heated        a

   voluminous precipitates, slightly soluble in great excess.
 Titan acid.—Is determined, when cobalt and manganese

Lime.—Distinguished from solutions of alkaline salts in
  the same manner as solutions of barytic salts; it is di
  stinguished from barytes by hydrofluosilicic acid pro
  ducing no precipitate, and by dilute sulphuric acid and
  solutions of sulphates producing no precipitate in dilute
  solutions.    In concentrated solutions sulphuric acid
  produces an immediate precipitate, not very soluble in
  dilute muriatic or nitric.    When the solution of a salt
  of lime is mingled with so much organic matter as to
  be deeply coloured, the solution is mixed with a solu
  tion of superoxalate of potash, to which is added a little
  ammonia: should the solution be very acid it is neu
  tralized by ammonia; should it be alkaline, by muriatic
  acid : by this means oxalate of lime is precipitated often
  with a very dark colour; the precipitate is dried and
   ignited; the resulting carb. lime is dissolved in muriatic,
  and the presence of lime is detected in the solution.
  When lime, or a salt of lime, is mingled with solid or
  pasty organic substances, the massis treated with water
   acidulated with nitric, the solution is filtered, and the
   clear liquor tested for lime.   When sulphate of lime is
   mingled with solid or pasty organic substances which
   cannot be dissolved in pure water, the mass must be
   treated in the same manner as if it contained sulphate
   of barytes. Solutions of potash and ammonia, carbo
   nate and bicarbonate of potash, carb. ammonia and
   phosphate of soda, behave as with barytic and strontian
    solutions,

      Solution of oralic acid, or binozalate of potash, pro
  duces even    in very dilute neutral solutions a white pre
  cipitate, which, after some time, especially if ammonia
  be added to saturate the free acid, augments consider
  ably in quantity; the precipitate dissolves in muriatic
  or nitric, but in acetic, even when concentrated, it is
  but slightly soluble. When alcohol is poured over the
  soluble calcareous salts and set on fire it burns with a
  red-coloured flame, similar to strontian.
Strontian.--Is distinguished from solutions of alkaline
  salts in the same manner as barytes; it is distinguished
  from barytes by hydrofluosilicic acid producing no pre
  cipitate, even after a long time, and also that, when
  chloride of strontian is heated on platinum wire in the

  inner flame, the whole flame acquires astrong carmine-
  red colour at the first moment; the presence of chloride
  of barium prevents the production of the carmine-red
  flame. Sulphate of strontian is not so insoluble in
  water as sulphate of barytes.       Potash-ammonia, carb.
  and bicarb. potash, carb. ammonia, and phosphate of
  soda behave towards strontian solutions as towards ba
  rvtic.
    y
      Owalic or binozalate of potash troubles neutral solu
  tions; if they are very dilute the opalescence does not
  occur immediately; the precipitate is augmented on ad
  dition of ammonia. When strontian is mingled with
  much organic matter, the mixture must be treated in the
  same manner as a mixture of barytes and organic matter,
Barytes.—Sulphuric      acid produces a white precipitate, in
  soluble in free acid; if it be present as sulphate of ba
  rytes, a portion of the substance is boiled with carb.
  potass or soda and filtered; the insoluble remainder
  treated with muriatic acid, the solution filtered and
  treated with dilute sulphuric.       When the compound
  contains sulphate of barytes mingled with pasty or solid
  organic substances which are not soluble in water, the
  mass is cautiously heated in a crucible till the charcoal
  of the organic matter reduces the sulphate of barytes to
  sulphuret of barium; when cold it is boiled with water,
  the solution is decomposed by muriatic and tested by
  dilute sulphuric.
       Carbonate   of potash produces a white precipitate,
  which dissolves in free acids.
      Carb. ammonia produces no precipitate.
      Potash produces in concentrated solutions a volumi
  nous precipitate, soluble on addition of water.

  tric, or sulphuric, or oxalic, the precipitate is dissolved,
  but not by tartaric or acetic. Carbonate and caustic
  potash, soda and ammonia dissolve the precipitate,
  which is reproduced on addition of an acid.
     Hydrofluosilicic acid produces a transparent gelati
  nous precipitate, insoluble in muriatic, but rendered by
  it opalescent; in the concentrated solution a white
  troubling is produced, and no play of colours.
     Sulphate of alumina added to a concentrated solution,
  after it has been saturated by an acid, produces crystals
  of alum.
     Carbazotic acid in alcohol produces in alcoholic so
  lution of potash a bright yellow crystalline precipitate.
     Blowpipe.—A bead of borax, in which oxide of nickel
  has been dissolved, is coloured blue by potash salts.
  When the salt is fused on a platinum wire at the point
  of the inner flame, the outer flame is coloured violet.
Soda.—No precipitates are produced by solutions of tar
  taric acid, chloride of platinum, or carbazotic acid (in
  the last case the solution must not be too concentrated).
  Sulphate of alumina added to the solution saturated
  with an acid produces no crystals of alum. Hydro
  fluosilicic acid produces in solutions which are not too
  dilute, a slight voluminous and opalescent precipitate.
     Blowpipe.—When the bead is heated at the point of
  the inner flame the outer is coloured strongly yellow.
Magnesia.-In      neutral solutions it is distinguished from
  solutions of alkaline salts by producing white precipi
  tates with ammonia and with carbonate of potash; the
  solutions disappear on addition of muriate of ammonia;
  from barytes, strontian and lime, by ammonia, which
  produces in their solutions no precipitates.      When the
  magnesian solutions are acid, they are distinguished from
  potash, soda and ammonia by a white precipitate with
  phos. soda, after having been supersaturated with ammo
  nia; from lithia by a precipitate from potash in excess,
  particularly when the mixture is boiled ; from barytes
  and strontian by affording no precipitate with dilute
  º
  sulphuric; and from lime by oxalic acid producing no
  precipitate in neutral magnesian solutions.       A mixture
  of magnesia, phosphate of soda and bicarbonate of am
           deposits a salt on lines drawn on the evaporating
  glass.

               25
    When lime, strontian and barytes
 have been removed by carbonate of am
 monia, there will be no precipitate of
lithia if the solution of carbonate of
 ammonia be not too concentrated.         If
the filtered solution gives neither im
mediately nor after some time a preci
pitate, there is no lithia; but if there be
a precipitate, it is
   Lithia, or magnesia, or both.
   To distinguish between lithia and
magnesia, another portion of the solu
tion minus the precipitated earths, is eva
porated and ignited to expel the ammo
niacal salts, and then treated with water,
whereby the magnesia dissolves.      If the

Lithia.--Carb.    soda produces at first no precipitate, but
   after some time an inconsiderable granular precipitate.
   Phosphates of soda produce no precipitate, but if am
   monia be added to the mixture a strong precipitate is
   soon produced. Phos. potash produces no precipitate.
   Sulphate of potash with ammonia produces a strong
   precipitate by degrees. When the salt in solution is an
   alkaline salt, (known by carb. potash or soda producing
   no precipitate when added to a not very concentrated
   solution,) tartaric acid is added, and chloride of plati
   num; if there be no troubling there is no potash pre
   sent. If a solution of phos. soda and ammonia pro
   duce after some time a strong precipitate, lithia is pre
   sent.
       The salt of lithia placed on platinum wire at the
   point of the inner flame; the outer flame acquires a car
   mine-red colour.      Potash does not prevent the appear
   ance of the red colour, while soda does, producing a
   yellow.     The spirituous solutions of lithia burn with a
   carmine-red flame; those insoluble in sp. wine are
   pulverized, mixed with the sp. wine, and stirred while
   the spirit burns.    The double salt of phosphate of soda
   and lithia fuses with soda on platinum; the fused mass
    is clear, but on cooling opake and crystalline; if fused
    on charcoal it is absorbed.    Note.—The earthy phos
    phates do not fuse with soda on platinum; if soda in ex
    cess is used the whole melts together, and the salt un
    dissolved is seen in the fused mass; when the earthy
    phosphates are fused with soda on charcoal, the latter
    is absorbed, the former remains alone on its surface.

Muriatic acid.—White fumes with ammonia; a yellow
  green steam and smell of chlorine.
Sulphurous.-By its smell.
Nitric acid.—By heating the salt with charcoal in a por
  celain capsule; by dissolving gold-leaf with muriatic;
  its salts give a yellow-red steam.
Nitrous.-By       its
                   orange colour.
Bromine.—By its hyacinth-red colour; the solution      the     of
  salt heated with sulphuric will colour the solution hy
  acinth-red.
Carbonic acid.—By inodorous effervescence; enough acid

  oxide.
Chlorides.—Muriatic acid         evolved from several, not from
   all,as   chlo.-mercury, sub-chlo.-mercury, sub-chlo.-tin;
   chlo.-mercury dissolves and crystallizes out         the solu

   acid; other unvolatile acids when concentrated act like
   sulphuric acid; when metallic chlorides are combined
   with neutral   or    bichromates      potash and heated
                                          of                        in

   acid in    glass tube, give,    as the chloride before men
  tioned,   a  blood-red solution, which treated with ammo
   nia is   colourless.
Iodides.—Evolve         a violet gas and sulphurous acid; the

               31
    The dry substance is treated with
concentrated sulphuric acid, and if no
effervescence take place, it is gently
heated and the acid indicated by the
Smell; these acids are—
   Muriatic, sulphurous, nitric, nitrous, bromine,
carbonic and oxalic acid.
    Concentrated       sulphuric     acid, when
heated with the dry salt, decomposes
several metallic compounds, such as–
   Chlorides, bromides, iodides, fluorides, fluosi
licates, fluoborates, sulphurets, sulphurous salt,
unter-sulphuric and sulphurous, nitric and      ni
trous, chlorates and bromates, carbonates, oxa
lates and manganic acid.

   metallic iodide mixed with superoxide of manganese
   and red or brown oxide of lead, and heated with sul
   phuric acid, iodine is evolved without sulphurous.           In
   concentrated solutions a similar decomposition is ef
   fected by sulphuric acid, rendering the solution yellow
   in the cold, brown-red in the heat; when put to a bead
   of salt of phosphorus having oxide of copper in solu
   tion the flame becomes emerald-green; heated with
   manganese and sulphuric in a vessel in which a paper
   of blue starch is placed ; battery with starch.
Fluorides.—Action       on glass when heated with sulphuric
   acid; when in solution neutralized with ammonia, sul
   phuric acid is added and heated in platinum with waxed
   cover.    The fluorides undecomposed by sulphuric acid
   are ignited with three or four times their weight of car
   bonate of soda, treated with water and filtered, over
   saturated with muriatic acid, left standing till the car
   bonic acid has escaped and supersaturated with ammo
   nia; chlo.-calcium added precipitates fluoride of calcium,
   which being filtered is treated with sulphuric acid; the

  lour strikes into the solution, which changes after some
  time.
Chlorates and bromates.—Heated in the dry state in re
  tort give off oxygen; distinguished by decomposing, by
  concentrated sulphuric acid and precipitation by nitrate
  of silver.
Carbonates.—Inodorous        effervescence; solution gives a
  precipitate with muriate of barytes; muriatic acid and
  water added to the precipitates dissolve with efferves
  cence, and do not appear again when the acid solution
  is saturated with ammonia.
Oxalates.—White insoluble precipitates with salts of lime.
Manganic.—Easily on being heated.
Metallic chlorides.—By salt of silver; the white precipi
  tate being insoluble in nitric acid is a better proof than
  the solubility in ammonia, as other white substances       in
  soluble in ammonia may fall. The chloride of silver is
   soluble in a tolerably large quantity of very concentrated
   muriatic acid by heat, but on dilution it is precipitated.
Metallic bromides.—Nitrate of silver gives a white preci
   pitate insoluble in dilute nitric acid.
Iodides and bromates.—Iodide of silver distinguished from
   chloride of silver by adding ammonia, filtering, and
   adding to the solution dilute nitric acid, oversaturating;
   if there be a precipitate there was chlorine; if very little,
   or rather an opalescence,     none; bromine distinguished
   from chlorine by a salt of lead, the bromide being solu
   ble in much water, the chloride not.
Metallic fluorides.—As before.
Fluosilicates.—As before.
Fluoborates.—Action on glass and green colour to alcohol.
 Sulphurets.-Evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen and the
   precipitate by chlo.-barium insoluble in nitric or mu
   riatic.

                           34
Iodic acid.—As before.
Phosphorous and subphosphorous.-Chloride of             mercury
   in excess gives a white precipitate insoluble in muriatic
   acid; if not in excess and when heated, metallic mercury
   falls.
Unter-phosphorous.-Heated with concentrated sulphuric
    acid, sulphurous acid is evolved and the acid is changed
    into phosphoric.
Silica.--Supersaturated      with muriatic acid and evapo
   rated to dryness.-Vide page 28.
Boracic.—The precipitate with chlo.-barium does not dis
   solve in muriatic; with sulphuric acid and alcohol gives
   a green-coloured flame.
Phosphoric.—When         arsenic and boracic acid are absent,
   the concentrated solution being treated with a solution
   of chloride of barium or calcium, the precipitate dis
    solves in muriatic or nitric acid, and reappears on satu
    rating with ammonia. If arsenic be present, it is re
   moved by sulph. -hydrogen and phosphoric acid tested
   in the filtered solution by chloride of barium or calcium.
    If boracic acid be present, the precipitate by chlo.-barium
   or calcium does not dissolve in water nor in a small
   quantity of ammoniacal salts; when arsenic is removed
    (by nitrate of silver giving in the neutral alkaline phos
   phate a yellow precipitate, soluble in nitric and ammo
   nia), acetate or nitrate of lead produces in an alkaline
   phosphate a white precipitate, which is insoluble in
   acetic acid, soluble in nitric acid; the precipitate heated
   in the outer flame crystallizes.       Magnesia produces a
   precipitate in neutral alkaline phosphates when heated;
   if ammonia be added these precipitates are insoluble.
   Phosphates of ammonia and magnesia are insoluble in
   ammonia salts.

Distinguished by the inflammability of the latter, and
  separated by putting into the mixture about one-fourth
  its volume of alcohol, with which, when agitated, the
  protoxide of nitrogen is absorbed.
Selenuretted hydrogen.—Colourless gas; smell resembling
  that of sulphuretted hydrogen; rather more soluble in
  water than sulphuretted hydrogen; the solution reddens
  litmus, and gives a brown stain to the skin; is colour
   less, but soon becomes reddish on exposure to air from
   separated selenium; the gas is decomposed        by moist
   organic substances. Metallic selenurets have great re
   semblance to the sulphurets, distinguished by the smell
   of decayed radish when    heated in the outer flame of the
   blowpipe; heated in an open tube a part may be sub
   limed, while the remainder is oxidated. Selenious acid
   is deposited as a crystalline net-work in the cold part
   of the tube; when mixed with a sulphuret the selenium
    often sublimes alone, while the sulphur flies off as sul
   phurous.      Sulphuret of arsenic will often sublime like
    selenium when treated with soda on charcoal; the ar
    senic is known by the smell.
Telluretted hydrogen.—Smells like sulphuretted hydrogen;
    reddens litmus ; dissolved by water; the solution is co
   lourless, but when exposed to air the tellurium separates
    with a brown colour; the metallic tellurets are similar
    to the sulphurets; heated in an open tube the tellurous
    acid sublimes in the cold part of the tube as a white
    smoke, which when heated collects into drops.       Oxide
    of antimony sublimes as a white steam, and can be
    driven from place to place by heat; both oxides distin
    guished on charcoal before the blowpipe, the oxide of
    antimony giving a blue or no colour to the flame, while
   tellurous acid gives it a beautiful green colour.
The precipitate redissolves in an acid with inodorous ef
   fervescence; the gas extinguishes flame, and forms with
   lime-water a milky troubling.
Sulphuretted hydrogen.—Colourless gas; smell of rotten
    eggs; condensible by pressure into a liquid; burns with
    a blue flame, evolving sulphurous acid gas; explodes
   when mixed with air or oxygen. When in the dry state
   it is not altered by air or oxygen; in the moist state,

  or in solution in water, it is decomposed.  Concentrated
  sulphuric acid absorbs a portion of sulphuretted hydro
  gen; it forms sulphurous acid, and sulphur is deposited.
  Dilute sulphuric acid produces no effect upon sulphu
  retted hydrogen.    Chlorine decomposes and changes it
  into muriatic, whilst sulphur is deposited. Bromine and
  iodine the same; fuming nitric acid decomposes it with
  deposition of sulphur.
Chlorine.—A yellowish-green-coloured gas; condensible

  yellow compound, which dissolves partially in a large
  quantity of water; recently boiled water absorbs twice
  its volume of the gas; the solution has the smell and
  bleaching property of chlorine; the solution is soon de

Fluosilicic acid.—Colourless gas, having an acid, suffoca

   when it is moist with silica, which adheres to the glass;
   not absorbed by dry oxides, but by dry metallic fluo
   rides; sol. in water with deposition of gelatinous silica;
   by evaporation the acid is decomposed; fluosilicic is
   given off; fluoric acid remains; forms fluosilicates with
   metallic oxides; decomposed by concentrated sulphuric
   and heat.
Fluoboric acid.—Colourless gas; stronger smell than fluo
   silicic; extinguishes flame; does not act on glass; very
   soluble in water, with deposition of boracic acid as a
   white powder; the solution is very acid, and contains
   a mixture of fluoboric and fluoric acids; forms double
   salts with the oxides of the metals, mostly soluble in
   water.    Fluoborate of potash difficult of solution; di
   stinguished from fluosilicate of potash that ammonia se
   parates silica from the latter; decomposed by sulphuric
   acid, but slower than fluosilicic.
Hydriodic acid.—A      gas similar to muriatic and hydro
   bromic, easier decomposed than these by some metals,
   as mercury; very soluble in water, and the solution co
   lourless; by heat hydriodic is evolved; the solution ex
   posed to air is coloured first yellow, presently       dark
   brown, then the hydrogen being oxidated by the air,
   the free iodine dissolves in the undecomposed acid;
  the metallic iodides distinguished from the chlorides and

  fumes when exposed to air if it be concentrated; has an     .
  acid taste, and loses by heat the greater part of the acid,
  and when dilute loses none, but becomes concentrated;
  forms a white cloud when a glass rod moistened with
  ammonia is held over the solution ; nitric decomposes
  muriatic, colouring the solution with free chlorine, by
  which it acquires the property of dissolving gold and
   platinum; not decomposed by sulphuric acid; when
  treated with peroxide manganese, red or brown oxide of
  lead, chlorine is evolved; muriatic acid produces in a
   salt of silver a white precipitate, which becomes dark
  violet by exposure to light, insoluble in dilute nitric,

  alkaline earthy metallic cyanuret will not be decom
   posed by heat when not mixed with excess of base. The
   compounds of cyanogen, with some metals, are decom
   posed at a high temperature; some when heated with
   access of air are changed into metallic carbonates, whilst
   nitrogen is evolved; others give off cyanogen and the
   metals, but most give off cyanogen and nitrogen, and

         indicate such Hyacinths and Polyanthus Narcissus as are proper either for
  pots or water; those marked * succeed better in pots.        Those without any desig
  nation are for the open flower-borders.       These remarks apply to the first 14 pages
  of the Catalogue; viz. from Hyacinths to Winter Aconites, the whole of which are
  likewise proper for the open borders.
      The Amaryllidaceae (page 14) are chiefly greenhouse or stove plants; the hardy
  kinds are designated.       The Iridaceae are proper for the greenhouse or frame, but
  they succeed very well in the open ground with a little protection.
      October and November are the best months for general planting.        Iris and                         Fri
  tillaries are difficult to keep out of the ground, and should be planted immediately
  they are received.     September and October are the best months for planting them.
  Bulbs in general, including those        tioned, may h       be planted much later.
      Ladies and Gentlemen are respectfully informed, that        the choice of the Hyaif
  cinths is left to J. Carter, he will guarantee their giving entire satisfaction.

      J. Carter requests his customers to inform him whether the Hyacinths are in
   tended for water, pots, or the open borders; also whether double or single Hyacinths
   are preferred, or part of each.              If
                                          the selection is left to him, he generally sends
   two-thirds double and one-third single, which will be found not only to give greater
   variety, but also to ensure a succession of bloom.    Hyacinths may be arranged with
   much more effect when there are duplicates or triplicates of the same kind.
