  I. On the Relation between the Temperature and the Tension of

     of Giessen*.
  IF a volume of air V, measured under a. pressure p, be sud
        denly compressed to the volume V’, its temperature gradu
  ally rises 'r° above the original temperature t°.
     Suppose this compressed air has, without further change of
  volume, cooled down to the original temperature t°, it will then
  have the tension p’ =
                           %—‘,n.    Let P be the tension of the volume
  V’ at the temperature t+'r, then

    If the di<U+FB02>'erence V’-V indicate an expansion of the original
volume, 'r becomes negative ; and the fraction 0:, the cooling con
                                                    V1
 sequent to the expansion of the volume by wm, is nega
tive likewise; in other respects the same expressions as before
hold good.
    It is known that the value of a is constant for air, that is, it
is independent of temperature and degree of density ; it is also
assumed to be ‘true ‘for all permanent gases. We can determine
the extent to which lique<U+FB01>able gases obey this law when we
measure the changes that such gases undergo in temperature
and tension by diiferent degrees of compression, the latter never
being sufficiently great to cause the gases to become liquid.
    We know with great accuracy the temperatures corresponding
to the maximum tensions of vapours, those of water especially,
for widely varying densities. The question therefore whether
a, for aqueous vapour for instance, is a constant or a changeable
magnitude may be decided by help of equation                 Vile must
of course make the supposition, which though probably not
strictly exact is still very nearly ‘correct, that the coe<U+FB01>icient of
expansion of vapour agrees with that of air.                           _
    Assuming this, the following question might be asked: If
saturated ‘aqueous vapour at t° and under p millims. pressure
obtain at (t°+'r°) and under P millims. pressure a maximum
density again, what is the mean value of a between these limit
ing temperatures? ‘Or, ‘to put ‘the question in another form:
How great is the quantity of .heat, expressed in fractional parts
of a thermometric degree, which becomes latent or is set free by
                                                  1
an expansion or contraction amounting to                   of a change
                                             273 4- 23+ T
able volume V’, which volume at t° and under the pressure p
occupies the space V?

              Temperature and the Tension of Vapours.                  3
   If an be here, as in the case of the gases, a constant number,
we should, by starting with a given tension 12 and temperature 2‘,
obtain by means of equation (3),
             n‘_     log (273 +t+'r) —-log(273+t)
                _ logP(273 +t)—logp(273+ t+'r)’
and, by substituting various values for P and r, always <U+FB01>nd the
same value for 0:.     This, however, is not the case; for it furnishes
with increasing temperatures an appreciable though very slowly
augmenting value for ea.
   In order to obtain an expression as generally applicable as
possible for the calculation of these numbers, I have made use
of <U+FB01>ve of the determinations directly resulting from the obser
vations which Regnault has especially selected in his work, Rela
tion des Ezpériences, §'c., premiere partie, p. 608, as data for the
calculation of a general formula for the determination of the
tensions of saturated vapours. They .are as follow :
                Temperatures of the n.ir-   Tensions in     of
               thermometer in degrees C.          mercury.
                       — 20                            0'91

                         1 60                      4647 '00
                         220                     1739000
   Of these tensions, the one at 100° C. and under a pressure of
‘I60 millims. is determined with most accuracy. In the fore
going equation, therefore, we put
                             i= 100,       p=7'60';
and as an example, t+'r= —20, and P accordingly corresponds
to 091, &c.                                             -
   The values of 0: thus found may be calculated very exactly by
the equation
          ¢=0-06479-1-0-O001722T-0-0000001T2, . . (5)
wherein T stands for t+'r.
   The value of a, as calculated from this equation, for any chosen
temperature T signi<U+FB01>es a mean value between T and -100°.
   It is evident that the heat which saturated aqueous vapour sets
free by the compression to a very small but an equal fractional
part of its volume at 100° C. certainly increases with the tem
perature, but in a somewhat smaller ratio than the latter. If
we transform equation (3), which was formerly employed for the
determination of a, and give it the following form
  log P= log 760                                       273 T —l 373

4-              I Prof. Buff on the Relation belween the 1
we can nseit with the help of the now known values of a for the
calculation of the tensions of saturated vapours. This formula
differs from all others hitherto employed for the same purpose,
because it is deduced purely from theory, and because the num
ber u, the only one occurring therein which is derived from ex
periment, has a de<U+FB01>nite scienti<U+FB01>c signi<U+FB01>cation.
   How far the numbers calculated by means of this formula
agree with experiment is perceived by comparison with some
examples which have been taken indiscriminately from Regnault’s
work, and which, with the numbers of the pages whereon they
occur, are contained in the following Table :—

   The differences between the calculated and the observed ten
 sions have, it will be seen, sometimes a positive and sometimes a
 negative sign, and in no case exceed the limits of unavoidable
errors of observation. Between 90° and 100° an error of Tl<U+FB01>th of a
 degree in temperature makes one of more than 2 millimetres in
the tension, and at temperatures above 150°a difference of tem
perature of only 3—‘6th of a degree corresponds to di<U+FB02>erences in
the tension of from 6 to 18 millimetres.
   As it has thus been proved that the values obtained from the
formula agree with very great accuracy with the results directly

              Temperature and the Tension of Vapoizrs.          5
obtained _by experiment throughout the whole range of measure
ments that have hitherto been made, I have devised the following
Table, which contains the tensions corresponding to temperatures
from —-30° to -1-230° C. of the air-thermometer, together with
the values pertaining to at for increments ‘of 10°. The differ
ences between these values diminish so slowly, that the value of
a corresponding to any chosen temperature may be derived with
sufficient accuracy from the proportional parts relating to one
degree of temperature of those numbers within which it is situ
ated. ' The calculation of the corresponding tension P is conse
quently greatly facilitated by the use of the formula
log P =0-3091043 + log (273 + T) + W’-__"¥w.

from Regnault's work, page 608. They are the mean values
obtained from the graphic representation of his observations.

vapour from -—20° to + 110°, as determined by Magnus, which,
it will be seen, accord well with the preceding values.

   The numbers in the third column (pp) are proportional parts of
one degree of the thermometer. Suppose, for example, we wish
to calculate the tension at 6°'74 ; we multiply 389, the propor
tional number situated between 5° and 10°, by 174, the excess
of 6°'71L over 5°. The product 677, being subtracted from
162323, gives us the desired value of a=16'1646. ' The corre
sponding tension is found =7'26 millims.        R-egnault obtained
by observation 7'25, and by calculation from the formula which
he adopted 7'36.
   By means of an equation of the form
                     a=A+B1ogn+C(logn)“-, . . .         .  .  (10)
wherein n expresses the tension in atmospheres, the values of a
can be represented as functions of the pressure of the vapour.
If we make
                 A= 13344-'2,

                 O=—0'0513,         l0gC=0'710117'4—2,
the values of a between 100° and 230° are obtained with great
accuracy. VVe thus possess ourselves of a tolerably simple mode
of calculation for the determination of the temperature corre
sponding to any chosen tension of vapour, the formula (9), on

3                 Prof. Bu<U+FB01>' on the Relation between the
account of the variable value of a, not being directly <U+FB01>tted for
this purpose.        Without employing formula (9), however, the
temperature can now be derived from the tension by means of
the values of a given in the Table.
   Suppose we <U+FB01>nd n in equation (10) to be 1'5 atmosphere, the
value a=13'0797. The next higher number in the Table,
13-1182, corresponds to a temperature of 110°. The propor
tional number pertaining to it, in other words, the decrease of a
for 1° C., is 218, and the difference is
                       13'1182—13'O797'=0'O385.
The ratio therefore is
                           218 : 385 =1°:1°'76.
The desired temperature is 111°'76, or 1°"76 higher than 110°.
   The numbers representing the magnitudes of the tensions of
aqueous vapour which Dulong and Arago* obtained from their
observations in the year 1828 are in terms of atmospheric pres
sure. In the Table given by Regnault the tension is expressed
in millims. of mercury. We are consequently unable to judge
of the degree of agreement which exists between the old and the
new measures. The following Table, wherein some of the num
bers calculated from Regnault’s observations are placed by the
side of the corresponding ones of Dulong and Arago, may there

founding it on Dulong and Arago’s original observations at tem
peratures above 100°. It corresponds with the experimental
results of the above-named French academicians better than the
formula which they themselves have used, and it may therefore
be regarded as the best general expression of their experiments.
   It will be seen that Dulong and Arago throughout their de
terminations found somewhat higher temperatures than Reg
nault ,- and this difference, constantly but very slowly increasing,
amounts in the case of the greater tensions to even 1° C. This
disparity, however, immediately appears far less considerable
when it is remembered that Regnault’s results refer to the air
thermometer, and those of Dulong and Arago, on the other
hand, to the mercurial thermometer; moreover the results con
tained in the column to which D. and A. are a<U+FB02>ixed were made
with a thermometer the bulb of which dipped into the boiling
liquid, whilst the thermometer employed for the observations
under E. was only surrounded by the vapour.
   It is accordingly self-evident that the numbers in both columns
must have been somewhat greater than the corresponding results
referred to the air-thermometer, and indeed in about the ratio in
which they have actually been found. Regnault, during his very
numerous experiments on the tension of aqueous vapour at high
temperatures, took the precaution to employ the air-thermometer
side by side with the mercurial thermometer.
   Some of his observations allow of a good comparison with
similar ones of Dulong and Arago, made at nearly the same
temperatures, and taken from their original papers. They are
as follow :—

   The numbers in the last column indicate the effect of a change
in temperature of O°'1 on the height of the column of pressure.
 It will be perceived that the differences in these columns of
 <U+FB01>gures do not exceed the limits of unavoidable errors of obser
 vation with the mercurial thermometer.          Regnault’s observa

  10              Prof. Buff on the Relation between the
  ment with the determinations of the older academicians, of even
 greater value.
     If we were entitled to employ the equation
             as =0‘06479 + 00001722 T— 0'000000l T2
 beyond the limits of the experiments from which it was derived,
 it would follow that at has a maximum at 861° which corresponds
 to the value a=0'l3892. This maximum, however, is not in
 the least degree probable.       The increase of temperature result
 in    from           com ression of a volume of a ueous vaP our in
             273+!
 a completely gaseous condition, measured at t°, amounts to
 0'277°*; and it is to be presumed that with increasing tempe
 ratures az approaches this limiting value in the same degree as
 the in<U+FB02>uence of cohesion decreases. If observations were made
 on the tension of aqueous vapour at temperatures far above 230°,
it would probably be found that a fourth positive term would
 enter the above equation, wherein T would be raised to the third
 P ower.
    The numbers calculated for a are the mean values between 100°,
 and the chosen temperatures T above or below 100°.
     If the melting-point of ice instead of the boiling-point of water
 were to be taken as the starting-point for comparison, it would
 then be necessary to make t equal to 0°, and p=4'5 millims. in.

                         log (273 + t)P—log (273 + T)p
    The values thus found can be represented between 0° and 100°
 by the equation                                               '
              ¢'=0'05279+0'O00131 T—O'00000011 T’.
    If we neglect that term in the above equation which contains
the second power of T, as of tri<U+FB02>ing importance within the limits
indicated, the formula then signi<U+FB01>es that aqueous vapour, satu
rated at 0°, cannot be converted into such at higher tempera
tures by compression, unless we impart heat to it from without
in the ratio 0000131 T to 005279, or of O'248 T to 100.            In
order, for example, to produce saturated aqueous vapour at 100°,
besides the 100 parts of heat set free by compression, 248 parts
of heat must be supplied from without.
    This variation in the quantity of heat which it contains at
different temperatures, explains why the relations between the
temperature and the tension of aqueous vapour at different
degrees of maximum density cannot be represented in so simple
a manner as the same relations in the case of the permanent
gases.

              Temperature and the Tension of Vapours.                             11
  The great exactness with which the tension of aqueous vapour
has been experimentally determined throughout a wide range of
temperature allows of our submitting the applicability of the
formula                                1_+*16,,=74+1

to a rigorous test.        Its employment, however, is not limited to
this case ; for the theoretical considerations which led to the use
of this formula for the determination of the tension of aqueous
vapour apply with equal force to the vapours of other liquids. I
have only investigated the comportment of saturated vapours of
alcohol, ether, sulphurous acid, and ammonia in this respect.
   The Tables given by Regnault in Comptes Rendus, vol.l.p. 1663,
furnished me with the data for the determination of the values
of a.
    The tension of saturated alcohol-vapour is given in these Tables
 from —20° to +l55°, increasing i11 each case by 5°. Using
 these numbers of Regnault’s, and taking the temperature (-1-) at
 100° C., the mean values of at were calculated from the formula
               u= 00843 + 000019 T + 000000032 '1-9,
 or, on counting the temperature from 0°, from the formula
               or =0'O685 + 0000126 T + 000000032 T2.
 At 100°, P is assumed=1694.-'92 millims. ; for other tensions,

   The differences are not more considerable than would be
expected, and in no case exceed those which exist between
these recently obtained numbers and those deduced from the
earlier observations of B.egnault*. A difference of 0°'1 in tem
perature signi<U+FB01>es a variation of 0'2 millim. in the tension of
alcohol-vapour at temperatures between 10° and 20°, 3 millims.
between 70° and 80°, and as much as 15 millims. at a tempera
ture of about 140°. _ With the exception of a few cases, the dif
ferences between the two columns of numbers are not greater
than that which corresponds to 0°'1 of temperature. A still
greater accordance would have been obtained ifI had not assumed
that the tension at 100° was determined with the greatest accu
racy, and that the boiling-point of alcohol must be somewhat
higher than it is according to Regnault’s numbers. According
to the latter it is below '78°'3, whilst the most accurate determi
nations have given 78°'4.
   The preceding formulae furnish the following numbers :—
                         1“.             P millims.

                        78'5             763'0l9
   From the numbers given for the tensions of ether-vapour I
obtain the following simple expression for ct :
                     DL =0'0924-3 + 0000215 T;
wherein T is counted from 0°, and the tension corresponding to
a temperature of 35° is assumed to be 763'27 millims. It will
be seen by the following Table that the tensions which have been
computed from the above accord very well at low temperatures.
At high temperatures they show a somewhat greater disparity;
with the exception of a single case, however, it does not exceed
that which corresponds to a difference of 0°'1 of temperature.
In what manner the difference which appears at 120°, and which
corresponds to an error of 0°'3 of observation, will render neces
sary another determination of the value of a, can only be decided
by comparison with the original observations. A comparison of
the new Table with the earlier one communicated by Regnault,
only justi<U+FB01>es the conclusion that there were difficulties to be
overcome in the experiments which prevented the determination
of the higher tensions of ether-vapour with the same accuracy as
those of lower temperatures.

                       * Communicated by the Author.

  l6           Mr. G. Gore on a new Gas-Furnace for
     After making a consider
  able number of furnaces of
  different kinds, I at length
  found an arrangement pos
  sessing almost completelyall
 the quali<U+FB01>cations desired. It
 is as follows _:—A is a cy
 linder of <U+FB01>reclay about 9
 inches high and 6 inches
 diameter, open at both ends,
 and with a hole in its side
 near the bottom to lead into
 the chimney; it is covered
 by a moveable plate of <U+FB01>re
 clay, B, with a hole in its
 centre for introduction of the
 crucible or of substances to
 be melted: this hole is closed
 by a perforated plug of <U+FB01>re
 clay, C, for access to the
 contents of the crucible; and
 that again is closed by an
 other stopper of clay, D. E is a chimney of sheet iron about 5
 or 6 feet high, kept upright by a ring of iron, F, attached to the
 top of the furnace.
    The <U+FB01>reclay cylinder is enclosed in a sheet-iron casing with a
 bottom of iron, to which are <U+FB01>xed three iron legs, G.        An iron
 tube, H, with a prolongation, I, supports by means of the screw
 J, the burner K and its tube L, which is open at both ends.
 Gas is supplied to the burner by means of the tap, M, which has
 a small index, N, attached to it for assistance in adjusting the gas.
    Inside the larger cylinder is another <U+FB01>reclay cylinder or cu
pola, O, with open ends, and with three projections of <U+FB01>reclay,
P, for supporting the crucible Q; it is kept steady by means
of three clay marbles, R.
    The gas-burner is a thin metal cylinder deeply corrugated at
its upper end, with the corrugations diminishing to nothing at
its lower end.
    The action of this furnace is as follows :—Gas is admitted to
the open tube L by the tap M; it there mixes with air to form
a nearly explosive mixture, which ascends through the burner
and burns in the clay cylinder 0, being supplied with the re
mainder of air necessary to complete combustion through the
tube H to the outer surface of the <U+FB02>ame by means of the spaces
between the corrugations. The <U+FB02>ame and products of combus
tion pass up through the cylinder O, and then downwards out

              Experimental, Analytical, and other purposes.          17
  side it to the chimney, the point of greatest heat being at Q. It
   is important in using this furnace that the burner is placed quite
   in the centre of the bottom of the tube 0 ; also that a crucible
   of not too large nor too small dimensions be selected. The most
   suitable way of supporting a smaller crucible is by placing it in
   alarger one that has had its upper parts broken off. If desirable,
   a little clay luting may be placed round the top edge of the iron
  casing to exclude air entering between it and the cylinder; also
   a little thin clay luting upon the part of the bottom of the fur
   nace where the inner cylinder rests.
      In lighting the furnace, the plugs C and D are removed, a
   light held within the opening, and the gas turned on full ; should
   the <U+FB02>ame blow down to the bottom of the tube L on lighting
   (which, however, rarely occurs unless the furnace is already hot),
   the gas must be turned off and the bottom end of L momentarily
   closed whilst lighting the gas as before. Should the <U+FB02>ame not
   burn down to the burner, but only burn at the ori<U+FB01>ce in the clay
   plate B, it must at once be extinguished and relighted, otherwise
   some of the gaseous mixture will pass into the chimney unburned,
   and subsequently ignite and cause an explosion. A large <U+FB02>ame now
   issues from the top ori<U+FB01>ce, and is white if too much gas is on, and
  violet or red with the proper quantity. This <U+FB02>ame generally
   diminishes and nearly disappears into the body of the furnace in
   the course of one minute: whether it does or not, the annular
  plug C should now be inserted, which will compel it to pass down
 ‘wards to the chimney; and as soon as the small remaining <U+FB02>ame
  disappears or nearly disappears, as it will in a few seconds, the
  small stopper D should also be inserted; instead of this the
  large <U+FB02>ame may be de<U+FB02>ected against the chimney by means of a
  shoot or bent piece of sheet iron until it withdraws inwards;
  the plugs C andD may then be reinserted and the gas-tap partly
  adjusted. The crucible may be placed in the furnace either
  before or some time after the act of lighting, but not immediately
  after (if the furnace is cold), or explosions may occur by unburned
 gaseous mixture passing the crucible into the chimney and igni
  ting afterwards.
      After about <U+FB01>ve minutes the gas should be adjusted until a
  sound is heard inside like a series of small explosions. This
  sound is sometimes not very distinct, especially at high tempe
  ratures, and therefore requires a little experience in the use of
  the furnace in order to be detected; it is, however, a chief guide
  in determining the proper amount of gas, and should therefore
  be carefully studied. To assist in adjusting the gas, it will be
' found very useful to placea small piece of looking-glass beneath
   the tube L, and to adjust the gas-tap until the <U+FB02>ame between the
  burner and crucible appears wholly violet or slightly white; but

18             Mr. G. Gore on a new Gas-Furnace for
this test is liable to fallacy if employed when the gas is just
lighted, because the coldness of the parts makes the flame much
whiter than it otherwise would be ; it is also fallacious when the
crucible is very hot, the <U+FB02>ame appearing whiter than it really is ;
it is, however, of great assistance at intermediate temperatures.
A rough deposit upon the outer edge of the crucible indicates an
excess of gas; the deposit is carbon.
   Less gas is required with a crucible in the furnace than with
out one ; also less is necessary when the small hole at the top of
the furnace is open than when it is closed; and less is also
required when the furnace is cold than after it has been lighted
some time, because the draught gradually increases and draws in
more air. After having accurately adjusted the gas, no further
attention to the furnace is requisite.
    Having once found the proper adjustment of gas under certain
known circumstances, it is well to notice the position of the
index N, in order to be able at once to adjust it to the right point
on other occasions. Under ordinary circumstances, during day
light I have found it best to set the gas nearly fully on at <U+FB01>rst,
and fully on at about <U+FB01>ve minutes afterwards when the draught
has become more powerful ; but during twilight, when the supply
of gas from the gas-works is more free, I have set the index
pointer at the numbers 2% or 3. The gas should be supplied by
a pipe of not less than gths of an inch bore, with a main pipe of
half an inch; but all depends upon the pressure of -gas at the
particular locality, which is very variable. The consumption of
gas varies from 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the cost of which is
about twopence.
    The top of the chimney should be placed in a position where
the products of combustion can pass freely away; if it is placed
in an opening or pipe leading to another chimney, care must be
taken not to have the draught too powerful, otherwise the heat
will be drawn more into the chimney, and the supply of gas in
the daytime may be found rather de<U+FB01>cient. The furnace will
 act satisfactorily, though less powerfully, with the chimney stand
ing in an open room without any special outlet for the products
of combustion, provided the full height (6 feet) of chimney is
employed; under other circumstances I have generally used a
chimney 411,- or 5 feet in height.
   This furnace will readily melt half a pound of copper or six
ounces of cast iron. I have melted those quantities in it: it will
melt as large a quantity of those substances as the largest-sized
crucible that can be introduced into it will contain, sufficient
space being allowed around the crucible for draught. It requires
from 20 to 30 minutes to acquire its highest temperature; and
then the entrancepart ofthe chimney exhibits afaint red heat in day

           E’:/Wei-imental, Analytical, and other purposes.       19
light; if it exhibits much more than this, the draught is too
powerful.
   With one ounce of copper put into the cold furnace, and the
gas lighted and properly adjusted, the copper generally begins
to melt at about the tenth or twelfth minute, and is completely
melted by the <U+FB01>fteenth. With the heat well up, one ounce of cop
per has been melted in it in 21» minutes, one ounce of cast iron in
3 minutes, <U+FB01>ve ounces of copper in 42} minutes, and three ounces
of cast iron in 5 minutes. With the smaller hole in the top of
the furnace open, one ounce of copper has been melted in 3Q
minutes ; and several ounces of copper have been kept in fusion
for upwards of half an hour, and may be kept so for any length
of time : ‘cast iron has also been fused and kept melted under the
same conditions. These various effects have also been obtained
in a somewhat diminished degree with the chimney standing in
an open room.
    When the small hole D is open, some air is drawn in that
 way, and less air passes up with the gas through the tube 0 ; but
 this cold air does not much diminish the temperature of the cru
 cible, because it combines with the excess of gas now passing over
 the edge of the inner cylinder; it however renders the flame
 round the crucible white by de<U+FB01>ciency of air, and this should be
 partly corrected by lessening the amount of gas. An excess
 either of air or gas renders the surface of melted copper dull.
    VVhen it is desirable to perfectly avoid the contact of air with
 the fused substance during manipulation, athin and narrow ring
 of <U+FB01>reclay should be placed upon the top of the tube 0 to con
 tract its opening; the <U+FB02>ame then completely closes over the top
 of the crucible and prevents access of air. A proper adjustment
 of gas, together with exclusion of air in this manner, enables a
 perfectly bright surface of melted copper, or even tin, to be con
tinuously maintained, from which the images of the parts above
are clearly re<U+FB02>ected. The clay ring may be withdrawn by lifting
the plate B. A less perfect exclusion of air may be obtained
by employing a narrow crucible placed rather low down in its
support. A small iron dish should be placed beneath the tube L,
to receive any malted substance that may fall. The furnace is
protected by letters patent, and may be obtained of the maker,
E. WV. Ball, 11 lslington, Birmingham. The chief conditions of
success in the use of this furnace are, su<U+FB02>icient gas, proper regu
 lation ofgas to air, and a suitable degree of draught.
    Note.——I beg to acknowledge the assistance I have received
 from Mr. Thomas Simons, crucible-maker, Northwood Street,

             III. Note on the Problem of Pedal Curves.
                         By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
   T is not, so far as I am aware, generally known that the
      problem of pedal curves (Steiner's Fusspuncten-Curve) was
considered by Maclaurin in the Geometria O7-ganica, 1720. He
appears to have been led to it through an idea such as Sir VV.
R. Hamilton’s Hodograph, or at any 1-ate with a view to a dyna
mical application, for he remarks, p. 95, ‘f Cum vero geometria
quae curvas ad datum centrum relatas contemplatur in philo
sophia naturali ad motus corporum et vires evolvendas facilius
applicari possit, . . . hac sectione considerabimus curvas tanquam
ad punctum quodvis datum relatas ex quo ad omni<U+FB02> circum
ferentiae puncta radii undique educuntur, et simul perpendicula
in illorum punctorum tangentes demittuntur, et rationem radii
ad perpendiculum tanquam curvae charactcrem usurpabimus.”
And accordingly, Props. IX. to XIL, he considers the problem,
viz., Given a point S in the plane of a given curve, to <U+FB01>nd the
locus of the intersection of a tangent of the curve by the per
pendicular let fall upon it from the point S ; with some special
cases, and deductions from it.       In particular if the given curve
be a circle, the locus in question or pedal curve is a curve of the
fourth order having a double point at S ,- viz. if S be inside the
circle, this is a conjugate or isolated point; but if outside, a
double point with two real branches; if S be 011 the circle, then
instead of the double point we have a cusp: it is shown that in
each case the pedal curve is in fact an epicycloid.      If the given
curve be a parabola, then the locus or pedal curve is a curve of
the third order, viz. a defective hyperbola having a double point
at S, and with its single asymptote perpendicular to the axis of
the parabola: some particular cases are specially noticed. If
the curve be an ellipse or hyperbola, then, as in the case of the
circle, the locus or pedal curve is a curve of the fourth order
having a double point at S. And it is moreover shown, Prop.
XII., that for any given curve whatever the locus or pedal curve
is, in a generalized sense of the term, an epicycloid. This is in
fact seen very easily by a mere inspection of thg <U+FB01>gure. Imagine
the curve O’ P’, rigidly connected with and carrying along with
it the point S’, to 1-oll on the similar and equal <U+FB01>xed curve O P
symmetrically situate on the other side of the common tangent
O M or O M’; then when P’ coincides with P, the point S’ is
brought to S", where S N N’ S” is the perpendicular from S on
the tangent P N or P N’, and S N=N’ S", that is, S S”=2S N _;
and the curve generated by S" (that is S’), or say the epicycloid

the locus of S’, is a curve similar to and similarly situate with
the pedal curve the locus of N, but of twice the linear magnitude
                                   S
of the pedal curve. Or, what is the same thing, if instead of the
given curve we consider a similar and similarly situated curve of
twice the linear magnitude (the point S being the centre of simi
litude), then the epicycloid the locus of S’ is the pedal curve of
the substituted curve in relation to the point S. It may be
added that, in accordance with a theorem of Dandelin’s, if rays
proceeding from the point S are re<U+FB02>ected at the given curve,
then the epicycloid or pedal in question is the secondary caustic,
or an orthogonal trajectory of the re<U+FB02>ected rays._

IT is with regret that I <U+FB01>nd myself obliged to return to a sub
       ject the importance of which is not suflicient to warrant a re
newed treatment of it. But inasmuch as the method which I have
employed for determining the transmission of heat through
gaseous bodies has been attacked, and since it has been asserted
that it is incapable of yielding trustworthy results, I felt it my
duty to submit it to still further examination; especially since,
during my stay in London last autumn, Prof. Tyndall had the
kindness to show me some experiments, made according to his
method, which were apparently at variance with my own.

however, a great disagreement. For while I have observed only
a very small difference between the power of transmitting heat
possessed by dry air and that possessed by moist air, Prof. Tyn

   Prof. Tyndall employs in his method two sources of heat which
are placed opposite the two faces of the thermo-pile furnished
with its conical re<U+FB02>ectors, and they are adjusted until both faces
of the pile receive an equal amount of heat, and the galvano
meter is consequently not de<U+FB02>ected. For this purpose there is
placed in front of one of the sources of heat, which we may call
the compensator, and which consists of a cube <U+FB01>lled with boil
ing water, a screen made of two parallel tin plates, by moving
which the quantity of heat which falls upon one face of the pile
can be so regulated as to be always equal to that which reaches
the opposite face.
   Between the thermo-pile and the principal source of heat,
which consists of a plate of copper heated to about 300° C. by a
gas-<U+FB02>ame, is placed the experimental tube, which can be closed
at both ends with plates of rock-salt, and can then be employed
either vacuous or <U+FB01>lled with the gases or vapours to be examined.
It has, however, also been used by Prof. Tyndall for comparing
the absorption by dry and moist air without using the closing
plates, the two kinds of air having been allowed to <U+FB02>ow into the
tube at one end, while the other end was connected with an air
pump. By this latter method Prof. Tyndall obtained a de<U+FB02>ec
tion of 30° of his galvanometer when he allowed moist air to <U+FB02>ow

through the tube ; and, on the other hand, dry air brought the
needle back to zero*.
    This experiment appeared to me more decisive than any of
those in which the rock-salt plates were used, and I therefore
owe Prof. Tyndall my best thanks for his courtesy in showing it
to me. The needle swung through 30° or 40° ; but whether on
leading dry or moist air through the tube I do not remember;
and I further omitted to notice which of the two sources of heat
had the preponderance. The result of this experiment was so
surprising, and so little in accordance with what I had found by
other processes, that when I reached home I determined to repeat
it. In my earlier experiments I had used an astatic needle-galva
nometer, because the re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer, as commonly con.
structed, has too great a directive force to be de<U+FB02>ected su<U+FB02>i
ciently by a weak current like that of the thermo-pile. The
needle-galvanometer, however, has the defect that its indications
are proportional to the strength of the current only when the
 de<U+FB02>ections do not exceed a few degrees; I have therefore
 increased the sensibility of the re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer by adding
 to it a second magnet, exactly similar to the <U+FB01>rst, and connected
 with it on the principle of astatic needles, so as to diminish the
 directive force of the instrument.
     Fig. 1, Plate I. shows the galvanometer thus constructed. It
 consists of two parallel coils g g, each containing 94 turns of wire ;
 a is a circular piece of steel placed inside the coils, and serving
 at once as mirror and as magnet. Between it and the coils there
  is a copper ring klc, 60 millims. broad and 30 millims. thick,
  which acts as a damper. This ring carries a small tube cs,
  which passes up between the coils, and upon which is fastened
  the cylindrical brass vessel q q, containing a second circular mag
  net b, of exactly the same size as the mirror a, and <U+FB01>rmly con
  nected with it by the wire a b, so that both are in the same plane,
  and have their magnetic axes horizontal but in opposite direc
  tions. They hang by a cocoon-<U+FB01>bre R R, _O'3 metre in length.
  In order to be able to put them in their places, after they ‘have
  been rendered astatic to the proper degree outside the galvano
  meter, the copper ring k k is cut through vertically to the extent
  of half its thickness. With so thick a ring this cutting does not
  injure its action as a damper. It is plain that this system of
  mirrors ought not to be quite astatic; it is, however, only neces
  sary to leave it just so much directive force that it shall always
  come back to the direction of the magnetic meridian. Its posi
  tion of equilibrium does not remain constant. Independently
  of other disturbing causes, such as the torsion of the <U+FB01>bre, &c.,
  the daily variations of the earth’s magnetism occasion alterations

 24.<            Prof. Magnus on the Dial/zermancy
 of its position. For if the telescope, with the scale <U+FB01>xed below
 it, is placed at 2 metres distance from the mirror, every altera
 tion of one millimetre in the position of the image corresponds
 to a change of 51 seconds of arc in the position of the mirror;
 consequently the daily variations in the intensity of the earth’s
 magnetism, amounting as they do to several minutes, cause a very
 perceptible variation in the direction of the mirror. No harm,
 however, can arise from this, so long as no observations are taken
 as belonging to the same series except such as are made in close
 sequence, and if it is also borne in mind that the observed
 de<U+FB02>ections have not an absolute, but only a relative value.
 Nevertheless they are always proportional to the intensities of
 the current, even when they amount to one or two hundred
 millimetres. This proportionality, together with the certainty
 ensured by reading off through a telescope, make this instru
 ment specially <U+FB01>tted for, thermo-electrical experiments.
      A galvanometer of -this construction was used in repeating
 Prof. Tyndall’s experiments. As sources of heat I used two
 blackened vessels <U+FB01>lled with boiling water, which, in order to
 avoid the disturbing effect of <U+FB02>ames, was kept boiling by means
 of steam. In order to hinder the accidental cooling of the
 vessels, each of them was surrounded by a pasteboard box, in
 which the only opening, besides that through which the rays of
 heat escaped, was a small one in the cover. The screen of the
 compensating source was placed inside its box. The boiler for
producing the steam was outside the boxes.      The rays from both
 sources passed through tubes, open at both ends, to the thermo
pile furnished on both sides with its conical re<U+FB02>ectors.         '
    The experimental tube was 0'66 metre long, and had an opening
in the side near each end. One of these openings was connected
with an air-pump ; and through the other, air was pressed into the
tube by means of a pair of bellows. As in Prof. Tyndall’s expe
riments, this air could be made to pass through several tubes
containing chloride of calcium and broken glass moistened with
sulphuric acid, or through tubes containing broken glass moist
ened with water, before it entered the experimental tube, and
could in this way be used either dry or saturated with moisture.
     With this arrangement I got, on allowing dry or moist air to
<U+FB02>ow through the tube, de<U+FB02>ections of the galvanometer which
corresponded to those described by Prof. Tyndall. But I did not
always get them ; and what particularly surprised me was, that
the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle did not correspond to an absorption
of heat by its passage through moist air, but that, on the con
trary, when moist air was passed through the tube, the face of
the pile which was turned towards the tube was found to be
most heated. In order to clear up the already mentioned uncer

                         ofDr_1/ and Moist Air.                      25
tainty of the experiment, I have repeated the blowing in of dry
and moist air alternately many hundred times; but in no single
case was the de<U+FB02>ection such as to indicate a greater absorption
by moist air.
    It would be out of place to relate the numerous experiments
 which were undertaken, partly in order to make myself master
 of the phenomena, and partly in order to explain the surprising
  contradiction between my results and the conclusions which Prof.
  Tyndall has drawn from his experiments. I found, in the <U+FB01>rst
  place, that the de<U+FB02>ection took place only when the air was driven
  in with a certain amount of force. It was found, further, that
  when the air was pressed in continuously, the de<U+FB02>ection of the
  galvanometer was not maintained constant, but that the instru
 ment gradually returned to its position of equilibrium. Hence
 it resulted that the air did not cause the de<U+FB02>ection by absorp
 tion. I suspected that possibly moisture might be condensed
 on the internal surface of the tube, and that a heating effect
 might be thus produced ; but this supposition was likewise
 found to be erroneous. It appears, on the other hand, that the
 phenomenon is occasioned by an absorption which takes place at
 the surface of the pile itself.            '
     In fact, when air is blown in at the side of the tube, the greater
part of it escapes at the end nearest the hole through which it
enters, but the air also escapes from the tube at the opposite
end. This can be seen very distinctly by bringing a small <U+FB02>ame
in front of the open ends of the tube. If the air-pump is con
nected with the side of the tube near the other end, it causes the
air to escape with less force, or not quite continuously; never
theless, if the pressure under which the air enters the tube is suf
<U+FB01>cient to cause any of it to escape at the other end, the air-pump
is incapable of altogether counteracting the motion, its action
being neither su<U+FB02>iciently continuous nor suf<U+FB01>ciently powerful.
The air which issues from the tube continues its motion in the
same direction, and thus reaches, <U+FB01>rst, the conical re<U+FB02>ector, and
then the pile itself, even when the latter is at a considerable
distance.
     Now, if the air is saturated with moisture, it appears that water
 is condensed on the surface of the pile; a heating effect is thus
 produced, and the galvanometer is de<U+FB02>ected. If, however, the air
 is dry, it takes up from the pile the moisture previously condensed
 upon it, and thus an evaporation and consequent cooling is oc
  casioned.
     This explanation at once shows why the galvanometer gra
  dually returns to its position of equilibrium when an unbroken
 current of saturated air is kept up. For when so much aqueous
 vapour has been condensed that no further condensation can

26              Prof. Magnus on the Diatkermancy
take place, there can then be no further production of heat,
and the heat which was developed at the beginning of the absorp
tion is now gradually given up again. In like manner, when dry
air is blown into the tube, evaporation ceases as soon as all the
moisture is removed; and since there is no further cooling, the
pile gradually acquires the temperature of the surrounding
medium, even when dry air is forced into the tube in a conti
nuous stream.
   When the current of either kind of air is stopped, the galva
nometer is de<U+FB02>ected in the opposite direction, because, supposing
moist air to have been used, the water now evaporates again, or
if dry air has been blown in, the water is again absorbed.
   It is doubtless scarcely necessary to say that the evaporation
and absorption take place more rapidly, and that hence the de
<U+FB02>ections of the galvanometer are greater, in proportion as the
pressure is increased under which the air is blown into the expe
rimental tube, and also that the de<U+FB02>ections are greater when the
air is blown into the end of the tube nearest to the thermo-pile.
   If the de<U+FB02>ections of the galvanometer are due to the conden
sation and evaporation of watery vapour, they ought to occur
when the source of heat is altogether absent. This was found
to be really the case, and it was thus proved that absorption of
the rays of heat has nothing to do with the phenomena.
   The de<U+FB02>ections were, however, much greater when the tube
was taken away altogether and the air was blown directly into
the re<U+FB02>ector of the thermo-pile, or upon the pile itself. The
mirror of the galvanometer mentioned above was moved so far
that the scale was no longer visible, and, with the astatic needle
galvanometer which I formerly used, the needle was so violently
de<U+FB02>ected as to be sent quite up to the stop.
   It is unnecessary to say that the air must of course have the
same temperature as the pile.
   On removing the lampblack from the face of the pile, perfectly
analogous but less violent de<U+FB02>ections were obtained. In like
manner, similar effects were observed when the pile was coated
with substances of different kinds.
   We see by these results how little <U+FB01>tted air is, while in
motion, for experiments as to its power of absorption.
   I would gladly pass over the objections which Prof. Tyndall
has urged against my method of determining the absorption
of radiant heat by gaseous substances*, did I not fear that my
silence would be interpreted as an admission that the objections
in question are well founded—an admission I am by no means
prepared to make.
   In particular, it has been objected to this method, that the
  * Poggendor<U+FB02>"’s Annalen, vol. cxii. p. 516. [Phil. Mag. vol. xxii. p. 1.]

gas to be examined is brought into immediate contact with the
source of heat. The latter, according to Prof. Tyndall, is thereby
cooled; and this cooling is said to take place at different rates
with the various gases and with a vacuum. In support of this
assertion, Prof. Tyndall quotes an experiment* in which, his
“front chamber ” being full of air, it produced a much smaller
effect on the thermo-pile than when exhausted of air, the state
in which it was commonly employed.
    This front chamber, however, consists of a horizontal cylinder
which is heated at one end, while the entire cylinder is surrounded
with water in order to keep it cold. Under such circumstances
it is plain that no one could doubt that a circulation of air must
arise, and that this would produce a cooling effect. In my ap
paratus the heat is applied from above——an arrangement which
precludes the formation of internal air-currents, unless indeed a
lateral cooling or heating should also take place. The essential
thing about the apparatus is the heating from above, and accord
ingly this ought not to be lost sight of in estimating its merits.
     I have modi<U+FB01>ed somewhat the arrangement of the apparatus
which I formerly employed, and which I described in Poggen
dor<U+FB02>"s Annalen, vol. cxii. p. 516. By reference to <U+FB01>g. 2, Plate I.
it will be easily understood. I am thus enabled to construct the
tube RR, which serves to contain the gas under examination,
 out of the several glass tubes R A, B C, I) R, and to divide it
 into sections of various lengths by interposing plates of rock-salt,
 or of any other diathcrmanous material. Each section can be
 pumped out separately and <U+FB01>lled with whatever gas may be
 desired. Moreover, such gases as would injure the air--pump can
 be passed through any particular section so as to displace the air
 contained in it. The lower part, E F, of the tube is somewhat
 wider than the rest, and contains the thermo-pile ac provided
 with its conical re<U+FB02>ector a b. The conducting wires of the
 thermo-pile pass insulated through the brass plate FF, which
 closes the bottom of the tube. The portions which project from
 this plate are surrounded with caoutchouc, as is also the whole
 length of the wires which pass through the water M N whereby
 the lower part of the apparatus is surrounded, and which is kept
 constantly at 15° C.
     In order to be able to unite easily the separate tubes, they are
 provided at each end with a brass mounting carrying a projecting
 rim. These rims being ground perfectly true and smeared with
  a very little grease, the tubes are placed one on the top of another;
  a strong piece of brass shaped like a horse-shoe is then pushed
  over each mounting so as to press against the projecting rim,
  and by now screwing together each pair of these horse-shoe pieces

 by means of three screws, the rims of the brass mountings are
 held <U+FB01>rmly together. When it is required to interpose a plate
 of rock-salt, it is placed between two tubes the rims of which have
 been very slightly covered with grease. It is of course also need
 ful that the plate should have been ground quite true and parallel.
 In order to be able to apply a screen inside the tube, the four
 cornered brass box P P is interposed. It contains two <U+FB02>aps,
 made of double tin-plate, and moveable about axles which pass air
 tight through the sides of the box and project on the outside. By
 means of these axles, the <U+FB02>aps can be opened from without. and
 placed vertically so that they let all the rays of heat pass. They
 can be closed in the same way—that is, brought to the horizontal
 position, in which case no heat can pass through.
    The upper section, S S, was 0'15 metre high. When this sec
 tion was cut o<U+FB01> from the rest of the tube by the interposition of
 a plate of rock-salt and was used alternately full of air and vacu
 ous, the rest of the tube, B F, below the rock-salt plate being all
the time <U+FB01>lled with dry air, the effect on the thermo-pile was
perfectly identical in the two cases. I have made this experi
ment repeatedly. It refutes, as it seems to me, Prof. Tyndall’s
assertion that the air to be examined must not be allowed to
come in contact with the source of heat. When the air is
below the heated surface, the latter can only be cooled by con
duction ; but, as I have shown, the conducting-power of all
the gases except hydrogen is so small that less heat traverses a
 space <U+FB01>lled with gas than would traverse a vacuum; and hence
it follows that the effect of conduction in the case of the gases
is so small as to be inappreciable in comparison with the effect
of athermancy. The only possible exception to this would be in
the case of hydrogen. But even here, the cooling which results
from conduction is so tri<U+FB02>ing as to be of no consequence what
ever when the experiments are made with a vessel kept constantly
at the temperature of boiling water by means of steam led into it.
   Prof. Tyndall* disputes the conduction of heat by hydrogen.
The grounds upon which he does so are not quite intelligible to
me ; but the fact which is alone conclusive as to the conducting
power of this gas, he has left entirely unnoticed. This fact is,
that, as already stated, heat applied from above traverses a space
<U+FB01>lled with any of the other gases less easily than it traverses a
vacuum : hydrogen alone transmits more heat than is transmitted
by a vacuum.       Since, however, hydrogen does not allow more
rays of heat to pass than atmospheric air, and since, moreover,
even when its motion is hindered by means of cider-down, heat
is propagated through it more easily than through a vacuum or

through the other gases, this superior propagation of heat can
only be a consequence of conduction.
   Another objection which Prof. Tyndall urges against my ap
paratus is, that the pile is applied inside the experimental tube*.
He quotes an experiment in which he had cemented a thermo
pile into the side of a tube, so that one side of it was inside the
tube and the other outside. When the air was now pumped out,
 a very considerable current was produced. This result was what
 might have been foreseen. But I may add that even when the
 pile is entirely within the tube a current is produced on pump
 ing out the air, because the two sides of the pile and the neigh
 bouring parts of the apparatus are not cooled to the same extent.
 The current, however, disappears entirely after a little time,
 especially if the part of the tube containing the pile is surrounded
 with water of constant temperature, as was always the case in the
 apparatus that I used.
    When the pile is situated entirely outside the experimental
 tube, the latter is cooled on being pumped out, just as though
 the pile were in it; this cooling, however, exerts a scarcely per
 ceptible effect on the pile applied externally, which proves that
the delicacy of the apparatus is now much less than it is when
the pile is placed entirely inside the tube. This inferior degree
 of delicacy arises from the fact that the rock- salt plate, whereby
 the tube is closed, absorbs, in proportion to its thickness and
transparency, a not inconsiderable amount of heat. When two
 rock-salt plates are used, as in Prof. Tyndall’s apparatus, the
 delicacy of the apparatus becomes still less.
     By using two plates of rock-salt I have, even with my own
 apparatus, found scarcely a perceptible difference in the amount
 of heat transmitted across a vacuum and across a space <U+FB01>lled
 with dry air, a result which quite accords with Prof. Tyndall’s
 statements; when, however, the experiment was made without
 rock-salt plates, the difference was quite decided. By the use
 of the galvanometer mentioned above, I have convinced myself
 that it is not quite so great as I had previously stated1'; but it
 amounts at any rate to several per cent.
     For all gases, except atmospheric air, in the dry and moist
 states, Prof. Tyndall’s values agree with my own as nearly as
 measurements of this kind could be expected to do. Hence the
 method I have employed is at all events not so faulty as Prof.
 Tyndall reproaches it with being; for were his objections well
  founded, the determinations of all the gases must have been
  wrong. There must consequently be some other cause which
  specially affects the determination of the absorptive power of
    ' Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxiii. p.              _              __

30                 Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
moist air. There seems to be no doubt that this cause is to be
sought in the employment of the rock-salt plates.
   When the absorption by dry air was compared with that by
air saturated with moisture without using rock-salt plates, as
small difference was found between them, but always less than
1 per cent. When rock-salt plates were employed, the difference
was considerably greater, and when moist air was passed through
the tube for a longer time, it attained a value similar to what I
had obtained in previous cxperiments*.
    Besides the defect arising from the hygroscopic character of the
rock-salt plates, Prof. Tyndall’s method labours under another
di<U+FB02>iculty. The absorptive powers of the various gases were mea
sured by him by <U+FB01>rst adjusting the compensating source of heat
so that the radiation through the exhausted experimental tube
produced no de<U+FB02>ection of the galvanometer, and then determin
ing the de<U+FB02>ection caused by dry air. The value thus obtained
for dry air formed the unit for the determination of the other
gases, all of which were compared in the same way with the
vacuum. Therefore the smaller the observed difference between
dry atmospheric air and the vacuum, the greater the apparent
absorptive power of the other gases. Hence, if this difference
were to be equal to nothing, the absorption by the other gases
would come out in<U+FB01>nitely great.
    In the method which I have employed, the determinations are
altogether independent of any comparison between an exhausted
space and a space <U+FB01>lled with air. For the de<U+FB02>ection caused by
atmospheric air is observed <U+FB01>rst each time, and then that caused
by the gas under examination or by the exhausted tube; so that
each time the values obtained for both under precisely similar
circumstances are compared together.
      V. On the Relation of Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.
                 By JOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S. 8;c.T
I HAVE already placed before the Royal Society an account
       of some experiments which brought to light the remarkable
fact that the body of our atmosphere, that is to say the mixture
of oxygen and nitrogen of which it is composed, is a comparative
vacuum to the calori<U+FB01>c rays, its main absorbent constituent being
the aqueous vapour which it contains. It is very important that
the minds of meteorologists should be set at rest on this subject
-—that they should be able to apply, without misgiving, this
newly revealed physical property of aqueous vapour; for it is

certain to have numerous and important applications. I there
fore thought it right to commence my investigations this year
with a fresh series of experiments upon atmospheric vapour, and
Inow have the honour to lay the results of these experiments
before the Royal Society.                                               _
    Rock-salt is a hygroscopic substance. If we breathe on a
polished surface of rock-salt, the affinity of the substance for the
moisture of the breath causes the latter to spread over it in a
<U+FB01>lm which exhibits brilliantly the colours of thin plates. The
zones of colour shrink and <U+FB01>nally disappear as the moisture
evaporates. Visitors to the International Exhibition may have
witnessed how moist were the pieces of rock-salt exhibited in the
Austrian and Hungarian Courts. This property of the substance
has been referred to by Professor Magnus as a possible cause of
error in my researches on aqueous vapour; a <U+FB01>lm of brine depo
sited on the surface of the salt would produce the effect which I
had ascribed to the aqueous vapour. I will, in the <U+FB01>rst place,
describe a method of experiment by which even an inexperienced
operator may avoid all inconvenience of this kind.
     In the Plate which accompanies my former paper, the thermo
electric pile is <U+FB01>gured with two conical re<U+FB02>ectors, both outside
the experimental tube; in my present experiments the re<U+FB02>ector
which faced the experimental tube is placed within the latter, its
narrow aperture, which usually embraces the pile, abutting
against the plate of rock-salt which stops-the tube. Fig. 1 is a
sketch of this end of the experimental tube. The edge of the

    ' I here assume an acquaintance with my two last contributions to the
  Philosophical Transactions, in which the method of compensation is de
 scribed. [These memoirs will be found in vols. xxii. and xxiv. of the
 Philosophical Magazine]                         '

  32                Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
  intended to keep the circumferential portions of the plate of salt
  perfectly dry. The <U+FB02>ux of heat coming from the source C being
  converged upon the central portion of the salt, completely chases
  every trace of humidity from the surface on which it falls.
  - With this arrangement I repeated all my fo1'mer experiments
  on humid and dry air. The result was the same as before. On
  a day ofaverage humidity the quantity ofvapour di<U+FB02>used in London
 air produced upwards of 60 times the absorption of the air itself.
     It has been suggested to me that the air of our laboratory
 might be impure; the suspended carbon particles in a London
 atmosphere have also been mentioned to me as a possible cause
 of the absorption which I had ascribed to aqueous vapour. With
 regard to the <U+FB01>rst objection, I may say that the same results were
 obtained when the apparatus was removed to a large room at a
 distance from the laboratory; and with regard to the second
 cause of doubt, I met it by procuring air from the following
 places :—
              1. Hyde Park.
              2. Primrose Hill.
              3. Hampstead Heath.
              4. Epsom race-course.
              5. A <U+FB01>eld near Newport, Isle of Wight.
              6. St. Catharine’s Down, Isle of Wight.
              7. The sea-beach near Black Gang Chine.
 The aqueous vapour of the air from these localities exerted absorp
tions from 60 to 70 times that of the air in which the vapour was
 di<U+FB02>iused.
    I then purposely experimented with smoke, by carrying air
through a receiver in which ignited brown paper had been
 permitted to smoulder for a time, and drying it afterwards.
It was easy, of course, in this way to intercept the calori<U+FB01>c rays ;
but, con<U+FB01>ning myself to the lengths of air actually experimented
on, I convinced myself that, even when the east wind blows, and
pours the carbon of the city upon the west end of London, the
heat intercepted by the suspended carbon particles is but a minute
fraction of that absorbed by the aqueous vapour.
    Further, I puri<U+FB01>ed the air of the laboratory so well that its
absorption was less than unity; the puri<U+FB01>ed air was then con
ducted through two U-tubes <U+FB01>lled with fragments of clean glass
moistened with distilled water. Its neutrality when dry proved
that all prejudicial substances had been removed from the air;
and in passing through the U-tubes it could have contracted
nothing save the pure vapour of water. The vapour thus carried
into the experimental tube exerted an absorption 90 times as great
as Ithat of the air which carried it.
      have had the pleasure of showing the experimentsion atmo

                   Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.                      33
  spheric aqueous vapour to several distinguished men, and among
  others to Professor Magnus. After operating with common
  undried air, which showed its usual absorption, and while the
 undried air remained in the experimental tube, I removed the
 plates of rock-salt from the tube and submitted them to the in
 spection of my friend. They were as dry as polished rock-crystal
 or polished glass; their polish was undimmed by humidity;
 and a dry handkerchief placed over the <U+FB01>nger and drawn across
the plates left no trace behind it*.
    I would make one additional remark on the above experiments.
 A reference to the plate which accompanies my two last papers
will show the thermo-electric pile standing, with its two conical
re<U+FB02>ectors, at some little distance from the end of the experi
mental tube. Hence, to reach the pile after it had quitted the
tube, the heat had to pass through a length of air somewhat
greater than the depth of the re<U+FB02>ector. It has been suggested
to me that the calori<U+FB01>c rays may be entirely sifted in this in
terval—that all rays capable of being absorbed by air may be
absorbed in the space of air intervening between the experi
mental tube and the adjacent face of the pile. If this were the
case, then the <U+FB01>lling of the experimental tube itself with dry air
would produce no sensible absorption. Thus, it was imagined,
the neutrality of dry air which my experiments revealed might
be accounted for, and the difference between myself and Professor
 Magnus, who obtained an absorption of 12 per cent. for dry air,
 explained. But I think the hypothesis is disposed of by the
foregoing experiments; for here the re<U+FB02>ector which separated
the pile from the tube no longer intervenes, and it cannot be
supposed that in an interval of 5‘ th of an inch of air an absorp
tion of 12 per cent. has taken p ace.           If, however, a doubt on
this point should exist, I can state that I have purposely sent
radiant heat through an interval of 24 inches of dry air previous
to permitting it to enter my experimental tube, and found the
effects to be the same as when the beam had traversed 24 inches
of a vacuum.
   * The present Number of the Monatsbericht of the Academy of Berlin
contains an account of some experiments executed with plates of rock
Ialt by Professor Magnus. The plates which stopped the ends of a tube
were so far wetted by humid air that the moisture trickled from them in
drops. As might be expected, the plates thus wetted cut 05 a large amount
of heat. The experiments are quite correct, but they have no bearing on
my results. In the earlier portions of my journal many similar cases are
 described.  In fact, it is by making myself, in the <U+FB01>rst place, acquainted
 with the anomalies adduced by Professor Magnus, that I have been able to
 render my results secure. I may add that the communication above referred
 to was made to the Academy of Berlin before my friend had an opportunity
 of examining my rock-salt plates. I do not think he would now urge this
 Objection against my mode of experiment.

84                 Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
     In con<U+FB01>rmation of the re
 sults obtained when my tube
 was stopped byplates of rock
 salt, I have recently made the
 following experiments with a
 tube in which no plates were
                                          %
 used. S is the source of heat,
 and ST the front chamber
 which is usually kept ex
 hausted, being connected
 with the experimental tube
 at T. This chamber is now
 left open. A B is the expe
  rimental tube, with both its
  ends also open,       P is the
                                             P31
  thermo-electric pile, the an
  terior face of which receives
  rays from the source S, while
  its posterior surface iswarmed        "U
  by the rays from the com
  pensating cube C’. At c and
  d are two stopcocks——that at
  c being connected with an        “I
  india-rubber bag containing      #5:”
   air, while that at d is con
  nected with an air-pump.
       My aim in this arrange
   ment was to introduce at
  .pleasure, into the portion of
   the tube between 0 and a’, dry
   air, the common laboratory
   air, or air arti<U+FB01>cially moist
   ened. The point 0, at which
   the air entered, was 18 inches
   from the source S ; the point
    d, at which the air was with
   drawn, was 12 inches from
   the face of the pile. By                   <1
    adopting these dimensions,

    kind of air may with ease
    and certainty be displaced by
    another without producing
    any agitation either at the
    source on the one hand, or
   at the pile on -the other.

                 Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.                35
    The tube A B being <U+FB01>lled by the common air of the laboratory,
 and the needle of the galvanometer pointing steadily to zero, dry
 air was forced gently from the india-rubber bag through the
 cock 0 ; the pump was gently worked at the same time, the dry
 air being thus gradually drawn towards d. On the entrance of the
 dry air, the needle commenced to move in a direction which
 showed that a greater quantity of heat was now passing through
the tube than before. The dry air proved more transparent than
the common air, and the <U+FB01>nal de<U+FB02>ection thus obtained was 41
degrees. Here the needle stopped, and beyond this point it
could not be moved b the further entrance of dry air.
    Shutting off the in ia-rubber bag and stopping the action of
the pump, the apparatus was abandoned to itself; the needle
returned with great slowness to zero, thus indicating a corre
spondingly slow di<U+FB02>“usion of the aqueous moisture through the
dry air within the tube. By working the pump the descent of
the needle was hastened, and it <U+FB01>nally came to rest at zero.
   Dry air was again admitted ; the needle moved as before, and
reached a <U+FB01>nal limit of 41 degrees; common air was again sub
stituted, and the needle descended to zero.
   The tube being <U+FB01>lled with the common air of the laboratory,
which was not quite saturated, and the needle pointing to zero,
air from the india-rubber bag was now forced through two
U-tubes <U+FB01>lled with fragments of glass wetted with distilled water.
The common air was thus displaced by air more fully charged
with vapour. The needle moved in a direction which indicated
augmented absorption; the de<U+FB02>ection obtained in this way was
15 degrees.
    I have repeated these experiments hundreds of times, and on
days widely distant from each other. I have also subjected them
to the criticism of various eminent men, and altered the conditions
in accordance with their suggestions. The result has been inva
riable. The entrance of each kind of air is always accompanied
by its characteristic action. The needle is under the most com
plete control, its motions are stead and uniform. In short, no
experiments hitherto made with soTids and liquids are more free
from caprice, or more certain in their execution, than are the
foregoing experiments with dry and humid air.
   The quantity of heat absorbed in the above experiments, ex
pressed in hundredths of the total radiation, was found by
screening 03 one of the sources of heat, and determining the
full de<U+FB02>ection produced by the other and equal source.
   By a careful calibration, repeatedly veri<U+FB01>ed, this de<U+FB02>ection was
  roved to correspond to 1200 units of heat,—the unit being, as
   fore, the quantity of heat necessary to move the needle of the
galvanometer from 0° to 1°. DAccording to the same standard,
                                   2

36                 Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
a de<U+FB02>ection of 41° corresponds to an absorption of 50 units.
From these data we immediately calculate the number of rays
per hundred absorbed by the aqueous vapour,
                         1200 : 100=50 : 4'2.
An absorption of 4'2 per cent. was therefore effected by the
atmospheric vapour which occupied the tube between the points
0 and a’. Air perfectly saturated on the day in question gave an
absorption of 5% per cent.
    These results were obtained in the month of September, and
 on the 27th of October I determined the absorption of aqueous
 vapour with the above tube when stoppedwith plates of rock
 salt. Three successive experiments gave the de<U+FB02>ections pro
 duced by the aqueous vapour as 46°'6, 46°'4~, 46°'8. Of this
 concurrent character are all the experiments on the aqueous
 vapour of the air. The absorption corresponding to the mean
 de<U+FB02>ection here is 66. The total radiation through the exhausted
 tube was on this day 1085 ; hence we have
                         1085 :100=66:6'1;
that is to say, the absorption of the aqueous vapour of the air
contained in a tube 4 feet long, was on this day 6 per cent. of
 the total radiation.
    The tube with which 'these experiments were made was of
 brass, polished within; and it was suggested to me that the
 vapour of the moist air might have precipitated itself on the
 interior surface of the tube, thus diminishing its re<U+FB02>ective power,
 and producing an effect apparently the same as absorption. In
reply to this objection, I would remark that the air on many of
 the days on which my experiments were made was at least 25
per cent. under its point of saturation. It can hardly be sup
posed that air in this condition would deposit its vapour upon a
 polished metallic surface, against which, moreover, the rays from
our source of heat were impinging. More than this, the absorp
tion was exerted even when only a small fraction of an atmo
spere was made use of, and found to be proportional to the quan
tity of atmospheric vapour present in the tube. The following
Table shows the absorptions of humid air at tensions varying
_from 5 to 30 inches :—

The third Column here is calculated on the assumption that the
absorption, within the limits of the experiment, is sensibly pro
portional to the quantity of matter in the tube. The agreement
with observation is almost perfect. It cannot be supposed that
results so regular as these, agreeing so completely with those
obtained with small quantities of other vapours, and even with
small quantities of the permanent gases, can be due to the con
 densation of vapour on the surface of the tube. When 5 inches
 were in the tube it had less than one-sixth of the quantity of
 vapour necessary to saturate the space. Condensation under
 these circumstances is not to be assumed, and more especially
 a condensation which should produce such regular effects as those
 above recorded.
    The subject, however, is so important that I thought it worth
 while to make the following additional experiments :—
    C (<U+FB01>g. 3) is a cube of boiling water, intended for our source of
 heat ; Y is a hollow brass cylinder, 3'5 inches in diameter and 7'5
 inches in depth ; P is the thermo-electric pile, and C‘ the compen
 sating cube ; S is an adjusting screen, used to regulate the amount
 of heat falling on the posterior surface of the pile. The apparatus
 was entirely surrounded by boards, the space within being divided _
 by tin screens into compartments which were loosely stuffed with
 paper or horsehair.      The formation of air-currents near the
 cubes or the pile was thus prevented, and irregular motions of
 the external air were intercepted.     A roof, moreover, was bent
over the pile, and this was <U+FB02>anked by sheets of tin. The action
 here sought I knew must be small, and hence the necessity of
excluding every disturbing in<U+FB02>uence.
    The cylinder Y was <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled with fragments of quartz moist
ened with distilled water. A rose burner 1' was placed at the
bottom of the cylinder, and from it the tube t led to a bag con
taining air. The bag being subjected to gentle pressure, the air
passed upwards amid the fragments of quartz, imbibing moisture
from them, and <U+FB01>nally discharged itself in the open space between
the cube C and the pile. The needle moved and assumed a per
manent de<U+FB02>ection of 5 degrees, indicating that the opacity of the
intervening space to the rays of heat was augmented by the dis
charge of the saturated air.
    The moist quartz fragments were now removed, and the vessel
Y was <U+FB01>lled with fragments of the chloride of calcium. The rose
burner being, as before, connected with the india-rubber bag,
air was gently forced up among the calcium fragments and
discharged in front of the pile. The needle moved and assumed
a permanent de<U+FB02>ection of 10 degrees, indicating that the trans
parency of the space between the pile and source was augmented
by the presence of the dry air. By timing the discharges the

swing of the needle could be augmented to 20 degrees. Repe
tition showed no deviation from this result: the saturated air

  always augmented the opacity, and the dry air always augmented
 the transparency of the space between the source and the pile.
      Not only, therefore, have the plates of rock-salt been abandoned, -
 but also the experimental tube itsetf, the displacement between dry
  and humid air being ejected in the open atmosphere. The e.z"per2'_

                 Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.                   39
ments are all perfectly concurrent as regards the action of the
aqueous vapour upon radiant heat.
   The power of aqueous vapour being thus established, meteoro
logists may, I think, apply the result without fear. That 10 per
cent. of the entire terrestrial radiation is absorbed by the aqueous
 vapour which exists within ten feet of the earth’s surface on a
 day of average humidity, is a moderate estimate. In warm
 weather and air approaching to saturation, the absorption would
 probably be considerably greater. This single fact at once sug
 gests the importance of the established action as regards meteo
 rology. I am persuaded that by means of it many di<U+FB01>iculties
 will be solved, and many familiar effects, which we pass over
 without su<U+FB02>icient scrutiny because they are familiar, will have a
 novel interest attached to them by their connexion with the action
 of aqueous vapour on radiant heat. While leaving these applica
 tions to be made in all their fullness by meteorologists, I would
 refer, by way of illustration, to one or two points on which I
 think the experiments bear.
    And <U+FB01>rst it is to be remarked that the vapour which absorbs
 heat thus greedily radiates it very copiously. This fact must, I
 think, come powerfully into play in the tropical region of calms,
 where enormous quantities of vapour are raised by the sun, and
 discharged in deluges upon the earth. This has been assigned
 to the chilling consequent on the rarefaction of the ascending
 air. But if we consider the amount of heat liberated in the for
 mation of those falling torrents, the chilling due to rarefaction
 will hardly account for the entire precipitation. The substance
 quits the earth as vapour, it returns to it as water ; how has the
 latent heat of the vapour been disposed of '1’ It has in great part,
 I think, been radiated into space. But the radiation which dis
 poses of such enormous quantities of heat subsequent to conden
sation, is competent, in some measure at least, to dispose of the
heat possessed prior to condensation, and must therefore hasten
the act of condensation itself. Saturated air near the surface of
the sea is in circumstances totally different from those in which
it <U+FB01>nds itself in the higher atmospheric regions. Aqueous vapour
is a powerful radiant, but it is an equally powerful absorbent,
and its absorbent power is a maximum when the body which
radiates into it is vapour like itself. Hence, when the vapour <U+FB01>rst
quits the equatorial ocean and ascends, it <U+FB01>nds, for a time, a mass
of vapour above it, into which it pours its heat, and by which
that heat is intercepted and in part returned. Condensation in
the lower regions of the atmosphere is thereby prevented. But
as the mass ascends it passes through successive vapour-strata.

 40                 Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
 which diminish far more speedily in density than the associated
 strata of air, until <U+FB01>nally our ascending body of vapour <U+FB01>nds
 itself lifted above the screen which for a time protected it. It
 now radiates freely into space, and condensation is the necessary
 consequence.     The heat liberated by condensation is, in its turn,
 spent in space, and the mass thus deprived of its potential energy
 returns to the earth as water. To what precise extent this power
 of aqueous vapour as a radiant comes into play as a promoter of
 condensation, I will not now inquire; but it must be in<U+FB02>uential
 in producing the torrents which are so characteristic of the tropics.
    The same remarks apply to the formation of cumuli in our
 own latitudes. They are the heads of columnar bodies of vapour
 which rise from the earth’s surface and are condensed to cloud
 at a certain elevation. Thus the visible cloud forms the capital
 of an invisible pillar of saturated air. Certainly the top of the
 column, piercing the sea of vapour which hugs the earth, and
 offering itself to space, must lose heat by the radiation from its
 vapour, and in this act alone we should have the necessity for
 condensation. The “vapour plane” must also depend, to‘ a
 greater or less extent, on the chilling effects of radiation.
    The action of mountains as condensers must, I think, be con
 nected with these considerations. When a moist wind encounters
 a mountain-range it is tilted upwards, and condensation is no
 doubt to some extent due to the work performed by the expand
 ing air; but the other cause cannot be neglected; for the air
not only performs work, but it is lifted to a region where its
vapour can freely lose its heat by radiation into space. During
the absence of wet winds the mountains themselves also lose
their heat by radiation, and are thus prepared for actual surface
condensation. We must indeed take into account the fact that
this radiant quality of water is persistent throughout its three
states of aggregation. As vapour it loses its heat and promotes
condensation; as water it loses its heat and promotes congela
tion 3 as solid it loses its heat and renders the surfaces on which
it rests more powerful refrigerators than they would otherwise be.
The formation of a cloud before the air which contains it touches
a cold mountain, and indeed the formation of a cloud anywhere
over a cold tract of land, where the cloud is caused by the cold
of the tract, is due to the radiation from the aqueous vapour.
The uniformly diffused fogs which sometimes <U+FB01>ll the atmosphere
in still weather may be due to cold generated by uniform radia
tion throughout the mass, and not to the mixture of currents of
different temperatures. The cloud by which the tract of the Nile
and Gauges (and sometimes the rivers of our own country) may.
be followed on a clear morning is, I believe, due to the chilling
of the saturated air above the river by radiation from its vapour.

                   Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.                 41
     Observation proves the radiation to augment as we ascend a
 mountain.      Martins and Bravais, for example, found the lower
 ing of a radiation-thermometer 5°'7' Cent. at Chamouni ; while
  on the Grand Plateau, under the same conditions, it was 13°'4
  Cent. The following remarkable passage from Ho0ker’s Hima
 layan Journals, 1st edit. vol. ii. p. 407', bears directly upon this
 point :—-“ From a multitude of desultory observations I conclude
 that, at 7400 feet, 125°”? or 67° above the temperature of the
  air, is the average maximum e<U+FB02>ect of the sun’s rays on a black
 bulb thermometer. . . . . . These results, though greatly above
 those obtained at Calcutta, are not much, if at all, above what
  may be observed on the plains of India [because of the dryness
 of the air.——.I. T.]. The effect is much increased with the ele
 vation. At 10,000 feet, in December, at 9 A.M. I saw the mer
 cury mount to 132° [in the sun], with a difference [above the
 shaded air] of 94°, while the temperature of shaded snow hard
 by was 22°. At 13,100 feet, in January, at 9 A.M. it has stood
 at 98° with a difference of 68°'2 and at 10 A.M. at 114° with
a diffefence of 81°41, whilst the radiating thermometer on the: snow
had fallen at sunrise to O°'7.” This enormous chilling is fully
accounted for by_the absence of aqueous vapour overhead. I .
never under any circumstances suffered so much from heat as in
descending on a sunny day from the so-called Corridor to the
Grand Plateau of Mont Blanc. The air was perfectly still, and
the sun literally blazed against my companion and myself. We
were hip deep in snow; still the heat was unendurable. Im
mersion in the shadow of the Dome du Goiité soon restored our
powers, though the air of the shade was not sensibly colder than
that through which the sunbeams passed. Notwithstanding the
enormous daily accession of heat from the sun, terrestrial radia
tion at these altitudes preserves an extremely low temperature at
the earth’s surface.
     Without quitting Europe we <U+FB01>nd places where, even when the
day temperature is high, the hour before sunrise is intensely
cold. I have often experienced this even in Germany ; and the
Hungarian peasants, if exposed at night, take care, even in hot
weather, to prepare for the nocturnal chill. The range of tem
perature augments with the dryness, and an “ excessive climate ”
is certainly in part caused by the absence of aqueous vapour.
     Regarding Central Australia, Mr. Mitchell publishes extremely
 valuable tables of observations, from which we learn that, when
 the days are at the same time calm and clear, the daily thermo
 metric range is exceedingly large. The temperature at noon
 being 68° on the 2nd of March 1835, that at sunrise next
 morning was 20°, showing a difference of 48°. The 7th and
 8th were also clear and calm; the difference between noon and

  42                 Prof. Tyndall on the Relation of
  sunrise on the former day was 38°, while on the latter it was 41°.
  Indeed between April and September a range of 40° in clear
  weather was quite common—or more than double the amount
  which it is in London at the corresponding season of the year.
     A freedom of escape similar to that from bodies at great ele
  vations would occur at any other level, were the vapour removed
  from the air above it. Hence the withdrawal of the sun from
  any region over which the atmosphere is dry must be followed
  by quick refrigeration. This is simply an it priori conclusion
  from the facts established by experiment; but, I believe, all the
  experience of meteorology con<U+FB01>rms it. The winters in Tibet are
  almost unendurable from this cause. The isothermals dip deeply
  from the north into Central Asia during the winter, the earth’s
  heat being wasted without impediment in space, and no sun
  existing su<U+FB01>iciently powerful to make good the loss. I believe
  the fact is well established that the desert of Sahara, which
  during the day is burning hot, is often extremely cold at night.
  This effect has been hitherto referred in a general way to the
  “purity of the air; ” but purity, as judged by the eye, is a very
  imperfect test of radiation, for the existence of large quantities
- of vapour is consistent with a transparent atmosphere. The
  purity really consists in the absence of aqueous vapour from
  those so-called rainless districts, which, when the sun is with
  drawn, enables the hot surface of the earth to run speedily down
  to a freezing temperature.
     On the most serene days the atmosphere may be charged with
  vapour; in the Alps, for example, it often happens that skies
  of extraordinary clearness are the harbingers of rain. On such
  days, no matter how pure the air may seem to the eye, terrestrial
  radiation is arrested. And here we have the simple explanation
  of an interesting fact noticed by Sir John Leslie, which has re
  mained without explanation up to the present time. This emi
  nentexperimenter devised a modi<U+FB01>cation of his differential thermo
  meter, which he called an Ethrioscope. The instrument con
  sisted of two bulbs united by a vertical tube, of a bore small
  enough to retain a little liquid index by its own adhesion. The
  lower bulb was protected by a metallic coating; the upper or
  sentient bulb was blackened, and was placed in the concavity of
  a polished metal cup, which protected it completely from terres
  trial radiation. “This instrument,” says its inventor, “ will at
  all times during the day and night indicate an impression of cold
  shot downwards from the higher regions. . . . . But the cause of
  its variations does not always appear so obvious. Under a <U+FB01>ne
  blue sky the Ethrioscope will sometimes indicate a cold of
  50 millesimal degrees ; yet on other days, when the air is equally
  bright, the effect is hardly 30°.” It is, I think, certain that these

                  Radiant Heat to Aqueous Vapour.                   43
anomalies were due to differences in the amount of aqueous
vapour in the air, which escaped the sense of vision. Leslie
himself connects the effect with aqueous vapour by the following
remark :——“ The pressure [apparently a misprint for presence] of
hygrometric moisture in the air probably affects the indications
of the instrument.” In fact, the absence or presence of moisture
opened or closed an invisible door for radiation from the “ sentient
bulb” of the instrument into space. The following observation
 in reference to radiation-experiments with Pouillet’s pyrhelio
 meter, now receives its explanation. “ In making such experi
 ments,” says M. Schlagintweit, “ deviations in the transparency
are often recognized which are totally inappreciable to the tele
scope or the naked eyes, but which afterwards announce them
selves in the presence of thin clouds,” &c.
     In his beautiful essay on Dew, Wells gives the true explana
 tion of the formation of ice in India, by ascribing the effect to
 radiation. I think, however, his theory needs supplementing.
 Given the same day-temperature here as at Benares, could we,
even in clear weather, obtain a su<U+FB02>icient fall of temperature to
 produce ice ? I think not. The interception of the calori<U+FB01>c rays
 by our humid air would too much retard the chill. It is apparent,
 from the descriptions given of the process, that a dry still air
 was the most favourable for the formation of the ice. The nights
 when it was formed in greatest abundance were those during
 which the dew was not copious. The <U+FB02>at pans used in the pro
 cess were placed on dry straw, and if the straw became wetted it
 was necessary to have it removed. Wells accounts for this by
 saying that the wetted straw is more dense than the dry, and
 hence more competent to transfer heat from the earth to the
 basins. This may be to some extent true; but it is also certain
 that the evaporation from the moist straw, by throwing over the
 pans an atmosphere of aqueous vapour, would check the radia
 tion and thus tend to diminish the cold.
     Melloni, in his excellent paper “ On the Nocturnal Radiation
 of Bodies,” gives a theory of the serein, or excessively <U+FB01>ne rain
 which sometimes falls in a clear sky a few moments after sunset.
  Several authors, he says, attribute this effect to the cold resulting
 from radiation of the air, during the <U+FB01>ne season, immediately on
  the departure of the sun. “But,” writes Melloni, “as no fact
  is yet known which distinctly proves the emissive power of pure
  transparent elastic <U+FB02>uids, it appears to me more conformable to
  the principles of natural philosophy to attribute this species of
  rain to the radiation and subsequent condensation of a thin veil
  of vesicular vapour distributed through the higher strata of the
  atmosphere ”*. Now, however, that the power of aqueous vapour
               * Taylor’s Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs, vol. v. p. 551.

 44         Prof. Tyndall on the Passage of Radiant Heat
 as a radiant is known, the di<U+FB01>iculty experienced by Melloni dis
 appears. The former hypothesis, however, though probably cor
 rect in ascribing the effect to radiation, was incorrect in ascribing
 it to the radiation of “the air.”
    Dr. Hooker encourages me to hope that this newly discovered
action may throw some light on the formation of hail. The
wildest and vaguest theories are a<U+FB02>oat upon this subject. But
the same action which produces serein must, if augmented, freeze
the minute rain, and the aggregation of the small particles thu
frozen would form hail. I cannot think the hail that I have
had an opportunity of examining to be due to the freezing of
drops of water, each hailstone being merely the ice of the drop.
The “ stones ” are granular aggregates, the components of which
may, I think, he produced by the chill of radiation. I will not,
however, dwell further on this subject, but will now commit the
entire question to those who are more specially quali<U+FB01>ed for its
investigation.
VI. On the Passage of Radiant Heat through Dry and Humid Air.
                 By Joan TYNDALL, F.R.S., <30. *
IT is known to the readers of the Philosophical Magazine,
      that Professor Magnus and myself have arrived at different
conclusions regarding the action of dry air, and of the aqueous
vapour diffused throughout our atmosphere, on radiant heat.
Last autumn I had the pleasure of meeting my eminent
friend in London; and soon after his arrival it was agreed upon
between us to subject the points on which we di<U+FB02>ered to a
searching examination.      We accordingly met on several occa
sions in the laboratory of the Royal Institution, where every
result that I had previously announced was reproduced in the
presence of Professor Magnus. Facts were placed before him
which he professed his inability to explain; but, like a cautious
philosopher, he reserved his opinion. It was, however, proved
that the results observed by us in common could not be ascribed
to any defect of method or error of observation which it was
then possible to point out. I wished very much to subject the
most recent experiments of Professor Magnus to a similar
examination, and he evinced an equal desire to show them to
me. He began his arrangements, but it was not my good
fortune to see them accomplished. In fact, coming to London
as a visitor to the International Exhibition, the numerous other
claims upon his time and attention were amply suf<U+FB01>cient to pre
vent him from carrying out his own wishes and gratifying mine.
    In the latest Number of Poggendorff’s Armalen, Professor
Magnus has published a paper “ On the Diathermancy of Dry
                   * Communicated by the Author.

                    through Dry and Humid Air.                   45
and Moist Air,” a translation of which is printed in this
Number of the Philosophical Magazine. From it I learn that
the experiments on atmospheric vapour which truck him most
were those performed with a tube the ends of which were not
stopped by plates of rock-salt. The results obtained with this
 tube were so opposed to those obtained in another way by
 himself, that he returned to Berlin resolved to repeat my
 experiments. The paper just referred to contains an account of
 his researches, and an explanation of my results.
    Operating with an open tube, be displaced by means of a
 pair of bellows dry air by moist and moist air by dry, and
 obtained, though not always, de<U+FB02>ections corresponding to mine.
 But he was particularly surprised to <U+FB01>nd that the direction in
 which the needle moved when moist air was blown into the
 tube, indicated, not a withdrawal of heat from the thermo
 electric pile, but an augmentation of heat. When dry air was
 forced into the tube, the de<U+FB02>ection observed did not indicate
 that a greater amount of heat fell upon the pile, but, on the
 contrary, that the pile was chilled. He explains these eitfects by
 reference to the absorption of aqueous vapour by the lampblack
 which coated the face of his pile. This absorption, when moist
 air was blown against the instrument, rendered heat free;
when dry air, on the other hand, was forced against it, the
evaporation of the condensed vapour chilled the pile, and the
de<U+FB02>ection due to cold was observed. From all this it is to be
inferred that in my experiments I have mistaken cold for heat,
and heat for cold, and have ascribed to absorption effects which
are really due to the condensation and evaporation of aqueous
moisture at the surface of my thermo-electric pile.
    To commit such an error, and to persist in it so long, would, I
fear, leave me little claim to con<U+FB01>dence as an experimenter. But
the truth is that some years have elapsed since I became
acquainted with the facts now urged against me by Professor
Magnus. Experimenting years ago on dry and moist air with
tubes which had been coated inside by lampblack or lined with
blackened paper, I found, when moist air was introduced, the
radiation from the interior surface so energetic as to compel me
to abandon the coating. The promptness and energy with
which these effects of condensation and evaporation are produced
are remarkable. Dry air urged against the face of my pile on a
day of average humidity drives the needle of my galvanometer
through an arc of 196 degrees, and keeps it for a time pointing
to nearly 90°, from which, while the air-current continues, it
gradually sinks to zero. On simply stopping the current of dry
air, the needle springs quickly to the other side of zero and
wings through an arc of 120 degrees, this large de<U+FB02>ection

46         Prof. Tyndall on the Passage of Radiant Heat
being produced by the sudden reabsorption of the atmospheric
vapour when the dry air is intercepted. Air arti<U+FB01>cially moist
ened produces still larger de<U+FB02>ections than the above.
   Such elfects were well known and duly guarded against.
Indeed, it is to me interesting to notice my own experience in
this inquiry reproduced years subsequently in the experience of
Professor Magnus. I never had the least doubt of the correct
ness of his result; but, for the most part, they have absolutely
nothing to do with mine. We are equally successful in our
efforts. His object, for example, is to bring the hygroscopic cha
racter of rock-salt into strong relief, and he succeeds in wetting
the plates; my object is to avoid this source of disturbance, and
I am equally successful. He, by blowing vigorously into his
tube, urges the air against the face of his pile, and obtains the
effects due to condensation and evaporation ; I, by operating cau
tiously and permitting the air to enter the tube so slowly and at
such distances from the source and from the pile that neither of
them is affected by it, obtain the effects due to absorption. One
great feature of the case, however, is, that while the results of
Professor Magnus have been known to me for years, and while
I can produce them on a large scale at any moment, he has not
yet succeeded in reproducing mine. “ Never,” he writes, “in a
single instance has the de<U+FB02>ection indicated a greater absorption
by_ the humid air.”
   As soon as I had read the last paper of Professor Magnus, I
felt that it would be useless on my part to reiterate what I had
already so often a<U+FB02>irmed, and I therefore wished to subject my
experiments to the scrutiny of an independent observer. Mr.
Faraday had already seen those experiments, and it is purely'_my
reluctance to give him trouble that prevented me from asking
him to witness them again. Next to him I could hardly <U+FB01>nd a
man whose testimony on such a subject will have greater weight
than that of my colleague, Dr. Frankland ; and he, at my request,
kindly undertook to satisfy himself upon the points at issue.
I mounted the apparatus, and left it entirely in his hands,
and he has favoured me with the following account of his
observations :—
   “ MY DEAR TYNDALL,—-At your request I have made a num
ber of experiments on the comparative transcalency of common
air, and of air deprived of its moisture by contact with mo
nohydrated sulphuric acid. The apparatus which I used was
that described by you in the Philosophical Transactions for
December 1862*. It was exclusively under my own control;
and I arranged the details of manipulation in such a manner as

My mode of operating was as follows:——The brass tube (A B,

several inches of intervening air-space before entering the cone
of the thermo-electric pile, where they produced their effect, in
 opposition to that arising from another constant source of heat
 affecting the opposite face of the pile (the compensating cube).
The differential action was indicated as usual by a delicate galva
nometer. These arrangements being once for all made, I was
able by means of an air-pump to introduce at pleasure into the
tube either the ordinary air of the laboratory, dry air, or air ren
dered moist by passage over extensive surfaces of wet glass. At
the commencement of the experiments the tube was of course full
of the common air of the laboratory; the needle of the galva
nometer marked 42°, and remained steady for a quarter of an
hour within a degree of that point. I now interposed in the
path of the rays entering the brass tube a sheet of tin-plate ; the
needle at once bounded from 42° up to 90°. It was thus evident
that any obstruction to the passage of the rays of heat through
the tube, or, in other words, any cooling of that face of the pile
which was turned towards the tube, would be indicated by an in
creased de<U+FB02>ection of the needle on the same side of zero, which I
will call the — side, whilst a heating of the same face of the
pile would be attended by a diminished de<U+FB02>ection, or even by
a passage of the needle to the opposite or + side of zero.           The
following are the results which I observed :—

made, and the air was very moist. On removing the plates of
rock-salt from the tube they appeared to be quite dry ; and after
 being breathed upon, the <U+FB01>lm of moisture soon disappeared and
they recovered their previous lustre. I ought perhaps to mention
that these experiments are not selected, they are the only ones I
have made upon the subject, and they were performed in the

unable to detect any source of fallacy in them, and they there

passes much more readily through dry than through moist air.

not have thought it possible to obtain these qualities in so high

are so well known to be exposed to numerous sources of de
rangement.

   “ P.S. Since writing the foregoing letter, I have repeated the
experiments there recorded without any source of heat at either
end of the pile, in order to ascertain whether the introduction
and Withdrawal of dry air at all affected the galvanometer. The
tube was <U+FB01>rst full of the common air of the laboratory, and the
needle remained steadily at + 125 for a quarter of an hour. A
current of moistened air was now drawn through the tube for ten
minutes in precisely the same manner as when the two sources
of heat were employed, the needle being closely watched during
the whole time.        It oscillated between + 12 and + 13, but never
passed these limits on either side. The current was now inter
rupted and the needle closely watched for <U+FB01>ve minutes: it re
mained perfectly steady at 12-"5. A current of dried air was
now conveyed through the tube for ten minutes; the needle
oscillated as before between 12° and 13°.

                     through Dry and Humid Air.                  49
   “Thus far I operated on the air exactly as in the experiments
recorded in the foregoing letter. I then quadrupled the velocity
of the current through the tube, introducing in the <U+FB01>rst place
dry air : the needle in a <U+FB01>rst experiment moved 6 degrees in the
direction of cold; but on repeating the experiment with both dry
 and moist air no effect whatever was produced. I now removed
 the tube and delivered a gentle current of dry air into the cone
 of the pile, immediately the needle moved 90° in the direction of
 cold; the current was continued uninterruptedly for ten minutes,
 during which time the needle gradually returned to nearly its
 original position. The current of dry air being now stopped,
  the needle moved 40° in the direction of heat, returning again
  gradually and slowly to its normal position. The same tempo
  rary de<U+FB02>ection for heat was also produced '31 an exalted degree
  when the dry current was immediately succeeded by a moist one.
     “These supplementary experiments lead me to the following
  conclusions :—
     “' 1st. The gentle currents of air which were caused to <U+FB02>ow
 through the tube in the experiments detailed in my letter did
 not in any way disturb the results of those experiments, neither
  would they have done so in any material degree even had their
  velocity been quadrupled.
     “ 2nd. The impact of air drier than that previously in contact
 with the pile cools that face of the instrument with which it
  comes in contact, whilst the like impact of moister air produces
 the opposite e<U+FB02>ect.
     “ 3rd. It is, however, impossible to confound the effects ob
 tained in the above experiments on transcalency with those pro
 duced by the impact of dry and moist air upon the face of the
pile, because in the <U+FB01>rst place the former are permanent, whilst
 the latter are essentially transitory; and in the second place the
 de<U+FB02>ections due to the impact of dry or moist air against the face
 of the pile are always in the opposite direction to those obtained
 by the interposition of the same kind of air in the path of radiant
heat. Thus, if the heat-rays falling upon one face of the_'pile be
 made to traverse dry air, the needle will move in the direction of
 heat, but if the apparatus be so arranged as to cause the dry air to
 impinge upon the face of the pile, the effect due to the greater
 transcalency of the dry air would be at <U+FB01>rst more or less neu
 tralized, or even altogether overborne, by the cooling in<U+FB02>uence
  due to evaporation at the surface of the pile so brought into
  contact with dry air.——E. F.”
     “Royal Institution,
         June 20, 1863.”
      In my remarks on the experiments of Prof. Magnus, I had
   pointed out two probable sources of error in the method which
     Phil. May. S. 4. Vol. 26. No. 172. July 1863.            E

 50         Prof. Tyndall on the Passage of Radiant Heat
 he employed. One of these was the bringing of the cold gas to be
 examined into direct contact with his source of heat; and the
 other was the bringing of the same gas into direct contact with
 the face of his thermo-electric pile. In his last paper he urges,
 in reference to the <U+FB01>rst point, that my objections do not apply
 to his apparatus, because in it the column of air is heated at the
 top. This argument would be strictly valid if the heat could be
 applied with perfect uniformity to a perfectly horizontal plane,
 but in practice such perfection is not attainable. The top of
 Prof. Magnus’s recipient is dome-shaped, even where it is in
 perfect contact with the source of heat, while beyond the limits
 of this contact, that is to say down the sides of the recipient, it is
 propagated more or less by conduction. Indeed Prof. Magnus
 himself states that agiortion of the heat effective in his experiments
 is derived from the glass thus warmed. “The heating of the ther
 mometer,” he writes, “ although due only to conduction and ra
 diation, involves a very complicated process. Besides the direct
 heating through conduction and radiation, re<U+FB02>exion also takes
 place at the inner surface of the vessel. Further, theportions of the
 surface adjacent to the vessel of boiling water are heated by conduc
 tion, and also radiate heat against the thermometer ”*. I have ital
 icised the most important part of the passage. Now air in contact
 with such a surface is substantially in the same condition as in
 my front chamber, and such air must more or less diminish the
 temperature of the surface exposed to it. If Professor Magnus
 fails to detect this, it can, I think, only be that his new appa
 ratus lacks the requisite delicacy. Without the actual numbers
 no safe opinion can be formed upon this point ; the probability
 is that his total heat is so small that the lowering of the tem
 perature of his source by the admission of air into contact with
 it becomes in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
    An important difference between Prof. Magnus and myself
 consists in the high absorptive power which he ascribes to air.
 He makes this absorption more than 140 times what I make it.
 I would here bespeak the reader’s attention while I examine the
conditions in which Prof. Magnus places his instruments. From
his last <U+FB01>gure, and also from a passage of his paper, I infer that
in his recent experiments the air has free access to the two faces
of his pile, the axis of which is vertical. The upper face is
furnished with a conical re<U+FB02>ector, while the lower one is pro
-vided with one of the cylindrical tubes which usually accompany
the instrument. Let us re<U+FB02>ect for.a moment on the processes
involved in this arrangement. Professor Magnus keeps the
space which contains his pile at a constant temperature of 15° G.
_Let us <U+FB01>rst suppose the two faces of his pile to be at the same
               * Poggendoi-<U+FB01>"s Annalen, vol. cxii. p. 544.

                     through Dry and Humid Air.                    51
temperature, the radiation being suspended, and the space around
the pile a vacuum. Suppose, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, the tempera
ture of the air outside to be lower than that of the pile, that the
pile, in other words, is a warm body in comparison with the
air ; what will be the effect of admitting the air into the vessel?
 The reader will more easily understand me if he refers to the
 Plate which accompanies the paper of Prof. Magnus in the
 present Number of the Philosophical Magazine. On the upper
face of the pile will rest a column of air, which is heated at its
 bottom by the surface on which it rests ; convection will imme
 diately set in, and heat will be continually abstracted from the
face of the pile. At the lower face, on the contrary, an equal
abstraction does not take place; the air once warmed remains in
contact with the face of the pile, convection here being almost
nil. Thus a less amount of heat is abstracted from the lower
than from the upper face of the pile, and hence the instrument,
which before the entrance of the cool air produced no current,
will, in virtue of the different action of this air on its two oppo
site faces, generate a current similar to what would be produced
by the direct heating of the lower face of the pile.
    A moment's re<U+FB02>ection suf<U+FB01>ces to prove that precisely the same
de<U+FB02>ection is obtained when the external air is hotter than the
pile. Supposing, as before, the temperature of both faces to be
the same at the commencement, the needle of the associated
galvanometer being at zero.       When the warm air enters it is
chilled by the upper face of the pile, contracts, and remains in
contact with that face, forming in fact a pool of heavy air at the
bottom of the re<U+FB02>ector. The air chilled by the opposite face of
the pile falls by its weight ; its place is supplied by fresh warm
air, which again falls and is replaced. Thus it is evident that
the lower face of the pile will in this case be more heated by
the air than the upper one; and hence we infer that whether
the external air be colder than the pile, 01' hotter than the pile,
the same galvanometric effect follows its introduction into the
vessel.                                         '
    Instead of supposing the pile to be in the <U+FB01>rst place of uni
form temperature, let us imagine it exposed to the radiation
from the source. This makes the upper face warmer than the
under one, and produces a de<U+FB02>ection commensurate with the
difference of temperature of the two face. Let air now enter:
it is manifest from the foregoing analysis that, whether this air
 is colder than the pile or hotter than it, its e<U+FB01>'ect will be to
 render the lower face relatively warmer, and thus to diminish the
 de<U+FB02>ection. If, moreover, the air be of the exact temperature of
 the upper face, it will warm the under one, if of the exact tem
perature of the under face it Igviél chill the upper one. If its

52          Prof. Tyndall on the Passage ofRadiant Heat
temperature be the mean temperature of the mass of the pile, it
will chill the upper face and warm the lower one at the same
time. No matter, then, what the temperature of the air may be
when it enters the vessel of Prof. Magnus, the effect of its con
tact with the pile is to diminish the de<U+FB02>ection due to the radia
tion from the source, and thus produce the same galvano
metric effect as a true absorption would produce, the c<U+FB02>'ect, how
ever, being one of pure contact, in which absorption has abso
lutely nothing to do. How Prof. Magnus releases his pile from
this apparently inevitable action he does not inform us; and how
 he can distinguish between this effect and one of absorption I
 am at a loss to imagine.
    His apparatus will enable him to make this experiment in a
 far more unexceptionable manner. Let him place a econd
 plate of salt across his tube at E E, and thus isolate his pile
 from the air which he intends to examine. He will then obtain
 the almost pure e<U+FB01>'ect of radiation. Prof. Magnus has actually
 made this experiment, and the result, expressed in his own
 words, is “ a hardly perceptible difference between dry air and a.
vacuum.”
    It is scarcely necessary to repeat what I have already stated
regarding the heating of the pile when the air enters, in virtue
of the collision of the air-particles against the face of the pile.
 Curiously enough Prof. Magnus never once refers to this effect,
though he does ‘refer, for the <U+FB01>rst time, in his last paper to the
 chilling consequent on pumping out. I think it is almost certain
that, had his apparatus been su<U+FB02>iciently delicate, the striking
effect to which I refer must have long ago attracted his atten
tion. Some conception of its magnitude may be formed from
the following quotation from a paper laid before the Royal
Society on the 18th of this month :—
    “A brass tube 3 feet long and very slightly tarnished within
was used for dynamic radiation. Dry air on entering the tube
produced a de<U+FB02>ection of 12 degrees. The tube was then polished
within and the experiment repeated: the de<U+FB02>ection by dryaip
was instantly reduced to 7'5 degrees.
    “The rock-salt plate at the end of this tube was removed, and
a lining of black paper 2 feet long was introduced within it.
The tube was again closed, and the experiment of allowing dry
air to enter it was repeated.    The de<U+FB02>ections in three successive
experiments rose from 7°'5 to
                            80°, 81°, 80°,
and this result might be obtained as long as the lining was per..
mitted to remain within the tube.
   “ The plate of rock-salt was again removed, and the length of
the lining was reduced to a foot; the dynamic radiation on the

                     tlzrougk Dry and Humid Air.                      53
   entrance of dry air produced in three successive experiments
  the de<U+FB02>ections
                             76°, 74°, 75°.
      “The plate was again removed and the lining reduced to three
  inches in length ,- the de<U+FB02>ections obtained in two successive ex
  periments were                                '
                 .              66°, 65°.
      “Finally, the lining was reduced to a ring only 1% inch in
  width; the dynamic radiation from this small surface gave, in
 three successive trials, the de<U+FB02>ections
                           60°, 56°, 56°-5.
     “ The lining was then entirely removed ; and the de<U+FB02>ection in
 stantly fell to
                                  7°'5 .
     “In the foregoing experiments the lining was <U+FB01>rst heated by
 the collision of the air, and it then radiated its heat through a
 thick plate of rock-salt against the pile. The effect of the heat
 was enfeebled by distance, by re<U+FB02>exion from the surface of the
salt, and by partial absorption. Still we see the radiation thus
 weakened competent to drive the needle almost through the
quadrant of a circle. Suppose, instead of being thus separated
from the lining, the face of the pile itself to form part of the inner
surface of the tube, receiving there the direct impact of the parti
cles of air ; of course the de<U+FB02>ections then obtained would be far
greater than the highest of those above recorded. I do not doubt
the possibility of causing the needle of my galvanometer, sub
jected to such an action, to swing through an arc of 1000 degrees ;
and it is my reluctance to derange the magnetism of my needle
that prevents me from making the experiment” *.
    Professor Magnus refers to the agreement which subsists
between his results and mine in the case of the more powerfully
acting gases, in proof of the correctness of his mode of experi
ment. The agreement, however, is not such as to warrant
the conclusion drawn from it. The case may be illustrated by
reference to a delicate chemists’ balance as compared with one
of those used in common life. Weighing pounds, both balances
would roughly agree, but in weighing milligrammes the coarser
balance would infallibly fail. I think it vain to expect a correct
determination in any case requiring great delicacy with the
apparatus which Prof. Magnus employs.
    Prof. Magnus again refers to the hygroscopic character of
    * When the pile was placed entirely within the tube (as Prof. Magnus
places it), a single stroke of the pump in exhausting drove the needle
through an arc of 115 degrees.

54     On the Passage of Radiant Heat through Dry and Humid Air.
rock-salt.     This is admitted.    His experiments on this sub
 stance are quite correct; but they have no bearing upon mine.
 During our joint experiments, and while the humid air, whose
 absorption produced a de<U+FB02>ection of 43 degrees of my galva
 nometer, was still in the experimental tube, the rock-salt plates
 were detached and placed in the hands of Prof. Magnus. He saw
 no moisture, and he expressed himself satis<U+FB01>ed that there was
 none. I may add that there is the strongest reason to believe
 that the substance as a liquid <U+FB01>lm, even if such existed, would
not exert any greater action than the same <U+FB01>lm as vapour.
 However, the <U+FB01>lm did not exist, and it is therefore useless to
speculate about it. Prof. Magnus <U+FB01>nds another di<U+FB01>iculty in the
fact that I make air my unit, and refer the action of all other
gases to this unit.     There is, I submit, no more “di<U+FB02>iculty”
here than in the tables of atomic weights, where hydrogen is
taken as the unit. My object was, and is, to make radiant heat
an explorer of molecular condition; and my results seem to me
more instructive and emphatic as I presented them than if I
had followed the common method pursued by Prof. Magnus.
The difficulty referred to does not touch the method of ex
periment at all, but merely my way of presenting the results
obtained by that method.
    In conclusion, I would refer the reader, for additional proofs
of the action of atmospheric vapour upon radiant heat, to a reprint
of a short memoir from the Philosophical Transactions in the pre
sent Number of the Philosophical Magazine. Iwill not dwell upon
this paper, as the competent reader will draw his own conclusions
from it. I may add that, in the paper presented to the Royal
Society last Thursday, the action of all the vapours which I have
examined is compared with that of the liquids from which these
vapours are derived. The order of absorption of vapours and
liquids is precisely the same. At the bottom of the list stands
water, as the most opake liquid examined. It would form a
most remarkable exception to what, so far as I can see, is a
general law, if the vapour of this liquid proved so ineffectual as
the experiments of Prof. Magnus make it to be. _One word
with reference to the importance of this subject. In a certain
sense Prof. Magnus is quite right in rating it low. It derives
its importance from the accident that aqueous vapour is every
where present in our atmosphere, and from the fact that, for the
future, the proved action of this vapour must form one of the
chief foundation-stones of the science of meteorology.

              VII. On the Discovery of the Metal Thallium.
                    By WILLIAM Caoonns, F.R.S.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
   MAY I request you to give me an opportunity of replying to
            certain accusations recently made against me by M.
  Lamy in reference to this subject?
      Chemists are doubtless aware that my title to the discovery of
  the metallic nature of thallium has been disputed by M. Lamy,
  and that he has been supported in this position by eminent
  scienti<U+FB01>c men in France.       It has been stated, both in M. Dumas’
  report to the Academic des Sciences*, and even more pointedly
  in M. Lamy’s recent memoir 1', that I <U+FB01>rst obtained a knowledge
  of the metallic nature of thallium from M. Lamy, and that I
  appropriated that knowledge as my own. I should gladly have
  abstained from any controversy as to the mere question of priority
 in the discovery or publication of this fact, and am well content
 with the recognition of my claims which has been accorded to
 me by English chemists; but the purport of the above state
 ments is of such a nature that it becomes necessary for me, both
 from regard for my own credit and from respect to those who
 have acknowledged my title to the original discovery of thallium
 and of its metallic nature, to show that the accusations above
 referred to are unfounded.
     Your readers may remember that I published in this Journal,
in April 1861, a paper “On the Existence of a new Element,
probably of the Sulphur Group,” and in May following, “ Further
Remarks on the supposed New Metalloid”I. From that time
my attention was almost exclusively directed to the further elu
cidation of the chemical history of the new element ; and about
the middle of April 1862 it was arranged that I should exhibit
some specimens of thallium and its compounds in the Interna
tional Exhibition         My intention was to have exhibited a large
series of specimens; but as I had not been able to meet with

56    Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal T/zallium.
any abundant source of thallium, my scanty store proved too
limited for dividing into more than three portions. Consequently
I was only able to p1'epare specimens of the metal itself, of its oxide
and sulphide. These were displayed, at the opening of the Ex
hibition on May 1, 1862, in a case with the label “ Thallium, a
new metallic element, discovered by means of spectrum analysis,”
and with a card on which was written “Chemical reactions of
thallium, by which it is distinguished from every other known ele
ment. It appears to have the character of a heavy metal, forming
compounds which are volatile below a red heat. It is reducedfrom its
acid solutions by zinc in the form of a dense black powder, di<U+FB02>icultly
soluble in hydrochloric acid, readily soluble in nitric acid,” Eye.
    On the 7th of June following, being at the Exhibition, I learnt
from Mr. Quin that a M. Lamy had just been to him, in com
pany with M. Balard, and shown him an ingot of thallium. He
had taken them to my case (Class II. No. 634) and translated to
them the labels, whereupon M. Lamy remarked that the sub
stance exhibited by me as thallium was not the metal but its
sulphide*.
   Two days afterwards, the 9th of June, I was introduced to
M. Lamy at Dr. Hofmann’s house, and on that occasion <U+FB01>rst
saw the ingot of thallium described to me by Mr. Quin. Our
intercourse was, however, con<U+FB01>ned to a few complimentary
phrases, since M. Lamy could not speak a word of English, and
my ability to converse in French was very limited. But it
became evident to me that M. Lamy was working diligently on
the same subject that had occupied my attention during the past
year, and that it was necessary for me to take immediate steps
to make known the results I had obtained, without waiting, as I
had intended, until the investigation was complete.

I took them both to your case and showed them your specimens, particu
larly pointing out the one marked metallic thallium, and translatin the
label to them. There can he therefore no possible doubt of M. -amy
having seen your casecontaining thallium described as a metallic body long
before you could have been aware either of his presence in England, or of
his having made the same discovery as yourself.

   With this view I communicated with Dr. Wm. Allen Miller*,
and, acting on his recommendation, sent in to the Royal Society a
statement of my results, under the title “ Preliminary Researches
on Thallium.” This paper was read on the 19th of June, 1862.
    On the 23rd of June a paper was read at the Academic des
Sciences by M. Lamy, “On the Existence of a New Metal,
Thallium,” in which he stated that three months previously he

    “ Dnan. Sm,-I called upon you yesterday, but was unfortunate enough
to <U+FB01>nd you away. My object was to ask your advice about ‘ thallium.’ I
have been hard at work on the subject for six or eight months past, and
have found out a great deal about it, and, indeed, have a ‘Preliminar
Note on Thallium ’ nearly <U+FB01>nished, which I was going to send to the Royal
Society in a week or so. Not suspecting that anyone else was working on
the same subject, I purposely avoided publishing any of my recent results,
in the hope of giving the Royal Society paper more importance; and for
 the same reason I have not spoken much about them.              I can, however,
 prove by witnesses that I obtained thallium in the pure metallic state as
 early as January in this year, and several other salts of it soon after. I was
 therefore much astonished to <U+FB01>nd, on Monday last, that M. Lamy had
 been working on the same subject; and from the much larger quantity of
 material at his disposal, I am pretty certain that in his memoir recently
 sent to the Society at Lille, he has anticipated most, if not all, of my results,
 and most likely has gone much further than I have. I therefore wish to ask
 you, both as a friend as well as in your official connexion with the Royal
 Society, what I had better do under these circumstances. Shall I still send
 in my imperfect note with the knowledge that a more perfect paper on the
 same subject has already been communicated to another Society, or shall I
 withhold my present paper until M. Lamy’s is published, and then see if I
 can supply any fact which he may not have found out? I have worked
 long and hard on this subject, and cannot help feeling annoyed at the
 prospect of losing the greater part of the credit of the discovery.

  announced, I dare say. but will no doubt appear at full in the ‘ Proceed

  wi I not prevent you from giving a full paper if afterwards it should seem

 be desirable.

     “ W, Crookes, Esq.”                             “ WM. ALLEN MILLER.”

 58     Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal Tliallium.
 had discovered a green band in the spectrum without knowing
 that I had observed the same fact <U+FB01>fteen months before. He
 mentioned that I had shown this green band to be due to the
 presence of a new element, to which I had given the name of
 thallium, and added that the small quantity of material on which
 I operated did not admit of my isolating the element and
 ascertaining its true nature.
     In a communication made to the Société Impériale at Lille
 on the 16th of May, 1862*, he also described thallium to be a
 metal, and, referring to my papers of 1861, stated that the black
powder which I regarded as thallium was nothing but sulphide
 of thallium.
    In regard to this statement, I must, in the <U+FB01>rst place, point
 out that M. Lamy entirely ignores the fact of my having exhi
 bited thallium as a metal on the It of May, 1862, and of having
 then described it as a “heavy metal, reduced from its acid solu
 tions by zinc in the form of a dense black powder.” The labels
in my case were unmistakeably clear and de<U+FB01>nite in their word
 ing ; the metallic nature of thallium was both stated and implied
 by all of them; they did not leave the least possibility for the
 supposition that I considered thallium to be a metalloid; and the
publication was in every respect as full as the reading of a paper
 at a provincial scienti<U+FB01>c society.
    These, then, are the real facts of the case. As to the question
of priority, I would submit that there can be no doubt. Even
on the showing of M. Lamy and his friends, I was prior to him
in every step of the discovery. M. Lamy claims to have <U+FB01>rst
noticed the presence of the green band in the spectrum in April
1862 ; whilst I had discovered it thirteen months previously, and
published a description of the substance by which it was produced.
    M. Lamy claims to have isolated thallium in the interval
between the 2nd and the 16th of May, 1862, and states that he
for the <U+FB01>rst time exhibited the metal at Lille on the latter date'|' ,
whilst I isolated thallium in September 1861, and exhibited it as
a metal on the 1st of May, 1862.
    Still, M. Dumas, in reporting on the subject to the Academy,
has stated that the history of the discovery of thallium presents
two authentic dates—the 30th of March 1861, when Mr. Crookes
announced the existence of a new elementary substance, and the
   * Ann. de Chim. et de Phys. before quoted.
   1~ The following extract from the register of the procés-verbaua: of the
Société Impériale des Sciences, de l’Agriculture et des Arts, at Lille, is
given by M. Lamy as the earliest notice of his discovery :—
   “At the meeting of the 16th of May, 1862, under the presidency of M.
Lamy, M. Lamy announced to the Society that he had succeeded in isolating
thallium by decomposing with a voltaic battery the yellow crystalline com
pound of which he had spoken at the meeting on the 2nd of May.’-’

  Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal Thallium.           59
16th1of May,_ 1862, when M. Lamy made known the new
meta .
   Here, again, the publication of this fact by myself on the 1st of
May, 1862, is ignored, and M. Dumas remarks, “ No one could
dispute that M. Lamy was the <U+FB01>rst to isolate thallium, and so to
demonstrate that it is a true metal, and not a metalloid, as supposed
by Mr. Crookes, who never obtained it uncombined and pure.”
    But notwithstanding these facts, M. Lamy has since stated
that the <U+FB01>rst time I described thallium as a metal was in my
communication to the Royal Society in June ; and still ignoring
my publication of that fact on the 1st of May, he repeats the
statement that I was ignorant of this fact until June, and then
he declares it was communicated to me by himself.
    It may be that, when M. Lamy read his paper to the Société
Impériale at Lille on the 16th of May, he was ignorant that I
regarded thallium as a metal ; but he must have been aware of
this when he read his paper to the Academy in June, after
having visited the Exhibition and seen the labels attached to my
specimens, for Mr. Quin took the trouble to explain them to
him. In proof of this, I may also refer to the account M. Lamy
gives of his motive for coming to London in June 1862, viz.,
“to ascertain for himself what results I had obtained, before
announcing to the Academy a discovery he was no longer certain
of having made.” Why this doubt, I may ask? He says he
had heard my thallium was in the Exhibition. M. Lamy has
not claimed the discovery of thallium itself; he only claims to
have been the <U+FB01>rst to isolate it, and to ascertain it to be a metal.
This is the discovery as to which he was in doubt whether he
had not been anticipated; and his visit to the Exhibition gave
him ample opportunity for learning that he had been antici
pated both in the discovery and in the publication of it. And
yet, with the full knowledge of what he saw there written, he now
has the hardihood to assert that I was ignorant of the metallic
nature of thallium until he told me.
   But M. Lamy will not recognize the evidence which he saw
in the Exhibition, that I regarded thallium as a metal, and had
so described it since the 1st of May, 1862. He still maintains
that, before he showed his piece of thallium in June, no one in
England had seen thallium; that the substance I exhibited
“ was not thallium, and could not be thallium,” but only a black
powder to which I gave that name. He says, no one knew it
was a metal; that chemists even doubted its existence as an
 elementary substance; that I <U+FB01>rst learnt from him that it was
 a metal, and that having done so I hastened to communicate to
 the Royal Society a statement of nearly all the properties of
 thallium he had described to me.

 60    Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal Tballium.
    The question now, therefore, is scarcely one of mere priority
 in the discovery or the publication of a fact, but a question of
 common honesty. It is not so much whether I knew thallium
 to be a metal in May, but whether I stole that knowledge from
 M. Lamy in June.
   ‘The fact that M. Lamy dates his <U+FB01>rst publication of the
 metallic nature of thallium as having been made on the 16th of
 May, would be in itself a su<U+FB01>icient proof that this accusation is
 unfounded, since I had publicly described thallium as a metal on
 the 1st of May, before having heard of M. Lamy’s existence, or
 having the most remote suspicion that any one ut myself was
 working on the same subject. M. Lamy, however, not only
 ignores this fact, but also asserts that the substance then exhi
bited by me was not thallium. By what authority he does so is
 not stated. If it be for the same reason that in his paper of the
 16th of May he declared the substance which I regarded as
thallium to be nothing but sulphide, he makes the statement now,
as he made it then, upon very insu<U+FB01>icient grounds. I am unable
to perceive why M. Lamy should assume that the powder exhi
bited as thallium on the 1st of May, 1862, was obtained by pre
cipitation with sulphuretted hydrogen, and not the powder pre
cipitated by zinc, and actually so described on the label in
the case as well as in my <U+FB01>rst paper i11 1861*. It is only
by means of this assumption that M. Lamy’s assertion can
be of any value; and that this assumption is totally gratuitous
and unfounded will, I trust, be apparent to any one who compares
the reactions of thallium described by me in this Journal in
April 1861, with the brief account written on my labels in the
Exhibition.
   But really this has little to do with the question at issue. It
is of no importance whether the body which I had ticketed
“thallium, a new metallic element,” was in the state of powder
or lump, pure or impure, or, indeed, whether or not there was
any thallium at all in it. M. Lamy cannot deny that the label,
at all events, was there publicly exhibited from the 1st of May;
and that, I maintain, is ample publication of the fact that I knew
thallium to be a “ metallic element” from my own independent
researches.
   Fortunately I am able to bring forward positive evidence that
long before May 1862 I knew thallium to be a metal, and had
obtained it in a melted metallic state, and by electrolysis so far
back as January 1862, even before M. Lamy had seen the green
band in the spectrum.
   When it was <U+FB01>rst suggested that I should exhibit illustrations
of thallium, I prepared a set of labels for the purpose; and
                          * See note, p. 62.

      Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal Thallium.               61
 though these labels and their history, as given below*, might
 not be worth much in a question of mere priority, I do not
 doubt that they will be useful in regard to the question whether
 the metallic nature of thallium was known to me before M. Lamy
 came to London in June, or whether that knowledge was then
 <U+FB01>rst obtained by me from M. Lamy. I may appeal to any
 chemist to say whether these labels do not prove that the writer
 hadaperfect knowledge of the metallic nature of thallium at the
 time the order for them was given to Messrs. Silverlock.
      I can also refer to the testimony of persons who saw metallic
 thallium in my laboratory in January 1862, long before M.

   “ MY DEAR Sra,—I well remember paying you a visit in January last
to see the ‘thallium ’ you had then got into a more de<U+FB01>nite shape. As I
had seen its reaction in the spectroscope many months before, and was
much interested in the remarkable discovery, I felt great pleasure in
watching the progress you had then made in the investigation.
   “ You had several compounds of the body, including, if I remember
rightly, the sulphide (of which I possess a specimen), and the oxide which
you had obtained in crystals. The quantity of material you had, however,
was but small; and it was only by exercising the greatest amount of inge
nuity that you were able to demonstrate the nature of its compounds.
   “The most interesting point, I well remember, was the metal itself,
deposited by means of a weak galvanic current,—<U+FB01>rst on a bar of copper,

  62    Mr. W. Crookes on the Discovery of the Metal Thallium.
     In addition to this positive evidence, I will also refer to the pro
  babilities of the case. Though M. Lamy’s results were said to be
 obtained within the short space of one month, both he and his
 friends assume that, during the whole year that elapsed between
 my <U+FB01>rst publications on thallium and the exhibition of the spe
 cimens in 1862, I had either ceased to work on the subject, or
 that my knowledge of the element had not advanced one step
 between May 1861 and May 1862; that the black powder I
 exhibited as thallium was obtained by precipitating with hydro
 sulphuric acid, not the black powder described as precipitated
 by zinc *. They assume that because at the former date I was,
 though doubtful as to the point, inclined to class thallium with
 the semimetals, therefore at the latter date I was ignorant that
 it possessed true metallic properties.
     I trust the improbability, nay, the impossibility of this being
the case, will be recognized by every chemist who has examined
 thallium. It is an element as easily reduced to and preserved
 in a metallic state as lead: can it, then, be imagined that I,
 who was so much interested in determining its characters—who
 had been for twelve months leaving no means untried to obtain
 a more copious source of thallium—who during that time had
 scarcely for a day relaxed Working on this subject exclusively—
is it likely, I say, that I should have been such an egregious
blunderer as not to <U+FB01>nd out that it was a metal? Why, as
soon as I had obtained a dozen grains of one of its com
pounds fairly pure, I could scarcely try the simplest experiment
without having the fact of its metallic character forced upon
me in too positive a manner to admit of doubt. Consistent
 with this probability that I considered thallium to be a metal,
is the fact that it was exhibited as being a metal.
    Having thus stated the grounds on which I claim the dis
whei-e it presented a coherent metallic appearance, of dark colour, but
which, when freshly scraped with a knife, gave a coloured metal similar to
lead. You also had a larger quantity precipitating on platinum in the
s ongy form, which, compressed, gave metallic lustre, and when tried in
t e spectroscope, gave the green line magni<U+FB01>cently.

         VIII. Note on the Tides and the Earth’s Rotation.
                      By THOMAS CARRICK, Esq.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
THE speculations of Dr. J. R. Mayer on the effect produced
         by the tides on the earth’s rotation, which appear in his
‘Essay on Celestial Dynamics,’ reprinted in your Journal for
May 1863, are based upon the assumption that the tidal wave
always lies to the east of the moon’s meridian, and has a slow
progressive motion from west to east, opposite in direction‘ to
the rotation of the earth 5 an assumption which cannot, I believe,
be justi<U+FB01>ed consistently with the known facts of tidal motion in
any sense which warrants the conclusions sought to be indorsed
thereon.
   As Prof. Tyndall in his “Remarks on the Dynamical Theory
of Heat,” published in the same Number of your Journal, has
indorsed Dr. Mayer’s views, and as the subject appears likely
to undergo further discussion, it seems desirable to call atten
tion to the untenable nature of the assumption.
   Our knowledge of the position and progress of tidal waves
is derived from observations of the time of high water on ocean
coasts, the direction in which the hours increase along a given
coast being held to indicate the direction of the progressive

64     Mr. T. Carrick on the Tides and the Earth's Rotation.
motion of the wave. The hypothesis of a wave always following
in the rear of the moon’s motion, as assumed by Dr. Mayer,
obtains little con<U+FB01>rmation from these recorded observations,
which, indeed, at <U+FB01>rst sight would seem rather to indicate a pro
gression nearly everywhere at right angles to the direction of the
motion of the moon.
   To this anomalous progression we owe the hypothesis of free
ocean waves of translation, whose progress is illustrated by maps
of cotidal lines. This hypothesis, however, has been pronounced
untenable by its ablest expounder.
   Guided by speculation in cosmical dynamics, the nature of
which need not here be alluded to, I have arrived at the conclu
sion that tidal phenomena ought to be grouped in relation to
land areas as causal centres.
   In a paper read before the Physical and Mathematical Section
of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester on the
30th of April last *, I discussed from this point of view the hours
of high water at full and change for the principal places on the
globe as given in the Tide Tables for 1863 published by the
Admiralty (these hours being <U+FB01>rst reduced to Greenwich mean
time), and thereby arrived at the following law of the progres
 sion of the wave of high Water :—
    “ In all land areas in the northern hemisphere the wave of high
water tends to revolve round the coast in the direction of the hands
of a watch, and in like areas in the southern hemisphere against the
hands of a watch.”
    The term wave is not here used in the sense of a free wave of
translation. Theoretically, this law ought to hold good in pro
portion as land areas approximate to the circular form, with wide
uninterrupted ocean spaces all round.
    The complicated nature of the data of tidal hours has always
constituted a serious obstacle in the way of any causal theory ;
but the above recited law, even if considered as a mere empirical
 grouping of the facts, comprehends in harmonious relation a
 much greater range of these facts than any hypothesis hitherto
 propounded.
    Such being the case, it is obvious that the waves of different
 hemispheres and of opposite shores will tend to neutralize each
 other, without leaving even a residual casting in the tidal wave
 from which any action on the rotation of the earth can be clearly
 inferred.

 IX. Remarks on Professor Tait’s last Letter to Sir David Brewster.
                 By Joan TYNDALL, F.R.S., §'c.>l<
 THE scienti<U+FB01>c public has already formed its own estimate of
        the charge made against me in the October Number of
 ‘Good Words,’ and it is therefore not necessary that I should
 refer to it further. But in the last paragraph of Prof. Tait’s
 last communication to the Philosophical Magazine a new point
 is raised against me, which I now beg permission to examine.
    In the article which generated this discussion Profs. Thomson
 and Tait write as follows :—-“ In 1843 he (Mr. Joule) published
the results of a well-planned and executed series of experiments,
by which he ascertained that a pound of water is raised 1° Fahr.
in temperature by 772 foot-pounds of mechanical work done upon
it.” And in reference to this passage, I state that “ it was in
1849, and not in 1843, that Mr. Joule proved the mechanical
equivalent of heat to be 772 foot-pounds. His determinations
in 1843 varied from 1040 to 587' foot-pounds.” To men of
science throughout the world I leave it to decide whether this
statement is not strictly true. VVhat, then, is the “remark
able exception” referred to by Prof. Tait? If the reader have
patience to follow me he shall learn. In an appendix which fol
lows my letter to Prof. Thomson, I quote from my book on Heat a
résume’ of the results obtained by Mr. Joule in 1843. Mr. Joule
describes each series of his experiments, gives the numbers
obtained, and deduces from these numbers the mechanical
equivalent of heat, which he places in each case at the end of a
paragraph. When I wrote my book I went carefully over
Mr. Joule’s paper,—<U+FB01>rst looking at his numerical data, and then
taking up his result. This paper was dated from “ Pendlebury,
near Manchester, July 1843.”
    A postscript followed the paper, commencing with words
 which indicated a reference to the results previously recorded.
 I cast my eye over the postscript; I saw no numerical data,
 and no mechanical equivalent at the end of any one of its three
 paragraphs, and hence I concluded that the results ended with
 the paper itself. Prof. Tait, however, has discovered that in
 the middle of the <U+FB01>rst paragraph of the postscript a determination
 is alluded to. Here is Mr. Joule’s whole statement regarding
 it :—“ I have myself proved that heat is evolved by the passage of
 water through narrow tubes. My apparatus consisted of a piston,
 perforated by a number of holes, working in a cylinder glass jar,
  and containing about 7 lbs. of water. I thus obtained one
  degree of heat per pound of water from a mechanical force
  capable of raising about 770 lbs. one foot high.”    This, then, is
                     * Communicated by the Author.

66       Prof. Tyndall on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.
the “remarkable exception” of Prof. Tait. Had it caught my
eye, of course it would have been gathered up as the others, but
it would no more have affected my statement that the deter
minations of 184.3 varied from 1040 to 587 foot-pounds, than
 the number 742 actually contained in my Table.
    But have I really omitted to give Mr. Joule due credit
for this experiment? Assuredly not. I was well acquainted
with it, though when collecting the results for my book I
overlooked it. In my morning lectures I referred to it thus :—
“ He (Mr. Joule) also urged water through capillary tubes, and
determined the amount of heat generated by the friction of the
water against the sides of the tubes; and the results of all his
experiments leave no shadow of doubt upon the mind, that, under
all circumstances, the quantity of heat generated by the same
amount of force is <U+FB01>xed and invariable.” I have publicly
repeated this statement in print three times, to Prof. Tait’s own
knowledge, since it was <U+FB01>rst uttered.
   And now I would ask my assailants, as men of honour,
whether they had this experiment in their minds when they
wrote the passage commented on? If so, by what right do they
call this isolated result, stuck into the middle of a paragraph,
without data, and without a word to indicate the precautions
employed, “ a well-planned and executed_series of experiments ?”
Why, moreover, did they displace the number 770 by the exact
equivalent 772? When I think of the men who will read this
last paragraph of Prof. Tait and pass judgment on it, I am
restrained from making any further effort to disentangle it; nor
shall I deem it necessary to answer any further remarks of this
kind.
   One word in conclusion. For reasons far too long to be here
stated, I regarded Prof. William Thomson as my real assailant
in ‘Good Words,’ and wishing to show my readiness to settle
our differences in an open manly way, I addressed him to the
exclusion of Prof. Tait. To cast a slight upon Prof. Tait was
not necessary to my defence ; and as far as the <U+FB01>rst paragragh
of my letter to Prof. Thomson appears to convey such a slight, I
should wish it unwritten. For his sake, and not for mine, I
could wish the same with regard to the last paragraph of
Prof. Tait’s last communication.
   Royal Institution, June 23, 1863.
   I had the happiness of receiving a few days ago a letter from
Dr. Mayer—-the <U+FB01>rst which has ever passed between us—an
extract from which will interest many of the readers of the
Philosophical Magazine :—

    of last June Prof. Clausius conveyed to me the pleasant intelli

    in stillness I ventured to cherish were exceeded by the recognition
    which you there accorded me, and I am still more deeply
    affected by the receipt of your last communication to the
    Philosophical Magazine. Your kindness makes all the deeper
    impression from the fact that for many years I have been forced
    to habituate myself to a precisely opposite mode of treatment.

near Leeds, on the 7th of May, 1862.”      By Thomas Sutcliife, Esq.,
in a letter to Dr. Sharpey, Sec. R.S.
                                            I-leadingley, July 16th, 1862.
   DEAR S1n,—Allow me to offer you some memoranda, which I
made at Headingley, near Leeds, on the 7th of May last, respecting
a hailstorm which visited several parts of England on that day. It
appears that it arrived at Newark about 5 o’clock P.M., and was
succeeded by a tornado which did much damage; then, pursuing a
N.N.Westerly direction it reached Wake<U+FB01>eld at 6.41. The hail
continued to fall till about 6.58. The afternoon at Headingley had
been remarkably hot and close, and the atmosphere densely charged
with vapour; at 6.45 the sky had become so overspread with dark
clouds that it was impossible to see anything within doors without
arti<U+FB01>cial light. There were several peals of thunder and repeated
<U+FB02>ashes of rose-coloured lightning. The storm visited the villages on
the west of Leeds with especial violence, the hailstones knocking
down several people, and breaking nearly all glass exposed to the
W.S.W.
   The hailstones did not fall in a continuous shower, but in irregular
clusters; sometimes a <U+FB01>eld would be thickly strewed with them,
whilst an adjoining one escaped with scarcely any; one part of a
greenhouse would be much '_broken, and the remainder, similarly
exposed, escape uninjured. The district over which hail fell was very
narrow.
    To illustrate the force of,the falling stones, I may mention that
circular holes were cut in glass without the sheet being otherwise
injured. I have the end of a pendulous branch of beech, 12 inches
long and -gths of an inch in circumference, which was cut from the
tree, also several larger branches from apple and lilactrees, which
appeared to have been split from the adjoining boughs. Some muslin
curtains spread on the grass to dry were torn by the hail with
numerous crucial rents.
   The hailstones were of di<U+FB01>'erent forms and sizes. I sketched about
forty varieties; but as many bear a certain resemblance to each other,
I select four of them for illustration. These were taken out of deep
grass nearly half an hour after they had fallen. Figures 1 to 4
represent them of the size and shape they had when I picked them
up. The heaviest I weighed was only 2 ozs., but other persons
assert that they weighed some upwards of 5 ozs. each. No. 1 had a
creamy white colour, with linear markings from the centre outwards;
this variety appeared to constitute the nucleus of most of the larger
ones, around which transparent ice had accumulated in rounded con
tinuous masses. From the outside of some of the masses protruded
icicles; the remains of two may be seen attached to the side of
No. 2. When the stones <U+FB01>rst fell, some of these icicles were 1% and
2 inches long, and grotesquely shaped.        It has been asserted that
all the hailstones had the white nucleus, but this was not the case
in our neighbourhood; 35 per cent. of those I gathered were without
it, and assumed something of the shape of No. 3, which seemed an
aggregate of crystals of clear ice. I found one which was composed

of <U+FB01>ve large masses of ice, quite clear, and in size like <U+FB01>ve nutmegs.
There were some which did not correspond with _any of the above
descriptions; thus No. 4 has the round white radiated mass on the
outside of the clear ice.

    “ On the true Theory of Pressure as applied to Elastic Fluids.” By
R. Moon, M.A.             Received June 26, 1862.
    It is the author’s object
    I. To show that, in elastic <U+FB02>uids in motion, or tending to move, it
is not generally true, or at least not accurately true, that the pres
sure depends solely on the density, as is assumed in the ordinary
theory of the motion of elastic <U+FB02>uids.
    II. To show that, within certain limits and under certain circum
stances, pressure may be transmitted instantaneously from one point
of an elastic <U+FB02>uid to other points situated at <U+FB01>nite distances from the
<U+FB01>rst, before any change has been effected in the density of the inter
mediate <U+FB02>uid»-in a manner analogous to that in which, in the theory of
dynamics as applied to rigid bodies, force is assumed to be propagated
instantaneously from one point to another.
    III. To show that in elastic <U+FB02>uids in motion, or tending to move,
the pressure at any point in a given direction will consist of two
parts :—one depending solely on the density, which will be equal in
all directions; the other depending on the state of motion throughout
the <U+FB02>uid generally, and which will vary with the direction in which
the pressure is estimated. The former of these two constituents the
author proposes to designate the statical pressure; the latter, the
instantaneous pressure.            The true pressure at any point in a given di
rection will be found by taking the sum or di<U+FB01>erence of the statical and
instantaneous pressures, according to circumstances.

   On the true Theory of Pressure as applied to Elastic Fluids.                  71
     IV. To indicate the manner in which the instan
  taneous pressure may be represented mathematically.
     V. To show the bearing of the proposed correc
  tion on the received theory of sound.                         D—__.C
     ABC D is a vertical cylinder closed at the base
  AB, and having an air-tight piston C D capable
  of moving freely in the upper part of it.
     Below the piston the tube is <U+FB01>lled with air, which
  at the time t is wholly free from impressed velocity,
  but in which the density varies in the following
  manner: viz., from AB up to an imaginary hori
 zontal plane E F, the density is uniform ; while E —— F
 from E F the density gradually increases up to C D,
 in such a manner that the effective force at every
 point of the air between E F and C D is exactly the
 same, and equal to f *. Above the piston a vacuum
 exists. The piston is supposed to have weight,
 but, for the sake of simplicity, the air under the
 piston is supposed to be unaffected by gravity.
 The weight of the piston is supposed to be such
 that the effective force on each particle of the
 piston is the same as that on each particle of the
 mass of<U+FB02>uid E C, viz'._f.                                      1\————B
    If the pressure exerted by the air which originally occupied the
 space A F on that which originally occupied the space E C were to
 continue during the time t1 the same that it was at the time t, every
 particle of the former mass of air (which we will designate as the air
in AF) would during the time t, be under the action of the same
effective force j, and would therefore in that time describe the same
                             2
length of path, viz»/-EL ; and on this supposition no change would
take place in the density of the air in E C during the time t,.                But,
according to the received theory, the pressure of the air in A F on
that in E C will continue unchanged until the density of the part of
the air in AB which abuts on the common boundary of the two
masses of <U+FB02>uid has changed. Hence change in the density of the
air in A F must precede change in the density of E C.
    On the other hand, so long as the pressure of the air in E C on
the air in AF remains unchanged, the air in A F will remain at rest,
and will therefore undergo no change of density. But as, according
to the received theory, the pressure of the air in E C on the air in
AF depends on the density of the part of the air in E C which abuts
on the common boundary of the two masses of air, it follows that
change in the density of the air in E C must precede change in the
density of the air in AF.                                                         _
    But we have before proved the exact contrary, viz. that change in
the density of the air in A F must precede change in the density of
   * This will be the case if % Z~€=_f, or putting p=a’p, 02 log,p =fl'+v; Wllem
p denotes the density at the distance .r measured vertically, and c is 21 const.

72                          Royal Society.
the air in E C.   It is evident therefore that, according to the received
theory, no change can, under the circumstances above supposed, take
place in the density of either mass of air.
   If, however, the density in A F remain unchanged, we have already
seen that every particle in EC will in the time t1 describe a space
equal to-f%‘-2; and if the density in E C remain unchanged, we have
equally seen that every particle of AF will have remained at rest
during tl; which is a contradiction. It ap ears therefore that in
the case we have been considering the receive theory
leads us to an absurd result.
    It can with still more facility be shown that the I’
received theory leads to an absurd result in the fol
lowing case.
   A B C D is such a tube as before described; but in
the present case we shall suppose it <U+FB01>lled below the
piston with air of uniform density in equilibrium,
the pressure of the air being such as to exactly sus
tain the weight W1 of the piston. As before, a
vacuum is supposed to exist above the piston, and the
air is assumed to be unaffected by gravity.
    If a second weight W, be placed upon the piston,
we know that the equilibrium will be destroyed.
But if it be true, as the received theory asserts, that
the pressure of an elastic <U+FB02>uid depends solely on its
 density, the pressure of the air on the lower surface A               B
 of the piston will be exactly the same after W2 has
been introduced as it was before W2 was introduced; and, since
action and reaction are equal and opposite, whatever be the pressure
of the air in the piston, the same will be the pressure of the piston
on the air; so that the pressure downwards of the piston on the air
beneath will be the same after W2 was introduced as it was before ;
and the system therefore will continue in equilibrium after W2 has
been introduced; which is absurd.
   By an argument too elaborate to be indicated within the limits of
this abstract, the cause of the failure of the existing theory in the
instance <U+FB01>rst above considered is shown; and it is proved that in the
second case the effect of the introduction of the weight W, is instan
taneously to propagate through the air to a de<U+FB01>nite distance below
the piston a <U+FB01>nite increase of pressure; such increase of pressure
having its maximum immediately underneath the piston, and thence
gradually diminishing till, if the tube be long enough, it <U+FB01>nally
vanishes. The depth to which the instantaneous increase of pressure
will extend will be de<U+FB01>ned by means of two considerations :—lst, that
the effective force on every particle of the piston and weight must be
exactly the same as that on the air immediately below it ; and 2nd,
that the aggregate moving force developed in the piston W, the
weight W2, and the portion of the air in the tube through which the
‘instantaneous pressure extends, must be equal to the moving force
developed by gravity in W2 when free to move in vacuo.

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              73
     It is also shown that if instead of the weight on the piston being
 suddenly increased it were to be suddenly diminished, exactly analo
 gous results, mutatis mutandie, would occur,—the e<U+FB01>ect of the sudden
 removal of part of the weight being instantaneously to diminish the
 pressure to a <U+FB01>nite distance below the piston—such diminution having
 its maximum immediately beneath the piston, and thence radually
 diminishing till, at a certain distance below the piston, t e whole
 pressure will be exactly the same as it was before any part of the
 weight was removed.
    If the piston were wholly removed, the pressure of the air originally
in contact with it at the instant of removal would be zero.
    It is then shown that the addition to or diminution from the weight
on the piston in the case last considered will produce no immediate
 change in the horizontal pressure in the air below the piston.
    It is next shown that in cases where there is no impressed velocity,
 as in the case <U+FB01>rst considered in this paper, the instantaneous pres
sure pi may be expressed in terms of its partial differential coe<U+FB01>icients,
and of the density at the point where the pressure is being considered.
    It is also shown that, in the general case, where the whole or a
portion of the <U+FB02>uid is endued with velocity, the instantaneous pressure
 may be ascertained by adding to the expression of the last paragraph
a term involving the density and the partial differential coefficients
of the velocity at the point where the pressure is being considered.
    It is <U+FB01>nally shown that, in the case of the transmission of a pulse
through a cylindrical tube where the motions are small, the equation

the axis of a given stratum in the state of rest, 3/ the same distance
at the time t, and a’ and 6’ are constants, the value of a’ being the
same as in the ordinary theory.
    As this equation leads to the conclusion that there are two veloci
ties, it results that, except perhaps in very rare instances, in which a
duplication has been observed in sounds heard at very great distances,
the proposed correction of the theory of the motion of elastic <U+FB02>uids
will not practically affect the theory of sound.
   By the method adopted in the case of elastic <U+FB02>uids, the author
conceives himself to have established that, in what are commonly
termed inelastic <U+FB02>uids, the pressure during motion will not be equal
in all directions.

 remembrance by the few who survive to cherish his me
 mol\r’I3i'.. Taylor early evinced a strong turn (perhaps it is not
too much to say genius) for mechanical pursuits.
     In the <U+FB02>at and agricultural county of Norfolk there was
little to suggest projects for the engineer. The nearest ap
proach to an employment suited to a young man of such a
 turn seemed to be that of land-surveying, to which John
Taylor was accordingly brought up. But at the early age of
nineteen he was invited by some of the shareholders (or, as
they are called in Cornwall, adventurers) in Wheal Friendship
Mine to undertake the management of that important con
cern. The friends who thus sought to commit their interests
to his care were perfectly aware of his inexperience in all that
regarded mining. But they wanted a man of talents and in
dustry upon whose honour and integrity they could implicitly
rely, and they believed that the principles in which he had
been trained afforded a guarantee for their choice.
     It had been the practice for the agents to supply the neces
sary articles of consumption in the mines, such as timber,
candles, &c.,—a practice which necessarily led to great abuse.
Mr. Taylor immediately introduced the system of open con
tract, which has continued in operation ever since.
     As early as 1800 we <U+FB01>nd in the Philosophical Magazine an
 article by him on the history of mining in Devon and Comwal].
 In following years contributions appeared in that and other
journals on mining-machinery, on the ventilation of mines*,
on the economy of mines, on smelting, and on kindred subj ccts.
These papers embodied the results of his practical experiencef.
    Among the proofs of his constant and earnest desire to ele
vate the art of mining and to found it on a scienti<U+FB01>c basis, we
may mention that, in 1829, he undertook the editorship, and,
to a considerable extent, the cost, of a work which he hoped
would conduce to the end he had so much at heart, entitled
“Records of Mining.” The volume, or part, contains four
papers from his own pen, the <U+FB01>rst of which is a “ Prospectus of
a School of Mines in Cornwall” 1. “ If,” says he, in this excel
lent and well-digested paper, “ what has become the theme of
praise in other parts of Europe be not applicable to England,
it must be either because our mines do not require intelligence
and skill for their management, or that our miners are not

most obvious means for doing so.
   “ As to the <U+FB01>rst, it is well known that one effect of late efforts
in mining in England has been to deepen the mines with a
rapidity totally unprecedented, to consolidate smaller concerns
into larger ones, to explore more perfectly the ground in all
 directions, to adapt means that might render labour produc
 tive of pro<U+FB01>t, to stimulate the labourer by combining his in
 terest with that of his employer, to watch every symptom with
 care, and to employ every device that ingenuity could suggest to
 overcome di<U+FB01>iculties. It must then obviously follow that there
 is a. greater demand for skill in the conduct of these a<U+FB01>airs, as
 the mines are increasing in depth and extent; numerous ex
 pedients to counterbalance these di<U+FB02>iculties are required ; and
 as the expenses increase, compensation must be looked for in
 the aids that science may afford.”
    In the foregoing description of the progress made in the art
 of mining, Mr. Taylor does in fact trace the history of his own
 labours. Those who are conversant with what has been done
 since the beginning of the century, know how much of it may
 be ascribed to him.
    The prospectus affords ample evidence not only of his zeal
 in the cause he advocates, but of the remarkable talent for
 organization and administration which from the <U+FB01>rst had dis
 tinguished his practical career. After pointing out the need
for a. school of mines, Mr. Taylor proceeds to what he calls the
 detail, which he arranges under the following heads :—
    “ 1. The things most proper to be taught.
    “ 2. The class ofpersons who may be expected to be scholars.
    “ 3. The professors.
    “ 4-. The situation of a school of mines.
    “ 5. The probable expense of the institution.
     “ 6. The means of providing the necessary funds.
     “ 7. The government or direction.”
     Each of these heads is treated specially, and shows not only
 perfect acquaintance with the whole matter to be considered,
 but perfect judgment and good sense. Nothing is proposed to
 be done or learned in order to give an air of scienti<U+FB01>c depth to
 the studies; no curious but inapplicable research, or ambitious
 <U+FB02>ights into purely speculative regions are attempted; the end
 is kept steadily in view, and the road to it distinctly marked out.
     This plan, excellent as it was, met with no encouragement
 at the time. It was, however, adopted some years after.
 The School of Mines which now exists, though he had no
 active share in its establishment, may be traced to Mr. Tay
 101"s earnest representations.

     Owing to circumstances upon which it is needless here to
 dilate, he quitted Tavistock in the year 1812 and came to
 settle in London. On his removal he, together with his
 brother Mr. Philip Taylor, engaged in a chemical manu
 factory at Stratford in Essex. The science of chemistry, which
 had always been a favourite pursuit with him, now became
 his profession. He was indefatigable in his private labora
 tory as well as in the manufactory. And he was in communica
 tion with the greatest chemists of the day, both English and
 foreign. We have the highest authority for affirming that, up
 to a certain period, he was regarded by them as one of the <U+FB01>rst
 metallurgical chemists of this country*.
    Mr. Taylor’s ardour in chemical discovery was stimu
 lated and encouraged by daily intercourse with his brother.
 1n COI1J11I1Ctl0I1 with him, he made a series of experiments
 upon the gas obtained from oil, with a view to test its illumi
 nating quality, and apply it to economical uses. These experi
 ments led to the invention of an apparatus for making and
 distributing oil-gas. That pure and brilliant gas was intro
 duced into some towns and public buildings, especially Covent
 Garden Theatre, and the Imperial Palace at St. Petersburg. Its
 greater costliness, however, prevented its general adoption.
    But the increasing extent and importance of his mining
 business compelled him to withdraw from all other pursuits,
 and give himself up exclusively to the management of mines.
 Those which he directed from 1799 to 1812 were, as we have
 said, on the borders of Devonshire and Cornwall. To these were
 now added the Consolidated Mines, and others in the latter
 county.
    About the year 1820 he was requested to take the manage
ment of the mineral property of the Duke of Devonshire in
 Staffordshire, Yorkshire, and Ireland; in 1822 he undertook
the direction of Lord Grosvenor’ s mines in Wales, of the Mold
mines in the same country; and in 1823, of those in Cum
berland belonging to Greenwich Hospital.
    Mr. Taylor was a member of many scienti<U+FB01>c and learned
societies, British and foreign. In 1825 he was elected a
 Fellow of the Royal Society. He was one of the earliest
 Fellows of the Geological Society, and in 1816 was appointed
its Treasurer, an office which he retained till 1844.
    Mr. Taylor was one of the earliest and most active members
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science_
The <U+FB01>rst meeting of the <U+FB01>rst Council of that body was held at
his house in Bedford Row, on the 26th of June 1832.
   * In 1823 he delivered a course of lectures on metallurgy at the London
Institution.

    Mr. Taylor was then requested to undertake the o<U+FB01>ice of
 Treasurer, which he held till Sept. 1861, when a letter was
 read from his two sons, requesting, on the part of their aged
 father, that he might be relieved from the o<U+FB01>ice he had held
 so long. This elicited a warm and unanimous expression of
 respect for his character, and gratitude for his long and
 valuable services to the cause of science.
    Mr. Taylor was also Treasurer of the London University
 College for many years; a member of the Club of Social
 Chemists, which then (about the year 1820) numbered among
 Its members Mr. Brande, Mr. Bingley (Master ofthe Mint), Dr.
 Fitton, Dr. Paris, Mr. Richard Phillips, Mr. Haseldine Pepys,
 John George Children, BartoValle, and other eminent chemists;
 and also of the Smeatonian Club, to which the Rennies and
 other eminent engineers belonged. The profession of Mining
Engineer was elevated by him, and the domain of mechanics
 extended and enriched by the knowledge and application of
 Geology, Mineralogy, Chemistry, and Metallurgy.
    He wrote little, for he had other and more enduring ways
of employing his peculiar talents, and he wrote only when
he had something to say which he wanted to make known.
His work, although always guided and enlightened by
science, was mainly practical, and consisted rather in the
application of scienti<U+FB01>c principles to methods, processes, and
machinery than in the discovery of the principles them
selves. His writings have never been collected. Indeed he
seems to have attached little importance to them; and the
very existence of some was unknown to his family,—for in.
stance the excellent introduction to Risden’s ‘ Survey of Devon,’
ed. 1811. This full and able paper treats of the soil, agri
culture, manufactures, means of defence, and (more especially)
mineral products of the county. The only part relating to
himself and his own works is the description of the canal
which he cut from Tavistock to the river Tamar. Of this
work, including a long and dif<U+FB01>cult tunnel, he was the sole
engineer; and he had to encounter obstacles which at that
early period the experience of others had scarcely taught the
way to surmount. In this enterprise, and in all the more
di<U+FB02>icult operations in which he was engaged, he had to a
considerable extent to invent his own methods.
   For a long time before his death his memory had been
failing, and disease had gradually impaired the higher faculties
of his mind. But, even amidst the decay of his intellectual
powers, the kindness of his heart, and the instinctive politeness
which struck and charmed all who approached him, did not
 desert him. The gleams of his benevolent consideration for

others, which broke forth out of the mental twilight in which
he sat, were inexpressibly affecting. He passed away peace
fully to the enjoyment of that light which shall know no
cloud nor dimness.

numerous descendants in the second generation.

    ON THE WAVE 01" HIGH WATER, WITH HINTS TOWARDS A NEW
           THEORY 0]!‘ THE TIDES.      BY THOMAS CARRICK, ESQ.
      The author, starting from a. new hypothesis on the relations of
   terrestrial matter to cosmical force, has arrived at the conclusion
   that the tidal motions of ocean surfaces are caused by a differential
   action of force centring on land areas. The nature of this hypo
   thesis, and its relation to those motions, were brie<U+FB02>y illustrated from
   the point of view of an assumed nebulous origin of the solar system.
   The author nevertheless declined to endorse the received “ nebular
  hypothesis ” as a genetic theory, and adopted its ideas and phraseo
  logy in his paper solely from considerations of brevity in this inci
  dental portion of his subject.
     Assuming the existence of a diffused nebula, composed of ultimate
  atoms of matter each having a. normal rotation on a <U+FB01>xed axis in
  a uniform direction,_ and with simple forces of attraction and repul
  sion arising thereout, then, from causes arising out of diverse
  molecular groupings of these atoms and their poles, the nebulous
  matter in condensing upon a centre might take up three successive
  states, constituting the normal types of the solid, liquid, and gaseous
  states of terrestrial science,—the solid matter forming a spherical
  nucleus, everywhere covered with a concentric layer of <U+FB02>uid, and
 this overlaid with a gaseous envelope; these varying layers of matter
 being in stable equilibrium at the respective surfaces of contact.
 The force exerted upon such a sphere by another of like origin would
 therefore act by and through the intermediation of these three states,
 —each successive stage of condensation, alike with a residual uncon
 densed nebulous matter of space, thus forming an essential link in
 the chain of gravitative action.      But so soon as any portions of the
 solid nucleus emerge above the surface of the <U+FB02>uid covering, into
 abnormal contact with the gaseous envelope, a. differential action of
 enormous magnitude, centring upon these upheaved land areas, would
be at once originated, the <U+FB01>rst measure of which would be the
cosmicai value of the latent forces by which the <U+FB02>uid state of matter
was constituted an essential intermediate link between the solid
and gaseous states. In the view of the author, terrestrial matter in
all its phases is now related to space, and to bodies in space, in a
manner analogous to that which might have resulted from such a
hypothetical origin. Not only does this matter exist in the three
leading states of earth, water, and air, but each of the simpler forms
of inorganic matter can, under given conditions, successively assume
the solid, liquid, or gaseous state without undergoing any chemical
change. This universal threefold relation of terrestrial matter points
strongly towards the simple hypothesis, that the causal laws which
now regulate these interchanges of state are the re<U+FB02>ex of fundamental
laws underlying the entire constitution of matter in the solar system.
    Passing over the possible relation of the <U+FB01>rst land-upheaval to the
early changes recorded by geology, and to the formation of hetero
geneous solids, liquids, and gases, the di<U+FB02>"erential force arising there
from would be the initiating cause in the formation of the envelope
of comminuted water or vapour which now encircles the whole globe.

80             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
This vapour-ocean constitutes an intermediate state of matter in un
stable equilibrium with other states at all surfaces of contact. By
interactions arising thereout, the simple static conditions of force
existing prior to land-upheaval are now, in the view of the author,
partly replaced by more complex phases of force ; and thus light, heat,
electricity, and magnetism, which are expressions of these complex
phases, have their root in local reactions between unstable states of
terrestrial matter at surfaces of abnormal contact when under the
tension of cosmical force—just as all these “imponderable elements”
are evoked in the voltaic battery by surface reactions of dissimilar
solids and liquids in presence of atmospheric tension. In short, the
ceaseless molecular changes and local motions of terrestrial matter
Would, on this hypothesis, be mainly referred to the di<U+FB01>erential
action arising out of land-upheaval.
   Recurring to the “ wave of high water " which formed the special
subject of the paper, another phase of the present residual of that
differential action would give rise to the tidal motions of ocean sur
faces, the perturbative action centring on land areas, and attaining
a maximum value on the shores of those areas. By discussing the
hours of high water at full and change for the principal places of the
globe, given in the Admiralty Tide Tables for 1863 (the data being
<U+FB01>rst reduced to Greenwich mean time), the author arrived at the
following law of the progression of the wave of high water :—
   In all land areas in the northern hemisphere the wave of high water
tends to revolve round the coast in the direction of the hands of a watch,
and in like areas in the southern hemisphere against the hands of a
watch.
   Theoretically, this law should hold good in proportion as land
areas approximate to the circular form, with wide uninterrupted
ocean spaces all round.    In a perfectly circular area of this kind, the
di<U+FB01>erential action would have points of maximum and minimum effect
on opposite shores at every instant,-—these together forming a nodal
line, both ends of which would move simultaneously round the coast
as the moon passed across the heavens, the wave of high water being
everywhere the instantaneous expression of the differential force at
its nodal point of maximum action.
   By enclosing the continents and land areas which approach near
est to the prescribed conditions within one or more circles intersecting
the salient parts of the coast, the author showed that whenever any
systematic progression of the hour of high water could be distinctly
traced, that progression is almost invariably in the required direction.
Owing, however, to the irregular shape of all existing land areas,’ tq
the impossibility of including some of these in a single circle approxi
mating to the coast line, and to the way in which some large area$
are massed upon others with little or no intervening ocean spaces,
many instances of anomalous results are found; and yet, when
rightly considered in relation to disturbing causes, even these tend
indirectly to con<U+FB01>rm the method of grouping the data of tidal hours
in relation to land areas as causal centres.—Proceedings of the Man

           XII. On the Theory of Light. By L. LORENZ *.
       F we consider all the hypotheses belonging to our present
         theory of light, that is to say, all those that are regarded as
  necessary for the explanation of the double refraction, chromatic
  dispersion, and polarization of light, it is di<U+FB01>icult to guard our
  selves from all doubt of so complex a theoretical apparatus,
  seeing that the probability of its truth .must rapidly diminish as
 the number of hypotheses involved in it increases, notwithstand
 ing that we may be convinced of the probability of each hypo
thesis taken by itself.
     I have therefore tried to develope the theory of light with the
smallest possible number of hypothetical assumptions, whether
in regard to the nature of light itself, to that of the luminiferous
medium, or to that of material bodies; and it will appear, as the
result of the present investigation, that an essential part of the
ordinaryfphysical hypotheses are not needed for the explanation of
the phenomena of light, inasmuch as the theory is capable of
being carried through in a manner different from that which has
been hitherto followed in the investigation of this subject, and
consisting in the further development of the formal side of the
theory.

  of the same kind, are known, it is evidently possible to generalize

 the calculation so far that it shall also give the laws of the motion
 of light in heterogeneous media, since this motion must arise as
 the resultant effect of the rays that are transmitted and those
 that are re<U+FB02>ected to in<U+FB01>nity. I have in fact worked out the cal
 culation for the comparatively simple case in which the medium is
 made up ofvery thin parallel layers; and the result shows that such
 a medium not only disperses light, but doubly refracts it, like an
 optically uniaxial crystal whose optic axis is perpendicular to the
 layers. Nevertheless, although the possibility of solving the
 problem in a more general form, and without any further phy
 sical assumptions, is already apparent, an imperfection is inhe
 rent in the method itself which led me on to insurmountable
 di<U+FB02><U+FB01>culties as soon as I attempted the case of a medium com
 posed of two systems of parallel layers making an angle with
 each other. It then becomes necessary to have recourse to the
 more perfect mathematical methods, and to express the laws of
 the motion in heterogeneous media by means of partial differ
 ential equations, and to deduce thence, by subsequent integra
tion, the path of the rays of light.
    It is then also further needful to de<U+FB01>ne our hypotheses with
 greater precision, and especially to introduce the conception of
 the plane of vibration instead of that of the plane of polarization.
 The motion must be determined in relation to magnitude and
 direction by the amplitude and direction of the vibrations; but
 although these expressions are borrowed from our common mode
 of considering the vibrations of elastic bodies, it is not intended
to attach to them here any such absolute meaning; thus, for
instance, the vibrations may be conceived of as rotatory, in which
case the “ direction of vibration ” would be the direction of “ the
 axes of rotation,” and the “amplitude of vibration” would be
the angular distance of the molecules from their position of
equilibrium.
   I must at once insist upon this double point of view, because the
 following calculation renders no further determination of these
 primary physical hypotheses necessary; and inasmuch as I shall
not have another opportunity of returning in this memoir to this
physical side of the theory of light, I may be allowed to point
out at once that, so far from this latter mode of conceiving the
vibrations being a mere mathematical speculation, the results of
the present investigation appear to indicate it as probably the
true foundation for the physical theory of light.
    Retaining, then, the latitude of interpretation that has been
indicated, the following are our assumptions :-—
    1. The “ amplitude of vibration ” and the “ direction of vibra,_
tion” give us three components f, 07, § in the direction of the
three rectangular axes of coordinates for determining the motion

     these vibrations is expressed, for isotropic homogeneous media,
     by the following partial differential equations :—

        Hence in such a medium, supposing it to be unlimited, th

     3. The plane drawn through the direction of vibration and
 through the direction of the ray is perpendicular to the plane of
polarization of the ray. This assumption can scarcely a<U+FB01>ect the
 results in relation to the propagation of light in heterogeneous
media, in so far as they come within the scope of our considera
 tion, since, as already mentioned, it is possible to conceive this
as deduced without any assumptions as to the position of the
direction of vibration relatively to the plane of polarization. I
consider it, nevertheless, as in any case proved by my experi
ments on the diffraction of light (Poggendorfs Annalen, vol. cxi.
p. 315) ; for, as I shall show in the sequel, the assumptions that
Zlre there made can be deduced from the equations (1) and (2)
   one.
    These three hypotheses, then, in conjunction with Fresnel’s
formula: for the refraction and re<U+FB02>exion of light at the limiting
Iurface of two isotropic transparent media, form the foundation
Of the present theory of light. There can, in fact, no longer be

any doubt that these formulae correspond exactly with experi
ment, and that the slight discrepancies which Jamin has detected
receive anatural explanation from the fact that the passage from
one body to another takes place gradually. (Cf. Poggend0r<U+FB01>"s
Annalen, vol. cxi. p. 460; also vol. cxiv. p. 244.)     These slight
discrepancies only serve as a further con<U+FB01>rmation of the exact
applicability of the formulm when the refractive index of the two
bodies undergoes a sudden or in<U+FB01>nitely small alteration ; of which
cases the latter only will be here taken as the basis of the calcu
lation. On the other hand, it is to be borne in mind that, although
these formulae are taken as the starting-point of the theory, they
are to be regarded as deduced solely from experiment, so that
equal weight must be given to any other formula: which lead to
equally concordant results.
    If we accordingly endeavour to give to the formula their most
 general and most fully developed form, it becomes evident, in the
<U+FB01>rst place, that we may add as a factor to the expression for the
amplitude of vibration of the refracted ray an arbitrarily chosen
power of the refractive index, since, in the refracting body, neither
the intensity nor the direction of polarization are determined by
 experiment, and, besides this, the factor in question will disap
pear again. Even if we could determine the intensity experi
 mentally in the refracting body, this facto'r would still be unde
 termined ; for we may consider it as experimentally demonstrated
 that in one and the same substance the intensity is proportional
 to the square of the amplitude of vibration ; but it is unknown
 what power of the index of refraction enters here as a factor.
 ‘We shall nevertheless immediately show that this factor is the
 same for vibrations taking place in the plane of incidence and
 for those perpendicular thereto, an assumption which is neces
 sary for the attainment of homogeneity in the following results.
 On this supposition, the factor in question has no in<U+FB02>uence on
 the rotation of the plane of polarization in the refracting body,
 and hence it cannot be determined by means of experiments on
 this rotation.
    Again, the sign of the excursion of the re<U+FB02>ected ray is to some
 extent undetermined. If the angle of incidence be denoted by
 a, and the angle of refraction by B, the ratio of the excursion of
the incident, refracted, and re<U+FB02>ected light will be, according tg
~l3‘resnel’s formula thus expanded, for vibrations in the plane of
incidence, as

     p is here the above-mentioned undetermined exponent, which
   in Fresnel’s expressions is equal to nothing. The second source
   of uncertainty is the double sign, which, however, it must be
   observed, is reversed in the two cases. The positive direction of
   vibrations which take place in the plane of incidence may, for
   instance, be chosen so that, the plane of incidence being supposed
   horizontal, it is to the lift of the observer when he is turned
  towards the ray, whether incident or re<U+FB02>ected. Now it is a fact
  that when light is re<U+FB02>ected at an angle of incidence of nearly
  90°, for example, the azimuth of the plane of vibration does not
  change its sign, calculated in the manner already indicated,
  whence it follows that EM and §i—I1(a—_B) are in this case

  occur only if the two expressions have opposite signs. _
     Nevertheless we use the formulae that have been glven only
 for the casein which the angle of incidence differs in<U+FB01>nitely little
 from the angle of refraction. If ,8=u+al¢, the ratios for the
  vibrations in the plane of incidence become as

     We will now, in the <U+FB01>rst place, suppose the heterogeneous
 body divided into layers in some given direction, in such wise
 that each layer perpendicular to the axis of .r may be regarded
as homogeneous for an in<U+FB01>nitely small thickness, and as differ
ing to an in<U+FB01>nitely small amount from the next following layer.
Within the limits of such a layer the ray moves as in a homo
geneous body; at the limiting surface it is partially re<U+FB02>ected;
and both in the incident and in the re<U+FB02>ected ray the vibrations are
perpendicular to the direction of the ray. We here take into con
sideration the elementary rays or the virtual motion of the light ;
the actual motion thence resulting may perhaps exhibit a differ
ent direction of vibration, since, for example, all the rays re<U+FB02>ected
from the different layers may neutralize each other, although they
may still exert an in<U+FB02>uence on the direction of the vibrations in
the transmitted ray.
    If we assume that the plane of coordinates we coincides with
the plane of incidence, the excursion at the entrance of the light
into the substance, at the urface .r=O, may be expressed by
terms of the form

    As the ray penetrates further into the substance, it undergoes
 continually a partial re<U+FB02>exion, while in the transmitted portion
 both A and the exponent vary. The expression for the excur
 sion in a layer which we may call ‘the layer (a), wherein the
 angle of incidence is 04, takes consequently the form

 where the ray enters the substance.
    For the ray re<U+FB02>ected at this same layer (a+d¢), p becomes

  ipsiguza when they are perpendicular thereto.         Let both these

     The two compound rays, re<U+FB02>ected and refracted, represent the
  actual movement of the light in the substance. If the vibrations
  take place perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, the direction
  of vibration is the same in both rays, and the actual amplitude
  is then the sum of the two expressions (11) and (13). If, on
  the other hand, the vibrations take place in the plane of incidence,
  they make different angles with the axes in the two rays. They
  are, as already stated, perpendicular to the ray; and if the posi

These equations bring us back again to the equations (30), (31),
and (34), if the components are independent of y.
   We can further conclude from the symmetrical form of the
equations (A), which is unaltered by changing the axes of coor
dinates, that they would still hold good aw, which has been
hitherto considered a function of .2: only, were any function what
ever of x, y, and z. Accordingly they express the general laws of
the motion of light in any non-absorbent heterogeneous medium.
    The principles which must serve for calculating the diffraction,
re<U+FB02>exiou, and refraction of light, or the conditions which must
obtain when light passes from one medium into another, can now
be easily deduced from these general equations. Let the plane
of coordinates yz be the limiting plane for which the conditions
are investigated. The equations will then be multiplied by da
 and by dz dw, and simply and doubly integrated from .z=O to
w=e, where e is a very small quantity. Now, however, all the
integrals will disappear except those whose elements become in<U+FB01>
nite, and this will be the case with those only which contain
differential coe<U+FB01>icients in relation to w. The second equation (A)
thus gives

thus obtained; but in the present case the <U+FB01>rst equation gives

    The four limiting equations (35) and (36) are, however, just
suf<U+FB01>cient for the calculation. The theory of elasticity, on the
other hand, gives six limiting conditions, whence we are also
obliged to assume the formation of longitudinal vibrations in
every case of refraction.
    It has been previously mentioned that the hypotheses which I
took (in Poggendor<U+FB01>"s Annalen, vol. cxi.) as the basis for the
calculation of the diffraction of light, are deducible from our <U+FB01>rst
assumptions (1) and (2). This is possible by the methods here
employed, if I multiply the equations (1) by dz and by dwdm,
and integrate simply and doubly from .z'=0 to .z'=e. The six
equations thus obtained express that the components of the vibra
tions, and the differential coefficients in relation to Z‘, are the same
on both sides of the plane a'=O.

XIII. An E.1.'perimentalE.z'amination of the so-called Storm-glass.
    By Cnanuzs ToMLINsoN, Lecturer on Physical Science, King’s
     College School, London*.
       HE storm-glass did not, I believe, hold rank as a scienti<U+FB01>c
         instrument until it was introduced by Admiral FitzRoy in
his useful public labours. In the Report for 1862 issued by the
Meteorological department of the Board of Trade, it is stated that
“if <U+FB01>xed, undisturbed, in free air, not exposed to radiation, <U+FB01>re,
or sun, but in the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room or
outer air1', the chemical mixture in a so-called storm-glass varies
in character with the direction of the wind, not its force, specially
(though it may so vary in appearance only) from another cause,
electrical tension.
    “As the atmospheric current veers toward, comes from, or is
approaching only from the polar direction, this chemical mixture
   * Communicated b the Author.                     _ _
   1‘ In Admiral Fitz y's ‘Weather Book’ (1863) it is said “preferably
in the outer air.”

  94         Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Experimental Examination
   (microscopically watched) grows like <U+FB01>r or fern leaves, hoar frost,
  or crystallizations.
      “ As it tends to the opposite quarter, the lines or spikes—all
  regular hard and crisp features—-gradually vanish.               Before and
   in a continued southerly wind, the mixture sinks gradually down
   wards in the vial till it becomes shapeless like melted sugar.
       “ Before or during the continuance of a northerly wind (polar
   current) the crystallizations are beautiful (if the mixture is cor
   rect, the glass a <U+FB01>iazture, and duly placed). The least motion of
   the liquid distur s them. The glass should be wiped clean now
   and then gently if exposed to rain or dust*.
       “ While any hard or crisp features are visible below, above, or
   at the top of the liquid (where they form for much north wind),
  there is plus electricity in the air; a mixture of polar current co
  existing in that locality with the opposite or southerly. When
  nothing but soft, melting, sugary substance is seen, the atmo
  spheric current (feeble or strong, as it may be) is southerly-1',
  unmixed with, and unin<U+FB01>uenced by, the contrary windi.
       “By repeated trials with a delicate galvanometer, applied to
   measure electrical tension in the air, I have proved these facts,
   and now <U+FB01>nd them useful for aiding, with the barometer and
  thermometer, in forecasting weather.
      “Temperature affects the mixture much, but not solely, as
_ many comparisons of winter with summer changes of tempera
  ture have fully demonstrated.”
      In the ‘Weather Book’ it is stated that 1“ clearness of the
  liquid, with more or less perfect crystallizations, accompanies a
  combination or a contest of the main currents by the west. And
  very remarkable these differences are,—the results of these air
  currents acting on each other from eastward, or entirely from an
  opposite direction, the west”
      The composition of the storm-glass is said to be “camphor,
  nitrate of potassium and sal-ammoniac, partly dissolved by
  alcohol, with water and some air, in a hermetically sealed glass
     '* In the ‘ Weather Book ’ it is added, “once or twice in a year the mix
  ture should be disturbed by inverting and gently shaking the glass vial.”
     1‘ In the ‘Weather Book ’ it is added, “with minus electricity.”
     I “ A confused appearance of the mixture with <U+FB02>aky spots or stars in
  motion and less clearness of the liquid indicates south-east wind, perhaps
  a gale.”
     § Several incidental passages in the ‘ Weather Book ’ confer a high
  scienti<U+FB01>c value on the storm-glass.   Thus at page 209 it is said that “ ther
  mometers and camphor-glasses also contribute their indications ” in predict
  ing local storms.   And again, page 232, “camphor-glasses in proper posi
  tions and duly attended are most useful to a quick eye and skilled percep
 tion.”

vial ;” and it is further added that "' there are many imitations
more or less incorrectly made.”
   The important services which this glass is said to afford to
meteorology render it desirable to know which is the imitation
and which the incorrect instrument.
   In ‘ The Druggist’s General Receipt Book,’ by Henry Beasley,
<U+FB01>fth edition, 186], page 4-28, the following recipe is given :—
“Take 2% drachms camphor, 38 grains nitre, and 38 grains
of sal-ammoniac, dissolve in 9 drachms water and 6 drachms
of recti<U+FB01>ed spirit with a gentle heat. The mixture is to be put
into a long glass tube and closed with a brass cap with a small
hole in it to admit air, or in an eau-de-cologne or other long
bottle tied over with bladder.” The account goes on to state that
the various changes of the storm-glass “are supposed to indicate
changes of weather, but the indications are not to be relied on.”
   It will be seen that the above directions do not agree with
Admiral FitzRoy’s, that the glass be hermetically sealed.
   In the last edition of ‘Ure’s Dictionary of Arts,’ &c., edited
by Mr. Robert Hunt, under the head CAMPHOR STORM-GLASSES
a similar recipe is given, except that 11 instead of '7 drachms of
recti<U+FB01>ed spirits of wine are prescribed; and it is stated, on the
authority of Dr. Parrion, that “ the weather-predicting qualities
of the instrument are false, and that light is the agent which,
together with temperature, in<U+FB02>uences the condition.”
   I have been unable to ascertain where Dr. Parrion’s paper is
published, nor have I succeeded in tracing the history of the
instrument. Admiral FitzRoy states that “considerably more
than a century ago what were called ‘ storm-glasses ’ were made
in this country.    Who was the inventor is now very uncertain;
but they were sold on old London Bridge, at the sign of the ‘Goat
and Compasses.’ ”
   Some years ago I purchased a storm-glass at an instrument
makefs shop in Hatton Garden, and received with it a paper, of
which the following is a copy :—
   “Cnmncal. WEATHER-GLASS, usually called a storm-glass,
which will correctly indicate the coming rain, high wind, storm,
or tempest.
   “This instrument will be preferable to others on account of
its portability and cheapness.
                           “ Indications.
   “ lst. For <U+FB01>ne weather, the substance will be low and smooth
at the bottom.
   “ 2nd. For rain, the substance will rise gradually in the shape
of feathers.
    “ 3rd. For high wind or storm, the substance will rise as above,

96       Mr. C. T0mliuson’s Experimental Examination
but much higher, partly at the top; sometimes white spots will
appear in motion, particularly in the <U+FB01>rst part of the change—
that denotes storm.
   “Experience has proved this instrument to be highly useful in
the prognostics of the changes that take place in the atmosphere,
ifproperly and correctly made.
   “The above instrument has been observed to indicate rain
forty-eight hours before it took place.”
   I have been in the habit of observing this instrument for some
years past, and had long ceased to regard it as of any value as a
weather-indicator, but supposed the various phenomena to be
brought about by the action of heat and light. While engaged,
however, in investigating the phenomena which accompany the
motion of camphor towards the light*, I was led to attend more
minutely to the storm-glass, and arrived at the conclusion that
heat is the only agent concerned, although the phenomena may
be complicated somewhat by the composition of the mixture and
the repeated crystallizations and solutions of the ingredients.
For example, nitre, which is freely soluble in water, is insoluble
in alcohol, the addition of which throws down a portion of the
salt from its aqueous solution; camphor, on the other hand, is
freely soluble in alcohol, and very sparingly so in water, so that
the addition of water to eamphorated spirit precipitates camphor.
The mixture is so composed that a portion of the solid is always
precipitated; and the effect of a rise of temperature is to take
up more of the solid, and of a fall in temperature to precipitate
it. As the liquid is in a state of saturation at a certain tempe
rature, the top crust and the lower deposit come into contact as
that temperature is approached; but this seldom happens, since
the crystallization of the solid renders sensible an amount of
latent heat, which again increases the solvent power of the men
struum independently of the external temperature. In <U+FB01>ne
weather also, especially if the glass have access to the external
air by means of a small hole or otherwise, there is a strong ten
dency for crystallization to take place at the surface where the
air, the crystals, and the sides of the glass meet. Adhesion
is thus promoted, so much so that the surface of the crust may
become dry and throw off vapour of camphor, which forms a cry-
stalline deposit on the dry portion of the glass above the liquid
on the side nearest the light, that is, on the coldest side.  This
upper crust is the principal seat of manufacture of the beautiful
feathers with transparent quills which may he often seen heaped
up on the lower deposit. As the feathers form above, they push
the feathers already formed away from their contact with the
           " See Philosophical Magazine for November 1862.

                     of the so-called Storm-glass.                97
  crust; and they gently subside and become heaped up below. A
  very large storm-glass (which will be described presently) shows
  this action well. The feathers formed above are not only
  pushed down by other feathers, but are also detached by a slight
  tremor or agitation; as also by a rise in temperature, which
 loosens their hold; and in descending slowly through the clear
 liquid they often turn over and settle down on the lower deposit,
 thus presenting the appearance of having started up from that
 deposit, which is the general notion. The feathers that turn
 over often have small lumps of the top crust attached to them,
 so that the root end, so to speak, is the heavier.     The minute
 stars which circulate between the upper crust and the lower de
 posit, which are said to indicate high wind or storm, are simple
 effects of cooling. During the months of April, May, and June
 1862, a storm-glass hanging in an east window so as to receive
the rays of the rising sun, constantly exhibited these stars moving
 in currents in the clear space between the two deposits after the
sun had left the window. These minute stars are exceedingly
beautiful, and consist of four, six, and eight radii, with several
 anomalous forms.
    The 01'dinary storm-glass, suspended so as to be near a window
 pane, will have its deposits often heaped up on the side near the
 cold glass, an effect which is most strikingly produced by put
 ting the storm-glass mixture into a large white glass ‘bottle in
 suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to <U+FB01>ll about two-thirds of it. In an experi
ment of this kind, the mixture was compounded of 20 drachms
of camphor, 304 grains of nitre, 30% grains of sal-ammoniac,
72 <U+FB02>uid-drachms of distilled water, 96 <U+FB02>uid-drachms of spirits
of wine, and 8 drops of oil of camphor. The mixture was gently
warmed in an evaporating-dish until it reached 98°; it was then
put into a quart white-glass bottle ; and the stopple was tied over,
the object. being to see the effect of hermetically sealing.
    On comparing this bottle with the storm-glass placed by the
side of it, the results were certainly such as to warrant the con
clusion that heat alone is the principle at work. The deposit
was invariably heaped up towards the window in the form of an
inclined plane, the perpendicular of which coincided with the
tangent formed by the cold window-pane and the curve of the
bottle; and this perpendicular varied in height from near the
surface of the liquid to about halfway down, according as the
night was cold or frosty, or the afternoon sun shone upon the
window. The <U+FB01>lm at the top would sometimes be con<U+FB01>ned
entirely to the side nearest the window. A little sunshine by
day would clear away this top crust entirely ; the cold of night
would bring it back, and, if colder than usual, would thicken it

and extend it over the whole surface, and it would be found in
the morning dropping down the beautiful camphor feathers. A
journal of this bottle, kept during November and December last,
with the temperatures noted, satisfy me that heat is the efficient
agent concerned in the results.
   The effect of hermetically sealing the bottle seemed to be in
this case a diminution of the upper crust, which was thin and
scanty compared with what it was in another large bottle to
which the mixture was afterwards transferred, and where access
was had by a small opening to the external air. This is exactly
what would be expected; for in the one case the space above
the liquid would always be saturated and prevent adhesion
between the surface and the air, while in the other case the
enclosed air would partake of _the pressure and hygrometric
condition of the external air, and not only allow a crust to be
formed, but assist it in throwing o<U+FB02>' vapour of camphor, which
would condense on the coldest side of the glass above the mix
ture, as already noticed.
   In order to ascertain the part that each ingredient plays in the
storm-glass mixture, it was examined separately under circum
stances calculated to exaggerate the phenomena. A solution of
nitre, for example, was raised to the boiling-point in a long glass
similar to that of the storm-glass, and the phenomena which
accompanied its cooling, together with the temperatures at
the top and at the bottom, were noted.          A similar experi
ment was performed with sal-ammoniac, camphor-julep, spirits
of wine, and water. The vessel selected for the purpose was
a large test-tube of thin German glass, 8% inches in length
and 1% inch in diameter, suspended from the ring of a retort
stand. Into this tube were poured 4 <U+FB02>uid-ounces of distilled
water, heat was applied, and 32 drachms of nitre were gra
dually added, the last portions being suspended in a muslin
bag just below the surface. The solution was raised to the
boiling-point and left to cool in a room the temperature of which
was 49°. Two thermometers were kept in the solution, the bulb
of one penetrating to the bottom nearly in contact with the glass,
and the bulb of the other just below the surface of the solution.
Both the thermometers range well together, and their stems are
enclosed in tubes welded to the bulbs and sealed at the top.
The experiment was conducted about two feet from a window,

       There are some points connected with the above experiment
   which, taken in connexion with a similar experiment with sal-am
   moniac, seem worthy of attention. The di<U+FB02>erence between the boil
   ing points of water at the bottom and just below the surface was
   noticed by Gay-Lussac* ; but after the boiling has been stopped
      ‘ Anmzles cle Chimie,xlix. 394 (1832). “ Suppose a volatile liquid of a
   certain depth to be submitted to ebullition. Two thermometers plunged
   into the liquid, one near the bottom, the other near its surface, will indi

100         Mr. C. Ton1linson’s Experimental Examination
and the solution left to cool, the great differences in tempera
ture between the bottom and top layers has not, so far as I
know, been hitherto observed*. It is known in a general way
that there is a difference, so that, in comparing thermometers in
hot water, means are taken to keep it stirred; but it has not, I
believe, been suspected that in a liquid column 7 inches high and
1% inch in diameter, supported in the air, as before described,
there may be a difference of 20° and upwards in the case of water,
and of 30° and upwards in the case of certain saline solutions be
tween the bottom and the top of the column. To show the reality
of the difference, the lower thermometer has been raised repeatedly
to the level of the upper one, and the two readings corresponded.
In the experiment with nitrc the maximum difference was 13° in
favour of the upper thermometer, but in the course of a few
 minutes this difference was reduced to 6°; soon after which a
 few short crystalline shoots were observed at the bottom, and a
little after crystals were seen at the surface; the lower thermo
meter now marked ahighcr temperature than the upper one, and
 went on increasing until the maximum difference in its favour
was also 13°. As soon as crystallization set in, the tempera
tures declined slowly as compared with the cooling before that
event. From the removal of the lamp to the crystallizing-point,
the solution cooled down 88° in 16 minutes, viz. from 228° to
 140°.    From the crystallizing-point to the conclusion of the
experiment, the cooling was 66° in 85 minutes, viz. from 140° to
 74°, and that in a room without a <U+FB01>re, where the temperature
was 49°, and the solution was within about2 feet of the window.
    A similar experiment was tried with sal-ammoniac, the details
of which are given in the following Table :—
cate two different temperatures corresponding to the pressures in these
positions : the vapour formed at the bottom of the vessel, experiencing a less
degree of pressure in proportion as it ascends, dilutes and cools until the
moment when, attaining the surface of the liquid, its elastic force becomes
equal to the pressure of the atmosphere. The temperature of the emerging
vapour, or, what is the same thing, the last liquid layer, is exactly that of
boiling under a given atmospheric pressure.”
   * Count Rumford, in one of his essays to prove the non-conductibility
of water for heat, pointed out how a column of water with a lump of ice
attached to the bottom might show various temperatures between 40° and
l8U_° F. Saussure also noticed in Lake Lncerne that the water at a depth
of 640 feet had a temperature of 41° F., while at the surface it was 68§°.

    ln the sal-ammoniac experiment, the phenomena of crystal
 lization are striking and beautiful. Crystals like miniature ferns
or <U+FB01>r-trees start up from the bottom ; and just over this minute
forest a snow-storm sets in and quickly buries it in a multitude
of minute six-rayed stars perfectly sharp and distinct to the naked
eye, each radius fringed with spikes of unequal length diminish
ing to the point. The stars descend gently, conveying the noise
less idea of falling snow, and the storm becomes slowly propa
gated upwards until the whole tube is <U+FB01>lled with these falling
stars, and the lower thermometer is half buried.                                                     The heat
liberated by the crystals sets currents in motion, and some of the
stars struggle to force their way upwards by the axis of the tube.
Meanwhile a crust forms on the surface like an inverted forest,
the temperatures decline, and, when the ditl'erence between them
is extinguished, the liquid between the top crust and the mass
of snow beneath becomes bright and still.
   I cannot fancy a prettier sight than this exhibited to an audience
by means of the oxyhydrogen or electrical lamp. The experi
ment may be prepared for such a purpose, or for any one who
wishes to see this beautiful effect in miniature, in the following
                                                                       \

 102        Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Experimental Examination
 manncr:—-pour 3 drachms of distilled water into a small test
 tube, and put into this about 40 grains of sal-ammoniac; suspend
 the tube by a piece of twine from the ring of a retort-stand or
 in any other convenient manner, and carefully boil the solution
 by means of a spirit-lamp. As soon as the lamp is removed,
 lower the tube into cold water so as to chill the solution to the
 crystallizing-point, and, the moment crystals appear at the bottom
 of the tube, remove it from the water and leave it suspended in
 the air. The minute snow-storm will soon set in, and will con
 tinue for nearly an hour. When the action is over, the tube
 may be corked and set aside for repetition at some future time.
     These experiments show how important a part sal-ammoniac
 plays in the storm-glass. The fern-leaf <U+FB01>gures and the stars,
 which are usually referred to the camphor, are produced chie<U+FB02>y
 by the sal-ammoniac. The stars, moreover, show very decidedly
 the action of cooling, not of windy weather, as it is said ; or if
 wind has any effect, it is in cooling the storm-glass mixture ; and
 the appearance of these stars in greater or less galaxies is but a
 sign of the greater or less, or more slow or more rapid rate of
 cooling.
    A solution of camphor in cooling gives no de<U+FB01>nite <U+FB01>gures, but
 <U+FB02>akes very much like snow-<U+FB02>akes, which descend from the surface,
 and minute particles of camphor, which ascend in such quantities
 as to make the solution nearly opake. The solution was in the
 <U+FB01>rst instance made with 4 ozs. of distilled water, 1 oz. of spirits
 of wine, and 5 a drachm of camphor. The solution boiled at 194.9
 for the lower, and 192° for the upper thermometer. When the
readings were 136° and 140°, a cloudy appearance set in at the
bottom, and multitudes of what looked like air-bubbles ascended,
and soon formed ascending and descending currents. When the
readings were 127° and 137°, the <U+FB02>akes descended as before
described. Next morning the <U+FB02>akes were collected at the bottom
as in the storm-glass, and particles were sailing up and down
in the clear liquid. The tube was placed in hot water, and
the solution was <U+FB01>ltered; it now contained much less camphor,
and at 116° and 118° the minute particles appeared, which
increased with the cooling, and <U+FB02>akes smaller than those before
obtained also ascended and descended in the bright liquid. On
the former occasion it was turbid from the multitude of particles.
    Several experiments were made with distilled water, one of
which was in a tube 9 inches long, 1% inch in diameter; the
length of the liquid column was about 7 3} inches, 5 <U+FB02>uid-ounces
of water being employed, and the temperature of the room was
63°.

    It is perfectly well known that in an experiment of this kind
 the cooling takes place chie<U+FB02>y by means of currents set in mo
tion in the external air, which generate a similar current in the
liquid, the warmer particles ascending by the axis of the tube,
and the colder ones descending by the sides; so that while this
 process goes on, the upper thermometer will mark a higher tem
perature than the lower. In a saline solution several additional
phenomena are to be observed, many of which do not belong to
this inquiry ; but it may be noticed that even in salts which do
not form supersaturated solutions, such as sal-ammoniac, the
 solution remains <U+FB02>uid some time after the lamp has been removed,
while crystallization endeavours to establish itself at the surface
where the air and the liquid meet. Although it is quite true
that the upper thermometer marks a considerably higher tempe
rature than the lower, yet the coldest portion of the olution
before crystallization sets in is that very thin <U+FB01>lm which is in
actual contact with the air. I have seen in a saturated solution
of sal-ammoniac at the boiling-point, directly after the lamp has
been removed, a crystalline <U+FB01>lm form and disappear many times
before it could establish itself on the surface. A similar struggle
goes on in the case of supersaturated solutions, although in such
case the <U+FB01>lm may not be visible.                  It is dissolved, so to speak, in
the very act of forming; but its existence is made quite evident
by the saccharine-like streams which descend from the sur
face during the cooling, and are identical in character with those
which accompany actual crystallization in other parts of the tube.
There are many other points connected with the cooling and
crystallization of solutions of hydrated and anhydrous salts, which
I may perhaps be allowed to describe on another occasion. In
conclusion, I give a few details respecting a storm-glass bottle
so arranged as to note the upper and lower temperatures.
   A white glass cylindrical bottle, 5% inches high exclusive of
the short neck, and 3 inches in diameter, of the capacity of 20
<U+FB02>uid-ounces, with an opening at the top and another at the side
near the bottom, was <U+FB01>lled about <U+FB01>ve-sixths full with a storm
glass mixture, and a thermometer, passed through a cork, was
placed in each tubulure; a third thermometer was suspended on

104        Mr. C. Tomlinson’s Ezzperimcntal Examina/ion
one side, and a fourth (a register) was placed on the other side.
The bottle with its thermometers was mounted in a west window
at noon on the 29th of December, 1862, all four thermometers
marking 51°. This arrangement was maintained about three
months, and a register was kept of the temperatures and the
appearance of the bottle two or three times a day. A few short
selections from this register will be suf<U+FB01>cient for our purpose.
The upper thermometer had an elongated bulb, half of which
dipped below the surface of the mixture. This thermometer will
be referred to by the word “upper,” while that in the lower
tubulure by the word “lower,” the third thermometer by the
word “outside,” and the fourth by the word “ register.”
   On the morning after the arrangement was made the readings
were as follows :—
   Dec. 30, 1862.                  O                O                 O

   The top crust, which was abundant and much clustered about
the bulb of the upper thermometer at 8.30, had disappeared when
the afternoon reading was made. At night numerous stars were
circulating in the clear portion of the mixture.

    The lower deposit heaped up towards window like a steep hill
hollowed out and covered with beautiful foliage.             Fern-like
<U+FB01>gures also projecting down from the top crust, but most abun
dantly on the side nearest the window.
    All these various phenomena seem to be perfectly accounted
for by di<U+FB01>'erence of temperature. In order to exaggerate these
differences, I attached to the side of the bottle nearest the win
dow, about the middle, a black paper ring 1-,} inch in outer -
diameter, and -glths of an inch inner diameter, so as to leave a
black ring gths of an inch wide.          In putting on the ring the
bottle was disturbed a little, so that some of the top feathers fell
down, and turned over in doing so. The ring was just below
the summit of the deposit, and was quite invisible from the
room.     In about an hour, however, that is, about 2 P.M., its dark
outline was quite evident, the heat absorbed by it having thinned
away the crystals.                            a

      I think it may fairly be concluded from these experiments and
  observations that the storm-glass acts as a rude kind of thermo
  scopc, inferior, for most of the purposes of observation, to the
  thermometer. It does not seem to be capable of reference to a
  standard, and hence observations made with it scarcely admit of
  being registered, although attempts at a scale are made by some
  instrument-makers If, however, two or more of such gra
  duated instruments be placed in and about a house, their indi
- cations will vary considerably, according as they are more or less
  exposed to the action of radiation; and it is difficult to see ho\v
  the glass can be protected from radiation except by enclosing it
  in another glass ; and under such circumstances its action will be
  very feeble.
     Instrument-makers insist on the integrity of the mixture, the
  composition of which they keep secret. This, of itself, ought to
  exclude the instrument from the Meteorological Observatory. It
  is possible that some storm-glass maker may re<U+FB02>ect on the charac
  ter of my paper on the ground that the mixture adopted by me
  is not the correct one. I have formed a number of these glasses
  according to the recipe given, and <U+FB01>nd them to act very well.
  The mixture must be heated, but gently, otherwise the sal-am
  moniac will separate from the other ingredients. WVhen poured
 into the tube, corked and suspended, the glass may require a
  day or two before it begins to act properly ; but a little shaking or
 exposure to thesun, or thinning down by the addition of a small
 portion of spirit or of water, will soon make the glass act properly.
 Two tubes containing the same mixture, were placed, one in the
 window, and the other in a test-glass within a foot of the win
 dow ; the <U+FB01>rst acted well, the second did not act at all, on account

                        By Josnrn GILL, Esq.
                   To John Tyndall, Esg., F.R.S. 850. '
       Sm,                       -
 AT the present time, when the subject of thermo-dynamics is
         beginning to attract more general attention from the
 scienti<U+FB01>c public, every little contribution of new light may be
 useful in aiding the progress of discovery in “ a region which,”
 as you have justly remarked, “promises possessions richer than
 any hitherto granted to the intellect of man.” As an obscure
 labourer in this grand <U+FB01>eld of science, I ought perhaps to apo
 logize for asking from you, as an Editor of the Philosophical
 Journal, the favour of making public, through its pages, a few
 remarks which may not be useless towards clearing away some
 of the obscurity which appears to me still to overhang the very
<U+FB01>rst steps of our progress; and in explanation I may be allowed
to say that the subject has been of deep and fascinating interest
to me, from the dim foreshadowing of the theory sketched by
Séguin twenty-four years ago, and the powerful outlines drawn
soon after by the master hand of Mayer, down through the mass
of important experimental evidence of Joule, backed by the labours
of Thomson, Clausius, Regnault, and Helmholtz, to Professor
Rankinc’s thermo-dynamics in his recent work on Prime Movers.
And while I have been endeavouring to grasp in some degree
the philosophy of the subject from the works of others, I have
not omitted to aid my own speculations and researches with
numerous original experiments made under circumstances of no
little difficulty, but, I venture to hope, not utterly in vain.
   I ought candidly to declare at once that my long investigation
of the practical working of the steam-engine, and my numerous
experiments with hot air as a motive agent, forced me many years
ago reluctantly to doubt that any heat, contained under the com
mon form of heat by the elastic <U+FB02>uids, is directly converted into
work in the action of thermic prime movers; and it has been a
source of sincere regret to me that a beautiful theory, elaborated
with admirable skill by some of the <U+FB01>rst intellects of the age, and
which, applied to some grand cosmical phenomena, gives results

110        Mr. J. Gill on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.
bearing the impress of correctness, should still be obviously
erroneous as applied to the working of the commonest steam
engine.
   The current doctrine of thermo-dynamics assumes that all the
heat which passes from the <U+FB01>re to a steam-boiler takes the form
of molecular motion, or vis viva, in the steam, and that the work
performed is so much of this molecular motion given out by the
steam in its passage through the engine; consequently that the
steam must contain less heat or molecular motion after it has
done work than before, and that the quantity of heat which
disappears by being thus transformed into work is in the pro
portion of the mechanical equivalent of heat, which experiment
has <U+FB01>xed at 772 lbs. raised one foot by a quantity of heat which
will raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water 1 degree of Fahren
heit.   Accordingto this doctrine, molecular motion is transferred
from the <U+FB01>re to the steam, and a small portion of this molecular
motion is transferred from the steam to the work done, or trans
formed into this work, by far the largest portion remaining in
the steam after the operation is <U+FB01>nished.
   Like Séguin a quarter of a century back, and like M. Hirn of
Colmar very recently, I <U+FB01>nd in the condenser of the engine all
the heat originally contained in the steam, after allowing for
known losses; but, unlike M. Hirn, my reason will not allow
me to alter my views and to interpret facts to suit a theory,
however well supported by authority. I hope this open declara
tion of partial dissent will not prevent my obtaining a fair hear
ing while I endeavour to show that the observed facts are not ne
cessarily discordant with sound theory, though in the brief space
to which I must here limit myself, my exposition must be very
imperfect; but my chief end will be attained if my suggestions
should fortunately induce an unprejudiced reconsideration of the
subject by superior intellects.
   It may be well to remark here that I am quite convinced of
the general correctness of that part of the dynamical theory of
heat which treats of the conversion of work into the molecular
motion supposed to constitute heat in common matter; and I
hope that science will soon clear up the obscurity which still enve
lopes the converse phenomenon, or the change of heat into work.
   The material universe in its lowest or most external manifes
tation, presents to a super<U+FB01>cial glance only matter and motion.
On deeper investigation it is perceived that matter is under the
in<U+FB02>uence of principles of energy or force, or is endowed with such
principles which cannot be satisfactorily explained as general
results of motion,—thougb much ingenuity has been displayed in
attempting to account for the phenomena of terrestrial gravita
tion as the result of the earth’s axial rotation and revolution in

            Mr. J. Gill on the Dynamical Theory ofHeat.          111
  its orbit; and also in applying the well-known principle of cen
  trifugal force of matter in masses to the phenomena of molecular
  repulsion or elasticity in vapours and gases, by hypotheses of
  molecular vortices which may hold good partially, but are not
  su<U+FB02>icient to explain all the phenomena of this class which come
 under our observation. The two great principles of energy or
 force which seem to include all others, are attraction and repul
 sion'; and it might be more reasonably argued that, in the
 majority of phenomena, motion is the result of these forces.
 Perhaps the most probable supposition is that they were coex
 istent with motion from the creation of things. It must, how
 ever, be allowed that, as far as our observation extends, there is
 a universal and immutable connexion between the motion of
 matter or via viva, and the more occult principles or properties
 of attraction and repulsion in bodies at rest; so that whenever
 motion or vis viva disappears, it is replaced by equivalent energy
 under the form of attraction or repulsion in a statical condition
 of disturbed equilibrium. And, conversely, every case of resto
 ration of disturbed statical equilibrium must give rise to equiva
 lent motion or vis viva. In other words, dynamical energy is the
 force of motion, or via viva; and statical (or potential) energy is
 a state of disturbed equilibrium of attraction or repulsion; and,
 as <U+FB01>rst clearly expounded by Mayer, these different forms of
 energy are convertible. Heat, as we observe it in common
 matter, is allowed to be molecular motion, and the calori<U+FB01>c
 energy of the hottest <U+FB02>ame to be only the vis viva of the excited
 material particles. As heat is the proximate cause of work in
thermie prime movers, it is reasonable to suppose that all the
energy corresponding to the work done by a steam-engine must
pass from the <U+FB01>re into the steam, and from the steam to the
work done. The heat required to form the steam is allowed to
be constant, or nearly so, under different pressures ; and one cubic
foot of steam under a pressure of ten atmospheres, quietly con
densed in the vessel which contains it, will communicate to the
condensed water only the same quantity of heat as ten cubic feet
of steam of atmospheric pressure equally condensed. If the
cubic foot of high-pressure steam be allowed to expand gradu
ally, by enlarging the space it occupies, against a moderated
resistance until its bulk becomes ten cubic feet, supposing no
heat to be lost or applied in the process, it is perceived that it
will be identical with the ten cubic feet of steam formed at atmo
spheric pressure; but expansion under moderated resistance
necessarily produces work, and, in fact, the work produced by
the high-pressure steam would be three times more than the low
pressure steam can produce. The energy equivalent to this
remarkable difference of amount of work must exist in the high

pressure stcam,—but not as heat or molecular vis viva; for the
steam contains only the vis viva of its heat of conversion, or
change of state.
   Imagine a mass of ten cubic feet of atmospheric-pressure steam
to be compressed by exterior force into the space of one cubic
foot, supposing no heat to be lost or applied in the process, and
excluding the idea of friction ; it will be allowed that the result
ing cubic foot of steam will be identical with a cubic foot of
steam formed directly by the agency of <U+FB01>re under a pressure of
ten atmospheres. A radical mistake in the doctrine of thermo
dynamics is the assumption that compression, apart from the idea
offriction, is a source of heat. In elastic <U+FB02>uids it is evidently
only a cause of concentration of heat, or increase of temperature
resulting from a change of latent heat into sensible, as it would
be commonly expressed. This all-important difficulty must be
fairly met, and this corner stone in the foundation of the theory
must be satisfactorily placed before the superstructure can be of
permanent value. -It is obvious that a very large amount of
energy exists in high-pressure steam (and in compressed gases)
which is not molecular motion, or heat as described by the dyna
mical theory, but quiet, statical energy, or force wound up,
ready to give out equivalent work when the <U+FB02>uid is allowed to
expand against moderated resistance, or to be converted into
interior heat, or molecular motion of its own mass when allowed
to increase its volume by free tumultuous expansion.
   This packed up energy must be repulsion in some shape; but
it cannot be the centrifugal repulsion of molecular vortices,
because that must be a result of existing motion; and it is seen
that no corresponding motion exists in the compressed <U+FB02>uids.
Physical phenomena present numerous instances of the action of
statical repulsion quite distinct from the idea of centrifugal force ;
and it was said above, that when motion or vis viva disappears,
it is replaced by equivalent energy under the form of attraction
or repulsion in a statical condition of disturbed equilibrium.
The heat of conversion of water into steam passes from the <U+FB01>re
to the <U+FB02>uid as molecular motion, whether of vibration or rotation
is a question of minor importance, if we allow that the work
producing power is not dynamical centrifugal force. Something
equivalent to the work-producing power must also be supposed
to pass from the <U+FB01>re to the steam. If it is energy existing in the
<U+FB01>re as molecular vis viva or dynamical force, it must be supposed
to disappear as such in the act of transfer to the steam, and to
assume, for the time, the equivalent form or condition of molecular
repulsion in the state of statical force, under the in<U+FB02>uence of some
opposing statical resistance. And, conversely, when the opposing
statical resistance is removed, vis viva or motion reappears either as

             Mr. J. Gill on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.         113
  exterior work, or interior molecular motion, in re-establishing the
   previous state of equilibrium. It is not requisite to suppose the
  direct or immediate reappearance of the vis viva in restoring
  equilibrium in any one operation ; for equilibrium may be equally
  restored by a transfer of force which may disappear from one body
  to reappear in another under the same form; but sooner or
  later in the rotation of phenomena the transformation takes place,
  for when one form of energy disappears altogether, it must be
  substituted by another.
     But if high-pressure steam be quietly condensed in the vessel
  which contains it, by simply withdrawing the heat of conversion,
 or change of state, the excess of energy above mentioned disap
 pears entirely. What becomes of it ? I submit that this question
 must be answered before the dynamical theory of heat can be
 received as satisfactory or rational, as far as human knowledge
 at present extends.
     The recent experiments of M. Hirn showed that when high
 pressure steam expands tumultuously into a condenser, heat is
 created; that is to say, more heat appears in the condenser than
 was contained originally in the steam. The fact is not disputed,
 but it is explained by saying that the particles of the steam rush
 into the condenser with immense velocity, while the water which
 results from their condensation is quiet; and as the vis viva co
 existent with velocity in the motion of translation of the particles
 remains in the condenser, it must assume the form of molecular
 motion known as heat. I submit that this explanation is not
 satisfactory, though it may be a correct statement of the mole
cular phenomena. The steam, as high-pressure steam, contains
only the heat (molecular motion) of conversion, or change of
state, which is allowed to be a nearly constant quantity under
different circumstances of temperature and pressure; and this is
the quantity which appears when the steam is condensed under
pressure. But the vis viva or molecular motion of the steam is
more after tumultuous expansion than before, and therefore steam
so expanded is superheated, as directly proved by experiments of
Siemens, and by my own ; consequently it must be allowed that
in its compressed state it possesses something which is not quan
titative thermometric heat for the time, though always accom
panied by higher temperature in the steam, but which produces
work if the steam expands under moderated resistance, and heat
if it expands tumultuously.
    Analogous to the foregoing case are Joule’s remarkable expe
riments of 1845, in which compressed air was expanded to an
equal degree by two di<U+FB01>erent methods-—<U+FB01>rst, by a gradual en
largement of the containing space under moderated pressure, by
 which exterior work was performed, accompanied with (apparent)

loss of heat; and secondly, by free tumultuous expansion from
the containing vessel into an annexed vacuous receiver, by which
no exterior work was performed, and no loss of heat was observed.
It was deduced that heat disappeared in the <U+FB01>rst case, being
converted into the equivalent work produced; and that in the
second case no heat disappeared because no work was done.
These striking experiments drew the attention of scienti<U+FB01>c men
to the subject of the new theory; and Regnault in particular
interested himself in repeating them with the variety and accu
racy suggested ».by his great experience in thermic researches.
He announced to the Academy of Sciences ten years ago that his
experiments fully con<U+FB01>rmed -Ioule’s results, and from that time
he became an open partisan of the new theory
    The facts of these experiments are correct (indeed they could
hardly have been otherwise in the hands of such able experi
menters); but I submit that the explanation given to them is
incorrect. The compressed air was of the high tension of twenty
two atmospheres, and to produce this tension no small amount of
work must have been expended. The energy equivalent to this
work was certainlytaken from some exterior source and transferred
to the air. If no heat escaped during the compression, the tem
perature would rise very considerably, from the change of latent
heat to sensible; and when the air was allowed to expand back
to its former volume under moderated resistance, an amount of
work would be produced equal to that expended on the compres
sion, the temperature falling to its original point by a changing
back of sensible heat to latent. If the escape of heat is not pre
vented during compression, the dense air, at the temperature of
the surrounding atmosphere, will contain much less heat than it
held at the initial density with the same temperature, and its
tension will be proportionately less than if the heat were retained.
If no heat be allowed to re-enter the air-vessel during the expan
sion, the temperature will fall very considerably, and less work
will be produced by the smaller amount of expansion which,
under these circumstances, will restore the equilibrium.      In the
former case all the energy put into the compressed <U+FB02>uid remains
in it as statical energy, or packed-up force, while the state of
compression lasts; and in the latter case, part of the communi
cated energy escapes with the heat, and the rest remains stored
up in the compressed <U+FB02>uid. This latter state of things repre
sents the initial condition of the compressed air in .Ioule’s expe
riments; and it is evident that if the air be allowed to expand
by gradually enlarging the space which contains it, exterior work
-will be produced, and the temperature of the expanding <U+FB02>uid will
fall by a change of part of its sensible heat into latent, the whole
quantity of heat remaining the same notwithstanding the fall of
temperature.

             Mr. J. Gill on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.        115
      But as the water of the calorimeter was, as well as the com
   pressed air, of the atmospheric temperature at the commence
   ment of the experiment, the fall of temperature in the expanding
   air will naturally cause it to take heat from the surrounding
  water until an equilibrium of temperature is established. Hence
  results in the expanded air what is called a disappearance of heat,
  which is supposed to be converted into the work produced by
  the expansion—the real state of the case being that the expanded
  air has produced the work without any loss of heat, but only a
  fall of temperature; and therefore it must be conceived that the
  operation of compression gave it energy which it did not possess
  before, and that this energy is for the time of a form very differ
  ent from heat. In fact the compressed air contained statical
  energy like the tension of a wound-up spring, and the principle
  of conservation is satis<U+FB01>ed by the recovery of the mechanical
  work expended to compress the air in preparing the experiment;
  so that loss of heat is not required to strike the balance.
     In the other case of Joule’s experiment, where the compressed
 air expanded tumultuously into the annexed vacuous receiver,
 no exterior work was produced; but, as in Hirn’s experiment of
 the tumultuous expansion of high-pressure steam, an increase of
 the total heat of the <U+FB02>uid must result. And as the expansion in
 the emitting vessel must be attended with a corresponding fall
 of temperature (though without loss of heat), the extra heat pro
 duced by the tumultuous motion of the exhausting air in the
 other vessel would compensate this fall of temperature by satis
 tying the increased capacity of the expanded <U+FB02>uid for heat, and
no reduction of temperature would be perceived in the water of
the calorimeter. This state of things is explained by saying that,
as no work was performed, no heat disappeared; but the real
fact is, that the quantity of heat in the apparatus at the end of
the experiment exceeds the initial quantity by the additional
heat developed by the tumultuous expansion of the air into the
comparatively vacuous receiver. And here, again, the result
accords with the principle of conservation, as the mechanical
work spent on the compression in preparing the experiment is
not recovered, but instead of it we have the equivalent heat.
    In considering of this and of analogous experiments, the candid
inquirer must perceive that in no case can he detach or isolate
his operations from the mass of physical conditions around him,
and that consequently results which might otherwise be regarded
as absolute are only relative—a consideration of prime import
ance in such investigations; for where everything is relative, and
no absolute initial and <U+FB01>nal points can be determined in the ever
changing circuit of elemental phenomena, the principle of con
servation may be strictly preserved where we do not directly

116            Mr. J. J. Waterston on the Expansion
perceive it. It must be allowed that our ideas of the action of
heat as a source of work are still very obscure. The patient and
almost silent researches of twenty years, perfectly unbiassed by
partial in<U+FB02>uences of any kind, have convinced me that work is
directly convertible into heat by friction, but that heat is not
directly convertible into work. It is certain that in elastic <U+FB02>uids
it is the quality or condition of the heat, and not its quantity,
which is the measure of the dynamical equivalent. Caloritic
energy is not simply the molecular motion known as heat ; and
“ the phenomenon which we call heat, as a dynamical agent, may
be only the exhibition of certain states (or conditions) of the
particles of matter, dependent on, and correlative with, forces in
which they are involved.”

      XV. On the Expansion of Water at High Temperatures.
                     By J. J. Wunnsrou, E'sq.*
                          [With Three Plates]
 IN the account given ofalaw of liquid expansion in the Philo
       sophical Magazine for June 1861, it was stated that water
 alone, of all the liquids examined, did not conform to the law in
 the lower part of the scale of temperature, and that even up to
 200°1' it showed no tendency to do so. My attention has lately
 been drawn to this subject again by having occasion to graduate
 a water-thermometer. The inequality in the rate of expansion
 of water is so great that, to obtain even moderate accuracy in the
 scale, it was requisite to <U+FB01>nd the law of the differences. To do
 this a scale of equal parts was attached to the stem, and 7x, the
 length between to and t, (two near temperatures), was divided
 by t,—t0, and the quotient set off as ordinate to §(to+t,), the
 middle temperature ; the points were found to range in a straight
 line that came down and crossed the axis at 4° nearly. It would
 thus appear that the rate of expansion increased exactly in the
 simple ratio of the distance from 4°, and it would seem that the
 curve of expansion was the conic parabola having its vertex at
 the point of minimum volume.              '
    Let PL represent unity or volume at 4°, and NQ,=v the

       curve of expansion PQ is a                                       A
       parabola, .z cc 3/9, and got. y. I
       had previously examined the                               P
       observations of M. Despretz
      both above and below the mini
       mum point, and found that from
      50° downwards to as far below
      0° as the liquid condition can
      (by perfect stillness of the water)
      be maintained, they could be                              35                    N
      very accurately represented, not by a parabola, but by an ellipse
      FPQ, the curvature of expansion below P being greater than
      that above, and F A, the axis of the ellipse, being inclined to L N,
      the axis of temperature. On this account the curve was to be
     considered as onlyempirical,and therefore of no value in advancing
     the thermo-molecular physics of water. But now the question
     occurred, after seeing how the ordinates of graduation ranged,
     might not the curve above 50°conform to the parabola? might not
     the small de<U+FB02>ection from it in the lower part of the scale be the
     abnormal e<U+FB02>"ect of the crystallizing force gradually increasing
     towards the lower temperatures?
          §2. To test this, reference was made to the Table of the
     expansion of water up to 210°, given in note E of the paper
     “On Liquid Expansion” above referred to; and since, if the
     curve was a parabola, d.z' or do 0!: y or cl’v constant, it was easy
    to test the point in question by examining the second differences
   of the volumes in that Table, which had been carefully reduced
    to intervals of 5° of the air-thermometer (C.A.).
         The following is the Table with <U+FB01>rst and second differences :

    It will be remarked that from 50° to 150° the second differ
ences are sensibly uniform, their exact mean being 17'5.       Now
the parabola being de<U+FB01>ned by the equation a.z=_z/3, to <U+FB01>nd a we
have the differential equation 2(dy)‘*=ad°.v, in which a'y=5°,
d9 '='000175, hence a=2857l4; and since .z'=v—b and
y=t—c, in which v is the volume at t temperature, we have
2857l4(v—b)= (I-09), in which I; and c may be computed from
two observations, or they may be computed from one observation
and its <U+FB01>rst difference. But the most exact method is to com
pute a, b, and c directly from the volumes at 50°, 100°, and
150°; we thus obtain
         loga=5'45196, b=-99710, and ¢=-14-4025.
This parabola passes through the tabular volumes at 50°, 100°,
and 150°; and at 75° the volume is smaller than the tabular
number by one-twelfth of a degree, and at 125° it is larger than
the tabular by one-sixteenth of a degree. Above 150° the para
bola sensibly diverges from the tabular volumes; at 200° the
 difference corresponds to 1".     But, as stated in Note E, these
higher observations were of inferior value. The tubes were
 unfortunately of soft glass, which are corroded by steam under
 200°. It was thus still an open question whether \vater expanded
in a parabola. The simplicity of the curve was inviting, although,
 if con<U+FB01>rmed at the higher temperatures, it would be fatal to the
 generality of the law of expansion. 1 therefore endeavoured to
 obtain observations at such high temperatures as would settle
the point.
     §3. This has proved a much more di<U+FB02>icult task than was
 anticipated, and has occupied several months.
     Below 200° it is comparatively easy to obtain good observa
 tions in tubes 20 inches long. In previous researches 1 employed
 concentric boxes or hoods, in which a current of heated air, after
 ascending on the outside of the inner one (which contained the
 tubes and thermometers), was directed downwards upon the
 tubes before escaping by the funnel, which also passed upwards
  through the inner hood. Some attempts to follow this method
 on a smaller scale having failed, I resorted to an open tube held
  over Bunsen-<U+FB01>ames, and after a good deal of labour and many
  failures was at last successful in obtaining good observations up
  to 335°, which afford distinct proof that the curve of expansion
  above 200° conforms to the general law.
     To establish this decisively, requires observations above 300°;
  and unfortunately it is just at this temperature that difficulties
  accumulate on all sides. To overcome these, required a kind of
  apprenticeship to be served.
     I shall now describe the method <U+FB01>nally adopted and employed

                    of Water at High Temperatures.             119'
 in the last series, so that they may be repeated without obstacle
 to success.
    §4. The difficulties that beset the inquiry come from three
 sources. 1. The glass tube that contains the water must be
 vertical; and, to prevent the liquid column from breaking up by
 the formation of vapour-bubbles below its summit, the tempera-'
ture should be an increasing one upwards, whereas the natural
gradient of a simple heater is a decreasing one upwards. 2.
The hard German glass, though more impervious to the solvent
power of water than soft glass, begins to whiten and cloud below
300°, and generally becomes mottled with opake patches just at
the very part of the tube where clear vision is indispensable.
There is also a certain amount of the liquid absorbed, apparently,
but which may be partially recovered by heating. 3. To obtain
certainty as to the mean temperature of the liquid column, it
was thought proper to use as thermometer a tube of the same
length as the water-tube, <U+FB01>lled with a liquid of great expansi
bility and high boiling-point. To graduate such thermometers
by comparison with ordinary bulb-thermometers, it was neces
sary to have an open bath of a similar liquid and transparent in a
glass vessel su<U+FB02>iciently deep to contain the tube held vertical.
The fumes of such liquids heated towards 300° become over
powering, and reliable comparisons can hardly be obtained
above 250°.
    § 5. The ordinary chemical thermometers, having a vacuum at
the top of the stem, are not to be depended upon at temperatures
near the boiling-point of mercury, as vapour is sometimes gene
rated below. Besides they are graduated so as to require the
stem to be of the same temperature as the bulb. I therefore
had one made with short stem and bulb strong enough to with
stand high pressures, containing air over the mercury. It was
about the same length as the water-tubes, and 100° measured
about if-ths of an inch. After being heated to 400°, it was gradu
ated and marked off in divisions of 10°, and did not alter in its
reading afterwards. It is represented by Pl. 111. <U+FB01>g. 7. Another
two of a similar kind were also provided; and, each being gradu
ated by itself and afterwards compared with the others, the highest
temperatures would have been well determined if it depended only
upon thermometers.
   § 6. Graduating lubes.—Fig. 3 (Pl. II.) is afull-size represent
ation of the last of the six water-tubes employed. It was pre
pared by <U+FB01>rst cleaning out, before sealing, with sulphuric acid,
then by distilled water, then dried by heating. The bottom
was then closed at the <U+FB02>ame, and allowed to remain in it until
the glass thickened.        The top was then sealed before <U+FB01>lling,
employing a very small Bunsen-<U+FB02>ame.             In operating with

120'           Mr. J. J‘. Waterston on the Expansion
 small <U+FB02>ame, the tube after a pull will contract of itself with-'
 out being drawn; the glass is thus kept thick and strong;
and the <U+FB02>ame being slowly withdrawn while the tube is kept
revolving, a strong conical point may be obtained. This is
<U+FB01>led down until a small needle-point opening appears. Before
<U+FB01>lling the tube, a scale of twenty divisions to the inch is
<U+FB01>nely and carefully marked upon the glass, as shown in
<U+FB01>g. 3.      The mode of doing so is shown in <U+FB01>g. 6. The
feather edge of the ivory scale resting on the glass, the lines
were drawn with a <U+FB01>ne-pointed lithographic steel pen, using a
watchmaker’s lens. The ink was of gamboge, rubbed down in
water and darkened with black. When dry, the marked portion
 of the tube was passed through a small <U+FB02>ame, gradually heating
 until, when near red heat, the lines are observed suddenly to turn
 black; it is then to be quickly withdrawn. The lines are thus
 ingrained upon the glass, and cannot be easily rubbed off. The
 tube is then <U+FB01>lled with distilled water to about the proportion
 required. The small hole is then sealed by holding the extreme
 point only in the <U+FB02>ame for a few minutes.
    § 7. To <U+FB01>nd total contents ofthe tube and the proportion occupied
 by the liguia'.—At a small Bunsen-<U+FB02>ame the upper part of the tube
 is dried, beginning at the top and working downwards ; then, im
 mersing in a water-bath of known atmospheric temperature, the
 scale-reading of the lower part of the capillary cup is noted. The
 liquid is then shaken to the other end of the tube and a similar
 reading noted, taken by applying the ivory scale. Halfway
 between these is the middle point. Add to this the distance
 between this middle point and the zero of scale, the sum is the
 value of zero of scale, to which we haye to add the scale-reading
 of an observation, and half the depth of the capillary cup is taken
 by estimation as the volume to be added to reading of bottom of
 ‘cup, which is always a very distinct line by transmitted light.
    Next shake a small part of the liquid into the conical top;
 then dry, and take readings. Thus, and by allowing for capil
 lary cup, we obtain the contents of half the tube, and thence
 that of the liquid with great exactness. By further operations
 of the same kind we may discover any tapering of the tube.
 This was slight, and omitted in the reductions.
     § 8. Graduating the tube t/zerm0meters.—The liquid em
ployed for these thermometers was burnt. linseed oil. After
-the tubes were marked with scale divisions and sealed, they
 were subjected for an hour to a temperature of 350° before gra
 duation.    Three were constructed (the least of them is shown
 in <U+FB01>g. 3, lashed with copper wire to the water-tube). In the
 top of the funnel F, fig. 1, a large test-tube was <U+FB01>xed and <U+FB01>lled
 with lard.    In this bath the standard mercurial thermometer,

                  of Waler at Ifig/0 Temperatures.             121'
 <U+FB01>g. 7, and an oil-tube were placed. The heating took place by
 means of two-Bunsen-burners placed below, as shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.
 At the top of each Bunsen-tube there was <U+FB01>xed a spiral wire
  (<U+FB01>g. 5), which effectually prevented the <U+FB02>ame from jumping
 downwards when at its lowest. With these and a lever with
 graduated are applied to_ the gas-cock s, <U+FB01>g. 1, the temperature
  could be gradually raised and held in command if the day was
  calm. In repeating such experiments it would be well to have
 agas-cock made specially,_so as to be able to regulate the supply
 by uniform motion.                              '
    In the lard-bath the convection currents were very rapid, and
 the temperature throughout nearly the same. The standard
 thermometer was kept moving up and down for some time
 before making the comparison (which requires a perfectly steady
 temperature to be maintained).
    The value of the scale-readings of the oil-tubes were thus
 determined, and their curves of expansion drawn to a large scale
 up to about 280°. Beyond this the curve was carried on the
 hypothesis that it was an arc of a hyperbola, which from pre
 vious experience I had found to answer well as an empirical
 curve in liquid expansion.
    §9. Another method was employed to measure the higher‘
 temperatures of the last water-tube. A tube thermometer con
 taining a 5%-inch column of sulphuric acid was prepared. The
 value of its scale-readings above 210° depended on a very good
 observation in acid-bath at 203° (the temperature having re
mained steady for half an hour). To this and the reading at
 atmospheric temperature the formula derived from the law of
expansion was applied, and the value of the higher scale-read
ings computed. It was then lashed to the oil thermometer, and
simultaneous readings taken on both up to 350°. On comparing
results, it was found that 330’ by the acid-tube was 343° by the
oil. This corresponds to the highest observation of the last water
tube. A comparison was <U+FB01>nally made with acid-tube and standard
in acid-bath at 270°, but this did not help to a nearer accordance.
    § 10. Granting that the higher temperatures are uncertain
and doubtful in their exact position on the scale of temperature,
the method of curves generally employed will cause the diver
gence to be gradual, so that the law of expansion, if it existed,
would not by this cause be masked.
    § 11. Sulphuric acid has little more than half the expansibi
lity of oil, but has the advantage of being colourless and easier
managed. Glycerine was not employed, although it may be the
best liquid upon the whole, being only one-<U+FB01>fth less expansible
than oil. In using oil-tube thermometers it is not proper to
regard observations under 100°.

122                Mr. J. J. Waterston on the Expansion
    § 12. Made ofconducting the obs-ervati0ns.—The <U+FB01>gures 1, 2, 3,
and 4 (Pl. II.) show the arrangements adopted. The heater, C C,
is a thin brass tube 2 inches diameter and 27 inches long, held
vertical over Bunsen-<U+FB02>ames by screws as shown in <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2.
To a length of 8% inches down from the top two slits were cut
one inch wide and exactly opposite. To these were applied slips
of plate glass (G G, <U+FB01>g. 2). One inch lower down a plate of
talc was <U+FB01>xed to intercept the upward current of heated air
from the lower part and direct it upon the upper end of the tubes.
An inspection of <U+FB01>gs. 2, 3, and 4 will show the size and position
of this plate, without which the observations would have been
impracticable.
    The tubes of oil and water 0, W were suspended as shown,
having a small cork stuck on at the lower end of the water-tube.
The additional glasses on the slit near which the tubes hung were
required to prevent loss of heat by radiation. A lens was used in
reading the position of the bottom line of the capillary cup of the
 liquid on the scale. It is a very distinct object by transmitted light.
     The only way to avoid the di<U+FB01>iculty caused by corrosion of
 the glass, is to make the preliminary arrangement so that a single
 series of observations shall complete the range of temperature in
 as short a time as possible without expecting a second from the
 same tube. The temperature must always be kept ascending,‘
 and is regulated by the stopcock (s, <U+FB01>g. 1), which ought to be
 made, if possible, so that the angular motion should increase
 the <U+FB02>ame at a uniform rate. The readings are taken when,
although the temperature is still ascending, it is going very slow.
The gas-cock is then touched slightly to increase the <U+FB02>ame a little,
then another observation, and so on. A windy day is to be avoided.
     § 13. The following series was completed in less than an hour;
the tubes in situ are shown in <U+FB01>g. 3, and the top surface of liquids
 -at the beginning and end are marked at ,8 and e. The glass of
 the water-tube appeared but slightly acted on, and there was no
 sensible absorption when afterwards examined. No liquid had
 collected in the top cone, and the highest observation was quite
 distinct and unexceptionable.

      The value of zero of scale is 6'36, and '04 is half the depth
  of capillary cup, so that 6'4 added to each ordinate gives abso
  lute liquid volume at each 10° of the air thermometer. The
   reading at 4°, the point of unit or minimum volume, is 0'89, to
  which adding 6'4 gives 7'29, the absolute liquid volume at
_ 4°. If there was no correction required for expansion of glass
  and the density of vapour in the upper part of the tube, the

  '04.-7, [-Ir] being at the rate of 5~(‘)~0th per 100°, which has been as

  to water at 4° and call this 3/, then                         is the true

from the strong dotted line instead of the faint dotted line, the
points in <U+FB01>g. 10 would have ranged exactly in a straight line, as
theory requires. The difference this involves in the curve of
observations (<U+FB01>g. 8) would hardly be sensible.
   § 16. Such accordance is indeed much greater than at <U+FB01>rst
sight might be expected from the observations, which in <U+FB01>g. 8
are plotted in the rough from the note-book.            But the method

                   of Water at High Temperatures.               125
 of drawing the curve through them by means of a <U+FB02>exible straight
 edge held in one position for the whole length accounts for this.
 If the law of continuity is maintained, the true line must be one
 of a similar kind with regular curvature ; and if not exactly coin
 cident with this, must intersect it with <U+FB01>at loops of very limited
 divergence, or be nearly parallel to it, because the straight edge
 is <U+FB01>xed from end to end of the range of points, and is assisted
 by the observations quoted in the previous paper; one of which,
 viz. that at 200° is computed backwards, and marked off on
 <U+FB01>g. 8. In this <U+FB01>gure a faint dotted line has been drawn below
 the one now discussed. It coincides with certain of the obser
 vations, which, from some recurring cause (connected with the
 increasing of the temperature by steps), appear on a lower level
 than the others. I have carefully analysed this curve in the
 same way as the <U+FB01>rst, and <U+FB01>nd the projection of the points in
 <U+FB01>g. 10 is‘ so close to those given that it would only confuse to
 add them.                                                   1
     § 17. The question now occurs, what is the value of - given
 by the line AA ? (see § 2 in original paper on Liquid Expansion,
 Phil. Mag. June 1861.)
    The general equation that expresses the law is vP1 = /C To
<U+FB01>nd -y, we produce AA to meet the axis of temperature, which it
does at 389°. This therefore is the value of y indicated by these
observations. The value of k, which is equal to -y—t when v= 1,
must not be taken from the temperature 4° at which the volume
of water is unity, because the curve of expansion departs from
the theoretical curve at the lower part of its range. We must
compute it from a scale-reading of an ordinate of the line A, as
                                dz)”; and since     dim -1 and

   What is the value of l required by the theory that connects
                           P
the expansion of a liquid with the density of its saturated vapour ?
By referring to § 3 of original paper, the rule is that h X 1 is a
constant quantity F (French measures) for all bodies; and refer
ring to the value of h derived from M. Regnault’s observations
given in Appendix I. to paper in Phil. Mag. March 1858, we
<U+FB01>nd the theoretical value of % =3'21.
    § 18. The results hitherto have been with temperatures by the

126             Mr. J. J. Waterston on the Expansion
curve of the acid tube thermometer produced. I have drawn
similar curves with the temperatures by the curve of the oil tube
thermometer produced, and have projected the results on <U+FB01>g. 10,
the points being shown by crosses and the straight line B B drawn
through them. We have here a similar <U+FB02>at ogee range, and the
          1                                            .     . .
value of — that comes out by a process of computation similar to
the above? is 2'69.     The mean is 3'14, which is remarkably close
to 3'21.
   § 19. That the deviation of the acid-tube curve should be so
nearly the same as that of the oil-tube and in the opposite
direction, is a curious coincidence if the true line really lies, as it
appears to do, halfway between A A and B B. While suspecting
that there may be a latent cause for this (though each curve was
as carefully determined as if the results depended on it alone), it
cannot of course be said that 1 has been fully brought out.
                             .   .  P                    .
There may be a deviation in its value corresponding to the
deviation in expansion that undoubtedly exists from about 185°
downwards.
   §20. With the view of obtaining further evidence on this
point, I have examined by the differential process (detailed in
§ 27) the results of three series of observations of three of those
tubes <U+FB01>rst experimented upon in which the temperature was
                                                  1
carried up to from 260° to 280°. Assuming f—)=3'21, the values
of y obtained by computing severalof the values of lg) at the higher
temperatures accord with 4116, varying from 400° to 430°.
The thermometers employed with these water-tubes were linseed
oil tubes, but different from the last (represented in <U+FB01>g. 3), and
somewhat longer and wider.
   §21. To arrive at the probably true value of the highest
temperature observed, we may divide the difference 12°'3 (be
tween the scale of acid- and oil-tubes) in the ratio of the values
of 1. Thus 3-59-2-e9=0-90, and 3-so-3-21=0-as; so
    P
'90 : '38 : : 12°'3 : 5°'2, which, added to 320°, gives 325°'2 C.A.
as the temperature at which the volume is 15363.         We have to
draw the curve 123'“: ——k—— throu b this       oint touchin   or cut

terms so as to make the theoretical curve touch the parabola
which answers so exactly between 50° and 150°, we <U+FB01>nd that
contact is impossible. This shows that there is a gradual rise

                          of Water at High Temperatures.                             127’

 differences, the de<U+FB02>ection from theory commences about 210°;
 and taking 1'18 as the volume at this temperature, and draw
 ing the curve (by computation) through this and the preceding
observation at 325'2, we <U+FB01>nd y=411'6, k=342'8, and

    These differences, it will be observed, increase regularly from
 190° downwards. We have here presented to us the e<U+FB01>ect of the
abnormal cause which constrains the molecules of water and
raises them to a greater volume than they would assume at the

128            Mr. J. J. Waterston on the Expansion
respective temperatures if they had retained the character of a per
fect liquid. Do the numbers in this column indicate any quan
titative law of divergence ? This has been tested by tabulating the
differences of these numbers in column 5, and the reciprocals of
these differences in column 6. These reciprocals have been laid
off as ordinates to the temperatures in <U+FB01>g. 13 (Pl. IV.). It will
be observed that the points range in the straight line s s nearly.
This line meets the axis of temperature at —47°'8. Let w repre
sent a number in column 4 at temperature t. The values of         are
                                                              dt
given in column 5, and of %) in column 6.        Fig. 13 represents
 dt
%0:(t+4-7'8).        If this were a governing law, we should have
w c; log (l+47'8), which affords the numerical equation
                     ¢{1og‘ ‘$38 ='0555—w,
in which log c=8‘94037. The numbers in column 7 have been
computed from this equation: on comparing them with those in
column 4, it will be remarked that it exactly represents the curve
of observed expansion below 100°, but that above that the ob
served volumes gradually depart from it and enter the curve of
normal liquid expansion at about 190°. The curve of column 7
crosses the normal at 159°, and at this temperature the observed
volume is 0036 above the point of intersection, an amount
which represents 3°.
    § 23. It may be that the equation for column 7 is only to be
 considered as empirical; yet it may be remarked that if it ex
 presses a physical law, that law is very simple, and has reference
 to a limiting temperature, as do also the laws of saturated vapour
 and normal expansion. The equation git?) oc(t+47'8) means
 that the absoluteincrement of divergence from the normal liquid
 volume increases with a descending temperature in the inverse
 ratio to the distance of that temperature from the limiting point
 -47'8. The normal law of expansion is, that the proportionate
 increment of volume at a given temperature increases in the
 inverse ratio of the distance of that temperature from the upper
 limit ¢y=4l1°'6.
    § 24. Since the law of liquid expansion has all the appearance
 now of being general, and assumes the character of the quanti
 tative exponent of perfect liquidity, it may be as well, before con
 cluding this paper, to describe the method of projecting on a.
 general chart the line which represents both the vapour and
liquid condition of a body throughout its range of temperature.

the value of the proportionate increment of volume of cyanogen
at 1, would be the same as the proportionate increment of water
at I, and so on; if it is double or half, the proportionate incre
ment is double or one-half. If g l=Q L, the gaseous density of
cyanogen vapour at t1 is equal to the gaseous density of Water
vapour at I; that is to say, their absolute densities bear the same
ratio to each other as their vapours do when in wguilibrio of
pressure and temperature at 15° separated from their liquids.

130             Mr. J. J. Waterston on the Expansion
    If ql is one-half QL, the density is -6-';th, being the sixth
power of one-half.
    The proportionate increment of vapour-density for 1 degree is
represented by the reciprocal of G L, because 45 =           Thus,
                                                  A    t—g
suppose lq=L Q, but g l= lGr L, the proportionate increment of
density in the vapour represented by the line g l for rise of 1° is
 double that of the vapour represented by GL, although their
 densities are equal.
     § 25. The simplicity of the relation between the-proportionate
 increments of density in the vapour and in the liquid is note
 worthy. In the vapour the proportionate increment of density
 is fig ; in the liquid it is       1   1.  A numerical example will
                                (v _1) P_          1
 illustrate this.    Let g=0° and 7=10O°, and F =3, and sup
 pose t=50°.        The proportionate increment of vapour-density
             6
 for 1° is F, or eighteen times that of the liquid ; the <U+FB01>rst being
  fgths, and the second being -1-}6th.       When they are equal,
  —f-)('y—t)=tt-—~_g), or t=94°'8.    Thus, to <U+FB01>nd the point when
  these proportionate increments are equal, the rule is to divide
                 6
  ('y—_g) by       +1)and take the quotient from ry.
      It is remarkable that in alcohol and ether this corresponds
  very exactly with the point of transition. Is the temperature of
  this point always to be thus found? If so, what is the transition
  point of water? ry—_g=489, %+1=20'26; so24(fZ6 = 24, and

To <U+FB01>nd t,d,, we multiply gt,=246-5 by 1 =2'7'58, and set off
the product 685 from the vertical scale of the chart as the length

   Densities deduced from high tensions are generally less than
the true, in consequence of deviation from Mariotte’s law, the

On this account the vapour-tensions taken below the boiling
point are to be preferred in <U+FB01>xing the direction of the chart line.
   § 27'. To <U+FB01>nd the upper terminal 7 of the chloroform line, we
have M. Pierre’s observations (Ann. de Chim. October 1851,
p. 208) to apply to the equation ('y—t) ,1?= 1%, in which y is the
unknown quantity. This equation is adapted to a series of dila
tation observations with small range of temperature. It is to be
noted that those taken below the atmospheric temperature are
to be avoided as generally faulty (see <U+FB01>gures appended to former
paper on Expansion).

it is practicable. They are supplementary to speci<U+FB01>c gravity and
boiling-point; and when tabulated both numerically and gra
phically, would perhaps carry us a step further on the road that
connects the physical with the chemical.
    The description of a body with regard to its quantitative phy
 sical characteristics embraces :—(1) speci<U+FB01>c gravity, (2) boiling
point, (3) constants of its chart line, (4) constitution of a
gaseous volume in volumes or fractional parts of a volume of its
constituents: [e. g. HOl=9, which at once exhibits its chemical
constitution and speci<U+FB01>c gravity in the gaseous or vaporous form;
so also HH"N‘l=8'5 (ammonia), OS*=32 (sulphurous acid),
Ol’lS‘l=4O (sulphuric acid), OlN=22 (protoxide of nitrogen),
 O5N’l=15 (binoxide of nitrogen), &c.
    A fractional index to a symbol as showing that in the act of
 chemical union what was a single molecule has separated into
 two or more, is demanded by the dynamical theory ofgases ; and
 we cannot have a distinct idea of the potential nature of the
 dynamic convulsion or evolution of a dynamic integral that
 accompanies chemical union without keeping both the symbolic
letters and their indices united in idea. No other indices can
be substituted; for although others may de<U+FB01>ne the chemical
constitution, they do not de<U+FB01>ne the molecular constitution,
which involves the antecedent separation as well as consequent
union.
    M-M. Deville and Troost have by heat alone separated S into
 Si’; we are therefore justi<U+FB01>ed in entertaining the idea of the ulti
mate molecule as an integral part of a gas or vapour being
 capable of subdivision. How far this may go, it would be im
 proper to limit, as the forces at the command of the chemist are
 so insigni<U+FB01>cant in comparison to the heat and pressure with
which the elements of matter have to contend in the body of the
sun or even below the surface of our planet. But it is daily
.becoming Inore manifest that the elementary molecule, although
minute beyond conception, is to be studied as a microcosm essen

 IN the article numbered 14 of these notices, I have given a
        description of an aérolitc that fell on March 28, 1860, at a
 place called in the description Kheragur, and which I have
 asuined to be an erroneous spelling of the word Dhenagur. I
 have to thank Dr. Forbes Watson and Mr. Walker for the infor
 mation that there is a place called Khiragurh, some 28 miles
 south-east of Bhurtpoor, lat. 26° 56' 30", long. 77° 53'. Khira
 gurh therefore is without doubt the locality of the fall, and repre
 sents the orthography of its name. I trust it may not be long
 before I may be able to add some facts about the circumstances
 associated with so recent an event.

                           21. Manegaum.
   The fall of an aérolite at a place variously spelt as Manegaon,
Manjegaon, Manicgaon, and Manegaum, in the collectoratelof
Khandeish in India, on the 16th ofJuly, I843, has long been on
record. For the account of the occurrence we are indebted to a
communication from Captain J. Abbott, of the Bengal Artillery,
made to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1844. (Proceedings of
that Society for 1844, p. 880.)
   The points of interest connected with the descent of this aero
lite are as follows :—It fell only <U+FB01>fty paces from two inhabitants
of the village of Manegaum, a place “on the banks of the 1'iver
Pourna,” and therefore not to be confounded (as I have in a pre
vious article confounded it) with Mallygaum, the town on the
great Bombay and Agra road, nor yet with Menjergaum, the
only place with a similar name known to the authorities at the
East India Office, and which is 130 miles south-west of Eidulabad.
This small village would seem to be a place of insigni<U+FB01>cant
importance, on the con<U+FB01>nes of Khandeish and to the west of
Eidulabad.
    The two villagers describe the fall as having been witnessed
 by them. There had been several claps of thunder with light
ning some two hours previously, and the northern heavens were
 heavily charged with clouds; but no rain had fallen for eight
 days before, 1101' did any fall for four days after the event. Their
 attention was arrested by “ several heavy claps of thunder and
lightning,” and they ran out of a shed to look round, when they
saw the aérolite fall in a slanting direction from north to south,
 “preceded by a <U+FB02>ash of lightning.” It buried itself 5 inches
in the ground, and appeared as a mass of about 15 inches long
and 5 inches in diameter.       It exhibiteda black vitreous exterior,
and was of a greyish yellow inside. At <U+FB01>rst the observers stated
it to have been (as is recorded of the Bokkeveldt aérolite) com
paratively plastic (?), and at any rate to have become more hard
and compact subsequently* ! There was only one stone seen, and
that was smashed to pieces, Another witness mentions that the
stone was at <U+FB01>rst cool, but in a short time became rather warm.
    Descriptions such as this of events so startling, so sudden and
 momentary, so entirely outside of one’s everyday experience, are
 characterized, as one would expect them to be, with a certain
 sharpness of feature and simplicity of statement that re<U+FB02>ect
 impressions vividly and indelibly stamped on the mind by phe
   * The phrase in the translation is the unintelligible one “mouldy.” It
may mean “ crumbly;” but the subsequent expression that it hardened
afterwards, implies apparently that a change came over the sohdity of
structure of the stone.

  136    Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical lV0tes.
  nomena so extraordinary. In their main features such accounts
   are no doubt true; but their truth is mixed with the exaggera
   tion due to mental excitement, and with the erroneous observa
  tion that must needs result where an almost instantaneous event
  has been witnessed, or rather where a series of events have
 ‘succeeded each other so rapidly as only to interrupt during one
  brief moment of terror and amazement the placid calm of a
  summer’s day.
     It may be doubted whether a highly educated and a scienti<U+FB01>
  cally trained person would in general relate the facts better
  (that is to say, more simply) than a poor Indian villager, whose
  graphic expressions and simple language deserve a careful
  estimate at the hands of those who would interpret them
  fairly. What is remarkable in these narratives in general is,
  their frequent concurrence upon certain points. And where
  evidence gathered in di<U+FB02>"erent latitudes, at various times, and
  from persons to whom the phenomena are entirely new, concurs
  in associating certain facts with the fall of an aérolite, we are
  bound to attach weight to that evidence, however apparently .
  inexplicable the phenomena it records may be. The sound as 0’
  thunder that precedes instead of following the aérolite whost
  motion is so much swifter than that of sound in the air in it:
  ordinary state—the appearance of a light, as of lightning falling
  from heaven, distinct from the actual mass of the aérolite itsell
  (perhaps a dissociation due only to an optical delusion)—the
  occasional coldness of the stone (so well explained by Hofrath
  Haidinger)—the extraordinary loudness of the explosions--the
  supposed alteration in the solidity of the mass after exposure to
  (damp ?) air—the frequent connexion of the fall of an aérolite with
 a derangement of the electrical condition of the atmosphere, as
 asserted by the statements which associate the fall with a thunder
 slzower, or otherwise with thunder and lightning,—these are some
 of the phenomena on which evidence has on several occasions been
 concurrent ; and assuredly the statements regarding them are the
 records offacts, though they may have to be cleared of whatever
 is the result of imperfect observation before we can see those facts
 in their true light and eliminate from them the element of the
 marvellous with which they are alloyed. Nor does the circum
 stance that the phenomena recorded as witnessed are not the
 samein the case of every aérolite, at all militate against the accu
 racy of or degree of reliance to be placed on these several records.
We have a remarkable instance of this in the association with
some cases of aérolitic falls, and the absence from others, of
explosive reports heard at the actual locality of the fall, as also
in the diversity of circumstances recorded regarding the tempe
rature of the freshly fallen mass in different cases.

        Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.        137
     The fall at Manegaum is chie<U+FB02>y interesting for the incidental
 testimony it bears in con<U+FB01>rmation of some of the phenomena
 just alluded to.
     The original softness (“mouldiness”) of the stone, and its
  supposed ultimate hardening, may perhaps have been due to a
  sort of process of setting, arising from the action of damp on the
 <U+FB02>occulent whitish mineral which seems to hold the granules of
 the aérolite together in the very loose and incompact state of
 solidity in which it exists. The native who described the cool
 ness of the stone, records also its being shivered to fragments in
  consequence of its loose state of aggregation. He spoke of it as
 at <U+FB01>rst black (previous to its being taken up? and so with only
 its crust visible 1?), afterwards blue, and <U+FB01>nally becoming white.
     Ithink, however, that both this statement and that of the
  change in solidity may perhaps be explained by the natives
  having spoken of different parts of the stone seen by them at
  diiferent times. Thus there are parts of it of a bluish grey from the
 intermixture of a black mineral in vein-like bands; while again
 the fragments that were preserved were probably those that were
 the most solid and compact—the central portions, in fact, of the
 otherwise shattered pieces—so that the crumbling of the mass in
 the hands that <U+FB01>rst raised it may have given rise_ to an idea that
 it was originally all like “mould.” Of these fragments only
 2% ozs. have been preserved, and they were in the collection of
 the Asiatic Society of Bengal at Calcutta. The specimen in the
 British Museum was one of the many liberal contributions for
 which the national collection of meteorites is indebted to that
bodTlhe. Manegaum stone is a singularly interesting one. It
belongs to the “ Howardite ” class of Rose, embracing Missing,
Bialystok, Luotolaks, and Nobleborough. I can only speak _
from my own experience of the <U+FB01>rst two of these; and of those
it is with Miissing rather than Bialystok that Manegaum pre
seats a really close similarity. It exhibits a large number of
crystalline, generally very irregularly-shaped fragments, rarely
indeed with one or two crystal planes, but generally with only
very uneven surfaces of fracture, or of imperfect cleavage.      These
crystalline grains are of a delicate primrose-yellow, passing in
some instances into a darker shade and greener hue. It is pro
bable that they are olivine, but their long resistance to the action
of hydrochloric acid makes it very desirable that their analysis
should be effected. I have found minute fragments with one
very decided cleavage, and with a second perpendicular to it pre
senting a very uneven surface; and'this, coupled with the evi
dence afforded by the directions of the planes of polarization as
seen in the microscope in favour of its being prismatic in crystal

line system, would seem to con<U+FB01>rm the view of its being olivine,
and help to show that Manegaum, like the other Howardite aero
lites, is mainly composed of that mineral. Like these other stones,
it contains this olivine ingredient in grains of some considerable
size, larger grains, indeed, than are usually met with among the
constituent minerals of aerolites.      They, however, are seen to be
present in every gradation of minuteness, and the whole are
cemented together, or rather are loosely entangled in a sort of
network of another remarkable mineral, the same probably which
Rose has hypothetically described as anorthite.
    It is, however, very unlike the anorthite as seen in the micro
scope in Juvenas, Stannern, or Jonsac, and seems by no means
a characteristic feature of aérolites which the calculations of the
chemist would proclaim to be rich in that felspar. It presents, on
the other hand, a remarkable resemblance to the opake parts of
trachytic and porphyritic rocks, such as those of the Drachenfels
and the Perlenhardt, or of the bluish Andesitic porphyry of the
Esterels. Probably the opake portions of the felspathic ingre
dients of granites, in exhibiting much similarity with these, give
a further ground for the attribution of a felspathic nature to this
substance.
    It is a remarkably opake, white or yellowish-white mineral,
and occurs as an ingredient in a considerable number of aéro
lites. Sometimes as a tlocculent or curdy network, sometimes
in opake round spherules, and often, too, in irregular pieces that
 look like fragments of these last, or, again, deposited along
laminae in crystals of other minerals, it appears to be a very com
mon though a sparsely distributed ingredient of every different
variety of aerolite.     In Manegaum (and even to a greater degree
in Missing) it rises into a somewhat important constituent of
the aérolite—-which indeed consists almost exclusively of the
olivine-like substance I have described, with some of this <U+FB02>occu
lent mineral. There is present also meteoric pyrites (or, as we
 must now call it since Hoirath Haidinger’s recent interesting
 notice, Tro'2'lite*) in a small amount; and a mineral which
 seems certainly to be chromite forms veins or reticulations and
 little dark bands here and there, in which its opake and crystal
 line particles are sprinkled, as it were, through the other ingre
 dients, and which imparts to these portions of the stone the bluish
 cast to which allusion has been already made. The crust is
 ofa very rich brownish black, and is tolerably thick, but devoid
 of the lustre peculiar to what may be called the “ enamel” on the
 Eukrite aérolites. No iron is perceptible in the small pieces I
 have had the opportunity ofexamining; but a negative argument
of this kind would be a very fallacious one, as I have found
      * Sitzungsber. der Akad. der Wissensch. Wien, March 1863.

      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.                  139
evidences of the presence of this substance in aérolites that do
not on a <U+FB01>rst scrutiny appear to contain it.
    There seems also to be in Manegaum a very small amount of
a transparent colourless crystalline mineral; but whether it is a
distinct substance from the olivine-like ingredient, I am not
able at present to say. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the aérolite is
 about 3'22.                             '
     A remark or two may not be out of place here in respect to
the aérolites that are ascribed to the l-lowardite class of Rose.
     The only two besides Manegaum that I have had the oppor
 tunity as yet of scrutinizing present very important differences.
The Bialystok stone contains, to an amount by no means insig
ni<U+FB01>cant, very distinct crystals of what I have little hesitation in
pronouncing to be an augite. It is a dark brown mineral with its
planes of polarization oblique to the crystal and to a well-marked
 striation indicative of cleavage, and presenting a decided and
interesting similarity to the augite of Juvenas, Jonsac, Peters
 burg, &c.*
     The other observation I have to make is, that -the Howardite
 kind of aérolite is not sui generis.          ln several aérolites belong
 ing to other classes, one meets with nodules and sphcrules, often
 of considerable size, of aérolitic matter belonging strictly to this
 “ Howardite” kind.            It is seen in Richmond, and forms a con
 siderable ingredient in Petersburg.             It occurs also in Benares,
 Marion County, and Nanjernoy; a11d I have met with it in a
 large nodule from the stone of Quenggouk, and otherwise disse
 minated in that aérolite ; and this list will doubtless be consider
 ably extended.
     A fact. like this may serve to warn us against the endeavour
  to separate by too sharp lines of demarcation the different groups
 into which a <U+FB01>rst inspection of their lithological characteristics
 might induce us to divide the various aérolites in our collections.
     * Since the text was in the press, I have had an opportunity, through
 the civility of Prof. Shepard, of inspecting a small fragment of the Noble
  borough stone. It is a curious aerolite. More like Bialystok than Mits
  sing or Manegaum, it is rich in a very black and opake substance (probably
  two such substances, one of which is) like the dark augite in the Eukritic
  aiirolites, and especially in J uvenas. There is much of a colourless mineral
  as well as of olivine, of every tint from pale yellow to yellowish brown; and
 the opake white mineral above alluded to is abundant. There is also a
  small amount of iron, and of what seems to be tro'1'lite.       The crust is an
 enamel with <U+FB01>ne lustre. The transparent colourless mineral may possibly
 be a felspar (anorthite '2), but it requires further scrutiny.

   XVII. On the E<U+FB02>ects of Nocturnal Radiation within the Tropics.
          By Professor MARCET, of the Academy of Geneva*.
   IT is now a recognized fact, that about the period of sunset
         and during a great part of the night, provided the sky be
   clear and the atmosphere calm, the temperature of the stratum
   of air in immediate contact with the earth is lower by 2° or 3°
   Cent. than the temperature of the atmosphere at an altitude of
   a few feet. The observations relative to the cold produced by
   nocturnal radiation, on which the above data are founded, have
  hitherto been con<U+FB01>ned to the temperate climates of Europe;
  they have never, to my knowledge, been repeated in the warmer
  atmosphere of the torrid zone. I therefore thought it expedient
  to take advantage of a residence of my son during several months
  in Australia, district of Peak Downs, Queensland (latitude 22°
  south), to obtain from him a series of observations on the effects
  of nocturnal radiation similar to those which I had myself made
  at different periods in the neighbourhood of Geneva 1', and which
  have more recently been repeated by Professor Martens at Mont
  pellieri. With this view I sent him, with the necessary instruc
  tions, a couple of carefully graduated Centigrade thermometers,
  in which the tenth part of a degree could be easily distinguished.
  My impression, I own, was that the phenomenon of a nocturnal
  increase of temperature at a few feet above the ground would, in
 all probability, be more apparent in a very hot country situated
  within the tropics than in the more temperate climates of
  Europe, both on account of the greater transparency of the
  atmosphere and because, as the surface of the earth receives
 during the day a far greater quantity of caloric, it appeared
 natural to infer that the nocturnal radiationwould be propor
 tionably greater. It was therefore with considerable surprise
 that, on examining the observations made by my son at his sta
 tion on Peak Downs in March and April 1862, I found my con
jecture to be completely erroneous. According to these obser
 vations, the increase of temperature of the air between 5 and 6
 feet above the ground, compared to that of the stratum at about
 an inch and a half above the surface of the earth, appears to be
 so slight as to be frequently barely appreciable, generally not ex
 ceeding from O°'1 to O°'2 Cent., and only in one instance reach
ing O°'4.<. And this was the case under circumstances reckoned
most favourable to nocturnal radiation, the nights being gene
rally splendid, and the sky almost always perfectly clear.

   On the E_[fects of Nocturnal Radiation within the Tropics.           1441
    This apparent anomaly, if correctly stated, as I have every.
  reason to believe, can hardly be attributed to a decrease in the
  quantity of radiant heat with which the earth parts at the mo
  ment of sunset; for the amount of nocturnal radiation being
  mainly dependent on the quantity of caloric that the earth has
  acquired during the day, must obviously, caeteris paribus, be
  greater in the torrid zone than in the more temperate regions
  of Europe. It may, however, I think, he explained by taking
  into account the following circumstances. First, the heat of the
  sun’s rays within the tropics is probably su<U+FB02>iciently intense to
  warm not only the surface of the earth, but to penetrate to a
  certain depth below the surface. The consequence is, that after
  sunset, when the earth begins to cool rapidly by nocturnal radia
  tion, the heat that has penetrated into the interior is gradually
  brought back to the surface, and thus contributes to prevent the
  cooling of the stratum of air in immediate contact with it. The
  second circumstance, and probably that which tends most to
  prevent nocturnal radiation producing the same effects as with
  us, depends, I think, on the greater quantity of water which
' must exist in the atmosphere, under the form of elastic vapour,
  in a country where the mean temperature is so much higher than
  it is in Europe. Professor Tyndall’s recent experiments have
  shown to what extent aqueous vapour is capable of intercepting
  the passage of radiant heat, since he has calculated that even in
  England, in ordinary clear weather, the tenth part of the heat
  radiated by the earth into space is arrested at a distance of
  less than ten feet fi'om its surface. In the tropical regions, par
  ticularly those which are at no very great distance from the sea*,
  the quantity of aqueous vapour which the atmosphere can take
  up and maintain in the elastic form must be far more consider
  able, and consequently the decrease in the earth’s radiation ren
  dered still more apparent.
     The following fact tends to corroborate, to a certain extent,
  the results my son obtained in Queensland. My friend M.
  Lucien De la Rive undertook last year, at my request, to make a
  few observations on the effects of the cold produced by nocturnal
  radiation in the plains of Egypt bordering on the Nile. Un
  luckily circumstances prevented their being made with regularity,
  the weather not always being favourable, and M. De la Rive’s
  stay in Egypt having been shorter than he had intended. But
  he made a su<U+FB02>icient number to be able to inform me that the
  differences of tempei'atui'e he observed about sunset, between the
  stratum of air in contact with the earth and that of the atmo
    * My son's station in the neighbourhood of Peak Downs was not much
  above a hundred miles in a direct line from the sea, and in the neighbour
  hood of lsaac’s River.

i 142                  Mr. G. Gore on the Adhesion
  sphere a few feet above it, were decidedly less considerable than
  what had been ascertained by M. Martens and myself to be the
  case in France and Switzerland under similar circumstances. I
  was, at the time I received this communication, totally unaware
  of the still more striking differences my son has since found to
  exist in Queensland.
      It may perhaps be alleged that the explanation I have ven
  tured to offer can hardly be reconciled with the striking and often
  dangerous contrast travellers in the great African deserts have
  observed between the oppressive heat of the day and the sudden
  cold which occurs immediately after sunset. The objection, I
  think, may be answered as follows :—In the vast deserts of
  Africa, the almost complete absence of water of any kind tends
  to maintain the atmosphere in a state of comparative absolute dry
  ness; for although it is true that the quantity of aqueous vapour
  the atmosphere can take up depends mainly on its temperature,
   still water must be present; and if there be none, orhardly any,
  the air, however warm, can no longer take up a sufficient quan
  tity of vapour to intercept any considerable proportion of the
  heat radiated by the earth.      Under these circumstances, there is
  no longer any reason why the cold arising from nocturnal radia
  tion should not attain its maximum, producing a striking and
   sometimes dangerous contrast in the temperature of the sur
   rounding atmosphere the moment the sun disappears beneath
    the horizon.
       XVIII. Ezyieriments on the Adhesion of Liquids to Mercury.
                             By G. GORE, Esq.*
    IF a drop of Nordhausen sulphuric acid, about one-tenth of an
         inch in diameter, is carefully placed. by means of a glass rod
    upon the centre of a clean globule of pure mercury about 80
    grains in weight, it instantly diffuses itself in a thin <U+FB01>lm over
    the surface of the metal, and the mercury becomes <U+FB02>attened and
    exhibits vortical movements all over its surface: but if the expe
    riment is made with a strong aqueous solution of ammonia or of
    caustic potash, no such results occur; the alkaline solution con
    tracts itself into a spherical form and persistently <U+FB02>oats to the
    side of the mercury without spreading itself over the surface,
    especially if the mercurial globule weighs less than 60 grains.
        To ascertain the order in which various liquids stood with
    regard to this particular behaviour with mercury, a number of
    experiments were made. Pure mercury, contained in a clean

a small drop of liquid, as nearly as possible of uniform size, was
very carefully placed upon it, and the degree of rapidity with
which it spread and the diameter it attained repeatedly noted.
Uniformity of size of the drop was important. Liquids which
produced a <U+FB01>lm upon the mercury, such as bromine, or dissolved
the mercury, such as nitric acid, were not employed. The fol
lowing order of substances with mercury at 60° F. was obtained,
the substance <U+FB01>rst named being the one that spread most readily,
and those braced together being about equal. The experiment
was repeated several times with allied liquids, to correctly deter
mine their relative positions.

 between the behaviour of the substances at the two extremes of

     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
 1 REQUEST the favour of your inserting this additional com
        munication. It is rendered necessary by the course which
 Prof. Tyndall has followed, and by my not having, like Prof.
 Thomson, declined to take further part in personal controversy
 with him. But henceforth I must do so, as the pages of the Philo
 sophical Magazine have been already far too much occupied with
 personal matters, totally irrelevant to the question originally at
 issue—such as Prof. Tyndall’s unwarrantable and utterly erro
 neous assumption that what he pleases to consider an elaborate
 attack on himself(in ‘ Good Words’) was due to Prof. Thomson,
 and his insinuation of “reasons too long to state.”
    That question I understood to be the respective claims of Joule
 and Mayer, and to thatl have kept closely. I am happy to
 <U+FB01>nd that Prof. Tyndall (by silence) intimates a tardy acquies
 cence in the statements which Prof. Thomson and I have made,
 and which I shall condense here.
    (a) That Newton enunciated, in a complete form, the Conser
 vation of Energy in abstract dynamics.
     (b) That Davy, having experimentally proved that heat is
 motion and that its laws of communication are the same as those
 of the communication of motion, extended Newton’s principle to
 one class of molecular motions.
    (c) That Carnot supplied, among other valuable developments,
thatmost important branch of the theory, Reversible Cycles in
Thcrmo-dynamics, from which has been evolved the grand consi
deration of the dissipation of energy; but that some of his results
require modi<U+FB01>cation, as he assumed the materiality of heat.
    (d) That Séguin in 1839, and Mayer in 1842, from unwar
1-antable assumptions combined with 1)avy’s discovery, attempted
to <U+FB01>nd the mechanical equivalent of heat, but obtained very erro
 neous, although coincident, results.
    (e) That Joule experimentally proved that their method should
have given an approximately accurate result, and supplied, from
his own researches, the requisite data.
    (f) But that before Joule did so, he gave in 18-23 the almost
exact value 770 foot-pounds. [To Prof. Tyndall’s remarks on
this point I shall presently advert]
   (17) That, in 1840 and subsequent years, Joule made tremen
dous strides in the experimental proof of the generality of the
Conservation of Energy, and that it is by these experiments that

           Mr. J. P. Joule on the Dynamical Theory ofHeat.          145
the principle has been <U+FB01>nally established. [On this point I may
 remark that Joule’s early papers contain stores of most import
 ant truths, and constitute a whole province of Thermo-dynamics,
 as yet known to very few.       Some of the simplest of the results
 which they contain have gained great credit for many able natu
 ralists who have recently rediscovered them.]
     (h) That Joule was the <U+FB01>rst (in print) to apply the principle
 to organic processes and to celestial dynamics. [I may mention
 here that Prof. J. Thomson remarked the effect of tidal friction
 on the earth’s rotation as early as 1840, and stated it to the
 President of the Mathematical and Physical Section of the
 British Association on the occasion of its meeting in Glasgow in
 that year; and that his brother (Prof. W. Thomson) has taught
 it, both privately and publicly, in the Universities of Cambridge
 and Glasgow for at least twenty years]
     In our article in ‘ Good Words ’ there are a few tri<U+FB02>ing slips,
 easily explained by our absence from books when it was written ;
 but none of those that we are aware of at all impair the accuracy
 of the whole. One of these has been commented on by Prof.
 Tyndall. It consists in saying “ series of experiments” instead
of “experiment,” in describing Joule’s important numerical
 result of 1843. The former expression happens to be correct in
fact, but the latter would more justly describe Joule’s published
 account which was not before us when we wrote.
    Having mentioned no latitude, or locality, we gave the number
 772 (instead of 770 for the latitude of Manchester, or 772'5 for
 equatorial gravity), and we said that this agreed, within -51')-oth of
 difference, with the more precise result of J0ule’s later researches.
 Our effort to explain the principle to an unscienti<U+FB01>c reader would
not have been promoted by our entering on such perplexing
!IllDl1lI133.
    That we referred to Joule’s experiments with the perforated
piston, in giving the date of 1843, must be evident to every
 candid reader of the article.     I am, Gentlemen,

words in reference to M. Mayer’s letter to Dr. Tyndall, inserted
in your last Number, in which he says that be regarded the
question of priority as to the mechanical equivalent of heat as
exhausted by his communication to the Academy of Sciences in
Paris, inasmuch as I did not reply to him. That I did not so
reply to M. Mayer was not because I was unable to do so, and
is still less to be attributed to any disrespect for the celebrated
German physicist, but was simply because his communication,
being a statementof opinion contrary to mine,did not appear to call
for a rejoinder, which would probably have led to an unpro<U+FB01>table
controversy. I have found no reason to alter my own view, as
stated in myarticle in the C0mptesRena'us for I849, part 1. p. 132,
to which M. Mayer’s communication was a reply, which view is
stated as follows at p. 134:-—“Avant mes expériences, il n’y
avait aucuns faits sur lesquels on p<U+FB01>t avec certitude baser la
conclusion que la chaleur spéci<U+FB01>que d’un gaz est la meme dans
ses divers états de densité. Au contraire, l’opinion générale,
conformément aux expérienoes de MM. Dela Rive et Marcet,
était que la chaleur spéci<U+FB01>que d’un gaz varie avec la pression a
laquelle il est soumis; d’of1 il découle que la conclusion non
appuyée de M. Mayer, qui n’est pas en concordance avec les
faits connus a cettc époque, n’avait pas dd appeler l’attention
des savants.”
   In M. Mayer’s reply he remarl<s—“ M. Gay-Lussac a dé
montré qu’un gaz coulant d’un ballon dans un autre vide ct
d’une capacité égale, se refroidit dans le premier autant qu’il se
chauffe dans le second. Il s’ensuit évidemment de cette expéri
ence que la chaleur spéci<U+FB01>que d’un gaz n’est pas altérée par la
raréfaction.”
   I have not been able to consult the <U+FB01>rst volume of the Mémoires
d’Arcueil, which contains the description of Gay-Lussac’s experi
ment; but it is certain that the result of it, as stated by M.
Mayer, was not received or remembered by the scientific world,
so that M. Regnault and myself were considered by others, as
we considered ourselves, to be original inquirers on this subject.
Moreover, it may be gathered from M. Mayer’s papers that he
knew nothing of this experiment of Gay-Lussac when he wrote
his celebrated memoir of 1842. This, however, so far from
detracting from the merit of M. Mayer, must, on the contrary,
increase our admiration of his wonderful prescience. But at the
same time this merit (and Dr. Tyndall agrees with me in this
point) cannot in the smallest degree interfere with the merit of
those who either before M. Mayer, or after him, pursued the
course of strict logical deduction from facts ascertained by others
and by themselves—the method by which alone the fabric of
science is securely built.

   MY nnan S1n,—In directing my large equatoreal upon the well
known planetary nebula situated in /R 20" 56"‘ N.P.D. 101° 56'
(1862), it has revealed so marvellous a conformation of this object
that I cannot forbear to send you a drawing of it, with some descrip
tion of its appearance.    With comparatively low powers, e. g. 231
                                                            \
and 285, it appears at <U+FB01>rst sight as a vividly light-blue elliptic nebula,
with a slight prolongation of the nebula, or a very faint star, at or near
                                  L2

148                          Royal Society :—
the ends of the transverse axis. In this aspect the nebula resembles
in form the planet Saturn when the ring is seen nearly edgewise.
Attentively viewing it with higher powers, magnifying respectively
760, 1060, and 1480 times, and under the most favourable circum
stances which have presented themselves, I have discovered within the
nebula a brilliant elliptic ring, extremely well de<U+FB01>ned, and apparently
having no connexion with the surrounding nebula, which indeed has
the appearance of a gaseous or gauze-like envelope, scarcely inter
fering with the sharpness of the ring, and only diminishing somewhat
its brightness. This nebulous envelope extends a little further from
the ends of the conjugate than from the ends of the transverse axis;
indeed, it is but very faintly prolonged, and only just traceable
towards the preceding and following stars. There is a star near its
border, northwards, in the projection of the conjugate axis.
   The breadth or thickness of the ring is, unlike that of Saturn,
nearly uniform, or equal in every part, so that its form most probably
is either really elliptic, and seen by us in a line nearly perpendicular
to its plane; or, if really circular, and seen foreshortened, a section
throughout any part of it, limited by the internal and external dia
meters, must be a circle.      In other words, it will be like a circular
cylinder bent round. It could scarcely fail to bring to my mind the
annular nebula in Lyra, especially as there is a conspicuous central
star (proportionally, however, much brighter than that which is in the
 centre of that nebula), and yet the resemblance is only rudely in
 form, for this ring is much more symmetrical and more sharply de
 <U+FB01>ned, suggesting the idea of a solid galaxy of brilliant stars.
    The ring is not perfectly uniform in brightness, the south-pre
 ceding part being slightly the most vivid. The transverse axis is
 inclined to the parallel of declination about 13°. A series of micro
 metrical measures of the length and breadth of the ellipse gives a
 mean of 26"'2 for the transverse, and l6"'6 for the conjugate axis.
    The accompanying drawing has not been at all corrected by these
 measures, but is the result of several sketches made during different
 observations, and is a faithful transcript of the appearance of the
 nebula to my eye, when most favourably seen.
    The object is, as may be supposed, one of extreme di<U+FB02>iculty, re
 quiring in the highest degree the combination of light and de<U+FB01>nition
 in the telescope, and a favourable state of atmosphere,-which will
 further appear when I state that it was not until I was favoured with
an unusually <U+FB01>ne night, and had applied a power of 1480, that the
 whole of the details were brought out.
    _I confess I have been greatly impressed by the revelation of this
 most wonderful object, situated on what perhaps we may consider as
 the very con<U+FB01>nes of the accessible or recognizable part of the universe,
 a<U+FB01>"ording ground for the inference that more gorgeous systems exist
 beyond our view than any we have become acquainted with.

    “ On the Strains in the Interior of Beams.”       By George Biddell
Airy, F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
   The author states that he had long desired to possess a theory
which should enable him to compute numerically the strains on
every point in the interior of a beam or girder, but that no memoirs
or treatises had given him the least assistance. He had therefore
 constructed a theory which solves completely the problems for
which he wanted it, and which appears to admit of application at
least to all ordinary cases.                                             -

 150                         Royal Society :
    The theory contemplates forces acting in one plane.            A beam,
 therefore, is considered as a lamina in a vertical plane,_—the same
 considerations applying to every vertical lamina of which a beam
 may be conceived to he composed.                                _
    The author remarks that it is unnecessary to recognize every
 possible strain in a beam. Metallic masses are usually in a state of
 strain from circumstances occurring in their formation; but such
 strains are not the subject of the present investigation, which is
 intended to ascertain only those strains which are created by the
 weight of the beam and its loads.       The algebraical interpretation of
 this remark is, that it is not necessary to retain general solutions of
 the equations which will result from the investigation, but only such
 solutions as will satisfy the equations.                             _
    After defining the unit of force as the weight of a square unit of
 the lamina, and the measure of compression-thrust or extension-pull
 as the length of the ribbon of lamina whose breadth is the length of
 the line which is subject to the transverse action of the compression
 or tension, and whose weight is equal to that compression or tension,
 the author considers the effect of tension, &c., estimated in a direction
 inclined to the real direction of the tension, and shows that it is
 proportional to the square of the cosine of inclination. He then
 considers the effect of compounding any number of strains of
 compression or tension which may act simultaneously on the same
 part of a lamina, and shows that their compound effect may, in every
 case, be replaced by the compound effect of two forces at right
 angles to each other, the two forces being both compressions, or
 both tensions, or one compression and one tension. Succeeding
 investigations are therefore limited to two such forces.
    Proceeding then to the general theory of beams, it is remarked
that if a curve be imagined, dividing a beam into any two parts, the
further part of the beam (as estimated from the origin of coordinates)
may be considered to be sustained by the forces which act in various
directions across that curve, taken in combination with the weight of
the further part of the beam, the load upon that part, the reaction
of supports, &c. Expressing the forces in conformity with the
principles already explained, the three equations of equilibrium are
formed, in which are involved several integrals depending on the
form of the curve and on the forces. As the same equations must
apply to any adjacent curve, the author remarks that this is a proper
case for application of the Calculus of Variations ; and on making that
application, a remarkable relation is found to exist among the three
functions depending on the forces acting at one point, from which it
is immediately inferred that their algebraical expressions are the
partial differential coefficients (of the second order) of a single
function of the coordinates of the point of action. On substituting
the partial differential coe<U+FB01>icients, the integrations can be immediately
performed ; and the three equations assume a form of great simplicity,
from which the sign of integration has entirely disappeared.
   A form is then assumed for the principal function, with inde
terminate coefficients, and it is shown that some of the constants
may be eliminated by means of the three equations. But in the

The Astronomer Royal on the Strains in the Interior ofBeams. 151
actual applications it is necessary to determine some remaining
constants by considerations peculiar to each case. Now there is one
modi<U+FB01>cation of the strains whose value can be ascertained by ordinary
mechanics, namely, the horizontal part of compressive force in the
part of the beam above the neutral line, and the horizontal part of
tension force in the part of the beam below the neutral line. (These
words apply to a beam supported at both ends ; in the case of a beam
projecting from a wall, the words “compression” and “tension”
must be reversed.) By determining the corresponding expression
on the theory of this memoir, and comparing the two, the remaining
constants and the form of the function are completely determined.
From its partial di<U+FB01>'erential coe<U+FB01>icients are found the three functions
depending on the forces acting at any one point (as already men
tioned), and from these three functions are found the magnitudes of
the two principal forces of compression or tension, and the angle
which one of them makes with y, in a form admitting of numerical
calculation.
   The author then applies the theory to six cases, namely, (1) a beam
projecting from a wall; (2):: beam supported at its ends ; (3) a beam
supported at its ends and carrying a load on its center; (4) a beam
supported at its ends and carrying an excentric load; (5) a beam
strained at both ends by the connexion of other beams, in the manner
of the tubes of the Britannia Bridge ; (6) a beam strained at one end
only. Cases         and (4) require the use of discontinuous functions.
Tables are given, exhibiting the numerical magnitudes of the two
principal forces and the angle made by one of them with 3/, for
 121 points in case (I), and for 231 points in each of the other
cases.   By means of these numbers, diagrams are formed, exhibitin
in each case the directions of the lines of compression-thrust an
tension-pull in every part of the beam.
   “Photochemical Researches.—Part. V. On the Measurement of
the Chemical Action of Direct and Diffuse Sunlight.” By R. W.
Bunsen, For. M.R.S., and H. E. Roscoe, B.A.
   In one of the four communications which the authors have already
had the honour of presenting to the Royal Society on the subject
of the measurement of the chemical action of light, the attempt was
made to determine experimentally the laws regulating the distribu
tion of the chemical action of the sunlight and diffuse daylight on
the surface of the earth when the sky is perfectly unclouded and
the atmosphere clear. The methods of measurement there employed
do not, unfortunately, apply to the much more usually occurring
case of cloudy skies and hazy atmosphere. The aim of the present
communication is to describe an entirely diiferent mode of measuring
the chemical action effected at any point on the earth's surface by
the total sunlight and diffuse daylight, under the most widely vary
ing conditions of situation, climate, and state of the atmosphere.
   In spite of the various futile attempts which have been made to
register and measure the chemical action of light by means of photo
graphic tints, it still appeared possible in this way to attain the
desired end. No instruments founded on such a mode of measure
ment can yield reliable results unless we know the conditions under

 152                       Royal Society :
 which photographic surfaces of a constant degree of sensitiveness
 can be obtained, and unless the relations be determined which exist
 between the degree of tint produced, and the time and intensity of
 the light acting to e<U+FB01>'ect such a tint.
    The <U+FB01>rst point which the authors examine, is whether the photo
 graphic tints produced vary in shade in the direct ratio of the
 intensities of the acting light. Several experiments proved that no
 direct ratio between the degree of blackening and the intensities of
 the light exists. Hence it is necessary to relinquish the idea of
 employing any mode of measurement founded on the comparison of
 photographic tints of ditierent shades. The next point examined is
 whether equal shades of blackness always correspond to equal pro
  duct of theintensities of the acting light into the times of insolation.
 For the purpose of testing the truth of this proposition, an instru
 ment is employed by which photographic sensitized paper can be
 exposed for times which can be exactly measured to within small
 fractions of a second.      This instrument consists essentially of a
 pendulum vibrating about §- seconds, by whose oscillation a sheet of
 darkened mica is withdrawn from, and brought back over, a horizontal
 strip of paper prepared with chloride of silver, and <U+FB01>xed in a con
 stant position relative to the pendulum and sheet of mica. The time
 during which each point in the length of the strip is exposed is
 different, and the time of insolation for each point can be calculated
 when the length and position of the strip, and the duration and
 amplitude of the pendulum’s vibration are given. A Table exhibits
 for each millimetre in length of the strip, as measured by a scale
 attached, the time of exposure in seconds which the corresponding
 point of the strip undergoes in one vibration of the pendulum.
 These numbers require to be multiplied by n if the paper has been
 insolated for n vibrations.
    The paper iusolated whilst the pendulum is oscillating, exhibits
 throughout its length a regularly diminishing shade from dark to
 white; and the time of insolation of any point is found by reference
 to the Table.     If we wish to determine which of these shades
 corresponds to another tint produced by a separate insolation, we
 cannot make the comparison by daylight or ordinary lamp-light, as
 these lights produce considerable changes of tint in the sensitive paper.
The two shades may, however, be perfectly and safely compared by
the light of a bright soda-<U+FB02>ame; this light possesses the great
advantage of being chemically inactive, and likewise of rendering
imperceptible those slight di<U+FB01>'erences of colour which make the
comparison of two shades by the ordinary light so difficult.
    In order to compare any other photographic tint with the point of
equal shade on a strip, the latter, together with its millimetre scale,
is attached to a board, in a darkened room. The board slides in
a groove, so that it can be moved horizontally; and in front of the
paper strip a small block holds in a <U+FB01>xed position a small piece of
the tinted paper which it is desired to compare. On throwing the
light of a bright soda-<U+FB02>ame upon both surfaces it is easy, by moving
the board from side to side, to <U+FB01>nd the exact point at which the
shade of the strip is identical with that of the other tinted paper. It

      Messrs. Bunsen and Roscoe’s Photochemical Researches.           153
  is then only necessary to consult the Table in order to <U+FB01>nd the time
  in seconds during which the paper must have been exposed in order
  that it should attain the tint in question. A series of lights of known
  intensities was obtained, by allowing the sun to shine through holes of
  known size. The images thus formed fell on to a piece of prepared
  paper; and the tints produced were compared with a strip darkened
  in the pendulum-apparatus, and thus the time of exposure necessary
  to effect the shade determined.      Experiments made with intensities
  varying from 1 to 50, show that within these limits equal shades of
 blackness correspond to equal products of the intensities of the acting
  light into the times of exposure; so that the light 1 acting for the
  time 50, _produced the same degree of blackening as the light 50
 acting for the time 1.
     A method for measuring the chemical action of light by simple
  observations is then founded upon this proposition. Thus, if we
  assume as the unit of photochemical action that intensity of light
  which produces in the unit of time a given degree of shade, we have
 only to determine, on a strip of paper tinted in the pendulum
 apparatus, the point where the shade of the strip coincides with the
 given tint; the reciprocals of the times which correspond to these
 points of equal shade give the intensities of the light expressed in
 terms of the above unit.
     This method of measurement is available only-—
     I. If the phenomena of photochemical induction do not interfere
 with the blackening of the paper.
     2. If a photographic surface of a constant degree of sensitiveness
 can be prepared.
    3. If an unchangeable tint can be obtained which can be exactly
 compared with the photographic paper.
    The result of a series of experiments made by varying the number
 of the vibrations and calculating the intensity from each observation,
 showed that photochemical induction does not exert any prejudicial
effect upon the measurements.
    The question into which the authors enter at greatest length as
being the most important for determining the exactitude of the
measurements, relates to the mode of preparing a standard paper
possessing a constant degree of sensitiveness. The relative degree of
sensitiveness is determined by exposing the papers to one and the
same light for the same length of time, and then comparing their
tints with the shades of a strip prepared in the pendulum-apparatus,
<U+FB01>xed in a solution of hyposulphite of soda, and furnished with an
arbitrary scale. The in<U+FB02>uence of the strength of the nitrate-of-silver
solution upon the sensitiveness is <U+FB01>rst examined; a series of experi
ments shows that with the same homogeneously salted paper, the
sensitiveness of the <U+FB01>lm does not alter when the strength of the silver
solution varies from 8 to 10 or 12 parts of nitrate of silver to 100 of
water. Further examination showed that the time during which the
paper lies upon the surface of the silver bath may vary from 15 seconds
to 8 minutes, without any difference in the sensitiveness of the paper
being noticed; and no difference is found by the employment of
silver solutions which had been long in use and those freshly pre

154                           Royal Society.
  ared.   The papers thus silvered may be preserved'for from 12 to 15
  ours in the dark without undergoing any change in their sensitiveness.
    If the paper he allowed to <U+FB02>oat on the surface of the solution of
chloride of sodium as on that of the silver bath, the sheet after silver
ing exhibits, on drying, a very unequal degree of sensitiveness in its
various parts. If, on the contrary, the sheet be well soaked in the
salt-bath no such irregularity appears, and the sheet is of an equal
degree of sensitiveness throughout its whole surface. This fact is
determined by several extended series of experiments. The effect of
change of concentration of the salt-bath upon the sensitiveness of
the <U+FB01>lm is very great ; and, as far as the observations extend, no limit
exists beyond which an increase or a diminution of the rcentage
of salt in solution ceases to affect the sensitiveness o the <U+FB01>lm.
Hence, in order to obtain constant results it is necessary to employ
a solution of chloride of sodium of constant strength. By using
solutions of the same strength, papers of a constant degree of sensi
tiveness are obtained.
    The in<U+FB02>uence of the thickness of the paper employed is next, ex
amined. Experiment shows that di<U+FB02>'erences in the thickness of white
paper, such as is usually employed for photographic purposes, is with
out in<U+FB02>uence upon the sensitiveness of the <U+FB01>lm of chloride of silver.
    The changes in atmospheric temperature, from 3° C. to 50° C.,
and in atmospheric moisture are likewise found not to in<U+FB02>uence the
sensitiveness of the prepared paper.
    From the experimental results detailed in the communication, it
appears that by adhering to a certain mode of preparation, a standard
paper can be obtained, which at all times possesses a degree of sensi
 tiveness sufficiently constant for the purposes of exact measure
ment. In the following extract from a larger Table, the readings are
given which were made from papers prepared in three different salt
 solutions of the strengths mentioned, and silvered in a solution con
 taining 12 of nitrate of silver to 100 of water. Equality in the
 numbers in each of the columns III. and IV. denotes equality in the
readings and in the tint, and therefore equality in the sensitiveness
 of the prepared surfaces. Three sheets of paper were dipped into
 each solution.     These numbers likewise show the great degree of
accuracy with which tints can thus be compared.

     The next subject considered is the preparation of an unvarying
 tint which can be easily obtained and used as the standard of com
 parison. This is effected by grinding together 1000 parts of pure
 oxide of zinc with 1 part of pure lamp-black. A series of experi
 ments showed that a colour can thus be prepared which possesses a

                           Geological Society.                     155
constant and unalterable shade ; and this can be used as a measure
of the standard tint.
    Having proved that a standard photographic paper of constant
sensitiveness, and a standard tint of unvarying shade can be prepared,
it is only necessary to apply the proposition that equal products of
 the intensities of the light into the times of insolation e<U+FB01>"ect equal
 shades of blackness, in order to found a method of comparative
measurement of the chemical action of the total daylight. As the
Imit of measurement, the authors propose to adopt that intensity of
the light which in one second produces the standard tint of blackness
 upon the standard paper.
    When the standard paper is insolated in the pendulum-apparatus,
 a strip is obtained which is tinted with every gradation of shade
 from dark to white. If the point on this strip is determined which
 coincides in shade with a paper covered with the standard tint, we
 have only to look into the Table to obtain the time of insolation (t),
 in seconds, which is necessary to produce the shade corresponding to
 the reading on the millimetre scale. If this time of insolation were
found to be one second, the intensity of the light then acting would
 be I=l ; for any other time the intensity of the chemical rays
             1
 would be Y -
    As an example of such measurement, the authors append three
 series of observations, giving the total amount of chemically active
rays falling on a horizontal surface at Manchester in summer and
winter, made at intervals of 10 minutes throughout three separate days.
These observations are likewise graphically represented as curves,
which show maxima and minima exactly corresponding to the appear
ance and disappearance of the sun; and from them some idea may
be formed of the vast differences which occur in the intensity of the
chemical rays falling on the earth’s surface during the longest and the
shortest days.
    In conclusion the authors state that it is possible, by using the
pendulum-apparatus, to construct a portable instrument by means of
which a large number of observations can be made upon a few square
inches of paper. They reserve the description of their instrument
for a future occasion.

    The following communications were read 2-
    1. “On the Gneiss and other Azoic Rocks, and on the super
 jacent Palaozoic Formations of Bavaria and Bohemia." By Sir R.
 l. Murchison, K.C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.
    The recent important discovery by M. Giimbel of a representa
 tive, near Hof, of the Primordial Zone of the Silurian Basin of

  156                      Geological Society :—
 Prague, induced the author to obtain some further particulars re
 garding the older rocks of Bavaria and Bohemia; and a large part of
 this communication referred to the sketch map and section supplied
 to him by that gentleman.
    One of Sir Roderick's principal objects in exploring this region
 was to convince himself, if possible, of the existence of a fundamental
 gneiss of as high antiquity as the Laurentian rocks of Canada and
 Scotland, and of the truth of M. Giimbel's view of the distinction of
 the gneiss into older and younger ; but, after a survey of the whole
 district, he was unable to distinguish any order of superposition
 between its two members, the so-called younger gneiss, in one ex
 tensive tract near the Danube, dipping. according to M. Giimbel,
 under the older; and their variable strike rendered it as difficult to
judge by that character as by their dip, its direction in some places
 being at right angles to what it is in others. For the present,
 therefore, though with the greatest respect for the labours of
 M. Gumbel, he considers the gneiss-rocks to constitute one great
series, it being certain that the two varieties are not separated by
 any different intervening sediment, as in the N.W. of Scotland.
    A clear illustration of the whole ascending succession is alforded
 by the order of superposition exhibited in M. G<U+FB01>mbel's section from
Hof to Selb, a distance of about seven or eight miles. Gueiss is
there seen resting against granite, and passing up into mica.-slate
underlying concretionary, quartzose, chloritic masses. which form the
base of the Urthonschiefer. This primary clay-slate is followed by
 quartzites and black roo<U+FB01>ng-slate, in the latter of which the fossils of
the Silurian Primordial Zone of Barrande occur, and ultimately by
 other Silurian, Devonian, and Lower Carboniferous strata in conform
able succession, the latter passing conformably upwards into Mountain
Limestone, which is shown to be quite unconformable to the Upper
Carboniferous of Germany.       In the remaining north-west portion of
the section the strata are repeated in inverted succession, having
been dislocated by the intrusion of igneous rocks.
    Sir Roderick next adverted to the question of the parallelism of
the Silurian Rocks of Bohemia with those of Britain, pointing out
that the Austrian Geological Survey, whose new map he exhi
bited, had adopted, for this occasion only, the colours used by the
Geological Survey of Great Britain ; and he stated his belief that too
close a parallelism between the subformations had been attempted,
and that the parallelism of such large groups only as Lower and
Upper Silurian, as proposed by Barrande, with a possible interpo
lation of“ Middle Silurian," could be maintained.
   The author then contrasted the absence of Devonian and Lower
Carboniferous Rocks, coupled with the full development of Lower
and Upper Silurian life, in Bohemia with the fuller and unbroken
succession in Bavaria. He concluded by observing that the
conformable succession of strata in Bavaria and other tracts shows
the existence of beds which bridge over the gaps, represented
by unconformities, that occur in the British series; and pointedly
adverted to the two facts. that the enormous thickness of clay-slate
beneath the Primordial Zone, though unaltered over large areas,

The original Nature and subsequent Alteration of Mica-schist. 157
had afforded no vestiges of life, and that the transitional groups
of strata uniting two great systems had not a<U+FB01>brded in any country
a link connecting one class of animals with another.
   2. “ Notice of a Section at Moktree." By R. Lightbody, Esq.
   The lower portion of this section was stated to exhibit the
Aymestrylimestone with its characteristic honeycomb structure, and
showing at its upper limit a basin-shaped depression containing
beds of sandy clay deposited parallel to its sides, and unconformable
to the Aymestry limestone, though at a little distance from the
trough this unconformity disappears. These argillaceous beds con
tain Lower Ludlow fossils, though they overlie the Aymestry lime
stone; the author consequently proposes that the latter term should
no longer be used as a separate subdivision.    He also remarked that,
in consequence of a fault bringing the Upper and Lower Ludlow
beds against one another, without having altered their dip, many
fossils have been stated to occur in the Upper Ludlow which really
belong to the Lower.

Osmond Fisher, M.A., F.G.S.; with a Note on.the Coleoptera, by
T. V. Wollaston, Esq., F.L.S.
   Lexden is a village about a mile west of Colchester, and is situated
on a plateau on the south side of the Valley of the Colne. The
brick pit shows this tableland to consist of thick beds of gravel and
sand, resting upon the London Clay, and containing at its southern
extremity a talus of old gravel. This stratified gravel is overlain
by brick-earth and soil, and is believed by the author to be that
which elsewhere underlies the Boulder-clay; and he states that be
tween it and the brick-earth there is, in one locality, a la_ver of peat
containing bones of Eleplzas primigenius, and the remains of many
insects; the latter are considered by Mr. Wollaston to differ from
British recent species, and to indicate a warmer climate than now
obtains in the district.
   2. " On the original nature and subsequent alteration of Mica
schist." By H. C. Sorby, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   When ripples are formed whilst material is being deposited,
there is a structure generated. which the author has, in former
papers, termed " ripple-drift," and which he now described. This
structure be stated might frequently be seen in polished sections of
clay-slates, and also, in a form modi<U+FB01>ed through metamorphism, in
many mica-schists. From a consideration of the facts revealed by
an examination of those rocks, he concluded that mica-schist is of se
dimentary origin, metamorphosed after deposition. and sometimes after
the production of cleavage and other physical changes, and that the
bands of different minerals represent the planes of original deposition.

                                                             April 20, 1863.
    Sir,-—I have just read a description by M. Bahinet of an apparatus
for the statical measure of gravity, read before the Academy of
Sciences on the 9th of February, 1863. This apparatus was also
devised by me several years ago, and it was constructed at my
request in 1861 by Mr. Adie, optician, 395 Strand, London.
    Ten years ago I employed a method of determining the coe<U+FB02>icient
of the bi<U+FB01>lar-magnetometer scale, in which small weights were added
to or taken from the weight of the suspended magnet*. This
method induced me to think that the variation of the lunar attrac
tion might have some share in the result found for the effect of the
moon upon the horizontal magnetic force. A short calculation proved
   "‘ See ‘ Report on the Observatories of H. H. the Rajah of Travancore ’
(1857), a copy of which was presented to the Academy.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             159
 that the variation of the attraction should not be visible on the bi<U+FB01>lar
 magnetometer. But it was evident also that an arrangement might
 be made sufficiently sensible to show this variation; and I tried in
 1858-59, by means of native workmen, to make an apparatus in
 which the magnetic force would be replaced by a. constant torsion
 force.
    This trial did not succeed, on account of defects of workmanship,
 and I was obliged to wait till my return to Europe.
    In June 1860 I communicated the principle of the apparatus to the
 optician already named; afterwards I sent him the necessary draw
 ings, and I believe the instrument was made in the <U+FB01>rst months of
 1861.    We found, however, that the spring (like the balance-spring
 of a watch) employed under the weight acted badly, and I substituted
 a simple gold wire in the same year.
    I ought to add to this, that in the end ot'l860 I sent a. descrip
 tion of my instrument to be communicated to the Royal Society of
 Edinburgh ; that the instrument was seen in 1861 by several persons
 in Mr. Adie’s workshop; that I mentioned the apparatus and its
 principle to different persons in Paris ; and I owe to M. Henri Robert,
 the well-known watchmaker, the gold wire which he recommended.
 to me as the best for the objects of my instrument.
    I ought, before ending, to notice a difference in M. Babinet’s and
 my method of observing.
    My apparatus consists of a cubic weight suspended by two gold
 wires; three sides of the cube have mirrors attached, the planes of
 the two on opposite sides making each an angle of 93 degrees with
 the plane of the third; at single gold wire is hung from the centre of
 the lower side of the cube.    (l have also noticed the plan of <U+FB01>xing
 the wire higher, given by M. Babinet.) This wire supports a lever
 by the middle, which lever can be turned by the hollow cylinder in
 which the lever hangs without being <U+FB01>xed. On the exterior of the
cylinder there is another mirror. The instrument is adjusted in such
a way that a revolution of the cylinder (and of the lower wire) will
produce a movement of the weight of about 90 degrees; the number
of degrees less than 90 depends upon the degree of accuracy desired,
and of which the instrument is capable.
   It is evident that if W be the weight suspended and AW any
variation produced by a change of gravity, then
                            H =cotan vAv ;
                             W
where v is the angle of rotation of the weight at a given station or
time, and Au the variation of this angle at any other station or time,
tlteforce of torsion being supposed constant.
   Thus, if we make 1: near enough to 90 degrees, we may perceive
an exceedingly small variation of W.
   A small telescope furnished with a prism of glass behind the wire
in the eyepiece shows accurately the coincidence of the images
re<U+FB02>ected from the mirrors and of the wire seen directly by the eye
piece (according to the ingenious arrangement in Dr. Lamont’s
instruments); and two glass scales, one above the other, are em

ployed to determine the variations of the normal angles or of the tor
sion of the wires.
   I expect to be able by means of this instrument to determine the
height of mountains more accurately than by any other plan (the
trigonometrical excepted). I hope to be able to publish soon the
results of my experiments upon this and upon the other questions
relating to the variations of gravity.
   I beg you, Sir, to do me the honour of communicating this letter
to the Academy of Sciences.

    ELECTRIC INDUCTION IN THE PYRENEES.               EXTRACT OF A

                                               “ Gavarnie, June 28, 1863.
   “ . . . . Three nights ago I passed two days and one night on the
summit of the Pimené. 8200 feet. I went up and returned by myself
heavily laden with ri<U+FB02>e, barometers, telescope, and other instru
ments, but Laurent came up at nightfall with my sleeping-bag and
provisions.      At daybreak Laurent returned, as he is busy con
structing a grange and écurie; butI remained till after midday,
when a threatened thunder-storm sent me down.           A most singular
circumstance befel me, which I do not expect you to believe; indeed
I should not believe any one who told me the same. On leaving the
Pimené I had occasion to remount a second and somewhat lower
peak of the créte, to repeat some experiments I had made in ascend
ing.    The road lay over a snow slope; and as I approached the top,
I heard what appeared to be an excessive creaking of the straps at
my back; at least, being heavily laden and feeling the weight at my
back, this was my <U+FB01>rst thought. As I reached the top the noise
increased, and on taking the ri<U+FB02>e off". which was slung at my back,
it made such a noise as if it was trying to go off.       It was loaded,
but I knew this was impossible; still I could not help keeping it
pointed away. The noise was as if some large bee or beetle had got
down the barrels and was trying to escape. I shook the ri<U+FB02>e to
shake it out; and directly the barrels were lowered to the ground
the noise ceased, but was renewed directly I raised them.        The air
was much charged with thunder-cloud, and there had been two or
three thunder-claps; and it than <U+FB01>rst occurred to me that the pheno
menon might be connected with electricity. On raising the sympieso
meter to look at it, it produced the same noise, as also did my pole,
though neither of them so loudly as the ri<U+FB02>e. The noise much resem
bled that given off by an electric conductor when a wire is approached,
but not near enough to cause a discharge. I am convinced myself that
this was the cause, and I wish I had made more experiments; but
as soon as this occurred to me I did not care to prolong my proxi
mity to the lightning, not knowing how near it might be. and I
hastened down. As soon as I had descended a little, the noise ceased,
and I could hold up my rifle with impunity. There was no wind, and
scarcely any rain. The storm did not reach Gavarnie, but at Baréges
I hear it was very violent.”

 XXIII. On the Conducling-Power of Copper and Iron for Heat at
           dz<U+FB01>ew-ent Temperatures. By J. A. ANos'rR6M*.
 § 1. IN a paper sent to the Royal Academy on January 9, 1861,
            I described a new method of estimating the conducting
 power of metals for heat, by which method that important con
 stant is obtained in absolute values (or in values easily reducible
 into absolute measure), whereas the old methods in use give only
 relative values. In order still better to establish that the method
 is practicable, and also to obtain a <U+FB01>rst estimation of the altera
tion of conducting-power brought about by changes of tempe
rature, I have continued the experiments upon copper and iron
which I described in my <U+FB01>rst paper, having moreover varied
them by employing bars of much greater dimensions. The
question, whether or not the conducting-power of metals be a
function of the temperature, seemed to me to have a not unim
portant bearing, not alone on the theory of heat, but also on a
branch of science intimately connected therewith, viz. electricity.
This question has been variously handled by former experi
menters. Some of them, as Despretz, suppose that the value
of k (the conducting-power) is independent of the temperature,
and that the departure from the geometrical law shown in the
passage of heat through bars of lead, iron, or other bad con
doctors of heat, is chie<U+FB02>y owing to the thickness of the bar, and
the consequent difference of temperature between the different
points in one and the same transverse section (a supposition
which is in opposition to the foundation of Fourier’s theory);
whilst others, as Langberg,Wiedemann, and Franz, assume that

162         M. J. A. Angstrom on the Comlucting-Power of
k is constant for good conductors of heat, such as copper, but
variable with the temperature in the case of the other metals.
    Indeed, the question cannot be answered in the way taken by
the above-named experimenters, viz. by a determination of the
temperature at different points in a bar which is heated at one
end to a constant temperature. For, in the <U+FB01>rst place, the
observed departures from the geometrical law may be due to an
altered value of the radiating power of the surface as well as to
an alteration in the conducting-power of the bar. And in the
second place, in the case of the better conductors of heat, the
 method is too little sensitive to indicate with accuracy slight
 differences in conducting-power. We see this from the last
 experiments of Despretz, wherein he took bars of a bad con
 ductor (marble), and gave to them so great a diameter that the
 heat could only very slowly pass away along the bar, and found
 the departure from the geometrical law to be insensible, at least
 when the temperature of the bar did not exceed that of the room
 by more than 30° or 40° C.
     Lastly, it is also clear that if the proportionality between the
 conducting-power for heat and that for electricity found by
 Wiedemann and Franz is to have any theoretical importance, and
 not be a merely accidental coincidence, it will not su<U+FB02>ice for the
 metals to deport themselves similarly in regard to their conduct
 ing-powers for heat and electricity, but they must do this at all
 temperatures; that is, the coefficient of conducting-power for
  one and the same metal must be the same for heat and for elec
 tricity. Since, up to the present time, no body has been found
  which does not vary in conducting-power for electricity with
  alteration of temperature, it follows that this must also be the
  case with regard to the corresponding relation to heat.
     Having made these remarks, I go on to the experiments
  themselves.
        2. The bars which were used were 1178 millims. long and
  35 millims. thick. The distances between the holes for the
  reception of the thermometer amounted to 200 millims. ; and
  the diameter of each hole was 2 millims. in the experiments
  with the copper bar and in the <U+FB01>rst experiments with the iron
  bar. The holes in the iron bar were afterwards enlarged in
  order to permit of the use of more sensitive thermometers. The
  duration of the periods in the experiments with the copper bar
  was, with one exception, twenty-four minutes, and that in the
   experiments with the iron bar thirty-two minutes.
      The apparatus for raising and lowering the temperature was
   altered, so that cold water and vapour of water were not alter
   nately made to surround the bar in one and the same bath, but
   For each of these agents a special bath was provided. Inas

       Copper and Iran for Heat at dzferent Temperatures.             163
 much as these baths admitted of changes of position about the
 bar and alterations of distance from one another, it was possible
 thereby to heat the bar to different mean temperatures, and so
 to arrive at its conducting-power at different temperatures. In
 the part of the apparatus for generating vapour, this alteration
 was made: the vapour, after passing through the cooling appa
 ratus, was _brought back to the vessel for boiling; and so the
 generation of steam could continue for any length of time with
 out a fresh supply of water.
    In the reduction of the observations, I have followed the same
 method as in my former paper. In order to eliminate from the
 periodical variations the error which is introduced by the varia
 tion in the mean temperature of the bar, and which may be called
 the secular variation, I have combined in the calculation
                       I                      I
                 1% with 12, @353 with 13 &c.,
                                                           I
                  1' with 12:12’, 2' with 132213 &c.,
where the observations taken in periods consisting of twenty-four
 divisions are denoted by
             (1. Period) ; 1, 2, 3, . . .12, 13, 14, . . .24.
             (2. Period) = 1', 2', 3', . . . 12', 13', 14', . . .24’.
 The necessity of this was particularly manifest in the case of the
 iron bar, which, after the lapse of three hours occupied in the
experiments, had not acquired a constant value for its mean
temperature ; moreover, in experiments which last several hours,
the mean temperature must always vary somewhat on account of
 the alteration in the temperature of the room, a circumstance
which cannot be avoided.
    The thirty-two observations making up the periods for the
iron bar have not been taken together, but have been divided
into two series of sixteen each.        Out of these two series, values
have been calculated, and the mean of these calculated values
has been ultimately taken.
    With three exceptions, the calculated values in the following
Table are the results of a double series of observations in which
the thermometers had their positions changed, whereby the error
in the value of the scale due to the unequal sensitiveness of the
thermometer was eliminated. Inasmuch as each double series
of this kind consisted of at least four full periods, it follows that
the values deduced in the case of the periods divided into twenty
four divisions must be the results of at least 192 readings, and
the values deduced in the case of the iron bar must be the results
of 256 readings.

   differences, so far as is known, are very slight, at any rate within
   the range of temperatures of the foregoing observations, and inas
  much as for a rise of temperature 8' diminishes and 0 increases,
   it is evident that they must have very little influence upon the
  value of the coe<U+FB02>icient of temperature.

which was not used in the obtaining of the formula, may serve
for a further control of the correctness of observations; and the
 more so as it was made with other thermometers, and the holes

   The inequality in the value both of a and of a in these deter

ence in the chemical nature of the bars used in the two sets of
experiments. And here it should be remarked that the great
copper bar used in the experiments described in this paper was
obtained last year direct from Avesta, and consisted of Fahlun
copper ; whilst the smaller copper bars taken for the former in
vestigations were procured many years ago here in Upsala, and
whence they came I am unable to say. From analyses made
many years ago, it is moreover known that Fahlun copper con

   § 3. The values of the coei<U+FB01>cients for the heat-conducting
power of copper and iron deduced from the foregoing observations
are smaller than the coe<U+FB02>icients of those metals for electricity
have been usually found.          Since, however, the latest researches
of Matthiessen* upon copper prove that this coe<U+FB02>icient varies
considerably (from 8 to 4-2 per cent. for 100° C. according to
the purity and peculiar character of the metal), it is impossible
to say at present whether or not the coe<U+FB01>icients which have been
Obtained hold for electricity. This question can only be answered
by a direct determination of the electrical conducting-power of
both metals. In order to be rigidly accurate, it is further neces
sary to make these determinations with bars in precisely the same
state as they were in when adetermination of the heat-coe<U+FB02>icient
was made, since the act of drawing out the metal into wire might
easily bring about an alteration in the conducting-power. In
satisfying these conditions, a di<U+FB02>iculty is encountered which is
by no means small, and which relates to the thickness of the
 bars. A preliminary experiment in which the large copper and
iron bars formed parts of a so-called VVheatstone’s balance gave
 no certain result, inasmuch as the least alteration in the contact
between the bars and the other parts of the balance exercised a
great in<U+FB02>uence upon the result. I hope, however, to overcome
these di<U+FB02>iculties.

FIIHERE is a well-known geometrical construction for <U+FB01>nding
    . the centre of gravity of a plane quadrilateral, which may
be described as follows.
    Let the intersection of the two diagonals (say Q) be called the
cross-centre; the intersection of the lines bisecting the middle
points of pairs of opposite sides (say O) the mid-centre (which,
it may be observed, is the centre of gravity of the four angles
viewed as equal weights); then the centre of gravity is in the
line joining these two centres produced past the latter (the mid
centre), and at a distance from it equal to one-third of the
distance between the two centres; in a word, if G be the centre
of gravity of the quadrilateral, QOG will be in a right line, and
(JG:   1 Q0.
    Thegfrustum   of a pyramid is the nearest analogue in space to
a quadrilateral in plane, since the latter may be regarded as the
frustum of a triangle. The analogy, however, is not perfect, in
asmuch as a quadrilateral may be regarded as a frustum of either
of two triangles, but the pyramid to whicha given frustum belongs
is determinate. Hence cipriori reasonable doubts might have been
entertained as to the possibility of extending to the pyramidal
frustum the geometrical method of centering the plane quadri
lateral. The investigation subjoined dispels this doubt, and
Will be found to lead to the perfect satisfaction, under a some
what unexpected form, of the hoped for analogy.
   Let abc, a/3'y be the two triangular faces, aa, b,8, cry the edges
of the quadrilateral faces of a pyramidal frustum. Then this frus
tum may be resolved in six different ways into the sum total of
three pyramids, as shown in the annexed double triad of schemes.

 If, then, taking any one of the above schemes we draw a plane
 through the centres* of the three pyramids of which it is com
 posed, the six planes thus drawn will meet in a point, which will
 be the centre of the frustum'l'.
     Let the point in which aa, /36, 70 meet when produced be the
 origin of coordinates, and bc,B'y, caya, aba<U+FB01> be taken as the
 planes of .z', y, 2; and let 4a, 0, O; 0, 411,0; 0, 0, 40 be the co
 ordinates of a, b, c, and 4a, 0, 0 ; 0, 4/3, 0 ; O, O, 47 those of
 a, ,8, 7. Consider the <U+FB01>rst of the schemes above written.

 because, as everyone knows, the centre of a pyramid is the same
 as that of its angles regarded as of equal weight. But again,
 if we de<U+FB01>ne as the mid-centre the centre of the six angles of the
 frustum regarded as of equal weight, its coordinates will be

 and if we substitute for each of the three centres last named
 points lying respectively in a right line with them and the mid
 centre on the opposite side of the mid-centre and at distances
 from it double those of these centres themselves, these quasi
 images of the centres in question will have for their coordinates

    And a similar conclusion will apply to each of the six schemes.

   2. That if we join this cross-centre (say Q) with O the mid- -

centre of the frustum abca<U+FB02>y.

of planes ; so that all six planes intersect in a single point Q, of

shown.
    The analogy with the quadrilateral does not end here. There
is a construction* for the centre of a quadrilateral still easier
than that above cited, which may be expressed in general terms
by aid of a simple de<U+FB01>nition. Agree to understand by the
opposite to a point L on a limited line AB a point M, such that
 L and M are at equal distances from the centre of AB but on
opposite sides of it ; then we may af<U+FB01>rm that the centre of
a quadrilateral is the centre of the triangle whose apices are
the intersection of its two diagonals (i. e. the cross-centre), and
the opposites of that intersection on those two diagonals respect
ively. So now if we agree to understand by opposite points on
alimited triangle two points in a line with the centre of the tri
 angle and at equal distances from it on opposite sides, and bear
in mind that the cross-centre of a pyramidal frustum is the in
tersection of either of two distinct ternary systems of triangles
which may be called the two systems of cross-triangles1', we may
a<U+FB02>irm that the centre of a pyramidal frustum is the centre of a

opposite points was not explicitly contained in it) which, accidentally meet
ing my eye in a proof sheet of some Geometrical Notes (by an anonymous

of the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, led to the long train of re<U+FB02>ections
embodied in this aper, which but for that casual glance would never have
seen the light.    be same construction, under another and somewhat less
eligible form, is given in the ‘ Mathematician ’ (a periodical now extinct,

Academy), 1847, vol. ii. p. 292, and is therein stated by the latter gentleman
to have, “ as he believes, <U+FB01>rst appeared in the ‘ Mechanics’ Magazine,’ and
subsequently in the ‘ Lady’s Diary ’ for 1830.”
   1' From the description given previously, it will be seen that a cross
triangle of the frustum is one which has its apices at the centres of either
diagonal of any quadrilateral face and of the two edges coterminous but
not in the same face with that diagonal.

 Quarterly Journal of Mathematics; but the nature of things is ever more
 Wonderful than the imagination of men's minds, and her secrets may be

 The mid-centre will mean the centre of the eight angles a, b, c, d,

 the hyperpyramidal frustum, we may either produce the line
joining the cross-centre with the mid-centre through the latter and
 not as themselves, but as their own centres ofgravity !   Some of my readers
 may remember a signal case of a similar autometamorphism which occurred
 to myself in an algebraical inquiry, in which I was enabled to construct
 the canonical form of a six-degreed binary quantic from an analogy based
 on the same for a four-degreed one, by considering the square of a cer
 tain function which occurs in the known form as consisting of two factors,
 one the function itself, the other a function morphologically derived
 from, but happening for that particular case to coincide with the func
 tion. This parallelism is rendered more striking from the fact of 4 and 6
 being the numbers concerned in each system of analogies, those numbers
 referring to degrees in the one theory and to angular points in the other. It
 is far from improbable that they have their origin in some common principle,
 and that so in like manner the parallelism will be found to extend in general
 to any quantic of the degree 2n, and the corresponding barycentric theory
 of the <U+FB01>gure with 2n apices (n of them in one hyperplane and n in another),
which is the problem of a hyper-pyramid in space of n dimensions. The
probability of this being so is heightened by the fact of the ba.rycentric
theory admitting, as is hereafter shown, of a descriptive generalization, de
scriptive properties being (as is well known) in the closest connexion with
the theory of invariants. Much remains to be done in <U+FB01>xing the canonic forms
of the higher even-degreed quantics ; and this part of their theory may here
after be found to draw important suggestions from the hyper-geometry above
referred to, if. the supposed alliance have a foundation in fact.

  any one of the six systems of hyperplanar tetrahedrons of which
  it is the intersection, and <U+FB01>nd the centre of the hyperpyramid so
  formed. The point determined by either construction will be the
 centre of gravity of the hyperpyramidal frustum in question. And
 so on for space of any number of dimensions. It will of course
 be seen that a general theorem of determinants* is contained in the
 assertion that for space of n dimensions there will be '1r(n) quasi
 planes all intersecting in the same point, as also in the general
 relation connecting this point (the cross-centre) with the mid
 centre and centre of gravity, of each of which it is easy to assign
 the value of the coordinates in the general case.
       But returning to the case of the ordinary pyramidal frustum,
 the preceding results lead at once to an easy geometrical proof
 of the well-known analytical formula for <U+FB01>nding the centre of
 gravity of a pyramidal frustum in the case where the base and its
 opposite plane are parallel.

    But I pass on to a subject of much deeper interest.
    The geometrical constructions included in the preceding inquiry
 (such for instance as depend on the properties of centres and oppo
sites), like those which occur in the more ordinary theory of the
 triangle and pyramid, at once suggest the existence of descriptive
 propositions in which harmonic centres and harmonic opposites,
 and in general harmonic multiplications and divisions, take the
 place of the corresponding arithmetical operations.
     To make my meaning perfectly clear, let us conceive a <U+FB01>xed
plane; and by a harmonic succession of points A, B, C, D . . . in a
 line meeting the <U+FB01>xed plane1' (which we may term the plane of
    " If we agree to denote by 11, I), c ; a,B,-y, the planes aBy, byu, cuB;
 ubc, Boa, yab respectively, it may easily be shown that each quaternary
 system of planes a, II, on, 13 ; b, c, ;3, -y ; c, a, -y, N passes through a single
 point, we have thus given three points which determine a plane; the inter
 section of this plane with the line a, b, c ; vs, /3, -y is a sort of centre to the
 frustum, and must possess properties deserving closer investigation.
    1' It will of course be understood that in dealing with <U+FB01>gures lying in
 the same plane, a line of relation (viz. the intersection of the plane of rela
 tion with the plane of the <U+FB01>gures) may be substituted instead of the former
 plane, since the distances from the one and the other are in an invariable
 ratio; and so for different segments in a right line, We may substitute
 a point of relation on the line itself instead of the plane. I deal with a
 plane of relation as comprising implicitly all the subordinate cases; were it
 required to go out into space of four or a higher number of dimensions, it
 would of course become necessary to deal with hyper-planes of relation.

relation) in 0, let us understand that ABCO, BCDO, &c. form so
 many harmonic systems of points; B may be then called a har
monic centre of AC, A and C opposites to B ; also we may call AB,
BC harmonic steps of the succession, so that by multiplying a
line AB n times, or making AX equal to n times AB, we are con
structing the point X to which A will be transferred by n har
monic steps, of which AB is the <U+FB01>rst; and by n-secting a line
AX, we mean <U+FB01>nding a point B in it such that a succession of n
harmonic steps, commencing with AB, will carry A to X.
    In all this there is of course nothing new; those principles
are familiar to all geometers, and have received their fullest de
velopment at the hands of Professor Cayley. We know a priori
that the descriptive properties included in the preceding (or
similar) constructions, such, 2. g., as that the six cross-triangles
of a frustum all meet in a point, will remain true when, adopting
a <U+FB01>xed plane of relation, we substitute harmonic centres in respect
to that plane in lieu of arithmetical centres*. Or, again, we may
a<U+FB02>irm that the lines joining the harmonic centres of the opposite
edges of a tetrahedron will all intersect and harmonically bisect each
 other,,and so on. But what is further wanted, and what I will
 proceed to supply, is a <U+FB01>rm quantitative basis to this enlarged
 theory, so formed as that we shall be able in the general case to
follow step by step the reasoning used in the common theory
where the plane of relation goes off to in<U+FB01>nity, and to assign to
every point determined in the general constructions as distinctive
acharacter as it possesses in the special ones. This may be done
by the aid of very elementary considerations, which I proceed to
unfold, and which will be seen at once to bring the general or
perspective theory under the dominion of the so-called integral
calculus or calculus of continuity.
    The arithmetical centre of two points A, B is the centre of
gravity of two equal atoms at A and B; let us then so assign
the weights of the atoms A, B in the general case as to make
their centre of gravity fall on the harmonic centre: this may
evidently be done by considering their weights as proportional
to their inverse distances from the plane of relation, and accord
ingly we shall understand by the weight of an atom at any point
a quantity proportional to its inverse distance from the plane of
relation.    But, moreover, the centre of gravity of the homoge
neous line AB ought to fall at this same point, which we may if
we please consider as an inference at the limit from the same
   ' Geometers have long been familiar with the idea of the pole or har
monic centre of a triangle in respect to a line in its plane; the principles
now about to be developed will enable us to attach a precise s1gni<U+FB01>ca-
tiou to the pole or harmonic centre of every geometrical <U+FB01>gure of any form
whatever.

176             Prof. Sylvester on the Principles of
thing being true for equal atoms at distances dividing the line
into any even number of equal parts. Hence in the general ana
logical theory we must take the in<U+FB01>nitesimal intervals of our atoms
at points in harmonic succession.
   Let P, Q, R be any three such points, and let .22, .r+da',
.z*+2di:+d’.r be their respective distances from the plane of
relation; and let g be the frequency at P, i. e. a quantity pro
portional to the number of atoms which occur in a given in<U+FB01>ni
tesimal space about P ; then evidently gdw is constant, and
qd".z'+ d.z'dq=O; but by virtue of the harmonic relation between
P, Q, R, we have
                 (.2 + 2dr + d’.z') (dz) = .r(d.z' + dew),
or
                .z*d9.z'=2(d1:)Q, or — —qd = dz    —,

Moreover the weight of each atom varies as %, hence the density
of any element in a line must be taken to vary as the inverse
cube of its distance from the plane of relation.
   Let us now endeavour to obtain the law of density for any
element of a plane. Let O, 0' be any two points in the line in
        0                                                    0'
which the plane in question meets the plane of relation, and let
the plane be divided into in<U+FB01>nitesimal elements similar to P Q S R
in the <U+FB01>gure by pencils whose rays are in harmonic succession pro
ceeding from O and O’ ; then one atom belongs to every such
element, which will be the analogue of a rectangular element in
the common theory; but the area of this element, as compared
with any similar element, say P’ Q’ S’ R’ in the in<U+FB01>nite sector QOS,
varies as
                        OP.RS+OR.PQ;
where P Q, R S, by what has been last shown, vary as the square

  of the distance of the element from the plane of relation, and
  O P, 0 R vary directly as the distance; hence the frequency of
  the atoms at any element in either sector will vary as the inverse
  cube of its distance from the plane of relation, and hence this
 will he the law of frequency for elements all over the plane, and
  is irrespective of the particular positions of 0,0'; and conse
  quently, the density being proportional to the product of the
  frequency of the atoms by their atomic weights, the law of den
  sity is that it varies about any point as the inverse fourth power
  of its distance from the plane of relation. In like manner, by
  taking three points 0, 0', O" in the plane of relation and divi
  ding space into solid elements by plane bundles passing through
  00', O O", O’ O" respectively, it may be proved that the law of
  density for a solid <U+FB01>gure will be that it varies as the inverse
 fifth power of the distance from the plane of relation *.
      Atoms whose weights vary inversely as their distances from
 the plane of relation may be termed like atoms ; lines, areas, and
 solids whose elements vary in density inversely as the cubes,
 fourth powers and <U+FB01>fth powers respectively, may be termed q-u-a_
 lzform<U+FB01>gures, or <U+FB01>gures of qualiform den sity, the terms like and qua
 liform being adopted as the closest analogues to equaland uniform.
 It now becomes true, and may easily be veri<U+FB01>ed, that the centres
 of gravity of a qualzform <U+FB01>nite line, triangle, and tetrahedron are
 respectively identical with the centres of gravity of like atoms
 placed at their apices -I‘; and so every known or discoverable
     * The law of density for a solid is the inverse <U+FB01>fth power, for an area
the inverse fourth power, and for a line the inverse third power.      Here we
must stop, for a point is that which has no parts: we can speak of the law
of atomic weights at a point, but not of density, for the latter implies the
existence of elements which are wanting to the point. In a. hyper-ontolo
gical sense there would be no objection to saying that for an element of a.
point the law of density in this theory is as the inverse square, always
remembering that no such element exists.
    1' As regards the <U+FB01>nite line, these results may be very easily veri<U+FB01>ed by
the integral calculus. For the triangle, it may be made to depend in the
preceding case by drawing from the point where the direction of any side
intersects the plane of relation, rays dividing the triangle into in<U+FB01>nitesimal
portions; the centre of gravity of every one such portion will easily be
seen to be in the right line joining the harmonic centre of the intersecting

theorem whatever relating to the centre of gravity of uniform
<U+FB01>gures bounded by right lines or planes becomes immediately‘
transferable to that of qualiform <U+FB01>gures of the same kind. Thus,
to take a most simple example, since the centre of gravity of a
parallelogram is at the intersection of its diagonals, it must be
and is true that the centre of gravity of a quadrilateral whose
density at any point varies as the inverse fourth power at that
point from the line joining the intersections of its two pairs of
opposite sides, will also be at the intersection of the diagonals of
that <U+FB01>gure. I am informed by Prof. Cayley that a somewhat
analogous consideration of altered density has been employed by
our eminent friend Professor William Thomson in his theory of
images, in reference to the distribution of electricity, given in
Li0uville’s Journal.
    It is an easy inference* from what has been established coii
cerning the law of frequency, that if in the perspective of any
plane <U+FB01>gure by tinting or relief we express the degree of crowd;
a, B, -y ; u,B,y, 8 for the inverse distances of the apices from the plane of
relation, and V for the length, area, or volume, in the three cases respect
ively become expressible under the very noticeable forms
            (£55.) ,,,3v, 'i*1§_+Z¢p7v, i'L/ijjilupyav,
their moments in respect to the plane of relation being respectively
                            nBV,   00/3-yV,   0:13-ydv;
                             M
so that the mean density V is in each case a simple symmetric function of
the atomic weights of the apices (it being of course understood that the
absolute atomic weight and frequency are each taken as unity). As the
same <U+FB01>gure may be variously partitioned, and the sum of the component
areas and of their moments is unaffected by the mode of partition, the pre
ceding formulae obviously give rise to, or imply the existence of, a class of
purely geometrical theorems relating to systems of points. It may be here
observed that the moment of a qualiform <U+FB01>gure in respect to its plane of
relation represents the size, so to say, of (i. e. the number of atoms contained
in) the single molecule which, placed at the centre of gravity, will be the
statical equivalent of such <U+FB01>gure ; for if n be this number, and d the distance
of the centre from the plane of the relation, and w the weight of the <U+FB01>gure,
 .               .    .    .  1
since the atomic weight is 3-, we must have g=w, or
            n=dw= moment of w in respect to the plane of relation.
So in like manner, wherever the plane of relation is situated, two molecules
A and B, placed at two points, will be equivalent to the molecule A-l-B
placed at their centre of gravity.
   * It may here also incidentally be noticed that the area of the primitive
of any perspective projection of a <U+FB01>gure in a given plane is proportional to
the attraction exercised upon it by the object plane inde<U+FB01>nitely extended,
the force of attraction between any two elements being supposed to vary
inversely as the <U+FB01>fth power of the distance.

   iiig of any element, and proportion the tint or elevation to the
   inverse cube of its distance from the vanishing line, then any
  portion of the picture will accurately represent (and indeed if we_
  use relief, the volume or weight of such portion will be strictly pro
  portional to) the area (or its weight) of the corresponding part in
  the object plane. Supposing different object planes to be repre
  sented in perspective on the same picture plane, with libertyfor the
  position of the eye to vary,it may be shown without di<U+FB02>iculty* that
  if the absolute intensity of tint or relief for any object plane varies
  as the square of the distance of its trace upon the picture plane
  from its vanishing line, and as the <U+FB01>rst power of the distance of
  the eye from the same line, the ratio between corresponding por
  tions of object and picture will be alike for every plane.
       In the corresponding problem for right lines, the relief or tint
  of any element in the perspective of a given right line must vary
  as the inverse square of the distance from the vanishing point,
  and the absolute intensity for different lines must vary as the
  product of the distance between the trace and the vanishing
  point into the distance of the eye from that point. In bary
  centric perspective we have seen the further consideration of
  atomic weight enters, so that the density follows the law of the
  inverse fourth and third powers for planes and lines respectively *,
 instead of third and second powers as in geometrical perspec
 tive; in fact in the geometrical theory the quantities visibly
 represented correspond to the momentsf in respect to the vanish

     I have termed this a theory of barycentric perspective, because
it includes a method whereby the centre of gravity of a plane
<U+FB01>gure is retained in perspective with the centre of gravity of its
projection; by what has preceded, it appears that this may be
effected by regarding its projection, not as of uniform den
sity, but of a density following-the law of the inverse cube of
the distance. From this it follows that the distance of the per
spective position in the picture of the centre of gravity of the
 circle, the area of the ellipse (regarded as made up of in<U+FB01>nitesimal sectors
 with the centre of the projection for their common vertex) becomes

 so that the area of any ellipse in a given plane, the perspective representa

 and inversely as the cube of the tangent drawn to meet it from the ortho
 gonal projection of its centre on the vanishing line. More generally, if the
 <U+FB01>gure in the plane of projection be an ellipse with semiaxes a, b, eccentri
 city e, inclination of minor axis to vanishing line on, and distance of one of
 its foci from that line h, then calling Vt-he area of the primitive and p. the

  tangent to the two shall be parallel to the vanishing line, andfrom the foot
  of the perpendicutarilpon that line from the centre draw a tangent to the
  circle, the length of the tangent so drawn will be D; so that the area of any
  ellipse will be to the area of its perspective projection as the product of the
  square of the distance of the trace into that of the eye from the vanishing
  line is to the cube of the tangent just described,——-a very remarkable pro
  position in perspective, if new. By varying the origin of our polar coordi
  nates, as by taking it, for instance, at the centre of the projection or any
   other point, we may obtain a new class of de<U+FB01>nite integrals of known values,
   and which it might be exceedingly difficult to determine by any direct
  method. It may be added that all ellipses in the same plane will bear
   a constant ratio to their projections if those latter have a common tangent
   parallel to the vanishing line, and their centres be in another line also
   parallel to the same.

 the area of the primitive in terms of the parameters of its vanish

 of potentials in the theory of attraction has a necessary place
 also in the theory of perspective.

Analogous results may be obtained for solid <U+FB01>gures, substituting
the more general notion of homography for that of perspective,
as will more fully appear in the sequel.
   Remembering that M is the area of the primitive plane object,
it seems to result as an indirect inference from the preceding
theory, that whenever we can determine the area of an oval sec-
tion (whether the bounding curve be the whole or a part of the
curve of section) of an algebraical cone, then we can determine
the position of the centre of gravity of that oval in its own
plane by processes of differentiation only; and, mutatis mutan

by algebraical surfaces ; so that                    dy or          dz dy dz being

  XXV. On the Arti<U+FB01>cial Production ofHail, and on a new Theory
      of this Meteoric Product.        By P. J. M. SANNA-SoLA1to*.
 THE following is an extract from a memoir by Sauna-Solaro,
         read before the French Academy of Sciences in April last.
    Meteorologists and natural philosophers concur without excep
 tion in the belief that hail is formed in the atmosphere by an
 act of successive incrustation. The hailstones have hitherto
 been considered to consist of a central nucleus around which
 the several component layers are deposited; and the prevalence
 of this hypothesis has on the one hand proved an obstacle to the
 discovery of the true origin of this meteor, and on the other
 leaves unexplained several phenomena which accompany it. For
  our part, we believe that hailstones are produced, from the <U+FB01>rst,
 such, very nearly, as they are when precipitated to the earth.
 Admitting that the congelation commences externally, it becomes
 easy to explain all the peculiarities met with in their centre, and
 all the other phenomena which these meteoric products exhibit.
    The external envelope having been formed (how this takes
place will be presently shown), that portion of liquid in contact
with the crust begins to congeal, bubbles of air are disengaged
from it and converge towards the centre. From this an amount
 appears to me perfectly clear, and will become so, I think, to the reader
 with the aid of a few words of explanation.
    Let Q be a closed curve of the kind supposed l ingin a plane which will
 be treated as a constant plane of projection ; and for greater simplicity, and
in order to steady the ideas, imagine that the vanishing plane (meaning
thereby the plane passing through the eye and the vanishing line), and the
 plane of the object to be put in perspective, are retained at a constant
 distance from each other and always perpendicular to the picture plane,
and also that the height of the eye above the vanishing line is invariable.
Take any <U+FB01>xed line and point in the picture Q, and determine the equation
to the curve boundary of its primitive 0 corresponding to a given distance h
between the <U+FB01>xed point and the variable vanishing line and to a given angle
of inclination at between the <U+FB01>xed line and this variable line.       Then by
hypothesis the area of 0, say M, is known in terms of its coefficients,
which will                   .
          . be known functions                        d and <U+FB02>aky‘! are known,
                                  of at and h ; hence -GT1:
and consequently the position of the perspective of the centre of gravity of
O on the picture is known; and from this the position of that centre in its
own plane can be constructed, and therefore will have been found by aid
of algebraical and differentiation processes only, as was to be shown.
   The above explanation may be made still more distinct if we su pose
that we begin with an object 9 (the curve for which is expressed y an
equation in its most general form), wherein we have, say, u=0 and h=l ;
that from this we deduce the equation of P in the preceding investigation,
and from P pass to O as before ; then, having found the coordinates of the
perspective of the centre of gravity of O as functions of h and u, make u=O,
h=l, and pass back to the coordinates of the centre of gravity in Q, of
which the centre of gravity last named then becomes the perspective.

 of pressure results, to which the crust at length gives way. The
 shock or impulse consequent on this determines a fresh act of
 congelation and the formation of a new layer. The latter must
 consist of two distinct portions; one devoid of air-bubbles and
 consequently transparent, the other opake by reason of the
 iutermingling of such bubbles within it. The same pheno
 menon recurs in each successive congelation. If the hailstones
 fall on the ground before their congelation is complete, their
 centre may be found liquid, or contain at the same time air
 bubbles, water, and needles of ice.    These last will occur when
 the internal liquid has cooled down very slowly, for threads of
 ice are only seen in water under such circumstances. If the
 oongelation be suddenly brought about, the nucleus will have
 the whiteness of snow. If the cold which acted on the mass of
 water be very intense, the crust will be more solid and thicker:
 the internal pressure caused by the dilatation of the liquid may
 be so augmented that it will cause the bursting of the hailstones
into fragments, especially at the moment when congelation is ac
 complished. Hence it can be understood why hailstones fall
 in a pyramidal form. '
     I have frozen water in different quantities in perfectly trans
parent caoutchouc capsules, and have obtained arti<U+FB01>cially all these
phenomena. Between the natural and the arti<U+FB01>cial hailstones
there is no di<U+FB01>erence except in the number of layers, which for
 equal dimensions is greater in the latter. This proves that the
 cold which produces the natural hailstones is much more intense
than that,:viz. —17° C., by the aid of which I have formed them
arti<U+FB01>cially.   It is true indeed that, other conditions remaining
the same, the number of layers decrease if the portion of water
sought to be congealed be strongly agitated; but in that case
the opake zones present a <U+FB01>brous or radiated structure. In my
experiments I have compared arti<U+FB01>cial hailstones with natural
ones of equal dimensions which did not present this structure,
and have always found the number of zones greater in the arti
<U+FB01>cial. Besides, it is evident that the congelation of the crust
must take place almost instantaneously, for otherwise we should
never meet with ether than small hailstones. But in arti<U+FB01>cial
congelation more or less time is needed to obtain an envelope
of ice capable of containing the unfrozen water; and therefore
it follows that the cold which seizes on the collections of water
in the atmosphere must, as we have said, be much greater than
— 17° C.
    In arti<U+FB01>cial congelation a phenomenon transpires which eluci
dates a similar occurrence which often accompanies the forma
tion of bail. After the liquid has remained in the freezing
mixture for a few minutes, slight cracking or detonating noises

 186'   M. Sanna-Solaro on the Arti<U+FB01>cial Production-of Hail.
are heard. These are due to the effort produced by the dilata
 tion of the enclosed water, which more or less violently distends
 and ruptures the envelope formed by each successive congelation.
 If the icy capsule be not sufficiently thick and compact, these
noises are but slightly heard, or not perceived at all by the ob
server. This is why this circumstance does not always accom
pany the meteoric product; for to render it appreciable, the icy
crusts of the hailstones must be compact, and consequently also
produced by a very intense degree of cold. We are of opinion
that the cold required for this object must at times be from 30°
to 40° C. below zero. No causes of cold hitherto recognized
are capable of producing so low a temperature as that just
spoken of ; and further, supposing that they could produce it,
the refrigeration could not be instantaneous. In the theory
proposed, we have to account for two circumstances: the <U+FB01>rst,
how the liquid masses to be transformed into hailstones are
formed in the atmosphere; the second, how the cold is produced
that attacks these collections of <U+FB02>uid and more or less rapidly
freezes their surface to a certain depth. We explain the former
circumstance by the reaction of electricity on a cloud at the
moment of its discharge from it, and the latter by the sudden
expansion which ensues on the reaction.
 7 To make this explanation clear, we assume a storm-cloud to
be charged with electricity, then at the instant that this <U+FB02>uid has
reached its maximum tension it must escape or be discharged.
In the act of escape it exercises a violent reaction on the cloud,
which compels a portion of its vapour to assume a liquid form.
But, on the other hand, as this reaction has produced a conden
sation in the cloud in which that vapour <U+FB02>oated, this air, in order
to regain its previous volume, rushes instantaneously into the
void caused by the electric discharge, and consequently undergoes
expansion to an equal degree with the preceding condensation.
Thus-the liquid masses are subjected to rapid evaporation, and
thereby to a loss of heat, more or less considerable in amount,
and hence the congelation of the surface to a greater or less
depth. When the cold is not su<U+FB01>iciently intense to freeze the
masses of water, these fall in a liquid state; and we have in this
fact an explanation why the <U+FB01>rst rain-drops of a thunder-storm
are commonly the largest in size, and why such a prodigious
rainfall often ensues immediately after a thunder-clap. Let us
see how far these statements are borne out by recorded facts.
    M. Beudant, speaking of a hail-storm observed by him in
-1838, says, “There was a clap of thunder, and almost immedi
ately the number of hailstones was greatly augmented” (Comptes
-Rendus, vol. vi.). M. Elie de Beaumont, speaking of hail upon
which he made observations in 1837, says, “ Three thunder-claps

   Action of       in arresting the Motions of Camphor on Water. 187
   of moderate violence occurred during the hail-storm,each of which
   was attended by a redoubled fall of hailstones” (ibid. vol. iv.).
   Tessicr, in his ‘ Notes on the Locality in France ravaged by the
   Hail-storm of 1788,’ remarks, “ the hail followed immediately
_ after the lightning and thunder” (Mémoires del’/1caa,'e'mie, 1789).
   We might cite many other facts in illustration ; some others are
   quoted in the memoir from which this extract is derived, but
   those already referred to su<U+FB01>ice to show that hail is in all proba
   bility formed at the moment of the electric discharge from the
   storm-cloud.
      This theory does not require the supposition of the presence
   of two clouds, which frequently does not happen. It is not ne
   cessary to suppose the existence of two contrary winds, which
   often is not met with. Again, it is not necessary to suppose the
   storm-clouds to be at a very great elevation. On the contrary,
   this hypothesis furnishes an explanation why hail falls in these
   climates during the summer and at the hottest portions of the
   day; it is because at such periods, when the air is most dry, the
   electric tension becomes more considerable than in strata of air
   of a higher elevation, and at hours of the day when the tempe
   rature is less.
      In <U+FB01>ne, the former of the two portions of this theory is not
  hypothetical but a demonstrable fact; whilst, as to its latter por
  tion, it may be remarked that if it be indisputable that hailstones
  are almost instantaneous in their formation, their cause also
  must be equally instantaneous, and there is no other cause than
  the one suggested which can operate in such a manner.
  XXVI. On the Action of Oils in arresting the Motions of Camphor
      on Water. By CHARLES TOMLINSON, Lecturer on Physical
      Science, Kin_q’s College School, London*.
  AMONG the numerous physicists who have studied the
           motions of camphor on water, from the time of Volta in
  1787 to that of Dutrochet in 1842, no one doubted or quali<U+FB01>ed
  the statement that if the surface of the water be touched with oil
  the motions are instantly arrested. Thus Volta says, “ If the
  water be de<U+FB01>led with any foreign substance, or its surface only
  slightly fouled with oily matter, if only the dust of the room be
  upon it, the looked-for motions of camphor and of benzoin will
  not take place, or will be so feeble as to be scarcely sensible.”
     In a paper read before the Royal Society about eighteen months
  ago-|-, one of my conclusions was, that an essential oil may arrest
                  * Communicated by the Author.        _

188          Mr. (.3. Tomlinson on the Action qf Oils in
the camphor-motions only during its solution and evaporation,
and that when got rid. of by those processes the motions will set
in as before. This remark was not meant to apply to all the
essential oils ,- and some results that I have lately obtained de<U+FB01>ne
the conditions of the limitation.
   A <U+FB02>at glass dish, 6 inches in diameter, made chemically clean,
was nearly <U+FB01>lled with clean water, and some fragments of cani
phor from a freshly-cut surface were scraped upon the water with
the point of a penknife-blade. The fragments rotated with great
vigour. A drop of “recti<U+FB01>ed spirits of turpentine” was gently
delivered to the surface of the water from the end of a glass rod;
the turpentine <U+FB02>ashed out into a <U+FB01>lm, and the camphor frag
ments were struck motionless——c0mme foudroyées, as Prcvost
has it, or “ as if by magic,” according to Venturi’s remark.
Fresh fragments of camphor were thrown on the surface at in
tervals during thirty hours, but no motion was produced.
   Camphor was set spinning in a similar clean vessel, and a drop
of oil of rosemary was placed on the surface; the <U+FB01>lm instantly
arrested the motions, but in about forty minutes fresh fragments
rotated briskly.
   The experiment was repeated several times with different oils,
&c., with similar results: the oils were cajeput, patchouli, car
raway, cubebs, eucalyptus, and some others, as also creosote and
carbolic acid. This additional fact was noticed with respect to
the oily <U+FB01>lms of carraway and cubebs—that fresh camphor frag
ments rotated briskly in them. It was also found that a drop
of the _oil of bitter almonds or of aniseed does not arrest the
motions of the camphor fragments at all.
   I may here remark that oil of aniseed is well adapted to ex
plain what seems to me to be the true cause of the camphor
motions, namely that a <U+FB01>lm is detached from the camphor itself
by the adhesion of the water, which <U+FB01>lm, reacting on the frag
ment, produces motion after the manner of the electrical star,
Barker’s mill, &c.      The oil of aniseed becomes solid so readily
at a moderate degree of cold, that fragments of it may be used
to show rotations on water after the manner of camphor. In the
case of camphor, the motions are very rapid, and the <U+FB01>lm that
produces them is, under ordinary circumstances, invisible;
whereas in the case of solid aniseed these rotations are slow and
the <U+FB01>lm visible, so that the action can be studied under the great
advantage of having all the conditions at command.          The <U+FB01>lm
fi'om the fragment of aniseed is pushed forward in one direction,
while the fragment itself moves in the opposite direction; and
this continues until the adhesion of the surface is satis<U+FB01>ed, and
then the motions are brought to an end. If the <U+FB01>lm, as fast as
it is formed, is got rid of by solution and evaporation, as in the

             arresting the Motions of Camphor on Water.        189
 case of camphor, the motions go on until the whole of the solid
 is disposed of. If the surface he touched with an oil or any
 substance that spreads out into a <U+FB01>lm so as to prevent the cam
 phor <U+FB01>lm from forming, the rotations cease. A little <U+FB02>our from
 the point of a penknife will spread out over the surface and stop
 the motions. Oils do this very effectually; and it was supposed,
 up to the date of my essay, that any kind of oil would perma
 nently arrest the camphor~motions.      My experiments led me to
 the conclusion that volatile oils that leave no residue, arrested
 the motions only during their solution and evaporation. I now
 go much further, and show that certain oils do not arrest the
 camphor-motions at all, and that in such cases the camphor <U+FB01>lm
 has a stronger adhesion to the surface of the water than that of
 the oils in question.
    The reason why the <U+FB01>xed oils stop these motions is, that they
 form permanent <U+FB01>lms, displacing the camphor <U+FB01>lm, and prevent
 ing its adhesion to the water. Volatile oils such as turpentine,
 contain products of oxidation which are neither soluble nor vola
 tile; and these arrange themselves in the form of a delicate per
 manent network over the surface of the water, and effectually
prevent the adhesion of the camphor fragments. Such products
 of oxidation can, however, be got rid of by distillation. For
 this purpose about an ounce of turpentine was distilled from off
 caustic potash ; and when a drop of the distillate was placed on
 the water among the rotating fragments, the resulting <U+FB01>lm dis
 placed them for a moment, but did not stop the rotation. On
 the contrary, they immediately invaded the oily-looking <U+FB01>lm,
skating in and through and about it, and leaving long trails free
from oil behind.
    This, then, is a case in which the camphor <U+FB01>lm has a stronger
adhesion for the water than the camphene <U+FB01>lm has. A large
number of oils, isomeric with oil of turpentine, and reputed com
mercially pure, were tried, but they all more or less stopped the
rotation of the fragments. On rectifying them by distillation,
they either did not arrest the motions at all, or those motions set
in again as soon as the <U+FB01>lm had evaporated.
    Oil of bitter almonds is not liable to be acted upon by the air
in the same manner as the turpentine oils; it partly evaporates
and partly forms benzoic acid, which is one of the gyrating sub
stances. It is, moreover, displaced by the camphor <U+FB01>lm ; hence
it does not arrest the camphor-motions. The same remark applies
to Persian naphtha, belmontine, Young’s para<U+FB01>lne oil, some spe
cimens of rock-oil (recti<U+FB01>ed) from Canada and Newfoundland.
One specimen, of a deep yellow colour, arrested rotation ; it was
distilled, and the distillate had no retarding effect.
   In order to stop the camphor-motions, the oily <U+FB01>lm, whether

 190 Dr. ,G.' Quincke on the Position of the Oscillations of the
 visible or not, must cover the whole surface of the water.                      If
 the point of a pin be dipped into turpentine and,theu into the
  water in the 6-inch vessel, the fragments will be repelled, but
  will not cease to rotate except in and about the small <U+FB01>lm pro
  duced by the pin. The head of a pin dipped in turpentine pro
  duced a <U+FB01>lm large enough to cover the whole surface and arrest
 the motions.
       It was suggested to me by Professor Miller to add a minute
  quantity of resin to the <U+FB01>lm of camphene while the camphor
  fragments were moving about in it. A little powdered resin
  dusted on the surface had no other effect than that of mecha
  nically clogging the motions without arresting them; but the
  head of a pin dipped into an alcoholic solution of resin and then
  into the camphene <U+FB01>lm on the water, had the effect of stopping
  the motions of the camphor fragments.

XXVII. On the Position of the Oscillations of the 1Ether-par

       Qumcxn *.

              are perpendicular to the plane of polarization, as Fresnel
"assumed-1-, or, a Prof. Neumann maintains I, take place in the
-plane of polarization itself, is closely connected with the ques
 -tion whether the density or elasticity of the aether is different
-in different media.          Neumann arrived at the latter view, that
  the vibrations take place in the plane itself, by developing the
'theory of double refraction from the same principles as those
which -Fresnel had already established. Considering further
‘that Fresnel, in developing the laws of re<U+FB02>exion for transparent
  substances, assumes that the density of the aether is variable, but
  afterwards, in the theory of double refraction, assumes that the
  elasticity is variable, it is even doubtful for which assumption

Stokes *, Haidingerr, and Lorenzi, have decided for the <U+FB01>rst
view, MM.Babinet§, Holtzmann<U+FB02>, and Jamin1I adhere to the
latter. Cauchy**, who in his theory assumes independent par
ticles of mther, was originally for Neumann’s view, which, how-'
ever, he afterwards, in a letter to M. Libri, exchanged for Fres.
nel’s, since he could not assume that the forces which in a
normal condition are exerted in vacuo on the aether disappeared.
As far as is known to the author, Cauchy has never published
the reasons which led him to this assumption.                             ' ~
    Of the methods of experimentally deciding between the two
 assumptions, that of MM. Stokes, Holtzmann, and Lorenz, of
 deducing the direction of the vibrations from the position of
 the plane of polarization in diffracted rays, had given discordant
 results; and according to Fizeau’s newest experinients1"|- no con.
 clusion appears possible from this method.                                   '
    In like manner, Haidinger’s experiment for deciding the
 question by considering the absorption of light in crystals in its
 dependence on the position of the direction of vibration of the
 ather-particles, has led to no result; and objections might be
 raised against Babinet’s proof, who, from the position of the
 plane of polarization of light which is re<U+FB02>ected from paper
 surfaces at an extremely oblique incidence, concludes that the
 vibrations are in the plane of polarizition.                                 "
    Jamin 11, again, in an elementary proof of Cauchy’s for"

 transparent bodies, has defended Neumann’s assumption. For
 if the components of the vibrations normal to the limiting sur;
 face are constructed for the rays in each of the media vibrating
 in the plane of incidence, these, according to Jamin, must stand
 in a ratio independent of the angle of incidence. According

 192    Dr. G. Quincke on the Position of the Oscillations of the
    In the belief that the question can alone be decided by ex
 periment, the author has adopted the following way :
    From Malus’s laws of the property of luminous rays polarized
 perpendicularly to one another, and from Fresnel and Arago’s
 laws of the interference of polarized rays, it follows that the
 vibrations are perpendicular to the luminous ray itself, and
 either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of polarization.
 In a perpendicular incidence, the rays which are re<U+FB02>ected from
 any surface must have the same deportmcnt whether their vi
 brations are perpendicular or parallel to the plane of incidence.
 But if the angle of incidence increases, there is no change for
 the rays with vibrations perpendicular to the plane of inci
 dence, while for the rays whose vibrations are in that plane
 the inclination of the path of the aether-particles in reference to
 the re<U+FB02>ecting surface changes. From the elliptic polarization of
 light which is re<U+FB02>ected at the limiting surface of metals and air,
 or of glass and air, it is known that the rays with vibrations
 perpendicular, and those with vibrations parallel to the plane
 of incidence, undergo a change of phase which is different in
 each case, and that the difference of the change of phase alters
 with the angle of incidence. According to the author’s view,
 the ray with vibrations perpendicular to the plane of incidence
 would undergo the same alteration of phase for all different
 angles of incidence; while the alteration ofphase of the ray whose
 vibrations are in the plane of incidence, as follows from Jamin’s
  experiments*, would increase by a magnitude corresponding
 to half a wave-length, g, if the angle of incidence increased from
 0° to 90°. However this may be, the phase of the rays which
 Vibrate in the plane of incidence must, in any case, change to a
 greater extent with the incident angle than that of the rays
 Vibrating perpendicular to the plane of incidence; and with the
 same angle of incidence this change must be different according
to the nature of the media whose limiting surface re<U+FB02>ects the
rays. In the re<U+FB01>exion from metallic surfaces, the change of
phase, at an angle of incidence which is considerably less than
the principal incidence (in which the difference of phase of the
components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of
incidence amounts to 3), is already perceptible, but in re<U+FB01>exion
from glass it is imperceptible. If, therefore, rays re<U+FB02>ected
from the same surface, half glass and half metal, and which in
other respects are the same, could be made to interpose, the

    interference-bars for rays with vibrations perpendicular to the

    must coincide for all angles of incidence; while for rays with

   which was very slightly inclined towards the <U+FB01>rst; so that the
   rays re<U+FB02>ected from the posterior surface of the <U+FB01>rst and from
   the anterior surface of the second plate could interfere with
   the rays re<U+FB02>ected from the anterior surface of the <U+FB01>rst and
   the posterior surface of the second, as in a similar apparatus
   which Jamint has used and described.                A screen darkened
   the rays re<U+FB02>ected from both anterior or both posterior sur
  faces of the parallel glasses, and the rays transmitted by the
   screen fell upon a bisulphide-of-carbon or <U+FB02>int-glass prism,
  with a refractive angle of 60°, and a vertical refracting edge,
  in which a spectrum with thick dark interference-bars was seen
  with the naked eye. By suitably choosing the breadth of the
  slit, and altering its distance from the lens, the Fraunhofer’s
  lines could be made to be distinctly seen in, the spectrum ; and by
  a suitable adjustment of the parallel glasses, the interfeence-bars
 were made parallel to Fraunhofer’s lines in the spectrum.
       The second plane-parallel glass was covered on the lower half
  of the posterior surface with a metallic mirror, and in the spec
  trum the rays re<U+FB02>ected from glass-glass and glass-metal could be
  simultaneously seen, inasmuch as the upper part of the spectrum
 had been re<U+FB02>ected at the surface of air and the posterior surface
 of the second glass, the lower half had been re<U+FB02>ected at the limit
 of metal and the same posterior glass surface. Although both

rays polarized parallel or perpendicular to the plane of incidence the
 phase of the re<U+FB02>ected ray continually alters with the angle of incidence,
as it remains dubious whether, by altering the compensator (in positive
re<U+FB02>exion), the component polarized in the plane of incidence must be con
tinuously retarded, or the component polarized perpendicular to the plane
of incidence must be continuously accelerated, in order to nullify the dif
ference of phase of both components.

interfering rays had different intensity in the lower spectrum,
the interference-bars could be perfectly well seen, and appeared
displaced towards the interference-bars of the upper spectrum,
when looked at through a Nicol’s prism the principal section of
which was parallel to the plane of re<U+FB02>exion of the glasses, that is,
when only rays polarized parallel to the plane of re<U+FB02>exion reached
the eye. If the Nicol’s prism was turned 90°, the interference
bars in both spectra coincided, in which case luminous rays,
polarized perpendicular to the plane of re<U+FB02>exion, could alone
 reach the eye. In the latter case the intensity of light was, of
 course, feebler. In a position of Nicol’s prism in which its
 principal section is almost parallel to the plane of re<U+FB02>exion, a
 different position of the interference-bars in both spectra is seen,
 so long as the intensity of the light polarized in the plane of
 incidence predominates ; and for the same reason the phenomenon
 is seen without a Nicol’s prism, just as with a Nicol’s prism whose
 principal section is parallel to the plane of re<U+FB02>exion.
    The author used various glass plates of from 4 millims. to
 8'5 millims. in thickness, whose refractive index varied between
 1'45 and 1'5.     For metallic coating, mercury (ordinary mirror
 surface), silver, gold, and platinum were used.
    The angle of incidence q> at which the rays met the anterior
 surface of the plane-parallel glasses was varied from 20° to 60° or
 70°; yet not under all angles of incidence could the interference
 bars in the lower spectrum (glass-metal) be seen for rays pola
 rized perpendicular to the plane of incidence, on account of the
too small intensity of the light of the rays re<U+FB02>ected at the limit
of air and glass, as compared with that re<U+FB02>ected at the surface of
glass and metal. The displacement of the interference-bars
towards each other in both spectra, for rays polarized parallel to
-the plane of incidence, increased in all metals with increasing
angle ¢; yet when :9 is > 60° the phenomenon cannot be well
seen, as too much light is lost by re<U+FB02>exion at the anterior glass
surfaces. The phenomenon is best seen with an angle of inci
dence at of 45° or 60°, in which case the displacement of the
interference-bars amounted to about 0'3 or 0'4 of the distance
of the fringe.
    With an incident angle ¢=20° and less, the intensity of the
 rays re<U+FB02>ected at the limit of glass and air, and of the rays
 re<U+FB02>ected from glass and metal, is so di<U+FB02>"erent, that the author
 could not discern with certainty a displacement of the interfe
 rence-bars in both spectra towards one another; yet from his
 experiments it may be concluded that if it exists it is less than
 0'1 of the breadth of a fringe.
    It may here be observed that this apparatus, by means of a
 compensator of Soleil and Duboscq’s construction, permitted a

   determination, with plane-parallel glasses slightly inclined to
   each other, whether the ray reflected at the limit of glass and air
   was retarded towards the other.       It was seen, at least with the
   angles of incidence used by the author, that the ray re<U+FB02>ected
   from metal must always be retarded, in order to bring-the inter
   ference-bars, glass-metal, into the same position as the inter
   ference-bars, glass-glass.
      It would thus follow from these experiments, that the luminous
  rays polarized in the plane of reflexion undergo the greatest
  alterations of phase, that vibration takes place in the plane of
  polarization, in accordance with Prof. Neumann, and that the
  elasticity of the aather di<U+FB02>'e1's in ditferent media.

        HE magnitude which the ri<U+FB02>ed ordnance of the present day
          have attained, and the large charges which are consumed
  in their bores, render it an object of great interest that we should
  be able to assign the pressures on the grooves (or other driving
  surfaces intended to give rotation) due to different modes of
  ri<U+FB02>ing, as well as to determine the increment in the gaseous
  pressure arising from the nature of ri<U+FB02>ing adopted.
     The formulae, which I shall hereafter give, have, with slight
 modi<U+FB01>cations, been used at Elswick for nearly three years, and
 are now given, partly, because no investigation of the question
 has, to my knowledge, been published, and partly because, as
 several erroneous statements on the subject have appeared, the
 formulae themselves may possibly be of use to some artillerists.
     The case we shall <U+FB01>rst examine will be that in which the rota
 tion is given by means of grooves, the driving-surfaces of which
 are such that if a section of the gun, perpendicular to the axis,
 be made, the line drawn from the centre of the bore to the groove
is coincident with the section of the                 Fig 1_
driving-surface. A section of such
a form of ri<U+FB01>ing is shown in <U+FB01>g. 1.                 ‘MB

 196    Captain Noble on the Ratio between the Forces tending to
 tion, it will be more convenient to consider the projectile in its
 motion along the bore of the gun as moving on a <U+FB01>xed axis, and,
 further, to suppose that the motion of rotation is communicated
 to the projectile by a single groove. These suppositions will not
 interfere with the accuracy of our results, and will enable us
 very much to simplify the equations of motion.
    Take (<U+FB01>g. 2) as the plane of my, the plane passing through the
 commencement of the ri<U+FB01>ing at right angles to the axis of the
 gun. Let the axis of .1: pass through the groove under conside
 ration, and let the axis of z be that of the gun. Let A P be the
 helix, and let (see <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2) P(.'v,y, 2) be the point at which
 the resultant of all the pressures on the groove may be assumed
 to act, the projectile being in a given position. Let the angle
 AON=¢
    Let us now consider the forces                   Fig_ 2_
 which act upon the projectile.                     I
 We have, <U+FB01>rst, the gaseous pres
 sure acting on the base of the
 shot.    Let us call this force, the
 resultant of which acts along the
 axis of z, G.      Secondly, if R be
 the pressure between the projec
 tile and the groove at the point P,
 this pressure will be exerted nor
 mally to the surface of the groove,
 and if we denote by 7\, ,u., v the
 angles which the normal makes
 with the coordinate axes, the re
 solved parts of this force will be
    R.cos7t, R.cos//., R.cos1/.
Thirdly, if ,u, be the coefficient of
friction between the rib of the
projectile and the driving-surface,
the force ;:.,R will tend to retard the motion of the projectile.
This force will act along the tangent to the helix which the point
P describes ; and if a, 13, y be the angles which the tangent makes
with the coordinate axes, we have as the resolved portions of this
force p.,R . cos a, p.,R . cos B, ,u,,R. cos 7; and summing up these
forces, we have the forces which act

in 294 inches, the other octagonally, with a pitch of one turn in
 130 inches. It is required to determine in each case the pres

 That is, on the supposition of the same pressure on the base of
 the shot, the pressure on the driving-surface is in the latter case
 nearly <U+FB01>ve times as great as in the former, and is, in fact, no
 inconsiderable fraction of the propelling force.
    Let us now compare the gaseous pressures on the base of shot
 of the same weight supposed to be <U+FB01>red from the guns above
 described, and from a smooth-bored gun.           From equations (28)
 we have the pressure upon base of shot <U+FB01>red from
             Smooth -bored gun     .  .  .   .     = G,

    In these calculations we have taken the coefficient of friction
  =%. It is necessary, however, to observe that very little is
 known concerning the value of this constant at pressures so
 high as those with which we have here to do. It is evident
 that in the case of the contact of similar metals, when the point
 of seizure is approached, the coef<U+FB01>cient of friction cannot be con
 sidered independent of the pressure; and it is probable that
 when the rubbing surfaces of both projectile and groove (or
 other driving-surface) are of the same hard material, the coeffi
 cient of friction may be occasionally enormously increased.
    The resistance due to this cause might, under certain circum
 stances, be suf<U+FB01>cient to ensure the destruction of the gun ; and
 this view is to some extent corroborated by the occasional burst
 ing of guns, the failure of which it is dif<U+FB01>cult to attribute to any
 other cause; and in the instances referred to, the recovered
 fragments of the shot were thought to exhibit decided appear
 ances of seizure.

And this equation will represent the ratio of the pressures

     We have not in this note entered into
  the question of the absolute pressures
  existing in the bores of ordnance of
  various natures, as the subject is too
  extensive and of too great importance to
  be disposed of within the limits of a short         ,,
  paper.
     Artillerists acquainted with the subject will be able to form
  rough approximations to these pressures from the experiments
  made abroad with smooth-bored guns, with a view to the eluci
  dation of this important question. It is much to be regretted
  that no experiments of the nature referred to have been attempted
  in England under Government auspices, as they are of a descrip
 tion which precludes their being satisfactorily made by private
 individuals, and as the information to be derived from them
 would,be especially important in the case of ri<U+FB02>ed cannon, where
 so many new conditions are introduced into the problem as to
 render previous investigations of but little value.
     We shall, however, in a future note endeavour to discuss this
 subject, making use of the data at present at our disposal.

                       and Chromatic Dispersion.
 IN the differential equations (A) which express the laws of the
     motion of light in heterogeneous substances,without, however,
making any distinct assumption as to the nature of the vibra
tions, there occurs only one function, namely (0, which is directly
dependent on the heterogeneity of the medium, and can there
fore be any function whatever of .z~, y, and z. Such a function,
as is well known, can by Fourier’s theorem be represented gene
rally by the equation

 The coe<U+FB02>icients 0, e,,, &c. which occur here are constant, and 2

    Thus expressed, the function 0 or w—e IS retained with all its
 generality; but if we preserve this degree of generality, which
 comprehends every possible conglomeration of transparent sub
 stances, the integral can obviously represent only a confused
 mixture of luminous motions.           Without altering the form of
 equation (1), we will therefore introduce an essential limitation,
 by making the quantities cl, very small. On this supposition
 the formula will express a periodicity and a regularity such that
 it will rapidly repeat itself at the various points of the body.
    We shall thus obtain a <U+FB01>rst approximation by taking the quan
 tities up very small; this case is by no means the same as that
 of perfect homogeneity, but directly leads, as we shall see, to
 double refraction. _ _ _
    The components E, 17, Q can be expressed by a series of the
following form :
E: 500 +2E(iPp)C(iPp) +22é(iPpiPqlC(iPpiPq) +
 In this expression E0,      i-pp), &c. stand for constant coe<U+FB02>icients
 of the variable quantities C, C(ip,,), &c., which latter are ab
breviations of the following values,
                cos (kt—l.z'-my—nz)=C,                    _
                cos (/ct—l.z'-—my—nz+p,,) =C(+p,,),
                &c.
The double sign denotes the sum of the two expressions; and
lastly, 2 and 22 are the sum and double sum for all indices 12
and q, both of which pass through the same series of values as
index 12 in equation
    In the double sum, as well as in the subsequent terms, such
terms as have already occurred in previous terms must be con
sidered as excluded ; thus, for example, the term
                         —E(Pr ‘_Pq)C (Pp" Pa)
would be excluded when q was = 12.
    It will be understood that two quantities pp and pq, when p
and q are unequal, can be taken as different in such wise that
their sum or difference cannot become constant. On the con
trary, it is conceivable that 3, 4, . . . &c. of the quantities pp may

one another, inasmuch as they disappear by integration over a

    If the above expression, or the value of any other coe<U+FB02>icient a,

        We will now investigate specially two cases, namely those in
 which the exponents 12 have the respective values 0 and 2. It
 will then be seen that the result in both these cases agrees with
experiment, since the non-periodic portions of the excursion are
 in both cases in the same plane through the perpendicular to
the plane of the wave. Let this plane be determined by the
equation
                             Aw + By + C2 =1).
 Since it passes through the perpendicular to the plane of the
 wave and the non-periodic part of the excursion, we have
                             Au-i-Bv+Cw=O;
 and forp=O,                   _      _     _

 For p=2, we get
               z=,%€=,—§§[é0+E%"€<¢p,>]@+
 It‘, therefore, the non-periodic part of the component of the excur
 sion is here denoted by Q-‘QC, equation (4) gives
                  E0: "Sal? EQ_u(u€0+v;0+wE0)]'
By multiplying this equation by A, and forming two analogous
equations by putting in one case 1;, B, 12, and in the other §, C, w_
for E, A, u, we get by addition of all three equations,
                            AE0 + B1]o+ C§,=_O.
 Hence this excursion also lies in the plane I), which was to be
proved.                      ~
    '- It will consequently make no essential di<U+FB02>erence whether we
take p=0 or 11:2, for in both cases the plane of polarization is
the same.        In the <U+FB01>rst case the components of the excursion are
 determined by (9), and accordingly do not lie in the plane of the
wave; on the. contrary, it is easily proved that they are perpen"-I
dicular to the ray, which in doubly refracting media differs, as
is well known, from the perpendicular to the plane of the wave.
In the other case, however, p=2, we have
             50: %zo= §1él:‘?o“’u(“go+'v"_7o+wEo):l5
and this equation, in conjunction with the analogous equations

   the plane of the wave, and the result in regard also to the direc
   tion of the vibrations is now in perfect accordance with the
   common theory. Thus whether we assume p=0 or p=2, the
   plane which passes through the excursion and the perpendicular
   to the plane of the wave coincides, as in the ordinary theory, with
   the plane passing through the perpendicular to the plane of the
  wave and the corresponding ray.                                     .
      We only require to go a step further, that is, to take the higher
   powers of up into consideration as well as the lower ones, in
   order to arrive at the theory of chromatic dispersion. As already
   pointed out, the coef<U+FB01>cients a in the equations (B) admit of being
   developed according to powers of l, m, n, so that only even num
   bers of them occur as factors; hence they can also be developed
  according to powers of 5%, by introducing the values given above
  for l, m, n.   Herein lies the law of chromatic dispersion of light
  so far as it is known to us. There would be no difficulty in car
  rying out the calculation in its most general form; but, as it
  seems to me, there would be no practical interest in doing so.
  If the body is not crystalline, that is, if no one direction is dif
  ferent from the rest, the velocity s will be given by
                        Q2
                        Y2" =a1,1=ll2,a=¢s,a;
  where a,’1 admits of being developed according to even- powers
 0-; 1.
     7\.
     According to this theory, chromatic dispersion appears as a_
 property of material bodies, dependent on their periodic hetero
 geneity, whereas, on Cauchy’s theory, the absence of chromatic
 dispersion in a vacuum can only be explained by new hypotheses.
 It has already been shown by M. F. Eisenlohr (Poggendorif’s
 Annalen, vol. cix.) that, even when we retain the common con
 ception of the nature of luminous vibrations and of the aether,
the phenomena of chromatic dispersion lead to the assumption
Of periodical changes in the density of the aether in material
bodies. It also results from the present investigation, that double
refraction can likewise be deduced from this assumption, which
is in fact the most general that we can make.
    Fresnel’s supposition, that the explanation of double refraction
lies in an unequal elasticity in different directions, may perhaps
nppear to receive con<U+FB01>rmation from the fact that uncrystalline
bodies become doubly refracting by pressure. It must, however,
be likewise observed that the dimensions of the body are altered
by pressure, and that consequently the periodic constants, and
                                   P2

212                  M. Lorenz on the Theory of Light.
the homogeneity in different directions, must alter at the same
time. Thus by a vertical pressure the vertical dimension will be
diminished, and thus all the small irregularly lying layers of
which the body consists will become horizontal ; the body must
then behave like a doubly refracting crystal with one vertical
optic axis.

     In the foregoing calculations we have come upon rectilinear
 vibrations only, and we should not be able to deduce any others
 by further approximation. But, as already mentioned, the calcu
 lation presupposes that 3, 4, . . . &c. of the magnitudes pp can
 acquire no constant value by addition and subtraction. This
 possibility, as the more general case, must nevertheless neces
 sarily bc taken into consideration; and it then becomes apparent
 that the formulae thus generalized comprehend also elliptic vibra
 tions dependent on the uneven powers of the small quantities up.
     Retaining our previous notation, and likewise putting
                      S      = sin (/ct—l.'v—m_1/—nz),
                      S(p) = sin (kt—l.z‘—m_i/-nz+p),

 where the coe<U+FB02>icierits of S, S(ip,,) are denoted by accents. The
 components '17 and § may be determined in an analogous manner.

   —_§0i -_17o, —_§0 In place of .f'0, 17",, CO. For if equation (12) is

  Into C, which is the same thing as changing all the fs on the

 hence it will always be allowable to make the speci<U+FB01>ed changes
 in the derived equations.
     It can be proved further, that while the previous relations (5)

      Uneven powers only of up will occur in these coefficients ; they
   are accordingly small in comparison with the coefficients a, and
  will disappear in the <U+FB01>rst approximation (up: and hence also,
   upon our present supposition, the results of the previous section
  remain unchanged for the <U+FB01>rst approximation.
      I have carried out the calculation for the two cases of three or
  four of the quantities p,, giving a constant sum; the latter case,

  this sum is not altered by exchanging u for v, or I for m, we con
  clude, as before, that we shall have 'iz,,,=a,_ ,. In the same way

     The velocity s thus receives two notably different values in the
case of the perpendicular to the plane of the wave coinciding
with the optic axis of the crystal; for the assumed values of
u, 1), ware precisely those of the cosines of the angles which the
optic axis makes with the axes of coordinates.

the cases in which the value of the exponent p is either 0 or 2,
it makes no essential di<U+FB02>erence which of these values be taken
in applying the generalized form of Fresnel’s formula, since the

 The ray divides itself accordingly into two circularly polarized
 rays, which advance with somewhat unequal velocities. These
 latter may be deduced from (20) ; thus

                        s,,=b(1 —%uc9d—%wa‘*f),
 where s, corresponds to the upper sign in (23), and s2 to the
lower sign. In the latter case the circular polarization is right
 handed, because dl and gthen have contrary signs.

     When both rays have advanced by the distance r, the plane
of vibration has rotated through the angle

is towards the right when d and f are negative. Moreover,
                        27r
since is is equal to s        the rotation is nearly proportional to
                        T’
7-15, or to the inverse square of the wave-length.
     The transition is easy from the general case here treated to
the particular cases of optically uniaxal and isotropic bodies.
Circular polarization has been really demonstrated only in these
two cases; but the hope of detecting it in biaxal crystals also
ought not to be given up, especially since this property escaped
observation till lately in several uniaxal crystals (as chlorate of
soda, sulphate of strychnine, cinnabar, &c.).
     In nature, circular polarization appears as the exceptional case,
while in the mathematical treatment of the subject it appears as
the most general case. This results from the symmetry which
pervades all nature, whereby the constants A become nothing,

 _Mr. B. Stewart on the Radiation and Absorption of Gases.         219
 and consequently d, e, f disappear also. And even were this
 not the case, in a perfectly symmetrical arrangement these latter
 quantities would be made up of terms which would mutually dc-.
 stroy each other. Circular polarization therefore presupposes a
 want of symmetry, which in the calculation is the more general,
 in nature the rarer case.
    The conclusion to which the present investigation leads is, that
 simply by the further development of theformal side of the laws of
light, that is, the laws of refraction and re<U+FB02>exion by isotropic trans
parent bodies, without doubtful hypotheses, and in fact by keep
ing to just the most general form, it is possible to arrive at a com
plete theory of double refraction, of chromatic dispersion, and of
 circular polarization.
    A step further may still be made in the direction we have here
 entered upon, and I will brie<U+FB02>y point out how. The velocity of
 light is regarded as a function of ac, y, and z; it may, however,
 be taken still more generally as a function of the time t, for it is
plainly a limitation to suppose the particles of the body origi
nally at rest. This can be easily introduced into the calculation
 by giving to p,,' the value

 Since, however, the differential equations (A) were not formed
on this supposition, they cannot in this case be taken as a safe
basis for the calculation, and the more generally valid differen

          XXX. On the Radiation and Absorption of Gases.
                By BALFOUB Srnwiiivr, M.A., F.R.S.*
AS the relation of radiant heat to gases and vapours is at
         preent engaging the attention of two very eminent expe
rimentalists, and is also a subject of much importance in meteo
rology, the attempt, however imperfect, to discuss it from a
different point of view may not be without interest.                   ‘
   It would_appear to be established that the spectra of gases pre
serve to a great extent the same character or type through a.
considerable range of temperature. We know that this is the
case with the vapour of sodium, which consistently absorbs the
double line D; and we know also that the characteristic line of
thallium is always prominent in its spectrum, although, when
the temperature becomes very high, other but weaker lines are
added. Coupling this with the proposition which asserts that
the absorptive power of a body for any kind of heat is propor
                       "‘ Communicated by the Author.

 220     Mr. B. Stewart on the Radiation and Absorption of Gases.
 tional to its radiative power, it would seem very probable that
 for many gases and vapours a sensible or even a large proportion
 of the heat absorbed is that which corresponds to a few de<U+FB01>nite
 and disconnected wave-lengths.
     To take a particular case-—-suppose that we wished to ascertain
 the absorptive power of sodium-vapour for the heat correspond
 ing to that portion of the spectrum around the double line D.
 If the spectrum be a continuous one, we are quite certain that
 the sodium-vapour will select the two rays forming the well
 known double line, which will be absorbed with great avidity,
 while the remainder of the heat will be allowed to pass. Also a
 small quantity of sodium-vapour would be suf<U+FB01>cient to do this,
 and a large quantity would do no more. Perhaps a foot of
 vapour would absorb no more than an inch, at least sensibly no
 more. If, therefore, we wish to ascertain the absorptive power
 of sodium-vapour, we must not compare one foot of vapour with
 one inch, but one foot or one inch of vapour with a total absence
 of all vapour.                                                           ~
     The same line of reasoning must, I imagine, be extended t
all gases and vapours; nor do I think that the absorptive power
of any gas for radiant heat can be considered as determined until
the gas which is interposed as a screen between the source of
heat and the instrument which measures the radiation be com
pared with a total absence of all such gas: at any rate that
tenuity ought to be reached for which an increase of gas pro
duces an increase of absorption.
     I wou'ld next remark that there is probably a connexion, of
the precise nature of which we are ignorant, between the kind of
heat radiated by gases and vapours, and the boiling-points* of the
liquids which give rise to these.
     To make an extreme supposition, let us suppose that sodium
vapour does not radiate any heat of a lower refrangibility than
the double line D. If we suppose at the same time that heat of
this refrangibility is entirely absent in the radiation of low tem
peratures, then we cannot imagine sodium-vapour to exist at
these temperatures. If these suppositions be considered extreme,
nevertheless they suggest to the mind the probability of a con
nexion of the kind indicated above, and lead us to imagine that
gases which radiate heat of a high refrangibility belong to sub
stances which have high boiling-points.
    Now, of all known substances, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen
have the lowest boiling-points, indeed we have not yet been able
to liquefy these gases; so that, according to the above hypo
thesis, we should associate the description of heat radiated by
   "‘ The word “ boiling-point ” is here used as a single word which su<U+FB02>ici
ently represents the meaning to be conveyed.                  '

 Mr. B. Stewart on the Radiation an¢lAbsorplion of Gases.               221
these gases with that which belongs to an extremely low tempe
rature, or, in other words, with heat of a very low refrangibility
or of very great wave-length. Of course I do not imagine that
this hypothesis has been proved, but certainly think there is a
probability that some such connexion exists.
   Again, with respect to the kind of heat which is radiated and
absorbed by rock-salt, I have endeavoured* to show that this is
heat of very great wave-length. It may therefore be to some
extent the same description of heat as that which I have supposed
to be radiated and absorbed by the three permanent gases, which,
in conformity with the above hypothesis, is probably heat of great
wave-length.
    I would further remark that, in any arrangement where a
source of heat such as boiling water is used, and where the
other parts of the apparatus are at a temperature, let us say of
60° F., the heat which is operated upon is not the radiation
of 212° F., but the radiation of 212° F. minus the radiation of
60° F. Now, since the average wave-length of the radiation
diminishes as the temperature increases, it .is easily seen that the
radiation of 212° F. minus the radiation of 60° F. has a less
average wave-length than the whole radiation of 212° F. Indeed
by such an arrangement we separate from the whole body of heat
which, by Prevost’s theory, is radiated by boiling water, that
portion of it which possesses the smallest wave-length or greatest
refrangibility, and upon this heat we make our experiments.
    Let us now consider how atmospheric air is situated with
respect to an arrangement in which the source of heat is boiling
water, and the temperature of the thermo-pile 60° F., and in
which the vacuum-tube is closed with plates of rock-salt, while
it is presumed that there is absolutely no atmospheric air in the
arrangement except that which is the subject of experiment.
    1. If it be supposed that the heat which atmospheric air
radiates and absorbs is that of a very low refrangibility, it is
evident that the total radiation and absorption of such air will
be less increased by raising the temperature from 60° F. to
212° F. than those of another gas which radiates heat of a high
refrangibility-the reason of this being that the rays between
60° F. and 212° F. are of a comparatively high refrangibility,
and that atmospheric air radiates and absorbs these only to a
 small extent.
    2. Moreover, part of the radiant heat is stopped by the plate
 of rock-salt ; but it is possible that many of the rays which 1'ock
 salt stops are those which are also stopped by atmospheric air.
 The rock-salt would therefore in this case sift the radiant heat,
   ‘ Iransactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxii. part 1, p. 63.

222     Mr. B. Stewart on the Radiation and Absorption of Gases.
and reduce it to that quality which is passed without absorption
by atmospheric air.
    On the whole, therefore, if we consider the above hypothesis
as at all probable, such an arrangement cannot, I think, be
viewed as a favourable one for exhibiting the absorptive power
of atmospheric air, the effect being apparently to diminish this
property of air.
    Let us now, on the other hand, re<U+FB02>ect how the radiation of
aqueous vapour is influenced by the same arrangement. Accord
ing to hypothesis, the heat radiated and absorbed by aqueous
vapour possesses a comparatively high refrangibility. A consi
derable portion of it will therefore be included in the radiation
between 60° F. and 212° F., and this will not be stopped by
rock-salt. The effect of the arrangement will therefore be appa
rently to increase the radiation of aqueous vapour, and also of
many of those vapours which possess high boiling-points.
  " Finally, suppose that we introduce into the vacuum-tube a
mixture of air and of a vapour possessing a high boiling-point.
Here it is evident that while little or no heat will be absorbed
by the <U+FB01>rst of these substances, owing to the peculiarity of the
arrangement, a great deal will be absorbed by the second, and
the result will be that air plus vapour will appear much more
athermanous than air alone.
    Owing to these considerations, I should hesitate to conclude
that the results hitherto obtained regarding the radiative and
absorptive powers of gases and vapours afford ground for that
hypothesis which asserts that the absorptive and radiative powers
of simple bodies are less than the corresponding qualities of com
pound bodies. But, inasmuch as aqueous vapour would appear
to absorb a different description of heat from atmospheric air,
the very important meteorological conclusion deduced by Prof.
Tyndall would still appear to hold good on the present hypo
thesis; that is to say, air with vapour will probably stop more
of the heat radiated by the earth than air without vapour.
    It is even possible that there may be an additional safeguard
against the cooling of our globe by radiation into space, in the
fact that when the temperature falls very low and there is
scarcely any vapour in the air, the heat radiated is then of a de
scription which is stopped by dry air, which would thus serve as
a cloak or covering, performing the same o<U+FB02>ice as that which is
performed at a higher temperature by air loaded with aqueous
vapour.

  XXXI. Concluding Remarks on a recent Mathematical Contro
    versy. By His Honour JAMES CocKLr:, M.A., of Trinity
     College, Cambridge, F.R.A.S,F.C.P.S. $0., The Chief Justice
    of Queensland*.
       MONG mathematicians there are those who will lend but
         an academic faith to Mr. -lerrard’s assertion that he has
 succeeded in rescuing from the class of impossible problems the
 noted problem of equations. His theory is erroneous, unsup
 ported by calculations of his own, and at variance with the results
 of the calculations of others. Mr. Jerrard may regard article 4.
 of his paper of December 1862 (I refer to the date of the N umber
 of this Journal in which the paper appeared) as a sufficient
 answer to me, but I do not so consider it; and mathematicians
 will form their own opinion as to whether objections which I
 have urged against Mr. Jerrard’s analysis are not fatal to his
 theory. Mr. Cayley’s objections Mr. -Ierrard only attempts to
 answer by general observations in articles 1 and 2 of his paper,
 and by a verbal criticism in article 3,—article 2 consisting in great
 part of a repetition of a fallacious argument, the use of which leads
 me, I confess, to the conclusion that Mr. Jerrard has misappre
 hended Lagrange’s theory of similar functions. Following an ana
 logous method to that pursued by Mr. Jerrard, we might dispute
 the validity of any mathematical proposition whatever on such
grounds as these:
                     :c=.r,       .z'—.z'= (1 —l).z-=0,
and all formulae into which .n enters are illusory. If Mr. Jerrard
were toform a sextic of which the roots should be the <U+FB01>fth
powers of those of the sextic in 6 discussed by me, and veri<U+FB01>ed
by the independent processes of Mr. Harley, the sextic so formed
would (according to Mr. .1errard, I mean) depend directly on an
Abelian equation, and therefore involve in its solution quadratic
and cubic radicals only.        If Mr. Jerrard should refuse to test
his theory by forming and trying to solve the latter sextic, there
may be no impropriety in suggesting the following test. Assu
ming the coe<U+FB02>icients at his pleasure, let Mr. Jerrard construct
an irreducible quintic into a root of which an irreducible cubic
surd shall enter. That the former test will not have for its

 224     Concluding Remarks on a recent Mathematical Controversy.
 issue the solution of the sextic is manifest from the circumstance
 that the expression
                            9? i+9Z¢9§+9§9§
 is a rational function of one root only of the quintic, and conse
 quently that the root of the quintic will contain no quintic surds.
That the expression in question is such a rational function may
be inferred from the foot-note to art. 88 of my paper of March
 1860, from the third division of my “ Notes on the Higher
Algebra ” in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Mathematics,’ June 1860,
or more directly from my “Supplementary Researches in the
 Higher Algebra” in the <U+FB01>rst volume of the third series of the
 ‘Manchester Memoirs.’ Mr. Jerrard has not avoided a diffi
culty which, as he has pointed out in his paper of January 1846,
must arise; nor has he given any de<U+FB01>nite enunciation of the
theorem to which, -at least according to his paper of February
1846, that of Cauchy must yield its place. On the cover of this
Journal for November 1860 Mr. Jerrard announced that he was
preparing for the press an Appendix (to his ‘Essay ’) relating to
the mode in which cubic radicals enter into the expressions for
the roots of equations of the <U+FB01>fth degree. Until that Appendix
shall have appeared, I retire from a controversy the continuance
of which seems only to elicit from Mr. Jerrard a repetition of
refuted arguments. However much I may differ from Mr. Jer
rard on certain points, I repeat my acknowledgements of the
instruction and advantage which I have derived from the study
of his writings.

      Most meteorologists are agreed that a circumscribed area of baro
  metric depression is usually a locus of light ascending currents, and
  therefore of an indraught of surface winds which create a retrograde
  whirl (in our hemisphere), because they bring to their destination a
  lateral impulse, partly due to the greater easterly speed of the earth’s
  surface whence the southern portion of the indraught took its de
 parture, and partly due to the less easterly, or we may say greater
  westerly, speed of its northern portion.                                 _
     Conversely, we ought to admit that a similar area of barometric
 elevation is usually a locus of dense descending currents, and there.
 fore of a dispersion of a cold dry atmosphere, plunging from the
 higher regions upon the surface of the earth, which, <U+FB02>owing away
 radially on all sides, becomes at length imbued with a lateral motion
 due to the above-mentioned cause, though acting in a di<U+FB02>"erent manner
and in opposite directions. The currents necessarily travel with
diminished radial speed as they widen out from their central area of
dispersion, and the eastward tendency of the northern portion of the
system and the westward tendency of the southern become more
overpowering.       It may be presumed, on consideration of the extreme
mobili      of the air, that a continuous dispersion of currents would
result in the yielding of the east and west winds, which had no
tangential movement of their own, to the curvature of the others,
and that we should witness a disposition of currents like those in the

forming a sort of “ anticyclone.”
    Dove’s law of gyration is so fertile in result, that ,_—____,
it accounts for the same direct rotation of a cold Scale 1000 mile,
wind by a wholly different process. As an antithesis to his theory
of cyclones being due to an eguatorial current pressing against
quiescent air, he adds (Law of         torms), with a view of illugljra.
ting his position, and not of meeting cases that practically occur,
polar cyclones, “if they exist,” would have a direct rotation.
It is not necessary to allude further to his well-known theory-—it is
su<U+FB02>icient to show that two separate causes cooperate in producing a
rotation or curvature of currents such as I have described. I have
not the slightest doubt that a strong curvature of atmospheric cur
rents to the right does frequently exist, owing to the descent of cold
air from above; for in lately charting the weather of Europe thrice
daily during a month, I found it more or less present on from <U+FB01>fty
 to sixty occasions. Its existence is consonant to what we should
 expect. It is hardly possible to conceive masses of air rotating in a
retrograde sense in close proximity, as cyclonogists suppose, without
 an intermediate area of direct rotation, which would, to use a mechani
 cal simile, be in gear with both of them, and make the movements of
the entire system correlative and harmonious.
    The result I have thus far arrived at, and which I should look for
 hereafter, is that whenever the barometer shows circumscribed areas
 of marked elevation and depression at distances not exceeding 1500

    “ Note on the Spectrum of Thallium.”                 By Professor William
Allen Miller, M.D., LL.D., Treasurer and V.P.R.S.
    My friend Mr. Crookes, the discoverer of the new metal tha1lium*,
having kindly put into my hands a small uantity of the metal, which
he believes to be chemically pure, I have een enabled to make some
experiments upon its spectrum, the results of which may not be with
out interest to the members of the Royal Society.
    Thallium, as is well known, when examined in the usual way by
the spectroscope, yields a spectrum of remarkable simplicity, furnish
ing a single intense green line, the occurrence of which, as is familiar
to chemists, led Mr. Crookes to the discovery of the metal, and sug
gested to him the name by which it is known. In order to try the
e<U+FB02>iect of a progressively increasing temperature upon the spectrum
furnished by the metal and its compounds, the following experiments
were made.
    Portions of metallic thallium, as well as of an alloy formed by
fusing a bead of thallium upon the end of a platinum wire, and por
tions of the sulphate of the metal were introduced successively,
<U+FB01>rst, into the <U+FB02>ame of burning hydrogen, and then into the oxyhy
drogen jet, and were in each case viewed by the spectroscope. As
the temperature increased in intensity, the brilliancy of the thallium
green line increased also, but no new lines made their appearance.
   * It has been made the subject of question abroad, whether Mr. Crookes or M.
Lamy was the <U+FB01>rst to recognize the metallic nature of thallium, and thus to
dispute the claim of Mr. Crookes to the full credit due to him for his investigation
(with only about twenty grains of the element) of its leading characters where no
previous clue existed to guide him. It may be sut<U+FB01>cient to state in answer to this
suggestion, that Mr. Crookes had exhibited it at the International Exhibition, and
marked as metallic his scanty store, though in the form of a precipitate, in the
beginning of May, unquestionably before M. Lamy had published anything re
lating to thallium.  ‘           '                   ‘

               Dr. Miller on the Spectrum of Thallium.             229
   Two pieces of stout thallium wire were then arranged as electrodes
to the secondary wire of an induction coil. A continuous torrent of
sparks was maintained without melting the wires or producing very
rapid oxidation, or volatilization of the metal; the light, however,
was much whiter than its ordinary monochromatic character would
have led us to expect.      Mr. Crookes, who was with me during the
experiments, projected the image of the points by means of a lens
upon a distant white screen, when it was at once obvious that
the extremities of the spark were of a <U+FB01>ne green colour, whilst the
<U+FB02>ickering luminous are, which <U+FB01>lled up the interval, due chie<U+FB02>y to
ignited air, was much whiter.
   On viewing the sparks from the induction-coil by the spectroscope.
several new lines, independently of well-marked air-lines, made their
appearance. These lines were distinguished from air-lines by the
peculiar character which distinguishes most metallic lines, viz. the
much greater intensity of their extremities than of their central por
tions. Besides the usual intense line in the green, <U+FB01>ve others were
particularly observable: <U+FB01>rst, a very faint one in the orange ; next,
two of nearly equal intensity in the green, more refrangible than Tlas,
with a third much fainter, these three lines in the green being nearly
equidistant; whilst, 5th, in the blue was a bright well-de<U+FB01>ned line:
all these were strong at each extremity and evanescent in the central
portions.
   The induction-spark of thallium was then observed when produced
in a current of hydrogen gas. The air-lines disappeared, the pecu
liar lines of hydrogen were very manifest, particularly the line in
the red and one of the lines in the blue; whilst the new thallium
lines were preserved, with the exception of the feeblest, though all
were reduced in intensity.        '
   Finally, a photographic impression of the thallium spectrum upon
collodion was obtained by the method which I have described in a
paper communicated to the Royal Society in June last. An im res
sion extending to about division 154 of the scale then adopte was
obtained. This spectrum contains several very characteristic groups
of lines ; it recalls the features of the spectra of cadmium and zinc,
and less strongly that of lead.
   Measuring by the scale already adopted in my former paper, it is
found that there are two strong groups of lines at about 103 and
106. At 116, 121, and 126 are three groups-—the <U+FB01>rst two less
intense than the third, which is of about the same strength as the
earliest two. Several feebler pairs of dots follow, and the spectrum
terminates rather abruptly with four nearly equidistant groups, com
mencing respectively at 136, 141, 145, and 151. The <U+FB01>rst of these
groups is very strongly marked, the others are fainter, but of nearly
equal intensity.
   The remarkable way in which a spectrum at low temperatures so
simple becomes increased in complexity, both in the visible and in
the extra-visible portions, is of high interest considered in relation
to the physical cause of these phenomena; and it is not without
interest in a chemical sense, from its bearing upon the view sup
ported by Dumas, that thallium belongs to the alkaline group.

 Potassium and sodium exhibit no new lines in the induction-spark,
 merely a diffuse light <U+FB01>lling up the air-lines, and lithium but a
 single strong group at about 124. This physical character, added
 to the more purely chemical ones of the insolubility of the sulphide,
 the chromate, the iodide, the sparing solubility of the chloride, the
 phosphate, the oxalate, the ferrocyanide, the occurrence of a power
 fully basic oxide, and of a higher feebly acid oxide, may therefore
 assist in showing the resemblance of thallium to silver or to lead,
 which latter metal in density, colour, softness, and external appear
ance it so closely simulates.
    It would be easy to point out other particulars in which the proper
 ties of thallium are in strong contrast with those of the alkali metals.
The chemical energy of these metals, lithium, sodium, potassium,
rubidium, and caesium, increases in the order mentioned, which is
 that of their equivalents. Thallium, with a higher equivalent than
 any of these, shows a greatly diminished chemical activity. The metal
 is readily reduced by zinc from its solutions. Its oxide, instead of
being like that of all the alkalies, excessively deliquescent, is perma
nent in air, and forms a closely adhering coat like that which is
produced upon the surface of zinc or lead, protecting the metal
beneath from further change.
    In many points the chemical reactions of thallium resemble those
 of silver, to which metal it is also further approximated by the cir
cumstance that the atomic heat of the metal, like that of silver, is
double that of the series to which lead belongs. Although there
fore in other physical properties thallium differs greatly from silver,
it seems to be more closely allied to that metal than to any other.

On the Composition of the Blue Derivatives of the Tertiary Mona

    The chemical visitors of the International Exhibition will not easily
forget the magni<U+FB01>cent collection of products displayed in the French
court by M. Menier of Paris. Among these compounds, equally
remarkable for their variety and beauty, the large crystals of cyaniue,
rivalling in splendour and purity Mr. Nicholson’s acetate of
rosaniline, have attracted general attention.     M. Menier, who has
produced this new dye on a very large scale, has most liberally placed
at my disposal some of the <U+FB01>nest of these crystals for examination,
hoping that their more minute investigation might perhaps lead to a
method of giving solidity to this new colour, which in brilliancy and
purity of tint is second to none of the several blues lately derived
from coal-tar.    The composition of cyanine and its mode of forma
tion having hitherto remained unknown, I have gladly availed myself
of this opportunity of performing some experiments with this inter
esting compound.       I am sorry to say that, in a practical point of
view, these experiments have failed entirely; but my studies have
led me to some observations on this substance which, as a contribu

    Hofmann on the Blue Derivatives of the Tertiary Monamines. 231
    tion to the history of cyanine, deserve to be recorded, and which I
    beg leave to communicate to the Royal Society.
      The discovery of the blue compounds from chinoline and its homo
   logues dates as far back as 1856.      In that year Mr. G. Williams
   engaged in a renewed examination of the base extracted by Runge
   from coal-tar and obtained by Gerhardt from the alkaloids of the
   cinchona bark, the identity in composition of which I had established
   in one of my earlier researches. Among the numerous compounds
   of these bases most carefully examined by Mr. G. Williams on this
   occasion, were also their methylated and ethylated derivatives, one of
   which, the iodide of methyl-leucolylammonium, I had discovered
   when studying the action of iodide of methyl upon ammonia and its
  analogues.     It was in preparing this compound from the chinoline
  obtained by the distillation of cinchonine, and in separating the am
  monium-base corresponding to the iodide by means of oxide of silver,
  that Mr. Williams <U+FB01>rst observed the splendid coloration which has led
  him to the discovery of the new dye now commercially known under
  the name of cyanine. Precisely similar phenomena were subse
  quently (in 1857) observed by M. von Babo, who produced them by
  treating chinoline with the sulphates of methyl and ethyl, and
  described the coloured substances thus obtained as methylirisiue and
  ethylirisine.- Mr. Williams was inclined to attribute the formation
  of the blue compounds, in which he recognized distinctly basic pro
  perties, to a process of oxidation ; M. von Babo represents his methyl
  and ethylirisine, although with very great reserve, by the formulae
                     C11 H14 N2 02   and   C13 H18 N2 02'
     No attempt has since been made to establish the composition of
  these singular compounds by a more minute examination. In fact
 several years elapsed without any further notice being taken of them,
 imtil the development of the aniline industry revived the memory of
 these remarkable colour phenomena, which have since attracted the
 general attention of dyers and printers. Mr. G. Williams showed
 that, among the several coloured compounds produced by the action
 of iodides of alcohol radicals upon chinoline bases, the one obtained
 by means of iodide of amyl is particularly rich in tinctorial power;
he has given a very interesting account of this new dye, and accu
 rately described the mode of manufacture of this body, which, under
the name of cyanine, soon became an article of commerce.
     Unfortunately the tint produced by cyanine is less fast than beau
tiful, and the hopes entertained of the industrial future of the new
compound has not been realized; nevertheless the importance at
tached by dyers to Mr. Williams’s discovery is well marked by the
fact of a gold medal, together with a prize of 10,000 francs, having
been proposed for the discovery of a means of rendering stable the
beautiful colours dyed by cyanine.
    The crystals submitted to me for examination by M. Menier were
distinct prisms, sufficiently well formed for crystallographical deter
minations.       They are at present in the hands of Quintino Sella.
Their substance possesses a beautiful green metallic lustre with a
golden tint, by which, as well as by crystalline form, they are readily

distinguished from acetate of rosaniline, which they in other respects
much resemble.     The crystals are insoluble in anhydrous ether, (liti
cultly soluble in water, but dissolve readily in alcohol. The solution
has a magni<U+FB01>cent blue colour, with a coppery iridescence on its sur
face. Addition of acids destroys this colour. Ammonia and the <U+FB01>xed
caustic alkalies leave the colour apparently untouched ; but it is now
produced by a <U+FB01>nely divided deep-blue precipitate suspended in the
lh<U+FB01>llld, which may be <U+FB01>ltered oil’, the <U+FB01>ltrate separated from it being
co ourless.
   The green crystals were found to be the iodide of a peculiar basic
compound. The iodine is rather <U+FB01>rmly held in this compound ; but it
may be precipitated from the alcoholic solution by oxide of silver, and
exchanged for bromine or chlorine by treatment of this solution with
bromide or chloride of silver, when the bromide or chloride corre
sponding to the iodide are produced. The analysis of the crystals
gave results indicating unequivocally the formula
                              C30 Hes N2 I’
which received a close con<U+FB01>rmation by the examination of a <U+FB01>ne
platinum-salt crystallizing in rhombic tablets, which is obtained by
precipitating the chloride corresponding to the iodide, strongly acidu
lated with hydrochloric acid, by dichloride of platinum. Neverthe
less slight discrepancies between the theoretical values of the formula
and the results obtained led me to assume the existence in the crystals
of a compound containing less carbon and hydrogen, indeed of a
homologous iodide,
                              0,, H3, N, 1.
This hypothesis, not countenanced at <U+FB01>rst by the remarkable con
stancy which the composition of the iodide presented even after three
or four crystallizations, was fully con<U+FB01>rmed when the chloride was
submitted to a systematic partial precipitation by dichloride of
platinum. After several repetitions of the process, the partially
precipitated platinum-salt being decomposed by sulphuretted hydro
gen and the chlorides again partially precipitated, two platinum-salts
were obtained, one of which, the less soluble one, proved to be the
pure platinum-salt corresponding to the iodide with 30 equivalents
of carbon, whilst the other one was sufficiently pure to show that it
belonged in reality to the homologous iodide with 2 equivalents of
carbon less.

    The explanation of the formation of the iodide presents no di<U+FB02>i

  In fact Mr. Williams, in describing the preparation of his dye,
  distinctly states that the chinoline by no means requires to be pure
  for the purpose. M. Menier has moreover kindly furnished me with
  a considerable quantity of the crude material from which the green
  crystals are obtained.     This proved to be a mixture of several bases,
  in which the presence of lepidine and chinoline was traced without
  the slightest dif<U+FB01>cult , by the analyses of platinum-salts.

  These crystals are isomeric with iodide of amyl-lepidyl-ammonium,
  from which, however, they are distinguished by all their properties.
  They dissolve in cold water without decomposition, but on addition
  of alcohol they immediately assume‘ a blue coloration, the original
  monacid compound being reproduced. The same change takes place
  at 100°; so thatin preparing the compound for analysis it was neces
  sary to dry it in vacuo. In the facility with which the diacid com
  pounds are converted into the monacid salts, this substance resembles
  rosaniline, which, as I have pointed out in a recent paper, forms
  likewise colourless acid salts of little stability.
     The green iodide dissolves with equal facility in hydrochloric and
  hydrobromic acid, yielding perfectly colourless solutions, and giving
  rise to the formation of well-crystallized compounds, which contain, in
  addition to iodine, respectively bromine and chlorine.
    On submitting the green iodide in alcoholic solution to the action
  of chloride of silver, the whole of the iodine is separated in the form
  of iodide of silver, a blue solution being obtained from which the
  monacid chloride crystallizes, on slow evaporation, in green metal
  lustrous sharply-de<U+FB01>ned prisms of surpassing beauty. This salt

 was found to contain
                                    C30 H39 N Cl.
 Dissolved in hydrochloric acid, this salt furnished a diacid compound
 which, on evaporation in vacuo, separates in long straw-coloured
 needles. The highly deliquescent character of this substance has
 hitherto prevented me from analysing it; but if there was the slightest
 doubt of this compound having the composition
                     C,O Hm N2 Cl,=C,0 H39 N2 Cl, H Cl,
 it would be dispelled by the analysis of a <U+FB01>ne-yellow di<U+FB01>icultly solu
 ble platinum-salt crystallizing in small well-de<U+FB01>ned rhombic plates,
 which falls directly on addition of dichloride of platinum to the alco
 holic solution of the diacid chloride, containing a considerable amount
 of hydrochloric acid, and which, by analysis, was found to be repre
 sented by the formula
                            C3,, H,0 N2 C12, 2 Pt Cl2. _
 The gold-salt is obtained by precipitating the solution of the acid
 chloride with trichloride of gold, when a yellow, scarcely crystalline
precipitate is formed, which, dried in vacuo, contains
                             C30 H40 N2 C12, 2Au C1,.
 I have, moreover, prepared the monacid bromide, which forms beau
 tiful metal-lustrous prisms easily crystallizable ; the diacid nitrate as
a crystalline network, on evaporating a solution of the base in nitric
 acid in vacuo ; and, lastly, the acid sulphate, which crystallizes in
 white, well-formed rhombic tables, very soluble in water, but insoluble
 in alcohol, by which it is not decomposed like the other diacid com
pounds.
    I have refrained from multiplying the analytical evidences by the
minute examination of these salts, because I was happy enough to
 observe a reaction which supported the interpretation of the results
 of analysis in an unequivocal manner. Remembering the simple
 scissiou which I had formerly accomplished by exposing the iodide
of tetrethylammonium to the action of heat, when the compound
splits into iodide of ethyle and triethylamine, I was induced to submit
the green iodide to distillation. The green crystals rapidly fuse into
a blue liquid, the surface of which presents a peculiar coppery lustre.
On raising the temperature, decomposition takes place, and in the
receiver is condensed a mixture of lepidine and iodide of amyle, the
reunion of which to iodide of amyl-lepidyl-ammonium may be pre
vented by collecting them in hydrochloric acid; at the same time a.
gas is evolved, burning with a brilliant <U+FB02>ame and readily absorbed by
bromine, and which could easily be condensed by passing it through
a serpentine surrounded with ice. I was thus enabled to collect
enough of the volatile hydrocarbon to determine its boiling-point,
which proved it to be pure amylene. If the heat be carefully regu
lated, the amount of charcoal remaining in the retort is comparatively
small. The interpretation of the phenomena observed is given in
the following equation :

  Hofmann on the Blue Derivatives ofthe Tertiary Monamines. 235
     Here, again, I have had an opportunity of proving the presence
  in the crystals of a small quantity of the homologous chinolinc com
  pound; for on submitting, after separating the iodide of amyle, the
  hydrochlorate of the volatilized base to distillation with potassa,
  and collecting apart the <U+FB01>rst quantity of the basic liquid which came
  over with the vapour of water, this substance proved by the plati
  num determination to be chie<U+FB02>y chinolinc, while the portion of the

  lepThe  results obtained in these experiments furnish new illustrations

  and their derivatives are distinguished. Only a few weeks ago I
  had the honour of submitting to the Royal Society a short ac

 characterize them as para-compounds of the amyl-lepidyl-ammonium
 salts, but I am far from attributing to these formulae any other
 value. In fact the molecular construction of this new class of
 compounds remains to be established by further experiments.
    The theory which (in 1852) satisfactorily represented the consti
tution of the nitrogen bases then examined, requires an expansion to
include the tinctorial ammonias added to our knowledge during the
last decade. The time for the enunciation of this ampli<U+FB01>ed theory
has not yet arrived.
    Here only a few experiments may still be mentioned, which were
made with the oxide corresponding with the salts described.
    The action of oxide of silver upon the iodide dissolved in alcohol
liberates the base, which, on evaporation of the alcohol, separates as
an indistinctly crystalline deep-blue mass, moderately soluble in water,
less soluble in anhydrous ether, easily soluble in alcohol.               Ether
precipitates the base from its alcoholic solution; I have not exa
mine d it.

    Submitted to distillation, the free oxide gives rise to an oily base,
 which I naturally expected to be lepidine; but the experiments which
 I have hitherto made with this substance appear to negative this
 assumption. I have undertaken a more minute examination of the
 compound, because, if it be di<U+FB02>'erent, its study will probably throw
 some light upon the still uncertain constitution of the tertiary bases
 of the chinoline series, which I have frequently attempted to decipher.
 It remained now only for me to examine the mode of formation
 of the remarkable compound the nature of which I have endeavoured
 to clear up.   With this view I have studied the action of iodide of
 methyle and amyle upon chinoline and lepidine, large quantities of
 which were kindly placed at my disposal by my friend Mr. David
 Howard. The products obtained in this reaction I have not sub
 mitted to aminute examination, having satis<U+FB01>ed myself that their
 principal phases are well illustrated by the equations whichl have
 given for the formation of the substances produced by the action of
 iodide of amyle upon lepidine. Nor have I followed out in detail the
 complicated secondary changes, and more especially the generation
 of the red colouring matter which is abundantly formed in these
 reactions. I have nothing to add to the perfect description of these
 phenomena by the distinguished discoverer of this pigment.
    In conclusion I may be allowed to express my best thanks to M.
 Menier: without the magni<U+FB01>cent crystals furnished by his ateliers, I
 could not have even attempted to clear up this question.
    Though proud of her o<U+FB02>ice as guide of industry, science acknow

        ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF THALLIUM.
                      BY M. LUCIEN DE LA RIVE
     HE conductivity of thallium was measured by Wheatstone’s
      method, by comparing the resistance of a wire of this metal with
that of a standard of distilled mercury.     The thallium used was a
specimen given by M. Lamy to the laboratory of the Ecole Normale.
It was formed into wire by being <U+FB01>rst melted, then hammered so as
to lengthen the bar, and <U+FB01>nally passed through the draw plate. The
latter operation is rendered di<U+FB02>icult by the feeble tenacity of the
thallium; the metal must be frequently moistened, and the wire
carefully drawn, so as to obtain a certain degree of <U+FB01>neness‘.

    The resistance was always determined a short time after the wire
had been drawn ; but its surface was nevertheless covered with a layer
of oxide ; yet, as it was not possible to observe an increase of resist
ance from this time, it is presumable that the in<U+FB02>uence of this cir
cumstance on the conductivity may be neglected. A wire exposed
to the air for twenty-four hours experienced an increase of resistance
of about            The mean of the values of C is 5'3 at the tempera
ture of 12° compared with mercury at 14°. The conductivity of
mercury is 1'63, that of silver being 100, which gives for thallium
8'64, a value between that of lead 7'77, and that of tin l1'45, and
which is far less than the conductivity of the alkaline metals.

ON THE MAGNETICAL DEPORTMENT OF SOME CYANOGEN COM
    POUNDS OF IRON, NICKEL, AND COBALT.             BY DR. J. WIE—
    SENER.
   The following conclusions have been arrived at aftera lengthened
 investigation of this subject :—
    I. Those cyanogen compounds of iron, nickel, and cobalt in
which these metals are present as in an haloid, or ordinary salt, are
paramagnetic.
    2. Those compounds in which the cyanogen appears to form with
either of the three metals a compound radical (in which therefore
iron, nickel, or cobalt cannot be directly detected) may either be
paramagnetic or diamagnetic.
    3. The compounds of the general formula Ni Cy2 Me are, as far
as the present investigations have extended, diamagnetic.
   4. The compounds constituted like hydroferrocyanic acid, Fe Cy3
H H, are diamagnetic if the hydrogen is replaced by diamagnetic
metals, but paramagnetic if by magnetic metals.
   5. The cobalticyanide compounds show the same deportment.
    6. The compounds analogous to hydroferricyanic acid are without
exception paramagnetic.—Sitzungsbericht der Wiener Academic, vol.

RESEARCHES       ON    THE   OPTICAL   PROPERTIES    DEVELOPED     IN
    TRANSPARENT BODIES BY THE ACTION 01' MAGNETISM.                BY
    M. VERDET.
   I have the honour to submit to the Academy the result of a
series of experiments on the relation existing between the magnetic
rotation of the plane of polarization of a ray of homogeneous light,
and its wave-length. An experiment by M. Edmond Becquerel,
which consisted in compensating the action of a piece of heavy glass
placed between the branches of an electromagnet by the action of a
 column of solution of sugar, seemed to show that, for this substance
at least, the law of rotations differed little from the law of the
inverse ratio of the square of the lengths of undulation. More
recent researches by M. Wiedemann led to the conclusion, lst, that
the law did not apply to sulphide of carbon, and is therefore
wanting in generality; 2nd, that when an active substance, such as
essence of lemon or oil of turpentine, was submitted to the magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence, there was, for each colour, proportionality between the

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  239
magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization, and the rotation due
to the special action of the substance.
   In my experiments I have used the general method of M. Fizeau
and M. Foucault, which consists in intercepting on a prism the
light originally polarized and transmitted by the transparent body,
and studying the state of polarization of the various parts of the
spectrum.      To the rays whose plane of polarization is parallel to
 the principal section of the analysing Nicol, a black band corre
 sponds, the middle of which is successively brought to coincide with
 rays whose wave-lengths are known by Fraunliofer’s experiments;
 the displacement which the analyser must undergo in order to re
 establish coincidence with a given ray, when the direction of the
 current is changed, is exactly double the rotation due to the action
 of magnetic forces.
    The following Table contains the relative values of the rotations
 corresponding to the live rays C, D, E, F, G*, for substances which
 I have studied, the rotation corresponding to the ray E being taken
 as unity :—

 which does not much differ from any of the series in the preceding
 Table.     Considering the nature of the liquids which deviate most
 from the law (sulphide of carbon, essences, creosote), the results of
 my experiments may be summed up in the following three propo
 sitions :
     1. The magnetic rotations of the plane of polarization of rays of
 different colours follow approximately the law of the inverse ratio of
 the square of the wave-lengths.
     2. The exact law of the phenomena, is that the product of the
 rotation by the square of the wave-length increases from the least to '
 the most refrangible end of the spectrum.
    3. The substances for which this increase is most perceptible are
 also those which have the greatest dispersive power.
    * _Any observation of the rays B and H is impossible ; and I have only
 obtained even slightly satisfactory results for the rays C and G by placing
 in front of the eye coloured glasses which extinguished the middle and
 brilliant region of the spectrum without sensibly weakening the lustre of
 the adjacent portion of these rays.

                            [With 9. rim]
 IN the <U+FB01>rst detailed communication which Kirchhoff and I
      made respecting caesium and some of its compounds, pub
lished in vol. xxii. pp. 329 Sr 498 of this Magazine, we distinctly
stated that the determination of the atomic weight of the new
metal there described could only be considered as preliminary.
The quantity of material, extracted from nearly one-hundred
thousand pounds of the mineral water of Diirkheim, with which
the whole investigation had to be made, amounted only to from 2
to 3 grammes, and therefore did not permit an exact and de<U+FB01>ni
tive estimation of the atomic weight. Since the publication of
this memoir, I hoped toobtain amore abundant supply of mate
rial from the water of the “ Murquelle” in Baden-Baden, which
exhibits the reactions of caesium and rubidium more plainly than
the Diirkheim mineral water.       I found, however, after evapo
ting 30,000 lbs. of this water, using for this purpose nearly
5 tons of coal, that the mother-liquor yielded only 1'5 grni. of
pure chloride of caesium. According to an investigation made
by Professor Bixio, 1000 parts of thi mother-liquor possesses
the following composition :—
               Sulphate of calcium .      .  .    1'861

   The residues which I obtained from the preparation of half a
pound of pure chloride of rubidium from lepidolite likewise gave
no larger a yield of caesium-salt; so that the quantity of material
with which I have been obliged to conduct the following experi
ments has also been but very small.
    Whilst I was thus engaged with the preparation of caesium
salt for the purpose of making a more exact determination _of
the atomic weight of this metal, Messrs. Johnson and Allen* were
fortunate enough to obtain a specimen of American lepidolite so
rich in caesium that they were able to prepare about 30 grms. of
bitartrate of caesium from a. few kilogrammes of the mineral.
With this material, Messrs. Allen and Johnson prepared the acid
tartrates of caesium and rubidium, employing the great diifer
ence in the solubility of these salts for the purpose of separating
the two metals by repeated crystallization. They thus obtained
a chloride of caesium which, according to four analyses made by
them, possessed the following composition :-—
               Chlorine.                              Caesium.
               210414:      .   .   .    .    .   . .  78’956

               21'O63       .   .   .    .    .   . .  78937
    The purest chloride compound which I was able to obtain by
help of the method which I <U+FB01>rst used contained 1‘—~
                -                        Chlorine.          Caesium.

          Third puri<U+FB01>cation .          . 22'316              77684
From the close agreement of the above numbers, it is clear that
in the method of separation which I employed at the time of the
discovery of caesium a limit is reached beyond which the puri<U+FB01>
cation cannot be carried. The method employed by Messrs.
Johnson and Allen is likewise inapplicable in the case of
the small quantity of material to which my experiments were
limited, and I have therefore endeavoured to purify the salt by
another method. This is based upon the fact that the acid
tartrate of caesium, like the corresponding rubidium-salt, is
unalterable in the air, Whilst the neutral tartrate of caesium deli
quesces very readily. This method of separation answers very
well even with very small quantities. Having determined, by
precipitation with silver, the quantity of rubidium in a mixture
of the chlorides free from potassium, lithium, and sodium, the

 chlorides are converted into carbonates: rather more tartaric acid
 is then added to the solution of the carbonates than is su<U+FB02>icient
 to convert the caesium-compound into the neutral, and the rubi
 dium-compound into the acid tartrate. The <U+FB01>nely divided solid
 mass obtained by evaporation and trituration is brought on to a
 funnel containing a small <U+FB01>lter, and then left for some time
 exposed to a moist atmosphere. The deliquescent caesium-salt
 drops slowly down, whilst the acid tartrate of rubidium remains
 unaltered in the funnel. In this way a substance was obtained
 which, when converted into chloride, gave upon analysis the fol
 lowing numbers :—
    l'3033 grm. of this chloride of caesium yielded P1422 grm.
 chloride of silver. This corresponds to
                    Chlorine.            Caesium .
                     21709 . . . . 78'29l
    This salt exhibited in the spectroscope but a faint rubidium
 reaction, but it had taken up a small quantity of lithium- and
 potassium-compounds from the tartaric acid. In order to sepa
 rate these impurities, a boiling and somewhat dilute solution of
 the salt was precipitated by chloride of platinum, and the preci
 pitate, after having been washed by decantation with hot water
 and dried, was reduced in a stream of hydrogen.     This mode of
 puri<U+FB01>cation was repeated until the composition of the chlorine
 compound remained unaltered. In this way the following results
 were obtained :—
    After the second puri<U+FB01>cation with PtCl9,
 l'8987 grm. of substance yielded P6342 grm. chloride of silver.
    After the fourth puri<U+FB01>cation with PtCl‘3,
 l'3835 grm. of substance yielded 1'1781 grm. chloride of silver.
    After the <U+FB01>fth puri<U+FB01>cation with PtCl9,
 1'3682 grm. of substance yielded 11644: grm. chloride of silver.
    After the sixth puri<U+FB01>cation with I’tClQ,
P2478 grm. of substance yielded 1'O623 grm. chloride of silver.
   These numbers correspond respectively to the following com
position of the chloride :
                 Chlorine.                   Casium.

   The mean of the three last experiments, in which the compo
sition may be assumed to have become constant, shows that

 21'O5l3 per cent. of chlorine was contained in the salt. This
 number very closely agrees with the mean from Johnson and
 Allen’s experiments, viz. 210452. The more exact atomic
 weight of caesium is therefore—
    According to Johnson and Allen’s determinations .       133'03
    According to my own determinations .          . . . .   132'99
 Hence, until a more exact determination be made, we may take
 the atomic weight of caesium, as the mean of these two determi
 nations, to be 133.
    In the paper already referred to*, I remarked that chloride of
 caesium readily attracts moisture from the air and deliquesces.
 Johnson and Allen, on the contrary, state that the salt prepared
 by them, and used for their determination of the atomic weight,
 did not possess this property. They say in their memoir, “We
 thus obtained an amorphous mass, of a pure white colour, which,
 unlike Bunsen’s chloride, was not perceptibly deliquescent even in
 a very moist atmosphere.” And further, “As to the properties
 of the chloride of caesium, we observed that not only is it not
 deliquescent, but it is hardly hygroscopic. The unfused and
porous salt may be weighed in moist air with as much accuracy
 as chloride of sodium.” In spite of this statement, I must
adhere to my previous observation. Even the chloride of cae
 sium which may be considered to be spectrum-analytically
pure, having the atomic weight of 133, exhibits a high de
 gree of deliquescence in moist air, as is seen from the fol
lowing experiments :--O'O2715 grm. of powdered chloride of
caesium, which had been evaporated with a few drops of hydro
chloric acid and dried for two hours at 130°, when spread
out upon a platinum capsule deliquesced in a few hours to a
liquid in which no solid substance could be seen. In the <U+FB01>rst
two hours the weight of the salt had increased by 00068 grm.,
in the second two hours 00065 grm., and in the third two hours
_O'OO30 grm., thus taking up within six hours a quantity of
water from the air equal to half its own weight. 22 milli
grammes of the fused salt deliquesced quickly in the air, and
after fourteen hours had taken up 19 milligrammes, or nearly its
own weight of water. In dry air only, this liquid dries up to a
solid mass. The chlorides of potassium and sodium, portions of
which were exposed simultaneously to the same air as the chlo
ride of caesium, did not exhibit any deliquescence even after an
exposure of twenty-four hours. Hence Messrs. Allen and John
son seem to have made their experiments in comparatively dry
air, in which, as is well known, many deliquescent substances

 do not exhibit this property; and for this reason they have failed
 to remark the hygroscopic nature of the chloride of caesium.
    In our memoir on the new metals* we have distinctly stated
 that we have represented in our drawing only those lines which,
 on account of their position, sharpness, or intensity, serve as the
 best means of detecting the presence of the substances in ques
 tion. Messrs. Johnson and Allen remark with regard to this,
 “ Kirchhoff and Bunsen, in the <U+FB01>gure given by them (Phil. Mag.
 vol. xxii. 1861), represent eleven lines. We <U+FB01>nd without di<U+FB01>i
 culty seven more lines, and observe further that some of those
 <U+FB01>gured by Kirchhoff and Bunsen are not mapped in their correct
 positions.” In reply to this remark, we must regret that Messrs.
 Johnson and Allen appear to have neglected to make an exact
 comparison of their spectrum with ours, otherwise they would
 have easily convinced themselves that the lines which they have
 drawn correspond as closely as can be expected with those
 which we. represented, whilst they would at the same time have
 noticed that three lines occur on our drawing which are not seen
 at all in the caesium spectrum. These three lines were printed
 in a large number of the lithographs by a mistake of the printer,
 and lie close to the right of the lines marked VI., X., and XV.
 by Messrs. Johnson and Allen. Setting aside these three lines,
introduced by a mistake of the lithographer, we have the follow
 ing agreement of the several readings :—

   The <U+FB01>rst column contains the numbers by which Messrs.
Johnson and Allen have designated the lines observed by them in
                   * Phil. Mag. vol. xxii. p. 508.

 the caesium spectrum ; the second gives the readings on the scale
 of their apparatus corresponding to these lines ; the third column
 contains numbers representing the same readings reduced to the
 scale which is given in the Plate published with our memoir in
 Fresenius’s ‘Journal of Analytical Chemistry’*. This reduc
 tion is founded upon the statement made by Messrs. Johnson
 and Allen, that on their scale the sodium line lay at 100, and
 the blue strontium line at 156. On the scale contained in
 Fresenius’s Journal, the left edge of the sodium line lies at 50,
 that of the blue strontium line at 56; hence the numbers of
 the third column are easily obtained from those of the second
 simply by subtracting 50. The fourth column contains the
 positions of the caesium lines from our drawing in Poggendor<U+FB01>"s
 Annalen reduced to the same scale.
    On comparing the corresponding numbers in the third and
 fourth columns we do not <U+FB01>nd any di<U+FB01>erences of real moment.
 A more exact agreement can hardly be expected when we re
 member that in the absolute position of the lines of the spectrum
 seen upon a scale such as we used, and as Messrs. Johnson and
 Allen, as far as can be gathered from their description, appear to
have used, unavoidable errors of observation are introduced,
which are rendered less evident (owing to the achromatism of the
glass lenses and of the eye) by the fact that, in whatever
position the apparatus may be placed, only one point on the
spectrum can be distinctly read off on the scale. In construct
ing our apparatus with a photographic scale, we did not deviate
without good reason from the much more accurate means of
measurement used by physicists in the determination of the
refractive indices of transparent bodies, inasmuch as the che
mist, for whom our apparatus is specially designed, does not
require so much an exact knowledge of the absolute position of
the single lines in the spectrum as he needs to be able to observe
quickly and easily, especially when lines have to be recognized
which only <U+FB02>ash out for a moment. The point of greatest im
portance in spectrum-analysis is the degree of certainty with
which it is possible to decide whether two lines are identical in
position or not; and this decision is most easily attained by
means of the small prism on the slit.
   The slight differences which appear between the numbers in the
third and those in the fourth column may further be caused from
errors in the interpolation which has to be made in order to reduce
the readings of one apparatus to the scale of another. For the pur
pose of comparing their observations with ours, Messrs. Johnson
and Allen have reduced their readings to the scale from which
the numbers in column 3 are derived, and they have then repre
  * Fresenius’ Zeitschriftfdr Analytische Chemie, l862, Heft 1, <U+FB01>g. 2.

                      Prof. Bunsen on Gasium.                    247
sented their reduced observations in a drawing. This drawing
does not agree at all well with the numbers in column 3, and it
is therefore evident that a different mode of interpolation must
have been used by Messrs. Johnson and Allen from that which
I have employed. In their paper they do not describe the method
which they adopted for reducing their observations; the follow
ing example shows, however, that their method cannot have
been a suitable one.      According to the above statement, the
value of one division on the two scales from which the number
in columns 1 and 2 are derived is nearly equal, and the divi
sions 100 and 50 correspond exactly to each other as the/sodium
line stood at these points on both scales. Now Messrs. Johnson
and Allen read off on their instrument division 101 for the line
VIlI.; hence, when this .is reduced to the other scale, we must
obtain a value nearly equal to 51. In Messrs. Johnson and Allen’s
drawing, however, the line VIII. has the limits 525 and 53'5.
   A glance at the foregoing Table shows that Messrs. Johnson and
Allen have observed a large number of lines which are not repre
sented in our drawing. The greater number of these we have also
measured; but they were not included in the drawing, because, as
we have already frequently remarked, we did not endeavour to ca
talogue the lines completely, but to represent as truly as possible
the characteristic appearances of the spectra of the several sub
stances. Owing to the difficulty of accurately distributing many
 shades of the same colour in chromolithographic printing, the
weaker lines have necessarily been omitted in our drawings.
    I have still to observe, in reference to Messrs. Johnson and
 Allen’s remarks, that it is line XVI., and not line XV. as they
 state, which is coincident with Fraunhofer’s line E.
    In order to avoid errors similar to those which I have exposed
in the foregoing, and for the purpose of facilitating the nume
 rical comparison of the data of various spectrum-observations,
 we give in Plate V. graphical representations of the observations
which are taken from the guiding lines given in the chromo
lithograph drawings of the spectra published in our former
memoirs and in which the prism was placed at the angle of
minimum deviation. The ordinates of the edges of the small
 blackened surfaces, referred to the divisions of the scale as ab
 scissae, represent the intensity of the several lines with their
characteristic gradations of shade. These drawings were made
when the slit was so broad and the <U+FB02>ame of such a temperature,
that the <U+FB01>ne bright line upon the broad band Ca a began to be
distinctly visible. This breadth of the slit was equal to the fortieth
part of the distance between the sodium line and the lithium line a.
For the sake of perspicuity, the continuous spectra which some
bodies exhibit are specially represented on the upper edge of the

248         Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation in
 scale, to the divisions of which they are referred as abscissae. In
 order to render these drawings, which have reference to our in
 strunient, applicable to observations upon the scale of any other
 apparatus, which we may call B, it is only necessary to prepare
 a reduced scale which is laid upon the several drawings and used
in place of the divided scale given on the Plate. The lines
marked at the bottom of Plate V. serve for the preparation of
this new scale: these lines denote the distances between the
lines Ku, Lia, Na, Tl, Sr 8, Rb at, and KB, measured according
to the scale of our instrument. The position of each of these
lines is determined by the edge of the line, which does not change
its place on altering the breadth of the slit. The position of these
same lines is read off on the scale of the instrument B, and the cor
responding number written under each. A series of <U+FB01>xed points
on the scale is thus obtained, and the complete divisions for the
scale of the instrument B are got by interpolating the values of
the portions of the scale situated between the <U+FB01>xed points. The
sodium line is then inserted in this scale, which is pasted upon
a straight-edge, and the divisions numbered in tens and <U+FB01>ves.
If this measure be now laid upon any one of the drawings so
that the sodium line on the measure coincides with the division
50 on the drawing, the scale on the measure will give the position
of all the lines in the particular spectrum exactly as they are
seen in the photographic scale of the instrument B. When the
position of the line under observation has in this way been ascer
tained, it is easy to assure oneself of its exact identity by means
of the small prism on the slit.

XXXV. On Chemical Notation in conformity with theDg/riamical
     Theory of Heat and Gases. By J. J. WATERSTON, Esq.*
    N a lecture “ On the Molecule of Water,” lately delivered at
       the Royal Institution, Albcmarle Street, by Mr. Odling,
Secretary to the Chemical Societyt, the question as to the mole
cular weight of water was discussed with much detail, and argu
ments adduced to show that the correct number is 18, represented
by the formula H2 O, and that it cannot be 9, as might be in
ferrcd from the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the vapour, following the idea
that equal volumes of bodies in the gaseous state contain an equal
number of atoms.
   The dynamical theory of heat and gases imperatively requires
us to believe that in equal volumes of gases and vapours in aequi

   conformity with the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Gases.       249
 librio of pressure and temperature (and conforming to the pri
 mary laws of Mariotte, and of Dalton and Gay-Lussac), there
 exists the same number of separate parts. On the other hand,
 these parts cannot be in all cases the atoms that enter into
 chemical union, or what is understood by the term “com
 bining element.” The researches of Dumas and Mitscher
 lich have brought out this fact very obviously in the case of
  sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, and selenium. In sulphur the
 ultimate element of the vapour or gaseous molecule must con
 sist of six chemical atoms up to the temperature of 860° C., at
 which, according to MM. Deville and Troost’s researches, the
 vapour-density is reduced to one-third, showing that the gaseous
 molecule had then split into three, each of which was made up
 of two chemical atoms.     In selenium, the vapour molecule must
 consist of four chemical atoms; and at 1040° C. there was found
 such alteration of vapour-density as led to the anticipation that
 from about 1200° to 1400° the ultimate vapour molecule would
 contain only two chemical atoms (MM. Deville and Troost,
 1860).
    If we were to view the ultimate moving part of all the pri
 mary gases as consisting of at least two chemical atoms, the
 same symbols would express not only the combining proportions
 of all the bodies entering into union, but the actual composition
 of a volume of the compound, and we should get rid at once of
 all the ambiguity and di<U+FB01>iculties in the arithmetic of combining
 proportions. The absolute necessity of doing so may, I think,
 be easily demonstrated from the examples chosen by Mr. Odling
in his lecture.
    The argument of the lecture is to show from the phenomena
 of substitution that the hydrogen of the water molecule is expe
 rimentally divisible into two equal parts; for it is from uch
 phenomena that the chief, if not only chemical proof is to be
found. To quote Mr. Odling’s words, “ It is evident, for instance,
 that the molecule of marsh-gas must contain four proportions of
 hydrogen, because we are able to replace one-fourth,-[two-fourths,
three-fourths, and four-fourths of its hydrogen by four succes
 sive substitutions to produce a series of bodies differing from one
another by a regular gradation of properties.”
    In marsh-gas the ratio of Hy, the quantity of hydrogen by
weight, to the carbon Car, is       If the vapour-density of carbon
were 3 to hydrogen unity, the numerator added to the denomi
nator of the fraction 5., making 4, would represent the vapour
density of marsh-gas, and be represented by HG (.z‘=y= 1), in
which the letters represent the vapour-densities of each of the
constituents respectively, But the vapour-density of marsh-gas
is 8 ; and assuming the vapour-density of carbon to be 12, we

250        Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical <U+FB02>otation in
have Hg/+C:v=8 and % = %; substituting 1 =H and 12:0,
we have y + 12.z'=8 and -1%”; =       From these two simple e<iua
tions we <U+FB01>nd .z'=.13 and 3/=2. Hence marsh-gas is expressed
by C§+H2=C‘ll"l2, which means that a gaseous molecule of
marsh-gas is composed of half a molecule of carbon united to
two gaseous molecules of hydrogen.
   In monochloromethene, or muriate of methyle, the ratio of the
hydrogen to the carbon is 2: 101% = 1%.        The ratio of the hy
  . to the chlorine

                                        362, and the vapour-den
sity of the compound is

From these three-equations we <U+FB01>nd :z'=z=% and 3/: 1%. Hence
this compound is expressed by H1%+C%+Cl%=Hl§ Cl Cl‘;
which means that its vapour-molecule is composed of one and a
half gaseous molecules of hydrogen, half a molecule of carbon,
and half a gaseous molecule of chlorine united together.
   In the same way dichloromethene, or chloride of methyle, is
expressed by HC§ C1, the vapour-density being

its vapour-molecule being composed of one gas-molecule of
hydrogen united to half a gas-molecule of oxygen.
   Phosphoretted hydrogen consists of one part by weight of
hydrogen united to 10'5 phosphorus, or %%= 1—(1)_5, and its
vapour-density is 17-5: Hg/+Pa:.       The vapour-density of phos
phorus being 64=P, we have
                    3/     1
                  6-4—E= W and y+64w=17'5.

   conformity with the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Gases.          251
  From these two equations we have y=1§ and .z*=.—1* ; and phos
  phoretted hydrogen is represented by H1’l'P*, which signi<U+FB01>es
  that a gaseous molecule of phosphoretted hydrogen is composed
  of 151 gas-molecule of hydrogen united to one-quarter of a.
  gaseous molecule of phosphorus. In the sesquichloride of phos
  phorus the weight of phosphorus is to the weight of chlorine as

 the compound is 70=P.2:+Clz=64~z-+36z. From these two
 equations .2: comes out =;}, and z=1%. Hence Pi Clli expresses
 the constitution and vapour-density or weight of a gaseous mole
 cule of the sesquichloride. 'Thus the combining element or
 chemical atom of phosphorus is still one-quarter the gaseous
 molecule.
    In the preceding examples the smallest combining element of
 chlorine is half the gaseous molecule. It combines also in the
 proportion 1, 1%, and 2 gaseous molecules.
    The smallest combining element of hydrogen is half the
 gaseous molecule. It combines also in the proportion 1, 1%, 2
 gaseous molecules; and further, in the organic compounds its
 combining proportions extend up to 16 gaseous molecules, as in
 petrolin or colophon, H""C‘°.
    The smallest combining element of oxygen is one-half the
 gaseous molecule.     It combines also in the proportion 1, 1%, 2,
2%, 3 gaseous molecules: e. g. an arsenious acid vapour-molecule
is composed of one arsenic vapour-molecule united with three
 oxygen gas-molecules.
    Muriatic acid gas, Cl?!‘ H5", is composed of single half molecules
 of its constituents united together.
    Cyanogen, NC, is composed of whole single molecules of its
constituents united together ; and this compound molecule
assumes the deportment of a chemical element by splitting into
two in some of its combinations with hydrogen, &c., as N‘5'C5Hf,
prussic acid ; Ni Ci C111‘, chloride of cyanogen; and Ni Ci Br“,
bromide of cyanogen.
   In silicated hydrogen the ratio of hydrogen to silicon is % =§I;—IZw,

and _1/=1;-. Ammonia is thus expressed by Ni H15‘, which
means that a gas-molecule of ammonia is composed of half a gas
molecule of nitrogen united to one and a half gas-molecule of
hydrogen.
   In some cases of composite bodies, the components separate
on boiling or sublimation. When this happens, the speci<U+FB01>c gra
vity of the vapour reveals the fact, as in the following instance.
   In sal-ammoniac the weight of ammonia is to the weight of
muriatic acid as 1 to 2235. Its vapour-density is 135
(N’lH1i)=8~5, H%o1%=1s-5.          Hence

from which we <U+FB01>nd a'=g/=5 ; and following the usual formula,
we might say half a gas-molecule of ammonia unites with half a
gas-molecule of muriatic acid to form one gas-molecule of muri
ate of ammonia; or if this splitting of (N% Hli into two (Ni Hi),
and Hi Cli into two (Hi Cli‘), is inadmissible, We have the alter
native of the two whole molecules remaining separate, and the
ammonia and acid vapour forming a simple mixture with speci<U+FB01>c
gravity 13'5, equal to the mean of the two

   The same is the case with the nitrous, formic, and acetic ethers,
but not so with the oxalic and succinic ethers.

   It will be remarked that the symbols and notation, compared
with the vapour-density, reveal such facts without any effort of
the attention.
   Mr. Odling advocates Gerhardt’s system of notation; but
although it is nominally based, like that of Berzelius, on the so

   conformity with the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Gases.    253
 called hypothesis that all simple gases contain equal numbers of
 atoms in equal volumes, it does not recognize the di<U+FB01>erence
 between gaseous molecule and chemical atom so distinctly as to
 avoid obscurity and misrepresentation: e. y. Mr. Odling states
 that “ when water is acted upon by metallic sodium, one equiva
 lent of sodium expels one equivalent of hydrogen to form the
 well-de<U+FB01>ned body hydrate of sodium, and the action proceeds no
 further; but when melted hydrate of sodium at a temperature
 approaching that of redness is acted upon by metallic sodium, a
 second equivalent of sodium turns out a second equivalent of
 hydrogen to produce oxide of sodium.” The diagram appended
 represents the half of the hydrogen in one molecule of water as
 expelled by a molecule of sodium to form the solid hydrate, and
 afterward the second half to produce the oxide of sodium. Now
 the fact is, that two molecules of water are engaged in forming
 the one molecule of the hydrate, and the hydrogen of only one
 of them is expelled in forming the hydrate 3 and in the terminal
 action, the hydrogen of the other molecule of water is expelled
 bya repetition of the same action between the newly supplied
 sodium and the oxygen of that second molecule.
    Thus also Dr. Graham, in his second volume, p. 514-, states
 with reference to the analogous action between potassium and
 water, “ The representation of water by HHO, as in Gerhardt’s
 system, possesses the additional advantage of corresponding
 with the important fact that it is possible to replace either the
 half or the whole of the hydrogen in* water by a metal. Thus
 potassium thrown into water displaces half the hydrogen and
 forms hydrate of potash, HK9; and when this compound, in
 the solid state, is heated with an additional quantity of potas
 sium, the remaining half of the hydrogen is displaced, and
 anhydrous potash, KK9, is formed.         On the contrary, when
potassium acts on hydrochloric acid, HCI, it displaces the whole
of the hydrogen and forms chloride of potassium, KCI. This is
an important difference, which is easily understood on the sup
position that water contains two atoms, and hydrochloric acid
only one atom of hydrogen; whereas if these two compounds
are represented by the analogous formulae HO and HG], the cause
of the difference of action is by no means apparent.” The am
biguity here is caused by Gerhardt’s symbols actually represent
ing two gaseous molecules ; but they are not distinctly recognized
as having this meaning either by Mr. Odling or Dr. Graham, as
the following shows. In the above extract HKO represents one
molecule of the hydrate of potash, but HHO represents two mole
cules of water, and KKO two molecules of anhydrous potash. The
actions expressed by the fractional system of notation (submitted
       * Here is an ambiguity. Is one molecule meant, or two?

254        Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation in
as the only system mathematically conformable to the law of
volumes) is as follows :-—Potassinm, K, in contact with water,

result being KO‘l, KO‘l. The <U+FB01>rst is a double act of combina
tion, forming one molecule out of three. The second is 8 case
of resolution by preponderating a<U+FB02>inity.
   With reference to chloride of potassium: when potassa,
KOi 110*, or Kos is presented to Hi 01*, 11% 01* in water, the
(Ti in one molecule of the oxide unites with the two Hi of two
molecules of the acid to form water.(no hydrogen is evolved), and
the two Cli of the same two molecules of acid unite with the K,
forming KCI, the chloride of potassium.

H‘} of two molecules of the acid to form H (which is evolved), and
the two Cll unite with K to form KCI.         Lastly, potassium, K,
in chlorine, Cl, takes <U+FB01>re and burns into Kill.
    After discussing several cases of substitution and of chemical
parallels as arguments adduced “to show that the molecular
weight of water is 18, corresponding to the formula H2 O", and
not 9, corresponding to the formula HO’, Mr. Odling makes the
following remark :—“ In addition to the above-mentioned che
mical parallel, there is one very remarkable physical relation
subsisting between marsh-gas, ammonia, water, and h drochloric
acid, namel that all four molecules occupy the same ulk. Two
cubic feet, or instance, of hydrochloric acid gas, HCI, yield one
 cubic foot of hydrogen and one cubic foot of chlorine. Two
 cubic feet of steam, H"1 0, yield two cubic feet of hydrogen and
 one cubic foot of oxygen, 8:0.” The meaning is apparently that
 the symbols attached to the letters express the number of volumes
 of the constituent gases in two volumes of the compounds. That
 this should be noticed as “ a very remarkable physical relation ”
 at once indicates that the mode of notation, although it is founded
 on the law of volumes, is nevertheless defective. All molecules,
 simple or compound, in the gaseous state, occupy the same
 bulk. This the dynamic theory proclaims as a fact. Let the
 notation be founded thereupon, and we obtain, expressed with
 perfect conciseness, at once the chemical composition, the phy
 sical density of aunit volume, and the constitution of a molecule.
 The analytical chemist may object to the introduction of fractional
exponents, from the preconceived notion that a gaseous molecule
is with more propriety to be viewed as a combination of two or

   conformity with the Dynamical Theory ofHeat and Gases.      255
 more chemical indestructible atoms than that such primary atom
 is a fraction of a gaseous molecule; but if this feeling can be
 overcome, the advantage obtained would, I believe, fully repay
 the effort. To the mathematical student of thermo-molecular
 physics, there is as distinct evidence of the gaseous molecule of
 oxygen splitting into_ two equal parts when combining with hy
 drogen to form water, as there is to the astronomer of any of the
 results of the law of gravitation. When, besides expressing uch
 facts, the vapour-molecule system of exponents is also so much
 more comprehensive in the information it affords, surely an im
 partial and deliberate consideration of the question cannot fail to
 have its in<U+FB02>uence.
    I have before me a Table of nearly two hundred gases and
 vapours whose densities have been experimentally ascertained, all
 expressed in this way. Each symbol or formula expresses the
 actual constitution of the gas-molecule in terms of the gas-mole
 cules of its constituents, or, in other words, each expresses the
 constitution of a unit volume of the body in a state of vapour in
 terms of the unit volume of its constituents ; also the equivalent
 weight by adding up the value of the symbols, Thus sulphurous
 acid, OS%= 16+ 9?? =32, which is the vapour-density and also
the equivalent. Muriatic acid, C15‘ H5‘: 18 +3}: 18%, which is
the vapour-density, but only one-half of the equivalent usually
given.
    The mixing up of single and double numbers in tables of
equivalents, which still continues in works of authority, seems
prejudicial to advancement in theoretical chemistr . For example,
if the individuality of the molecule were properly kept in view,
alcohol could never have been viewed as the hydrate of oxide of
ethyle in a system of notation like that of Gerhardt’s, which
professes to recognize equal number of atoms in equal volumes,-—
the fact being that two vapour-molecules of alcohol contain the
same elements as one vapour-molecule of ether plus one vapour
molecule of water. If the system recognizes only the simple gases
as having the same number of atoms in equal volumes, and the
compounds as having varying multiples of these according to
what is termed their “rational formula,” then in a cubic foot
which contains n number of atoms of oxygen there is %n number
of ether-atoms as the greatest number possible; because if the
number were n, each atom of ether would contain half an atom
of oxygen (4), which is inadmissible, as an atom applies to the
least combining element. In a cubic foot of alcohol vapour,
considered as the hydrate of ether, there cannot be more than
half the number of atoms that ether has, or in, for the same
reason in respect to the atom of oxygen.      On the other hand, if

 256        Mr. J. J. \Vaterston on Chemical Notation in
 a cubic foot of the vapours of ether, of alcohol, and of all other
 compounds of oxygen and other bodies, simple or composite,
 contains ‘n number of atoms or smallest parts of the respective
 compounds, then must a cubic foot of oxygen contain n atoms :
 or giving to the ultimate moving part of a gas or vapour the
 name molecule, wc <U+FB01>nd that in all compounds containing oxygen
 the atom of each corresponds to the molecule, and has the same

 the equivalent weight by the speci<U+FB01>c gravity, we have to make
 an exception to this in the case of the primaries, and de<U+FB01>ne their
 gaseous volume as being the quotient of twice the equivalent
 weight by the speci<U+FB01>c gravity; but it would be better to substi
 tute the word molecule for volume, as the theory of heat and
 gases which attributes to the ultimate separate part, whatever
 its weight or constitution, a constant volume, because of the vis
 viva with which it is charged, seems to be favourably received by
 professional chemists (Graham, vol. ii.).
    With respect to ethyle, &c., and the “rational formulae” in
which they enter, some further remarks seem necessary, as the
 existence of such radicals is incompatible with the dynamical
 theory. In the ‘English Cyclopaedia,’ art. “Chemical Formulae,”
the fotllowing ('>;i:1cui'sh:—l-‘<U+FB02>flltlhformiillae 211I‘6 partial becapse fillz<U+FB01>y
 canno express e w o e o              e mo ecu ar arrangemen s o               e
bodies to which they refer, and arbitrary because they cannot
but give undue prominence to particular theoretical views and
tendencies.”     In Graham’s second volume, p. 521, it is stated
that “the rational formula of a compound is inferred from its
modes of formation and decomposition.” Such mode applied to
alcohol would de<U+FB01>ne it as a hydrate of ole<U+FB01>ant gas. At p. 522
the following occurs :—“ It appears, then, that the same com
  ound ma have several rational formulae. . . . . . The greater
the numbei of elementary atoms entering into the constitution
of a compound, the more numerous will be the possible arrange
ments of those atoms, and the greater therefore the number of
rational formula which may be assigned to the compound.” It
thus appears that rational formulae are as yet little better than
possible arrangements, and the insu<U+FB01>iciency of the chemical evi
dence to determine one in preference to another is admitted. To
those who consider the truth in nature as of paramount import
ance, here is a motive for seeking evidence in departments not
strictlychemical, more especially since the discovery of the alcohol
mixed metals, and of hydrocarbons having the constitution of
ethyle and methyle, seem to be regarded as settling the point in
favour of the modern theory.

bined with half a gas-molecule of hydrogen; or it has nothing
to do with ethyle, but is a primary hydrocarbon isomeric if not
identical with methyle. Marsh-gas, called hydride of methyle,
has its molecule composed of haif a gas-molecule of methyle
united with half a gas-molecule of hydrogen; or it has nothing
to do with methyle, but is a primary hydrocarbon.
   Zincethyle has vapour-density 61'5, showing that a vapour
molecule is composed of 32'5 zinc, 24 carbon, and 5 hydrogen.
If it is a primary compound of one molecule zinc with one of
ethyle, the combining a<U+FB02>inity of the elements for oxygen must
in consequence be much exalted, because it takes <U+FB01>re instantly
on coming in contact with the air.        Or it may be viewed as a
secondary compound of a metallic hydride with etherine. There
is at least one metallic hydride, the hydride of copper, which
presents the same exaltation of a<U+FB01>inity in respect to chlorine.
Its composition is 1 hydrogen to 64 copper, or 5 to 32, which
gives the formula H5‘ Cu. When treated with muriatic acid,
01% Hit, the 11* of the cupride unites with the at of the acid to
form H, which is the hydrogen evolved, and the Cu unites with
the C15 to form the dichloride of copper, C15 Cu. This action is
stated to be very remarkable (Graham, vol. ii. p. 96), inasmuch
as metallic copper is scarcely acted on by muriatic acid ; i. e. Cu
and H% Cli are passive, while Cu Hi and Cl% Hii are intensely
active. At p. 517 there is the following remark :—“To reduce
these bodies (viz. the elementary) to the same standard, it is
necessary to assume that each molecule of an elementary body
in the free state consists of two elementary atoms.” And at
p. 517, “It appears indeed as if [such] atoms could not exist in
a state of isolation.   An atom [i. e. Oi‘, H5", Cli, &c.] of an ele
mentary body must unite either with an atom of another element or
with one of its own kind.” We thus may see the propriety in
every way of viewing them and expressing them as fractions of
a molecule: with such symbols the peculiar action of the hydride
of copper on muriatic acid no longer appears remarkable.
   In the case of zincethyle, considered as composed of a hydro-_
carbon C2 H4 (etherine) and a metallic hydride, the latter must
be Zn combined with H, a whole gas-molecule of hydrogen.
The action on being presented to the atmosphere is ZnH pre
sented to O of the atmosphere, i. e. to whole gas-molecules of oxy
geu—causing, with their exalted a<U+FB02>inity, the division 0% 0'1‘, one
of which burns with Zn, forming the protoxide of zinc, ZnO’i;
the other burning with H to form water, H0}.
   The apparent exaltation of af<U+FB01>nity in these and other similar
cases may be caused simply by the atoms of metal existing un

   On theLength ofWaves ofcertain brightLines in the Spectrum. 259
  fettered by cohesion, the integral of which bears comparison with
  the more intense of the chemical forces. The H in its connexion
  with the metal may be compared to the H in the hydrocarburet
   Cill, which, being one-half CH’ the ole<U+FB01>ant, and one quarter
  C’ H4 etherine, we may by analogy hold as possible, yet, like a
  metallic hydride, having the a<U+FB01>inity of its constituents for oxygen
  and the other electro-negative elements too exalted to exist in a
  state to be recognized. In pyroxylic spirit it appears combined
  with water, C‘!I H . HO‘l; in chloride of methyle, Ci HCI, com
  bined with chlorine, &c.                          -
      However this may be, it cannot be disputed that chemical
  elements unite in modes that, estimated dynamically, are speci
 <U+FB01>cally distinct. Besides those above noted, there seems to be
 another, as in the case of chloride of nitrogen, where not only
 force, but heat and light accompany the disunion of elements
 —-is evolved instead of being absorbed. In the usual case, force
  or heat causes the separation; in the fulminate, the separation
 causes (apparently) force and heat. Such considerations must
 enter into any system of classi<U+FB01>cation of chemical com
 pounds that is not quite arti<U+FB01>cial and arbitrary. To include
 under the same type a liquid of which the elements are in a
 burnt condition, with another the major part of which is in an
 unburnt condition, is simply to ignore the dynamical theory of
 heat, to reject as a guide a principle that has never failed to yield
 rich returns to those who have resigned themselves entirely to
 its guidance in the study of nature.

XXXVI. Determination ofthe Length ofthe Waves of certain bright
     lines in the Spectrum. By Dr. JOHN M1'J'LLEa of Freiberg*
 AS well-divided glass screens offer the simplest and most
          accurate means of ascertaining the length of the waves for
 the differently coloured rays, I have had recourse to an unex
 ceptionably perfect screen that I recently obtained from Nobert,
 of Barth in Pomerania, to determine the length of the wave of
the red lithium line (Li at), the yellow sodium line (Na ac), and
the blue strontium line (Sr 8). This screen had 2001 lines in
the width of 4- Paris lines; the distance from the middle of one
line to the middle of the following one, a magnitude which we
shall designate by b, amounted to 0'”'OO2.         It was so placed on
the centre stage of a small goniometer of Babinet’s construction,
that its plane was at right angles to the axis of the telescope
provided with the slit.       A small gas-lamp was then placed in
    * Translated from Poggendor<U+FB01>"s Annalen, vol. cxviii. p. 641, and com

 260     Dr. J. Miiller on the Determination of the Length of
 front of the slit, and the <U+FB02>ame thereof was coloured red by means
  of lithium.
     The telescope was now so directed that the cross-lines were
 brought to bear on the red lithium line of the <U+FB01>rst spectrum to
 the left, and then on the red lithium line of the <U+FB01>rst spectrum
  to the right, the reading of each of these positions being taken.
     Designating the red lithium line of the <U+FB01>rst side-spectrum by
  Li a 1, the position of the nonius was for
                             Lia 1 right, 72° 41',
                             Lia 1 left,     55° 28' ;
  consequently the angle of deviation of each of the red bands
 Li a 1 from the centre of the image of in<U+FB02>ection gives .r=8°_36"5.
     For the length of wave, 7», of the red lithium light we obtain
            7t = b sin .1.‘ = 0002 . 0149679 = O'”'00029936.
     The deviation of the red lithium band Li :12 from the centre
 of the in<U+FB02>ection-image was measured in the same manner, and
 its value, y, was found to be =17° 27''5. In conformity there
 with, the length of wave of the red lithium light is ascertained
 to be
         7\.=b
                sin 9 =0-002 sin (17° 27"5)- =0-00030000.
                  2                        2
    As a mean of these two measures, we therefore obtain as the
 length of wave of Li a the value
                            7t= 0'”'0002997,
 or
                            7» = 00006733 millimetre.
    A similar measure was next carried out for the yellow sodium

   From Fraunhofer’s measures we obtain for the dark line D of the
solar spectrum, which, as we know, coincides with Na 0:, a length
of wave of 00005888 millim. The result of my measures agrees
therefore satisfactorily with those of Fraunhofer, when one takes
into consideration that the division on the goniometer does not
admit of an accurate reading of less than 1 minute.           The result
arrived at by me differs from that of Fraunhofer by about § per
cent., and the extreme values obtained by Fraunhofer himself
differ by §- per cent.

  The setting the instrument on the blue strontium line involved
  some difficulty, owing to its little intensity.
     The attempt to determine in the same manner the length of
  wave of the two potassium lines was not successful, because they
  were too weak even to be seen at all.                    -
     To this communication I subjoin the remark that the bright
 spectrum-lines of certain coloured <U+FB02>ames appear very appropriate
 for determining the index of refraction of various substances for
 the di<U+FB02>erently coloured rays.         Hitherto, as we know, Fraunho
 fer’s lines A, B, U, D, E, F, G, and H have been employed for
 this purpose.
     The observation of the bright spectral lines of coloured <U+FB02>ames
 is at all events easier of application, and may be had recourse to
 at any time, whereas the employment of Fraunhofer’s lines is
 dependent on the weather, and requires a suitable locality. As
 long ago as 1859, Pliicker suggested for the determination of
 the index of refraction the employment of the three bright lines
 obtained by the passage of the spark from a Ruhmkor<U+FB01>"s coil
 through rare<U+FB01>ed hydrogen, instead of Fraunhofer’s lines. And
 Landolt has already carried this into effect with respect to a series
 of different <U+FB02>uids (Poggendor<U+FB01>"s Annalen, vol. cxvii.). But it is
 even yet simpler and less troublesome to make use of a Bunsen’s
 burner than to put a Ruhmkor<U+FB02>"s coil in action. The lines best
 suited for the end in view would probably be
                The red potassium line        .   . Ka a.
                The red lithium line . .          . Li a.

                The violet potassium line.       .  Ka B.
To which might probably be added the green thallium line when
this metal shall have become somewhat more accessible. All
these lines, owing to their great distinctness, are very suitable
for accurate determinations.

above notices the length of wave of the green thallium line.

        GENTLEMEN,
       AVING been asked to give an opinion, on theoretical
           grounds, regarding the stability of a bridge about to be
 erected in this country, I calculated some formulae, which, as I
 have not seen the subject treated in this way anywhere else, I
 think may be of use to some of your readers.

     1. Suppose a load, L (<U+FB01>g. 1), to be placed on the bridge over the
 arch, and not in the centre. B is the point of the extrados under
 the middle of the load. Draw BAX, BCD, DEY tangents to the
intrados. Imagine the arch at the points A, B, C, D, E to be
 divided into four parts, and to be forcibly held in the position
 shown in the diagram, in which the arch is slightly open at
joints through those points. If the equilibrium of the arch is
 stable, the parts will fall back into their places when left to
themselves ; if unstable, the arch will fall.
     Let W1, W2, W3, W4 be the weights of these four portions of
the arch, including the total load each carries (not omitting L).

   I have kept a, and as general that I might obtain these equa
tions by di<U+FB01>'erentiation. Now consider them equal, and obtain
8:», and San, in terms of 50:, and 5a,, by these equations. Mul
tiply the <U+FB01>rst by cos 0:, or cos a3, and the second by sina, or

Again, multiply the two equations by cos 0:4, sin a4, and add; then

            Archdeacon Pratt on the Stability of Arches.         265
 In the <U+FB01>rst case the arch will be stable, because the slight dis
 placement raises the centre of gravity ,- and as this will fall, the
 openings will close up again when the arch is left to itself. _ In
 the latter case the centre of v"gravity descends, owing to the dis
 placement of the parts of the arch, and will go on descending
 when the arch is left to itself, and therefore the arch will fall.
    When any design of an arch is determined upon, it is an easy
 matter to take different portions of the load L and <U+FB01>nd all the
 quantities involved in the above formula by construction and
 measurement by a scale; and the character of the proposed arch
 for stability can be determined in this way.                '

Putting these in the above formula of comparison, the two sides
 are 7'65 and 7'89. The <U+FB01>rst is less than the second, and there
fore the arch would be in itself stable. Now introduce L, and
 suppose the centre of gravity to be over B, and half added to WI
and half to W2. Then the two sides of the comparison are
                      7'65 +O'75 L and 7'89,
and therefore the arch will be at its limit between stability and
instability when L=O'32, or about 7nth part of the weight of
the whole bridge. Practical men must decide whether this would
be safe.

 XXXVIII. On the Products of the Combustion of Gun-cotton and
     Gunpowder under circumstances analogous to those which occur
    in practice. By L. v. KAROLYI*.
       HE gun-cotton manufactured according to Major-General
          Freiherr von Lenk’s method at Hirtenberg near Wiener
 Neustadt, has, in consequence of special previous experiments,
 been used by the Genie Corps for mining-purposes ; and not
 withstanding the fact that there are still numerous dit<U+FB01>culties in
 the way of its use for gun-charges, it is also used by the Royal
 Imperial Artillery for hollow projectiles.
    The <U+FB01>rst-mentioned use led the Genie Committee, to which I
 belong, to cause experiments to be made which are calculated to
 give greater insight into the chemical deportment of this sub~
 stance. Among these is the attempt to ascertain the products
 of combustion of the gun-cotton produced in Hirtenberg; and in
   * Translated from Poggendorfs Annalen, April 1868, by Dr. Atkinson,

the course of the investigation it seemed advisable to extend the
method 1 used to gunpowder.
    1. Analysis of the Products of Combustion of Gun-cotton.
   The rapid de<U+FB02>agration of gun-cotton, and its necessary accom
paniment, the bursting action, prevented me from using in the
analysis of the products of combustion the excellent method
which Professor Bunsen* devised, for obtaining the combustion
products of gunpowder for the purpose of analysis. It was ne
cessary to effect the combustion in vacuo, and for this purpose I
used a eudiometer about a metre in length, in which, instead of
two wires, as in the ordinary eudiometer, a single very thin pla
tinum wire was drawn ‘across. To this from 15 to 20 milli
grammes of gun-cotton were af<U+FB01>xed, the tube <U+FB01>lled with mercury,
and the Torricellian vacuum produced in the usual manner. By
means of a galvanic battery the wire could be ignited, and hence
the gun-cotton exploded ; thereupon all eudiometrical operations
were carried out in the-tube in the usual manner, after a preli
nary experiment had shown that the gas produced in this manner
consisted of nitrogen, binoxide of nitrogen, carbonic acid, car
bonic oxide, marsh-gas, and aqueous vapour.                     Vol.

  The gun-cotton used had the average composition CQ‘H‘7N5O3“,
from which, after subtracting the results of the analysis, the
separated carbon is obtained which is included in the above
analysis.
    This simple and apparently faultless method has repeatedly
shown that, by using a somewhat large quantity of gun-cotton
under the same circumstances, when therefore the combustion
takes place under comparatively greater pressure, the quantities
of‘ the products of combustion change, and the quantity of bin
oxide of nitrogen diminishes as the pressure increases. Hence
the deoxidation of nitrogen-compounds during the combustion
takes place the more completely the greater the work which the
gun-cotton has to perform during its combustion.
    This circumstance suggested to me the idea of exposing the
gun-cotton during its combustion to a determinate resistance,
and regulated so that it just gives way at the moment gun-cotton
is completely burnt away. This condition led me to the experi
ment of placing a vessel <U+FB01>lled with gun-cotton which offered the
necessary resistance, in a 60-pound mortar, which was then ex
hausted and the gun-cotton exploded by galvanism.
     The detailed plan of this apparatus is seen from the
diagram. In the touchhole of the mortar a strong iron nut, 11,
is screwed, which by the aid of a good stutfer, e, enables the
mortar to be made air-tight. The screw is provided at b with a
short tube closed by a cock, by which the vacuum is obtained in
the subsequent operations. At cl’ a copper wire, well insulated
by gutta percha, passes through the nut, while at d is a small
hook; to this and to the insulated copper wire the vessels
<U+FB01>lled with the gun-cotton intended for explosion are <U+FB01>xed, and,
as the <U+FB01>gure shows, allow the ignition of the charge to be effected.
In the experiment the mortar is exhausted, the tap closed, and the
platinum wire in the charge ignited by the current from six
Smee’s elements, and thus the vessel burst.      It is readily seen

           the Combustion of Gun-'cott0n' and Gunpowder.        269
 that in this way it is possible not only to burn the gun-cotton
 under different resistances, but also to obtain the resultant gases
 free from atmospheric air.
   The resistance of the explosion-vessels must be so chosen that
the gas in the mortar, after explosion, has an excess of pressure of
half an atmosphere, in order that it may subsequently be trans
ferred to the measuring-vessels.
   The explosion-vessels which I used were made according to
the directions of the late Lieut.-Colonel Ebner, and consisted of
hollow cast-iron cylinders closed at one end, while at the other
was a nut through which the arrangement for a galvanic explo
sion passes. For this purpose the nut is provided with an exca
vatiou in which isa thin platinum wire fastened on the one hand
to the insulated copper wire, and on the other to the copper wire
which passes directly through the nut. . Outside the cover the_

270                M. L. v. Karolyi on the Product: of
 wires are bent into knots, which, as previously mentioned, serve
 to support the cylinders and to complete the voltaic circuit.
    The weight of the gun-cotton whose gases shall <U+FB01>ll the ex
hausted mortar of 5216 cubic centims. contents so that there shall
 be the tension above mentioned, I have empirically determined,
 and <U+FB01>nd that it is 10 grms. The fact that 10 grms. of
 cotton somewhat compressed occupy a space of 105 centimetres
 in length and 2 centimetres in diameter, determined the internal
 dimensions of the cylinder. The thickness of the sides of the
 cylinder was also obtained from an empirical experiment, which
 showed that with a thickness of 8 millims. the cylinder just ex
 ploded with production of flame, and that thus, in accordance
 with the condition stated, the gun-cotton burnt away the moment
 the cylinder burst. I must here mention a peculiar circumstance
 which attracted my attention in determining the thickness of the
 side of the cylinder, and which serves to characterize gun-cotton.
 For the above investigation I successively <U+FB01>lled with gun-cotton
 cylinders -41-, 6, and 8 millims. thick in the side and exploded
 them in a hole.      Although the cylinders of 4 and 6 millims.
in thickness contained comparatively a larger charge, the pieces
produced were considerably larger than those of the cylinders 8
millims. in thickness. The former were often only split length
 wise; their cover and bottom remained unchanged, while the
pieces of the cylinder of 8 millims. in thickness were scarcely
larger than hazel-nuts.
    The above bursting vessels might also probably be constructed
 of glass. Very strong thick glass tubes are taken, and at each
 end corks cemented in, one of which has been provided with a
galvanic conduction and the small platinumwire. The length
of the vessels and the thickness of their sides could then be regu
lated by the quantity of gas and the desired resistance.
    The qualitative analysis of the products of the combustion of
 gun-cotton under the circumstances described gave carbonic
 oxide, carbonic acid, nitrogen, marsh-gas, and a trace of a sul
phurous gas (probably abisulphide of carbon compound), which,
from its small quantity, escaped analysis and could only be
detected by the smell. This probably arises from a small trace
of sulphuric acid adhering to the gun-cotton, which either was
not removed in washing, or by subsequent treatment with pot
ash remained as sulphate.

   As previously mentioned, the bursting vessels were <U+FB01>lled with
10 grammes of cotton, which, by an accurate measurement, was
found to yield a quantity of gas of 5740 cubic centims. at 0°.
and 1 metre pressure. The contents of the mortar at 16° and
07382 metre pressure amounts to 5292 cubic centims.; the
quantitity of gas issuing at this pressure amounted to 2939 cubic
centims. ; hence 10 grms. gun-cotton yielded 8231 cubic cen
tims. at 16° and 07382 metre pressure. If the quantity of gas

  272            M. L. v. Karolyi on the Products of
  is calculated from the results of the analysis, it is found that
  10 grms. of gun-cotton yield 57642 of gases, which su<U+FB01>iciently
  agrees with the quantity actually found.
     Comparing the results of the above-described analysis with
  those of the analysis in the Torricellian vacuum, it is found
     (1) That the gases in both cases are combustible from the
  large quantity of carbonic oxide they contain.
     (2) That the gases produced in vacuo contain a considerable
  quantity of binoxide of nitrogen, while by burning gun-cotton
  under appropriate resistance, the nitrogen compounds are deoxi
  dized in favour of the carbon in marsh-gas and of the hydrogen,
  by which an increase in the carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, water,
  and a separation of free hydrogen are caused. Hence it follows
 that the red gun-cotton vapours can never occur if the entire
 gun-cotton is burnt away at the moment in which it begins to
 overcome the resistance offered to it.
     These facts have a practical application in the use of gun
 cotton to mining purposes.
     II. Analysis of the Products of Combustion of Gunpowder.
    After <U+FB01>nding that the combustion of gun-cotton under cir
 cumstances resembling those which occur in mines is of decisive
 in<U+FB02>uence on the products evolved, it apeared desirable to inves
 tigate the combustion of gunpowder under similar circumstances.
 Unfortunately, since my investigations had a speci<U+FB01>cally military
 object, I could only analyse the Austrian small-arms and ord
 nance powder; hence only a super<U+FB01>cial comparison can be insti
 tuted with the results which Prof. Bunsen obtained with freely
 burning sporting-powder.
    The combustion of the gunpowder was effected in the ex
 hausted mortar in the same way as the combustion of the gun
 cotton, with the exception that, on account of the smaller
action of the powder, and in order to obtain as large a quantity
of gas, the exploding vessels had to be larger, but with thinner
sides than those in which the gun-cotton was exploded. The
excavation in the cores was <U+FB01>lled with meal powder.
    The composition of the two kinds of powder used for investi
gation are obtained from the following analyses.
    Ordnance Powder.-4-5487 grms. gave 3'3562 grms. saltpetre
and 1'l923 grin. of a residue insoluble in water. Bisulphide of
carbon dissolved 05823 sulphur. The remainder was charcoal.
    Small-arms Powder.—8'8653 grms. contained 6'8408 salt
petrc: the residue of 20245 grms. contained 0765 grm.
sulphur, and there remained 1'2595 grin. of charcoal. The
organic analysis of the charcoal, carefully freed from sulphur,
gave—

 274             M. L. v. Karolyi on the Products of *
 For the qualitative analysis of the products of combustion, two
 cylinders were <U+FB01>lled with the two kinds of powder, made air
 tight, and successively exploded in the mortar in the manner
 described.                      _  _  _                         _
    For both kinds there were found in the solid residue :—(1)
 sulphate of potash, (2) carbonate of potash, (3) hyposulphite
 of potash, (4) sesquicarbonate of ammonia, (5) sulphur, (6)
 charcoal, (7) sulphide of potassium. The latter, in the case of
 the small-arms powder, was only formed in very small quan
 tities.                                            _
    The gaseous products of‘ combustion were (1) nitrogen, (2)
 carbonic acid, (3) carbonic oxide, (4) hydrogen, (5) sulphuretted
 hydrogen, (6) marsh-gas, and a very‘ small quantity of a bisul
 phide of carbon compound,'which was distinctly recognized by
 its odour as being that produced in the gases from gun-cot
 ton. The whole mixture is colourless, and contains no fume or
 vapour.
                          (a_) Ordnance Powder.
    For the quantitative determination of the products of combus
 tion, 36'8366 grins. were used.
     The gas passed into three absorption-tubes amounted to
 753 cubic centims. ; the gas issuing from the mortar until the
 rest was under the atmospheric pressure amounted to 54807
 cubic centims. at 16°. C. and 05749 metre pressure; under these
 circumstances the mortar holds 5216 cubic centims. ; hence the
 above quantity yielded 7621'96 cubic centims. gas at 0° and
 1 metre pressure.
    The absorption-analysis produced—-                      V01, at 0°
                                                             andlm.

From the estimation of the potash-bulb with iodine solution, it
followed that the sulphuretted hydrogen corresponded to 044
division. Hence the above gas consisted of 0'44 vol. sulphu

    By applying the formulae of the gasometric methods already‘
 mentioned iii the analysis of gun-cotton, since the gases are
 qualitatively the same, the values are obtained, for carbonic
 oxide =5'2], hydrogen =3'O3, marsh-gas =1"-38, and nitro
 gen =19'18.
    Hence the total gas calculated for 100 parts consisted of-
                 42'74  vols.  Carbonic acid
                  0'86   ,,    Sulphuretted hydrogen

   The determination of the solid residue in the mortar was
effected, after removing the gases, b digestion with water, which
was drawn off through a tap in the ottom and rapidly <U+FB01>ltered.
   The results of the analyses were as follows :—
   1. Sulphide of Potassium.-—The entire <U+FB01>ltered liquid was
digested in three large boiling <U+FB02>asks with well-ignited oxide of
copper, thereupon <U+FB01>ltered, and the residue dissolved in fuming
nitric acid. Treated with nitrate of baryta, it gave O'1015 grm.
of sulphate of baryta, which corresponds to 00478 grm. sulphide
of potassium in the residue of 368366 grms. powder.
   The liquid <U+FB01>ltered from the oxide of copper was made up to
6 litres for the sake of further investigation.
   2. Carbonic Acizt.——A litre of this liquid gave with nitrate of
silver a precipitate of carbonate and sulphide of silver. Treated
with ammonia, the carbonate dissolved, and was separated from
sulphide by a weighed <U+FB01>lter, and precipitated in the <U+FB01>ltrate as
chloride of silver by means of hydrochloric acid. Its weight
amounted to 30475 grms., which corresponds to 04687 grm.
combined carbonic acid; hence in the entire residue there were
2'8126 grins. combined carbonic acid.
   As a control, the carbonic acid was determined by chloride of

manganese by mixinga litre of the liquid with a solution of this
salt which had been previously fused; aprecipitate of carbonate
of manganese was obtained, the carbonic acid of which, deter
mined in the usual manner, corresponded to 28337 grms. in
the entire residue.
   3. Hyposulphite ofPotash.--The sulphide of silver (2) weighed
on the tared <U+FB01>lter, when dried at 120°, 0'2?-61 grm., which cor
responds to 01733 grm. hyposulphite of potash ; hence the entire
residue contained 1'0400 grm. hyposulphite of potash.
   A determination of the hyposulphite was also made by metrical
analysis. A litre of the solution was acidulated with acetic acid,
mixed with starch, and determined by means of a standard solu
tion of iodine.   A litre required 225?’ cubic centims. iodine
                                                 2 KO, S2 O2
solution ; hence, according to the formula s=c¢
                                                 —1_ =”
in which t=22'57', a=O'OOO5l7; this litre contained 01746
grm. hyposulphite of _potasb, and the entire residue 1'O476 grm.
of this salt.
   4. Sesquicarbonate of Ammonia.—According to Bunsenis
method, a litre of the liquid was boiled with caustic potash, the
distillate passed into a solution of hydrochloric acid of known
strength, and the hydrochloric acid which had not been changed
to chloride of ammonium determined with a standard ammonia
solution. I found a=O‘O4.<853, the quantity of hydrochloric
acid taken; t=19'87, the number of divisions of an ammoniacal
liquid which would have saturated a volume of hydrochloric
acid equal to that taken with t'=4.-1'30 divisions of the burette.
                        2NH4 O, 3 CO‘2 u(t'—t)
Using the formula .z"=                          , I found in the

ilitre the sesquicarbonate of ammonia to he 0041275 grm.;
hence 09908 grm. corresponds to the entire quantity of sesqui
carbonate of ammonia.
   5. Carbonate of Potash.—Subtracting the carbonic acid in the
sesquicarbonate of ammonia =O'5541 grm. from the total quan
tity found (2), =2'8337 grms., there remains a quantity corre
sponding to the carbonate of potash =2'2796 grms. Hence the
entire residue contains 7'1498 grms. carbonate of potash.
   6. Sulphate ofPotash.—-A litre of the liquid mixed with chlo
ride of barium gave 3024.4 grms. sulphate of baryta, which cor
responds to 22683 grms. sulphate of potash for one litre of
liquid, and l3'6lOO grms. for the whole residue.
   7. Potash.-—To determine the entire quantity of potash con
tained iu the various salts, a litre of the liquid was carefully
evaporated to dryness with sulphuric acid and ignited in a pla
tinum vessel.    3'8466 grms. of sulphate of potash were thus

            the Combustion of Gun-cotton and Gunpowder.            277
  obtained, corresponding to 20786 grms. of potash. Hence 100
  grms. of ordnance powder contain 33'85 grms. of potash, which
  agrees closely with the result of the direct analysis of the powder.
 After <U+FB01>nding, by direct observation, that 36'8366 grms. of the
 powder furnished 7621'9 cubic centims. of gas, the composition
 pfuthe products of combustion of this powder may be stated as

 280     Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
    A comparison of these results shows at <U+FB01>rst sight that, on the
 whole, the products of combustion of powder are little dependent
 on the manner in which the combustion takes place. But that the
 composition of the powder has a great in<U+FB02>uence, is seen from
 the fact that in Bunsen’s powder, which contains much nitre,
 nearly 4 per cent. of this substance are found in the residue ;
 while, on the other hand, in the residue of the ordnance powder,
which contains less nitre, almost 7 per cent. of sulphur and
 charcoal are separated unburnt. The in<U+FB02>uence of the compo
 sition on the nature of the products of combustion is still more
surprising. Where the reducing body preponderates, the com
bustion of the carbon is more imperfect. Whereas the gases
 of sporting-powder only contain 3 per cent. of carbonic oxide,
the gas from ordnance powder contains nearly 10 per cent. The
quantity of hydrogen and of marsh-gas increase in the same
direction, so that the ordnance-powder gas contains nearly
20 per cent. of combustible gases. Hence it is not surprising
that the gases of ordnance powder, as well as those of gun-cotton,
may be ignited, as direct experiment showed, by a glimmering
piece of wood.                          .
    There might apparently be no difficulty, from the results of
these analyses, in arriving at aright composition of powder; yet
in this respect practice prefers its own empirical path. But in
 any case the results obtained serve as an additional proof of the
inaccuracy of the view which prevails in many chemical text
books and in almost all artillery institutions,—that powder must
decompose, in burning, into sulphide of potassium, carbonic acid,
and nitrogen. If practice has no other reason for the composi
tion of powder than the possibility that these products may occur,
it is certainly allowable to attempt to prove experimentally that

      XXXIX. On N-ewton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
          By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
    N the Third Book of the Principia, under the head of “ Regula
       Tertia Philosophandi,” Newton concludes the statement of
certain views respecting the ultimate qualities of bodies by say
ing, “ Et hoe est fundamentum philosophia: totius.”      An asser
tion of this kind, coming from such an authority, and made so
emphatically, may well excite an inquiry as to what is its precise
                  * Communicated by the Author.

 Prof. Challis on 'Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”     281
 meaning, and how far it can be accepted as true. I will state
 at once that I have been induced to enter upon this inquiry
 because it will give occasion for discussing the characteristics
 and mutual relations of the theoretical and experimental depart
 ments of natural philosophy,——a discussion which the existing
 state of physical science urgently demands, much confusion of
 thought prevailing as to the principles, objects, and limits of the
 two departments, and in particular as to what is fundamental
 in theoretical research. If in consequence of the inquiry I should
 be led to criticise somewhat freely certain views of my contem
 poraries, I trust that I shall be considered to be in<U+FB02>uenced by
 no other personal feeling than the very natural desire to gain
 acceptance for the mathematical principles of natural philosophy
 which I have now for a long time urged on the attention of
 mathematicians, and which I consider to be indispensable to the
 progress of theoretical physics. I have reason to say that the
 physical theories I have proposed have not received the atten
 tion which is requisite for forming a judgment on their merits,
 chie<U+FB02>y because the minds of physicists are prepossessed with a.
 totally different order of ideas, of comparatively recent growth,
 resting on arbitrary hypotheses, and having no reference to what,
 according to Newton, is the foundation of philosophy. This
 being the case, no course is left me but that of exposing the
insecurity of the opposite views.
    The dictum of Newton above quoted is preceded by an enume
 ration of those qualities of bodies which are to be regarded as
“universal,” and which admit of neither increase nor diminu
tion (quae intendi et remitti nequeunt). After premising the
caution that, in regard to such quantities, fancies are not to be
formed (somnia non con<U+FB01>ngcnda), nor the analogy of nature as
gathered from experience to be departed from, he proceeds as
follows :—-“ The extension of bodies is only known by the senses,
nor is it sensibly perceived in all; but because it belongs to all
sensible bodies, it is a<U+FB01>irmed of bodies universally. That various
bodies are hard, we know by experience. But the hardness of
the whole arises from the hardness of the parts ; and hence not
 only of those bodies which are perceived by the senses, but also
of all others, we justly conclude that the undivided particles are
hard. That all bodies are impenetrable we gather, not from
reasoning, but from sensation. Those which we handle are
found to be impenetrable, and thence we conclude that impenetra
bility is a property of all bodies. That all bodies are moveable,
and by a certain force, which we call vis inertia, continue in a
state of motion or rest, we gather from these properties of visible
bodies. The extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and
ris inertia: of the whole arises from the extension, hardness, im

 282 Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
 penetrability, mobility, and vis inertia of the parts; and thence
 we conclude that all the least parts of all bodies are extended,
 hard, impenetrable, moveable, and endued with vis inertia. And
 this is the foundation of all philosophy.”   Now, although there
 is much here to which a modern metaphysician would object,
 and with good reason, the main idea running through the
 whole is undoubtedly true, and of the utmost scienti<U+FB01>c import
 ance, viz. that the experience of the senses relative to masses is
 necessary and sufficient for revealing to us the universal proper
 ties of the ultimate constituents of the masses. This doctrine
 seems to have been very <U+FB01>rmly apprehended in the Newtonian
 epoch of philosophy. Locke has expressed it in more precise
 terms than those of Newton. In the ‘Essay on the Human‘
 Understanding’ (Book 2, Chap. 4, § 1) he says, “The idea of
 solidity we receive by our touch . . . . There is no idea which
 we receive more constantly from sensation than solidity.” Then,
 after saying that he does not object to the term impenetrability,
 but prefers solidity as being in common use to express the same
 idea, he proceeds to say, “ This of all other seems the idea
 most intimately connected with and essential to body ; so as no
 where else to be found or imagined but only in matter. And
 though our senses take no notice of it but in masses of matter
 of a bulk to cause a sensation in us, yet the mind having once
 got this idea from such grosser sensible bodies, traces it further,
 and considers it, as well as <U+FB01>gure, in the minutest particle of
matter that can exist; and <U+FB01>nds it inseparably inherent in body
wherever and however modi<U+FB01>ed.” Again in § 4 he draws a
distinction between solidity and hardness, considering the latter
to consist in a <U+FB01>rm cohesion of parts of matter constituting a
mass susceptible of change of <U+FB01>gure.      According to this de<U+FB01>ni
tion, hardness, as admitting of degrees, cannot be ranked among
Newton’s universal properties susceptible of neither increase not
diminution.     In fact, absolute hardness is not an idea distin
guishable from impenetrability or solidity.
    In the same Regula III. Newton admits that contiguous parts
of bodies are separable, and that undivided parts may in the
applications of mathematical reasoning be conceived to be divi
sible in in<U+FB01>nitum. But he considers it to be uncertain whether
distinct and hitherto undivided parts can be separated by the
forces of nature. This doubt has been removed by the progress
of chemical science, it being found that after any amount of syn
thesis and analysis the properties of the same portion of a sim
ple body remain the same; which is, at least, presumptive
evidence that it consists of parts which do not admit of being
divided by natural forces. Thus the least parts of bodies are
properly called-atoms. There is also another point which expe
                        L_____ .._,_._

   Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”      283
   riment seems to have settled. As the atoms of bodies have ex
   tension, they must necessarily have form ; and the question
   arises, what is their form? Since'_it is found that the movement
   of the parts of a <U+FB02>uid body inter se alters in no manner or
   degree the mutual relations of the parts or the sensible qualities
   of the body, it seems inevitably to follow that each atom has the
   same relation to space and to surrounding atoms in all directions
   from its position, and consequently that its form is spherical.
     Inertia is a universal quality of bodies known from experience to
  belong to masses ; and on the principle that a universal quality of
  masses reveals a universal quality of the constituent atoms, we may
  af<U+FB01>rm that each atom is inert. But this property, which Newton
' calls “vis insita,” and ai<U+FB01>rms to be “ immutabilis,” does not, in
  fact, appear from any sensible evidence to be susceptible of mea
  sure or degree. There may be more or less of inert matter, but
  not more or less of inertia. Accordingly all atoms are of the
  same intrinsic inertia, and differ only in magnitude.
     The fundamental ideas respecting matter, to which the fore
  going discussion leads, may be concisely expressed in the follow
  ing terms :—All matter consists of inert spherical atoms of dif
  ferent, but constant, magnitudes.
     The fundamental ideas respecting force admit of similar inves
  tigation. On this head Newton has said but little, but perhaps
  as much as the state of physical science in his day allowed him
  to say. With respect to the force of gravity, he has left on record
  (in Reg. III.) that he by no means considered it to be “essential
 to bodies,” assigning as the reason for not admitting it to be such,
 that it is mutable as to space, changing with the distance of the
 attracting body. Also in the very last paragraph of the Prin
 cipia he allows of the existence of “ a certain very subtle spirit
 pervading gross bodies and concealed in them ,- by the force and
 agency of which the particles of bodies mutually attract at very
 small distances, and when contiguous, cohere ; and electric bodies
 act at greater distances, both repelling and attracting neigh
 bouring bodies; and light is emitted, re<U+FB02>ected, refracted, in
 <U+FB02>ected; and bodies are warmed; and all sensation is excited,
 and the limbs of animals are moved at will, &c.” But true to
 the principle of deriving fundamental ideas from the indications
 of experience, he refrains from pursuing these views further,
 because “there was not a suf<U+FB01>cient abundance of experiments
 proper for determining and exhibiting the laws of the action of
 this <U+FB02>uid.”       Not only were experiments wanted in Newton’s
 time for such determinations, but the principles of the mathe
 matical reasoning by which those laws might be deduced from
 appropriate experimental data were unknown.
     The case, however, is different in the present state of our

 284 Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
 physical and mathematical knowledge, which allows of taking
 up on fresh grounds the inquiry as to what is fundamental and
 universal in the conception of force. After Newton’s researches
 in physical astronomy had established the fact that masses attract
 each other with forces varying inversely as the square of the
 distance separating them, the attraction of gravity was assumed
 to be an inherent quality of bodies, resident in their minutest
 parts, and acting through space without the intervention of a
 medium. And certainly, on a <U+FB01>rst view, such an inference ap
 pears to be drawn from observation and experience relative to
 masses, just as from the sensible qualities of extension and form
 in masses it is inferred that these same qualities belong to
 atoms.    But that action at a distance is not a universal condi- '
 tion of force is proved by the modern discovery that light and
 heat, which are modes of force, are transmitted through space
 by the intervention of a medium. If one kind of force requires
 a medium of transmission, why not another? Again, it is found
by experience that the same portion of matter may attract or
repel, according to circumstances. But inherent force cannot
possibly be so changed by circumstances; in the same matter it
must continue to be always the same. And in addition to these
reasons for not admitting the idea of inherent force acting at a
distance, the principle of deriving fundamental conceptions from
the indications of the senses furnishes positive argument for a
different idea.    According to that principle, we must, in seeking
for the fundamental idea of force, have regard to the indications
of the sense of touch. Now by this sense we obtain a percep
tion of force as pressure, distinct and unique, and not involving
the variable element of distance which enters into the conception
of force as derived by the sense of sight alone. Hence, according
to such principles as those laid down by Newton in Regula III.,
we cannot do otherwise than conclude that the fundamental idea
of force is pressure.
   But where there is pressure there must be a substance which
presses. Newton, as we have seen, admitted the existence of a
subtle and all-pervading medium, to the action of which he
attributed various dynamical effects. And in recent times even
experimentalists speak familiarly of the 6l’<U+FB02>Z€1‘, designating by
that name a universal elastic <U+FB02>uid. The conception of an aether
is of very ancient date, and the evidence for its reality has been
gradually accumulating up to the present time; but perhaps its
existence is most convincingly indicated by the explanations it
supplies of phenomena of light, and of their analogy in several
respects to phenomena of sound. Apart, however, from these
reasons, drawn from experience and the antecedents of science, the
supposition of a universal aether is demanded by the foregoing

 Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”     285
 \
 a priori conclusion relative to the fundamental idea of force.
 For if all force be in reality pressure, a substance which presses
 must be as universally diffused as force itself. With respect to
 the quality of the pressing body, observation and experience
 leave us no room to doubt that it must be <U+FB02>uid, because,
 assuming its existence, it is matter of experience that all sen
 sible bodies move readily through it. Again, because all known
 <U+FB02>uids press more the more they are compressed, the same
law must be predicated of the tether. We may even assume,
taking experience for guide, that variations of its pressure are
 exactly proportional to variations of the density, there being an
actual instance of this law in air of given temperature. More
over this is the simplest relation conceivable; and in an inves
tigation of the present kind a law less simple than the simplest
is inadmissible. The rule of simplicity is recognized by Newton,
 where he says (Reg. 1.), “ Natura sinlplex est et rerum causis
super<U+FB02>uis non luxllriat ;” and again (Reg. 111.), “ Natura sim
plex esse solet et sibi semper consona.” On the same ground
of simplicity the tether must also be conceived to be always and
everywhere of the same density, excepting so far as variations
of density are superinduced by a state of motion.
    The fundamental idea relative to force, to which these con
siderations conduct, may be thus expressed :-—All force is action
by pressure of a uniform <U+FB02>uid, the pressure of which is pro
portional to its density.
    I have now to meet some objections which I anticipate will be
raised against these views. It will probably be urged that since
the progress of science has shown that bodies consist of discrete
parts, there can be no continuity of surface, and the forms of
solids are not actually what they appear to be; that absolute
constancy of form is not actual, all known bodies being capable
of yielding to force ; and that as two solids cannot be lnade to
come into actual contact, mutual pressure of their parts is not
actual. After all this has been fully admitted, there remains
the fact that we do acquire, by our senses and the power of abs
traction, distinct perceptions of extension, of continuity of sur
face, of form, of constancy of form, of contact, and of pressure
by contact. If this be denied, the common sense of mankind
would reclaim. It is the very essence of philosophy to rest
upon the foundation of common perceptions, and by reasoning
from these to account for phenomena. If the reasoning be
good, and an explanation of the phenomena be shown to result
from the antecedent fundamental conceptions of matter and
force, we may be said to know their causes in the sense in which
we know anything else. Also, that the fundamental ideas, in
their exact form, are not mere abstractions, but conceptions of

  286     Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
  existences as real as anything else is real, will be demonstrated
  by such explanations, and with more and more evidence as the
  number of the explanations is greater. This mode of philoso
  phizing was fully recognized in Newton’s time,—the necessity
  of appealing to observation and experience, both for the founda
  tions of philosophy and for the data requisite to make and verify
 particular theoretical researches, being clearly understood. It
  is particularly to be remarked that these two uses of experience
  are broadly distinguished in Newton’s writings. The latter is
  met with continually; but the former is placed under the head
 of Rules of Philosophizing, and is perhaps nowhere so distinctly
  stated as in the third Rule.   Newton there says, “hoe est fun
 damentum,” using the singular number to indicate that the
 principle of the method is the foundation of philosophy.
     Another objection may be made to these views on the ground
 that if the pressure of the aether, and the relation of the pressure
 to the density, be among the necessary foundations of theoretical
 research, these facts must themselves remain unaccounted for.
 To this I might reply that if the fundamental ideas of matter
 and force su<U+FB01>ice for the explanation of all phenomena and laws,
 they will account for the pressure, and law of the pressure, of
 air of given temperature, which are facts the same in kind as
 those attributed to the aether. But it is unnecessary to adopt
 this line of reasoning, which brings us to the verge of meta
physics. It is sufficient to maintain that, if all phenomena and
 laws can be shown by reasoning to be consequences of funda
mental facts which are perfectly intelligible from sensation and
 experience, the phenomena and laws are intelligibly accounted for.
     It is important further to remark that the fundamental ideas
above laid down respecting matter and force are by no means
arbitrary. I hold myself in no manner responsible for any of
them. The course of the argumentation by which they were
reached su<U+FB02>iciently shows, I think, that after the adoption of
the Newtonian principle of seeking for universal and fundamental
ideas from sensation and experience, no other than these could
he arrived at. All that I have done is to employ the same
principle in giving to the foundation of philosophy the larger
extent which is required by the existing state of experimental
physics. Not only, as I said above, are all phenomena explained
if the explanations are shown to rest on this foundation, but I
say further that there is absolutely no evidence that intelligible
explanations can rest on any other. Those who choose may
call the fundamental ideas hypotheses. They are, in fact, hypo
theses in the proper sense of the Greek word, 1'. e. foundations.
But being in that respect necessary, they are quite distinct from
those which Newton referred to when he said “ hypotheses non

Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”      287
<U+FB01>ngo,” of which the history of physical science has afforded too
many examples.            _     '
    The foregoing discussion has prepared the way for making
the proper distinction between the theoretical and the experi
mental departments of natural philosophy. The province of
experiment is to discover facts and the relations of facts, i. e.
laws, without respect to causation, or the operation of force.
Kepler's discovery of the laws of the motions of the planets is
an instance. Experiment also furnishes the data necessary for
making theoretical calculation apply to actual instances, and for
_verifying the results of such calculation. The province of
theory is to deduce, by reasoning, from the fundamental ideas of
matter and force, the explanations of facts and laws established
by experiment, and so to refer them to their causes. In the
experimental department, a law is a grouping of observed facts;
in the theoretical, the law is shown to be the consequence of
certain primary facts. Every fact and every law which experi
ment makes known, is a problem for the theorist to solve by
mathematical reasoning.
    It should here be remarked that physical astronomy does not
 immediately come under the above de<U+FB01>nition of theory, because,
while it refers the observed motions of the heavenly bodies to
 the action of forces, it rests on two particular hypotheses, made
pro hdc vice, viz., that all bodies attract in proportion to their
 masses, and that the attraction varies according to the law of
 the inverse square. The truth of these hypotheses is established
 by the coincidence of the results of calculation founded on them
 with facts of observation. That being the case, the hypotheses
 may be regarded as facts, to be placed in the category of facts
 in general, which require to be referred, for their explanation, to
 the fundamental ideas of matter and force. Thus the law of
 gravity, being a quantitative law, should be doducible by
 reasoning.
     The theoretical reasoning above spoken of is, of course,
 mathematical reasoning conducted by symbols. It would not
 be possible, without the aid of such means, to embrace with the
 deductive faculty the consequences of the -fundamental hypo
 theses. In physical astronomy the symbolic reasoning consists
 in the formation and solution of differential equations of the
 <U+FB01>rist order in regard to the number of variables. A general
 physical theory in which force is regarded as the action of a
 <U+FB02>uid medium by pressure, evidently demands the determina
 tion by mathematics of the laws of the motion and pressure of
 the <U+FB02>uid, to effect which the application of a higher and more
 comprehensive order of differential equations is required. Per
 ceiving tho absolute necessity of this research for making pro

  288    Prof. Challis on Newton's “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
  gress in theoretical physics, I have given special attention to
  the application of partial differential equations in hydro
   dynamics, and, after a long-sustained intellectual effort, suc
  ceeded at length in demonstrating certain propositions which
  hold the same place relatively to general theoretical physics
   that the dynamical problems which Newton <U+FB01>rst solved held
   with respect to physical astronomy. Much more, I am fully
   aware, is required to be effected in the same direction. But I
  claim to have done for general physics what Newton did for
  physical astronomy; that is, to have entered upon the appro
  priate course, and to have overcome the initial di<U+FB01>iculties.
  Those who would dispute this claim, must either call in question
  the truth of the hydrodynamical theorems,. or contest their
  general applicability to theoretical physics. I am prepared to
  maintain both these positions.
     A few more general remarks respecting the relation of theory
  to experiment remain to be made. It is admitted that scienti<U+FB01>c
  knowledge does not consist merely in acquaintance with the
  facts and laws which experiment reveals; to be complete, it
  must embrace the results of experiment by a theorg/—that is, as
  the term implies, by a perception of their causes resting on an
  intelligible basis. For proof that theory is recognized to be the
  end of experiment, I may appeal to the attempts which are
  constantly being made by experimentalists to theorize—that is,
  to assign causes. “Felix qui potuit rerum ‘cognoscere causas.”
  But, because experiment is thus subordinate to the establishment
  of theory, those experiments are the best which are best adapted
 to this purpose,-on which account correct theoretical notions
-are of much importance to the experimentalist, as serving to
  control and guide the course of his experiments. In this
 respect I venture to a<U+FB02>irm, from acquaintance with the theore
 tical applications of experiments, that experimental research
 might be greatly aided by the recognition of the fundamental
 ideas respecting matter and force which I have so much insisted
 upon in this communication, and by the acceptance of the
 mathematical results which I have obtained relative to the laws
 of the motion and pressure of the aetherial medium.
     The theoretical principles which it is the object of the fore
 going discussion to explain and to establish, are precisely those
 on which are founded the theories of light, heat, gravity, elec
 tricity, galvanism, and magnetism which I have proposed in
 various communications to this Journal. I might appeal to the
 large number of successful explanations of phenomena which
 those theories exhibit, for evidence of the truth of the principles
 and the correctness of the deductive reasoning ap lied to them.
 But I feel it to be vain to expect that the appeal wi be attended

to, or the explanations receive any consideration, so long as the
minds of physicists are preoccupied with modes of philosophizing
totally at variance with that which I have adopted. For this
reason I propose to conclude this communication with a brief
exposition of the principles of the antagonistic methods.
   The prevailing physical theories may be classed under two
heads, su<U+FB01>iciently distinguished in their general characteristics.
In the one class, the atomic constitution of all substances is ad
mitted; the existence of the aether is recognized; certain move
ments of the atoms, both of the aether and of the grosser bodies,
relatively to each other, and about axes they are supposed to
have, are assumed; dynamical effects are attributed to these
motions; an unde<U+FB01>ned use is made of the word “polarity,”
and the application of differential equations is in a great mea
sure dispensed with. An example of this method of philoso
phizing is exhibited by the work on ‘Matter and Ether,’ cri
ticized in the Number of this Magazine for last April, which
shows most remarkably how- easy it is to invent causes of
phenomena, if' all reference to an independent foundation of
philosophy, such as that insisted upon by Newton in Regula
Ill., be omitted, and the necessity of deduction by mathematical
reasoning be consequently avoided. Theorizers of this class
have recourse to personal conceptions, which they form ad
libitum, and which, undoubtedly, are to be ranked among the
“somnia” that Newton refers to. Also these hypotheses are
generally such as require explanation quite as much as the
phenomena they are supposed to explain, and therefore do not
advance scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge a single step.
   The hypothesis of the isotropic constitution of the anther,’
invented to account for phenomena of light, is very closely
allied to the class of hypotheses just spoken of. If it should be
more successful than it has as yet been in explaining pheno
mena, it would still require to be itself explained.       Having
already so often expressed my views on the undulatory theory
of light, I will only remark here that the necessity for the
isotropic hypothesis has arisen from the adoption of a theory
which does not recognize the fundamental ideas of matter and
force, and consequently does not regard the aether as a con
 tinuous <U+FB02>uid.
    The other class of physical theories, which is now much in
vogue, is characterized by the deduction of generalizations from
special facts and laws. The most complete exhibition of this
method that I am acquainted with is contained in the article “ On
Energy” in ‘ Good Words’ (Oct. 1862), to which I have before
referred in a communication “ On the Source and Maintenance of
the Sun’s Heat” (Phil. Mag. for June 1863). Professors Thom
    Phil. May. S. 4. Vol. 26. No. 175. Oct. 1863.          U

 290    Prof. Challis on Newtori’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”
 son and Tait consider that “the simple experiment of melting
 two pieces of ice by rubbing them together” justi<U+FB01>es the general
 conclusion that “sensibleheat is motion.” And again, the law '
 of the dynamical equivalence of heat, established by experiment,
 is made the foundation of a dynamical theory of heat, and of one
 more comprehensive, termed the “ Conservation of Energy.”
 This mode of philosophizing avowedly belongs to the age of
 Bacon. It certainly is not the philosophy of the Newtonian
 epoch. A philosopher of Newton’s school would regard the
 above-mentioned experiment, or the still more signi<U+FB01>cant one of
 making a bar of iron red-hot by repeated blow s, as simply a fact
 which he is required to explain by a course of reasoning founded
 on ultimate principles. So the law of the dynamical equivalence
 of heat would only be looked upon as a law which must admit
 of explanation by the proper course of reasoning starting from
 the same fundamental principles. If these explanations be
 given, all the demands of science are satis<U+FB01>ed. It would be
 contrary to the principle of this method to theorize on any other
 foundation than that of ultimate ideas respecting matter and
force, and their necessary concomitant the aether.
    But let us look a little more closely into the above generaliza
tions.    Heat is a<U+FB01>irmed to be motion.     But heat, whatever else
it be, is force, for it does what only force can do. The very law
of the dynamical equivalence of heat, of which Professor Thomson
has made so much use, proves that heat is force ; for what but
force can have a dynamical equivalent? Now force is not mo
tion, but something extraneous which causes a change of motion.
How then can heat be de<U+FB01>ned or described as motion? I ob
serve that Professor Tyndall calls heat “a mode of motion ;”
but as this designation only implies that there are other modes
of motion besides heat, and does not admit the idea of force, it
is open to all the foregoing objections. Another objection may
be raised on the ground that to assert heat to be motion is to
contradict common understanding. Let us suppose an unscien
ti<U+FB01>c person, after witnessing the experiment of striking a bar of
iron till it was red-hot, to ask a philosopher what was the cause
of the heat, and to get the answer, “heat is motion ;” he might
reasonably reply, “ I know what heat is, and what motion is,
and I know that heat is not motion.” The logic of this answer,
which amounts to sayingthat the language of the philosopher is
inconsistent with common experience, is irresistible, because
scienti<U+FB01>c language is not exempt from the necessity of ful<U+FB01>lling
the condition of informing common understandings.
    For the sake of contrasting this mode of philosophy with that
which I am advocating, I will now give the answer to the above
question which is supplied by the principles of the latter. The

   Prof. Challis on Newton’s “Foundation of all Philosophy.”      291
   hammer on striking the bar of iron is suddenly arrested in its
   course, and the force which stops it is the upward resistance of
   the super<U+FB01>cial parts of the bar. But as this resistance does 8
   great deal of work in a very short time, the constituent atoms
  must run into closer proximity to supply the requisite force, the
  resistance of pressure being universally greater the greater the
  density of the atoms. On the cessation of the shock the atoms
  tend to return, through a succession of vibrations, to their nor-. ,
  mal positions; but the repetition of the blows maintains and
  intensi<U+FB01>es the vibrations. The vibratory motions of the atoms
  in the aether causes vibrations of the aether, the dynamical action
  of which is heat. (This assertion rests on my mathematical
  theory of heat.) Heat-vibrations are always accompanied by
  light-vibrations. (This also is a mathematical deduction.) The
  light-vibrations become sensible to the eye when of sufficient
  intensity. The same explanation applies, so far as regards the
  production of heat, to the experiment of rubbing two pieces of
  ice together.   In both experiments mechanical force is employed
  to produce the heat; both are simple instances of the law of the
  dynamical equivalence of heat.       Necessarily, therefore, regard
  being had to that law, heat is amoole offorce. I cannot imagine
  a reason why in drawing an inference respecting the quality of
 heat from these facts, the word “force” should be avoided. The
 foregoing explanation of these instances may be considered to be
 some approximation towards an it priori theory of the law of
 dynamical equivalence.
     Again, the generalization which Professor Thomson has based
 on the law of the dynamical equivalence of heat, is open to
 weighty objections both in respect to the philosophic principles
 it involves, and the conclusions drawn from it. I have already
 urged that a theory cannot be based upon a particular experi
 mental law, the province of theory being to account for a law
 by mathematical deduction from universal and fundamental hy
potheses. On this ground I object to calling the above-men
tioned generalization “ The Dynamical Theory of Heat,” nothing
having hitherto been published in science to which those terms
properly apply except the theory of heat which I have proposed
in the Philosophical Magazine for March 1859. This diversity
of view as to the foundation of a dynamical theory of heat leads
to widely di<U+FB01>'ei'ent results. For instance, Professors Thomson
and Tait deduce from “ the contemplation of dynamical energy
and its laws of transformation in dead matter,” that “ all energy
tends ultimately to become heat, which cannot be transformed
into any other modi<U+FB01>cation ; ” and consequently that “ we ‘must
conclude that when all the chemical and gravitation energies of
the universe have taken their <U+FB01>nal kinetic form, the result will

  that is now de<U+FB01>nite and separate—chaos and darkness as in the
  beginning.”                               _
      On the contrary, my researches, Wl11Cl1 proceed on the hypo
  thesis that all the forces of the universe are different modes of
  the dynamical action of the vibrations and currents of the aather,
. do indeed lead to the result that various forms of force are con
  vertible into that of heat, and the associated form of light; but
   at the same time they indicate how the repulsion of heat may,
  by the modi<U+FB01>cation which the dynamic action of undulations
  undergoes when they are compounded together, be changed to
   attraction. This transformation I have discussed particularly
   in arts. 2 and 3 of my “ Theory of Molecular Forces” contained
   in the Philosophical Magazine for February 1860, and in the
   Essay on the Sun’s Heat already mentioned. I have there ad
   verted to the important consequence of that theory, that the num
   berless vibrations which radiate from the individual atoms of a
   body, producing by their dynamical action the body's internal
   heat, by their subsequent composition form undulations to the
   action of which the attraction of gravitation may be attributed.
   Moreover, instead of concluding that “the sun must at present
   he in the condition of a heated body cooling,” I am led by my re
   searches to the inference that both the sun and the other bodies
   of the solar systemare, in regard to internal heat, in a state of
   permanence, the <U+FB02>uctuations, if any, taking place about a mean
   value which is constant so long as the dynamic action of the
   universe is constant. Thus in two most important particulars,
   one relating to the convertibility of heat into other forms of
   force, and the other to the stability of the intrinsic heat of
    masses, my results are directly opposed to those of Professor
   Thomson. The analogy of nature, as inferred from the move
    ments of the planets, is certainly in favour of the stability of the
   heat of the bodies of the solar system. I think, therefore, I
   may justly conclude, having also indicated a possible source of
   error in Professor Thomson’s mode of philosophy, that there is
   not the “sober scienti<U+FB01>c certainty” which he supposes in the
   inferences he has drawn respecting the duration of the present
   order of the universe.    The power that made can unmake ,- but
   as to when and how, physical science can reveal nothing. I have
   felt the less scruple in discussing thus freely Professor Thom
   s0n’s views, because, although they admit of question, he has
   published them in a popular periodical, and because he has
   since expressed (Phil. Mag. for June) his readiness to support
   the correctness of the opinions contained in the article “ On
   Energy” when he sees proper occasion for so doing.

       PROPOSE brie<U+FB02>y to lay before the mathematical readers of
        the Magazine a wide generalization, and at the same time
 a more precise statement, of the theorem contained at the close
 of my paper in the last Number. The theorem, as therein enun
 ciated, was drawn from geometrical considerations, it having <U+FB01>rst
 manifested itself dimly to the author by a sort of indirect re<U+FB02>ec
 tion from a metrical theory of perspective. I have since obtained
a very easy proof of it in its extended form, which in spirit amounts
to a free algebraical paraphrase of the method indicated in the <U+FB01>nal
foot-note of the paper in question. The ultimate form of the
perfected theorem is particularly interesting from its simplicity of
 application, and from its connexion with the grand and growing
 theory of invariants. The proof of it will appear in its proper
place in the continuation of the paper in which, in its incipient
state, it <U+FB01>rst came to light1'.                           '
     Theorem.-—Let a <U+FB01>gure, whether plane, solid, or hyperspatial,
 be supposed to be limited by a locus or loci de<U+FB01>ned by one or
 more algebraical equations, not necessarily the most general of
 their respective degrees, but each at least the most general of its
 degree and kind I, and let the density at any point of the <U+FB01>gure
 be any homogeneous function of the coordinates, and let the
mass of such <U+FB01>gure be supposed to be known in terms of the
 constants which enter into the de<U+FB01>ning equations; next let the
 density at each point of the mass be multiplied by a new factor,
-which may be any rational integral homogeneous function of the
 coordinates. Then the theorem affirms that the expression for
 the new mass may be obtained by operating upon the expression
 for the original one with differential operators precisely identical
 with combinations of certain of those which serve to de<U+FB01>ne an
 invariant of the given system of equations, and which will be
found set forth in my paper “ On the Calculus of Forms,” in the

treated apart from the case of a general cubic curve.

example, by means of the known expressions for the area or
content of a triangle, ellipse, pyramid, ellipsoid, or cone, this
theorem enables us by differentiation and algebraieal processes
alone to obtain the parameters which de<U+FB01>ne the centres of gra
vity, moments of inertia, principal axes, &c. of such <U+FB01>gures.
    I must add an important observation, viz. that the theorem
remains true when one of the de<U+FB01>ning equations (supposing
there to be more than one), instead of being the most general of
a certain degree and kind, is affected with arbitrary numerical
coe<U+FB01>icients (zeros or others), provided only that it be homogeneous
in the variables. Again, the theorem continues to hold when
the original density, instead of being a homogeneous function of
the variables, is such function multiplied by any Covariant of the
de<U+FB01>ning equations taken separately or in groups—using the word
covariant in its most extended sense, so as to comprehend frac
tional and irrational as well as integral forms,—the only effect
of the introduction of such new factor into the density being to
modify the formof the differential operators. There are certain
very special cases, to which it is not necessary to allude here in
detail, in which the theorem becomes illusory: such will be the
case, ea‘. gr., for a plane area when the given density is a homo
geneous function in the variables of the negative degree 3, and
for a solid content when that density is of the negative degree 4*.

XLI. On a Question arising from a recent Mathematical Contro

       AVING for some time turned my thoughts away from
    -     mathematical subjects, I did not discover till lately that
 the present Number (that for September) of the Philosophical
 Magazine contains a passage involving an objection the relevancy
 of which I ought not for a moment to let pass unquestioned.
 number of functions and any number of variables.          Dr. Armhold, in the
last Number of Crelle’s Journal, states erroneously that these equations
 were given by me for binary functions only, and subsequently generalized
by Cayley and Clebsch.
   * A similar method applied to ea-tents (as curves, surfaces, &c.) gives
rise to curious theorems. Thus I <U+FB01>nd that the mass of a plane curve
 a<U+FB01>ected with a density varying at each point as the square of the cosine of
 the inclination of the curve to a<U+FB01>xed line, is a differential derivative of the
 length of the curve.   So, again, the moment of inertia of a curve in respect
to any axis perpendicular to its   lane, is a differential derivative of its mo
 ment in respect to an arbitrary me in its plane.

            XLII. On the Focal Aryustment of the Eye.
                   By BARNARD S. Pnooron, Esq.j[
                               [With a Plate].
THERE is considerable difficulty in accumulating statistical
         evidence regarding the powers of the eye; and, as far as I
am aware, there has not been anything published upon precisely
the same subject as that which forms the material of this com
munication. These considerations, I hope, will justify me in
bringing forward the subject in its present crude condition.
   In March 1860 Mr. Wharton Jones read a paper before the
Royal S0ciety§ giving an analysis of his own sight; the present
paper was designed to show how far his observations coincide
with general experience, and to afford answers to the following
questions :-—             ‘
    Is it occasionally, generally, or universally that the human
eye has distinct foci for vertical and horizontal lines?
   * For an explanation of the symbols (e,), v, u see my paper in the Phil.
Mag. for December 1862.

   I Communicated by the Author, having been read before the British
Association at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, August 1863.
   § See Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xx. p. 480.

‘Z96     Mr. B. S. Proctor on the Focal Adjustment of the Eye.‘
     Is the power of altering the focus of the eye exceptional or
 general? and what is the extent of the change?
     Can eyes, having distinct vertical and horizontal foci, be made
 to adjust these foci to any particular distance at the same time?
     Have the two eyes generally different focal lengths?
     Does a good resolving power always accompany a good adjust
 ing power?                                         '
     Are markings on a <U+FB01>at surface resolved better by one eye or
 both ?
     What is the appearance of a vertical line, and what of a hori
 zontal line and a point, when within or beyond focus? '
     Do the powers of the eye vary much with time of day, bodily
  or mental fatigue, &c. '3
     After a few preliminary experiments, the following apparatus
 and observations were adopted as the most suitable means of
 eliciting the information sought.
     Upon a pair of parallel wooden rods, A, Pl. VI., a stage is made
 to slide; the stage consists of two <U+FB02>at pieces of wood, B, C, at right
 angles to each other—the vertical one, C, carrying a test-object,
 and the horizontal one a taper, D. The light being on the stage
 with the test object, gives it a constant illumination, as they both
 move together. The eye being placed at one end of the rods,
 the object is between it and the light. The object consists of a
 slip of glass coated with a thin <U+FB01>lm of silver or other material,
 upon which <U+FB01>ne lines may be scratched so as to transmit light;
 upon this surface is drawn a cross consisting of <U+FB01>ne double lines
 such as shown at E, the width between the double lines being
 varied according to the observer and the nature of the experi
 ment in hand. The focus is considered to be accurate when the
 <U+FB01>ne double lines are perceived to be double ; and the adjustment
 is considered imperfect when the cross appears to consist of misty
 lines or a multiplicity of lines.
     The test object for ascertaining the resolving power of the
 eye consists of two lines diverging at a very acute angle, such as
 shown at F, and supplied with an index showing how many
 thousandths of an inch space there is between the lines at any
 part of their length. This object being made to slide behind the
 perforation in the upright portion of the stage, commencing at
 the end where the space is greatest, it is pushed towards the
narrow end till the lines just cease to be distinguishable as two;
the number of thousandths is then read off as an indication of
"the resolving power of the eye.
    This test-object, and the same mode of using it, was adopted
 in experimenting upon the power of various eyes to change
focus; the resolving power having been ascertained for the
 shortest comfortable focus, the same was tried for double and

    _Mr. B.        Proctor‘on the Focal _A¢_ljustment of the Eye.                    297
three times the distance. In all these experiments, the person
whose sight was being examined did not know the measurements
till the conclusion of the experiments; thus was avoided any ten
dency which there might have been to fancy that at double the
distance double the width of the lines was requisite to admit of
resolution.
    The adjustment of the eye is only partly under command of
the will, but the power over it increases with practice, various
observers being able to obtain a focus with'facility at the end of
a few experiments which was not readily obtained at the com
mencement ; they also gain a facility in deciding when the test
object is in perfect focus, or the best attainable focus.
    While some have hesitated long before deciding, others have
come to a definite and <U+FB01>xed conclusion at once, and on repeat
ing the experiments, have given the same results, although they
had not the means of knowing that the distance or size which they
required the second time was the same as they selected the <U+FB01>rst.

    Note—The lines marked D give the distance in inches at which observations
were made, any convenient short focus being taken for comparison with the results
obtained at twice and three times the distance.
    The lines marked W indicate the resolving power in thousandths of an inch
according to the principle made use of in the last Table.
     In examining the results indicated in these Tables, there must
necessarily be some allowance made for the impracticability of
deciding exactly when the object is in its best focus. Few observers
could indicate their focal distance with decision to within a quarter
of an inch; consequently when there is only a fraction of an
inch between the foci of the eyes, or between the foci for the
vertical and horizontal lines, that may be disregarded, unless the
same fraction recurs in parallel experiments.
     Of nine observers, seven have the same focus for both eyes.
In one case the focus for the right eye is longest, and in one that
for the left is longest.
     Four have a longer focus for vertical lines. Two have a
shorter focus for vertical lines. Three have equal foci for both.
     Of seven observers, six have the power of varying the focus
for both horizontal and vertical lines, and one for the horizontal
line only. All have the power of bringing both lines into focus
at once at distances beyond the shortest focus, particulars of
which are as follows :—
     B. S. P. sees both horizontal and vertical lines clearly at the
‘same time at 9 inches distance with the left eye or both eyes,
and at greater distances with the right eye.
     T. P. B. with the right eye sees both lines clearly at 30 inches ;

with the left, temporarily clear at 19; with both eyes at once,
 15 inches is his best focus, and that is evidently impe1'fect.
    F. S. with either eye sees both lines clearly at distances between
 4 inches and a foot; with both eyes, at distances from 8% inches
 to a foot. The vertical line seen with both eyes appears split at
 distances less than 8% inches.
    M. J. P. with the right eye, by an effort sees both clearly at
8 inches; with the left at 10, and with both at 8 to 11% inches.
    F. R. with either or both eyes sees both lines clearly at 6 inches
 and greater distances.
    W. W. P. with either or both eyes sees both lines clearly at 5
 inches and greater distances.
     M. S. with either or both eyes sees both lines clearly at 10 to
 12 inches and greater distances.»
     Of nine observers, four have the best resolving power for
 horizontal lines, one for vertical, and four equally good for
 either. The better resolving power generally coincides with '
 the shorter focus; but in one instance (C. B.) the horizontal line
 had the longer focus and the better resolving power.
     Theoretically, at double the distance from the eye the lines
 should have double the space between them to be resolvable; in
 most cases less than double the space is required‘ at double the
 -distance; in some cases the proportion is preserved; and in two
  (T. P. B. and M. J. P.) I found it reversed for the horizontal
 lines, though in all cases in which the measurements were
 taken the observer considered the focus to be accurately ob
 tained at both distances.
     It is probable that there may frequently be a considerable
imperfection in the best focus which can be obtained by a given
 eye at any distance, and that most observers will believe the
 object to be in perfect focus when it is in the best focus which
 they can obtain. It may thus happen that both vertical and
 horizontal lines may be reported in focus if they are both at
 once in as good focus as either can be placed in when taken
 separately. It probably also will occur with some eyes that they
 have a large range of focal adjustment, but that the degree of
 aberrations will vary; thus there may be one adjustment more
free from aberrations than others. An eye capable of adjust
 ment with very little aberration for rays diverging at one foot
 distance, may be capable of adjustment for parallel rays, but
‘then have a greater aberration; thus when a star is looked at,
 it may not be in perfect focus on account of the aberrations,
 though any nearer object would, while that adjustment is re
tained, be in worse focus. It is likewise probable that a line
would be reported in perfect focus if it were not very evidently
out of focus, and it were found that increasing or decreasing the

   -Mr. B. S. Proctor on the Hocal Adjustment of the Eye.       30].
focal length of the eye only rendered it less clear; this we may
take to be the explanation of the discrepancies in the Table of
Adjusting Powers. Though the eye is really focused to the
various distances at which observations are made, the focus is
more free from aberrations when the resolving power is greater
in proportion to the distance than it should theoretically be.
   ‘When an observation is made with both eyes, we generally
<U+FB01>nd the results coincide with those of the best eye, the clear
impression apparently eclipsing the misty one.
   Different observers describe the appearance of a line out of
focus in various manners as follows: a faint band but with clear
edges-—-a line with misty edges—a band consisting of two or
more misty lines, sometimes nearly clear and not constant in
number ; the motions of the eyelid ‘will frequently alter the
number.
   M. J. P. says a line within focus looks like multiple lines, and
beyond focus, like a line with softened edges.
   F. R. believes he can focus to any distance, but at long dis
tances a line looks rough at the edges.
   W. W. P. finds that when beyond focus, the horizontal line
splits, and the vertical becomes misty.
   I <U+FB01>nd a dark line at about a foot distance, while the eye is
adjusted for parallel rays, looks like two indistinct spectra, the
order of the colours being blue, yellow, and blue, with a dark
hand between each of the blues and the yellow. When slightly
within focus (say 9 inche distant with a focus for 1 foot), nar
rower spectra of brighter colours are seen. The same is observed
less distinctly of a horizontal line. With a great discrepancy of
focus the horizontal line splits into several lines, which change
their shade and position with the involuntary winking of the eye- '
lid. A spot at the distance of two or three yards, seen by both
eyes while a distant object is looked at, appears as four spots
thus    --   --I ; but if seen at the same distance while a near
objectis looked at (say 12 or 18 inches), it appears as four spots
thus 3     ;—the greater distance between the spots being the
result of the degree of convergence of the optic axes, the shorter
distance being the result of a focal aberration. Of course the
spots seen in this way were not clear; and when luminous points
were used instead of dark spots, the forms they took, being more
easily examined, were perceived to be characteristic. A star
seen with a short focus appears like a luminous ring with radia
tions, the principal part of which spread in the vertical direction.
   Looking at a light through a pin-hole in a card held at a foot
or two distance while the focus was for parallel rays, the appear
ance was that of a group of misty luminous spots spreading
principally in the horizontal direction.                   '       -

302      Mr. B. S. Proctor on the Focal Aa_’justment of the Eye.
    Fatigue diminishes the power of the eyes to obtain the extremes
 of long or short focus, and decreases their resolving power at
 all distances. Some observers <U+FB01>nd that a focus which cannot
be immediately obtained will come after a little perseverance;
others <U+FB01>nd that a sudden effort is most successful ; in both cases,
when the focus has been obtained only by an effort, it cannot
be long retained. Thus on the Table, the shortest focus for
vertical lines which could be obtained by T. P. B. is given as 11
or 12 inches; but that was obtained only by an e<U+FB02>brt, and the
shortest focus, for the same lines, which could be retained suit
ably for examining the resolving power, was found to be about
2 feet.
    When the length of the ocular focus varies, the relation between
the horizontal and vertical foci do not change, that which is long
est at one time being always longest. Some observers say they
cannot do <U+FB01>ne work before breakfast; others say they can read
before breakfast, with the naked eye, type which requires specta
cles at any other time of the day; some others, myself included,
have failed to <U+FB01>nd any difference, with carefully tried experi
ments.
    I have used the words “ resolving power ” to express a power
which varies with several physical circumstances, but it is not
very easy to decide which are the usual or principal causes of its
variation. It is not unlikely that, as regards the formation of
an image, chromatic and spherical aberrations, and aberrations
depending upon the curves of the eye being distorted by mus
cular and other causes, are at least the principal causes of its
variation. And as regards the perception of the image, the sen
sitiveness of the optic nerve, variation in the degree of its rami
<U+FB01>cations, and education are the most important.
    The resolving power is necessarily greatest when the light is
moderate; with the apparatus before described, the naked <U+FB02>ame
behind the test-object when near the eye was generally found too
bright; greater resolving power was obtained by interposing a
piece of oiled paper, and in some cases the interposition of
writing-paper without oil was still better; at a distance of two
or three feet the stronger illumination was generally preferred.
In like manner, when the test-object was placed at the end of a
telescope-tube (an arrangement I used for making observations
by daylight), I found that for my own eye, sunlight re<U+FB02>ected from
white paper was too powerful an illumination, and even sunlight
re<U+FB02>ected from a carpet of dull colours was less advantageous than
diffused daylight re<U+FB02>ected from the same. But it is probable
that the degree of illumination most advantageous will vary
greatly with even the same eye according to the nature of the
object, -grey lines requiring a stronger light when upon either

 black on white.
     The faculty of perceiving what we see is one which depends so
 much upon practice, that any observer, however critical he may
 be in other observations, is not unlikely to fail in his <U+FB01>rst attempts
 to ascertain what are the peculiarities of his own vision in respect
 to some of the particulars indicated in the above experiments.
 The habit of careful scrutiny of objects in focus does not facili
 tate our perception of the impressions produced by focal and
 chromatic aberrations in objects under abnormal circumstances.
 In all experiments upon vision, it is necessary for us to remember
 that the impression produced upon the retina differs from the
 impression produced upon the mind in many important particu
 lars, though in how many it is di<U+FB01>icult to say.

 XLIII. Abstract of an Investigation on Plane Water-lines. By
  W. J. Mncquomv RANKINE, C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS.L. 8; E.§"c.*
                              [With a Plate.] '
 1. THIS paper contains an abstract of a mathematical inves
            tigation which has been communicated in detail to the
 Royal Society. By the term “plane water-line” is meant one
 of those curves which a particle of a liquid describes in <U+FB02>owing
 past a solid body, when such <U+FB02>ow takes place in plane layers.
Such curves are suitable for the water-lines of a ship ; for during
 the motion of a well-formed ship, the vertical displacements of
the particles of water are small compared with the dimensions
 of the ship ; so that the assumption that the <U+FB02>ow takes place in
plane layers, though not absolutely true, is su<U+FB02>iciently near the
truth for practical purposes-f.                                     .
    2. The author refers to the researches of Professor Stokes
 (Camb. Trans. 1842) “On the Steady Motion of an Incom
 pressible Fluid,” and of Professor William Thomson (made in»
 1858, but not yet published), as containing the demonstration
of the general principles of the <U+FB02>ow of a liquid past a solid bodyi.
    3. Every <U+FB01>gure of a- solid, past which a liquid is capable of
<U+FB02>owing smoothly, generates an endless series of water-lines,
   ' Communicated by the Author, having been read to the British Asso
ciation at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in August 1863.
   1' As water-line curves have at present no single word to designate them
in mathematical language, it is proposed to call them Neotds, from vr<U+FB01>zs,
the Ionic genitive of rank.           _
   I See also a paper by Dr. Hoppe, in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Mathe
tics’ for March 1856.

    which become sharper in their forms as they are more distant
    from the primitive water-line of the solid. The only exact
     water-lines whose forms have hitherto been completely investi
    gated, are those generated by the cylinder in two dimensions,
    and by the sphere in three dimensions. In addition to what is
    already known of those lines, the author points out that when a
    cylinder moves through still water, the orbit of each particle of
    water is one loop of an elastic curve.
         4. The pro<U+FB01>les of waves have been used with success in prac
    tice as water-lines for ships, <U+FB01>rst by Mr. Scott Russell (for the
     explanation of whose system the author refers to the ‘ Transac
    tions of the Institution of Naval Architects’ for 1860-62), and
     afterwards by others. As to the frictional resistance of vessels
    having such lines, the author refers to his own papers—one read
     to the British Association in 1861 and printed in various engi
     neering journals, and another read to the Royal Society in 1862
    and printed in the Philosophical Transactions.
         5. The author proceeds to investigate and explain the proper
     ties of a. class of water-lines pomprising an endless variety of
     forms and proportions. In each series of such lines the primi
     tive water-line is a particular sort of oval characterized by this
     property—that the ordinate at any point of the oval is propor
     tional to the angle between two lines drawn from that point to
     ‘two foci. (In Plate VI., LB represents a quadrant of such an
     oval, 0 being its centre, and A one of the foci ; the other focus
    is at an equal distance to the other side of the centre.) Ovals
     of this class differ from ellipses in being considerably fuller at
    the ends and <U+FB02>atter at the sides.
        6. The length of the oval may bear any proportion to its
    breadth, from equality (when the oval becomes a circle) to in<U+FB01>
     nity. (In the Plate the length 0 L is to the breadth O B nearly
     as 17' : 6.)
         7. Each oval generates an endless series of water-lines, which
    -become sharper in <U+FB01>gure as they are further from the oval*. In
 veach of those derived lines, the excess of the ordinate at a given
     point above a certain minimum value is proportional to the angle
     between a pair of lines drawn from that point to the two foci.
         8. There is thus an endless series of ovals, each generating an
    .endless series of water-lines ; and amongst those <U+FB01>gures a con
     tinuous or “fair” curve can always be found, combining any
     proportion of length to breadth from equality to in<U+FB01>nity, with
    any degree of fullness or <U+FB01>neness 0f_entrance, from absolute bluff
    fness to a knife~edge.
  .     "‘__As a convenient and signi<U+FB01>cant name for these water-lines, the term
     “ Oogenous_Neo1ds ” is proposed (from ’Q0'yeV1)s', generatedfrom an egg, or
‘ oval).

    9. The lines thus obtained present striking likenesses to those
at which naval architects have arrived through practical expe
 rience; and every successful model in existing vessels can be
 closely imitated by means of them, from a Dutch galliot to a
 racing-boat.
    10. Any series of water-lines, including the primitive oval,
 are easily and quickly constructed with the ruler and compasses
 as follows. Parallel to the longitudinal axis 0 X, draw a series
 of straight lines at equal distances apart. Through the foci
draw a series of circular arcs A Cl, A C9, Szc. so as to contain a
series of angles found by dividing those distances by
                             0 L*-0A°_
                             W
    Each of those circular arcs indicates the direction of motion in
still water of each of the particles that it traverses. Then through
the angles of the network formed by the straight lines and cir
cular arcs draw a series of curves; these will be the required
water-lines*.                          _
    The centre of curvature of the oval at L is the focus A.
    11. The following curves, traversing certain important points
in the water-lines, are exactly similar for all water-lines of this
class, and are easily and quickly constructed with the compasses.

    L Q, N and L P are the two branches of a curve of the fourth
order, having a pair of asymptotes which traverse O, making
angles of 30° with O X. A straight line joining L andP makes
an angle of 30° with L O. The two branches cross the axis 0 X
at L, making angles of 45°. The branch LQN traverses a
series of points, at each of which the velocity of gliding of the
particles of water along the water-line is less than at any other
point on the same water-line. The branch L P traverses a series
of points, at each of which the velocity of gliding is greater than
at any other point on the same water-line.

minimum velocity of gliding: from P onwards it traverses a

and one of maximum velocity of gliding. Hence the latter class
of lines cause less commotion in the water than the former.
    14. On the water-line P Q which traverses the point 1’ itself,
the velocity of gliding changes more gradually than on any
other water-line having the same proportion of length to breadth.
Water-lines possessing this character can be constructed with
any proportion of length to breadth, from ~/3 (which gives an
oval through L and P) to in<U+FB01>nity. The <U+FB01>ner of those lines are
found to be nearly approximated to by wave-lines ; but are less
hollow at the bow than wave-lines are.
   15. The author shows how horizontal water-lines at the bow,
drawn according to this system, may be combined with vertical
plane lines of motion for the water at the stern, if desired by the
naval architect.
   16. In this, as in every system of water-lines, a certain rela
tion (according to a principle <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Mr. Scott
Russell) must be preserved between the form and dimensions of
the bow and the maximum speed of the ship, in order that the
appreciable resistance may be wholly frictional and proportional
to the square of the velocity (as the experimental researches of
Mr. J. R. Napier and the author have shown it to be in well
formed ships), and may not be augmented by terms increasing
as the fourth and higher powers of the velocity through the
action of vertical disturbances of the water.

THE completion of the <U+FB01>rst volume of this work enables us to
       form a more de<U+FB01>nite estimate of its general scope and plan,
as well as of the degree of success with which that plan is being
carried out, than could be formed from the <U+FB01>rst two Parts, a notice
of which was given in this Magazine four months ago (Phil. Mag.
for June 1863, p. 473). We then expressed the fear that the limits
assigned to the work would prove too narrow to allow of the latter
portions being treated with the same fulness of detail as the begin
ning ; we are therefore glad to <U+FB01>nd that it has been decided to
increase its size by nearly one-third, the intention now being to com
plete the work in twenty-one, instead of sixteen, monthly parts.
making four volumes, which will together contain about 4000 pages.
Careful economy of the space thus gained will still be needed in
order to avoid the necessity of unduly curtailing the concluding por
tions of the work.

      Great credit is due to editor and publishers for the regularity and
   punctuality which have hitherto attended the issue of the monthly
   Parts; but it is to be feared that it will not be found possible to
   complete the publication of the work at the same rapid rate. There
   has appeared each month, since the publication began, a Part con
   taining l2 sheets of 16 pages, or altogether 192 pages, each con
   taining, on the average, rather more matter than two pages of the
  Edinburgh or Quarterly Review. The mere revision of this quantity
  of scienti<U+FB01>c matter is more than it seems to us possible for any one
   to accomplish properly in the course of a month; for the labour of
  ef<U+FB01>ciently correcting the proof-sheets of a book like the present
  nequiring, as it does, that the attention be directed simultaneously
  to the matter, to the language, to the punctuation, and to the detec
  tion of errors of a technical kind, which in works on science are more
  than commonly plentiful—is such as cannot be supported for more
  than a few hours consecutively. Hence, unless the printing of the
  Dictionary is at present very considerably in advance of the publica
  tion, a time will come, before the issue of the work is completed,
  when, at the present rate, the whole of the printed matter will have
  been given to the public. Should this occur, it would be most fatal
  to the scienti<U+FB01>c character of the work to attempt to go on with the
  issue of it as rapidly as at present; for it appears to us clearly
  impossible that it could then receive the amount of revision neces
  sary to ensure that degree of accuracy which, in awork of this kind,
  is a matter of the very <U+FB01>rst importance. Unless, therefore, the
  arrangements already made are such as to allow ample time for the
  revision of the remaining portions, we would urge in the strongest
  manner, either that the amount of matter issued each month should
 be reduced, say to six sheets, or that the publication should take
 place at longer intervals.
    We feel that the volume before us su<U+FB01>iciently justi<U+FB01>es these remarks.
 The known character of Mr. Watts, both as a writer and as a man
 of science, is a guarantee that the fullest experience and most
 thorough knowledge have ‘been brought to bear on its production:
 yet the last Part of the volume contains a list of errata extending to
 nearly three pages. This alone is sut<U+FB01>cient proof of the di<U+FB01>iculty of
 the undertaking; for the careful revision after publication which is
 evidenced by it, may be fairly taken to indicate that equal care had
 been bestowed upon the work during its preparation.
     There is another point connected with the mode of publication of
 works like the one at present under consideration, to which it is
worth while to direct attention. In Germany, where the publica
tion of elaborate scienti<U+FB01>c works is of considerably more frequent
occurrence than it is in this country, the usual practice, in the case
of works issued in a considerable number of separate Parts, is to
publish each Part as soon as it is ready, without attempting to make
the separate issues follow each other at perfectly regular intervals of
time. Consequently the purchasers of such works receive each por
tion with the smallest possible delay after the time of its actual com
position,—-a circumstance which is often by no means unimportant

when the subject treated of is a science in a state of such rapid
advance as Modern Chemistry. On the other hand, however, the
likelihood of the publication being spread over an unnecessarily long
period is greater under this system than when the publishers feel
that they are to some extent breaking faith with their subscribers if
a certain number of pages does not appear on a certain day. It
 thus sometimes happens that the beginning and the end of the same
 book represent very different stages in the development of a science,
 as in the case of the Handwiirterbuch der reinen und angewandten
 Chemie, the publication of which commenced in 1837, and is now
 nearly completed. In contrast with this system is that which has
 been adopted in the case of Mr. Watts’s Dictionary, and is the one
 usually adopted, as far as practicable, in the publication of English
 works of a similar character, namely, the issue of Parts of a uni
 form size at regular intervals of time. This mode of publication
 ensures the completion of the work within a limited period after the
 appearance of the <U+FB01>rst Part; but since it is necessary, in order to
 prevent subsequent delay, that the printing of the whole work should
 be far advanced before any portion is published, the earlier Parts
 must be already somewhat behind the actual state of the science by
 the time they reach the purchaser’s hands. The method of publica
 tion which would combine to the greatest possible extent the advan
 tages of the two foregoing systems, while excluding their disadvan
tages, would be, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to complete the manuscript of the
 whole work; then to proceed with the printing at such a rate as
would allow the author or editor ample time not only to correct the
press, but to make such alterations in or additions to each por
tion of copy, before delivering to the printer, as may have become
necessary since it was <U+FB01>rst written; lastly, to issue the work as fast
as it is printed, keeping the press only so much in advance of the
publication as may be deemed necessary to allow for accidental and
extraordinary delays.
    So far as we can judge by internal evidence, the composition of
 the volume before us appears to have been completed about the end of
 the year 1861, the latter portions showing but very few important
 omissions in respect to information published before that date; the
 matter contained in the <U+FB01>rst two or three Parts, on the other hand.
 has not always been brought down to a later date than about the
 end of 1859. Throughout the volume, however, the information
 contained in the various articles is very complete up to a certain
 point; so that it is only fair to suppose that the reason why the
 whole volume has not been completed up to a still later period, was
 the necessity of going early to press in order to render possible the
 rapid issue of the work. The value of a work of reference, con
 taining so great a mass of facts as this does, is of course not very
 materially lessened by its not containing a few more, if only it
 is complete in all important points so far as it goes, and this
 Mr. Watts’s Dictionary seems to be in an eminent degree. It
 would, however, often be a great convenience if every volume of
 such works bore, besides the date of publication, the date up

                     Notices rewecting New Books.                     309
to which the information contained in it is intended to be com
plete.
   The contributions to this volume of the Dictionary by other writers
than Mr. Watts, amount, according to a rough estimate, to about
310 pages, or to not much more than one quarter of the whole.
The names of the contributors of articles in this volume, arranged
according to the extent of their contributions, are :-—Mr. F. T.
Conington, who has written the articles on Amides,§ Amines, &c.,
Ammonia and its compounds, Inorganic Analysis, compounds of the
Anisic group, and compounds of the Benzoic group ; Mr. G. C. Foster,
author of Acids, Alkali, Alkaloids, Ammonium-bases, Anhydrides,
Classi<U+FB01>cation, and Czesium; Dr. Odling, author of Atomic Weights,
and the articles on Chlorine and its oxides and acids ; Dr. Atkinson,
author of Bismuth, Butgric, Capric, Caproic and Citric acids, and of
the articles on the compounds and derivatives of these substances;
Mr. W. S. Jevons, author of Balance, Barometer, and Clouds; Dr.
W. J . Russell, author of Analysis of Gases; Dr. Ditmar, author of
 Volumetric Analysis; the late Mr. C. E. Long, author of Blood and
 Casein; Mr. A.W.Wills, author of Coals and Coal- Gas; Dr. Roscoe,
 author ofzitmospkere; the late Dr. Alexander Ure, author of various
 short articles, chie<U+FB02>y descriptive of minerals (these articles are taken
from Dr. Ure’s Dictionary of ‘ Chemistry and Mineralogy,’ edit. 1831,
 of which Mr. Watts’s work was at <U+FB01>rst intended to be a new edition;
 but so completely has it been rewritten, that the whole of the arti
 cles retained in the <U+FB01>rst volume would scarcely occupy nine pages if
 collected together); and Dr. F. Guthrie, author of articles on the
 compounds and derivatives of Amgle.
   The above list illustrates to some extent the range of subjects
included in this work; but we ought further to point out that it is
really, as stated on the title-page, a “ Dictionary of the Allied
Branches of other Sciences ” as well as of Chemistry. Mineralogy
especially occupies a large share of space, Mr. Watts having appa
rently endeavoured to render his work a complete Dictionary of Che
mical Mineralogy, by giving, as far as possible, the locality, physical
characters, crystalline form, and analysis of every described mineral.
The results of the chemical investigation of plants are also very com
pletely recorded, including in all cases the published analyses of
their ashes,--a circumstance which will no doubt render the work
very valuable to agriculturists, at least to those who accept Liebig’s
mineral theory of agriculture.     Meteorology, again, is represented
in Mr. Jevons’s articles already mentioned on the Barometer and on
Clouds, which, as well as the same author's article on the Balance,
are among the very best in the volume. The principles involved in
the applications of chemistry to the purposes of every-day life (as in
the preparation of Beer and Bread), to Pharmacy, to Metallurgy and
£0 other manufacturing arts are also very fully elucidated, and
technical processes are described with as much detail as the nature
Of the work permits. Still another collateral subject which occu
pies a prominent place is Physiological Chemistry: among the more

310                 Notices respecting New Books.
important articles in this branch of the science, those on Bile, Blood,
and Chg/le may be mentioned.
   There are many other articles of a more purely chemical nature
which possess great value and interest. Among the number we
may mention particularly those on Combustion and Chemical/l<U+FB02>inity.
In the latter article, the distinctive characters of chemical action are
<U+FB01>rst considered, then its different kinds, next an account is given of
the various investigations that have been made in order to determine
the laws which regulate its amount, and lastly the various theories
which have been propounded, as to the nature of chemical ailinity,
are explained. Altogether this article forms the best treatise on
the subject with which we are acquainted. Nevertheless it is im
possible to read it without coming to the conclusion that the ascer
tained facts which throw any distinct light on the nature and mode
of action of the force which produces chemical action are very few
indeed: by far the most important is, no doubt, the constant quan
titative relation subsisting between chemical action and other forms
of energy. For this part of the subject we are referred to the arti
cles Heat and Electricity, where it will no doubt be fully discussed;
but we think that it might also have been treated with considerable
advantage from a chemical point of view.
   The most complete exposition, with which we are acquainted, of
the principles to be adopted in <U+FB01>xing the atomic weights of the
elementary bodies, is Dr. Odling's article Atomic Weights in this
volume. The author there sets forth with singular clearness the
various arguments, physical as well as chemical, which bear upon
the subject; and does not so much strive to illustrate the advan
tages of a particular system, as to explain the grounds upon which
any logical system must be based. We do not, however, agree with
his conclusion that Gerhardt’s scale of atomic weights affords asatis
factory representation of the present: state of knowledge; on the
contrary, we think that the consistent application of the spirit of
Gerhardt’s reforms would lead us now to go much further than
he did.
   Considering the very wide range of subjects included in this
volume, and the uniform excellence of the execution, so far as we
feel competent to form an opinion, it re<U+FB02>ects the very highest credit
upon the editor, and cannot fail to raise his already high reputation.
Watts’s ‘ Dictionary of Chemistry’ will doubtless long remain a
 standard work, and one of the most valuable in our language. It is
 from this conviction that we thought it worth while to indicate at
 the beginning of this notice one or two points connected with the
 issue of this volume, attention to which will, it may be hoped,
 ensure even greater excellence in its successors.

        " On the Absorption of Gases by Charcoal.—N0. I.”        By Dr.
R. Angus Smith, F.R.S.
   The following is a summary of the author’s observations :-—
   1. Charcoal absorbs oxygen so as to separate it from common air,
or from its mixtures with hydrogen and nitrogen, at common tempe
ratures.
   2. Charcoal continues the absorption of oxygen for at least a month,
although the chief amount is absorbed in a few hours, sometimes in
a few seconds, according to the quality of the charcoal.
   3. It does not absorb hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbonic acid for the
same period.
   4. Although the amount absorbed is somewhat in the relation of
the condensibility of the gases by pressure, this is not the only qua
lity regulating the absorption, of oxygen at least.
   5-. When it is sought to remove the oxygen from charcoal by
warmth, carbonic acid is formed, even at the temperature of boiling
water, and slowly even at lower temperatures.
   6. Charcoals di<U+FB02>'er extremely in absorbing power, and in the capa
city of uniting with oxygen, animal charcoal possessing the latter
property in a greater degree than wood-charcoal.
   7. Nitrogen and hydrogen, when absorbed by charcoal, diffuse
into the atmosphere of another gas with such force as to depress the
mercury three-quarters of an inch.
   8. Water expels mercury from the pores of charcoal by an instan
taneous action.
   9. The action of porous bodies is not indiscriminate but elective.
                       Theoretical Considerations.
   1. The elective nature of porous bodies may be closely allied to
three properties :—
      a. The condensibility of the gases.
      6. The attraction and perhaps inclination to combine.
      c. The capacity of combination.
   2. In either case the attraction which results in condensation of
the gas is exercised at distances greater than the distances of atoms
or molecules in combination.
   3. The gases in porous bodies lie in strata, the outside and more
distant being less attracted than the atoms nearer the solid body.
   4. We cannot separate chemical from physical attraction;         but
attraction may exist without its ultimate result (combination), which
18 distinctly chemical.
   5. It is exceedingly probable that as physical attraction moves

312                         Royal Society :—
onwards to chemical combination, it produces the phenomena which
have been attributed to so-called masses.
   Chemical a<U+FB02>inity is supposed to involve an attraction which is
purely chemical; we have no proof of any such attraction as a sepa
rate power, we have only a proof of the combination. Attraction
may exist without the capacity of combining chemically, or, in other
words, without chemical a<U+FB01>inity. Chemical a<U+FB01>inity (a very inap
propriate term) is only known by combination; the previous attrac
tion has never yet been shown to be of two kinds; and it seems more
in accordance with Nature to diminish than to increase the number
of original powers.

   “ On the Telescopic A_ppearance of the Planet Mars.” By John
Phillips, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
   Notwithstanding the descriptions and drawings of Mars, for which
we are indebted to eminent observers*, there remains much uncer
tainty as to the permanent boundaries of the bright and shady parts
of the planet, to which respectively, on a <U+FB01>rst view, we attach, per
haps too readily, the idea of land and seas.      The extremely variable
aspects under which this planet appears in its excentric orbit, the axis
being inclined more than 30° to the ecliptic, the different regions very
unequally presented to incident light, and very unequally in<U+FB02>uenced
by vicissitudes of heat and cold, may account for much of the uncer
tainty. Other di<U+FB01>iculties arise when the work of dilferent instru
ments is compared; for it is established that re<U+FB02>ectors will on the
whole give the best results for colour, while achromatics of <U+FB01>ne
quality discover more of detail than instruments of less perfect
de<U+FB01>nition.
   The author having devoted some evenings between the 27th of Sep
tember and 13th of December 1862 to the examination of Mars with
a 6-inch achromatic by Cooke, equatorially mounted, and moved by
clockwork, at Oxford, presented to the Society some results of these
observations combined with others, also made with achromatics, by
Mr. Grove, Mr. Main, and Mr. Lockyer.
   These various observations, made entirely without concert, were
rendered comparable by a calculated reduction of each to the longi
tude on Mars corresponding to the epoch of each, according to one
standard. [Tables of these reductions were given in the paper.]
The sketches were then arranged on sheets in the order of the com
pnted longitudes ; and, in addition, two globes were exhibited, on
one of which the main results of the author’s observations were drawn,
the data for the other being supplied by Mr. Lockyer’s sketches.

   He was also aided in the explanations b large drawings made
with re<U+FB02>ectors by Mr. De la Rue and Mr. asmyth.
   From the author’s sketches, three, representing opposite hemi
spheres, and one intermediate quadrature, have been selected for
engraving,—one central to the assumed meridian of 0° or 360°, the
others to the meridians of 90° and 180° nearly.        See <U+FB01>gs. l, 2, 3
(pp. 314, 315).
   On considering the surface of the planet, either as seen in the
telescope, or delineated on paper, we feel in some doubt as to the
meaning of what we see. Are the bright parts (often seen of a red
tint) land, the darker parts (often appearing of a greenish grey)
water’! or, as in the moon, are the re<U+FB02>ecting powers of different
parts of a dry surface very unequal? Is there any considerable
change in the aspect of the masses or boundaries between one epoch
and another, so as to indicate atmospheric vicissitudes like those
on Jupiter and our own planet?
   Taking the latter question <U+FB01>rst, the author found, on the experience
of his observations during 74 days, that no material change took
place in the main and prominent features about the longitude which
he marks 0°. Not that after this considerable interval the appear
ances remained exactly as at <U+FB01>rst: that was not, and could not be
expected to be the case, after the planet had increased his distance
from_the earth to nearly double that when the observations began.
Adding to his own the experience of Mr. Lockyer, whose observa
tions began 35 days earlier, this inference, of permanence in the
main boundaries of lights and shades, is extended to above l00
revolutions of Mars; and on comparison of these with the earlier
sketches of Miidler, Herschel, Jacobs, and De la Rue, the conclu
sion appears to embrace the whole series of more than thirty years
   The author regards as one of the main features very <U+FB01>rmly
de<U+FB01>ned in the late opposition, the broad white or rather reddish
band which from about 65° of north latitude (the north pole being
invisible in these observations) spreads up into large bright clQ11d
like prominences toward and beyond the equator, and retires 1I1t_0
one principal and several smaller bays toward the pole. From 171118
bright space, which in many parts is sharply de<U+FB01>ned, a broad dusky
tint spreads toward the south, partially relieved by half-lighted
expansions with shades of various depths between. The south pole
itself is surrounded (excentrically as it appears) by a bright white
mass, obviously glittering in the telescope.     This is believed to be
snow; and the effect of its whiteness is increased in most parts of its
circumference by the contrast of a dark ring round it, which ex
pands here and there into broader spaces. Thus a great part of the
northern area appeared in the late opposition bright, and often
reddish, as if it were land, while a great part of the southern area
was of the grey hue which is considered to indicate water, but
relieved by various tracts of a tint more or less approaching to that
of the brighter spaces of the northern hemisphere. The principal
boundary of light and shade, for the most part very well de<U+FB01>ned,
ran obliquely across the equator of Mars, so as to reach latitudes

    Allowing the white spaces to be land, which re<U+FB02>ects light as the
moon in opposition, it seems a natural supposition that the shady
spaces should be called sea; and this may be supported by the
obvious requirement of water somewhere on Mars, to agree with the
alternate gathering and melting of the snow round the poles.                   Still,
every observer remarks no small resemblance of some of these shady
tracts with particular parts of the unequally tinted grey surfaces of
the moon.       A positive proof of ocean on the disk of Mars would be
afforded by the star-like image of the sun re<U+FB02>ected from the quiet
surface-l", or the more diffused light thrown back from the waves;
   * The inclination of the axis of Mars to the observer was, on the 1st of October,
1862, 25$, as Mr. Main has informed me.
   1‘ The quiet image here alluded to would not exceed 915th of a second of angle
at the opposition, if no allowance be made for irradiation. But much allowance
must be made for this. A thermometer-bulb, with diameter half an inch, re<U+FB02>ects
the sun as a star visible by the eye at 25 yards’ distance, the re<U+FB02>ecting surface in
this case being about Ehth of an inch in diameter, and therefore (if no irradia
tion were allowed for) the angle subtended at the eye would be only about 1''.
By employing on Mars is power of 300, the 1,5," becomes relatively magni<U+FB01>ed
to 15".
   The re<U+FB02>ective power of water at a nearly vertical incidence is, however, so

but nothing of this sort has been placed on record, nor is there such
a variation in the appearance of these spaces from the centre toward
the edges as to give any special reason for thinking them occupied
by water.
   Atmospheric vicissitudes, however, appear to be recognized in the
somewhat variable aspect of many portions of the grey spaces; for
these, though not much changed in the situation of the masses of
light or shade, are su<U+FB01>iciently inconstant in their shapes and details
 to suggest the idea of a vaporous envelope, brooding over and
 about some      arts more than others, and variable from one epoch to
 another.     T e drawings of Mr. Lockyer supply the best evidence of
 these variations; for Professor Phillips, except on a few occasions,
 con<U+FB01>ned his attention chie<U+FB02>y to the stronger and apparently more
 settled boundaries of light and shade.
   The tints on the body of Mars were observed by each of the
gentlemen named, but with different results. To Mr. Nasmyth,
with a large re<U+FB02>ector, the ‘land’ appeared of a decidedly red tint,
the ‘water’ green. The ‘land’ appeared red in some parts, but
bright and almost silvery in other parts, to Professor Phillips, looking
through his achromatic, which also showed the ‘ water ’ of a grey or
greenish tint. No redness appeared in Mr. Lockyer’s instrument,
which, like many others of excellent quality for astronomical re
search, is intentionally ‘over-corrected.’
    Mr. Nasmyth saw the snow-patch on the south pole so distinctly
bordered, as to give him the impression of its having a eliti
boundary.       The south snow-patch did not appear to him -to agree
with the south pole of the planet, but, on the contrary, to be con
siderably excentric to it; and he supposed this to be due to the
relative distribution of land and water, in<U+FB02>uencing’ the position of               —‘_- _. _
the centre of greatest cold. Only a faint glimmering of the snowy
surfaces round the north pole was seen by any observer.
   On the whole, the author of this paper concluded that, over a per
manent basis of bright and dusky tracts on the surface of Mars, a
variable envelope gathers and <U+FB02>uctuates, partially modifying the
aspect of the fundamental features, and even in some cases disguising
them under new lights and shades, which present no constancy,-—a
thin vaporous atmosphere probably resting on a surface of land,
snow, and water.
                                  Addendum.
   Since the reading of the paper the author has been enabled, by the
kindness of the Earl of Rosse, to examine a series of sketches of
Mars during the late opposition, from the great telescopes at Birr.
These drawings, six in number, were made on July 22, Sept. 14,
Sept. 16, Oct. 6, Oct. 29, and Nov. 6. They con<U+FB01>rm in a remark
able manner the conclusions already presented by the author, and
much reduced, that Professor Phillips found it possible, under that condition, to
observe the sun’s image in water without in protecting dark glass.    It seems pro
bable, therefore, that even in very large re<U+FB02>ectors the direct solar re<U+FB02>exion from
water on Mars would be too faint for observation.—Feb. 17, 1863.

suggest some interesting questions for further observation and study.
On the 22nd of July the southern snow was a large, patch, meeting
the limb by its diametral line. It must then have had a radius of
500 miles at least : in the later observations it was reduced to less
than half this measure.             _
   One of the drawings nearly corresponds to longitude 180° on
the author’s scale, and represents the specially dark short band
which distinguishes that aspect of the planet (<U+FB01>g. 3). Two corre
spond nearly to <U+FB01>g. 1, and contain the_ remarkable deep angular bay
which extends so far towards the north pole. In these and the re
maining three drawings, general resemblances and special differences
appear on comparison with the sketches of Prof. Phillips and Mr.
Lockyer. The differences affect principally the grey southern parts,
and are remarkable enough to justify serious doubts whether any of
our drawings of those parts are much to be trusted as representing
permanent physical boundaries. Nor should this be thought sur
prising; owing to the high inclination of the axis of Mars to the plane
of his orbit, the regions round each pole are presented alternately to
the sun through periods somewhat less than our whole year.            The
effect is seen in the vast outspread of snows round the cold pole, and
the contraction of those white sheets to a small glittering ellipse
round the warm pole.       The enormous transfer of moisture from one
hemisphere to the other while the snows are melting round one pole
and growing round the other must generate over a great part of the
planet heavy storms and great breadths of <U+FB02>uctuating clouds, which
would not, as on the quickly rotating mass of Jupiter, gather into
equatorial bands, but be more under the in<U+FB02>uence of prominent land
and irregular tracts of ocean.

    “On Thallium.” By William Crookes, Esq.
   After discussing the occurrence and distribution of the new metal
in different parts of the globe, the author proceeds to describe the
method adopted by him for extracting it from its ore. Thalli
ferous pyrites is distilled at a bright red heat, in quantities of about
 1 cwt. at a time, in cast-iron retorts. The resulting sulphur, vary
ing from 13 to 17 per cent. of the pyrites taken, is then dissolved
in aqueous caustic soda, which leaves the sulphide of thallium as
an insoluble black precipitate ; this is <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>', dissolved in acids,
and the thallium precipitated in the form of iodide. This is then
converted into sulphate, and the metal reduced from the solution by
electrolysis. It is obtained in the coherent form by fusion under
cyanide of potassium.
   The physical characteristics of thallium are then described. In
appearance it most resembles tin and cadmium, but has a distinct
 colour of its own; it has a brilliant metallic lustre, and is susceptible
 of taking a very high polish ; it oxidizes in the air with almost the
 rapidity of an alkaline metal, but when coated with oxide, the metal

      318                         Royal Society :—
      may be freely handled and exposed to the air with scarcely any
      further change. An oxidized surface applied to the tongue is very
      biting and caustic, and has a sweetish metallic taste. It is the
      softest known metal admitting of free exposure to the atmosphere,
      being scratched by soft lead with the greatest ease. It makes a
      dark blue mark upon paper, rapidly turning yellow, which in the
      course of a few hours nearly fades out, but can be restored with
     sulphide of ammonium.          It has little tenacity, is very malleable,
     and may be readily pressed into wire.
         The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of thallium varies from 1181 to l1'9l, and
      it is probably capable of still greater condensation.
         When freshly prepared, thallium wire is perfectly amorphous,
     but when kept in water it gradually assumes a super<U+FB01>cial crystalline
     appearance: this e<U+FB02>'ect is immediately produced when thallium in
     wire, ingot, or plate, tarnished or clean, is boiled in water.
         Its melting-point is 550° F., being between bismuth and lead,
     and the metal does not become pasty before undergoing complete
     fusion. Two pieces of clean metal weld together by pressure in the
     cold.    It begins to volatilize at a red heat, and boils below a white
     heat; it may be distilled in a current of hydrogen.
         It is a pretty good conductor of heat and electricity, and stands
     electro-chemically very near cadmium.         It is strongly diamagnetic,
     ranking in this respect near bismuth.        The alloys which thallium
__1 forms with different metals are next described.
   l Further details are given respecting the spectrum of thallium:
     the characteristic green line is perfectly single under a very high
     magnifying power and after refraction through nine heavy glass
     prisms; and no new lines make their appearance at the temperature
     of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe,—although, with the electric spark,
     Dr. Miller has shown that several new lines come into existence.
         The delicacy of the optical test for thallium is roughly estimated,
    the m@ of a grain being easily perceptible.
        The atomic weight of thallium is given as 203, being the mean of
    <U+FB01>ve experiments. The author states, however, that this is _not to
    be regarded as a <U+FB01>nal result.
        The chemical properties of thallium are next described.        It does
    not decompose water even at the boiling-point, but remains bright
    under this liquid. The super<U+FB01>cial tarnish is a powerful base so
    luble in water, and reacting like an alkaline solution. Melted in
    the air, thallium forms a readily fusible oxide, its behaviour re
    sembling that of lead.
        The formation of thallic acid and the properties of some of the
    thallates are described.     Sulphate, nitrate, the chlorides, sulphide,
    iodide, and other salts of thallium are described in detail. The
    metal may be quantitatively determined by precipitation, either as
    protochloride, iodide, or platinochloride.
        The position of thallium amongst elementary bodies is then dis
    cussed. Although one or two of its properties show a resemblance
    to the alkaline metals, the author does not agree with continental
    chemists in classing it with this group,—numerous facts proving

     On the Lines in the Spectra of some of the Fixed Stars.          319
that its true position is by the side of mercury, lead, or silver. The

         chloride, bromide,              the insolubility

ferrocyanide; its great atomic weight; its ready reduction by zinc
to the metallic state; its power of forming a strongly acid oxide;
and, according to Dr. Miller, the complexity of its photographic
spectrum,—all prove that thallium cannot consistently be classed
anywhere but amongst the heavy metals, mercury, silver, lead, &c.
No weight is attached to M. Dumas’s argument in favour of thallium
being related to potassium and sodium because its equivalent is
rather near a <U+FB01>gure obtained by adding twice the atomic weight
of one metal to four times the atomic weight of the other. The
author shows that, by similar processes of addition, multiplication,
or subtraction, it is not di<U+FB01>icult to prove that thallium is related
to any desired group of elements.
   The author gives full analytical notes on thallium, showing where
it would occur in the ordinary course of analysis, and detailing
accurate methods of separating it from every metal with which it
can be accompanied.

   The recent detailed examination of the solar spectrum, and the
remarkable observations of Kirchhoff upon the connexion of the
dark lines of Fraunhofer with the bright lines of arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>ames,
having imparted new interest to the investigation of spectra, it has
appeared to the authors of the present note that the Royal Society
may not consider a brief account of their recent inquiry upon the
spectra of some of the self-luminous bodies of the heavens unworthy
of attention, although the investigation is as yet far from complete.
   After devoting considerable time to the construction of apparatus
suitable to this delicate branch of inquiry, they have at length
succeeded in contriving an arrangement which has enabled them
to view the lines in the stellar spectra in much greater detail than
has been <U+FB01>gured or described by any previous observer. The
apparatus also permits of the immediate comparison of the stellar

 the telescope is carried very smoothly by a clock motion.
    It may further be stated that the position in the stellar spectra
 corresponding to that of Fraunhofer’s line D, from which the others
 are measured, has been obtained by coincidence with a sodium line,
 the position of which in the apparatus was compared directly with the
 line D in the solar spectrum.

 together with descriptions of the new species of plants discovered,
 were given in this paper,—as also were some new and important

to belong to Demlrerpeton Oweni, H3/Ionomus W3/mani, and H. L]/elli.
He also gave restorations of these animals, according to what he
regarded as the more probable arrangement of the parts; and, after
expressing his belief that Hylonomus may have Lacertian a<U+FB02>inities,

the Lowest Devonian.

   “ On the Section at Moulin-Quignon, and on the peculiar
character of some of the Flint Implements found there.” By J.
Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   The recent discovery of a. human jaw and of <U+FB02>int implements of a
peculiar type and fresh appearance at Moulin-Quignon has led to
questions having been lately raised as to the age of the gravel-beds,
and the antiquity of these remains. Mr. Prestwich showed how con
<U+FB02>icting had been the evidence in support of the views formerly
entertained, and dwelt upon the appearances which had raised the
doubts as to the genuineness of certain implements and the fossil
nature of the jaw. He also gave a résumé of the proceedings of the
Conference lately held at Paris and Abbeville, and remarked that
the intrinsic evidence appeared to prove the spurious nature of the
objects, while the evidence derived from the study of the beds had
led to the opposite conclusion.
   The author then showed that, from the physical con<U+FB01>guration of
the district, corroborated by the presence of extinct mammalia dis
tinctly of contemporaneous age, the modern age assigned to these
beds by some geologists could not be maintained, and that, from
the occurrence of freshwater shells in both the high- and low-level
gravels, their formation must have been due to river-action, and not
to a wave of translation or other modi<U+FB01>cation of marine action.
   Mr. Prestwich concluded by stating that, whatever may be the
conclusions drawn from the jaw and the <U+FB02>int implements, the age of
the deposits is to him perfectly well determined as being of the early
quaternary or post-pliocene period, older than the Menchecou<U+FB02>

         ON THE EABTH,S CLIMATE IN PALIEOZOIC TIMES.
                   BY T. STERRY HUNT, M.A., FJLS.
 VPHE late researches of Tyndall on the relation of gases and
       vapours to radiant heat are important in their bearing upon the
 temperature of the earth's surface in former geological periods.
 He has shown that heat, from -whatever source, passes through
hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases, or through dry air, with
nearly the same facility as through a vacuum. These gases are thus
to radiant heat what rock-salt is among solids. Glass and some
 other solid substances, which are readily permeable to light and
to solar heat, offer, as is well known, great obstacles to the passage
of radiant heat from non-luminous bodies; and Tyndall has recently
shown that many colourless vapours and gases have a similar effect,
 intercepting the heat from such sources, by which they become
 warmed, and in their turn radiate heat. Thus while for a vacuum
 the absorption of heat from a body at 212° F. is represented by 0,
and that for dry air is l, the absorption by an atmosphere of car
bonic acid gas equals 90, by marsh-gas 403, by ole<U+FB01>ant gas 970,
and by ammonia 1195. The diffusion of ole<U+FB01>ant gas of one inch
tension in a vacuum produces an absorption of 90, and the same
amount of carbonic acid gas an absorption of 5'6. The small quanti
ties of ozone present in electrolytic oxygen were found to raise
its absorptive power from 1 to 85, and even to 136; and the watery
vapour present in the air at ordinary temperatures in like manner
produces an absorption of heat represented by 70 or 80. Air satu
rated with moisture at the ordinary temperature absorbs more than
-<U+FB01>ve hundredths of the heat radiated from a metallic vessel <U+FB01>lled with
boiling water; and Tyndall calculates that of the heat radiated from
the earth’s surface warmed by the sun's rays, one-tenth is inter
cepted by the aqueous vapour within ten feet of the surface. Hence
the powerful in<U+FB02>uence of moist air upon the climate of the globe.
Like a covering of glass, it allows the sun’s rays to reach the earth,
but prevents to a great extent the loss by radiation of the heat thus
communicated.
   When, however, the supply of heat from the sun is interrupted
 during long nights, the radiation which goes on into space causes
 the precipitation of a great part of the watery vapour from the air,
 and the earth, thus deprived of this protecting shield, becomes more
 and more rapidly cooled. If now we could suppose the atmosphere
 to be mingled with some permanent gas which should possess an
 absorptive power like that of the vapour of water, this cooling pro

cess would be in a great measure arrested, and an effect would be
produced similar to that of a screen of glass, which keeps up the
temperature beneath it, directly by preventing the escape of radiant
heat, and indirectly by hindering the condensation of the aqueous
vapour in the air con<U+FB01>ned beneath.
   Now we have only to bear in mind that there are the best of
reasons for believing that, during the earlier geological periods, all
of the carbon since deposited in the forms of limestone and of mine
ral coal existed in the atmosphere in the state of carbonic acid, and
we see at once an agency which must have aided greatly to produce
the elevated temperature that prevailed at the earth's surface in for
mer geological periods. Without doubt the great extent of sea, and
the absence or rarity of high mountains, contributed much towards
the mild climate of the carboniferous age (for example) when a vege
tation as luxuriant as that now found in the tropics <U+FB02>ourished within
the frigid zones; but to these causes must be added the in<U+FB02>uence of
the whole of the carbon which was afterwards condensed in the form
of coal and carbonate of lime, and which then existed in the condi
tion of a transparent and permanent gas, mingled with the atmo
sphere, surrounding the earth, and protecting it like a dome of glass.
To this effect of carbonic acid it is possible that other gases may
have contributed. The ozone, which is mingled with the oxygen set
free from growing plants, and the marsh-gas, which is now evolved
from decomposing vegetation under conditions similar to those then
presented by the coal-<U+FB01>elds, may by their great absorptive power
have very well aided to maintain at the earth's surface that high
temperature the cause of which has been one of the enigmas of
geology.

  ON SOME PHENOMENA PRODUCED BY THE REFRACTIVE POWER
                OF THE EYE.     BY A. CLAUDET, F.R.S.*
    One of the most beautiful and extraordinary results of the struc
ture of the human eye is the considerable <U+FB01>eld of vision it embraces.
The external objects which are represented on the retina are included
.in an angle much larger than one-half of the sphere at the centre of
 which the observer is placed; and from this point of view a single
 glance encompasses a vast and splendid panorama, extending in a
 horizontal and vertical direction to an angle of 200°.
    If we lie on the ground, we see the whole vault of the sky, and
 10° all round lower than the horizon. In that position, having our
 face directed to the zenith, if, at the time of opposition, the moon
 was just rising in the east, and the sun setting in the west, we could
 see simultaneously the moon with one eye and the sun with the
 other; and, although both forming actually an angle of 180°, they
 would appear to form one only of 160°.

 ciation Meeting, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, August 27, 1863.

   The <U+FB01>eld of vision of each eye subtends an angle of 200°, but it
is reduced on one side in the horizontal direction according to the
projection of the nose. It is also reduced in the vertical line accord
ing to the projection of the frontal bone.
    With the two eyes, the shadow of the nose, being in an opposite
position for each of them when the two eyes are open, does not
impede the full range of vision, which embrace the whole extent
of 200°.
    To explain how the optical combination of the eye can form on
the retina an image of 200°, we have to assume that the rays of
light in passing through the cornea and the crystalline lens are more
and more refracted in proportion to the angle at which they strike
the spherical surface of the cornea. By this refraction the rays
which enter the eyes at an angle of 90° are bent 10°, and appear to
come from an angle of 80°.
   This phenomenon, which I have not seen noticed in any treatise
on optics, produces a very curious illusion. When we are lighted
by the sun, the moon, or any other light, if we endeavour to place
ourselves in such a position that the front of the body should be
on a line with its own shadow and with the light which produces
it, if we look straight before us we see unexpectedly with one eye
the light and with the other the shadow of our body ; and although
they must form an angle of 180°, they appear by the refraction to
form one of only 160°. In fact the light and the shadow do not
seem to be connected at all; instead of being in a line they appear
bent to an angle. The shadow seems to come not from the light
we actually see, but from one which ought to be a little behind
us; and as to the light, it seems that it should only be capable
of forming the shadow of our body enough behind us to be invi
sible.   In other words, the ray of light and the shadow which
ought to coincide and form only one line, are bent by the refractive
power of the eye, like the stick, one half of which being immersed
in water, appears crooked or bent into an angle at the point of
immersion.
   This curious phenomenon evidently proves that the process of
vision is affected by the common law of refraction, and that the
only objects which appear in their true position are those the image
of which, entering the eye in the direction of the optic axis, undergo
no refraction.
   So that mathematically we see in their right place only the objects
which re<U+FB02>ect their light on the centre of the retina, and all the other
objects are more and more refracted as they enter the eye in a more
and more oblique direction. Therefore the panoramic picture which
is represented on the retina is correct only in the centre of this
organ, and all the other parts of the picture are seen not exactly
where they are. But this is no imperfection in the general eifect, as
it does not affect in the least the perception of the picture, because,
as we have only a distinct vision for the parts which are represented
on the centre of the retina, when we want to see the whole pano
rama we have to direct gradually the optic axis upon the various

326             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
parts of which it is composed. By this means, and the rapidity of
the motion of the eye, we have always a correct perception of the
whole, and gradually we see every part of the picture in its true
position.
   The representation on the retina of a whole <U+FB01>eld of 200° is one
of the innumerable and wonderful resources of Nature-in this case
being a contrivance by which the beauty of the e<U+FB02>'ect is increased,
and by which our attention is gradually called to the various
parts which, although not exactly in the direction of the optic axis,
and even very far from it, are su<U+FB01>iciently conspicuous and appear to
form an interesting or, in any way, a desirable point of observation.
By means of this extensive <U+FB01>eld of vision we are warned of any
danger from objects coming to us in the most oblique direction. If
a furious animal were running from behind we should see it as soon
as it had reached an angle of 100° with the optic axis, and this would
enable us to take immediate measures for ‘our safety. But the
advantages of an enlarged <U+FB01>eld of vision are particularly felt in our
crowded towns, where we are obliged to be constantly on the look
out for all that is passing around us.
   In every respect the vision of the eyes is as complete and as
perfect as can be imagined, and we cannot improve it arti<U+FB01>cially
by single or even double achromatic glasses, which, although mag
nifying considerably the objects, cannot embrace a <U+FB01>eld larger than
the angle formed by the lens at the distance of the eye-glass.
With a telescope, if we have the advantage of enlarging a small
part of the landscape, we lose the fulness and extent of its pano
ramic beauty.
   Notwithstanding all the resources of the science of optics, no
arti<U+FB01>cial instrument can approach the perfection of the eye; and it
has not yet been given to man even to understand satisfactorily
all the laws in accordance with which this marvellous organ has been
created, or how it can perform so many wonderful things.

  THE STAR CHROMATOSCOPE 2 AN INSTRUMENT TO EXAMINE AND
     COMPARE THE RAYS OF THE STARS. BY A. CLAUDET, F.R.S.*
    The scintillation of the stars is probably due to the evolution, in
 different degrees of swiftness, of the various rays their light emits.
 These rays seem to divide during their long and rapid course
 through space, as if they were dispersed by a refractive medium,
 and we see them following each other in quick succession. The
 change is so instantaneous that, although we see distinctly the
 various colours, we cannot judge of the separate lengths of their
 duration.
    It has occurred to me that if we could increase on the retina the
 length of the sensation produced by each ray, we should have the
 better means of examining them separately, of comparing their
 intensities, and the length of every vibration.
    The retina having the power of retaining the sensation of light
 during a fraction of time, which has been found to be one-third of a
 second, one ray succeeds another before the entire sensation is
 exhausted; so that, supposing the seven rays reach the eye in
 the third part of a second, two or more sensations are felt at the
 same moment, and consequently the perception is mixed and con
 fused, although the predominating ray is more conspicuous. But if,
 while a ray is acting upon one part of the retina, we could bring the
 next ray on another part, so dividing the sensations, we should be
 enabled to avoid their confusion, and to compare the colour and
 duration of each.
    If this were done, and moreover, if we could not only separate
 the various sensations, but make them travel on the retina during
 the whole time that each sensation lasts, we should have a. still
 better means of comparison.
   This problem may be solved by transforming the in<U+FB01>nitely small
spot of the star into a large circle, as can be done with an incan
descent charcoal at the end of a wire rapidly revolving round a cen
tre. Itwas
lution        evolvingthat
           is obvious      if the incandescent
                       successively             charcoal
                                     various rays,       during

length and duration of every ray by the angle each would subtend
during its course.
   This is precisely what can be done with the light of the star. It
can be made to revolve like the incandescent charcoal, and form a
complete circle on the retina.
   When we look at a star with a telescope, we see it <U+FB01>xed on one
de<U+FB01>nite part of the <U+FB01>eld of the glass ; but if with one hand we slightly
move the telescope, the image of the star changes its position; and
during that motion, on account of the persistence of sensation on the
retina, instead of appearing like a spot, it assumes the shape of a
continued line. Now ‘if, instead of moving the telescope in straight
line, we endeavour to move it in a. circular direction, the star appears

like acircle, but very irregular, on account of the unsteadiness of the
 movement communicated by the hand.
    Such is the principle that has led me to the construction of the
instrument I am going to describe, and which communicates the
perfect circular motion that it is impossible to impart by the hand.
    I establish on the top of a stand a conical tube, lying horizontally
at each end upon two vertical wheels, by which it is steadily sup
ported. These wheels revolve in a groove, cut on the tube at each
 of its extremities. By means of these grooves, and the wheels on
which the tube is supported, we can make it revolve freely and
regularly upon its axis. In the middle of the tube there is another
groove, in which an india-rubber ring is enrolling itself and from
thence passing on a large grooved wheel which, being turned by
means of a crank, impresses a rotatory motion on the tube. Inside
the tube I place a small telescope or an opera-glass, the eye-glass of
which is exactly centrical with the small end of the conical tube;
while the object-glass is placed in an eccentric position by means of
two screws <U+FB01>xed on the two extremities of the diameter of the large
 end of the tube. The axis of the telescope can be so inclined as to
 take various degrees of eccentricity, so that, while the whole machine
 makes the conical tube revolve upon its axis, the axis of the tele
scope revolves round the former in an eccentric direction.
    The eccentric motion of the telescope is such that any star cor
responding with the axis of the external tube is refracted through the
object-glass, and its rays dispersed as if that object--glass were a re
volving prism; and during that revolution the image of the star
describes upon the retina a circle proportionate to the eccentricity of
 the telescope.
    If, while the telescope is revolving, we look into it with one eye,
 we may with the other see the star; and from this binocular vision
we have the phenomenon of a star revolving round another star,
forming a perfect luminous circle with a luminous point at its cen
 tre. This is a very curious observation, independently of the more
 curious and interesting object of the instrument, which is to deve
lope an in<U+FB01>nitely small spot of light into a large circle, exhibiting on
its periphery the various rays emitted by the star, all following each
other in spaces corresponding with their duration -—s.howing also
blank spaces between two contiguous rays, which must correspond
with the black lines of the spectrum.       We have, in fact, a kind of
spectroscope, by which we can analyse the particular light of any
star; and, further, by this instrument we may arrive at the discovery
of the real cause of the scintillation, and compare its intensity in
various climates and at different altitudes of a given star. At all
events the instrument will be found to be a curious application of
optics, and in proper hands may perhaps afford the means of making
many interesting observations and experiments upon the constitution
and properties of the light of the stars, so di<U+FB02>icult to examine by the
spectroscope. I hope the idea will be fruitful, and not end trivially
in the contrivance of a mere scienti<U+FB01>c toy.

 XLVII. On the Numerical Expression of the Destructive Energy
    in the Explosions of Steam-boilers, and on its comparison with
    the Destructive Energy of Gunpowder. By GEORGE BIDDELL
    AIBY, Astronomer Royal*.
 1. A LITTLE consideration of the changes in the state of the
            water and steam, which occur during the bursting of a
 steam-boiler, will show that very little of the destructive effect
 of an explosion is due to the steam which is contained in the
steam-chamber at the moment of the explosion. The rupture
of the boiler is e<U+FB02>ected by the expansive power common at the
moment to the steam and the water, both at a temperature
higher than the boiling-point; but as soon as steam escapes,
and thereby diminishes the compressive force upon the water, a
new issue of steam takes place from the water, reducing its tem
perature; when this escapes, and further diminishes the com
pressive force, another issue of steam of lower elastic force from
the water takes place, again reducing its temperature; and so
on ; till at length the temperature of the water is reduced to the
atmospheric boiling-point, and the pressure of the steam (or
rather the excess of steam-pressure over atmospheric pressure) is
reduced to 0. It is the enormous quantity of steam, of gradu
ally diminishing power, which is thus produced from water during
the course of the explosion, that causes the disastrous effects of
the explosion: compared with this quantity, the small volume of
gas which may happen to be in the steam-chamber at the time
is, in boilers of ordinary construction, wholly insigni<U+FB01>cant, and
                                                                   \

gations.
    2. If we compare the course of changes, in bursting, in two
 boilers, a large one and a small one, we see that the order of
changes is the same in both; but that to reduce the tempera
ture of a large body of water by a certain number of degrees
a large volume of steam must escape, whereas, to reduce the
temperature of a small body of water by the same number of
degrees, it will su<U+FB02>ice that a smaller volume of steam (smaller
in the same proportion as the bulk of water) escape. Thus it
will appear that the whole volume of escaping steam at a given
pressure, and the whole destructive energy of the steam, are
proportional to the bulk of water.
    3. For measure of the destructive energy of the steam, we
 must suppose the simplest and most easily measurable case——
namely, that the steam, in expanding, drives a piston along a
uniform cylinder. It is necessary to ascertain the value of the
pressure F when the steam has expanded so far as to have pushed
the piston to the distance .r: then the measure of the total energy
issdzc. F, the integral being taken from the point where the piston
was in contact with the water to the point where the excess of
pressure of the steam above atmospheric pressure =0.
    4. In thecase of gunpowder <U+FB01>red in a cannon, where the
weight of the ball and its velocity on emergence are found by
experiment, the energy of the gunpowder as acting on the ball
will be thus found. The pressure at distance y being F’, acting
on a ball whose weight is W, and g being the numerical measure
of the acceleration produced in one second of time by gravity
(_q=32'1908 if the unit of measure is the English foot, or
 =9'8ll6 if the unit is the French metre), 0 being the velocity
at distance 3/, and V the whole velocity acquired, then the acce
leration is %‘,—g,

total energy = Vl%. And if w be the weight of the gun
powder, the encrgy of one unit-weight of gunpowder =
   5. Several years ago (before 1849) I had desired in this way
to compare the destructive energy of steam from a bursting
boiler with that of gunpowder; and I had requested the assist
ance of my friend Professor W. H. Miller of Cambridge (to
whose knowledge of the progress of accurate science in every

         of the Destructive        in Steam-boiler Explosions.  331
  department of physics I have often been indebted), to enable me
  to give numerical values to the expressions involved. At that
  epoch, however, the theories and experiments on steam were not
  su<U+FB02>iciently advanced, and I was compelled to lay aside the
  inquiry for a time.
     6. In the spring of the present year I requested Messrs.
  Ransomes and Sims, of Ipswich, to furnish me with an experi
  mental result on the quantity of water escaping from a high
 pressure boiler in the form of steam when the valve is gradually
 opened. This experiment was undertaken by George A. Biddell,
 Esq., Engineering Superintendent of the Orwell Works. The
 result was that, when the bulk 22 cubic feet of water in a loco
 motive boiler was raised to the temperature which produced a
 pressure of 60 lbs. per square inch, and when after raking out
 the <U+FB01>re the valve was gradually opened with every precaution
 against priming, the quantity of water which escaped in the
 form of steam was 2% cubic feet, or one-eighth of the whole.
    7. Possessed of this experimental fact, I again referred to
 Professor Miller for such theories and citations of experiments
 as might be required. And by his kind assistance I was enabled
 to complete the investigation. And here I may‘ state that the
 whole which follows is Professor Miller’s, with the exception of
 the integration of the steam-pressures, the inference from the
 cannon-experiments, and the comparison of steam and gun
 powder.
    8. In giving the heads of Professor Miller’s theory, I must
 premise that the temperatures are Centigrade, the unit of linear
measure is the metre, and the unit of weight is the kilogramme.
The formula adopted as connecting the volume of steam with
the volume of water (at maximum density) from which it was
generated, is Fairbairn’s and Tate’s (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 219).
The formula for the number of calories required to convert
water into saturated steam of temperature T, and the pressure of
saturated steam at temperature T, are from Regnault (Mémoires
de l’Institut, vol. xxi. pp. 748 and 728).
    9. The <U+FB01>rst part of Professor Miller’s investigation applies to
Mr. Biddell’s experiment. The steam-pressure of 60 lbs. per
square inch is represented by a column of mercury (at 0°)
3'1028 metres in height. Adding the atmospheric pressure
0'76 metre, the entire elastic force of the steam is represented
by a column of mercury 3'8628 metres in height.          The corre
sponding temperature of saturated steam, by Regnault’s Table,
is l52°'8¢L.    Now the quantity of water is 22 cubic feet, which
at 100° weigh 597'1 kilogs., and the heat requisite to raise the
temperature of this water from 0° to 152°'84 is 597'1 X 154r38
calories (the last number being derived from Regnault’s formula

T + 000002 '1‘2 + 00000003 T“,        where T for this instance
=l52'84), or 92182 calories. When all the steam has been
blown off, the 5971 kilogs. of water are separated into wkilogs.
of steam at 100°, and (597'1 -22) kilogs. of water at 100°. [This
applies strictly when the steam has blown into a cylinder and
has driven a piston, because then there may be such intercom
munication of temperature between the portions of steam as will
ensure that the <U+FB01>nal state of the steam is that of saturated steam
at 100°; it is probably true or very approximate when the steam
has blown out at different temperatures and has been lost in the
atmosphere] To heat (597 '1—.z*) kilogs. of water from 0° to
 100° requires (597'1 —.z') X 100'5 calories;     and to convert
:0 kilogs. of water at 0° into steam at 100° requires (606'5
 +O'305 X 100) x w calories (by a formula of Regnault’s). Sup
posing, then, that the amount of heat as measured by the num
ber of calories is not altered by the blowing out from the boiler,
              92182: (5971 —.z') x 100-5 + 637 >4 .2‘,
whence .2, the weight blown out as steam, =59'8.        This, how
ever, is equivalent to only 2'2 cubic feet of water, instead of
2'75, the quantity which Mr. Biddell found to have passed
 away in steam.
    10. Professor Miller supposes the difference to be caused
 principally by the heat of the mass of iron which surrounds the
water ; any burning fuel which may have been left in the <U+FB01>re
box would add slightly to its effect. It appears best therefore
to assume the experimental fact, and to infer from it what quan
tity of heated water we ought to add (in investigations) to the
quantity of water really present in the boiler, in order to pro
duce correctly the amount of water which in the experiment
was blown out as steam. Now 2'75 cubic feet of water at 100°
weigh 74'638 kilogs.      Let 3/ represent the number of kilogs. in
the bulk of water which may be considered equivalent to the
compound consisting of 22 cubic feet of water, the unknown
weight of iron, and the unknown quantity of fuel. To heat 3/
kilogs. of water from 0° to 152°'84 requires 15438 x y calories;
and this is the amount of heat in the complex equivalent before
blowing off. To heat (_1/—74i'638) kilogs. of water from 0° to
100° requires (y-7'4='638) x 1005 calories; and to convert
74'638 kilogs. of water at 0° into steam at 100° requires
74!'638X 637 calories; and the aggregate of this with the last,
or (y—74'638) x 1005 + 74638 x 637, represents the number
of calories in the complex equivalent after the blowing 05.
Making this equal to the number before blowing off,
        1541'38 X 3/: (y—74'638) x 100'5 + 74'638 X 637,
whence y: 7432.

         of the Destructive Energy in Steam-boiler Explosions.  333
    Comparing this with the weight of the 22 cubic feet of water
  alone, or 597'1 kilogs., it appears that the heated materials
  extraneous to the water produce the effect of 14.<6'1 kilogs.
  of water.
      11. Assuming then that there are really 743'2 kilogs. of
  heated water, the investigation of the destructive energy pro
  ceeds thus. To heat 743-2 kilogs. of water from 0° to l52°'84
  requires 7'43'2 X 15438 calories = 114740 calories; and this is
  the quantity of heat for which we must account in every stage of
 the expansion, when the steam is allowed to blow into a cylinder
 and drive a piston before it. Now at any instant let 111 be the
  number of kilogs. of water converted into saturated steam ; T the
  common temperature of the water and steam ; Q,'r the number of
 calories required to heat 1 kilog. of water from 0° to T; M the
 number of calories required to convert 1 kilog. of water at 0° into
 steam at T; PT the pressure of saturated steam at T in milli
  metres of mercury at 0° ; KT the same pressure in kilogrammes
  per square décimétre (all which are given for numerical values
 of T by Regnault) ; VT the ratio of the volume of saturated steam
 under pressure PT to the volume of the water at 0° from which
 that team is derived (which is given by Fairbairn’s formula).
 Then, forming the expressions for the number of kilogs. of water
 and steam respectively, and multiplying each by its correspond
 ing number of calories, and equating the aggregate to the original
 number of calories,
                  ll4740= (743'2—w) x QT +w x M-.
 From this formula, with any assigned numerical value of T, w
 (the number of kilogrammes of water converted into steam) is
 found in numbers. And VT, the, ratio of the volume of the
 steam generated to that of the water from which it is generated,
 is taken in numbers from Fairbairn’s formula. And. a kilo
 gramme of water occupies one cubic décimétre of volume. There
fore the volume of steam, in cubic décimetres, is w x VT, of which
 w are left in the boiler to occupy the place of the expanded water ;
 and the volume of_steam expelled from the boiler is w X (V-1~—1)
                             '11)
in cubic décimetres, or           X (V-[-1) in cubic metres;
                            1000
    12. Suppose now that the steam in escaping enters a cylin
der whose section is 1 square metre, driving a piston before it.
Let z be the distance to which the piston has travelled (the unit
being the metre).       Then z= i»(€<U+FB01> x (V-1--1).     And the pres
sure of the steam on the piston (the unit being the kilogramme)
is 100x KT. Therefore the two elements, the distance of the
piston and the pressure upon it, can be calculated numerically

334       The Astronomer Royal on the Numerical Eapression
for any number of numerical values of T. To <U+FB01>nd the effective
pressure, the pressure <U+FB01>rst found must be diminished by the
atmospheric pressure, or by the pressure of steam at 100°, and
it thus becomes 100 x (K-;~—Km).       The limit of the length of
the cylinder will be determined by <U+FB01>nding where the steam
pressure = atmospheric pressure. By Fairbairn’s formula, 74638
kilogs. of saturated steam at 100° (the quantity which escaped
in Mr. Biddell’s experiment) occupy l22'28 cubic metres: of
this, 00746 cubic metre remains in the boiler, taking the place
of the water from which it was produced; the whole volume
expelled is therefore 122'21 cubic metres, and the limiting
length of the cylinder is 12221 linear metres.
    13. By these methods Professor Miller calculated the follow
ing corresponding values of 2, the distance to which the piston
has travelled (the unit being the metre), and F the effective
pressure on the piston (the unit being the kilogramme). The
degrees of temperature are also given, as they are the elements
from which 2 and F are computed; but they are not in any way
used in the subsequent calculations.

(for instance) by the momentum communicated to a material
piston, will be represented by the integral S112 . F. As the sym
bolical form of the function F is not known, it is necessary to
perform the integration by quadrature. For this purpose I laid
down the twelve data of this Table graphically (taking 2 as the
abscissa, and F as the ordinate), and drew a curve by hand
through the points so de<U+FB01>ned. Then I measured the ordinate
for each of the values of z ; O, 1, 2, 3, 8:0. And I integrated
them by the formula 12- (<U+FB01>rst ordinate + last ordinate) + sum of
intermediate ordinates -—T‘§ sum of second differences ; where it

  which is the true measure of the energy of the 22 cubic feet of
  water at the temperature which produces the pressure 60 lbs. to
  the square inch, in a hot iron boiler, the units of the energy
  being the metre and the kilogramme.
     15. If this be diminished in the ratio of 74-32 kilogs. (the
 <U+FB01>ctitious weight of water on which Professor Miller’s calcula
 tions are made) to 597'1 kilogs. (the real weight of water), then
 we shall have for the measure of the energy of the 22 cubic feet
 of water at the same temperature, unassisted by the hot iron of
 the boiler,
                                 909000 ;
 and if we divide the two numbers by 22, we have for the energy
 of one cubic foot of water at temperature producing a pressure
 of 60 lbs. to the square inch,
        As surrounded by hot iron, 51400. (This is the practical
              value.)
        Without in<U+FB02>uence from surrounding iron, 41300. (This
              is the philosophical value.)
     16. I now proceed with the evaluation of the energy of gun
 powder. The formula applicable to cannon-experiments is given
 In art. 4. Professor Miller referred me to a series of experiments
 by General Didion, in his Traité de Balistigue, p. 485. These ex
 periments were made with cannon of four different bores, and
 with eighteen different charges of powder in each cannon. The
 <U+FB01>rst thing to be done was, to <U+FB01>nd by trial for each cannon, by
means of the formula W'VQ
                                     (which for a single cannon may be

momentum produced bore the greatest proportion to the weight
of the powder. It wassfound to be the following :
       With ball of 12 kilogrammes, 1'500 kilog. of powder.
                ,,      s-01       ,,      1-250        ,,

                ,,      4-05      ,,       0-625         ,,
Then adopting these four for comparison among themselves, by
the formula Wéve
                      , it was found that the cannon in which the
powder was most e<U+FB01>icient was that with a ball of 6-08 kilogs.
Here it may be desirable to state that the bore was 0'1213 metre,
the diameter of the ball 0'1182 metre, the length of bore 2'815

 336       MM. H. Sainte-Claire Deville and Troost on the
 metres ; and, with the charge of powder 087?) kilog., the velocity
 of the issuing ball was 400 metres per second. Applying the
 formula H 19-623 >< w’ the energY of 1 kilo"5 ramme of 5‘111 P owder
 (as <U+FB01>red in a cannon) is found to be
                                56656,
 and that of an English pound of gunpowder
                                25700,
 the units being in all cases the metre and the kilogramme.
    17. Comparing this with the numbers found in art. 14, we
 have,                             -
    The destructive energy of 1 cubic foot of water at the tempe
       rature which produces the pressure 6O lbs. to the square
       inch, surrounded by hot iron, is precisely equal to the
       destructive energy of two pounds of gunpowder as <U+FB01>red in
       a cannon.
    18. The destructive energy of the hot water, however, abstract
 ing the effect of the surrounding hot iron, is considerably less
than the number used in this comparison ; and the destructive
energy of the gunpowder, abstracting the effects of windage, cold
iron, and short barrel, is considerably greater than the number
used for it. Without pretending to form an accurate estimate
of these effects, I think that their combination with that affect
ing the energy of the water may have diminished the apparent
proportion of the energy of gunpowder by one-half.             In that
case                                         -
   The destructive energy of 1 cubic foot of water at the tempe

      inch is equal to that of 1 pound of gunpowder.

       XLVIII. On the Measurement of Iligh Temperatures.
      By MM. H. SAINTE-CLAIRE DEVILLE and Tno0s'r*.
IN the experiments which chemists have constantly to make at
      very high temperatures, they are frequently stopped by the
dif<U+FB01>culty of <U+FB01>nding suitable vessels. Platinum vessels appear at
<U+FB01>rst sight perfectly suitable ; but we have always discarded them,
from the mistrust with which we are inclined to regard a metal
that is generally considered as having the property of condensing

  on its surface the gases with which it comes in contact. The
  perusal of M. Edmond Becquerel’s last paper has suggested the
  experiments which led us to the discovery of the real reason why
  platinum is not to be trusted when we wish to try experiments on
  gases or vapours at a high temperature.
     We take a platinum tube made from a well-worked ingot*,
 which is joined and drawn like a wire, so as to give a very
 sound, perfectly homogeneous tube, without any soldering. (The
 two tubes upon which we experimented were in this state, and
 had been made with the utmost care by MM. des Moutis, Cha
 puis and‘ Q,uennessen_.) This tube is introduced into another
 of Bayeux porcelain much wider and shorter, and the annular
 space between the two is closed by means of corks. This annular
 space is <U+FB01>lled with broken porcelain, and a current of dry pure
 hydrogen is sent through it, which, entering and issuing by two
 glass tubes, cannot have any direct communication with the
 inside of the platinum tube. This tube, which is closed by two
 india-rubber stoppers previously heated, receives air which has
 been dried by passing through an Alvergniat’s washing-bottle
 (laveur de M. Alvergniat), a glass _<U+FB01>lled with pumice moistened
 with sulphuric acid, and, lastly, a vesselwith pieces of fused pot
 ash. The apparatus thus prepared'|' is put into a furnace fed
 with air and carbon from gas-retorts. Thus in our apparatus
 the air and hydrogen circulate separated by a solid and con
 tinuous partition of platinum. On collecting the air which
leaves the platinum tube at the common temperature, it is found
to have the normal composition

At the ordinary temperature the hydrogen which issues from the
annular space is entirely absorbed by oxide of copper without
residue.
    But if the temperature is slightly raised, the e<U+FB01>'ect alters with
surprising regularity: the air gradually loses its oxygen, and
there condenses in the delivery-tube water which we have col
lected and weighed; its proportion keeps increasing with the
temperature. At last, when this has reached about 1lOO° (by
   ' We are only speaking here of common spongy platinum made coherent
by hammering in the way that it has always been prepared until lately. We
are now having a tube made of cast platinum, with which we shall repeat
our experiments.

that a tube of porous earthenware was then employed instead of the plati
num tube (see Comptes Rendus, vol. lii. p. 524).

estimate), the platinum tube into which dry air is sent yields
nothing but nitrogen and water* ; at the same time the number
of bubbles of hydrogen which issue from the tube leading from
the annular space is seen to diminishr. Moreover, when the
temperature of 1100° (by estimate) is exceeded, the gases leaving
the platinum tube contain an appreciable quantity of hydrogen.
    If the apparatus is allowed to cool, the same effects are repro
duced, but in the contrary order, the gas which traverses the
platinum tube returning to pure air.
    During the whole course of the experiments, the hydrogen
which leaves the annular space is entirely absorbed by oxide of
copper.

  denly close the cock which conducts the hydrogen into the an
  nular space, and immediately plunge the tube which lets out the
  gas into a mercury trough, the mercury is seen to rise gradually
  in this tube to a height of 602 millims. (the barometer being at
  753). The hydrogen is therefore till forcing its way into the
  platinum tube, and an almost complete vacuum is produced in
  the annular space. And yet we also ascertained that our appa
  ratus, di<U+FB02>icult as it was to construct, did not close perfectly.
  This is perhaps the only reason which can explain this slight
  difference of 15 centims. between the height of the barometer
 and the height of the mercury in the delivery-tube, a difference
 which measures the pressure of the gas remaining, or introduced
 by leaks in the porcelain tube.
     The result of the foregoing is, that platinum behaves at high
 temperatures like the porous vessels with which the beautiful
 experiments by M. Jamin on the diffusion of gases and those
  already published by one of us are obtained.
     A su<U+FB02>iciently convincing proof of this porosity may also be
 had by substituting, in the preceding experiment, pure and dry
 carbonic acid for air, and maintaining the current of hydrogen
 in the annular space. At the end of the platinum tube a great
 quantity of carbonic oxide and hydrogen may be collected at the
 same time as carbonic acid*.                              '
     These results show that it is impossible to construct gas-pyro

    The last analysis relates to the gas which issues from the platinum tube
and is collected at the highest temperature: the result establishes the pre
 sence of carbonic oxide and of moisture in the gases collected.
   1' M. Pouillet, in his experiments on the pyrometer which he <U+FB01>rst em
ployed, avoided to a great extent this source of error, as he heated his
apparatus in an iron muf<U+FB01>e very nearly closed. His temperatures are also
much higher than those of M. Ed. Becquerel, especially if M. Pouillet’s
results are modi<U+FB01>ed by adopting, as he himself recommends, the new coeffi
cient of expansion 15%; instead of Gay-Lussac’s coe<U+FB02>icient, with which they
were originally calculated (Traité de Physique, par M. Pouillet, 6"“ édit.
1853, t. 1“, pp. 237, 238, 239, 269, plate 9. <U+FB01>g. 8).        M. Ed. Becquerel
places the platinum reservoir of his pyrometer inside an earthenware tube
—that is to say, in a porous material through which the hydrogen of the
furnace can penetrate with the greatest ease.

340       MM. H. Sainte-Claire Deville and Troost on the
also easy to understand why the temperatures ascertained by
M. Ed. Becquerel, and which differ from those which we have
ourselves published, are lower by about 100° than all those
which have been obtained either by ourselves or by others.
   This porosity of the platinum perhaps prevents the gases from
being maintained at a high temperature and at a high pressure;
but the most important effect is that endosmose causes the gases
of the furnace to enter to the air of the pyrometer in spite of a
contrary pressure. Water is thus formed, and there is a dimi
nution of volume due to the disappearance of oxygen. It will
be hence understood why, in M. Ed. Becquerel’s experiments, it
was necessary to keep pieces of chloride of calcium constantly in
the pyrometer, and even to change them between the different
experiments (see p. 88 of his Mémoire).
   It is thus evident how the mass of gas, which in the platinum
pyrometer ought to remain the same (constant C), has, on the
contrary, varied from 238622 to 199164 in the series of expe
riments in which M. Ed. Becquerel appears to place most con
<U+FB01>dence. This variation of the constant attains the proportion of
l6'5 per cent. of its maximum value, which approaches the pro
portion of oxygen which the air contained at the beginning of
the experiment. M. Ed. Becquerel explains (page 90) this consi
derable variation, on the supposition that the mercury in his
manometer could combine in the cold with the oxygen of the air
contained in the apparatus. This hypothesis is inadmissible:
it would take away all precision from experiments made with lJlS
or similar apparatus; it would throw doubt upon all coe<U+FB02>icients
of expansion, &c. . . . . and in fact upon numbers which have
received every possible experimental con<U+FB01>rmation.
   The true explanation is plainly to be derived from our experi
ments; it is that, at a temperature not necessarily very high,
platinum becomes capable of producing the phenomena of endos
mose, and perhaps even of the losses by pressure which we <U+FB01>nd
in porous substances.                           -

 they hold a vacuum perfectly, and are still very far from their
 point of fusion or softening. These vessels, through which a
 current of dry air is sent until incipient red heat, are closed at
 the end of the experiment by an oxyhydrogen blowpipe, just as
 we close a glass air thermometer with a mouth-blowpipe. The
 only sources of error consist in the observation of barometric
 pressure, of the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, and
 lastly in the reading of the volume of the gases in a graduated
 tube. This latter being all that we have to consider, we should
 say that in working with <U+FB02>asks of 300 to 330 cubic centims.
 capacity, a very considerable and inadmissible error of half a
 cubic centim. would not sensibly affect our results. The tem
 peratures found by M. Ed. Becquerel would ascribe to us an
 error of about 10 cubic centims. upon 80, which is out of the
 question.

 the apparatus in which the metals are heated to ascertain their
 boiling-point. To arrive at a degree of exactitude which does
 not affect our vapour-densities, we are now repeating our mea
 surements of temperature by aid of the most delicate methods.
But as M. Ed. Becquerel seems to have placed himself very
 nearly in the same conditions as ourselves, it was needful to look
 elsewhere for the cause of our difference. It is this considera
 tion that led us to seek in platinum for a property unknown
 hitherto, though in perfect harmony with its catalytic action, and
 the feebleness of its conducting-power for heat and electricity*.
    * While this paper was printing, we received from Mr. Matthey, the
great London manufacturer, a cast platinum tube weighing 1070 grammes,
60 centims. long and about 2 millims. thick. All the experiments which we
have already described have been repeated with this tube, and gave exactly
the same result, causing the formation of water by means of hydrogen and
at the expense of the air, and producing a vacuum in the annular space, &c.
The immense thickness of this tube and its quality have in no respect
altered the phenomena, either in their direction, in their intensity, or in
their activity. Mr. Matthey, knowing what we were in need of, has had
this tube manufactured with part of the ingot of 100 kilogs. of cast plati
num which he exhibited in 1862, and, anticipating our wishes, has obligingly
sent it to us for the bene<U+FB01>t of science.  We publicly express our obliga

      around its centre; and the outer surface be a spheroid of equi

     PRATT.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
  IT has been asserted that all we know with any certainty
         regarding the constitution of the earth’s mass is contained
  in the following facts derived from observation and experiment:
  (1) That the level-surface obtained by geodesy, to which the
  plumbline is everywhere perpendicular, is almost exactly a sphe
 roid, of small ellipticity, about ,g,1,th, and coincides very nearly,
  if not exactly, with the mean surface of the earth. (2) That the
  force of gravity is nearly the same on all points of the surface,
  and changes, in passing from place to place, almost exactly as
  the change in the square of the sine of the latitude. (3) That
 the mean density is nearly equal to 566 times the density of
  water. It has been said that any notions we have of the inte
 rior arrangement of the mass are altogether theoretical. In
  connexion with this subject it has also been stated that nothing
 can be gathered from pendulum experiments (and therefore from
 the value of gravity and the ellipticity thence deduced) regarding
 the <U+FB02>uid arrangement of the earth’s mass. There appears to me
‘to have been some confusion of ideas on this subject. My pre
 sent object is to show that the <U+FB01>rst of the three facts I have
 enumerated above leads logically to the two following results :
     I. That the earth’s mass is, as a matter of fact, arranged in
 nearly spherical layers of equal density about the earth’s centre.
     II. That if we assume, as is generally done, that at least the
 mean exterior surface of the earth is a spheroid of equilibrium,
 then it follows as a necessary consequence that the forms of all
 the interior strata are also spheroids of equilibrium, and follow
 the <U+FB02>uid law, whether they are <U+FB02>uid or not now, or ever were so,
 in part or in whole.
     I. The earth's mass, as a matter offact, consists of nearly sphe
 rical sirata of equal density about the earth’s centre.
     2. Let r, 9, 10 be polar coordinates to any point on the earth’s
 surface, the centre being origin (cos 9: u); 1‘, 9', co’ coordinates to
 any point in the interior (cos 0'=;.i'), p' the density at that
 point; a the mean radius of the surface; r=a+a . u, u being a
 function of /4 and (0, and a a small fraction, because the surface
 is nearly spherical.    Then the potential of the whole mass for

    Now gravity is the attraction of the earth’s mass diminished
by the centrifugal force, which is always extremely small. Since,
then, gravity very nearly equals the attraction of the mass, and
its direction is very nearly towards the earth’s centre (being a
normal to the spheroid of equilibrium of small ellipticity), it
follows that

which are the attractions in the meridian and prime vertical at
right angles to r, must both be very small quantities. Hence

are both very small, and this whatever values p. and or have-—

some small function of ,u.' and co’ ; and r' +a . 1/ = constant will
be the general equation to the layers of equal density ; and these,
then, are all nearly spherical, because an . 1/ is small.
   II. If the exterior surface be a spheroid of equilibrium, the
layers are also spheroids of equilibrium, and follow the fluid law,
whether they are or have been <U+FB02>uid or not.
   3. If the surface is one of <U+FB02>uid equilibrium, then
       constant =V+ %wQ(1 — 9)r’=V+ gt 2, (1—,u.’)r’,

   By differentiating the value of V <U+FB01>rst given in paragraph 1, it
is not di<U+FB01>icult to show that

            ¢E{(1_"2)J;I +1-,.@;2.¢=-T?‘
Let V be expanded in a series of Laplace’s functions, and terms
of the ith order on the two sides equated. Then remember
ing that by Laplace’s equation the <U+FB01>rst side will be equal also to
-—i(i+ 1)V,, we have
                         d'*.rV
                       r   01,2 —i(i+l)V,-=0.
The solution of this is V,-=W,r"'+Z,-r", where W; and Z, are
independent of r.     The complete value of V becomes
          -V=YVT—" +%+Yv1§+...+Z.,+Z,r+Z,r’+...
    Now V must evidently equal zero when r is in<U+FB01>nitely great:
hence Z0=O, Z,=O, Z,=O, . . . Also the greater r is, the more
nearly equal are the distances of the attracted point from the
various points of the earth’s mass ; and ultimately as 1' is increased,
the potential must become E-1-r. Hence
    The <U+FB01>rst term of this is the value V would have if the earth’s
mass were arranged in exactly spherical shells. This is not
exactly the state of the earth, but is very nearly so, as I have
already shown. Hence W1, W5! . . . . are all small quantities.
    Let r= a(1+e(:_§— /1.9)) be the equation to the ellipse gene
rating the spheroid of equilibrium of the surface. Put this and
V in the equation of equilibrium at the beginning of this para

    From this formula is derived an expression for the value of
gravity, which

            = — E —cent. force, =—W —mg(l —p.’);
and therefore by pendulum experiments the value of e may be
 found.                                                                .
    This formula for V is not so general as it appears to be. It
 is true only for a certain arrangement of the mass E ; for it has
 been obtained upon the supposition that a part of the mass at
 the surface (it may be to a very small depth) was once <U+FB02>uid, or
 is arranged as if so now. Through this portion of the mass,
 then, the arrangement or law of density must be according to
the <U+FB02>uid law. From the manner in which E enters into the
above expression for V, viz. as the total mass, without any appa
 rent reference to the manner in which that mass is arranged, it
 may be thought by some that although the exterior part follows
 the <U+FB02>uid law, the other parts may follow any law, so long as the
 total mass is the same*. That this is an erroneous view I pro
 ceed to show. The equilibrium of a <U+FB02>uid in a vessel is unaffected
by the form or density of the material of the vessel, unless we
take into account the attraction of the parts of the vessel. This
is the case with the earth, the solid part of which may be regarded
as a vessel holding the portion which is <U+FB02>uid by hypothesis, and
altogether regulating its form by the attraction of its several
parts. If the whole were <U+FB02>uid, the equation of equilibrium with
which the calculation begins would appertain directly to the
   * It is the fact of my using the value of V above given in two papers in
the Philosophical Magazine for December 1862 and Supplement, giving
 Tests of the Fluid Theory, which has led to my writing the present paper.
As E enters into V without any apparent condition as to the distribution
of the mass, it might be thought that the changes of that distribution
which I suggested as tests ought not to have produced any effect on the
pendulum; which would be directly contrary to the results of my papers.

whole mass, and the arrangement of the mass E would obviously
be according to the <U+FB02>uid law throughout.       Suppose any part of
this to become solid, retaining this law of arrangement, the
equilibrium of the free <U+FB02>uid-surface would remain undisturbed.
Now consider the effect upon the free-<U+FB02>uid surface of any rear
rangement of this solid part within its own limits. The result
ant effect of this change in the arrangement of the attracting
matter upon the <U+FB02>uid-surface would be a force which might at
particular points of the surface equal zero, but which would in
general vary from point to point of the surface. The equili
brium of the <U+FB02>uid would therefore be disturbed by this change
of arrangement. It will be obvious from this, that no departure
of the arrangement of the attracting mass from that of the <U+FB02>uid
law, even in the solid parts of the mass, will allow the free sur
face to retain its form. Hence if the outer surface is one of
equilibrium all the strata are so too; and, as the <U+FB02>uid theory
shows, they are all spheroids of small ellipticity.
    The more nearly, therefore, geodesy and pendulum experi
ments bring out the mean form of the earth, represented by the
level surface, to be that of a spheroid, the more nearly spheroidal
are the strata. This is a logical consequence of the free surface
being held in equilibrium and having its form regulated by the
attraction of the whole mass. It does not prove how much or
how little of the mass is <U+FB02>uid, if, indeed, any part of it is; but
it shows that (if the surface is a spheroid of equilibrium) the
arrangement of the whole mass must be that peculiar one, and
no other, which coincides precisely with the <U+FB02>uid arrangement
in every part of the mass. If, then, the value of e obtained from
geodesy, when substituted in the formula for V, or rather in that
derived from it for gravity, makes it accord with the result of
pendulum experiments, we have a very strong evidence that the
super<U+FB01>cial parts of the earth’s mass have the equilibrium form,
and consequently that the whole mass throughout, solid or not,
is arranged according to the <U+FB02>uid law. No more convincing
argument, short of an absolute knowledge of the fact, could be
produced to show that the earth’s mass has derived its arrange
ment and form from having once been in a <U+FB02>uid condition—
especially as no other conceivable cause than rotation acting on
a <U+FB02>uid mass could have made the interior of the mass in every
stratum bulge out towards the equator, and in every part by the
precise quantity required by the <U+FB02>uid theory.

   L. On the Laws of the Expansion of the Transparent I/iquids by
        Increase of Temperature. By Professor POTTER, A.M.*
   IN my paper “ On the De<U+FB01>nition of the Temperature of Bodies,
         and on its Measurement by Thermometers,” published in
  this Magazine, vol. xxiv. p. 447, I showed that the expansion
  of mercury, as determined by the experiments of MM. Dulong
  and Petit, accorded very nearly to the law of uniform expan
  sion, or if V0 were the volume at any temperature, V the
  volume at t° above it, on a constant depending on the magnitude
  of the degrees on the thermometric scale employed, and e the
  base of the hyperbolic logarithms, then
                                V=V0 . e°“° ;
  and for the natural unit of temperature, taken to be the interval
  of sensible heat between the freezing- and boiling-points of water
  under ordinary circumstances, the value of 0% was
                             a='0178576.
     The determinations of M. Regnault for the expansion of
 mercury are found to be also according to the law of uniform
 expansion very accurately, but with the value of at as follows :—
                             at = 'O17'9901.
     The differences between the calculated quantities and those
 given by M. Regnault for a volume unity at the freezing--point
 of water commence only at the fourth place of decimals. With
 our thermometric scales still unsettled, it is useless to expect
 greater accordance.
    On examining the valuable results of M. Ch. Drion and M.
 J. Is. Pierre, given in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique,
 on the expansion of many transparent liquids by increase of
temperature, it will be found that few, if any of them, are sub
ject to the law of uniform expansion.
    When many years ago I was engaged in experiments on
 photometry, I found that the quantity of light re<U+FB02>ected out of a
given incident pencil of rays, at the surfaces of crown, plate,
and <U+FB02>int glass, was a hyperbolic function of the angle of inci
dence. The results were <U+FB01>rst published in vol. iv. (for 1831) of
Brewster's ‘Edinburgh Journal of Science’; and the formulae,
with the values of the constants for the three kinds of glass
used, are also published in my .‘ Treatise on Physical Optics,’
vol. ii., “ On the Corpuscular Theory of Light,” p. 36.

of hydrochloric ether at temperatures from 0° C. to 133° C.,
approaching its point of entire vaporization, were very far from

 following a law of uniform expansion, not being nearly repre
 sented by the formula V=V0 . e°“°, I remembered my investiga
 tions in photometry, and resolved to apply a hyperbolic formula
 to M. Drion’s'results. I have found that the volumes at dif
 ferent temperatures are as nearly represented by a hyperbolic
 function of the temperature as can be expected, since the volumes
  are the apparent ones shown by an instrument in the form of a
 thermometer, and uncorrected for the amount of vapour in the
  stem and the compressibility of the liquid under its pressure,
 from want of the requisite
  data.

   a, b, ca, .z', ywe must have
i the constants a, b, c2 given
  in order that the curve may be known.
      Now in the expansion of hydrochloric ether, if O M=a:repre
   sents the temperature, and PM=y the corresponding volume
   of the liquid, then the three quantities a, b, ca can be calculated
   from three sets of corresponding volumes and temperatures.
   Having found the values of the constants in this manner, the
   value of y for any other given value of .z' can be calculated by the
   equation of the curve :

   volume is taken unity at the freezing temperature of 0° C., always
   for one of our three equations, and one of the others near the
   middle, with the remaining one near the extreme of the series of
   observations, the values of a, b, 02 were found; and then the for
   mula being applied to the remaining observed temperatures, and
   the volumes calculated, they were found to show only small dif
   ferences from the observed results in every part of the series.

                               0’ =117'7508.
   Further research might have yielded values giving results in
the calculation of the volumes nearer, on the whole, to the
observed volumes than these do; but it appeared unnecessary,
since it is admitted that the apparent volumes need small but
unascertained corrections, and some small allowance is needed
for unavoidable error of experiment.

   The differences at the utmost are only small numbers, com
mencing in the third place of decimals; and I think we are
entitled to conclude that hydrochloric ether, one of the very
expansible liquids, has its volume a hyperbolic function of the
temperature, and the general physical properties are connected
by three constant magnitudes.
   M. Drion shows that the expansion is equal to that of air
at about the temperature 110° C. ; at 130° C. it is nearly 3%,; times
as expansible as at the freezing-point, and it becomes entirely
vapour at about 170° C.
   In M. Drion’s experiments with the liquid nitrous acid (acide
hg/pazotique), they could be carried only from 0° C. to about
 90 C., on account of the termination of the liquid in the stem

 between the observed and calculated volumes disappear at these

 the third place of decimals. Values of a, b, and 02 might have
 been found by further investigation which would have left smaller
 differences upon the whole, but it did not seem necessary to
 examine further.

     M. Drion found the coe<U+FB02>icient of expansion of liquid sulphurous
  acid to equal that of air at the temperature of about 80° C., and
 at 130° C. it is nearly triple that of air, and the liquid is <U+FB01>ve
 times as dilatable as at the freezing temperature. It becomes
  entirely -vapour at about 140° C.
     The values of a, b, c’ below for liquid sulphurous acid were
 obtained by taking the average of different determinations, and
 they give results which still leave the differences as seen by the
 Table annexed, commencing in the third place of decimals with

 considering the corrections needed, is still sul<U+FB01>cient, through so

     M. J. Is. Pierre investigated, in most valuable experiments,
 the expansions of forty-four transparent liquids, at temperatures
 below their boiling-points under atmospheric pressure. He con
 cluded that they follow very different and complicated laws of
 expansion. I believe it will be found generally (water being the
 only known exception) that the transparent liquids follow the
 same law of hyperbolic expansion, but that the three constants
 a, b, and 02 have very different value for different liquids.
    Aldehyde being the most expansible of the liquids which he
 tried, and, as he concluded, the most expansible of all liquids
 then known after the liquid carbonic acid, I examined <U+FB01>rst the
degree of its accordance with the hyperbolic law.
    The circumstances of M. Pierre’s experiments are a little dif
ferent from those of M. Drion, the liquid being under atmo
spheric pressure at its free upper surface in his instrument in
the form of a thermometer; whilst the experiments of M. Drion
were made with a closed instrument of like form, and the liquid
was thus subject to the variable pressure due to the elastic force
of its vapour only at its surface. The compressibility of liquids,
according to Canton’s law, is so very small that the correction of the
volumes on this account for even high pressures will be very small.
    The values of the constants a, b, c’ for aldehyde were deter
mined from M. Pierre’s results at the temperatures —20°'69 C.,
 +12°'07 C., and +21°'32 C., the liquid boiling at 22° C., and
its speci<U+FB01>c gravity being '80551.
   The values, as follows,
                           a =            6688698,
                           b = 2615555,
                           c2 = 1128826,
differ only in a moderate degree from the like values for hydro
chloric ether, but very considerably from those for nitrous acid.

   After examining the conformity of aldehyde to the law of
hyperbolic expansion, I have undertaken a few others of the
best-known liquids. The computations, otherwise somewhat
laborious, have in these cases been comparatively easy, since, the
constants a, b, c2 having been determined from the <U+FB01>rst three
conditions taken up, the remainder of the experimental results
were found to give differences from the calculated values com
mencing at the most in the fourth place of decimals, and gene

    The differences between the observed and calculated values are
 small, commencing when largest with small numbers in the
 fourth place of decimals; and we must conclude that oil of tur
 pertine is subject to the law of hyperbolic expansion.
    In the geometrical representation of our problem we have
 employed the equation (_1/—a)(h—w)=c9, and it must be homo
 geneous ; that is, 3/ representing a volume of the liquid, a repre
 sents a volume also ; and .2 representing degrees of temperature,
 h represents degrees of temperature also. The quantity cQ con
 sequently represents a product of a volume and a temperature.
 For convenience, putting c’ for the volume, and c" for the tem
perature, and 02:0’. 0'', we have
                                                         ,1:

In this expression it is evident that we may change the unit of
volume without altering the units or degrees of temperature, and
the converse, and the equation will remain homogeneous. As,
for instance, we might, with M. Pierre, take the volume of the
liquid at its boiling-point for the unit of volume, and leave the
degrees of temperature those of the Centigrade scale.
    On the other hand, we may leave the unit of volume that of
the liquid at the freezing-point of water, and change the unit of
temperature to that of the natural scale with the freezing-point
zero, and the interval from freezing to boiling of water unity

LI. Some results of Experiments instituted with Lucifer Matches
      and others ignited by friction.   By F. A. ABEL, F.R.S.*
TWO distinct experimental inquiries, upon which I have
         recently been engaged, involved the chemical examination
of a considerable number of matches of different kinds, manu
factured in London, the Provinces, Germany, and Sweden; and
included determinations of the comparative susceptibility to igni
tion by friction or percussion, and by heat, and of other points
bearing reference to the safety and keeping qualities of the
matches of di<U+FB02>erent manufacture. Believing that the informa
tion furnished by the results of these experiments may be of some
general use and interest, I venture to lay a brief account of them
before the Members of the British Association.
   * Communicated by the Author, having been read at the British Asso
ciation at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in August 1863.

356        Mr. F. A. Abel on some results ofExperiments
             Composition of Matches of dzferent classes.
   Thirty-<U+FB01>ve different kinds of matches were examined and ex
perimented with; these included, besides ordinary lucifer or
Congreve matches, varieties of wax or Vesta matches, of cigar
lights (Fusees,Vesuvians, &c.), and of so-called “safety matches.”
    The following points were noted with reference to the nature
of the Congreve and Vesta matches.
    I. The in<U+FB02>ammable coating applied to the wooden matches
(beneath the igniting composition) was sulphur, with very few
exceptions. In two instances the tips had been soaked in or
coated with fatty matter (apparently stearic acid) ; in two others,
para<U+FB01>in was employed as the in<U+FB02>ammable coating; and the ends
of the round Austrian matches (Pollak and Hermann and Gabriel)
 were found to have a coating of resin applied over the igniting
composition and on the match some little distance beyond-—thus
 serving the double purpose of protecting the composition from
 the effects of moisture, and rendering the wood in proximity to
the former more in<U+FB02>ammable. In a variety of Congreve match of
 French manufacture, the sulphur coating is similarly applied over
 the composition, and a perfectly waterproof, though somewhat
 di<U+FB01>cultly ignitable match is thus produced.
     II. The igniting compositions of the Congreve and Vesta
 matches present considerable variations in their characters. The
 following are the principal points noted in their analytical ex
 amination.                                                    '
     Those of all the matches of English manufacture examined
 were found to contain chlorate of potassa. It appears, indeed,
 that the employment of this salt in place of nitrate of potassa
 has become universal in England. On the other hand, not one
 description of the foreign matches examined was found to be pre
 pared with chlorate of potassa. Some German matches of infe
 rior make contained nitrate of potassa ; but the majority of German
 and all the Swedish matches examined contained nitrate of lead
 as the oxidizing agent, mixed with ordinary phosphorus, alone or
 in addition to red lead, litharge, or Vermilion. One description
 of German match contained binoxide of lead with nitrate of lead,
  the two having probably been prepared as a mixture by the action
  of nitric acid upon red lead.
     By far the larger proportion of matches are still prepared with
  ordinary phosphorus ; sulphide of antimony and powdered glass
  are very general additional constituents of the igniting composi
  tion. The following statements show the principal variations in
  the nature of the igniting materials prepared with ordinary
  phosphorus :—

                                              litharge.
     The matches of several extensive English manufacturers were
 found to be prepared with an igniting composition containing
 both ordinary and amorphous phosphorus, the latter being em
 ployed in some instances in considerable quantity, and bearing
 in others only a very small proportion to the ordinary phosphorus
 contained in the mixture. Golden sulphide of antimony and
 powdered glass were found in all the igniting compositions of this
 class, and a small proportion of free sulphur was contained in
 several of them.                                                            -
     III. The Congreve and Vesta matches of English manufactur
 which are tipped with compositions containing no phosphorus
 whatever, are unquestionably great improvements upon the earlier
 continental matches of this class. They are in<U+FB02>amed with ease
 and certainty when pressed over the amorphous phosphorus rubber
  on the box ; and the latter does not rapidly deteriorate from the
 effects of atmospheric moisture upon it, as was formerly the case.
  I have found these matches as readily ignitable by the phos
  phorus rubber after the latter had been kept in a moist atmo
 sphere for several months, as they were when freshly purchased *.
     * The very perfect manner in which mixtures containing amorphous
  phosphorus are protected from the effects of moisture under the most severe
  conditions, by means of shell-lac, has been exem li<U+FB01>ed most strikingly in the
  case of the so-called “ detonators ” in the fuses or ordnance, constructed by
  SirWilliam Armstrong. A proportion of powdered shell-lac is added to the

  358       Mr. F. A. Abel on some results of Experiments
     The compositions with which these matches are tipped consist
  mainly of chlorate of potassa, sulphide of antimony and glass,
  red lead and binoxide of manganese being additional constituents.
  The amorphous phosphorus, mixed with a small quantity of glass
 powder, is attached to the surface of the box by means of gum.
     IV. In the preparation of the older variety of cigar lights,
  known as fusees, nitrate of potassa appears to be extensively
  employed. The brown paper composing the match is impreg
 nated with saltpetre (some were found to contain, besides, a con
 siderable proportion of chloride of sodium, which may have
 existed in the crude saltpetre employed, or have been added on
 account of its ready fusibility, whereby the ash of the match is
 rendered <U+FB01>rmer, and less liable, therefore, to fall away while glow
 ing). The igniting composition with which these matches are
 tipped consists of nitrate of potassa, ordinary phosphorus, and a
 small quantity of vermilion.
     V. The other class of cigar lights (known as Vesuvians, Etnas,
 Stars, &c.) consist, as is well known, of three parts——the support
 or handle (of wood or glass), the ball or thick coating which con
 stitutes the body of the match, and the igniting composition
 with which this is tipped.          The latter resembles the composi
 tions which are applied to the ordinary Congreve or Vesta
 matches; the bodies of these cigar lights vary somewhat in
 composition ; they generally consist of chlorate of potassa, coal
 or coke-dust, some binding material, and in some instances an
 admixture of clay or brickdust, and of an aromatic substance.
   lMemoranda relating to the in<U+FB02>uence of Heat and of Friction or
                          Percussion upon Matches.
    It need scarcely be observed that great differences exist between
the temperatures at which the igniting material of different
 matches will in<U+FB02>ame spontaneously, and in the degree of facility
with which they are ignited by friction and percussion.
    The degree of sensitiveness of a match to ignition by heat only
was determined by its exposure to gradually ascending tempera
tures, both in an air-bath and in a very con<U+FB01>ned space surrounded
by heated water; and also by rapidly plunging the tip of the
match into, and again withdrawing it from, heated mercury. For
reasons which will be evident from some of the following state
materials composing the igniting or detonating composition employed in
these fuses, and their mixture is effected by the aid of su<U+FB02>icient alcohol to
convert the mass into a paste. The material thus obtained, and protected
additionally (after it has been placed in its receptacle) by a coating of shell
lac varnish, resists effectually the most searching and protracted exposure
to moisture, even at elevated temperatures.

instiluted with Lucifer Matches and others ignited byfriction. 359
ments, the latter method generally furnished the most trust
worthy results.
   By far the greater number of matches experimented with did
not in<U+FB02>ame at temperatures ranging up to, and somewhat ex
ceeding, that of boiling water. Some few, which contained a
large proportion of ordinary phosphorus in their igniting com
position, in<U+FB02>amed at temperatures ranging between 77° and
100° C. Three or four different kinds in<U+FB02>amed after some time
when surrounded by boiling water, though a considerably higher
temperature was required for their ignition by contact with heated
mercury or in an air-bath. This difference was traced to the
slight but continuous concussions to which the head of the match
was subject in consequence of the ebullition of the water. Some
other matches (the cylindrical kinds from Austria), the tips of
which were coated with varnish, only in<U+FB02>amed after a time when
surrounded by boiling water, and required a temperature of
102° C. for their ignition by immersion into mercury. Upon
partially removing the thin coating of varnish from the tips of
these matches, they were in<U+FB02>amed at once at 96° C.         Many of
the matches tried did not in<U+FB02>ame spontaneously below 115° C. ;
two or three varieties of common lucifers required a temperature
of 138° C. for their ignition; and one description, containing a
comparatively small proportion of ordinary phosphorus, did not
in<U+FB02>ame below 160° C.
   In exposing the matches separately or in numbers (i. e. a box
full) to gradually increasing temperatures in an air-bath, it was
observed that the sensitiveness to ignition by heat alone (and by
friction also) diminished in proportion to the period of exposure
of the match to elevated temperatures. Thus, it was repeatedly
found that a match was almost directly ignited on its introduc
tion into a heated atmosphere in which matches of the same
kind had been for some time exposed without any such result,
they having been gradually raised, together with the air, to the
particular temperature. The extent to which the sensitiveness
of a match could be reduced by long exposure to heated air was
remarkable, though it is a result which must be expected to arise
from the promotion, by heat, of the gradual volatilization and
oxidation of the phosphorus in the igniting material.
   The order of sensitiveness to ignition by friction or percussion
of a match was found to correspond with its susceptibility to
ignition by heat alone, in the case of those which contained ordi
nary phosphorus and chlorate of potasa, provided that glass was
included in the composition of the igniting material. Where
this was not the case, the matches, though they might be more
sensitive to the effects of heat alone than others, on account of
the predominance of phosphorus in them, were considerably less

360       Mr. F. A. Abel on some results ofE.1.y2eriments
so to the e<U+FB02>fects of friction or percussion. The only Congreve
match examined which was prepared with nitrate of potassa and
phosphorus (and contained an admixture of glass), though mo
derately sensitive to the effects of heat, ranked lowest as regarded
its sensitiveness to ignition by friction or percussion; and the
same observation applies to all the matches which contained
nitrate of lead in the place of chlorate of potassa.
   Observations relating to the possible sources ofaccident in the
                       transport of Matches.
   The results of experimental observations, of which the prin
cipal points have been noted in the foregoing, prove conclusively
that no degree of heat to which, under all ordinary circum
stances, matches are likely to be exposed in their transport or
otherwise, would suf<U+FB01>ce to lead to their spontaneous ignition.
Even a temperature such as, for example, can be attained only
under exceptional conditions by the atmosphere in the hold of a
vessel, would not, unaided, bring about the ignition of the more
sensitive matches.
   The effect, however, of even a very moderate degree of heat in
facilitating the ignition, by friction or percussion, of mixtures
such as those with which the tips of the matches a1-e prepared,
is well known, and admits of easy demonstration. It may be
readily shown by means of matches themselves. - If a box full
of lucifer matches (e. g. one of the more carefully made and
pretty tightly closing slide boxes), in which the matches, as is
very generally the case, are not suf<U+FB01>ciently long to <U+FB01>ll the box.
entirely, be subject to repeated concussion, in such a way that
the heads of the matches strike repeatedly with some violence
against one end of the box, a proportion of the matches will
eventually in<U+FB02>ame (the number ignited and the rapidity of the
ignition being regulated by the sensitiveness of the match) ; but
the composition upon the head of the match alone burns, and
the <U+FB02>ame generally does not even spread from the head of the
match ignited to those immediately surrounding it; so that only
isolated matches will be in<U+FB02>amed in a box full with all the heads
placed in one direction. If, however, a box of the same matches
be exposed to a heated atmosphere (from 27° to 37° C.) su<U+FB02>ici
ently long for the matches to become warm throughout, the
extent to which it will be necessary to submit them to concus
sion before ignition occurs will be comparatively very slight,
and in all probability the whole of the matches in the box will
become in<U+FB02>amed almost simultaneously. In common match
boxes, with which this experiment has been tried, and which did
not close at all tightly, the wood of the matches was partially

      It appears, therefore, at least within the range of possibility
  that in the transport of matches on board ship, and in the
  absence of due precautionary measures, continuous concussion,
  combined with a degree of heat not unfrequent in the hold of a
  vessel, maybring about the accidental ignition of lucifer matches-—‘
  an occurrence which is known to have taken place, and which,
  it is believed, is much more frequently the cause of <U+FB01>res on
  board ships than manufacturers and exporters of matches may be
  disposed to admit. While it may be granted that the accidental
  ignition of one or two boxes in a securely closed case of matches
  may frequently occur, especially under ordinary atmospheric
  conditions, almost without the possibility of the <U+FB01>re spreading
  even to other boxes in the same case, yet a knowledge of the
  very remote causes to which the accidental ignition of gunpowder
  and other explosions have been traced, and of the impossibility
  of securing infallibility in extensive manufactories-—with regard
  to such a point as, for example, the air-tight closing of cases
  containing lucifer matches intended for shipment—renders it, to
   say the least, advisable that such precautionary measures as are
   obvious and easily observed should be attended to in the ship
   ment of matches, with the view to reduce to the minimum the
   possibility of their accidental ignition.
      Among such measures would be included
       (1) The special appropriation, if possible, of some part of the
   vessel in which matches are transported, to the reception of the
   packages containing them-or, at any rate, the stowage of such
- packages together (as far as practicable), distinct from other
   merchandise of a combustible nature, and in such positions that
   they may be readily removed in the event of any accidental igni
   tion occurring;
       (2) The e<U+FB01>icient ventilation of that part of a vessel in which
   matches are stowed;
       (3) The enforcement of rules on board ship to prevent the
   possibility of <U+FB01>re being brought by sailors or others into the
   vicinity of packages of matches; .
       (4) The careful packing of match-boxes into cases, so as to
   prevent their being subjected to any independent motion by the
   movement of the vessel; and
       (5) The bestowal of a more uniform attention upon the pro
   duction of safe and sufficiently stable match-boxes. It need
   hardly be observed that a very great variation exists in the form
   and quality of the match-boxes used in this country and abroad.
   The metal boxes with hinge lids, in which Vesta matches are
   most generally packed, rank highest as regards the security they
   afford to the match; and the circumstance that no accident,
   however slight, is on record as having attended the shipment of

 ‘Vesta matches, may stand in close connexion with the employ
 ment of such boxes with these particular matches. There are
  several other kinds of boxes much used by manufacturers (e. g.
 the cylindrical boxes of wood or cardboard with tightly <U+FB01>tting
 lids, and the superior kinds of slide boxes made of cardboard or
 well-covered chip) which are calculated to afford security to the
 matches, or rather which would do so if their length (or height)
 were properly proportioned to the length of the matches. In the
 majority of instances, however, they are longer or higher than
 the matches, and sometimes very considerably so; hence if the
 latter are not most <U+FB01>rmly wedged into the boxes, the construc
 tion of these is positively calculated to afford opportunity for
 submission of the match-heads to concussion. The slide-boxes
 containing the Swedish matches, which are now largely imported,
 are all made to correspond in length with the matches they con
 tain. A very extensive importer of these matches states that he
 has never known of a single instance of accidental ignition occur
ring in their transport.
    Many of the boxes roughly constructed of thin chip, partly
 held together by paper coverings, which contain the commoner
 descriptions of English congreves, not only afford but little pro
 tection to their contents, but may actually be in many instances
 sources of danger, in consequence of their imperfect construc
tion, their very fragile nature, and their ready in<U+FB02>ammability.
 Unless boxes of this kind are packed with the greatest possible
care (whether slide boxes, or boxes with lids secured by a paper
hinge), some proportion is almost certain to sustain injury
resulting in the immediate escape of matches from the box.’
 Indeed many of these boxes in theiroriginal state readily allow
of the escape of matches, if simply tilted ; or at any rate the tips
of the matches partially protrude from the box and become <U+FB01>xed
in that position. In either case, some matches will thus be
exposed to very greatly increased risk of ignition by friction or
percussion; and if a match is <U+FB01>red in a package consisting of
boxes such as those now referred to, the risk of the <U+FB01>re extend
ing must be comparatively considerable.
    The degree of security with which the frictional material (sand,
glass-, or emery-powder) is attached to the match-boxes, is also
subject to great variation. In some instances a piece of well
made glass- or emery-paper is pasted on to the bottom of the
box, or some <U+FB01>ne emery- or glass-powder is securely <U+FB01>xed to
one of its surfaces by means of glue and coatings of varnish ;
but in many instances either glass- or emery-paper of very infe
rior quality is used, or the frictional powder is very loosely and
carelessly attached to the box by being merely dusted over one
of its surfaces, upon which a small quantity of glue has <U+FB01>rst been

            M. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Oxides.         363
   applied.    In suchiinstances the fragments of glass, emery, or
   sand are so loosely attached that a great proportion may be
   removed by passing the <U+FB01>nger lightly over them. It is evident
   that, in packing match-boxes of this kind, much of the frictional
   powder will become detached, and further quantities will speedily
   be rubbed off and be loose in the cases if the slightest play for
   movement of the boxes during transport exists in the packages.
  The hard angular particles thus liberated will speedily insinuate
  themselves into the boxes and between the matches; and it is
  self-evident that they may then contribute their share towards
   augmenting the possibility of accident.
      It is almost needless to mention that the foregoing remarks
   do not in any way refer to the matches spoken of in the begin
   ning of this communication, which are ignited only by being
   passed over a surface of their box which is coated with a prepa
   ration of amorphous phosphorus. The compositions with which
  the matches of this class are tipped require very powerful fric
   tion or percussion for their ignition, and are of course in<U+FB02>amed
   at temperatures far above that required to ignite the least sensi
  tive of the matches prepared with phosphorus. The possibility
   of their accidental ignition must therefore be, to say the least,
  extremely remote.
      In conclusion, it may be asserted with little hesitation, that no
  di<U+FB02>"erence of opinion is likely to exist regarding the compara
  tively very greafrisk which must be incurred in the transport of
  the new varieties of cigar lights, and,,indeed, the impossibility of
_ adopting precautionary measures which can warrant their ship
  ment with any con<U+FB01>dence in the safety of the vessel. _
      LII. On a new Series of Metallic Oxides.     By H. Ros1s*.
  BERZELIUS determined, by numerous and variously mo
           di<U+FB01>ed experiments, the atomic weights of the simple sub
  stances, paying especial regard to the analogous properties of
  their oxides, in which he evinced wonderful circumspection and
  a <U+FB01>ne tact. With the greatest care he took into consideration all
  circumstances ; so that his assumptions, with few exceptions,
  could be recognized as being correct, even when, after the dis
  covery of two very important laws, it was possible to determine
  the atomic weights of the simple bodies with greater certainty
  than before. One of these laws is that discovered by Dulong
  and Petit, that the speci<U+FB01>c heats of the simple bodies are in
  versely as their atomic weights. This law has been especially

con<U+FB01>rmed by a long series of experiments by Regnault, by which
he showed that the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the same substance may
be clitferent according as it is taken in the solid, the liquid, or
in the gaseous c0ndition—but that with simple bodies in the
solid form, which are otherwise in the same physical condi
tion, the product of the speci<U+FB01>c heat into the atomic weight
varies between the numbers 38 and 41 (if the atomic weight is
taken at 100), and that these variations depend less on errors
in the experiments than on the fact that the speci<U+FB01>c heat of
bodies, as determined by experiment, contains foreign elements
which hitherto could not be eliminated—and that, further,
simple bodies in their various allotropic forms have a somewhat
different speci<U+FB01>c heat.
    Dulong and Petit found that the atomic weights of the then
known metals of easy preparation, and of sulphur, were the same
as those which Berzelius had found, with the exception of sil
ver. In the case of this metal, they found that the product of
the speci<U+FB01>c heat into the atomic weight, as assumed by Berze
lius, only agrees with the numbers which the other simple bodies
 give when the atomic weight is divided by 2,—a fact which
Regnault’s experiments also con<U+FB01>rmed.
    The second law which serves to determine the atomic weights
of simple bodies is that of isomorphism, discovered by Mitscher
lich. According to this, compounds of the same atomic compo
sition may, when they can be crystallized, assun<U+FB01> the same forms.
That, exceptionally, there may be bodies of the same crystalline
form whose atomic composition could not hitherto be connected,
does not disprove the accuracy of this law. But both isomor
phism, and the law of the connexion between the speci<U+FB01>c heat
and atomic weight of bodies, led to the conclusion that the atomic
weight assumed by Berzelius for silver must be diminished by
one-half.
    .In an investigation of the crystallized compounds of antimony
and arsenic occurring in nature, I had found that the composi
tion of the crystallized Fahlerz and Polybasite, which latter have
 a simpler composition than the former, can only be explained by
 assigning to sulphide of silver an analogous composition to sul
 phide of copper, Cu2 S. Numerous analyses of these two mine
 rals gave the result that in them sulphide of silver and sulphide
 of copper can replace one another in the most varied proportions*.
 But the isomorphism of sulphide of silver and of sulphide of
 copper, Cu9 S, is still further con<U+FB01>rmed by the composition of
 crystallized argentiferous sulphuret of copper (Silber/cupferglanz),
 which consists of sulphide of silver and sulphide of copper, Cu’ S,

and has the same form as the native vitreous copper (Kupferglanz),
Cu2S*.
   Although it indubitably follows from these facts and nume
rous others that the atomic weight assumed by Berzelius for
silver must be changed, this change has scarcely been accepted
by any chemist. Almost all assume, as hitherto, that oxide of
silver consists of an atom of metal and an atom of oxygen, and
consider that in composition it is analogous to oxide of copper
and oxide of lead, and not to suboxide of copper and suboxide
of mercury.
   Yet, on the other hand, it cannot be denied that there are
also weighty reasons for the retention of the universally adopted
atomic weight of silver. The chief reason against halving the
atomic weight of this metal is doubtless the fact that some com
pounds of silver would acquire an altogether unusual composi
tion. For if we assume that in oxide of silver 2 atoms of the
metal are combined with 1 atom of oxygen, suboxide of silver
will contain no less than 4iatoms of metal for 1 atom of oxygen.
This composition appears so entirely unusual, that the numerous
reasons which speak for changing the atomic weight of silver
have been disregarded, and the old assumption has been retained.
   When such an unusual composition is assigned to a compound
as the suboxide of silver, assuming that it consists of 4 atoms of
metal for 1 of oxygen, this assumption will always be doubted
until analogous compounds have been discovered whose compo
sition can be explained in no other way.
  Hence I have taken much trouble to prepare oxides of the same
composition as suboxide of silver, and after many fruitless expe
riments I have been successful. I have succeeded in obtaining
an oxide of copper which contains twice as much oxygen as sub
oxide of copper, and hence is analogous to suboxide of silver. I
have hitherto not succeeded in preparing a similar oxide in the
case of mercury, but I hope to do so. I shall further show that
the number of such oxides is by no means small, but that their
preparation will be attended with great di<U+FB01>culties.
                           Nomenclature.
   Before I proceed to describe the preparation and properties of
the new copper compound, it is necessary to assign a name to
this class of oxides,whose chief representative is suboxide of silver.
   Chemical nomenclature, more especially the German, is very
imperfect. The most imperfect, however, is the designation of
the different metallic oxides; it is not only inconvenient, but
may give rise to much confusion. Originally we only had names
for two oxides; and when several were discovered, help was

366         M. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Oxides.
 sought in various ways, but seldom according to right principles.
 The French and the English nomenclature have this advantage
over ‘the German, that the several degrees of oxidation of a metal
 can be designated much more readily. But all have the defect,
 that the oxides of the same name do not always belong to one
 and the same group, the members of which with the same atomic
 composition have similar properties. Thus, as regards their
 atomic composition, protoxide of iron, protoxide of tin, with oxide
 of copper and oxide of zinc, belong to the same group, while
 they differ in their nomenclature; and while oxide of iron and
oxide of lead have similar designations, they have different com
position and properties. This has frequently unpleasantly sur
prised the chemist, and a remedy for it has on many occasions
been sought. Thus oxide of nickel and oxide of cobalt are now
often called protoxide of nickel and protoxide of cobalt, to bring
them into the same category with protoxide of iron and protoxide
of manganese, to which, indeed, oxide of zinc and oxide of copper
belong. But as many chemists, for good reasons, have not
adopted this innovation, an unavoidable confusion arises from
these various designations.
    This great defect may be obviated by taking the atomic com
position as basis for the designation of the various metallic oxides.
Similar compositions correspond to similar properties, and in this
way natural groups are formed. In this respect I take upon
myself to make proposals. The names which I propose seem to
avoid all the disadvantages of the previous ones, and at the same
time suit all languages.
    In atomic relations we can distinguish <U+FB01>ve distinct classes of
sali<U+FB01>able oxides, of the following composition :—
          (l)   4 atoms of metal with 1 atom of oxygen.
                2    n           :1      1      n      n
         (3)    1 atom           ,,      1      ,,     ,,
          (4)   2 atoms          ,,      3   atoms     ,,
          (5)   1 atom           ,,      2     ,,      ,,
    The last division of oxides can scarcely be considered as belong
ing to the sali<U+FB01>able ones.
    If now the oxides of the different divisions are named accord
ing to the number of oxygen atoms which are combined with
an atom of metal, they may have the following names :—
                  (1) M+ $0, Quadrantoxide.
                  (2) M + £8, ISemi(c1)xide.
                  (3) M +           ,  soxi e.
                  (4) M + 150, Sesquioxide.
                  (5) M + 20, Diploxide *.
   "* The oxides of the composition R3 O‘ are usually and justly regarded

    The corresponding compounds of the metals with chlorine,
bromine, iodine, cyanogen, and sulphur may be named in a
similar manner.
    I have used this nomenclature in what follows.
                          Quadrantowide of Copper.
    If a solution of blue vitriol is treated with isochloride of tin
(protochloride of tin) to which some hydrochloric acid has been
added, semichloride (protochloride) of copper is obtained. If
the semichloride thus obtained is brought while still moist into
a dilute solution of isochloride of tin in hydrate of potash, the
white chloride is changed into a greenish body, which, however,
is reduced to metallic copper if a less dilute alkaline solution be
employed, and in excess
    If a solution of blue vitriol be added to an excess of the very
 dilute alkaline tin       olution, at <U+FB01>rst blue hydrated semioxide of
copper is precipitated; but this rapidly assumes a yellow colour
 and changes into semioxide of copper. The yellow colour of the
 precipitate changes also on agitation, and passes into an olive
 green colour. The precipitate, which at <U+FB01>rst was very volumi
 nous, now begins to become dense and to assume a brownish-red
 colour. It now rapidly settles on being shaken, and consists of
 metallic copper, which, moistened with hydrochloric acid or with
 ammonia, remains almost unchanged. But on agitation, after
 the separation of metallic copper, the liquid does not become
 clear rapidly, but the part of the green body which is not yet
 reduced to oxide remains long suspended. It <U+FB01>nally sinks also,
 and undergoes the reduction to metallic copper;
     The green body thus obtained has an extraordinary tendency
 to become more highly oxidized. Even with a very slight access
 of air, it oxidizes on the surface under water into yellow semioxide
 of copper (suboxide of copper), and <U+FB01>nally changes into dirty
 bluish isoxide of copper.
  ' By its extremely ready oxidizability on the one hand, and, on
 the other, by its easy reductibility to metallic copper by even a
 small excess of the dilute solution of tin, the preparation of the
 as saline compounds of an isoxide and a sesquioxide.       In their solutions,
 the sesquioxide is precipitated by weak bases, such as carbonate of baryta,
 while the isoxide is not precipitated. Further, the weak base (the sesqui
 oxide) is, by the gradual addition of a strong base, an alkali for instance.
 precipitated <U+FB01>rst, and then afterwards the strong base,_the isoxide. More
  over by heating with a solution of chloride of ammonium, the isoxide can
  be dissolved out of the oxides R3 04, provided they have not been strongly
  heated, with disengagement of ammonia, while the sesquioxide remains
  undissolved.   It is only the oxide of cerium, Ce?’ 0‘, which cannot in this
  way be decom osed into protoxide of cerium, CeO, and a sesquioxide of
  cerium, Ce2 0 , which hitherto has not been isolated.

green body is made much more di<U+FB02>icult, and fails in many cases
in spite of the greatest care.
    It was found as the result of a great many experiments, that,
in preparing the new body, only exactly that quantity of isochlo
ride of tin must be used which is necessary to convert the isoxide
of the copper salt into quadrantoxide.
    A solution of isochloride of tin in potash is prepared which
contains 50 grammes of the latter in a litre, and so much isoxide
of tin that 30 grammes of iodine are necessary to convert it into
diploxide of tin. The heat produced by the solution of the tin
salt in the alkaline solution must be lowered by careful cooling.
To a litre of the cooled solution 300 cubic centims. of a solution
of blue vitriol, which contains 10 grammes of metallic copper,
are added, and the mixture shaken in a <U+FB02>ask, which is almost
<U+FB01>lled with it, about every <U+FB01>ve minutes, being placed in the mean
 while in cold water. In this case blue hydrated isoxide of copper
 is <U+FB01>rst precipitated, which, on continued agitation, changes into
reddish yellow semioxide, which thereupon gradually changes its
colour, and after some hours becomes olive-green. After twenty
four hours, the liquid above the precipitate, when supersaturated
with hydrochloric acid, is no longer coloured by the addition of
solution of iodine.
    For the washing out, at <U+FB01>rst water is used which contains hy
 drate of potash, and when binoxide of tin is no longer dissolved,
pure water is taken. After the removal of the hydrate of potash,
the green guadrantoxide is very slowly deposited. If then am
monia is a ded to the wash-water, the precipitate agglomerates
without undergoing any other change, and may then be rapidly
washed out with pure water. The ammonia, which does not
dissolve quadrantoxide of copper, dissolves traces both of semi
oxide and of isoxide of copper.
   On account of the very ready oxidizability of the quadrantoxide,
the washing must be performed with extreme care. Of course
water must be used which has been freed from air by continued
boiling, and has been cooled in well- closed bottles. The stopper
of the bottle was replaced by a doubly perforated caoutchouc
stopper, through one hole in which passed a tube bent below,
and which reached nearly to the surface of the precipitate, while
a short tube which ended just below the cork passed through
the other. Outside the cork both were bent at right angles.
Hydrogen gas was passed through the short tube, by which the
liquid was removed from the <U+FB02>ask. Thereupon both tubes, which
were provided with caoutchouc tubes, were closed by pinchcocks.
The hydrogen apparatus was now connected with a vessel con
taining boiled out water, of the same size and arranged in the
same manner as that in which the precipitation of the copper

        M-. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Qzides.        369
was effected. After the longer tube of the water-bottle had been
connected with the longer tube of the bottle which contained the
precipitate, the hydrogen apparatus was connected with the
shorter tube of the water-bottle. The cock of the hydrogen
apparatus, and then the pinchcocks, were successively opened,
beginning with the one nearest the hydrogen apparatus. The
<U+FB02>ask with the precipitate was <U+FB01>lled in this way with boiled-out
water, which was forced out of the vessel in which it was con
tained by hydrogen. After the wash- water had been mixed with
the precipitate by repeated shaking, the precipitate was allowed to
settle in order to repeat the operation. To the wash-water, boiled
hydrate of potash solution was added until no more tin could be
discovered in the wash-water drawn off. But this could not be
completely attained even by often repeated washing. Hence
when only traces of tin could be detected in the wash-water, the
hydrate of potash was washed out until the precipitate no longer
settled down well after washing. Ammonia was then added to
the wash-water, and the washing completed.
    Although the hydrogen was liberated as pure as possible,
 before passing into the apparatus it was led through a tube
 which contained pumice saturated with a concentrated solution
 of pyrogallate of potash. This precaution is by no means
 unnecessary, because air diffuses into the apparatus from the
 dilute sulphuric acid.
    In order to obtain small quantities of the precipitate for the
 various experiments, the larger tube in the <U+FB02>ask was depressed
 to the bottom through the precipitate, and by means of the
 hydrogen current some of the precipitate mixed with water was
 forced either into small <U+FB02>asks or into a <U+FB02>ask arranged like that
 with the precipitate, and which was closed by the wash-water.
    But notwithstanding all care, the preparation of a pure sub
 stance was not always successful, but instead of it a mixture of
 copper and of semioxide and isoxide of copper was frequently
 obtained. All the causes of failure have not been accurately
 ascertained; but they undoubtedly lie in the temperature and
 concentration of the solutions taken.    But if the preparation of
 the compound has been successful, it may be kept under water
 and protected against the access of air without being in the
 slightest degree changed.
    If the compound has been kept for some time under water
 with entire exclusion of air, it becomes gradually denser, and
 more indifferent to oxidation.
    For the purpose of analysis, a mixture of the compound with
 water was forced, in the manner described above, into a <U+FB02>ask
 which contained dilute sulphuric acid. The compound was
 immediately decomposed: while metallic copper was deposited,

  370      M. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Oxides.
 the liquid became blue from dissolved copper. After the com
 plete deposition of the copper, the solution was removed from
 the <U+FB02>ask in the manner described above, and replaced by boiled
 out water, which operation was continued until no more copper
 could be detected in the wash-water_by means of sulphuretted
 hydrogen. Both the copper deposited and that in the sulphuric
 acid solution contained tin. The latter was mixed with ammonia
 until it had only a feeble acid reaction, and it was thereupon
 boiled, by which diploxide of tin was deposited, whose weight
 was determined.     The copper was precipitated from the solution
 by sulphuretted hydrogen, the sulphide of copper ignited in a
 current of hydrogen and weighed. The precipitated metallic
 copper was dissolved in nitric acid, sulphuric acid added to the
 solution, and the same process repeated as in the case of the
 other solution.
    There were obtained—
    (1) From the sulphuric acid solution,
    0'3636 grm. semisulphuret of copper and 00348 grm. di
 ploxide of tin.
    (2) From the residue of metallic copper,
    1'O760 grm. semisulphuret of copper and 00304 grm. di
 ploxide of tin.
    If the new oxide of copper is decomposed by dilute sulphuric
 acid into isoxide of copper and metallic copper, the copper in the
 isoxide produced stands to the separated copper in the ratio of
 1 :2'959 ; hence, in the new oxide, 1 atom of oxygen is com
bined with 4 atoms (in the experiment 3'96) of copper. But

The latter was, however, only mixed with the former, and might,
by repeated and renewed treatment with hydrate of potash, have
been removed from the quadrantoxide.
   The results of a second experiment of a preparation made at
another time, which had been repeatedly puri<U+FB01>ed with hydrate
of potash, were as follows :-0469 grm. of semisulphuret of
copper was obtained from the sulphuric solution of the quadrant
oxide decomposed by sulphuric acid. It had been precipitated
along with some tin, and, after weighing, it was dissolved in nitric
acid, and then freed in the manner above described from tin;
after this puri<U+FB01>cation the semisulphuret weighed only 0432
grm. The metallic copper separated by dilute sulphuric acid
gave, after solution in nitric acid, 1'2731 grm. semisulphuret of

            M. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Oxides.      371
copper, which, after puri<U+FB01>cation from tin, weighed only 1'2501
grin. Both quantities of sulphuret of copper, which were obtained
as semisulpurets from the quadrantoxide decomposed by dilute
sulphuric acid, are in the ratio 1 : 2'9 ; and the dry quadrantoxide
of copper consisted therefore of a mixture of—

               Diploxide oftin . . . . . .             3'44
                                                    10000
     It follows indubitably from these experiments, that there is a
degree of oxidation of copper which consists of 1 atom of oxygen
united with 4 of copper, which is decomposed by dilute sulphuric
acid into an atom of sulphate of copper and 3 atoms of metallic
copper.
     If quadrantoxide of copper in its mixture with water is treated
 with dilute hydrochloric acid, there is formed at <U+FB01>rst a dark body
 (perhaps quadrantichloride of copper), but on agitation metallic
 copper is separated, above which is a layer of white semichloride
 of copper, which, on further agitation, dissolves up entirely in
 the excess of hydrochloric acid. Undoubtedly the quadrantoxide
 is decomposed by hydrochloric acid into an atom of semichloride,
 and into 2 atoms of metallic copper.
      If sulphuretted hydrogen is added to the mixture of qua
  drantoxide with water, it is changed after agitation into a black
 body, which long remains suspended in the liquid. The black
 body has quite the appearance of a homogeneous body, and not
 that of a mixture of isosulphuret and semisulphuret with metal
 lic copper, and is therefore a quadrantisulphuret. But if it stands
  for some time with an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen, it begins
  to decompose; a disengagement of hydrogen takes place, and
  the quadrantisulphuret is changed into a higher sulphuret; but
  into what sulphuret it passes has not been made out.
      If the mixture of quadrantoxide of copper is treated with
  aqueous hydrocyanic acid, it is also changed into ahomogeneous
  black body, which is quadranticyanide of copper. lt readily
  dissolves in dilute sulphuric acid at ordinary temperatures with
   disengagement of red fumes, and forms a blue solution; the
   solution smells of hydrocyanic acid, and gives with nitrate of
   silver a copious precipitate of semicyanide of silver. If a solu
   tion of nitrate of silver is poured upon the quadranticyanide,
   a blue solution is formed, and a blackish-brown mixture of
   semicyanide of silver and metallic silver is formed. If this is
   treated with nitric acid, a blue solution of nitrate of isoxide of
   copper is formed, and semicyanide of silver is left.
       If the moist quadrantoxide of copper is treated with ammonia,
   it is not dissolved, and is thus characteristically distinguished

372        M. H. Rose on a new Series of Metallic Oxides.
from semioxide and isoxide of copper. But if only a limited
access of air is permitted, the green quadrantoxide is <U+FB01>rst
covered with a yellow coating of semioxide of copper, and
gradually the supernatant liquid becomes somewhat blue.
Even when a mixture of ammonia and carbonate of ammonia is
used, quadrantoxide of copper undergoes not the least change if
air is completely excluded.
    By these experiments it is shown that the compound prepared
is a de<U+FB01>nite oxide of copper, of a constitution not hitherto sus
pected, except in the case of the quadrantoxide of silver.            That
the oxide of silver, which hitherto has been called suboxide of
silver consists of 4 atoms of silver and 1 of oxygen, can now be
as little doubted as the necessity for halving the atomic weight
of silver which has previously been adopted. Quadrantoxide of
copper and quadrantoxide of silver belong to the same group.
The oxides also, which are generally called suboxide of copper
and oxide of silver, and which are semioxides, belong to one and
the same group; as do the oxides which are called binoxide of
silver and oxide of copper, which are isoxides. The properties
of both these oxides (of the same atomic composition) are, it is
true, very different ; for hitherto it has not been possible to com
bine isoxide of silver with acids to form salts, as in the case of
isoxide of copper. On the other hand, no chemist will doubt
the atomic weight of copper, or the atomic composition of the
hitherto known oxides of copper, and call what is known as oxide
of copper a diploxide, and the so-called suboxide of copper an
isoxide.
    I have stated above that the number of metallic quadrant
oxides is probably by no means small; I must even assume that
the group is numerous.
   Bunsen has succeeded in removing by electrolysis chlorine from
the chlorides of alkaline metals, especially from chloride of
potassium, chloride of rubidium, and chloride of caesium, and
changing them into lower chlorides of intense smalt-blue colour,
which dissolve in the fused metallic chlorides*. These chlo
rides can be prepared without electricity by fusing potassium
with chloride of potassium in a current of hydrogen. An intense
dark blue saline mass is thus obtained which dissolves in water,
liberating hydrogen and forming chloride and hydrated alkali.
Chloride of sodium fused with sodium in a current of hydrogen
gives a bluish-grey fused mass 1". It may be assumed with great

   1' The blue rock-salt which occurs in nature does not owe it blue colour
to quadrantichloride of sodium, or rather potassium. The clear blue rock
salt of Stassfurth is not uniformly coloured; along with clear blue cubes
there are some well-de<U+FB01>ned perfectly colourless cubes, as well as some

probability that these subchlorides contain half as much chlorine
as the chlorides from which they are prepared. But the oxides
and chlorides of the alkaline metals are not isoxides and isochlo
rides, but semioxides and semichlorides, and the atomic weights
of the <U+FB01>ve known alkaline metals (as well as that of thallium) must
be divided by 2. These subchlorides are then quadrantichlorides,
to which quadrantoxides probably correspond; the latter will
probably,- however, be di<U+FB02>icult of preparation. The group of
quadrantoxides might then be called a large one *.

 CONSIDER the integral equation
                             As’ + 2Bz + C = 0,
 where z is the constant of integration : the derived equation is
            Q. = (AC' + A’C — 2BB')2 —4(AC — B’) (A'C' — B")

  which are reddish brown in colour. The blue coloured cubes consist onl
  of chloride of sodium (with a very small quantity of sulphate of soda); the
  colourless and the reddish brown ones contain a great deal of chloride of
  potassium; the colourless ones 2 atoms chloride of potassium and l of
  chloride of sodium, hence 73 per cent. chloride of potassium.
     A similar relation prevails in the case of the blue rock-salt of Kalucz in
  Galicia. In these also, blue coloured cubes trench on perfectly colourless
  ones. The latter consist of chloride of sodium only, the former of pure
  chloride of potassium without any mixture of chloride of sodium. At the
  same time there are cubes which are of a faint brownish colour, and yet
  contain no chloride of otassium, but consist of pure chloride of sodium.
     Not in all cases do t e colourless cubes, which lie close to the blue ones,
  contain much chloride of otassium, or consist of it, while the blue salt
  contains none. Bluisli-co oured rock-salt of Hallstadt was found to be
  quite free from chloride of potassium (it sometimes contained very small
  quantities) ; but the adjacent colourless cubes consisted also of chloride of
   potassium. Something similar was found in the case of a feebly blue
   rock-salt from Wieliczka.
      The bluislrcoloured rock-salt, like the colourless, forms a perfectly
  colourless solution which has no alkaline reaction. All kinds of the blue
   rock-salt, even those which are tolerably intensely coloured, like that of
   Kalucz, give rise to no disengagement of hydrogen when dissolved.

   was only by his skilful arrangement of the apparatus that it was ossible
   to prepare the very oxidizable quadrantoxide of copper; and I coniess that
   without his help I could not have obtained the results I have described.

   and if for greater simplicity we write A= 1, then the derived
   equation is
                      .Q=C'2—4.¢BC'B'+4CB'9=0,
   corresponding to the integral equation
                             2’ + 2B2 + C = 0.
   Writing the integral equation under the form
                            (z+X)(z+Y)=0,
   we have
                         2B=X+Y,        C=XY,
   whence also
                    2B'=X'+Y',        C'=XY' +X'Y,
   and the derived equation becomes
                             = —(X—Y)’X'Y',
      And if we represent the roots X, Y in the form P—|_- Q,/E],
   so that P= --B, Q,‘/[_]= 4/B’——AC, Q’ being the greatest
   square factor of B*—AC, then
          (X-Y)@=4Qa:1, X’, Y'=P' i (ox/E| + m          QB: ,
                XIYI = P12 _ 4% (2QrE| + Qnqas
_ and the derived equation is
               Q= —Q*{4|3P"—(2QI|3 +Q|:|r)2} =0.
     If B, C, &c. are functions of the coordinates (.z', y), the equa
  tion z*+2Bz+ C=O (2 an arbitrary constant) represents a series
  of curves in the plane of my ; but if we consider 2 as a coordi
  nate, then the equation represents a surface, and the curves
  in question are the orthogonal projections on the plane of any of
  the sections of the surface by the planes parallel to the plane of
  my. To <U+FB01>x the ideas, the plane of my may be taken to be hori
  zontal, and the ordinates 2 vertical.
     Writing the equation in the form
                        (Z+B)’—(B’-C)=0,
  we see that the surface contains upon it the curve z+B=O,
  B*—C=O, which is the line of contact with the circumscribed
  vertical cylinder: such curve may be termed the envelope, or,
  when this is necessary, the complete envelope. The equation of
  the surface has however been taken to be (z—P)’—Q’D =0
  (viz. it has been assumed that B= —P, B*—C=QQ El ) ; the
  envelope thus breaks up into the curve (z—P=O, Q=0) taken
  twice, and the curve z—P=O, U =0 ; the former of these is in

        Prof. Cayley on Dz<U+FB02>erential Equations and Umbilici.                 375
general a nodal curve on the surface, and it may be spoken of as
the nodal curve; the latter of them is the reduced or proper
envelope, or simply the envelope. And the terms nodal curve
and envelope may also be applied to the curves Q==O and U =0,
which are the projections on the plane of my of the <U+FB01>rst-men
tioned two curves respectively. There is however a case of
higher singularity which it is proper to consider. Suppose that
Q and U have a common factor K, say Q=KR, U =KV. The
complete envelope Q‘‘ U =R9K3V=0 here breaks up into the
nodal curve R=0 twice, the cuspidal curve K=O three times,
and the reduced or proper envelope V=0 once.
    Reverting for a moment to the form (2'+X) (z+Y) =0,
the derived equation (2: -(X—Y)*X'Y' =0 is satis<U+FB01>ed by
£X_—Y_)9?O, tilhis _equ:la.tion, lortsay tl}ét1i1qua1tif(i)‘n oftthle envelope,

This assumes however that the differential equation is given_in
the form in which it is immediately obtained by derivation from
the integral equation, without the rejection of factors which are
functions of the coordinates (.12, 3/) only. It is proper to con
sider the reduced equation obtained by rejecting such factors.
Thus if X and Y are rational functions, the reduced form is
X'Y'= 0, which is no longer satis<U+FB01>ed by the equation (X— Y)9=g
In the before-mentioned case where the roots are P iQ4/ |:|
 (or (X—Y)’=Q9[]), P, Q, and El, being rational functions of
 (x, y), the derived equation
              Q=_Q2{4UP!2_(2QI D +QDI)2} =0
 divides out by the factor Q’, but it does not divide out by U;
the reduced form is therefore
                     4 l:|P"— (2Q' El +Q |:')*=0,
 which is not satis<U+FB01>ed by Q,=O, while it is still satis<U+FB01>edb El =0
 (since this gives also |_'_|'=O) ; that is, the nodal curve =0 is
 not a solution of the differential equation, but we still have the
 singular solution [1 =0, which corresponds to the reduced or
 Proper envelope. In the case Q=KR,E] =KV of a cuspidal
 curve, the above form of the differential equation becomes
           4KVP"'— {3KK'RV + K’(2VR' + V'R)}9=O,
 which divides out by K ; and when reduced by the rejection of
 this factor, it is no longer satis<U+FB01>ed by the equation K=O, which
 belongs to the cuspidal curve; that is, neither the nodal curve
 I_i=0 nor the cuspidal curve K=O is a solution of the di<U+FB01>'eren
 tial equation, but we still have the singular solutionV =0, which
 corresponds to the reduced or proper envelope. It would appear

376     Prof. Cayley on Dz<U+FB01>erential Equations and Umbilici.
that the conclusion may be extended to singularities of ahigher
nature, viz. the factor corresponding to any singular curve which
presents itself as part of the complete envelope divides out from
the derived equation; and such singular curve does not consti
tute a solution of the reduced equation, but we have a singular
solution corresponding to the reduced or proper envelope.
                                   II.
   Consider the differential equation
                       .1/(P’— 1) + 2"'~17>= 0,
where, to <U+FB01>x the ideas, m> or =1 ; the integral equation may
be taken to be
       z= (mm + \/mix“ + _1/*‘)(m.z"2 + yii +.z"\/m*.z* + _z/§)'"";
or rather, writing for shortnes E] = mix’Z + y'*, and putting
        z= (m.z+\/E)(mw9+y’+.z'\/_5)""'=P-|-Q‘/E,
the integral equation is
         (z—P)9—Q2E| =0, or z9—2Pz+P‘*—Q'2El =0,
where
          P’—Q’ E1 = (m*»*— E1) %<»w*+.1<U+FB02>>*—w* E1 %'""
                    __ 2m{y2+2m__1xQ}m-1.
In the particular case m: 1 the equation is
               z=.2:+ 4/.z_9+_1/9-, or z9—2z.z'—y-'*=O.
Before going further, I remark that, m being a positive integer
greater than unity, we have
    z=P+ QN/E =m.2:(m.z"'+_1/")"'_l
            + <mw’+z/’ + 571m-T2) (mw’+z/’)""’\/ E? + 8w»
the subsequent terms being divisible, the rational ones by E] , and
the irrational ones by El\/            Hence, observing that
              m.z*Q+y*+ (m—1)m.z9=m9.z'*+y9= [1,
we see that Q contains the factor El, and the equation D =0
belongs to a cuspidal curve on the surface. If however m=l,
then the equation is 2=.z'+\/ l_]—, so that Q, =1 does not con
tain the factor E] ; and E] =.z"+ _z/9:0 is not a singular curve on
the surface, but is in fact the reduced or proper envelope.
   The curve represented by the integral equation will pass
through the origin (.z'=0, _1/=0) for the value z=O of the con

        Prof. Cayley on Dz<U+FB02>erential Equations and Umbilici.        377
stant of integration.    In fact, for this value, the integral equation
becomes
                   — M1/*+<2m—1>w*}"-‘=0,
 which belongs to a set of 2m + (m- 1) + (m- l) lines coinciding
with the lines _1/=0, y=ia."\/2m—l, and 3/: -i.z~\/2m—I
respectivel . The directions at the origin are therefore p=O,
11: i i\/ gm—1, which are the same values of p as are obtained
from the differential equation; viz. since this is satis<U+FB01>ed identi
cally at the point in question, proceeding to the derived equation,
we have
                      P(1=’—1) +2m1>=0;
that is,
                      p(p*+2m—1)=O.
 But it is to be observed that these values of p are different from
the values given by the equation [1 =m’.z*’+y =0, which are
p= iim. The reason is that the curve U =0 being, as was
shown, a cuspidal curve on the surface, the equation I] :0 is not
a solution of the differential equation.
   If however m=1, then the integral equation gives at the
origin no longer three values of p, but only the value p=O.
The di<U+FB01>'erential_equation however gives, as in the general case,
three values; VIZ. we have p(p*+1)=O. And the values 1;: ii
obtained from the factor p*+ 1 =0 are precisely the values of p
obtained from the equation El =w’+ _1/‘=0, which in the case
now under consideration belongs to the reduced or proper enve
lope of the surface, and is therefore the singular solution of the
differential equation.
                                  III.
   The two curves of curvature which pass through any given
point of a surface are distinct curves, not branches of one inde
composable curve. In fact if P, Q are the two curves of curvature
for a point A, then for a point A’ on P the two curves of curva
ture will be P, Q’; and if P, Q were branches of an indecom
posable curve, then P, Q’ would also be branches of an indecom
posable curve, and we should have P a branch of two different
indecomposable curves, which is of course impossible. In the
case of an umbilicus, the two curves P and Q coincide together;
or, as we may express it, the curves of curvature through an
umbilicus are the duplication of a single, in general indecom
posable curve; and in general this curve has at the umbilicus a
 tri<U+FB01>d node. I use this expression to denote a point at which
 there are three distinct tangents, or, more accurately, three
 distinct directions of the curve: an ordinary triple point is of

  necessity a tri<U+FB01>d node, but not conversely. The umbilicus of an
  ellipsoid or other quadric surface is a peculiar exceptional case.
     In support of the foregoing conclusions, consider a surface
  having an umbilicus at the origin, and take z=0 as the equa
  tion of the tangent plane at that point ; the equation of the sur
  face in the neighbourhood of the umbilicus will be
            z= §k(.z“’ -1- 3/9) + 1'; (01.3 + 3bz'°y + 3c.z'_1/2+ d_1/3) ;
  so that, writing as usual p and q for the <U+FB01>rst, and r, s, t for the
  second differential coe<U+FB01>icients of z, we have
                      p=Ic.z* +§ (a.z'9+ 2b.z*_1/+ c_1/Q),
                      q= kg/+ %(b.'/2'2 + 2cx_2,/+ d_1/9),
                      r=Ic+a.z'+by,
                      s=         b:v+cg/,
                       t=Ic+c.z'+dy.
     The differential equation of the curves of curvature projected
  on the plane of xy is
(%, "Lo +r'>s—pqr1 + % [<1 +q*>r—<1+1»*>¢1 - [<1 +p*>»-mr1=o.
   and substituting therein the foregoing values of p, q, r, s, 1!, but
   attending only to the terms of the lowest order in (:2, y), and
   using moreover in the sequel 1) in the place of 5%, the equation
   becomes     (5-'"+¢?/i)(P2-'1l+[(“-°)‘”+(b-4)!/lP=O$
   which may be taken as the differential equation of the curves of
   curvature at and in the neighbourhood of the umbilicus.                 The
   equation is satis<U+FB01>ed identically by the values .z'=O, g/=0, which
   correspond to the umbilicus; and to <U+FB01>nd p, we have to differen
   tiate the equation, and then substitute these values of .2‘ and y ;
   we thus obtain
               (l>+¢1>)(P’—l)+ Us-¢) +(1>-d)11]1>=0.

      I remark that we may without loss of generality write d=O ;
   but to simplify the investigation, I suppose in the <U+FB01>rst instance
   that we have also b=O. This comes to assuming that one of
   the three planes aa3+3bz2y+3c.ry9+dy3=O bisects the angle

 curve through the umbilicus is

 so that the umbilicus is a tri<U+FB01>d node.           In the case however of

                 LIV. Remarks on Chemical Notation.
                By WILLIAM ODLING, M.B., F.R.S.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal. .
        GENTLEMEN,
 IN your last Number, Mr. J. J. Waterston brings forward some
       interesting views on chemical notation, which he considers
 antagonistic to the notions propounded by me in a semipopular
 lecture upon an entirely di<U+FB01>'erent subject, which I delivered a
 little while back at the Royal Institution, and upon which he
 accordingly goes out of his way to make a not very courteous
 onslaught, affirming that chemists in general, and Mr. Graham
 and myself in particular, are not so well acquainted as we ought
to be with the relations subsisting between atoms, molecules,
volumes, and formulae.
    Wherefore, in order to set us right, he tells us with exquisite
 gravity what it is that the dynamical theory proclaims as a fact—
 namely, that “ all molecules, simple or compound, in the gaseous
 state, occupy the same volume,”—intelligence scarcely less start
 ling than he might have imparted by saying that, according
 to a fundamental rule in arithmetic, the sum of two and two
 is always four.
    Again, in the <U+FB01>rst paragraph of his communication, he
charges me with having contended that the molecular weight of
water must be represented by the number 18, and “cannot be
9, as might be inferred from the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the vapour,
&c.” Now I certainly never before heard that the vapour-den
sity of any given body pointed to some particular number as the
expression of its molecular weight, but looked upon it as merely
showing the comparative molecular weight of that body in rela
tion to the molecular weight of some other body chosen as a
standard; and taking the molecular weight of hydrogen as a
standard, the molecular weight of water will, I conceive, be 9,
or 18, or 1125, according as we take 1 (Dalton), or 2 (Laurent
and Gerhardt), or 12'5 (Berzelius) for the molecular weight of
hydrogen. My argument, by which I till abide, was simply
this: if the molecular weight of muriatic acid is 365, then the
molecular weight of water is 18, and not 9.
    In illustration of what I believe to be the generally received
opinion among modern chemists as to the correlation of volume
and formula—-an opinion very di<U+FB01>"erent from that attributedto
them by Mr. Waterston—I have written down in column I. the
ordinarily recognized molecular formulae of a few well~known
bodies. Each of these formulae represents the same bulk of gas,
whether that bulk be considered as 1, 2, 3, 4, or 100 volumes.

   Now, if all the above formulae be halved, as Mr. Waterston sug
gests, but not newly suggests, or if they be doubled, or trebled,
or quadrupled, they will still all of them represent one and the
same bulk of gas, which may still be considered as 1, 2, 3, 4, or
100 volumes.
   At present a large section of chemists, more especially of
foreign chemists, who use the comparable formulae given in
column 1., select a quadruple volume for their molecular unit,
while a majority, I believe, prefer for various reasons to look
upon the bulk expressed by each of the above formulae as corre
sponding to two volumes, or they take a double volume for
their molecular unit; but both parties are perfectly aware that
these are mere matters of convention, and that each formula
might equally well be considered to represent one volume only.
   For myself, however, I fully admit that the relative advantages
of a 1-volume and a 2-volume unit, as discussed by Mr. Water
ston, and the best mode of constructing a 1-volume notation,
whether by integral or fractional formula, are topics which,
though not by any means novel, are well worthy of serious con
sideration on their own bases—that is to say, quite irrespective of
my lecture, which had nothing whatever to do with them.
   But Mr. Waterston’s impression, that what are known as Ger
hardt’s formulae must necessarily be halved, and consequently
fractional, as shown in column II., in order to correspond re
spectively with one gaseous volume, is altogether opposed to the
long-established general understanding, and, I would add, though
I have no wish to discuss the point, is not, in my opinion, well
founded.
   Thus on page 83 of Laurent’s posthumous Me’!/rode de Clzimie,
published so long ago‘ as l854, and, I think, in some of his earlier
memoirs, it is distinctly stated that Gerhardt’s formulae may be
taken to represent one volume only. He says, “ La notation par

382             Mr. W. Odling on Chemical Notation.
1 volume serait donc exactement la meme que la notation par 2
volumes.”                  -
    At any rate, when looked upon in this manner, not as “ actually
representing two gaseous molecules,” but as corresponding each
to a single volume, Gerhardt’s formulae given in column I. will,
I should think, even in Mr. Waterston’s opinion, be quite in
accordance with the view which regards “the ultimate moving
part of all the primary gases as consisting of at least two chemical
atoms, &c.',” and will also fully recognize that “ splitting of the
gaseous molecule of oxygen into two equal parts when combining
with hydrogen to form water ” which, thanks to the chemical
researches of Brodie and Laurent, is now an old story*.
    The object of my lecture at the Royal Institution, which has
had the misfortune to fall under Mr. Waterston’s censures, was
 not to advocate a 2-volume notation as opposed to a I-volume
 notation—indeed my personal preference is inclined the other
 way—but to show on chemical grounds that the chemical mole
 cule of water, if I may so say, is identical with its physical mo~
 lecule, and consequently that this molecule1' contains, not, as
 was formerly held, the same amount of hydrogen, but double the
 amount of hydrogen contained in the molecule of muriatie acid.
 Or, in other words, that the molecular weights of water, muriatie
 acid, and hydrogen are to one another as 18 : 36'5 : 2, or as
    * Brodie, in publishing some further experiments on the subject, has
 recentl given the following resume’ of his conclusion originally announced
 in 185 . “On these ideas, as we regard the weight of two volumes of
 oxygen, that is to say the weight of a molecule of ox gen, O’, as differing
from the weight of two volumes, that is, the weight 0 a molecule of water,
H20, in the fact that this weight contains sixteen parts of oxygen in the
place of two of hydrogen, so do we regard the event of the synthesis or
diaeresis of oxygen as differing from the event of the synthesis or diaeresis
of water, in the fact that in the one change the two atoms of oxygen ful<U+FB01>l
the same functions, and are respectively in the same polar conditions as the
two atoms of hydrogen and the one atom of oxygen in the other. This
theory is of a purely relative character; it is connected with no special
hypothesis as to the nature of oxygen or water, but it states that, if we make
a certain assertion as to the molecular nature of water, we must, in con
sistency, make certain parallel assertions as to the molecular nature of
oxygen. Our molecular hypotheses may change, but this relation will still
remain.” (Phil. Trans. 1862, p. 837.) Laurent’s research had reference
chie<U+FB02>y to the dual character of the chlorine molecule, Cl’.
   1' In accordance with the views of the school of chemists to which I
belong, the chemical and physical molecules of all bodies should be iden
tical; but, owing doubtless to defective knowledge, some exceptions must
for the present be admitted. Thus there is no known chemical molecule
of sulphur corresponding to the physical molecule of sulphur-vapour at
500°, which is ninety-six times as heavy as that of hydrogen; and, on the
other hand, there is no known physical molecule of phosphorus-vapour
corresponding to the ordinary chemical molecule of phosphorus, which is
thirty-one times as heavy as that of hydrogen.

                 Mr. W. Odling on Chemical Notation.                  383
9: 18'25 : 1—a conclusion for which I certainly did not expect
to be reproached by a thermo-molecular physicist.
    Now the determination of this point depends almost entirely
upon a consideration of the molecular relations subsisting between
water, hydrate of sodium, and oxide of sodium, and between
water, alcohol, and ether (for I have yet to learn when “the
chemical evidence with respect to the formation of ether and
decomposition of alcohol” ceased to be “ deemed of import
ance”) ; that is to say, upon the question whether the molecules
of hydrate of sodium and hydrate of ethyle contain double the
amount of oxygen, or the same amount of oxygen as the mole
eule of water; in which last case the three molecules will
be represented by integral formulae thus, HQO, HNaO, and
 H(C’H’)O; or by fractional formulae thus, HO*, H‘iNa‘iOI1
and H*(cH**)o**.
   _But this is a question which it is obviously impossible to argue
 with a gentleman who, in opposition to the interpretation which
 has gradually forced itselfupon the reluctant minds of a majority
 of the most distinguished chemists of all nations, disposes of the
 whole matter offhand by asserting ez cat/zedni, “ Now the fact is,
 that two molecules of water are engaged in forming one molecule
 of the hydrate ”1'.
     It would at the same time be gratifying to learn how and when
 this very decisive fact was ascertained, and by whom. Probably
 by some favoured “mathematical student of thermo-molecular
 physics,” from whose transcendental faculties nothing chemical
 is concealed, rather than by a mere ploddingchemist whose most
 inspired notions are but of the earth, earthy.
     In conclusion, I would suggest to Mr. Waterston that when
 he again condescends to direct, with no uncertain voice, poor
 benighted chemists into the right path, he should <U+FB01>rst make
    ' The volume of a chemical equivalent of sodium         = 15) has 110%
 been ascertained, but from analogy is believed to be the same as that of
 hydrogen and ethyle; whence we have Gerhardt’s molecular formulae for
 the sodic derivatives of hydrogen, muriatic acid, water, ammonia, marsh
 gas, alcohol, and nitric acid, namely Na’, NaCl, NaHO, NaH‘*’N, NaH"“(lJ,

  ‘Elements of Chemistry,’ Mr. Waterston writes, “In the above extract
  HK6 represents one molecule of the hydrate of potash, but HH9 repre
  sents two molecules of water, and KK9 two molecules of anhydrous potash."
  Be this as it may, I am permitted by Mr. Watts, the author of the Sup
  plement, to state that the three formulae were meant to express a single
 molecule each, the three quantities represented being exactly comparable.

perhaps desirable, they are nevertheless not quite so ignorant of
thermo-molecular physics as he now seems to imagine.

    P.S.—In your review of Mr. Watts’s ‘Dictionary of Che
mistry,’ after praising my article on atomic weights, for which
accept my best thanks, you say that you do not agree with my
conclusion that Gerhardt’s scale of atomic weights affords a satis
factory representation of the present state of knowledge, but
that, on the contrary, a consistent application of the spirit of
Gerhardt’s reforms would lead us now to go much further than
he did. My conclusion certainly was, when writing the article
in question, that Gerhardt’s system, with a slight extension,
afforded a tolerably satisfactory representation of the then state
of knowledge. But I quite agree with you that, in consequence
of researches made more particularly within the last two or three
years, a much further extension in the direction advocated by
Messrs. Cannizzaro and Wurtz is now required, which extension I
am to have an opportunity of discussing in some future Number
of the Dicti0nary.—W. 0.
   LV. Note on Laplace’s Correction for the Velocity of Sound.
                    By Joan TYNDALL, F.R.S.*
 NEWTON calculated the theoretic velocity of sound in air,
         and found that it differed from the observed velocity by
about one-sixth of the whole amount. Laplace accounted for
this discrepancy by showing that over and above the changes of
 elasticity due to changes of density, of which alone Newton took
 account, the effective elasticity of the medium is augmented by
 the changes of temperature which occur in the condensations and
rarefactions of the sonorous wave. He succeeded in proving
that, to obtain the true velocity of sound in air, Newton’s result
would have to be multiplied by the square root of the quotient
obtained by dividing the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air at constant pressure
by its speci<U+FB01>c heat at constant volume. This ratio was not at
the command of Laplace; but in the absence of experiment, and
knowing that the velocity of sound in air had been determined
with extreme accuracy, he reversed the process, and deduced from
                  4‘ Communicated by the Author.

                    for the Velocity of Sound.          '       385
the velocity of sound the ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c heats.         It
was found to be 1421.
   We now know that the excess of this number above unity,
namely 0421, expresses the amount of heat consumed in external
work when the air is allowed to expand under constant pressure ;
and from this number we can at once deduce the mechanical
equivalent of heat. The almost absolute identity of the equiva
lent thus found, with that established by Mr. Joule by direct
experiment, leaves no shadow of doubt upon the mind as to the
correctness of Laplace’s result.
   Still, notwithstanding this striking veri<U+FB01>cation, and the great
ness of the names connected with this question, I have for some
years thought it probable that the legitimacy of Laplace’s pro
ceeding in calculating the ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c heats depends
upon an accident. At the time he wrote, and for a long time
subsequently, it was universally believed that elastic <U+FB02>uids pos
sessed no sensible radiative power; and the practical absence
of this power is virtually assumed in his calculation. He sup
posed that the heat and the cold produced their full effect in
changing the elasticity of the air ; that there was no loss of
heat either by radiation or conduction ; and he would at the time
have extended the same assumption to elastic <U+FB02>uids generally,
and deduced from any one of them the ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c
heats.
   The point to which I now wish to direct attention is whether,
in the present state of our knowledge, this extension of the
assumption is warranted; and whether the correctness of La
place’s result may not depend upon a peculiarity of air unproved
in his day, but which distinguishes it from most other elastic _
<U+FB02>uids.
   My experiments taught me some years ago, and every addi
tional day’s experience only con<U+FB01>rms the result, that air pos
sesses no sensible power of absorption or radiation ,- hence a con
densation in air, in presence of its associated rarefaction, has no
sensible power to neutralize, by radiation, the differences of tem
perature in the condensed and dilated portions of the sonorous
wave.     But while air is thus neutral, other gases, ammonia and
ole<U+FB01>ant gas for example, show themselves competent to absorb
80 or 90 per cent. of the entire radiation from an obscure source ;
and they possess a radiative power proportionate to their enormous
absorbing power. Let us imagine then a series of sonorous waves
propagated through an atmosphere of ole<U+FB01>ant gas ; every heated
condensation is a powerful radiator, and every chilled dilatation
is a powerful absorber. These two portions of a wave cannot, I
think, subsist for an instant in the presence of each other with
out loss of heat on the one hand, and gain on the other. The

386     Note on Laplace’s Correction for the Velocity of Sound.
tendency certainly is to diminish that portion of the elastic force
on which the correction of Laplace depends; and hence the velo
city of sound in such a medium ought to approximate more to
that deduced from the formula of Newton than its velocity in
air. It is hard to conceive that this effect could be prevented
by the rapidity of the vibrations. From the moment any mole
cule receives, by the act of condensation, an accession to its calo
ri<U+FB01>c motion, that motion is in part wasted upon the aether in
which the molecule wings. No conceivable rapidity of sono
rous vibration can, I think, prevent this loss from taking place;
and if it take place in any sensible degree, the correction of
Laplace would be no longer applicable, nor could a correct ratio
be deduced from the velocity of sound in the medium.
    The necessary data exist for the determination of the theoretic
velocity of sound in ole<U+FB01>ant and other gases, and from its pitch
in organ-pipes its actual velocity in any gas may be deduced.
We are thus in a position to compare the actual and theoretical
velocities, and to deduce from them the ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c
heats. If then the radiative power of the gas comes sensibly
into play, it will diminish the actual velocity, and therefore
make the ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c heats appear less than in the
case of air. Conversely, if the ratio for the gas be less than that
found for air, it would show that a partial equalization of tem
perature between the condensed and rare<U+FB01>ed portions of the
sonorous wave had been effected by the radiative power of the gas.
    In the state indicated by this reasoning, the question rested
in my mind for a considerable time ; and it is not entirely without
di<U+FB01>idence that I now bring it forward. I had thought of an ap
paratus with a view of testing the question, forgetting that the
ratio of the two speci<U+FB01>c heats had been determined in this very
way by a celebrated experimenter. Dulong, it is well known, pur
sued this very method in the case of seven gases, three of which
were elementary, and four compound *. For the elementary gases
he found a ratio which was sensibly the same as that found for air ;
this, according to my reasoning, would prove the absence of
radiative power on the part of the elementary gases,—-a result in
exact accordance with my experiments. For the compound gases '
he found ratios sensibly less than that found for air, and least of
all for ole<U+FB01>ant gas, which, according to my experiments, is the
greatest radiator. In the case of this gas the excess of the
ratio above unity is little more than half what it is in the case of
air. Dulong of course drew from his experiments conclusions
very different from those to which my reasoning points, and which,
I submit, need reconsideration.           In this state for the present
I leave the question to the appreciation of philosophers.             Apart

interesting and beautiful result if, from a thing apparently so
remote as the velocity of sound, we could deduce it priori the fact

LVI. On the Application ofBarycentric Perspective to the Trans
   formation of Structures. By W. J. Macouoas RANKINE,
    C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS.L. 25" E.*
1. THIS paper contains the substance of some remarks which
           I made at the recent Meeting of the British Association,
on the elegant investigation by Professor Sylvester of the princi
ples of Barycentric Perspective and Homalographic Projection.
    2. In the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society ’ for the 6th of
March 1856, I published a theorem called that of “the Trans
formation of Structures,” which may be brie<U+FB02>y expressed as
 follows :
   If a structure of a given <U+FB01>gure be balanced and stable under
forces represented by given lines, then will any structure whose
<U+FB01>gure is a parallel projection of the original <U+FB01>gure be balanced and
stable under forces represented by the corresponding projections of
the lines representing the original forces.
    3. By a parallel projection of a<U+FB01>gure is meant a <U+FB01>gure derived
from the original <U+FB01>gure by altering the coordinates in uniform
proportions, or by substituting oblique for rectangular coordi
nates; and it is called parallel because to every pair of equal
and parallel lines in the original <U+FB01>gure there correspond a pair of
equal and parallel lines in the transformed <U+FB01>gure. For example,
 every orthographic projection of a plane <U+FB01>gure is a parallel pro
jection ; all ellipsoids are parallel projections of each other and
 of a sphere, &c.
    4. That theorem was applied in ‘ A Manual of Applied Me
 chanics’ to the deduction of the <U+FB01>gures of a skew arch and of a
 ramping arch from that of a common arch, of an equilibrated rib
 from a common catenary, of arches for supporting earth from
 arches for supporting the pressure of a liquid, &c.
    5. Its applications, however, were limited by the condition of
parallel projection; and there were consequently many conceiv
 able transformations of structures to which it could not be
 applied.
                    * Communicated by the Author.

 388           Mr. W. J. M. Rankine on the Eapansive
     6. The theorems discovered by Mr. Sylvester now afford the
 means of greatly extending the art of designing structures by
 transformation from structures of more simple <U+FB01>gures ; for they
 obviously give at once the solution of the question—given the
<U+FB01>gure of a structure which is balanced and stable under a load dis
 tributed in a given way; given also any perspective or h0malogra
 phic projection of that <U+FB01>gure; to <U+FB01>nd how the load must be dis
 tributed on the transformed structure in order that it also may be
 balanced and stable.
     7'. This is not the <U+FB01>rst instance in which theorems of pure
 science have proved to be capable of practical applications unex
 pected, perhaps, by their discoverers.
           LVII. On the Expansive Energy of Heated Water.
 By W. J. Macquonn RANKINE, C.E., LL.D., F.R.SS.L. §* E.*
 AS the question of the quantity of mechanical energy which
          a given weight of water, heated to a given temperature, is
capable of exerting in the act of partially evaporating without
 receiving heat until it falls to a given lower temperature, has
been raised in connexion with recent researches as to the burst
ing of steam-boilers, I may point out that the complete solution
of that question for any given liquid, together with a numerical
example in the case of water, is given under the head of Propo
sition XVII. of a paper on Thermo-dynamics, which was commu
nicated by me to the Royal Society in December 1853, read in
 January 1854, and published in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1854.
    That solution is expressed by the following formula (page 161,

 that the mechanical energy in column 2 is the equivalent of the
 heat which disappears during the process, being the difference
 between the whole heat expended and the latent heat of that
 portion of the water which at the end of the process is in the
condition of steam at atmospheric pressure.

         “ On the Change of Form assumed by Wrought Iron and other
 Metals when Heated and then Cooled by partial Immersion in Water.”
 By Lieut.-Col. H. Clerk, R.A., F.R.S.
     Origin of the E.zperiments.——A short time ago, when about to
  shoe :1 wheel with a hoop-tire, to which it was necessary to give a
  bevel of about {-the of an inch, one of the workmen employed sug
  gested that the bevel could be given by heating the tire red~hot and
  then immersing it one-half its depth in cold water. This was tried,
  and found to answer perfectly, that portion of the tire which was
  out of the water being reduced in diameter. The tire was 3 inches
  wide, % inch thick, and 4' 2" in diameter.
     As this result was curious and not generally known, I considered
  it desirable to institute some further experiments in order to try how
  far, by successive beatings and coolings, this change of form could be
  augmented, and also whether the same effect could be produced on
  other metals than wrought iron.
      Mode of carrying out the Ecperiments.—The experiments were
  made on cylinders of wrought iron of di<U+FB01>"erent dimensions, both

 hollow and solid; immersed, some to one-half of their depth, others
 to two-thirds; also on similar cylinders of cast iron, steel, zinc, tin,
 and n-metal.
    TE: specimens experimented on were all accurately turned in a
 lathe to the required dimensions, which were carefully noted; they
 were_then heated to a red heat in a wood-furnace used for heating
 the tires of wheels. As soon as they had acquired the proper heat,
 they were taken out and immersed in water to one-half or two-thirds
 of their depth (as stated in the oeiipiipiment). The temperature of
 the water ran ed from 60 to 70 a r.
    The speciigens were allowed to remain in the water about two
 minutes, in which time the portion in the air had lost all redness,
 and that in the water had become su<U+FB02>iciently cool to handle. These
 alternate heatings and coolings were repeated till the metal showed

           crackin or were     way. after every <U+FB01>ve beatings. The cir
cumferences were measured iln preference to the diameters, as the true
 circular form was liable to a ter.
    General Results.—It will be seen by an inspection of the <U+FB01>gures
that the general effect is a maximum contraction of the metal about
one inch above the water-line; and that this is the same whether the
metal be immersed one-half or two-thirds of its depth, or whether it
be nine, six, or three inches deep. With wrought iron the heatings
and coohngs could be repeated from <U+FB01>fteen to twenty times before
the metal showed any signs of separation; but with cast iron after
the <U+FB01>fth heating the metal was cracked, and the hollow cylinder
separated all round Just below the water-line after the second heating.
Cast steel stood twenty beatings, but was very much cracked all over
its surface.    As respects the change of form of cast iron and steel, the
result was similar to_ that in wrought iron,_but iiot nearly so_ large in
amount.      The cast iron did not return to its original dimensions, but
the smallest diameter was about one inch above the water-line.
    Tin showed no change of form, there being apparently no inter
mediate state between the melting-point_and absolute solidity. Brass,
gun-metal, and zinc showed the effect slightly; but instead of a con
traction Just above the water-line, there was an expansion _or bulging.
    The effect on wrought iron is best seen in the solid cylinder
(<U+FB01>gs. 9 and 10), where the displacement of particles just above the
water-line appears to be compensated by the biilgings at the two
extremities.
    The specimens of wrought iron were submitted by Mr. Abel (Che
mist to the War Department) to chemical analysis, and he informs
me that he found nothing noteworthy in the composition of the
metal; nor was there any appreciable di<U+FB01>erence in the speci<U+FB01>c
gravity of the metal taken from different parts of the specimen. It
appears therefore to be simply a movement of the particles whilst
the metal is in a soft or semi<U+FB02>uid state.
    The following is an account of the experiments, which were
carried out under the superiiitendence of Mr. Butter, Draughtsmau.

before and after heating are given in a tabulated form at the end of
the paper, to facilitate comparison.
   In <U+FB01>gs. 22 and 23 the changes in form of the 9" cylinders (one
immersed one-half, the other two-thirds its depth) are shown in

   Experiment. l—A 4 ft. 2 in. hoop-tire of 3 inches breadth and %-ths

to half its depth in cold water <U+FB01>ve times, by which the effect shown
in <U+FB01>g.- 2 was produced.

   The upper edge, or that cooled in air, had contracted 8 inches, or
<U+FB01>ljyth its entire length, and slightly increased in thickness ; while the
lower edge, cooled in water, had expanded ‘S75 inch, making a dif
ference between the two circumferences of 8875 inches. The breadth
remained unaltered (3 inches), and kept perfectly straight.

    Experiment 2.—Two hollow cylinders of wrought iron, 12 inches
diameter and 1:; inch thick each, and respectively 9 inches and 6 inches
deep, were heated to redness, and cooled by half-immersion in cold
water twenty times; for effects see <U+FB01>gs. 4 and 5.

                          One-eighth of full size.
    The 9-inch cylinder did not alter on the upper edge, cooled in air;
but the lower edge, cooled in water, contracted '6 inch, and the cir
cumference, at about one inch above the water-line, was reduced 5'5
inches; the internal surface had increased in depth -35 inch.
    The small cylinder diminished '7 inch on the upper edge, increased
'3 inch on the lower edge, and contracted 5-25 inches at about
1 inch above the water-line; the internal surface had increased in
depth '3 inch.
   Experiment 3.-—A cylinder of very thin wrought iron, so thin that
it could not be welded, and was therefore riveted, of the same external
dimensions as the 9-inch one of the foregoing experiment, was heated
to redness and cooled by half-immersion ten times, in order to test
the effect when the thickness of the metal was reduced as much as
possible.
   The upper and lower edges were not altered materially, while the
greatest contraction took place on the water-line, instead of 1 inch
above it as in the last experiment, and amounted to 3'5 inches. The
depth measured on the curve had increased '15 inch (see <U+FB01>g. 6).

those used in experiment 2, were heated and cooled byhbeing im
mersed to two-thirds their depth in water twenty times.
   The upper edge of the large cylinder was reduced 2'1 inches, and
the lower edge '9 inch ; it contracted 5-9 inches at about an inch above

(see <U+FB01>g. 7).
   The upper edge of the small cylinder was reduced in circumference
3'6 inches and the lower edge '65 inch, while the greatest contrac
tion at about one inch above the water-line was 4'6 inches; and the
internal surface had increased '15 inch in height (see <U+FB01>g. 8).
   Experiment 5.—A solid cylinder of wrought iron, 3 inches in dia
meter and 6 inches deep, was heated and cooled by being immersed
half its depth in water <U+FB01>fteen times.
   The greatest contraction took place a little .above the water-line
and on the lower edge, being in each case '45 inch; the upper edge
was reduced only '1 inch.
   A swell of metal took place on the two ends, but was greatest on
the bottom, or that cooled in water, being '15 inch in height.
   The <U+FB01>bre of the iron opened at the <U+FB01>fteenth cooling (see <U+FB01>g. 9).
   Experiment 6.—A wrought-iron cylinder exactly similar to the
last was cooled by being immersed to two-thirds its depth <U+FB01>fteen
times.
   The greatest contraction, amounting to '4 inch, took place a little
above the water-line; the upper edge was '05 inch smaller, and the
lower edge '35 inch, while the swellings on the ends were nearly the
same as in the last experiment (see <U+FB01>g. 10).
   The separation of the <U+FB01>bre took place at the <U+FB01>fteenth cooling.
   Ezzperiment 7.-—Two <U+FB02>at pieces of wrought iron, each 12 inches
long, 6 inches deep, and '5 inch thick, were heated and cooled twenty
times, one being immersed to half, and the other to two-thirds its
depth in water.
   That immersed one-half had contracted or become indented on the
ends fully '3 inch; the other had similar indentations, but to only
one-half the amount.     They were both turned up into the form of
an arc, had thickened on their upper edges, and increased '1 inch in
thicknesswhere thecontractionsontheendstook place(see <U+FB01>gs. 1 l & 12).

    Experiment 9.—A solid cast-steel cylinder, of the same dimensions
as that used in Experiment 5, was heated and cooled by half-immer
sion twenty times.
    The effect obtained was similar to that produced upon the solid
wrought-iron cylinders, but the breaking up of the structure was dif
ferent (see <U+FB01>g. 13). The greatest contraction was slightly above the
water-line, and amounted to '38 inch; the bulgings on the ends were
‘O75 inch, being much less than on the wrought-iron cylinders.
    Experiment 10.—A hollow brass cylinder, 6 inches long, 2 inches
in diameter, and -llgth of an inch thick, was heated to redness and
cooled by half-immersion thirty-four times.
    The effect produced was the opposite to that which took place with
the iron cylinders, being an expansion instead of a contraction at the
water-line, the amount of which was "175 inch, and it was also ex
panded on the lower edge '1 inch (see <U+FB01>g. 16).
    Experiment l1.——A hollow gun-metal cylinder was heated to red
ness and cooled twenty times by half-immersion.
    The thickness of metal being greater than in the last experiment,
the effect at the water-line was much less, but the lower edge had
expanded '1 inch. It began to crack all over at the last cooling.
    Experiment 12.—A hollow tin cylinder was heated in lineed-oil
which was brought to a temperature of 400° Fahr.; it was cooled by
half-immersion in water <U+FB01>ve times.                                     '
    The form was not altered in the least, though the heat was raised
in the last instance to the melting-point, as shown by the lower part
of the cylinder beginning to melt.
    Experiment l3.—A hollow zinc cylinder was heated and cooled by
half-immersion <U+FB01>fty times.                                       .
    It was heated in a wood furnace, the degree of heat to which it
was found each time to have increased in weight up to the tenth heating, at which
point it weighed 50 lbs. l'l25 oz., 01' 2'62?) ozs. heavier than it was at the com
mencement ; from the tenth to the <U+FB01>fteenth heating the accumulated scales peeled
off, and the weight was gradually reduced to that stated above.
   That which was cooled in water weighed 50 lbs. 12".’: ozs. before the experiment,
and 48 lbs. l4'5 ozs. at its conclusion, givinga loss of 1 lb. 14 ozs., which was
due to the action of the water peeling 011' the scale each time the cylinder was
cooled.

experiments with pieces of tin and zinc had been previously made,
by means of which it was ascertained that in the same temperature
tin melted in two-sevenths of the time requisite to melt zinc; hence
when the zinc cylinder and piece of tin were placed in the furnace
together, the time occupied by the tin in reaching its melting-point
was carefully noted, and the cylinder was left in the furnace as long
 again as the time thus observed; by this means it was brought very
 nearly to its melting-point without incurring any danger of its actually
 melting.    The last <U+FB01>ve times, however, it was allowed to remain a
 little longer in the <U+FB02>ame; and the melting upon the top was re
 tarded the last four times by placing a piece of iron upon it, which
 conducted heat from that part, allowing it to remain half a minute
 longer in the furnace.
    The effect obtained was the same as that produced upon the brass
 cylinder (Exp. 10), or the opposite of what took place with iron; an
 expansion of '1 75 inch occurred upon the water-line, and of '1 15 inch
 upon the lower edge.
    Experiment l4.—The hollow wrought-iron cylinder was heated to
 redness and cooled by half-immersion on its side, instead of on its
 end as in other experiments, twenty times.

          '1‘ The ends became slightly rounded. Fig. 13.
          " At the last cooling the lower end of the cylinder began to crumble away in
      the water. Fig. 16.
         ° The expansion of the lower end may probably be due to the cracking of the
      metal, which was greatest at that part.

especially those relating to hollow cylinders of wrought iron, which
are very instructive.
    Imagine such a cylinder divided into two parts by a horizontal
plane at the water-line, and in this state immersed after heating.
The under part, being in contact with water, would rapidly cool and
contract, while the upper part would cool but slowly. Consequently
by the time the under part had pretty well cooled, the upper part
would be left jutting out; but when both parts had cooled, their
diameters would again agree. Now in the actual experiment this
independent motion of the two parts is impossible, on account of the
 continuity of the metal; the under part tends to pull in the upper,
 and the upper to pull out the under. In this contest the cooler
 metal, being the stronger, prevails, and so the upper part gets pulled
 in, a little above the water-line, while still hot.   But it has still to
 contract on cooling; and this it will do to the full extent due to its
 temperature, except in so far as it may be prevented by its connexion
 with the rest.     Hence, on the whole, the effect of this cause is to
 leave a permanent contraction a little above the water-line; and it is
 easy to see that the contraction must be so much nearer to the water
 line as the thickness of the metal is less, the other dimensions of the
 hollow cylinder and the nature of the metal being given. When the
 hollow cylinder is very short, so as to be reduced to a mere hoop,
 the same cause operates; but there is not room for more than a
 general inclination of the surface, leaving the hoop bevelled.
    But there is another cause of deformation at work, the opera
 tion of which is well seen in <U+FB01>gs. 2 and 3. Imagine a mass of
 metal heated so as to be slightly plastic, and then rapidly cooled
 over a large part of its surface. In cooling, the skin at the same
 time contracts and becomes stronger, and thereby tends to squeeze
 out its contents. This accounts for the bulging of the ends of the
 solid cylinders of wrought iron and the rents seen in their cylindrical
 surface. The skin at the bottom is of course as strong as at the
 sides in the part below the water-line; but a surface which resists
 extension far more than bending has far less power to resist pressure
 of the nature of a <U+FB02>uid pressure when plane than when convex. The
 effect of the cause <U+FB01>rst explained is also manifest in these cylinders,
 although it is less marked than in the case of the hollow cylinders,
 as might have been expected.
    The tendency of the cooled skin of a heated metallic mass to
 squeeze out its contents appears to be what gives rise to the bulging
 seen near the water-line in the hollow cylinder of brass. Wrought
 iron, being highly tenacious even at a comparatively high tempera
 ture, resists with great force the sliding motion of the particles which
 must take place in order that the tendency of the cooled skin to
 squeeze out its contents may take e<U+FB02>'ect; but brass, approaching in
 its hotter parts more nearly to the state of a molten mass, exhibits
 the effect more strongly. It seems probable that even in the case of
 brass a very thin hollow cylinder would exhibit a contraction just
 above the water-line. Should there be a metal or alloy which about
 the temperatures with which we have to deal was stronger hot than
 cold, the e<U+FB02>"ect of the cause <U+FB01>rst referred to would be to produce an
 expansion a little below the water-line.--G. G. S.]

          son 1862, PART 1.*         BY s. M. nnacn, F.R..A.S.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
IN Mr. B. Gompertz’s paper “On the Science connected with
      Human Mortality," the learned and venerable author proposes,
in p. 519, the new foot index of crosier shape as indicating a common
or hyperbolic logarithm, or their antilogarithms, instead of the usual
exponential bases e and 1:. The four positions of this mark '— having
each a separate meaning, which might be mistaken by an error of
the writer or printer, and as its attachment to a binomial or multino
mial would be attended with some indistinctness, I beg to propose the
following logarithmic mark, viz. _j before the quantity of which the
logarithm is wanted, and 1 before the quantity (a logarithmic one)
of which the natural number is required. Whether the Briggean
0rJ\lapierian log is wanted may be indicated by a pre<U+FB01>xed b or n;
and the following synopsis will give an idea of the powers of my
notation.
   b‘_| a = (com. log. of a) raised to the ith power.
   b__l a": com. log. of (a‘)=i (b_| a).
   b"I a = ith power of number whose common log is a.
   b‘! a‘= number whose common log is a".
   n‘_l a = (nat. log of a) raised to the ith power.
   n_[ a"; nq a; n'] a"; similar to b, changing “common log"
      to “ natural log.”
   Hence we may combine n"_| bl] a=kth power of nat. log of a
number N, which N=ith power of com. log of a natural number a.
We might further apply _] to sines, &c., sin"__| 0=ith power of sin 6,
cos"_] sin"6=lcth power of cosine of an are = a number N, which N
is (sin 6)‘ ; similarly tan"‘_| sin"6=mth power of tangent of an arc
=N; sin_| 0‘=n"_| a= sin of (arc 6)"=kth power of nat. log of a
nat. number a, &c.
   Thus to the recognized > <___L || , the symbols 1 _] might <U+FB01>tly
be added. Mr. Gompertz’s embodiment of zeros is quite a boon. He
puts -00000000"/es =.7ss, and s960o0o0=s9s@ ; the former
shows that 7 is preceded by eight decimal zeros, the latter that 6 is
followed by <U+FB01>ve zeros before the decimal point. This suggestion is
particularly valuable in large and approximate results, as the number
of vibrations of a light-ray in an inch, the English mile radius vector
of a planet from the sun, the English mile distance of a <U+FB01>xed star,
parallax =1”, which is 206000 times 95 millions of miles =l957
miles in Mr. Gompertz’s notation.         There are two errata (p. 517.
line 26, for L,,,+,, read L,,,+2,,; and p. 543-4, for 2° read S10) that
may be pointed out.

   In Mr. A. Cohen's paper, p. 470, I fear that the author’s “ com
plete sum ” will rather confuse terms. His A B is the “ complete
sum of O A and O B,” while it is really less than either; and the
angular opening of OA and O B is totally disregarded, the paren
thesized (O A) and (O B) being a questionable caution-mark.
   It is much to be deplored that Mr. John Long’s mode of raising
logarithms (Phil. Trans. 1714, ‘Hutton’s Tracts ’) has not been
generally adopted for teaching in schools. It rests simply on arith
metical notions of progression. Thus log l0=l, log l00=2; let
N=A.B.C.D.E.F.G, &c., and log A=%, log B=l_g_0.,
             0
log C= M, &c., so that with his Table of the 10th, 100th, 1000th
parts of 10, we <U+FB01>nd 10°-"=A,N+A=B C D,&c. Tabular 10°'°b=B;
B . G . D, &c.—I-B=C . D . E, &c., and thus we <U+FB01>nally get
                    'a+ ‘Ob + 'O00c+'000d, &c.=log N
without any previous algebraic knowledge being required. In countries
where the decimal division of coins, weights, and measures is in
use, this popular mode of teaching logarithms ought surely to be
a branch of primary education, as much as exchanges, equation of
payments, &c.

  on A PARTICULAR case or run FORMATION or SOAP-BUBBLES.
                         BY M. riénrx rrnvraao.
    Being merely a student of the Faculty of Sciences, I should have
 thought it premature to submit to the Academy the results of an
 observation to which chance alone had led me; but I have yielded
 to the pressing wish of my father, who <U+FB01>nds the observation curious
 in itself, and important in its bearings on a meteorological question.
    I was emptying a dish containing some waste liquor which had
 been used for cleaning metal plates, and I tried by darting it obliquely
 in the air to spread it out as a sheet. I obtained a sheet, in fact, but
 I was surprised to see it change into a bubble of 8 to 9 centims. in
 diameter.                             _
    I repeated the experiment several times, simply using soap-water,
 and I soon succeeded in producing the e<U+FB01>'ect with certainty; but
 almost always several bubbles were formed, sometimes as many as
 <U+FB01>fteen. Their diameter, which might reach 8 to 9 centims. in the
largest, was less as they were more numerous.
    The conditions which appeared the best are as follows. A dish is
 taken about 15 centims. in diameter; success may be obtained,
 though less certainly, with vessels of other shapes and different
 dimensions. There ought to be a large quantity of liquid; it is pro
 jected at an angle of about 45 degrees, being turned rapidly on itself,
 so as to produce the most extended surface possible.        The liquid
 which gave me the best results is a solution of 1 part of Marseilles
 soap in 40 parts of water. In order the better to make out the mode
 in which the phenomenon takes place, I observed it from an upper

.408            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 window, while another person below made the experiment as I have
 indicated.
    I thus observed that the liquid sheet, of a very irregular form and
 indented on the edges, separates at its edges into numerous solid
 drops, while the remainder is torn generally into several portions,
 each of which rapidly closes so as to form a complete hollow bubble.
    My father sees in this phenomenon an argument in support of the
 vesicular state of the vapour of clouds. In fact one of the principal
 objections against this hypothesis consists in the impossibility of
 conceiving how the molecules of gaseous vapour could, when this
 repasses into the liquid state, agglomerate so as to constitute enve
 loo); enclosing air; but we see now that this immediate agglomera
 F‘; 4lZO closed envelopes is not necessary ; it is su<U+FB01>icient that the
  “ .ecules unite in open plates of any shape and curvature; each of
 ...ese plates would then quickly close of itself and give rise to a vesi
 cule. Doubtless the production of these plates is not easy to under
 stand, but it appeared at least much more admissible than the forma
 tion, complete in all respects, of the vesicules.—-Bulletin de l’A cadémie

               LX. On the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
         By THOMAS Gaarmm, F.R.S., Master of the Mint*.
THE molecular mobility of gases will be considered at present
        chie<U+FB02>y in reference to the passage of gases, under pressure,
through a thin porous plate or septum, and to the partial sepa
ration of mixed gases which can be effected, as will be shown, by
such means. The investigation arose out of a renewed and
somewhat protracted inquiry regarding the di<U+FB01>usion of gases
(which depends upon the same molecular mobility), and has
a<U+FB01>brded certain new results which may prove to be of interest in
a theoretical as well as in a practical point of view.
    In the Diifusiometer, as <U+FB01>rst constructed, a plain cylindrical
glass tube, about 10 inches in length and rather less than an
inch in diameter, was simply closed at one end by a porous plate
of plaster of Paris, about one-thi1'd of an inch in thickness, and
was thus converted into a gas-receiver1'. A superior material
for the porous plate has since been found in the arti<U+FB01>cially com
pressed graphite of Mr. Brockedon, of the quality used for
making writing-pencils. This material is sold in London in
small cubic masses about 2 inches square. A cube may
easily be cut into slices of a millimetre or two in thickness by
means of a saw of steel spring. By rubbing the surface of the
slice without wetting it upon a <U+FB01>at sand-stone, the thickness
may be further reduced to about one-half of a millimetre. A

  The whole hydrogen will leave the
  tube in forty minutes or an hour, and
  is replaced by a much smaller pro
   portion of atmospheric air (about                        m|||m|m|

   from the law of the diffusion of gases.
   During the process, the mercury will
   rise in the tube, if allowed, forming
   a column of several inches in height’
   —a fact which illustrates strikingly
  the intensity of the force with which the interpenetration of differ
   ent gases is effected. Native graphite is of a lamellar structure,
   and appears to have little or no porosity. It cannot be substi
   tuted for the arti<U+FB01>cial graphite as a di<U+FB02>"usion-septum. Unglazed
  earthenware comes next in value to graphite for that purpose.
      The pores of arti<U+FB01>cial graphite appear to be really so minute,
  that a gas in mass cannot penetrate the plate at all. It seems
  that molecules only can pass; and they may be supposed to
  pass wholly unimpeded by friction, for the smallest pores that
  can be imagined to exist in the graphite must be tunnels in
 .magnitude to the ultimate atoms of a gaseous body. The sole
  motive agency appears to be that intestine movement of mole
  cules which is now generally recognized as an essential property
  of the gaseous condition of matter.
      According to the physical hypothesis now generally received*,
  a gas is represented as consisting of solid and perfectly elastic
  spherical particles 01' atoms, which move in all directions, and are
     * D. Bernoulli, J. Herapath, Joule, Kriinig, Clausius, Clerk Maxwell,
  and Cazin. The merit of reviving this hypothesis in recent times and <U+FB01>rst
  applying it to the facts of gaseous di<U+FB01>iision. is fairly due to Mr. Herapatli.

        Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.         411
animated with different degrees of velocity in di<U+FB02>'erent gases.
Con<U+FB01>ned in a vessel the moving particles are constantly impin
ging against its sides and occasionally against each other, and
this contact takes place without any loss of motion, owing to the
perfect elasticity of the particles. If the containing vessel be
porous, like a dilfusiometer, then gas is projected through the
open channels, by the atomic motion described, and escapes.
Simultaneously the external air is carried inwards in the same
manner, and takes the place of the gas which leaves the vessel.
To this atomic or molecular movement is due the elastic force,
with the power to resist compression, possessed by gases. The
molecular movement is accelerated by heat and retarded by cold,
the tension of the gas being increased in the <U+FB01>rst instance and
diminished in the second. Even when the same gas is present both
within and without the vessel, or is in contact with both sides of
our porous plate, the movement is sustained without abatement-—
molecules continuing to enter and to leave the vessel in equal
number, although nothing of the kind is indicated by ‘a change
of volume or otherwise. If the gases in communication be dif
ferent but possess sensibly the same speci<U+FB01>c gravity and mole
cular velocity, as nitrogen and carbonic oxide do, an interchange
of molecules also takes place without any change in volume.
\Vith gases opposed of unequal density and molecular velocity,
the permeation ceases of course to be equal in both directions.
   These observations are preliminary to the consideration of the
passage through a graphite plate, in one direction only, of gas
under pressure, or under the in<U+FB02>uence of its own elastic force.
We are to suppose a vacuum to be maintained on one side of the
porous septum, and air or any other gas, under a constant pres
sure, to be in contact with the other side. Now a gas may pass
into a vacuum in three different modes, or in two other modes
besides that immediately before us.
   1. The gas may enter the vacuum by passing through a
minute aperture in a thin plate, such as a puncture in platinum
foil made by a <U+FB01>ne steel point. The rate of passage of different
gases is then regulated by their speci<U+FB01>c gravities, according to a
pneumatic law which was deduced by Professor John Robison
from T0rricelli’s well-known theorem of the velocity of e<U+FB01>iux of
<U+FB02>uids. A gas rushes into a vacuum with the velocity which a
heavy body would acquire by falling from the height of an atmo
sphere composed of the gas in question, and supposed to be of
uniform density throughout. The height of the uniform atmo
sphere would be inversely as the density of the gas, the atmo
sphere of hydrogen, for instance, sixteen times higher than that
of oxygen. But as the velocity acquired by a heavy body in
falling is not directly as the height, but as the square root of the
                              2E 2

412      Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
height, the rate of <U+FB02>ow of different gases into a vacuum will be
inversely as the square root of their respective densities. The
velocity of oxygen being 1, that of hydrogen will be 4-, the
square root of 16. This law has been experimentally veri<U+FB01>ed*.
The relative times of the e<U+FB01>'usion of gases, as I have spoken of
it, are similar to those of molecular diffusion ; but it is important
to observe that the phenomena of eifusion and diffusion are dis
tinct and essentially di<U+FB02>erent in their nature. The effusion
movement affects masses of gas, the di<U+FB02>'usion movement affects
molecules; and a gas is usually carried by the former kind of
impulse with a velocity many thousand times as great as is
demonstrable by the latter.
     2. If the aperture of e<U+FB02>iux be in a plate of increased thick
ness, and so becomes a tube, the effusion-rates are disturbed.
The rates of <U+FB02>ow of di<U+FB02>erent gases, however, assume again a
constant ratio to each other when the capillary tube is consider
ably elongated, when the length exceeds the diameter by at least
4000 times. These new proportions of e<U+FB02>iux are the rates of
the “ Capillary Transpiration ” of gases'|‘. The rates are found
to be the same in a capillary tube composed of copper as they
are in glass, and appear to be independent of the material of the
capillary. A <U+FB01>lm of gas no doubt adheres to the surface of the
tube, and the friction is really that of gas upon gas, and is con
sequently una<U+FB02>ectcd by the tube-substance. The rates of trans
piration are not governed by speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and are indeed
singularly unlike the rates of effusion.
    The transpiration-velocity of oxygen being 1, that of chlorine
is 1'5, that of hydrogen 2'26, of ether vapour the same or nearly
the same as that of hydrogen, of nitrogen and carbonic oxide half
that of hydrogen, of ole<U+FB01>ant gas, ammonia, and cyanogen 2
(double or nearly double that of oxygen), of carbonic acid 1376,
and of the gas of marshes l'815. In the same gas the velocity
of transpiration increases with increased density, whether occa
sioned by cold or pressure.
     The transpiration-ratios of gases appear to be in direct rela
tion with no other known property of the same gases, and they
form a class of phenomena remarkably isolated from all else at
present known of gases.
     There is one property of transpiration immediately bearing
upon permeation of the graphite plate by gases. The capillary
offers to the passage of gas a resistance analogous to that of
friction, proportional to the surface, and consequently increasing
as the tube or tubes are multiplied in number and diminished in
diameter, with the area of discharge preserved constant. The

          Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.          413
 resistance to the passage of liquid through a capillary was ob
 served by Poiseuille to be nearly as the fourth power of the dia
  meter of the tube. In gases the reistance also rapidly increases;
  but in what ratio, has not been observed. The consequence,
  however, is certain, that as the diameter of the capillaries may
  be diminished beyond any assignable limit, so the <U+FB02>ow ma be
  retarded inde<U+FB01>nitely, and caused at last to become too sma 1 to
  be sensible. VVe may then have a mass of capillaries of which
  the passages form a large aggregate, but are individually too
  small to allow a sensible <U+FB02>ow of gas under pressure. A porous
  solid mass may possess the same reduced permeability as the
  congeries of capillary tubes. Indeed the state of porosity de
  scribed appears to be more or less closely approached by all loosely
  aggregated mineral masses, such as lime-plaster, stucco, chalk,
_ baked clay, non-crystalline earthy powders like hydrate of lime
   or magnesia compacted by pressure, and in the highest degree
   perhaps by arti<U+FB01>cial graphite.
      3. A plate of arti<U+FB01>cial graphite, although it appears to be
   practically impermeable to gas by either of the two modes of
  passage previously described, is readily penetrated by the agency
   of the molecular or diffusive movement of gases. This appears
   on comparing the time required for the passage through the
   plate of equal volumes of different gases under a constant pres
   sure. Of the three gases, oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid,
   the time required for the passage of an equal volume of each
   through a capillary glass tube, in similar circumstances as to
   pressure and temperature, was formerly observed to be as fol
   lows :
                                     Time of capillary transpiration
                                          of equal volumes.

      Now through a plate of graphite, half a millimetre in thick
   ness, the same gases were observed to pass, under a constant
   pressure of a column of mercury of 100 millims. in height, in
   times which are as follows :—
                          Time of molecular     Square root of density

      It appears that the times of passage through the graphite
   plate have no relation to the capillary transpiration-times of the
    same gases as <U+FB01>rst quoted. The new times in question, how

414     Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
ever, show a close relation to the square roots of the densities of
the respective gases, as is seen in the last Table; and they so far
agree with theoretical times of diffusion usually ascribed to the
same gases.
   These results were obtained by means of the graphite diffusio
meter already referred to, which was a plain glass tube about
22 millims. in diameter, closed at one end by the graphite
plate. In order to conduct gas to the upper surface of the
graphite plate, a little chamber was formed above the plate, to
which the gas was conveyed in a moderate stream by the entrance
tube e (<U+FB01>g. 3) ,- while the gas brought in excess was constantly
escaping into
the air_by the
open     issue
tube 2'. The
chamber was
formed of a short piece of
glass tube, about 2 inches in
length, cemented over the
upper end of the diffusio
meter. The upper opening
of this short tube was closed
by a cork perforated for the
entrance- and exit-tubes. It
will be observed that by this
arrangement the upper sur
face of the graphite plate was
constantly swept by a stream
of gas, which was under no
additional pressure beyond
that of the atmosphere, a free
escape being allowed by the
exit-tube. The gas also was
always dried before reaching
the chamber. The di<U+FB01>'usio
meter stood over mercury,
and was raised or lo\vered by
the lever movement intro
duced by Professor Bunsen
in his very exact experiments
upon gaseous di<U+FB01>'usi0n*. To
obtain the pressure of 100
millims. of mercury, the dif-               E      ‘

  raised in the trough. Gas gradually entered till the column of
  mercury in the tube fell to 100 millims. The mercury was then
  maintained at this height, by gradually raising the tube in pro
  portion as gas continued to enter and the mercury to‘ fall, so as
  to maintain a constant difference of level of 100 millims., as
  observed by the graduation inscribed upon the tube itself, between
  the level of the mercury in the tube and trough. The experi
  ment consisted in observing the time in seconds which the mer
  cury took to fall 10 millimetre divisions with each gas. The
  constant volume of gas which entered was 2'2 cubic centims.
  (0'1-'54:? cubic inch). Two experiments were made with each gas.
     Oxygen entered in 898 and 894 seconds; mean 896 seconds.
      Hydrogen in 222 and 221 seconds; mean 221'5 seconds.
     Carbonic acid in 1070 and 1060 seconds ; mean 1065 seconds.
     In such experiments the same gas exists on both sides, and
  also occupies the pores of the diaphragm. But the molecular
  movement within the pores in a downward direction is not fully
  balanced by the molecular movement in an upward direction,
  owing to the less tension, by 100 millims., of the gas below the
  diaphragm and within the tube than the gas above and with
  out. The in<U+FB02>ux of gas indicates the difference of molecular
  movement in opposite directions. Taking the full tension of
  the gas above the diaphragm at 760 millims., that below would
  be 660 millims., and the movement downwards and that upwards
  are represented by these numbers respectively.
     To increase the inequality of tension and favour the passage
  of gas through the graphite plate, a di<U+FB01>usion-tube was now used,
  48 inches in length, or of the dimensions of a barometer-tube,
  by which a Torricellian vacuum could he commanded. The
  pneumatic trough in which this gas-tube was suspended con
‘ sisted of a pipe of gutta percha of equal length, closed at the
  bottom by a cork, and widening into a funnel-form at the top.
  In one modi<U+FB01>cation of the instrument it was found convenient
  to cement a capillary glass tube to the side of the glass diffusio
  meter, within about l5 millims. of the upper end of the tube.
  An opening into the upper part of the glass tube was thus ob
  tained, by means of which the gas contained in the dilfusiometer
  could escape when the latter was depressed in the mercurial
  trough. A <U+FB02>exible tube with clip was attached to the capillary .
  tube referred to, so that the latter could be closed. From the
  same opening a specimen of the gas contained in the diffusio
  meter could be drawn when required for examination.
      In another and more serviceable modi<U+FB01>cation of this barome
  trical di<U+FB01>usiometer a large space was obtained above the mercu
  rial column, by surmounting the long glass tube, unprovided

with a graphite plate, by a glass jar about half a litre in capacity.
This jar was more correctly as small bell-jar (<U+FB01>g. 4) open at top.
It was <U+FB01>tted in an inverted position, as in <U+FB01>g. 5, to the open end
of the long glass tube d, by means of a cork and cement. The
     Fig. 4.                                  Fig. 6.
large upper opening was closed by a circular plate of gutta percha
 (<U+FB01>g. 5), about 10 millims., or nearly half an inch, in thickness.
This disc of gutta percha had two perforations, at f and g (<U+FB01>g. 6),
the former of which was <U+FB01>tted above with a wide glass tube.
The tube f was closed below by the plate of graphite, and above
with a perforated cork carrying a quill tube, e. This quill tube
was the entrance-tube for gas, and was accompanied by the usual
issue-tube, i. The other aperture in the gutta-percha cover was
<U+FB01>tted with a plain quill tube, h, which did not descend below
the level of the gutta percha, and formed a tube of exit. No
difficulty was found in making all these junctions air-tight, by
applying the heated blade of a knife to fuse the gutta percha in
contact with the glass. Gutta percha is indeed of no ordinary
value in the construction of pneumatic apparatus. The graphite
plate itself required to be not less than 1 millim. in thickness,
in order to support the pressure of awhole atmosphere, to which
it is exposed in the present apparatus. This barometrical dif
fusiometer is supported from above by a cord passing over a
pulley, and is duly counterpoised by a hanging weight.
   In operating, the <U+FB01>rst point is to expel the air from the baro
meter-tube and upper chamber. The instrument (<U+FB01>g. 7) is sunk
completely in the mercurial trough previously described, till the

whole is <U+FB01>lled, and mer      Fig. 7.
cury enters the quill tube
of exit, /1. The caoutchouc
extension of this tube is
then closed by a pinch.
The diffusiometer is now
elevated 30 or 40 inches,
when the mercury sinks
in the glass tube till it
comes to stand at the baro
metric height for the time,
leaving the upper chamber
entirely vacuous. The gas
to be tried has in the mean
time been made to stream
over the upper surface of
the graphite plate, exactly
as in the experiment with
the former diifusiometer.
The graphite is permeated
by the gas, and the mer
cury in the di<U+FB01>'usiometer
tube begins to fall, but it
now falls slowly, owing to
the considerable vacuous
space to be <U+FB01>lled. It is
allowed to fall about half
an inch, and the exact time
is then noted, by a watch,
when the mercury passes
a certain point in the
graduation of the tube,
and again when the mer
cury descends to another
<U+FB01>xed point an inch or two
below the former. The
time of permeation of a
certain volume of gas is
thus ascertainedin seconds.
The experiment is imme
diatelyrepeatedwith two or
more gases in succession,in
similar circumstances as to
pressureandwith greatcare
taken to ensure uniformity
of temperature during the
whole period.

  418    Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
      In a series of four experiments made with hydrogen, the
  mercury fell from 758 to 685 millims. (29'9 inches to 27 inches)
  in 252, 256, 254, and 256 seconds; mean 254'5 seconds.
      In three experiments with oxygen the mercury fell through
  the same space in 1019, 1025, and 1024 seconds; mean 1022"?
  seconds:
                             1022'7
                             2546 -4 018.
      The times of these gases appear therefore to be as 1 to 4018,
  while the times calculated as being inversely as the square root
  of the densities of the same gases are as 1 to 4.
      On another day, with a different height of the barometer, four
  gases were passed through the graphite plate in succession
  through a somewhat shorter range, namely, from 754 to 685
  millims. (297 to 27 inches).
      The time of permeation of air was 884 and 885 seconds;
  mean 8845 seconds.
      The time of carbonic acid was 1100 and 1106 seconds; mean
‘ 1103 seconds.
      The time of oxygen was 936, 924, and 930 seconds; mean
  930 seconds.
    ' The time of hydrogen was 229, 235, and 235 seconds ; mean
  233 seconds.
      These times of permeation are in the following proportion :—
                                 Times of the permeation of equal
                                  volumes of gas through graphite.

                   Hydrogen . . . . . O'2505
      These numbers approach so closely to the square roots of the
  density, or the theoretical diffusion-times of the same gases,
  namely, oxygen 1, air O'9507, carbonic acid 1'176, and hy
  drogen O'2502, that they may be held to indicate the prevalence
  of a common law. They exclude the idea of capillary transpi
  ration, which gives to the same gases entirely different numbers.
      The movement of gases through the graphite plate appears
  to be solely due to their own proper molecular motion, quite
  unaided by transpiration. It seems to be the simplest possible
  exhibition of the molecular or di<U+FB02>'usive movement of gases.      This
  pure result is to be ascribed to the wonderfully <U+FB01>ne (minute)
  porosity of the graphite.    The interstitial spaces appear to be
  su<U+FB01>iciently small to extinguish capillary transpiration entirely.
  The graphite plate is a pneumatic sieve which stops all gaseous
  matter in mass, and permits molecules only to pass.

        Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.        419
    It is worth observing what result a plate of more open struc
ture, such as stucco, will give in comparison with graphite. For
the graphite plate, a cylinder of stucco, 12 millims. in thickness,
was accordingly substituted, and gas allowed to percolate at both
low and high pressures, as in the former experiments with
graphite.
    1. Under a constant pressure of 100 millims. of mercury,
gas was allowed to enter through 100 millim. divisions of the
diffusiometer.
    With air, the time in two experiments was 515, and again
515 seconds.
    With hydrogen 178 seconds, and again 178 seconds:
                         515
                         m =2 894.
    2. Under a pressure beginning with 710 millims. (28 inches)
and ending with 660 millims. (26 inches), the time with air was
374 and 375 seconds; mean 374.<'5 seconds.           The time with
hydrogen was 129 and 130 seconds; mean 129‘5 seconds:
                         374'5
                          1295 - 2 891.
    The stucco cylinder of the preceding experiments had been
dried over sulphuric acid, without the application of heat. It
was further desiccated at 60° C. for twenty-four hours, in order
to <U+FB01>nd whether the porosity would be altered. The ratio of the
time of hydrogen to that of air now became 1 to 2-788 at the
lower degree of pressure, and 1 to 2744 at the higher degree of
pressure.
    It will be observed that the theoretical diffusion-ratio of
 hydrogen to air, which is 1 to 3'80, is greatly departed from in
 these experiments with stucco. The ratio appears to be tending
 to the proportion of the transpiration-times of the same gases,
 namely, 1 to 2'04. In an experiment recorded by Bunsen, the
 ratio observed between the times of hydrogen and oxygen in
 passing, under a small degree of pressure, through stucco dried
 by heat was so low as 1 to 2'73, the stucco being probably less
 dense than in the experiments before us.
    With stucco the permeation of gases under pressure appears to
 be a mixed phenomenon—to some extent molecular diffusion into
 a vacuum, such as holds with the plate of graphite, but princi
pally capillary transpiration of gas in mass.
    The diifusiometer was now closed by a plate of white biscuit
 ware, 2'2 millims. in thickness.    The time of fall at the constant
 pressure of 100 millims., through a range of forty divisions of

   The stoneware was evidently of a much closer texture than
stucco, and the ratio appears again less in<U+FB02>uenced by capillary
transpiration. In fact the molecular ratio of 1 to 3'80 is ap
proached within 1 per cent. Biscuitware therefore appears to
be but little inferior to graphite for such experiments, a circum
stance which is important, as the latter is not easily procured
and cannot be converted into tubes and other convenient forms
like plastic clay.
   Further, the rate of passage of gas through the plate of gra
phite appears to be closely proportional to the pressure. The
resistance was increased by augmenting the thickness of the
plate to 2 millims. ; and with air and hydrogen at a pressure
maintained constant at 50 and 100 millims., the time was ob
served that the gas took to enter 10 linear millimetre divisions
of the tube.

   By halving the pressure, the time of passage is doubled, or
increased somewhat more. Greater pressures might probably
give a rate of passage corresponding more exactly with the
pressure.
   The ratio between the comparative times of the two gases in
the last experiments may also be noticed, the observations having
been made in similar circumstances as to pressure and tempe
rature.

   The velocity of hydrogen appears, as usual, to be nearly 3'8
times that of air ;
                     W(X15926 =3-7994..
   An experiment was made at the same time as the former series
upon a mixture of 95 hydrogen and 5 air, which gave an un
looked-for result that led to a great deal of inquiry. It is known
that such a mixture is effused through an aperture in a <U+FB01>ne plate
in a time which is as the square root of the density of the mix
ture, and therefore nearly the arithmetical mean of the two gases
effused separately. But in transpiration by a capillary, a mix
ture of 95 hydrogen and 5 air requires a considerably longer
time than the gases transpired separately. In fact 5 per cent.
of air retards the transpiration of hydrogen nearly as much as
20 per. cent. of air would retard the eifusion of hydrogen*. Now
the mixture in question permeates the graphite plate in 527'5
seconds, while the calculated mean of the times of the two gases
is 562'1 seconds.
    The mixture has therefore passed neither in the e<U+FB01>'usion time,
nor in a longer time as it would do by capillary transpiration,
but, singular to say, in a time considerably shorter than either.
The gas that came through was found by analysis to be altered
in composition. It contained more hydrogen and less air than
the original mixture. Hence it passed through with increased
rapidity. On consideration it appeared that such a separation
of the mixed gases must follow as a consequence of the movement
being molecular. Each gas is impelled by its own peculiar mo
lecular force, which, as has been seen, is capable of causing
hydrogen to permeate the graphite plate about 3'8 times as
rapidly as air.
    Each gas may permeate a graphite plate into a vacuum with
 the same relative velocity as it diffuses into another gaseous
 atmosphere, but it remains a question whether the velocities of
permeation and diifusion are absolutely as well as relatively the
 same. To illustrate this point, hydrogen and air were <U+FB01>rst
allowed to permeate into a vacuum, and then to diffuse into each
 other, through the same graphite plate, which was 1 millim. in
 thickness. The plate was a circular disc of 22 millims. in
 diameter.

  The volume of gas which produced this effect was found by the
  calibration of the tube to be 8'85 cub. centims. Hence 1'22 cub.
  centim. of the hydrogen entered the diifusiometer in 60 seconds,
  or one minute. But the pressure under which the hydrogen
  gas entered was the mean of 762 to 685 millims., or 723'5
  millims. ; while a whole atmosphere (the height of the barometer
  at the time) was 765 millims. The volume of the gas has there
  fore to be increased as 7235 to 765 to give the full action of a
  vacuum. The volume becomes 1'289 cub. centim. in one minute.
     When the diffusiometer was <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen and the gas
  allowed to diffuse into air, the rise ‘of the mercury was pretty
  uniform for the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve minutes, being 155 millim. divisions
  in the <U+FB01>rst two minutes, 7 in the third minute, 7'5 in the fourth
  minute, and 7 in the <U+FB01>fth minute, making 37 divisions in <U+FB01>ve
  minutes. But as in diffusion 1 air may be supposed to enter
  the tube for 3'8 hydrogen which escape, the hydrogen which
                                                1
. diffused was more than 37 divisions, by as, that is, by about
  10 divisions.     Hence 4/7 divisions of hydrogen have diffused
  into air in <U+FB01>ve minutes.     These divisions measured, by the cali
  bration of the tube, 6'2l5 cub. centims. One-<U+FB01>fth of this amount,
  that is, 1'24?» cub. centim., diffused in one minute. The result of
  the whole is that in one minute there passed of hydrogen
  through the graphite plate,
           l'289 cub. centim. by permeation into a vacuum,
           1243 cub. centim. by diffusion into air.
     The numbers indicate a close approach to equality in the
  velocities of permeation into a vacuum and of diffusion into an
  other gas, through the same porous diaphragm. The ditfusion
  appears the slower of the two by a small amount ; but this is as it
  should be, our estimate of the diffusion-velocity being certainly
  underrated; for the initial diffusion, or even the diffusion in
  the <U+FB01>rst minute, must obviously be somewhat greater than the
  average of the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve minutes, which we have taken to repre
  sent it-—-the hydrogen necessarily diffusing out in a diminishing
  progression, or more slowly in proportion as air has entered the
  diifusiometer. It is strictly the initial velocity of diifusion (that
  of the <U+FB01>rst second if it could be obtained) that ought to be com
  pared with the percolation into a vacuum.
     In <U+FB01>ne, there can be little doubt left on the mind that the
  permeation through the graphite plate into a vacuum and the dif

      Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Zllobility of Gases.         423
fusion into a gaseous atmosphere, through the same plate, are
due to the same inherent mobility of the gaseous molecule.
They are the exhibition of this movement in different circum
stances. In interdiffusion we have two gases moved simulta
neously through the passages in opposite directions, each gas
under the in<U+FB02>uence of its own inherent force; while with gas on
one side of the plate and a vacuum on the other side, we have a
single gas moving in one direction only. The latter case may
be assimilated to the former if the vacuum be supposed to repre
sent an in<U+FB01>nitely light gas. It will not involve any error, there
fore, to speak of both movements as gaseous di<U+FB01>'usion,—the dif
fusion of gas into gas (double di<U+FB01>'usion) in one case, and the
diffusion of gas into a vacuum (single diffusion) in the other.
The inherent molecular mobility may also be justly spoken of as
the di<U+FB01>"usibility or diffusive force of gases.
   The diffusive mobility of the gaseous molecule is a property
of matter fundamental in its nature, and the source of many
others. The rate of ditfusibility of any gas has been said to be
regulated by its speci<U+FB01>c gravity, the velocity of diffusion having
been observed to vary inversely as the square root of the density
of the gas.    This is true, but not in the sense of‘the di<U+FB02>"usibility
being determined or caused by speci<U+FB01>c gravity. The physical
basis is the molecular mobility. The degree of motion which
the molecule possesses regulates the volume which the gas
assumes, and is obviously one, if not the only, determining
cause of the peculiar speci<U+FB01>c gravity which the gas enjoys. If
it were possible to increase in a permanent manner the molecular
motion of a gas, its speci<U+FB01>c gravity would be altered, and it
would become a lighter gas. With the density is also associated
the equivalent weight of a gaseous element, according to the
doctrine of equal combining volumes.

    Oxygen and Hydrogen.-—A diifusiometer of the same construc
tion as that described (<U+FB01>g. 3, p. 414), with a graphite plate of
 1 millim. in thickness, was now employed. The upper surface
of the plate was swept by a current of the mixed gas proceeding
from a gas-holder, the excess of gas being allowed to escape into
the atmosphere, as usual, by an open exit-tube. The gas was
drawn through the graphite by elevating the ditfusiometer con
taining a column of mercury, from its well, so as to command a
partial vacuum in the upper part of the tube. Care is taken
that any gas, left in the upper part of the diffusiometer-tube
before the experiment begins, should be of the same composi
tion as the gas to be allowed afterwards to enter, so that, on

  424      Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
  starting, the gas may be uniform in composition on both sides of
  the graphite plate. The height of the mercurial column, which
  measures the aspirating force of the diffusiometer, is preserved
 uniform by gradually raising the tube in the mercurial trough
 in proportion as gas enters and the mercury falls. The diffusio
 meter is suspended from the roof of the apartment by a cord pass
 ing over a pulley and properly weighted, as in former expe
 riments.
    The mixture to be diffused consisted of nearly equal volumes
 of oxygen and hydrogen. The effect of different degrees of
 pressure on the amount of separation produced was <U+FB01>rst observed.
 It will be seen that as the pressure or aspirating force is increased
 the amount of separation becomes greater. Barom. O'759millim.;

    In the last observation, or that with the greatest pressure
 (747 millims.), the oxygen is reduced to 228 per cent. and the
hydrogen increased to 77'2 per cent. of the diffused mixture,
 showing a considerable separation. The mixed gases appear to
 make their way through the graphite plate independently, each
following its own peculiar rate of diifusion.
    But it is only under the aspiration of a complete vacuum that
the separation can attain its maximum, and reach the full differ
ence that may exist between the special di<U+FB01>usibilities of the two
gases.     The reason is that while we have the original mixture
on both sides of the plate, and of equal tension, the gases are
not at rest, but diffusion is proceeding as actively through the
plate, in opposite directions, as if the gases were di<U+FB02>ierent or the
tension unequal on the two sides. This is a condition of the
molecular mobility of gases (p. 411). The tension therefore being
supposed to differ by 100 millims. only, as when the gas above
the plate was of 759 millims. tension, and below of 659 millims.
(in the <U+FB01>rst experiment of the last series), then 100 volumes
only out of 759 of the mixture are subject to separation. But
while these 100 volumes press through they are accompanied by
659 volumes of unchanged mixture. The latter 659 volumes

        Mr. T. Graham on Me Molecular Mobility of Gases.      425
are replaced by an equal bulk of unchanged mixture diffused
from below, so that the volumes are not disturbed by this por
tion of the molecular interchange.
   The amount of separation, then, attainable by transmitting a
mixed gas through a porous diaphragm by pressure will be in
proportion to the pressure—that is, to the inequality of tension
on different sides of the diaphragm.
    Oxygen and Nitragen.—The separation of the gases of the
atmosphere by transmission through the graphite plate has a
peculiar interest.
   In an experiment resembling those last decribed, atmospheric
air was swept over the upper surface of a graphite plate having
a thickness of 2 millims. The gas that penetrated into the
vacuum contained, as was to be expected, the lighter and more
diifusible constituent in excess. It gave by the pyrogallic acid
and potash process of Liebig,

                   Nitrogen. . . . . 80
This was an increase in the nitrogen of quite 1 per cent.; for
air, analysed for comparison at the same time and in the same
manner, gave oxygen 21'O3, and nitrogen 7897.
    It may be legitimately inferred from the last experiment, that
if pure hydrogen in a diifusiometer were allowed to di<U+FB01>hse into
the atmosphere through a porous plate, the portion of air which
then enters the diffusiometer should also have its composition
disturbed. A diffusion of hydrogen through a graphite plate
was interrupted before completion. The air which had entered
was found to consist of

The increase of nitrogen is 1'23 per cent.
    While the nitrogen is increased and the oxygen diminished in
the air which makes its way under pressure through the graphite,
the converse effect must be produced on the air left behind. But
the latter result of atmolysis cannot be made apparent without a
change in the mode of experimenting.
    With the view of effecting an increase in the proportion of
 oxygen, :1 volume of air, con<U+FB01>ned in a jar suspended over mer
 cury, was allowed to communicate through a graphite plate of 2
 millims. in thickness, with a vacuum sustained by means of an
 air-pump, the gauge being about 1 inch only below the height of
the barometer during the whole time of experimenting.
    The jar containing the air to be atmolysed was formed of a

plain glass cylinder, open at both ends, and about 400 millims.
in height (15-75 inches). The upper end was closed by a thick
plate of gutta percha cemented on. This plate was itself pene
trated by a wide glass tube, descending about an inch into the
jar. The last tube carried the graphite disc, which was 27 mil
lims. (1'O4 inch) in diameter, suf<U+FB01>cient to close the lower end of
the tube upon which it was cemented. The other or upper end
of the same tube was <U+FB01>tted with a cork and quill tube, and was
put into communication with a large bell jar upon the plate of
 the air-pump.
    The permeation was slow, owing to the unusual thickness of
the graphite plate, occupying three hours to drain away one-half
of the original volume of air in the jar. The air remaining
behind in the jar was examined in a series of experiments, in
which the original volume was reduced to one-half, one-fourth,
one-eighth, and one-sixteenth.
    The residual air, reduced to one-half, gave in two experiments
21-4 and 21-57 per cent. of oxygen, the air of the atmosphere
being by the same analytical process 21 per cent.
    Reduced to one-fourth of its volume, the residual air gave, in
two experiments, 2195 and 22-0] per cent. of oxygen.
    Reduced to one-eighth of its volume, the air gave 22-54 per
cent. of oxygen.
    Reduced to one-sixteenth of its volume, the air gave 23-02 per
 cent. of oxygen. The proportion of oxygen had therefore increased
about one-tenth in the last experiment, where the effect is
greatest.
    When the numbers are compared, it appears that by a reduc
 tion to half its volume the air gains about one-half per cent. of
 oxygen; when this last air is reduced to one-half again, another
 half per cent. of oxygen is gained, and so on—the gain in the
 proportion of oxygen increasing in an arithmetical ratio, while
 the volume of air is diminished in a geometrical ratio, or as the
 powers of the number 2.

    The densities of oxygen and nitrogen approach too nearly to
 admit of any considerable separation being effected by this
 method. The density of oxygen being taken as 1, that of ni
 trogen is 0-8785. The square roots of these numbers are 1 and

    The velocity of nitrogen therefore exceeds that of oxygen by
about 6'7 per cent. Hence by a simple diifusion of a whole
volume of air the oxygen could only be increased 6'7 per cent.,
according to theory. In experiments such as the preceding, only
one-half of the volume of the air is diffused, and consequently
only one-half of the stated amount of concentration of oxygen
could possibly be produced at each step. About three-fourths
of the theoretical separation is actually obtained, although the
apparatus works at an obvious disadvantage from the air within
the jar being at rest.
    This diffusive method of separation recalls the original obser
vation of Dobereiner on the escape of hydrogen gas from a <U+FB01>s
sured jar standing over water, which will always hold its place
in scienti<U+FB01>c history as the starting-point of the experimental
 study of gaseous diifusion. That observation proved to be an
 instance of double diffusion, air entering the jar by the <U+FB01>ssure at
 the same time that hydrogen escaped by it—although, as Dobe
reiner looked upon the phenomenon, it was more akin to single
 diffusion or the passage of gas in one direction only *.
    The atmolytic power of other diffuing-plates was tested, besides
the arti<U+FB01>cial graphite.
    The barometrical diffusiometer already described was closed by
 a plate of red unglazed earthenware, 4 millims. in thickness,
which was attached to the glass by resinous cement.
    Dry air was swept over the upper surface, as in operating with
 the graphite plate. With a mercurial column of 340 millims.
 falling to 200 millims., the air which entered was found to con
 tain 7945 per cent. of nitrogen, instead of '79. With a column
of mercury, maintained at 508 millims. in the tube, the air enter
ing contained 7972 nitrogen, and with a column beginning at
 761 millims., the full barometrical height, and falling to 679
 millims. in seven minutes, the air entering contained 8021
 nitrogen.    This is a full degree of separation, exceeding 1 per
 cent., while the time was greatly shorter than with graphite.

   The separation is su<U+FB02>iciently decided, and is certainly remark
able considering the comparatively loose texture of the stucco
plate. The gas entered in the two last experiments in about one
minute, which appears too rapid a passage, and not to be attended
with increased separation, compared with the immediately pre
ceding experiment, in which the pressure was less and the pas
sage of the gas proportionally slower. In all such highly porous
plates, we have always to apprehend the passage of a large pro
portion of the gas in the manner of capillary transpiration, where
no separation takes place.
   It may be concluded that all porous masses, however loose
their texture, will have some e<U+FB01>'ect in separating mixed gases
moving through them under pressure. The air enteringa room
by percolating through a wall of brick or a coat of plaster will
thus become richer in nitrogen, in a certain small measure, than
the external atmosphere.
                         The Tube Atmolyser.
   In the application of diffusion through a porous septum to
separate mixed gases, as a practical analytical method, it is desi
rable that the process should be more rapid than it can be made
with the use of graphite and other di<U+FB01>iusing-plates of small size,
and also that the process should if possible be a continuous one.
Both objects are attained in a considerable degree by adapting a
tube of porous earthenware to the purpose. Nothing has been
found to answer better than the long stalk of a Dutch tobacco
pipe used as the porous tube. A tube of this description, about
2 feet long and having an internal diameter of 2'5 millims., is
<U+FB01>xed by means of perforated corks within a glass or metallic tube,a
few inches less in length and aboutlg inch in diameter (e,i, <U+FB01>g. 8),
as in the construction of a Liebig condenser. A second quill
tube (12) is inserted in one of the end cork, and affords the means
of communication between the annular space and the vacuum
of an air-pump. The external surface of the corks, and of those
portions of the pipe-stalk which project beyond the enclosing

          Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases. 429
   tube, should be coated with a
   resinous varnish,to render them
   impermeable to air. Now, a
   good vacuum being obtained
   within the outer tube, and sus
   tained by the action of an air
   pump, the mixed gas is made to
   enter and traverse the clay tube.
   More or less of gas is drained .
   off through the porous walls and
   pumped away, while a portion
   courses on and escapes by the
  other extremity of the clay tube,
   where it may be collected. The
   stream of gas diminishes as it
   proceeds, like a river <U+FB02>owing
   over a pervious bed. The lighter
   and more diffusive constituent
   of the mixed gases is drawn
   most largely into the vacuum,
  leaving the denser constituent,
   in a more concentrated condi
  tion, to escape by the exit end
                                     8.
                                     Fig.

   slowly the mixed gas is moved
' through that tube, the larger
  the proportion of light gas that
  is drained off into the vacuum,
  and the more concentrated does
  the heavy gas become. The
  rate of <U+FB02>ow of the mixed gas
  can he commanded by either
  discharging it from a gas-holder,
  or drawing it into a gas-receiver,
  in either case by a regulated

    To observe the e<U+FB01>"ect of a more
  or less rapid passage through

  ing pressure was varied so as to
  allow a constant volume of half

to place so wide a tube in a vertical position, and to admit the
air by the upper and draw it off by the lower extremity of the
tube. The proportion of oxygen in the half-litre of air collected
was as follows :

 The proportion of oxygen in the air circulated appears thus to
 increase with the slowness of its passage through the tube atmo
 lyser. The proportion of air drawn into the air-pump vacuum
 must be very large when the time is protracted; but the addi
 tional concentration of oxygen appears small.
    The preceding observations being made by means of a porous
 tube which may be considered wide and of considerable capacity
 with reference to its internal surface, the experiment was varied
 by substituting a porous tube about eight times as long, very
 narrow, and therefore of small internal capacity. This second
 atmolyser was composed of twelve ordinary tobacco-pipe stems,
 each about 10 inche in length and of 1'9 millimi internal dia
 meter, connected together by vulcanized eaoutchouc adapters so
 as to form a single tube. Having <U+FB02>exible joints, the tube was
 folded up and placed within a glass cylinder that could be ex
 hausted. Air was then circulated through this atmolyser by the
 pressure of several inches of water. The instrument appeared
 to work with most advantage when the air delivered at the exit
 tube amounted to about one-fourth of a litre per hour. A
 volume of 268 cubic centimetres, which had circulated in one
 hour, was found to contain 24137 per cent. of oxygen. The
 current was then made slower, so that only 108 cub. centims. of
 gas passed and were collected in one hour, but with little further
 concentration of the oxygen. The result, however, is interesting
 as being the highest concentration of oxygen yet obtained by an
 instrument of this kind. The air collected was composed of

The increase of oxygen is 3'5 per cent.; that is, an increase of
167 upon 100 oxygen originally present in the air.
    With the single pipe-stalk, 24 inches long, <U+FB01>rst described, the
oxygen of atmospheric air was concentrated about 2 per cent.
when one litre was transmitted in one hour. Of 450 cub. centims.

 About 9 litres were drawn into the vacuum at the same time.
    The separation of the gases of atmospheric air is a severe trial
 of the powers of the atmolyser, owing to the small difference in
 the speci<U+FB01>c gravities of these gases. But where a great disparity
 in density exists, the extent of the separation may become very
 considerable.
     Several experiments were made upon a mixture of equal
 volumes of oxygen and hydrogen carried through the single tube
 atmolyser, 24 inches in length.
     1. Of the mixture described, 7'5 litres entered the tube and

is not explosive till the hydrogen rises to 11 per cent.
   To illustrate the analogy of diifusion into a vacuum with dif
fusion into air, the outer glass tube of the diffuser was now with
drawn, and the porous tube of the instrument was exposed directly
to the air of the atmosphere. A mixture of equal volumes of
oxygen and hydrogen was again transmitted at the same rate of
velocity as in experiment 1.

A nearly similar concentration of the oxygen of the mixed gas is
here observed as appeared in experiment 1 ; but the gas collected
is now diluted with air which has entered by di<U+FB01>usion. The
external air manifestly discharges the same function in the latter
experiment which the air-pump vacuum discharged in the former
experiment.

   The diffusiometer was much improved in construction by Pro
fessor Bunsen, from the application of a lever arrangement to
raise and depress the tube in the mercurial trough; but the
mass of stucco forming the porous plate in his instrument ap
pears too voluminous, and, from being dried by heat, is liable
to detach itself from the walls of the glass tube. The result
obtained of 3'4 for hydrogen, which diverges so far from the
theoretical number, is, however, no longer insisted upon by that
illustrious physicist. It is indeed curious that my old experi
ments generally rather exceeded than fell short of the theoretical
number for hydrogen, \/006926 = 3-7994. With stucco as the
material, the cavities existing in the porous plate form about one
fourth of its whole bulk, and affect sensibly the ratio in question
according as they are or are not included in the capacity of the
instrument.     Beginning the diffusion always with these cavities,
as well as the tube, <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen, the numbers now
obtained with a stucco plate of 12 millims. in thickness and
dried without heat, were 3783, 3'8, and 3739 when the volume

         Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.       433'
of the cavities of the stucco is added to both the air and hydrogen
volumes diffused ; and 3'93I, 3-949, and 3883 when such addi
tion is not made to these volumes. The graphite plate, on the
other hand, being very thin, and the volume of its pores too
 minute to require to be taken into account, its action is not
 attended with the same uncertainty. With a graphite plate of
 2 millims. in thickness, the number for hydrogen into air was
 3876 instead of 3-8; and for hydrogen into oxygen 4-124
 instead of 4. With a graphite plate of 1 millim. in thickness,
 hydrogen gave 3'993 to air 1.          With a plate of the same
 material 0-5 millim. in thickness, the proportional number for
 hydrogen to air rose to 3-984, 4068, and 4067. An equally
 considerable departure from the theoretical number was observed
  when hydrogen was diffused into oxygen or into carbonic acid,
 instead of air. All these experiments were made with dry gases
 and over mercury. It appears that the numbers are most in
  accordance with theory when the graphite plate is thick, and the
  diffusion slow in consequence. If the diffusion be very rapid,
  as it is with the thin plates, something like a current is possibly
  formed within the channels of the graphite, taking the direction
  of the hydrogen and carrying back in masses a little air, or the
  slower gas, whatever it may be. I cannot account otherwise for
  the slight predominance which the lighter and faster gasappears
  always to acquire in diffusing through the porous septum.
          Interdi<U+FB01>usion of Gases without an intervening septum.
     The relative velocity with which different gases diffuse is
  shown by the di<U+FB02>iusiometer, but the absolute velocity of the
  molecular movement cannot be ascertained by the same instru
  ment. For that purpose it appears requisite that a gas should
  be allowed to diffuse into air through a wide opening.
     In certain recentexperiments, a heavy gas, such as carbonic
  acid, was allowed to rise by diffusion into a cylindrical column of
  air, pretty much as a saline solution is allowed to rise into a
  column of water in my late experiments upon the diffusion of
  liquids. This method of gaseous diffusion appears to admit of con
  siderable precision, and deserves to be pursued further. A glass
  cylinder of 0-57 metre (22'4.4 inches) in height had the lower
' tenth part of its volume occupied with carbonic acid, and the upper
  nine-tenths with air, in a succession of experiments: thermo
  meter 16° Cent. After the lapse of a certain number of minutes,
  the upper tenth part of the volume was drawn off from the top
  of the jar and examined for carbonic acid. Before the carbonic
  acid appeared above, it had ascended (that is, it had diffused)
  a distance of 0-513 metre, or rather more than half a metre.
  After the lapse of 5 minutes, the carbonic acid so found in two

434       Mr. T. Graham on the Molecular Mobility of Gases.
experiments amounted to 0'4 and 0'32 per cent. respectively. In
7 minutes the carbonic acid observed was 1'02 and 0'90 per cent.;
mean 0'96 per cent. The effect of diffusion is now quite sen
sible, and it may be said that about 1 per cent. of carbonic acid
has diffused to a distance of half a metre in seven minutes.
   A portion of carbonic acid has therefore travelled by diifusion
at an average rate of 73 millims. per minute. It may be added
that hydrogen was found to di<U+FB01>'use downwards, in air contained
in the same cylindrical jar, at the rate of 350 millims. per minute,
or about <U+FB01>ve times as rapidly as the carbonic acid ascended.
In these experiments the glass cylinder was loosely packed with
cotton wool, to impede the action of currents in the column of
air ; but this precaution was found to be unnecessary, as similar
results were afterwards obtained in the absence of the cotton.
To illustrate the regularity of the results, I may complete this
statement by exhibiting the proportion of carbonic acid found in
the upper stratum already referred to, after the lapse of differ
ent periods of time.

   In eighty minutes the proportion of carbonic acid had risen to
8'75 per cent., 10 per cent. being the proportion which would
indicate the completion of the process of diffusion.
   The same intestine movement must always prevail in the air
of the atmosphere, and with even greater velocity, in the pro
portion of 1 to 1'176, the relative 'di<U+FB01>'usion-ratios of carbonic
acid and air. It is certainly remarkable that in perfectly still
air its molecules should spontaneously alter their position, and
move to a distance of half a metre, in any direction, in the course
of <U+FB01>ve or six minutes. The molecules of hydrogen gas disperse
themselves to the distance of a third of a metre in a single
minute. Such a molecular movement may become an agency
of considerable power in distributing heat through a volume of
gas. It appears to account for the high convective power
observed in hydrogen, the most di<U+FB02>'usive of gases.

LXI. On Thermo-electrical Currents from the Condensation of
    Vapour, and the Evaporation of Water. By JOHN MICKLE*.
IF we take 12 inches each of iron and copper wire (No. 20 is
       what I have used) and twist them together at one end, we
have a thermo-pair giving very good de<U+FB02>ections when the loose
ends are attached to a sensitive galvanometer, and the twisted
end applied to any source of heat.       But by uniting a series of
such pairs, in lengths of 6 inches each, a very cheap and useful
pile can be constructed capable of appreciating radiant heat from
the hand at a distance of 6 inches, and from a luminous source,
such as a jet of gas, at a distance of 12 inches.
    I was working with a wire pile of this description, consisting
of 40 pairs, endeavouring to obtain minus de<U+FB02>ections by blowing
upon it through a glass tube 24 inches in length and -1- inch in
diameter, but found the deviations produced indicating plus
instead of minus—due to heat instead of cold. _ Knowing that
air from the lungs contains much moisture, it appeared to me
probable that the de<U+FB02>ections proceeded from the heat conse
 quent upon the condensation of the vapour upon the wires of
 the pile. To test the truth of this conjecture, a current of dry
 air was directed upon the face of the pile from a pair of bellows,
 but without result. The friction of the air upon the wires of the
 pile could therefore have nothing to do with the production of
 the current. Since dry air did not seem to be concerned in the
 result, my next step was to try vapour. With this object in
 view, I heated some water in a glass retort and allowed the steam
 to escape freely from the mouth of the vessel. On bringing one
 face of the pile into contact with the ascending column of vapour,
 at a distance of 12 inches from the ori<U+FB01>ce of the retort, a power
 ful de<U+FB02>ection of the needle of the galvanometer instantly mani
 fested itself. There remained yet another consideration. Would
 not a voltaic effect be produced by the oxidation of the iron in
 contact with copper in an atmosphere of steam ? To satisfy this
 objection, the experiment was repeated with copper and plati
  num wires; but the results differed only in the direction and
 intensity of the current—the former being contrary, and the
  latter weaker than with iron and copper wires.
     Assuming that the previous experiments justify the con
  clusion that the condensation of vapour originates a positive
  current, then obviously a negative current ought to result from
  evaporation. To determine whether this deduction was accord
  ant with fact, the following arrangement was adopted. Taking
  only a single pair of the iron and copper wires twisted together
                      * Communicated by the Author.

 4.36    Dr. Rankine on the Eapansive Energy of Heated I1/ater.
 at one end, as previously described, the twisted part having a
 length of 4 inches, I united the loose ends to the electrodes of
 the galvanometer; and over the twisted portion of the wires
 forming the pile I doubled a piece of tinfoil 4 inches square.
 On touching a part of the foil with the <U+FB01>nger, the needle exhi
 bited a deviation in the same direction as in the previous expe
 riments in which the effect was attributed to the heat liberated
 by condensation; and on wetting the foil with a sponge having
 the water squeezed out of it by the hand, a de<U+FB02>ection in the same
 direction occurred; but as soon as the heat communicated to the
 water by the hand began to be carried off by evaporation of the
 <U+FB02>uid from the foil, a contrary deviation was established, lasting
 as long as any moisture remained upon the foil. If the wet foil
 was exposed to the sun’s rays when these were not too intense,
a negative de<U+FB02>ection was maintained until evaporation ceased,
when the needle experienced a contrary deviation due to direct
solar action. _
    Since obtaining these results, I have tried to adapt the arrange
ment described to hygrometric purposes, by merely suspending
a strip of cotton over the tinfoil with its ends immersed in a
cup of water. The evaporation which then takes place from the
surface of the cotton of course varies with the dryness or humi
dity of the atmosphere; but as these latter causes accelerate or
retard evaporation from the cotton cloth, so also is a greater or
lesser quantity of heat abstracted from the wires, and a corre
sponding variation in the de<U+FB02>ection produced. The readings of a
wet- and dry-bulb thermometer have been compared with those
of the above arrangement (which may be designated a thermo
electrical hygrometer), and their general correspondence observed;
but the details of these experiments, and of some other peculiar
thermo-electrical phenomena, must be reserved for a subsequent
communication.

   N my “Experiments on Films” (Phil. Mag. August 1861),
       and “On the Cohesion-Figures of Liquids” (Phil. Mag.
October 1861 and March 1862), I had frequent occasion to
notice the spheroidal condition of liquids at ordinary tempera
                            * Communicated by the Author.

  438        Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Spheroidal Condition
  tures. For example, if a single drop of a liquid, such as an
  essential oil, be gently deposited from the end of a glass rod on
  the surface of perfectly clean water in a chemically clean glass, it
  forms a characteristic <U+FB01>lm or cohesion-<U+FB01>gure; but if a second
  drop be gently delivered to the surface of the <U+FB01>lm, it will rest or
  roll about upon it, without contact, in the spheroidal form.
     In a note communicated by M. Meunier to the Academy of
  Sciences at Paris (Comptes Remlus, August 17, 1863), the results
  of some experiments are given on the globular form that liquids
  may assume on surfaces of their own kind. M. Meunier’s mode
  of manipulating is to take up alcohol, for example, in a. pipette
  and drop it upon the surface of alcohol. The globules formed
  last but a very short time; they roll about on the surface with
  out being in contact, as was ingeniously proved by dropping
  alcohol on tincture of iodine, when the globules during their
  brief existence did not become coloured. Another method was
  to dip a glass rod into the liquid so as to take up a suf<U+FB01>cient
  quantity to deposit a drop on its surface. In this way all liquids
  formed globules with more or less di<U+FB02>iculty; but there was no
. di<U+FB01>iculty if the liquid were <U+FB01>rst covered with a layer of another
  liquid not miscible with it. M. Meunier’s conclusion is that all
  liquids possess the property of passing into the spheroidal state.
     M. Meunier does not seem to have pursued the subject further;
  had he done so, he would probably have noticed other circum
  stances which seem to me to deserve attention, if only as further
  illustrations of that wonderful property of cohesion in liquids, of
  which the spheroidal state is an example. If, for example, the
  experiment be made with essential oils, and the duration of the
  liquid in the spheroidal state be noted, we may, I think, obtain
  a rough approximative method of determining the age of an
  essential oil; for I have found that the fresher the oil the greater
  is its cohesive force as expressed by its duration in the spheroidal
  form at common temperatures.
     For example, oil of turpentine, as purchased at an oil and
  colour shop, was examined in the following manner. Three glass
  capsules, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, each about 2% inches in dia
  meter, were nearly <U+FB01>lled with water and placed in the mouths of
  test-glasses before the light. A drop of the turpentine was de
  posited on the surface of each from the end of a glass rod; the
  drop in each case <U+FB02>ashed out into a <U+FB01>lm which nearly covered
  the surface of the water. A second drop of turpentine was gently
  delivered to the surface of the <U+FB01>lm No. 1, when it formed
  a spheroid, the duration of which was measured in seconds.
  When the spheroid vanished, a similar one was formed on the
  <U+FB01>lm in No.2, and its duration measured; and so for No.3.
  Eight observations were taken on each <U+FB01>lm.

    The mean duration of a spheroid of common turpentine in this
series of observations was 15% seconds. This turpentine was di
stilled of caustic potash, and a similar series of observations
immediately made with the fresh distillate. The superior cohe
sive force of the distillate over that of the common turpentine
was shown at once by the greatly diminished proportions of the
<U+FB01>lm. The <U+FB01>lm of the common turpentine was nearly 2% inches
in diameter; that of the distillate was at <U+FB01>rst only a <U+FB02>attened
drop, which gradually increased in size, by the accretion of other
drops, to about the diameter of a <U+FB02>orin or half-a-crown. On
going through a similar series of observations with these <U+FB01>lms,
the duration of the spheroids was as follows :—

 So that the mean duration of a globule of the distillate compared
 with that of the common turpentine is as about 7 to 3. Both
 the above series of experiments were made on the same morning;
 the weather was <U+FB01>ne; the reading of the dry-bulb thermometer
 gave 62129, and that of the wet-bulb 55§°. If the spheroidal
 condition of liquids depends on the existence of a layer of vapour
 which prevents contact between the globule and the surface
 beneath, it is quite intelligible why the experiment in this form
 should succeed better when the evaporative force is strong than
 when it is weak. Indeed in damp or wet weather the duration
 of the globules is much diminished; or it may be dif<U+FB01>cult to form
 them at all, even in a warm room.
     That there is no contact between the globule and the <U+FB01>lm may
 be proved in several ways :—(1) There is a slight depression in the
 <U+FB01>lm just below the globule ; and this depression accompanies the
 globule when it rolls about, which it sometimes does. (2) The
  drop may fall with some force from the end of the glass rod, as
 from the height of an inch, and roll about without being absorbed.

 440 ‘Spheroidal Condition of Liquids at Common Temperatures.
 (3) The glass rod, with the drop hanging from it, may be lowered
 upon the <U+FB01>lm several times so as to <U+FB02>atten the drop, without its
 being absorbed. In some cases, however, there is contact between
 the spheroid and the surface beneath at a single point; for in
rolling about, the spheroid will sometimes leave a trail of liquid,
 and so diminish in size until it suddenly vanishes by being ab
 sorbed. In all cases the drop vanishes suddenly, apparently by
 <U+FB02>attening at its under surface, and thus coming into contact
 with the liquid <U+FB01>lm below; but at the moment of disappearing
 a small globule is sometimes shot up from below, and this con
 tinues on the surface for a short time.
    The spheroid, whether rolling about or stationary, displays by
the rapid motions of its particles the struggle that is going on
between gravity and cohesion. If a minute portion of lycopo
dium powder be shaken over the globule, and this rude treat
ment does not cause it to break up, the powder will be seen
streaming rapidly down_the outer surface of the sphe1'oid, and
ascending by the central vertical axis to separate again at the
top, and stream over the surface again to the bottom—present
ing, in fact, a <U+FB01>gure something like that given in the books to
represent the boiling of water.                             -
    The longer duration of a spheroid of the fresh -or superior
over that of the common oil has been veri<U+FB01>ed in a number of
cases. For example, a common oil of bergamot had a duration
of about 5", while that sold to me as a very choice oil (marked
super) lasted from 21" to 27". Rosemary lasted 7"; the distil
late 13"; origanum 41' to 5"; the distillate 10" to 11". Several
para<U+FB02>ine oils from different makers showed great variations in
their cohesive force.
   There is one curious circumstance that must be noted, and that
is that a drop of one liquid will not form a spheroid on a <U+FB01>lm of
another liquid at ordinary temperatures; or it does so with di<U+FB02>i
culty, and the duration is very short. This remark applies to
the para<U+FB02>ine oils of different makers, and even to oils from
plants of the same genus.     Thus the oil of Eucalyptus amy_gda
line will not assume the spheroidal condition on a <U+FB01>lm of E. oleosa,
or on one of E. yoniocalyw. Adrop of origanum is immediately
absorbed on a <U+FB01>lm of rosemary ; as is lavender or turpentine on
origanum ; but after these failures, a drop of the same kind of
liquid as that of the <U+FB01>lm will form a spheroid without much dif
<U+FB01>culty, other circumstances being favourable.
   In no case was I able by my method of experimenting to pro
duce a spheroid of a fatty oil on a <U+FB01>lm of fatty oil at common
temperatures. No sooner, however, was heat introduced, than
the di<U+FB02>iculty ceased. A very clear limpid sample of a <U+FB01>sh-oil
was raised to 320°, and spheres, not spheroids, of <U+FB01>sh and

       Prof. Cayley on Di<U+FB02>erential Equations and Umbilici.       411
other oils, and of water, alcohol, ether, &'.c., were readily formed,
and rolled about upon its surface with great rapidity.
    In conclusion, I may perhaps be allowed to refer to a method
of producing the spheroidal condition of liquids in the cold
which was published by me, together with an illustrative wood
cut, in a forgotten journal so long back as 1836. If a glass
 goblet be about three parts <U+FB01>lled with spirits of wine, and a
<U+FB01>ddle-bow be drawn across the edge, the usual crispating fans
 from the vibrating segments will be produced; but, in addition
to this, the spirit at the surface will be thrown into globules
 which will be rolled upon the less agitated portions, and will
 mark the nodes in the form of a four-, or six-, or eight-rayed
 star very perfectly. These <U+FB01>gures of Chladni may also be pro
 duced in globules with admirable sharpness by pouring turpen
 tine on water at about 150° in a goblet, so as to form a thin
 layer.

THE differential equation for the curves of curvature in the
        neighbourhood of an umbilicus was obtained in a form
such as
                   (b~'"+vy)(P’—1)+2(fw+9y)11=0;
and it was only because this equation did not appear to be
readily integrable, that I considered, instead of it, the particular
form
                        y(p9—l) +2m.zp=0.
But the general equation can be integrated; and the result pre
sents itself in a simple form. For, returning to the differential
equation
                  (be +¢y)(r’- 1) +2(f~'-' +az1)p=0.

      The conics confocal with a given conic form a system similar
  in its properties to that of the curves of curvature of a quadric
  surface; and the theory of the last-mentioned system may he
  studied by means of the system of confocal conics. Consider
~ then the equation
                              JL        1/’ =1
                             a“+z      b’+z       ’
  which, if 2' be an arbitrary parameter, belongs to the conics
                              me    ya
  confocal with the ellipse a—Q + be = 1. Treating z as a coordinate,
   the equation represents a surface of the third order, which is such
   that its section by any plane parallel to the plane of wy is a conic ;
   and the confocal conics are the projections on the plane of my, by
   lines parallel to the axis of z, of the sections of the surface.
      The sections by the planes of zm, zy are the parabolas me = 2: + a2
   and _z/"=z+b2 respectively. When z>—b’, the ordinates in
   each parabola are real, and these ordinates give the semiaxes of
   the elliptic section. When z> -a9<—b9, then only the para
   bola section in the plane of my has a real ordinate, and the sections
   are hyperbolic ; and when z< —a’, the section is altogether
   imaginary. The section in the planes z= -129 is the pair of coin
   cident lines 3/“=0, z= — b“, and the section in the plane z= -119
   is the pair of coincident lines z= —a’, .z~*=O; or, in other words,
   the plane z+bQ=0 touches the surface along the line 31:0, and
   the plane 2+ aQ=O touches the surface along the line .z'=O: this
   at once appears from the integral form
                (z+ a“)(z+bQ)—.z3(z+b9) —-y*(z-1-a‘) =0.
   The points (z= —b9, y=O, .z’= iv a’—b*)and (z= —a*,.z'=O,
   3/= i\/122-119) are conical points; the last two are however
   imaginary points on the surface. To <U+FB01>nd the nature of the sur
   face about one of the <U+FB01>rst-mentioned two points, say the point
   ( = -— b9, 3; =O,.z'=\/a’— bi), taking this point for the origin and
   writing therefore \/a*—b9+.z', y, and ——b9+z in the place of
   w, y, 2 respectively, the equation becomes

the plane of 2:0 in the lines z=O, z=2.z"\/a“—b’ (and therefore
such that its sections parallel to the plane of .z-y are parabolas),
and meeting the plane of yz in the lines z= iy\/a’—b9 (the
origin .being at the vertex of the cone or conical point of the
surface).

where the factor my arises from the level lines (z+b*=O, 3/=0)
and (z+aQ=O, m=0).            Throwing out this factor, the equation
becomes

  ~                       me+n=c
where the factor p=O corresponds to the section y=0 by the
plane z+b’=O: and taking the conical point for origin, and
observing that the polar of the line .z'= , 31:0 in regard to the
tangent cone is z— a/:\/a’—b"=0, then writing the equation of
the tangent cone in the form

the two tangent planes through (a:=O, y=O) are given by the
equation .z3+y"‘=O; and for these planes we have p’+1=O.
The factor 119+ 1=O determines therefore the directions of the
envelope at the conical point.

           LXV. On the Dynamics of the Galvanic Battery.
                   By Professor A. W. WILLIAMSON *.
 IN the title given to this evening’s discourse, I have used a
       hard word—Dynamics, which suggests the study of active
 forces, and of calculations about those forces. I thought it was
 no more than fair to put such a hard Word into the title of the
 discourse, because the title was intended as some sort of descrip
 tion of the thing itself; and there is no doubt that the matter
which I have to bring under your consideration tonight requires
for its appreciation some of that sustained and careful attention
which is given to mathematical subjects. The conclusion, of
which it will be my endeavour to convince you, depends on a
chain of facts: each link of the chain is a very simple fact, but
yet, if we lose one of them, the chain is broken, and the conclu
sion falls to the ground.        Having given you this warning of a
very dry discourse, I am bound to state, in mitigation, that of
actual calculations we shall only need addition and subtraction.
    I have on this table a couple of stout copper wires, one of
which is in contact with one pole of a Grove’s battery of 100
cells, whilst the other wire is in contact with the other pole.
They are very quiet common-place looking copper wires, though
capable of giving signs of their pent-up energies; and if I were
to disconnect them from the poles of the battery, they would be
found just like any other copper wires; but whilst in contact
with the respective poles, these wires are endowed with latent
energies which, according to the direction given to them, are
capable of producing e<U+FB02>'ects the most varied and the most mar
   ’ Communicated by the Author, having been delivered at the Newcastle
Meeting of the British Association, August 28, 1863.

                      of the Galvanic Battery.                  453
vellous. We get from them heat sui<U+FB01>cient to melt the most
refractory substances, or light of a dazzling brilliancy, which
approaches nearer to that of the sun than does any other arti
<U+FB01>cial light. With a small fraction of the actual power of these
wires we can get volleys of electrical discharges, each one so
powerful that the strongest man could not endure it ; or we can
endow iron with the force of magnetism in its greatest intensity ;
and the compass forgets its steadfast direction when brought
near one of these wires, and commits vagaries which would cer
tainly appear most alarming to navigators who are accustomed to
trust their lives to its directions; and last, but not least, we can
decompose the strongest compounds, or combine the most slug
gish and inert of elements by the action of the forces at work in
these wires.
    If a fairy gave you her wand, and told you that it was endowed
with power to evoke <U+FB01>ve of the chief forces in nature, as they
are often called, viz. heat, light, electricity, magnetism, and che
 mical af<U+FB01>nity, with all their wondrous effects, you would surely
 not despise the gift, or neglect to learn its use.    Now this wire
 is such a wand, and Science is the fairy who gives it you; but,
 like a wise and bene<U+FB01>cent fairy, she tells you that you must
 patiently examine and study its nature, and that its use will be
 proportioned to the progress of that study.
    The successive discoveries and theories which have rapidly suc
 ceeded one another in this <U+FB01>eld of inquiry, and given us a know
 ledge of this wonderful instrument, constitute one of the most
 brilliant and instructive chapters of scienti<U+FB01>c history. It is par
 ticularly interesting to notice how the metaphysical theory of
 contact force, invented by the illustrious Volta, has gradually
 given way before the steady advance of chemical discoveries, and
 how we now explain it by describing the actual nature of the
 transformations which occur in the working of the battery.
 Many a clear head and steady hand has helped to work out our
 knowledge of the subject ; but towering above them all in undis
 turbed preeminence, we see the <U+FB01>gure of our own Faraday, a
 man to whose fertile genius and indefatigable industry we owe
 the chief discoveries relating to the chemistry of the galvanic
 battery.
    But chemistry alone is unable to explain the forces at work in
 this wonderful instrument, she is obliged to call other sciences
 to her aid, and to combine physical and mechanical discoveries
 with chemical ones in her <U+FB01>nal chain of facts.
     It has been proved beyond all dispute that heat is a motion of
  atoms. Whenever the motion of masses is gradually or partially
  arrested by the friction of the particles of one against those of
  the other, we <U+FB01>nd that the particles get heated. Yet there is no

454              Prof. Williamson on the Dynamics
production of force in such a process, only a transfer of motion
from masses to atoms. Picture to yourselves a heavy train at the
top of a railway incline; let the train run freely down the incline
impelled by its own weight alone, and while it rushes down with
headlong speed let the breaks be applied with the utmost force.
The train is stopped; yet the motion which is taken from it is
not destroyed, it is merely transformed into heat, for the friction
at the breaks evolves such intense heat that it is no easy matter
to prevent it setting <U+FB01>re to -the wooden parts above them.
Again, if we drive the piston of a steam-engine up and down
by the pressure of steam, <U+FB01>rst below, then above it, and if this
piston is connected by suitable machinery with moveable masses,
we get those masses set in motion as effectually as if they were
drawn by hundreds or even thousands of horses. And yet in this
case the force is not created any more than in the former instance
it was destroyed; for the steam which presses upon the piston
loses heat by the effort, and the heat is transformed into work,
from which it can be again recovered.
   One of the most important steps of modern science has been
the exact measurement, by Mr. Joule, of the quantity of heat
which corresponds to a given amount of mechanical force. The
force of one pound weight falling 772 feet makes what we call the
unit of heat, viz. that quantity needed to raise the temperature of
a pound of water 1° F. Whenever mechanical force is expended
in heat, or heat transformed into mechanical force, we now know
exactly the proportion of the one which can be got from the
other. You perceive from this that we not only know heat to
be a. motion of atoms, but we have even a de<U+FB01>nite measure of it,
as we have of the weights of the atoms themselves.
   Philosophers had long since suspected that matter must be built
up of atoms; but it is within the last half century that chemistryhas
given actual proof that such is really the case. No doubt there
are some eminent men, for whom everyone entertains very great
respect, who speak of the atomic theory as a mere hypothesis;
and there are also eminent men who speak of the existence of
matter in the same sceptical terms. There is no reasoning upon
physical questions without assuming the existence of matter, and
our friends only deceive themselves when they fancy they can do
without it. And, in like manner, there is no reasoning upon
chemical transformations without the atomic theory. No other
theory has ever been found to explain the facts ; and without it
chemical science, such as it now exists, and I may say <U+FB02>ourishes,
would be transformed into a confused and unmeaning chaos of
facts. Every chemist uses the atomic theory when he attempts
to explain chemical facts ; and chemists are bound to inform
those who study nature and her forces from other points of view,

                         of the Galvanic Battery.               ° 455
that the existence of matter may just as well be denied as the
existence of atoms.
    I felt it my duty to be the more explicit upon this point, because
I believe that we have to look to the further development of the
atomic theory for the chief progress of scienti<U+FB01>c chemistry. I
have to speak to you not only of atoms as really existing, but
also of the movements of those atoms as productive of various
important phenomena. It is now a good many years since I
showed that chemical decompositions are the results of preexist
ing atomic movements, in fact that the force which produces
chemical change is no other than a particular form of atomic
motion.       Some of you may probably feel a little hesitation in
 admitting that, while a given mass of matter remains in the same
 place, the atoms of which it is composed are yet in a state of in
 tensely rapid vibration. Let us take the example of a gas, say
 common air. If air really consists of little atoms in a state of
 rapid vibration striking against the sides of any vessel in which
 the air is con<U+FB01>ned, and rebounding in virtue of their elasticity,
 what must we expect to happen if air was introduced into a ves
 sel having a porous side, or a side with a number of very small
 holes in it? Of course the atoms would pass through the small
 holes and get out.
     In illustration of this, I will show you one of those beautiful
  phenomena of so-called Diffusion which have attracted the atten
 tion of so many able investigators of late years, especially of my
  distinguished friend the Master of the Mint. I have here a
  vessel of which the upper part consists of a porous material,
  viz. unglazed earthenware. The vessel contains air, and I assert
  that the atoms of which this enclosed air consists are striking
  against the porous sides of the vessel and escaping through
  them. But the outer air is getting into the vessel as fast as the
  inner air gets out, so that the vessel does not get emptier or
  fuller, and the blue liquid in this tube, which is really the neck
  of the bottle, remains unmoved. I will now put the apparatus
  (still full of air) into a chamber full of a gas consisting of much
  lighter and more moveable atoms than those of air, in fact into
  a chamber full of hydrogen, and you see already that the blue
  liquid is being driven out by the neck of my vessel. This
  proves to us that the light atoms of hydrogen are getting in
  through the porous sides quicker than the heavy atoms of air
  get out. Each atom of hydrogen weighs only Tlzth as much
  as an atom of nitrogen, which is the chief constituent of air:
  but it gets no bene<U+FB01>t from its lightness beyond the power
   of moving faster, and I will prove to you that gases need not
   differ in density in order to diffuse into one another, by <U+FB01>lling
  this bell jar with a gas called nitric oxide, which is very nearly

  456              Prof. Williamson on Ike Dynamics
  equal in density to atmospheric air. At the other side of the
  porous disc which closes the mouth of the bell jar, will be a
  similar jar marked by a black band, containing common air ; and
  if we get red fumes in the jar with a black rim, that will be a
  proof that nitric oxide has come out and mixed with the air in
  that black jar. If, on the other hand, we get red fumes in the
  jar with the white rim, that will prove to us that air has got into
  that jar and mixed with the nitric oxide contained in it. You
  see by the result that each gas is moving through the porous
  septum. I must now go a step further, and ask you to follow
  me into some chemical considerations—in fact the consideration
  of that wonderful process which it has been the chief business,
  and, I may add, the glory of chemistry to explain, I mean the
  process of combustion. We chemists think of combustion mainly
  as a process of combination of different materials with each
  other, forming compounds differing from those materials in their
  properties. But much better for our present purpose is the
  popular view of combustion, which consists in looking upon it as
  a plan for getting heat. You really do not burn coals in order
 to get carbonic acid and water by combining the carbon and
 hydrogen with oxygen from the air ; but you burn them in order
 to heat your houses, or your factories, or steam-boilers, &c.
 Combustion is the process by which some of the inherent mo-~
 tion of atoms is taken from them on combining, and transferred
 in the form of heat to surrounding objects. If you burn a hun
 dredweight of coal, and collect all the heat which is given off by
 its complete combustion, leaving the products as cold as the ori
ginal materials before use, you have enough heat to boil
about 80 hundredweight of water, that is, to heat 80 hundred
weight from 32° F. to 212° F. Now in such an experiment we
may say that all this heat is taken out of the coals and oxygen by
merely combining them, and accordingly the products contain
just so much less heat, or the motion which constitutes heat, than
the original materials before combination.
    If we burn iron, as it very often is burnt in forges, we have
heat given off, and the oxide of iron contains just that much
heat less than the iron and oxygen before combination. Pre
cisely the same holds good when I break this little bulb, and
allow the iron which is contained in it to burn in the chlorine
contained in this tall cylinder. You see evidences of the heat
which is given off by the direct formation of the chloride of iron
from its elements ; and for every pound of chlorine used to form
this compound, there are 1492 degrees of heat evolved, assuming
that the experiment is performed in the presence of water.
    If chlorine is used to burn copper in the same manner, form
ing protochloride of copper, there are 962 degrees of heat evolved

                     of the Galvanic Battery.                 457
for every pound of chlorine taken up; and the less intensity
of the combustion which you witness is an indication of that
smaller evolution of heat.
    Now iron can take chlorine away from any feebler metal,
forming chloride of iron, and turning the feebler metal out of its
compound. For instance, if I take a solution of chloride of
copper (this deep-green liquid) and break a bulb containing
<U+FB01>nely-divided iron inside it, two things will happen at the same
time : chloride of iron will be made, and chloride of copper will
be unmade ; we shall have a yellow solution of iron, and a <U+FB01>ne
red powder consisting of precipitated metallic copper. Before I
begin the experiment, I want you to notice that the chloride of
copper does not act on this air-thermometer, as both are at the
temperature of this room. You see how rapidly the powder of
metallic iron which I throw into the copper solution acts upon
it, destroying the green colour, and precipitating the copper, but
at the same time the liquid is getting hot. The air-thermo
meter now shows a considerable rise of temperature. If you
measured carefully all the heat which is given off when chloride
of iron is formed in this indirect manner, you would <U+FB01>nd it less
than when direct combination takes place. Every pound of
chlorine which goes to form protochloride of iron in this expe
riment gives otf only 530 degrees of heat instead of 14-92.
Whence this difference of 962 degrees of heat? The reason is
obvious: we have not only made chloride of iron, evolving
thereby 1492 degrees of heat, but we have at the same time,
 and in the same liquid, unmade chloride of copper; and the chlo
ride of copper absorbs when unmakiny just as much heat as it
evolved when making, viz. 962 degrees ; so that 962 degrees of
heat are consumed in the decomposition of the chloride of cop
per: I-’-L92—962=53O only are obtained. In this experiment
the iron was used in the form of a <U+FB01>ne powder for the sake of
rapidity of action, and the copper remains in a similar form,
each little fragment of copper being precipitated beside the little
fragment of iron which was taking its chlorine. In fact the two
chemical processes (of combination and decomposition) are mixed
up with one another throughout the liquid. But I can effect
the same decomposition and the same combination in such a way
as to keep them separate, the combination in one part of the
liquid, the decomposition at some distance from it. For this
purpose I put a piece of hard carbon into this porous cylinder,
 and pour some chloride of copper in with it. The porous cylinder
thus <U+FB01>lled is placed in a jar containing hydrochloric acid, and a
 plate of amalgamated zinc is immersed in this acid. I must
then attach the zinc outside the porous cell to the carbon inside
 it by means of a metallic wire. The zinc will then dissolve,

4558             Prof. Williamson on the Dynamics
forming chloride of zinc, and metallic copper will be deposited
from the chloride on the surface of the carbon. The zinc acts
just like the iron in my last experiment, only with a little more
power; and the carbon does not undergo any change whatever:
all the combination takes place on the surface of the zinc plate,
all the decomposition on the surface of the carbon plate, where the
copper is deposited.
    How is it, then, that we have not the full heat of combustion
evolved when the zinc combines, and the correspondingheat
absorbed or cold produced where the copper is deposited from
the chloride? That nothing of the kind occurs-is easily seen;
but the answer to the question involves the theory of the battery,
in fact the understanding of our fairy’s wand; for this little
 wire has an electric current running through it as long as it
 connects the combining and reducing plates. It has the same
 properties (as you can see by the de<U+FB02>ection of the magnetic
 needle suspended beside it) which I mentioned as existing in
 our wires on this table, and can produce the same kind of effect.
 Our little instrument is, in fact, one cell of a galvanic battery.
 If we want more power than this cell affords, we can select a
 chemical process in which the heat evolved by the combination
 is more in excess of the heat absorbed by the decomposition, so
 that more heat will be actually available.‘ Another way of get
 ting more power is by increasing the surface of the plates; and
 a third process is to increase the number of cells, taking care to
 render the action in each cell dependent on that in the next by
 connecting the zinc plate in the <U+FB01>rst with the carbon plate in
 the second, the zinc in the second with the carbon in the third
 cell, and so on in so-called polar order.
    Every cell of a galvanic battery consists necessarily of two
 solid plates capable of conducting electricity, moistened either
 with one liquid, or with two liquids kept from mixing by a
 porous cell, in the pores of which they touch one another. On
 the surface of one of these plates, which is called positive, a pro
 cess of combination of some kind goes on, whether oxidation or
 chlorination, of which the effect is to evolve heat; and at the
 surface of the other plate, which is called negative, a process of
 unburning goes on, by which heat is absorbed. It is not neces
 sary that the process of combination at the surface of the posi
 tive plate should take place, as in the instance before us, between
 metallic particles from the very substance of the plate, and a
 constituent of the liquid; nor is it necessary that the decomposi
 tion on the surface of the negative plate should be always effected
 by the deposition of a metallic body upon the surface of the plates.
 1 have here a little battery consisting of two cells, so constructed
 that the chemical laws of its action are carried out in an entirely

                       of the Galvanic Battery.                 459
different manner. Each cell contains two platinum plates, one
of which is quite clean, while the other is coated with the brown
binoxide of lead. We may consider this plate as consisting of
binoxide of lead, for the platinum beneath it only serves to con
nect the particles of that substance with the conducting wire.
The bright platinum plate is immersed in nitrous acid contained
inside a porous cell, and the peroxide of lead is immersed in
nitric acid outside that porous cell. When the battery is at
work, the nitrous acid becomes oxidized and converted into
nitric acid on the surface of the positive plate, and the peroxide
of lead dissolves off from the surface of the negative plate by
losing oxygen. You can see the facility with which this trans
fer of oxygen takes place from the one body to the other, by the
decolorization of the brown peroxide which takes place when I
mix it in this foot glass with a solution of nitrous acid. You
perceive by the testimony of this little battery that the oxidation
of nitrous acid replaces the chlorination of the zinc in our <U+FB01>rst
cell, and that disoxidation of peroxide of lead here occurs where
dechlorination of copper took place in that cell. In all galvanic
cells the plates communicate not only by the liquids in which
they are immersed, but also by the metallic connecting wires;
and while the cell is at work a galvanic current passes, not
only through the connecting wire, but also through the con
necting liquid.
   Now there is this important difference between metals and
liquid conductors. Wires are very good conductors, whilst
liquids are ‘very bad ones in comparison; and if we put the
two plates into the liquid of a cell without connecting them by
a wire, there is no current, nor is there that chemical process
which we know to be its necessary accompaniment. The use
of the connecting wire‘ does supply what is still Wanted for the
occurrence of the combining process at the one plate, and the
decomposing process at the negative plate, and we are unavoid
ably driven to consider that the electrical current is the process
by which motion or vibration of atoms is transmitted through
that wire from the combustion plate to the separation plate.
The evidence in favour of this conclusion is strengthened, and at
the same time rendered more precise, by a study of the process
which takes place in liquid conductors. It so happens that,
inasmuch as the liquids are composed of several elements, and
as they undergo a permanent change during the process of con
duction, we are able to gain a most valuable insight into the
very behaviour of the component atoms while they are conduct
ing the current. This is so very important a part of my argu
ment, that I must beg leave to state it to you, although I must
confess that it deals with questions respecting the position and

460              Prof. Williamson on the Dynamics
arrangement of atoms which I would gladly have spared you had
it been possible to do so.
   It will be most convenient for our purpose to select for con
sideration the very simple case of a cell containing a zinc plate and
a copper plate immersed in hydrochloric acid. The zinc dis
solves by taking chlorine away from the hydrogen, and hydrogen
is evolved from the surface of the copper plate. It is generally
admitted that the <U+FB01>rst step of the process is the establishment of
a polar arrangement of the molecules of hydrochloric acid of such
kind that the chlorine atoms are turned towards the zinc, the
hydrogen atoms towards the copper.         The atom of chlorine next
to the zinc then combines with it, forming chloride of zinc, and
 at the same time the atom of hydrogen next to the copper is set
free and escapes. But the chlorine cannot combine with the
 zinc without getting rid of its hydrogen at the same time to the
 next atom of chlorine in the chain; and this second atom of
 chlorine must combine with another of hydrogen instead of the
 one which is thus taken from it. This goes on till, at the end
 of this chain of particles, we have in this manner an atom of
hydrogen which loses its chlorine, and cannot get another in
exchange, but escapes uncombined on receiving the necessary
 impulse from the copper plate. In the annexed diagram, Z re
 presents the zinc plate,
 C represents the copper
 plate, and between them
 we have the chain of mo
 lecules of ' hydrochloric
 acid arranged in polar
 order from zinc to cop
 per. If we remove from
 our diagram the chlorine
 from one end and the
 hydrogen from the other,
 we have a chain of mole
 cules in the order in which they are kept after the <U+FB01>rst action,
 an order which we may call antipolar. If matters remained
 in this order, there could be no further combination of zinc
 with chlorine, no further liberation of hydrogen on the cop
 per. We see that there can be no continuous current without
 a motion of the atoms: the atoms of chlorine must come in
 contact with the zinc to combine with it, and the atoms of
 hydrogen in contact with the copper to escape from it, and the
 original polar arrangement must re-establish itself throughout
 the whole liquid from the zinc to the copper before the next
 decomposition ensues.     It would be unnecessary to discuss at
 present the particular manner in which this atomic motion takes

                        of the Galvanic Battery.                  461
place in the conducting liquid; but there is no doubt of the fact
that each atom of chlorine has to take the hydrogen from another
atom of chlorine after each decomposition, and then to get over
so as to touch the positive plate, while the hydrogen gets next
to the negative plate. These atomic motions have been long
since shown to take place in the conducting liquid. Now when
a current of electricity is passing through a liquid, it produces
upon any contiguous magnet the same effects as the same cur
rent running through a metallic conductor.        You will see, when
I send the current of my battery through this tube full of liquid,
that the needle will be de<U+FB02>ected exactly in the same manner as
if I sent a current of equal strength through a rod of metal.
Metallic conductors transmit with facility from the positive plate
those vibrations which carry over the force needed for the libera
tion of the metals at the negative plate ; while liquids sluggishly
and reluctantly allow a similar vibration to take place along their
constituent atoms, so as to enable the atoms to get into the places
 where they are wanted for the chemical action; but the liquid is
 always behindhand with its work, and opposes the chief resist
 ance to the completion of the galvanic circuit.
     We have now got to the point to which I wanted to bring you,
 and I will not attempt any further particulars.       Cur fairy wand
 differs from an ordinary copper wire by having pulsations going
 through its length from atom to atom, which transmit mechanical
 force from a process of combination which disengages it, to a
 process of decomposition which absorbs force. ' Any heating
  effects, or lighting effects, or magnetic or electrical, or chemical
 work which the wire is made to do are so much resistance to the
  chemical action of the battery, and afford outlets for some of that
  redundant force evolved by its combustions which, if the battery
  were closed by a short thick wire, would go to heating the liquids
  in the cells. You see how the resistance opposed by this plati
  num wire is overcome by the energy of my battery, which forces
  the heavy atoms of this metal to an unaccustomed energy of
  action, more, in fact, when I shorten somewhat the wire, than it
  can bear without fusion; or if I discharge it through the steel
   substance of this short <U+FB01>le, you see how little able is even this
   material to withstand its action in contact with the air. Again,
   ifl discharge it between these carbon points when in contact
   with each other, and then screw them a little asunder, I get a
   luminous discharge from the intensely heated state of the parti
   cles of carbon.
      I must now leave for your consideration this outline of the
   chemical theory of the battery. What we know of the working
   of this wonderful instrument is no doubt very little compared to
   What yet remains to be discovered; and of that little I have de

462         Mr. E. V. Neale on the Numerical Relations of
scribed to you only a very small part, in fact only the foundation
of the edi<U+FB01>ce. If you have any doubts on the subject, I trust
that you will ascribe their existence to the imperfections and
shortcomings of my exposition, and not lay them to the account
of the theory itself.
 LXVI. On the Numerical Relations of the Distances between the
       Planets and Sun. By EDWARD Vansnrraar NEALE*.
     HE great difference between the actual distance of Nep
         tune from the Sun, and the distance at which it ought to
be found, according to what is commonly called Bode’s law, has
naturally produced attempts to find some theory of the planetary
distances more nearly corresponding to the observed facts than
that suggested by Bode. Accordingly, at the last Meeting of the
British Association, Mr. R. S. Browne proposed a scheme ex
pressed by the following Table of proportional distances :—
            Names.                Theoretical distances. Totals. Actual distances.

    Neptune ................ ..      192+ 105-|-58        355        30037
   If we compare these distances with the series derived from
Bode’s law, of 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, 388, or with the
corrected list of numbers constructed upon the principle sug
gested by V. Wurm (see ‘ Kosmos,’ iii. p. 443), i. e. 3'87’, 6'80,
9'73, 15'59, 27"31, 50"75, 9’7'63, 191'39, 378'91, it will be ap
parent that, with exception of the numbers falling to Neptune
and Uranus, these series approximate to the observed distances
more closely than that of Mr. Browne. Therefore his series
cannot be considered as any material improvement on its prede
cessors, though escaping the objection raised to them by Gauss,
that the distance betwen Mercury and the Sun does not harmo
nize with the succeeding parts of the series'_(see ‘ Kosmos,’ p. 444).
Nevertheless Mr. Browne’s system suggests a mode of investi
gating the numerical relations subsisting between the distances
of the planets whence more satisfactory results are obtainable.
   In the series suggested by him, the group of planets beyond
the asteroids is distinguished from that within them by the cir

centre being uncertain, since the total number is not known.

            t/ze Distances between the Planets and Sun.        463
cumstance that, to obtain an approximation to the observed
distance of any planet comprised in the outer group, we must
employ the theoretical distances of the three planets last prece
ding; while to obtain a similar approximation in the inner group,
we require the theoretical distances of the two last preceding
planets only.
    It would seem, then, that the law regulating the distances
between the planets in the two groups changes in passing from
the one group to the other; so that, to discover its nature, it
would appear desirable to take the asteroids as the starting-point,
and examine the relations of distance between the inner and outer
planets separately. Thus we obtain the following results.
Beginning at Mercury, we have for the comparative distances
of the inner group of planets from that planet these numbers:
Venus, 3'36; Earth, 5'13; Mars, 1137; Juno, 2283. Again,
beginning at Juno, we have for the comparative distances of the
outer group of planets from that planet-—Jupiter, 25'33 ; Saturn,
68'69; Uranus, 165'12; Neptune, 273'67.
    At <U+FB01>rst sight these numbers are not promising. Except that
the distance between Juno and Jupiter is not far different from
the total distance between Juno and Mercury, there appears -
nothing like a law of progression in either series. However, we
must consider that if the distances between the planets are
governed by any law of symmetry, it is highly improbable that
this law should be directly observable. If, as many concurrent
arguments indicate, the solar system has arisen out of the gra
dual consolidation of a mass of material formerly diffused over
the whole area now occupied by the orbits of the planets, what
ever symmetry exists between their respective distances must
belong to the distribution of the original centres of aggregation
whereby the planets have been produced, and concern the primi
tive, not the present position of these bodies. So that a theory
which exhibits this symmetry must be one which can account
for the present ‘places of the planets by means of the probable
changes in their original arrangement due to the consolidation
 of the constitutive mass. Now these changes may be expected
to occur in the following order :
    1. Since the consolidation depends upon the attraction exer
cised by the central mass upon its outer portions, the <U+FB01>rst act
must be to draw these parts nearer to the centre.
    2. The differences of pressure produced by the effort of the
 outer particles to approach the centre would give rise to a rota
 tion of the whole mass, and thus throw its equatorial portion
 further from the centre.
    3. When the consolidation       became considerable, a great
 amount of heat would be developed from the collisions of the

464        Mr. E. V. Neale on the Numerical Relations of
particles with each other, and thus an additional expansive ten
dency would be produced.
   If we suppose a number of centres of planetary aggregation to
-be symmetrically distributed through a mass subjected to these
in<U+FB02>uences, the following results appear probable :—
   1. The outermost centre of aggregation might probably be
brought somewhat nearer to the common centre than the position
due to its symmetrical place.
   2. The succeeding centres would be thrown to a somewhat
greater distance than their normal places, through the rotatory
movement of the mass.
   3. On the other hand, these centres would be continually
 urged nearer to the common centre by the pressures exerted upon
them through the matter arrested by them in its progress ‘inwards ;
 so that the more central bodies might probably be ultimately
found nearly in their original relative position in consequence of
the counteraction of these two forces.
   4. Any centres of aggregation so near to the general centre
as to be materially affected by the expansive force of the heat
there generated, may be expected to be repelled beyond their
normal position towards the exterior.
   The problem therefore becomes this: To <U+FB01>nd such an hypo
thetical symmetrical arrangement of the primitive planetary
centres as will probably account for the present relations of dis
tancc observed among the planets after they have been subjected
to the in<U+FB02>uences above traced. Such an arrangement appears to
be supplied, if, taking the numbers 2 and 3 for the basis of the
system, we suppose that the relative positions of the inner and
outer groups of planets were originally determined by the repec
tive series following :—
      I. Inner group . . 2; 2x3; 2x6; 2X12.
     II. Outer group . . 24:; 24x3; 24x6 24X 12.
The normal distances of the several planets on this hypothesis,
with the changes produced in them by the process of consolida
tion, are shown in the following Table :—

              the Distances between the Planets and Sun.       465
It will be seen that this Table corresponds to our anticipa
tions, except in the case of Saturn, where the difference is —
instead of +, and of the Earth, which is nearer to the Sun
than we should expect from the relative distances of Mars and
Venus. But in both these cases a probable explanation of the
anomaly is supplied by the circumstance of these planets re
spectively possessing a greater amount of satellitary attendance
than their companions. If the satellites have been formed
during the consolidation of their primaries, it must be supposed
that there was something in the masses composing the Earth
and Saturn giving them a greater tendency to throw off satel
lites than that belonging to their neighbours. It is probable
that this something was connected with a greater spheroidicity
in the form of the consolidating masses. Hence, since every
planetary mass must for a long time have moved in a medium
offering a considerable resistance, the form of the masses which
 have produced Saturn and the Earth would retard their move
 ments more than those of their more spherical companions, and
thus diminish the relative magnitude of their orbits.
   Thus the anomalies in the distances of Saturn and the Earth
strengthen instead of embarrassing the hypothesis suggested,
being such as, from the peculiarities of these planets, must be
expected to exist if the hypothesis be true. It remains to explain
the position of Mercury. Now, since the distance from Mercury
to Juno is, according to the theory, one-twelfth of that from
Juno to Neptune, the symmetry of the system requires that the
distance between Mercury and the Sun should be one-twelfth
of that between Mercury and Juno. But if the great extension
of the orbit of Venus beyond that theoretically assigned to this
planet is due to the expansive force of the heat produced during
the latter stages of the process of solar condensation, the orbit
of Mercury ought to show a still greater expansion, as is the
case. For while, according to the theory, the normal place of Mer
cury is represented by 2, its actual place is represented by 3'87,
equal to an expansion of 93 per cent. Thus do theory and ob
servation again accord.
   I subjoin a Table exhibiting the distances of each planet from
the Sun according to the theory and to observation, and the dif
ferences between the two sets of places in terms of the Earth’s
radius, and in those of the theoretical radio for each planet,—the
proportions stated above being considerably modi<U+FB01>ed when the
orbit of Mercury is taken into account, in consequence of its great
expansion.                       '

LXVII. The Theory of Double Refraction on the Untlulatory
    Hypothesis of Light. By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S.,
    F.R.A.S.1'
         HE phenomena of light, viewed with reference to the hypo
          thesis of undulations, range themselves naturally in two
classes——those which depend only on properties and motions of
the medium in which the light is generated and transmitted, and
on its immediate action on the organ of sight, and those which
in addition depend on particular relations of the motions and dy
namical action of the medium to visible and tangible substances.
In an article in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1862,
I have given explanations of various phenomena of the <U+FB01>rst
class, by referring them to laws and properties, mathematically
investigated, of the small undulations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid the
pressure of which is proportional to the density. I propose now
to enter upon the consideration of a phenomenon of the second
 class, that of Double Refraction in crystals. The theory of such
 a phenomenon necessarily rests on hypotheses respecting the qua
lities and constituency of the refracting medium, as well as on
 those relating to the aether. In the adoption of both kinds of
 hypotheses, the ultimate conceptions respecting matter and force,
 for which a priori reasons were given in my article in the Octo
 ber Number, will be strictly adhered to. In fact the pheno
    * Astronomers appear still uncertain whether the distance of Neptune
 from the Sun is not somewhat greater than that here attributed to it. If
 it be, the relation of position indicated here may require to be diminished.
 But even if it were converted from + into +, the theory would not be
 affected. The result would show only that in the case of Neptune, as in
 that of Uranus, the movement from the centre had predominated over that
 to the centre.
    '1‘ Communicated by the Author.

               on the Umlulatory Hypothesis of Light.           467
menon of double refraction has been selected for present consi
deration because the theory Ipropose to give of it will be a good
exempli<U+FB01>cation of the principles maintained in that communica
tion.
    In the article just mentioned the ultimate properties of matter
and force are deduced, conformably with a rule of philosophizing
laid down by Newton, from the indications of sensation and ex
perience. Being so deduced they are perfectly comprehensible,
and, if Newton's rule be good, may be regarded as necessary
foundations of physical science. The hypotheses of the follow
ing theory, being framed in accordance with these fundamental
conceptions, will be treated as true hypotheses, from which by
right and su<U+FB02>icient reasoning the explanations of the phenomena
necessarily result. Those physicists, however, who are not pre
pared to admit the validity of the it priori reasoning, cannot
 refuse to accept as mere hypotheses the ultimate properties which
 were reached by it, and as capable of being proved to be true by
 a suf<U+FB01>cient amount of accordance with experiment of results de
 duced from them mathematically. I shall be content if their
truth be considered to rest solely on this kind of evidence.
    Now, in the <U+FB01>rst place, since on these principles the aether is
to be regarded as a continuous <U+FB02>uid which presses proportionally
to its density, and as experiments indicate that light has the same
 properties and is subject to the same laws under very different
 circumstances of original generation, those movements of the
 aether are admissible as exponents of phenomena of light, which
can be mathematically shown to exist in such a medium inde
 pendently of the particular nature of the disturbance. The in
 vestigation of such movements is therefore a necessary prelimi
 nary. This requisite I consider to be fully satis<U+FB01>ed by the ma
 thematical theory of the vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid contained
 in the Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine for June, Au
 gust, and October 1862.
    Again, because, according to the same principles, the azther is
a uniform <U+FB02>uid, and all the natural forces are modes of its action,
its density must be the same within as without the refracting
medium, there being no active force resident in the atoms of the
medium to produce any alteration of the density. Also, because
our principles led to the conclusion that the constituents of vi
sible and tangible substances are inert spherical atoms of con
stant magnitude, the modi<U+FB01>cations which vibratory movements
.of the aether undergo when they pass from vacuum into a re
fracting medium, can only be due to the obstacles presented by
the atoms to the free motion of the aether ; and the effect of
these obstacles will depend on the form, magnitudes, and ar
rangement of the atoms, on the number in a given space, and on

468        Prof. Challis on the Theory of Double Refraction
their motion relative to the motion of the aather. Hence the se
cond principal requisite in a theory of double refraction is to
determine in what manner the aetherial undulations are modi<U+FB01>ed
by these circumstances. But here it must be remarked that
such data cannot be had in the present state of physical science,
so far as regards the magnitudes and arrangement of the atoms,
and the number in a given space. We must therefore com
mence with a general and initiatory solution, not requiring these
particular data,-—and the rather so because there is reason to
 expect that such a solution may be one means of gaining an in
 sight into the interior constitution of crystalline bodies, and thus
obtaining eventually the more precise data.
    Before proceeding to the theory of the changes which light
 undergoes after intromittence into a refracting medium, it will
 be proper to state brie<U+FB02>y those characteristics of aatherial rays
and waves which have been ascertained by mathematical investi
 gation. For more complete information on this head, recourse
 may be had to the before-mentioned article in the Number of the
 Philosophical Magazine for December 1862. The principal
 results bearing on the present question are the following. Pre
 vious to the supposition of any instance of disturbance of the
 <U+FB02>uid, it is found that the di<U+FB01>erential equations of hydrodynamics
 are satis<U+FB01>ed to the <U+FB01>rst order of approximation by vibratory mo
 tion having these characteristics :—The motion is symmetrically
 disposed about a rectilinear axis, so as to be at each instant a
 function of the distance from the axis in any plane cutting it at
 right angles. This axis of the motion being taken for the axis
-of 2, let V be the velocity transverse to the axis, and w the ve
 locity parallel to it, at a point distant from it by r, and let the
 pressure at the same point be a9(1 +0"). Then the values of V,
 w, and cr, to the <U+FB01>rst approximation, are determined by the equa

 As these results were obtained independently of any speci<U+FB01>c
 disturbance, we may conclude that they apply in all cases of
 arbitrary disturbance, and that every instance of vibratory mo
 tion is initially composed of motions de<U+FB01>ned by the foregoing
 equations. Since, also, they were deduced from linear differen
 tial equations with constant coefficients, to satisfy this condition
 we have at disposal an unlimited number of such motions, with

               on the Undulatory Hypothesis ofLight.             469
arbitrary directions of the axes, and arbitrary values of m, 7t, and
c. A discussion of the function f, contained in art. 30 of the
communication in the Philosophical Magazine for August
1862, shows that there are positions of maximum condensation
and no transverse velocity, alternating with positions of no con
densation and maximum transverse velocity, at <U+FB01>xed distances
from the axis, and that the maximum condensations and ve
locities-are continually less as the distances from the axis are
greater. From these preliminaries we may proceed to the con
sideration of a case of motion bearing on the immediate object
of this inquiry.
   Let us conceive the <U+FB02>uid to be put in motion by a plane sur
face of inde<U+FB01>nite extent, vibrating perpendicularly to its plane
according to the law of the sine of a circular are. It is evident
that the resulting motion of the <U+FB02>uid will be wholly in lines
perpendicular to the disturbing surface. But, from what has
just been argued, the motion is still composed of motions de<U+FB01>ned
by the foregoing equations. Hence, to satisfy the conditions of
the disturbance, these component motions must be unlimited
in number and in the same phase of vibration, and their axes
must all be perpendicular to the disturbing plane and be re
gularly distributed relatively to that plane. For under these
circumstances there will be no reason why the transverse mo
tion at a given point should be in one direction rather than
 another, and consequently the transverse motions will be de
 stroyed. If we now conceive the <U+FB02>uid to be bounded by a plane
 of unlimited extent, and a certain limited portion of it to vibrate
in the manner above speci<U+FB01>ed, there will be transverse motions
 to certain distances within and without the geometrical boundary
 of the disturbance. But from the above-stated properties of the
 function f, it may be seen that this motion will be restricted
 within very narrow limits. For since the number of the axes of
 the component motionswithin the geometrical boundary is unli
 mitedly great, at points very little distant from the boundary on
 the outside the sum of the condensations cannot sensibly differ
 from the sum of the rarefactions, and beyond that distance there
 can be no sensible motion ; whilst at like distances within the
 boundary there will on the same account be no reason for a
 transverse motion in one direction rather than in another, and
 the motion will thus be wholly longitudinal. These considera
 tions enable us to perceive why the vibrations of an elastic <U+FB02>uid
 do not spread inde<U+FB01>nitely at their lateral boundaries, and why
 a slender cylindrical portion of light may be propagated through
 space to an unlimited distance.
    If the plane vibrated according to any other law, provided
 there be no motion of translation, the motion may be regarded

  47O       Prof. Challis on the Theory of Double Refraction
  as composed of motions obeying the law of the circular sine, and
  the above reasoning, being applicable to the motions taken sepa
  rately, applies also, on the principle of the coexistence of small
  vibrations, to the total motion. Qn this account, in the subse
  quent reasoning the initial waves will be supposed to constitute
  a single series de<U+FB01>ned by the law of the sine of a circular arc,
  and having a constant value of A.
     Let now a series of waves, generated as above supposed, be
  intromitted within a refracting substance, the surface on which
  they are incident being a plane parallel to the front of the waves.
  It may here be stated at once that, with the view of simplifying
  the present inquiry, I shall not enter upon the theories of re
  <U+FB02>exion and refraction at the surfaces of diaphanous bodies, these
  being questions which may be treated apart from that of the
 laws of transmission within the bodies. For the same reason I
  shall disregard the small difference between the intensities of the
 light before and after intromittence, caused by re<U+FB02>exion at the
 surface. This being understood, it will be assumed to be a ne
 cessary condition of diaphaneity, that the effect of the presence
 of the atoms of the body is simply to diminish in a constant
 ratio the accelerative force due to the actual gradations of the
 density of the tether. That is, dp being the change of the den
 sity p corresponding to the change ds of a line s drawn in the
 positive direction of the motion, if the accelerative force without
 the body he —aQdP, the force within is—M        -2    for the same
                   pds                              ds
 values of p, lip, and uls, the ratio of b to a being constant and
 less than unity.
    In the present state of physical science we do not know by
 what difference of atomic constitution, or arrangement, a dia
 phanous body is distinguished from an opake one. It is only
 known that the condition of diaphaneity is of a very critical
 nature, and that the complete opacity of a substance, or its opa
city to certain rays, appears in many cases dependent on ingre
dients in its composition which bear a very small proportion to
 the rest of the components. With respect, however, to the
movement and condensation of the aether, it is certain that the
above-stated condition must be ful<U+FB01>lled ; and I shall now endea
vour to show, by taking account of the spherical form of the
atoms, in what manner it may he ful<U+FB01>lled.       Conceive, at <U+FB01>rst, a
series of waves after intromittence within the diaphanous body,
to impinge upon one of its atoms supposed <U+FB01>xed. What under
these circumstances will be the distribution of condensation about
the surface of the atom, and the amount and law of variation of
the re<U+FB02>ected velocity? Respecting the distribution of conden
sation (which is the subject of express treatment in the “Mathe

                 on the Undulatory Hypothesis of Liyhti          471
matical Theory of Attractive Forces” contained in the Philosophi
cal Magazine for November 1859), it will suffice for the present
purpose to say that it must be symmetrically distributed about
a straight line drawn in the direction of propagation through the
centre of the atom, that, in the case of waves of the magnitude
of those with which we are concerned in phenomena of light, the
excess of condensation, or rarefaction, is always on the hemisphe
 rical surface on which the waves directly impinge, and that this
 excess is proportional to the incident condensation or rarefaction.
 Hence the atom is continually urged in the direction of propa
 gation by a force which, to the degree of approximation with
 which we propose to conduct this research, is proportional to the
 condensation, and consequently to the velocity of the incident
 waves. We will suppose this force to be
                         km sin %- (bt—.2."+c),
 b being the velocity of propagation in the diaphanous medium.
     In the foregoing reasoning it has been assumed that the atoms
 of the medium are absolutely <U+FB01>xed. But according to our hypo
  thesis of the atomic constitution of bodies, the atoms are retained
  in positions of stable equilibrium by the action of attractive and
  repulsive forces. They will consequently be susceptible of move
  ment by the action of any extraneous force. This mobility of
  the atoms will plainly have an effect on the amount of their re
  tardation of the movements of the aetherial waves. For the com
  plete investigation of this retardation we ought, consequently, to
  be acquainted with the laws and mode of action of the forces
  which keep the atoms in equilibrium. The Theory of Molecular
  Forces, of which I have explained the principles in the Philoso
  phical Magazine for February 1860, might, if fully carried out,
   furnish these data. The present investigation will, however, be
  conducted so as not to require a precise knowledge of the laws
   of molecular forces, but only the admissible assumption that, as
   each atom is acted upon by equilibrated forces, it will be put in
   motion by the addition of the luminous undulations. We must
   now endeavour to obtain on this assumption a mathematical ex
   pression for the velocity of each atom, in order to ascertain the
   effect of the mobility of the atoms on the rate of transmission of
   the waves.
      We have already found, for the case in which the atoms are
   <U+FB01>xed, the expression
                          km sin    (bt—w + c)
   for the accelerative force, due to the action of the waves, by
   which an atom at the distance at from a <U+FB01>xed plane is urged in
   the direction of the propagation. If the atom be moving with

472         Prof. Challis on the Theory of Double Refraction
 the velocity 3%, it is evident.that a portion of the velocity of the
incident waves equal to this velocity, and the corresponding
portion of the condensation, will be transmitted through the
atom (supposed extremely small) just as if its place were occu
pied by the <U+FB02>uid itself. Consequently the expression for the
accelerative force of the atom due to the waves will in this case
 be
                                27r            11.2
                    k (m sin
                                T                   -
 But, in addition to this force, there will necessarily be brought
into play, by the displacement of the atoms from their positions
 of equilibrium, a force due to the elasticity of the refracting
 medium. Now from the foregoing considerations it may be seen
 that we are not here concerned with the absolute displacement
 of a given atom, but with the relative displacement of adjacent
 atoms, because the accelerative force of elasticity depends only
 on relative displacement. In fact, on account of the large value
 of 7t compared with the mean interval between the atoms, all the
 atoms included between two planes at the distances .z'—A.z' and
 .'t'+A.z* from the origin, will have movements very little different
 from that of the atom at the distance .2, 2A:v being supposed
 very small compared to 7». That being the case, we shall sul<U+FB01>
 ciently take into account the effect of the elasticity of the medium
 on the motion of a given atom, by treating the medium as if it
 were a continuous elastic substance ; and whatever may be the
relation between its pressure (p) and its density (5), for the
very small movements that will have to be considered, the varia
tions of pressure may be assumed to be proportional to the va
 riations of density. Hence, if the elasticity of the medium be
 such that dp=e’d5, we shall have for the accelerative force of the
 atom due to the elasticity.—e* .         But since the movements of
the atoms are governed by the action of the aetherial waves, it
follows that these movements and the accompanying condensa
tions will be propagated uniformly through the medium with the
same velocity as the waves of light—that is, with the velocity 12.
Motion of that kind, as I have shown elsewhere, and as, in fact,
it is easy to verify, must satisfy, without reference to the action
of forces, the equations
                          v=b3=f(a:—bt),
12 being the velocity of a particle of the medium.           Hence it

I may here take occasion to state that so long ago as the year
1830 I attempted to ascertain the motions of an atom of a medium,
resulting from the action of a series of undulations, upon prin
ciples identical with those adopted above, with the exception that
the action of the elasticity of the medium was supposed to depend
on the absolute displacement of the atom instead of the relative
displacement of adjacent atoms. (See the Philosophical Maga
zine for September 1830, p. 169.) In consequence of that sup
position the investigation did not altogether succeed in account
ing for the different refrangibility of the rays of light, which was
its ultimate object. It will presently appear that that problem
may be satisfactorily solved by the integration of the foregoing
differential equation.

 Having arrived at this expression for the relative velocity of the
aether and an atom, we have next to investigate the retarding
 effect of the atoms taken collectively on the undulations of the
 aether. As already explained, the retardation is due to the
 re<U+FB02>exions of velocity from the surfaces of the atoms, the re<U+FB02>exion
 from each atom depending only on the relative velocity of the
 atom and the aether. The total re<U+FB02>ected velocity consists of two
 parts, of which one depends on the new condensation to which
 the reaction of the surface of the atom gives rise, while the other
 is unaccompanied by condensation, being a velocity of the kind
 by which the <U+FB02>uid moves so as to <U+FB01>ll space continuously without
 change of density. The latter part, inasmuch as it ful<U+FB01>ls that
 condition and is due to the reaction of a spherical surface, takes
 place in the directions of the radii produced, and varies with the
 distance according to the law of the inverse square. Also the
 mathematical theory of motion in an elastic <U+FB02>uid tending to or
 from a centre, shows that for all distances from the centre very
 small compared with the breadth of the waves, or the value of 71.,
 the part of the velocity unaccompanied by condensation is very
 much larger than the other part. If, therefore, the velocity V
 be incident on the atom at a point the radius to which makes an
 angle 6 with the direction of incidence, and c be the radius of the
 atom, the velocity at the ditance _r from the centre reckoned on
                                          2
 the produced radius of the point is I-:§— cos 9, r being verysmall
 compared with 7x. Now it is this re<U+FB02>ected velocity which gives
 rise to a retarding force acting always counter to the accelera
 tive force due to the elasticity of the aether. The mode of action
 will be such as follows. Since it is an experimental fact that
 parallel lines, engraven on glass, and separated by intervals less
 than 7\., can be seen with a microscope without the least appear
 ance of discontinuity of the surface of the glass, it follows that
 the mean interval between the atoms must be almost an in<U+FB01>nite
  simal quantity compared with 7t.     Consequently, if we conceive
  a plane to be drawn in the medium parallel to the front of the
  waves, the retarding force at any point of the plane will be due
  not alone to the re<U+FB02>exion of velocity from atoms situated in the
  plane, but also from simultaneous re<U+FB02>exions from atoms situated
  within a certain small distance beyond it in the direction toward
 which the waves are propagated. The limiting distance the
 re<U+FB02>exions beyond which have no sensible effect at the plane, while
 _it is small compared with 1., must at the same time be supposed
 to contain many multiples of the mean interval between the
 atoms. For, considering that in <U+FB02>uids and solids the atoms
 occupy spaces very small in comparison with the intervening
 spaces, unless the re<U+FB02>exions take place from a vast number of

                 on the Undalatory Hypothesis ofLiyht.-i       I      475
atoms contained in a slice of the medium of sensible thickness, ,
their mean effect would be inadequate to produce the observed
"amount of retardation.
     Accordingly the calculation of the total retardation will have
to be made in the following manner. Let the velocity of the
aether at the given distance X from the origin at the time t be
m sin . 2Lt                         .

of propagation, let the velocity be msin T--9 .                   Then, if
we take a slice of the medium such that its limiting planes are
at the distances .z'—§ and .z'+g from the origin, at being very
small, from what is proved above the mean relative velocity of
the aether and the atoms will be
                       mCOS¢S1Il.        b
                                      27rTt—9+¢),
 and to this quantity the mean of the re<U+FB02>ected velocities will be
 proportional. We may therefore suppose that the retarding
 effect of the re<U+FB01>exions, from all the atoms of the slice is, at the
 given distance X,
                      ham cos qb sin (37%? — 6 + ¢),
 the coefficient h being a function of .z'—X. If the whole of
 that portion of the medium from the atoms of which the re
 <U+FB02>exions are effective at the same distance X be divided into like
 slices, the total retardation may be represented by the summation
                    2 . ham cos¢sin   . 2-;-’—t—9+¢),

  This may consequently be taken to be the amount of the retar
  dation which the acther suffers at the position where the velocity
  is msin           But the condition of diaphaneity, before stated,
 _requires that this retardation should have a constant ratio to the
  actual velocity of the aether. That this may be the case we must
  have -0’ +¢=0, which equation may be considered to be the

     It results from the preceding reasoning that K cos gb is the
 ratio of the retarding force of the atoms to the actual accelera

 force due to the actual variations of density, diminished by the

Since ea, which measures the elasticity of the refracting medium,
is extremely small compared with aa, which measures the clas
ticity of the acther, and since we have shown that Q is a nega

is negative. Hence, the variations of e92 and y. having opposite
signs, the greater the elasticity of the medium the less the refrac
tive index, and therefore the greater the velocity of propagation
in the medium.                               ~
    From the foregoing argument we may conclude generally, that
the velocity of transmission of light in any diaphanous medium
depends in part on the elasticity of the medium.
    But experiments have been considered to indicate that the
elasticity of certain crystals is different in different directions;
and it may reasonably be supposed that this is generally the case
in regularly crystallized bodies. We have therefore now to
inquire what effect this circumstance may have on the trans
 mission of light in crystals. In the <U+FB01>rst place, from the facts of
 crystallography it may be presumed that the elasticity isin some
 manner connected with atomic arrangement. It does not seem
 possible to account for planes of cleavage on any other principle.
 If, then, the atomic arrangement should be such as to be sym
 metrical about any straight line drawn parallel to a <U+FB01>xed direc
 tion in the crystal, it seems to be a necessary consequence that
 the elasticity of the crystal will be the same in all directions
 perpendicular to that line.          For instance, in a uniaxal crystal,
 as Iceland spar, the elasticities in directions perpendicular to the
 crystallographical axis would all be equal. But it is allowable
 to make a more comprehensive supposition respecting the atomic
 arrangement. Vve may suppose it to be symmetrical with respect
 to three planes drawn always parallel to three <U+FB01>xed planes at
 right angles to each other in the crystal. Taking the intersec
 tion of the planes for the axes of coordinates, if a surface be
 described such that a radius vector drawn in any direction from
 the origin represents the elasticity of the crystal in that direction,
  the above-mentioned condition of symmetry of atomic arrange
 ment would require the equation of this surface to be of the form
 Z’=f(.z@, y’). Hence, as the elasticity (e’) is a function of the
 radius vector (1), we have
                      e*=¢(w*+r+/(we. ya)
 This equality shows that e may have a maximum or minimum

The equations given by equating to zero the right-hand sides of
these equalities are respectively satis<U+FB01>ed by .z'=O and y=O,
showing that the elasticity in the direction of the_axis of z is a
maximum or minimum. The same is evidently the case with
respect to the other two axes. As these results hav_e been ob
tained independently of the forms and values of the functions 4p
and f, it appears that every crystal which satis<U+FB01>es the assumed
law of symmetrical atomic arrangement has three axes of maxi
mum or minimum elasticity at right angles to each other.
   Next let the coef<U+FB01>cients of elasticity in the directions of the
three axes of w, y, .r be respectively cf, e2’, es”, and such that
the force which is produced by a given relative displacement of
the atoms in the direction of an axis is equal to the coe<U+FB01>icient
 x displacement. We have now to <U+FB01>nd the coef<U+FB01>cient of elasticity
for any direction making the angles a, B, y with the axes. For
this purpose we shall regard, as heretofore, the crystalline medium
as consisting of discrete atoms held in positions of stable equili
brium by attractive and repulsive forces, and shall assume that,
according to the law of the coexistence of small vibrations, each
atom can perform independently simultaneous oscillations in dif
ferent directions in obedience to simultaneous disturbances. On
this principle we may consider an actual displacement (Sv) in the
given direction to be the resultant of the three displacements
8v cos oz, 31: cos ,8, Bo cosy in the directions of the axes. Now
these displacements, by hypothesis, give rise to forces in the
directions of the axes equal to efx 3v cos a, efx dvcos B,
(2; x 31: cos y. And it has already been explained that the forces
which these expressions represent are due to condensations of
the crystal considered as a continuous substance, and are not in
kind different from the forces we are concerned with in ordinary
mechanics.       On this account these forces, and also the force due
to the original displacement, take effect wholly in the directions
of the displacements. For the same reason, the three forces in
the directions of the axes may be resolved in the direction of the
original displacement, and the sum of the resolved parts, viz.
                (cf cos2 0: + ef cos” ,8 + e,2 cos2 y) x 8v,
being the total force in that direction, must be equal to the force
due to the original displacement. If, therefore, ea be the coe<U+FB02>i
cient of elasticity for the given direction, we shall have
                e” = cf cos’ a + of cos"2 B + ea“2 cos52 y. . . . (B)
   Reverting again to the equation (a), it is important to remark
that for a ray having a given value of 7t in vacuum, which for
brevity we shall call a ray of given colour, the product A41. is con
stant; that is, if 7&0 be the value of 7t in vacuum, we shall have
for the ‘same colour in a medium 7to=7t,u.. The reason for this

law will appear by considering that when a series of waves enters
perpendicularly into a refracting medium, the ratio of the breadth
occupied by a given number (n) of waves without the medium to
that occupied by the same number within, is equal to p ; so that
n7\,0=n7t;1.. Hence the rays of given colour propagated in differ
ent directions in a crystalline medium will all have the same
value of 7t,u.. Taking this into account, and substituting for g
from the equality k=q (1— ‘lg , it will be found that the.

 account of the small ratio of this quantity to a’. The factors A
 and B are altogether independent of ,u. and e”.

 depend both on the obstacles presented to its free motion by the

 the apparent elasticity of the mther in the directions of the axes

 This equation we shall afterwards cite by its usual appellation,-.
 the equation of elasticity.                                   ,         ,
      We come now to a critical part of our theory, by which it is.
 distinguished from all other attempts to solve the same problem.
  Although the above equation gives the effective elasticity of the_
  aether in any direction in the crystal, we cannot immediately_
 infer from it the velocity of propagation of a plane wave, because,‘
  a_sI have shown from hydrodynamical principles, the composite
  character of the wave must be taken into account. The effect
  this circumstance has on the velocity of propagation may be de.
  termined by the following considerations. First, it is clear that
  the-‘wave cannot be composed of ray-undulations the transverse
  motions of which are the same in all directions from the axis,-_

48O       Prof. -Challis on the '1'lzeory of Double Refraction
inasmuch as this condition cannot be generally ful<U+FB01>lled, because
the effective elasticity is different in different directions. But
such ray-undulations are the exponents of common light. Hence
it follows that common light cannot be transmitted through any
substance the elasticity of which varies with direction, and there
fore it is incapable of transmission through a doubly refracting
medium, of which the change of elasticity with direction is an
essential property. This inference is conformable with experience.
But a polarized ray is transmitted through such substances. In
order to give a theoretical reason for this fact of observation, it
will be necessary to recur to the analytical expressions, appli
cable to ray-undulations, contained in the early part of this com
munication. The value of the function f there given being
obtained without reference to an arbitrary disturbance, de<U+FB01>nes the
law of transverse velocity and transverse variation of density in
rays which have undergone no modi<U+FB01>cation subsequent to their
original production, which are always ‘rays of common light.
But I have shown under Prop. X. in the Philosophical Magazine
for December 1852, that the value off is determined generally
by integrating the partial differential equation
                        119    J9
                       dg + +41-f=0:
in which e is a certain constant satisfying the equation e7..2=4.
The integrals, however, of this equation are subject to the limi
tation of applying only to modi<U+FB01>cations which-the original rays
may receive by successive disturbances. We may presume,
because this equation is linear with constant coe<U+FB01>icients, that all
the parts into which an original ray-undulation may be resolved
will by recomposition form the original ray, and that, too, with
out restriction of the values of .1: and 3/. But we are not now
concerned with movements and con_densations at considerable
distances from the axes, which only perform the part of prevent
ing the lateral diffusion of the waves, but with those that are ex
tremely near the axes, which alone are productive of the sensation
of light. Respecting these, it is proved in the article just referred
to, that an original ray is resolvable into two equal rays polarized
 in planes at right angles to each other, and that the transverse
vibrations in each polarized ray, as also the condensations, are
symmetrical with reference to the <U+FB01>xed plane coincident with the
axis, to which the motion is perpendicular.
   This being understood, suppose a polarized ray to be propa
gated in any -direction from the centre of the surface of elasticity,
and conceive this surface to be cut by a plane perpendicular to
the direction of propagation. -The section will be an ellipse, of
which the radius-vectors drawn from the centre are proportional
to the effective elasticities of the aether in their respective direc

                  an the Undulatory Hypothesis of Light.           481
  tions. In two directions at right angles to each other, corre
  sponding to the axes of the ellipse, the effective elasticities will
  be at a maximum or minimum, and through a small variation of
  direction may be considered to be uniform. Consequently in
  these two directions the transverse motions of a polarized ray
  can take place without disturbance; and accordingly rays whose
  transverse motions are in, and parallel to, either of the two planes
  which pass through the centre of the surface of elasticity and the
  axes of the elliptic section, can be transmitted in the crystal.
      It remains to show that the velocity of propagation of each
  ray depends exclusively on the e<U+FB01>'cetive elasticity in the direction
  of the elliptic axis which coincides in direction with its trans
  verse motions. We have seen that ,u.7t is constant for a ray of
  given colour. Any cause, therefore, that augments or diminishes
  7t, will diminish or augment ,4».      Also since the quantity of
  matter in the condensed part of a wave, exceeding that which
  would occupy the same space in the quiescent state of the <U+FB02>uid,
  must under all circumstances be constant for a given wave, any
  cause which augments the condensations along the axis of the
   my will proportionally diminish 7t and increase 1.4.. If the effec
  tive elasticity in the direction of the transverse vibrations be the
   same as that along the axis, the rate of propagation of the ray
   will plainly be determined by that elasticity. But if the trans
   verse elasticity be altered in any proportion, the effect on the
   transverse condensations must be to alter them in the inverse
   proportion. For instance, if the transverse elasticity be increased, _
   the transverse condensations will be proportionally diminished,
   the accession of elasticity being equivalent to the accelerative
   force lost by the diminution of the gradations of density. But
   the transverse condensations cannot be diminished without a like
   diminution of the condensations estimated along and parallel to
   the axis. Hence, from what is said above, 7» will be propor
   tionally increased, and p. proportionally diminished. Thus y.
    depends wholly on the transverse velocity.
       It is unnecessary, after arriving at this point, to go through
    the analytical process for <U+FB01>nding the equation of the wave-sur
    face, as I have given it in a paper “On Double Refraction”
. contained in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (vol.
 ' viii. part 4), and the process is otherwise well known. Respect
    ing the theory of double refraction attempted in that paper, I
    may here state that it rests fundamentally on the same principles
    as the present one, but in the details of thejargument is not so
    complete. I will now only add two deductions from the theory.
       (1) An optical axis is de<U+FB01>ned to be such that the section of
    the surface of elasticity by a plane at right angles to it is a
    circle. Hence, by the foregoing theory, the effective elasticities
    in all directions perpendicular to an optical axis are equal. Con

 482       Prof. Challis on the Theory of Double Refraction
 sequently if a ray be propagated in any principal plane of a uni
 axal or biaxal crystal, and its transverse vibrations be perpendi
 cular to the plane, the velocity of propagation will be the same
 in all directions in the plane, and the ray will obey the ordinary
 law of refraction.
    (2) If the principal plane of a uniaxal crystal be called the
 plane of polarization of the ordinary ray, the transverse motions
are perpendicular to the plane of polarization. This result is in
accordance with that obtained, relatively to a ray completely
polarized by re<U+FB02>exion, at the end of the article “ On the Direc
tion of the Vibrations of a Polarized Bay,” in the Philosophical
Magazine for February 1859.
    I beg to conclude this communication with a few words on
the history of the problem of double refraction. Although
 Fresnel succeeded in obtaining the equation of the wave-surface,
he was himself aware that his theory rested on a defective dyna
mical basis. After stating in his memoir “ On Double Refrac
tion” (Mémoires ole l’Institut,_vol. vii. p. 53), that the mecha
nical theory rests on the two hypotheses, that the luminous
vibrations are transverse, and that the elasticity of a doubly
refracting medium is different in different directions, he adds,
“As to the hypothesis on the nature of the luminous vibrations,
it appears at <U+FB01>rst sight much more di<U+FB01>icult to admit [than the
other], because we do not easily see how transverse vibrations
can be inde<U+FB01>nitely propagated in a <U+FB02>uid. Nevertheless if the
facts which already furnish so many probabilities in favour of the
system of undulations and so many objections against that of
emission, oblige us to recognize this character in the luminous
vibrations, there is more certainty in our referring here to expe
rience than to the notions unhappily too incomplete which the
calculations of geometers have hitherto given us respecting the
vibrations of elastic fluids.” The attempts subsequently made
to supply what was defective in the mechanical theory of double
refraction, were not directed towards improving the mathematical
theory of the motion of <U+FB02>uids, but were based on a hypothetical
isotropic medium of discrete atoms or centres of force, respecting
which we are left in doubt as to the exact relations of its consti
tuents to the aether and to the doubly refracting substance.
These attempts are reviewed at considerable length by Professor
Stokes in his “Report on Double Refraction,” contained in the
Report of the British Association for 1862 (p. 253). After
stating the results of the different theories, he adds, “I may"
perhaps be permitted to express my own belief that the true dyna
mical theory of double refraction has yet to be found.” Then after
adverting to the fact, established by experiment, that a ray polar
ized in a principal plane obeys the ordinary law of refraction, he
remarks, “this simple law,_which ought, one would expect, to.

                 on the Undulatory Hypothesis ofLight.             483
lie on the very surface, as it were, of the true theory of double
refraction, is not indicated it prior-i by most of the rigorous theo
ries which have been advanced to account for the phenomenon.”
I am not aware that it is strictly indicated it priori by any.
     The reproach which Fresnel cast on the mathematical the
 of the motion of <U+FB02>uids I claim to have removed by my hydrody
 namical researches. I have shown that transverse vibrations
 necessarily take place in a <U+FB02>uid the pressure of which varies as
 its density. The problems by the solution of which this result
 is obtained are those which, among others, I referred to in my
 article in the October Number as having the same kind of rela
 tion to general theoretical physics, as the dynamical problems.
 that Newton solved to physical astronomy. Not only the theory
 of double refraction, but the whole of the undulatory theory of
 light, is placed on an entirely new basis by the discovery of trans
 verse vibrations in an elastic <U+FB02>uid. The explanations of the
 phenomena of dispersion and double refraction given in this
  communication, will, I think, convince any mathematician who
  can be induced to give them su<U+FB02>ieient attention, that the basis
  of the theory must be true. It has this character of truth, that
 it not only explains phenomena, but accounts for the failure, or
  partial success, of previous theories. It shows that Fresnel’s
 theory was true so far as it made the double refraction depend
  on the different apparent elasticities of the aether in different
  directions, but failed in not su<U+FB02>iciently distinguishing between
  the crystalline medium and the aether, and especially in not
  regarding the latter as a continuous <U+FB02>uid. It is wholly on the
  last account that the supporters of Fresnel’s views have not been
  able to show that the usual law of refraction holds good for an
  ordinary ray in a principal plane, nor to determine in an unam
  biguous manner that the direction of the transverse vibrations
  of an ordinary ray is perpendicular to the plane of polarization
  —two results which, as is shown above, are very simply deduced
  from the present theory.
      As this theory has been framed in strict accordance with the
  fundamental hypotheses of Natural Philosophy enunciated (and
   supported by it priori reasoning) in my last communication, and
   as it satisfactorily exempli<U+FB01>es in several important particulars the
   principles there maintained, I take occasion to say, not so much
   with the expectation of receiving credit as for the purpose of
   expressing my conviction of the truth and necessity of the mode‘
   of philosophizing I have so long advocated, that the true theory of
   double refraction no longer remains to be discovered. The same
   assertion may be made with respect to the theory of dispersion,
   the two theories being so intimately connected that they stand
   or fall together.                                     ~       '

    This communication contains the results of some inquiries which
were started by the authors in a previous paper “ On the In<U+FB02>uence
of Temperaure on the Refraction of Light”“". The same apparatus
had been employed, but some modi<U+FB01>cations were introduced in the
method of observation, which are described; and the amount of
probable error from different sources was determined. The liquids
experimented on were either prepared or puri<U+FB01>ed in Dr. Gladstone’!
laboratory, or were specimens reputedto be pure, and lent for the
purpose of this inquiry by Prof. Hofmann, Prof. Williamson, Prof.
Frankland, Drs. \Varren De la Rue and Hugo Miiller, Mr. Buckton,
Dr. Odling, Mr. A. H. Church, Mr. C. Greville Williams, and
Mr. Piesse. The data are collected in two long tables forming two
appendices: the <U+FB01>rst containing the refractive indices of the lines
A, D, and H, of 78 specimens at two or three different temperatures ;
the second, the refractive indices of all the more important lines for
61 of these liquids, and 10 others at the temperature of the room
when the observations were made.
    Five points were investigated, and the following are the results
arrived at with respect to each point.
    I. The relation between the change of refraction (sensitiveness)
 and the change of volume by heat.——The uniform testimony of about
 90 different liquids examined was that both refraction and dispersion
 diminish as the temperature increases.
    The following Table will su<U+FB02>ice as an example, showing as it does
that the di<U+FB02>'erent rays are more sensitive in the order of their
refrangibility :—

    This change of refraction by heat was compared with the known
or ascertained change of volume in bisulphide of carbon, water,
methylic, ethylic, and amylic alcohols, ether, acetone, acetic acid,
formic, acetic, and butyric ethers, methylic and ethylic iodides,

salicylate of methyle,bromoform, benzole, xylole, cumole, nitrobenzole,
hydrate of phenyle, the recti<U+FB01>ed oils of turpentine and Portugal and
eugenic acid, and in every case it was found that the refractive
index minus unity, multiplied by the volume, gave very: nearly a
constant at different temperatures. Now every refractive index
contains at least two coef<U+FB01>cients: the one of refraction, which is repre
sented by the theoretical limit of the spectrum; the other of
dispersion, for which the difference between the refractive indices
 of H and A may be taken as the exponent. The refractive index,
 minus unity (;4— 1), is termed by the authors the “ refractive energy”
 of the substance, and this multiplied by the volume (;1-- 1) x vol ., or
 divided by the density, is termed the “speci<U+FB01>c refractive energy-.”
 It was not found as a rule that the theoretical limit of the spectrum
 gave more truly a constant than the line A; but the difference is
 within experimental errors. The empirical law was therefore ex
  pressed as follows :-—The refractive energy of a liquid varies directly
  with its density under the in<U+FB02>uence of change of temperature, or, in
  other words, the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energy of a liquid is a constant
  not affected by temperature.      Yet the in<U+FB02>uence of dispersion renders
  this not absolutely accurate in the observed numbers, for the change
  of dispersion does not follow the same law, the spectrum contracting
  in some cases much more, and in other cases much less rapidly than
   the volume increases; indeed no relation is as yet discoverable be
   tween the change of dispersion and that of density.
      II. The refraction and dispersion of mixtures of liquids.-—This
   question has engaged the attention of several experimenters, only one
   of whom, however, M. Hoek, has o<U+FB01>'ered a solution.          His formula
   depends on ;r’—l. Yet most of the results recorded were equally
   well explained on the supposition that the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energy
   of a. mixture is the mean of the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energies of its
   components. It was clearly desirable to test this in some cases
   where the refractive indices of the liquids mixed were very wide
   apart. Fortunately, bisulphide of carbon and ether, substances
   almost at the opposite limits of the scale, ‘were found to mix without
   condensation; and another good experiment was obtained with aniline
    and alcohol, on mixing which, however, some diminution of volume
    occurs. In both these cases the experimental numbers were slightly
    below those deduced from the mean of the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energies,
    the discrepancy being beyond the limits of probable error; yet no
    other formula could be devised which would give a nearer approxi
    mation to the indices actually observed.
       III. The refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of oliferent
    members of homologous series.-—Many such series were examined,
    and the results are tabulated, the refractive index of A and the
    length of the spectrum or dispersion being reduced, if necessary,
    to 20° C., and the sensitiveness being taken for the 10 degrees rising
    above 20° C. ; the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energy, dispersion, and sensitive
    ness also form part of the Tables.      Methylic, ethylic, amylic, and
    caprylic alcohols are the <U+FB01>rst series examined, and it is found that on
    ascending the series the refraction increases; the dispersion does so
    still more rapidly, while the sensitiveness remains nearly the same.

  486                                 Royal Society :—
  Other homologous series of the same group, such as the iodides,
  compound ethers, or mercury compounds, were also examined, and
  they all agree in exhibiting a progressive change in refraction and
  dispersion with the advancing members of the series; but in which
  direction and to what extent depend on the other substances with
  which the compound radical is combined. Yet, if we regard not
  the actual indices, but these, minus unity, divided by the density, a
  pretty regular increase is found to take place as the series advance.

     Other groups of homologous bodies were also examined.                             Benzole,

  and no regular progression. Pyridine, picoline, lutidine, and collidine

  diminution of the speci<U+FB01>c dispersion with the advancing series.
  Chinoline and lepidine (which proved to be the most refractive

  just as it does in respect to the boiling-point.
     IV. The refraction, dispersion, and sensitiveness of isomeric
  liquids.--Several of the liquids, isomeric with the different members
  of the benzole series, were examined ; some proved to be identical in
  all optical properties; others sensibly the same in actual refraction
  and dispersion, though slightly diiferent in density; some again

  on the Re<U+FB01>action, Dispersion, and Sergsitiveness ofLiquids.          487
 identical in density, but differing in optical properties; while other
 isomeric bodies differed slightly in each of these respects. Several
 h(ydroearbo'ns of the type C20 H“, from essential oils, seemed to be
 i critical in actual refraction, notwithstanding slight differences of
 their density. In dispersion, too, there were some variations; but
 not in sensitiveness.        Other hydrocarbons, however, of the same
 ultimate composition, but differing considerabl in physical pro
 perties, differed also optically. Compound et ers, as valerianic
 ether and acetate of amyle, which contain the same number) t
 carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen elements, though differently arranged,
  are optically identical, as was partially shown by Del<U+FB01>'s some years
  ago. Aniline and picoline, each empirically C12 H, N, are totally
  different. The conclusion arrived at is that isomeric bodies are
  sometimes widely different in these optical properties; but that in
  many cases, especially where there is close chemical relationship,
  there is identity also In this respect.
       V. The efect of chemical substitution.-——By observing the amount
   of change in the optical pro erties which results from a replacement
   of one element by another, t e chemical type remaining the same, it
   seemed possible to arrive at aknowledge of the in<U+FB02>uence of the
   individual elements on the rays of light transmitted by them. Of
   the immense number of data required for the perfecting of such an
   inquiry, the following are afforded by the experiments already made.
   The replacement of hydrogen by a compound radical, aniline—amyl
   aniline ; and water, alcohol, ether (according to Williamson’s theory).
   Of hydrogen by oxygen—alcohol, acetic acid; ether, acetic ether;
   and carvene, carvole, eugenic acid.       Of hydrogen by peroxide of
   i1itrogen——benzole, nitrobenzole, dinitrobenzole (in solution); gly
   cerine, nitroglycerine; and amylic alcohol, nitrate of amyle.         Of
   hydrogen by chlorine-benzole, ehlorobenzole, terchlorobenzole;
   and the substitution of chlorine by bromine—terchloride of phos
   phorus, terbromide of phosphorus; chloroform, bromoform; and
    bichloride of chlor-ethylene, bibromide of chlor-ethylene, bibromide
    of brom-ethylene. When hydrogen is replaced by some other body,
    there is generally an increase of the actual refraction and dispersion;
    but this is due to the increased weight, hydrogen having a very low
_ actual, but a very high speci<U+FB01>c in<U+FB02>uence on the rays of light. In
    each of the <U+FB01>ve instances of two substitution-products, as, for
    instance, ClIl01'0l)€DZ0l6 and trichlorobenzole, the lower one always
    retains in its optical properties an intermediate position between
    the original substance and the higher product.
        These experiments on substitution sufficed to show, as the exa
    mination of isomeric bodies had done, that the special in<U+FB02>uence
    exerted on the rays of light by the elements of a compound is
    greatly dependent on the manner of their combination.                 ‘

             ON THE OXIDE 013' A NEW METAL :—WAsIUM.
     N examining a Swedish mineral containing silica, alumina, yttria,
     oxide of iron, cerium,didymium, lime,manganese,and several other
 metals or metallic oxides, M. J. F. Bahr observed what appeared to
 be the oxide of a new metal resembling aluminium. The proportion
 of the new metal in the mineral seemed to be not higher than one
 per cent.    For its extraction a very tedious process was employed,
 of which the <U+FB01>rst stage was solution in hydrochloric acid, and one
  of the latter stages precipitation with oxalate of an alkali, which
 throws down oxalate of the oxide of the new metal.    The oxide itself,
 prepared by igniting the oxalate, was a white powder very slightly
 tinged with red. On treatment with nitric acid, the red tinge be
 comes somewhat yellowish, but the oxide seems to be otherwise
 altogether unattaeked by the nitric acid.
    An attempt to prepare an anhydrous chloride by exposing the
 oxide to the conjoint action of charcoal and chlorine did not succeed :
 at any rate no chloride of the new metal could be made to sublime.
    The author proposes to call the new metal Wasium, after the god
 Wasa, and the mineral in which the metal was found Wasite.        The
 symbol proposed is Ws.
    The properties of the oxide are the following. Prepared by igni
 tion of the nitrate, it appears as a brown sandy powder of the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity 3'726. Before the blowpipe, it gives with borax a clear and
 colourless glass, in both oxidizing and reducing <U+FB02>ames ; with micro
 cosmic salt also a clear and colourless bead. Examinations of its
 spectrum were without resu1t.—Poggendor<U+FB01>"s Annalen, 1863, No. 8.
    In the Comptes Remlus for 2nd November of this year, M. T. Nickles
 maintains that the oxide of wasium of M. Bahr is nothing more nor
 less than impureyttria—yttria containing some didymium or terbium.
                    INDIUM, ANOTHER NEW METAL.
    F. Reich and Th. Richter announce a new metal which they have
 found in examining a specimen of arsenical pyrites in the mining
 laboratory of Freiberg. The chloride of indium is volatile, and was
 obtained along with chloride of zinc. The spectrum of the new
 metal contains a line of indigo-blue light more refrangible than the
 strontium blue line. There is a second faint blue line which almost,
 but not quite, coincides with the blue line of potash.
    The reactions of the new metal, which the discoverers call Indium,
 are the following :-Sulphuretted hydrogen does not give any pre
 cipitate in the acid solution of the chloride. Ammonia throws down
 the hydrated oxide from the solution of the chloride.
    The dry chloride of indium is deliqueseent. The oxide of indium
 gives a head of indium when it is ignited with charcoal and soda.
The metal itself gives a yellow sublimate when it is heated before the
blowpipe : this sublimate gives no characteristic reaction with cobalt
 solution.   The metal is lead grey, ductile, and very soft.—J0urnal
fair Pra/ct. Chemie, September 1863.
    Eminent chemists on the Continent consider that indium is not a
de1usiou.—J. A. WANKLYN.

               LXX. On the Formation of Alpine Lakes.
                   By JOHN BALL, M.R.I.A., F.L.S.*
       W0 distinguished Italian geologists, MM. B. Gastaldi and
         G. de Mortillet, have recently published letters'f' in which
they seek to controvert the objections which have been raised to
the theory of the formation of alpine lakes <U+FB01>rst published in 1859
by- the last-named writer.
    M. de Mortillet devotes some pages of his letter to the
discussion of objections to his theory incidentally urged by me
in a paper published in this Journal in the month of February
last. The immediate object of that paper was to controvert views
respecting the former extent of glacial action which had been
advanced in this country by Professors Tyndall and Ramsay;
and to that portion of my argument I understand that both
writers give their assent.        Neither they, nor, so far as I know,
any other of the Swiss or Italian geologists who have studied
this question, believe with Professor Tyndall that glaciers have
been the main agents in the formation of alpine valleys, nor
with Professor Ramsay that they are competent to excavate the
deep rock basins, or troughs, that now contain the lakes of the
Alps.
   As the few observations which I made with reference to
M. de Mortillet’s theory have been evidently misapprehended
by that gentleman, I am anxious. to state rather more fully the
objections which I have to advance, together with some evidence
bearing on the subject that I have recently obtained.
   The broad facts as to which there is a general agreement
amongst those who have discussed this subject are as follows :—
   1. The low country at the south side of the Alps, extending
about 240 miles from the Isonzo to the west of Piedmont, is
covered with a deposit of rolled stones, gravel, and sand, which
has been generally called diluvium, but to which M. de Mortillet
gives the name ancient alluvium.

  490       Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of Alpine Lakes.
     2. Towards the opening of the great alpine valleys the
  diluvium, which extends for a greater or less distance into each
  of them, is found to be composed of rocks derived from the
  mountain-district drained by the valley. At a distance from
  the base of the Alps the materials of the diluvium spread over the
  plain exhibit a mixture of the rocks derived from different valleys.
     3. There is no appearance of any local disturbance of the
  surface throughout the region in question since the deposit of
  the diluvium. The latest changes arising from upheaval of the
  surface must have been completed before that period.
     4. All the main valleys descending from the Alps exhibit
  unequivocal traces of the action of ice. The glaciated surfaces
  of hard rock, the presence of erratic blocks perched upon steep
  slopes, and the remains of great moraines at the lower extremity
  of the valleys, demonstrate the former presence of glaciers, some
  of which must have been of enormous dimensions, perhaps
  exceeding 100 miles in length, and 2000 feet in thickness.
     5. The deposit of the terminal moraines of these ancient
  glaciers must have been subsequent tothat of the diluvium, as in
_ many laces the former may still be seen resting on the latter.
     6. hroughout the central portion of the chain, extending
  from Domo d’Ossola to Riva in the Italian Tyrol, the principal
  valleys of the Alps contain narrow and very deep lakes, all of
  which lie within the area marked by the former action of ice.
      Starting from these data, and rejecting Professor Ramsay’s
  theory of the excavation of the lake-basins by glaciers, MM.
  Mortillet and Gastaldi argue that, as the materials of the
  diluvium are derived from the upper valleys of the Alps, the
  lake-basins must have been <U+FB01>lled up when these materials were
  borne down to the plain of northern Italy. Refusing to admit
  that ice may have been the material that <U+FB01>lled up the lake-beds,
  they hold that the diluvium must itself have performed this
  o<U+FB02>ice, and so bridged over the space that must have been
  traversed before the great masses of diluvial matter can have
  been discharged into the plain. To account for the subsequent
   clearing out of the lake-beds, the glaciers are held to have
   descended into the lower valleys, and scooped out the incoherent
   masses of diluvium from the hollows which, on the subsequent
   retirement of the glaciers, became <U+FB01>lled by the existing lakes.
     This theory leads to two separate branches of inquiry—the one
  mainly physical, the other mainly geological. It may be asked,
  <U+FB01>rst, whether glaciers as mechanical agents are competent to do
  the work which has been attributed to them ; secondly, whether
  the evidence fairly interpreted leads us to seek their agency in
  order to explain the phenomena.
     In discussing the <U+FB01>rst ql1estion—-—that as to the competency

            Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of Ahnine Lakes.         491
of glaciers to excavate deep lake-basins-——it will be convenient
to <U+FB01>x attention upon a single case. The same arguments will
apply, mutatis mutandis, to others. Taking, then, the former
glacier of the Tessin, which descended into the basin now occu
pied by the Lago Maggiore, and leaving out of account the
   ranch of the Toce glacier which entered the lake-basin between
 Pallanza and Baveno, we have the following conditions under
 which the proposed theory must be tested. Admitting that the
 lake-basin has been partly <U+FB01>lled up in modern times, the ancient
 glacier of the Tessin, formed by the union of manyice-streams, of
 which the most important was that <U+FB02>owing from the Val Leventina
 by Faido, reached the level of the lake-basin at or near Bellinzona.
 The distance from Faido to that town is about 23 miles, and in
 that space the bed of the valley falls 1573 feet, so that the average
 slope is little more than 1 in 80. From Bellinzona to the lower
 end of the lake an approximately level bed of diluvium would,
 according to the theory, have extended to the lower end of the
  lake, a distance of 47 miles. The basin or trough containing
  this supposed mass of diluvium is in the form of a long valley,
           most

  sinuous        parthaving
              form,    enclosed            steep walls

                            an average                  of rock,
                                                  of about        very I
                                                            two miles,
  but contracted at one part to about one mile, and enlarged else
  where to a breadth of three miles. The depth of the trough
  throughout a great part of its length considerably exceeds 1500
  feet, but at one point, about 34 miles from Bellinzona, it exceeds
 2600 feet. A rough estimate derived from the ascertained
  depth of the lake gives the probable contents, supposing it <U+FB01>lled
 up to its present level, at from 15 to 20 cubic miles. The
 reader is requested to consider how a glacier, under the circum
 stances here described, could have cleared out this prodigious
  amount of solid matter. It does not appear to me that those
  who have written on the subject have considered the mechanical
  problem at all closely.
     The removal must have been effected, if at all, either by the
  front or tongue of the glacier while it advanced through the
  channel, or else by some forces brought into play when the mass
  of diluvium was covered by that of the glacier. I am willing
  to admit, as I have done in a former paper, that the tongue of
  the advancing glacier would probably have some slight effect in
  removing a super<U+FB01>cial layer of such matter as the diluvium;
  but I see no reason to hold with M. Gastaldi that the effect in
  the case of a gigantic glacier like that in question would be much
  greater than that seen in existing glaciers. There is no reason
  why the tongue of a glacier 100 miles long should be thicker
  than that of one <U+FB01>ve miles long. The thickness depends on the
  relation between the rate of advance of the glacier and the rate

   of melting, and is greatest when a glacier descends rapidly from
   an upper level to a lower one where it encounters a rapid in
   crease of temperature. A glacier that had <U+FB02>owed for 23 miles
   through a nearly level valley would taper gradually to a com
   paratively thin tongue. But the ploughing action of the front
   of a glacier depends, as I believe, much less on the weight of
   the advancing mass than on its tenacity. Glacier-ice, as we
   know, will bend to suit the shape of the rocky channel in which
   it moves; but some considerable force is necessary for the pur-_
   pose, and that force is partly expended against the sides or
   bottom of the channel. Thus it happens that when a glacier
   descends a rapid slope, and then encounters a less inclined sur
   face, the front does exert a considerable ploughing action, and
   shoves before it whatever incoherent masses may stand in its
   way, until it gradually adapts its bed to the new slope on which
   it has to advance *. 1 am relieved from the necessity of insisting
   on the limited power of the front of a glacier to excavate the
   diluvium, because this is implicitly admitted by both my oppo
   nents. M. de M01-tillet has, indeed, been good enough to give
_ several sections showing portions of terminal moraine resting on
   the diluvium, in positions where neighbouring portions of the
  same diluvium must have remained in their present position
   under the advancing front of the glacier. .
      If we abandon the idea that the glacier of the Tessin during
  the period of its advance pushed before it <U+FB01>fteen or twenty cubic
  miles of solid matter that had previously <U+FB01>lled the channel of
  the lake, the next alternative will be to suppose that the glacier
  advanced until it covered over the underlying diluvium, and
  that by some agency, not yet explained, it gradually effected the
  clearing out from the trough of this enormous underlying mass.
      If we had to consider a glacier lying in a valley with a slope
  of, say 5°, over a bed of diluvium a quarter of a mile in thick
  ness, we should infer, from the few observations we possess
  on the retarding eifect of the bed upon the motion of the
  ice, that the motion of the bottom of the glacier would be less
  than half of that of the surface, yet sufficient to exert such a
  grinding action on the subjaoent stratum that in the course of
  ages the whole might possibly be ground down and removed.
  It would be an essential part of the process that, as the mate
 rials were pulverized, the streams <U+FB02>owing beneath the glacier
  would carry them away to some lower level in the form of
     * I am willing to admit that this action, exerted at the base of consider
 able ice-falls, may excavate in the underlying rock basins of slight depth
 compared to the thickness of the glacier, and may thus have produced
 some of the tarns seen in high mountain countries.        But I believe these
 cases to be exceptional and unimportant.

             Mr. J. Ball on the Formatiovi ofAlpine Lakes.         49::
glacial mud or <U+FB01>ne débris. If in this imaginary case the slope
of the supposed valley were reduced successively to 4°, 3°, and
2°, we should <U+FB01>nd that the period necessary for the operation of
removing the vast mass of underlying matter must be prodi
giously increased, as the increasing resistance offered by friction
would diminish to a small fraction the onward motion of the
ice upon its bed. If the slope were but 1°, we should hesitate to
believe in the possibility of such a removal within any calculable
lapse of time. Underlying rocks may be scored and glaciated
 by the under surface of a glacier, though it should advance but
 a few inches in the year; but the destruction and removal of
 vast masses of mineral matter require that the motion by which
 they are effected should be of appreciable amount.
     It is needless to say that the above argument applies with
 still greater force to a glacier supposed to lie on a dead level of
 vast extent. My conviction is that under such circumstances
 the resistance. offered by the bed would be far greater than that
 arising from the internal cohesion of the ice. In such a case
 the upper portions of the glacier would <U+FB02>ow over the inferior
 portions, and the bottom would remain <U+FB01>xed on its bed. Let it
 not be forgotten that in the case of a monstrous glacier lying in
 a level channel 47 miles long, gravity would no longer have the
 least action in urging forwards the lower strata of the ice. The
 only force that we can imagine to act in impelling these forwards,
 would be that arising from the onward motion of the glacier in
 the upper alpine valley before it reached the level channel. But
  before we can admit that pressure can be transmitted through a
 vast mass of glacier-ice su<U+FB02>icient to overcome an enormous re
  sistance, as though the whole were a rigid mass, we must burn
  the observations of Forbes, Agassiz, Tyndall, and other glacier
 inquirers, and forget all the results they have recorded. Pro
 fessor Tyndall found that in one portion of the Mer de Glace a
  slight increase of resistance to the advance of the glacier caused
  the longitudinal compression of a section of the glacier 1000
  yards in length at the rate of 8 inches daily ; and we are asked
  to believe that an enormously greater resistance, spread over a
  space 47 miles in length, would not prevent the transmission of
  force through the lower strata of the ice sufficient to overcome
  the obstacles to its onward movement. Of course the argument
  here offered applies a multo fortiori if We suppose the bed of the
  glacier to be concave, instead of being merely a level surface; but
  there is one further consideration which seems to be, if possible,
  still more conclusive.
      Let us suppose that in the case here chosen for consideration
   the glacier had by some process, to me inconceivable, cleared
   out one cubic mile of the diluvium from the lake-basin, and

494        Mr. J. Hall oh the Formation ofAlpine Lakes.
that it were still enabled to exert some grinding action upon the
remaining mass, which, at the lowest estimate, must have mea
sured 14 cubic miles. By what imaginable means could this
enormous mass of matter have been removed from the hollow
trough in which, by hypothesis, it was contained? In the sup
posed case of a glacier lying in a valley over a stratum of inco
herent materials, the streams formed under the ice would carry
off the triturated materials as fast they were formed; but no
such agency can be admitted here. The stream that would issue
from such a basin would be merely the over<U+FB02>ow of the water
 rising above the margin. My imagination fails to discover any
process by which this could carry off the mineral contents of the
 basin, and continue to do so till this was drained to a depth ex
 ceeding 2600 feet.                     _
    M. de Mortillet seems to suppose that I am not familiar with
 instances where the glaciated condition of the rock shows that
 the under surface of a glacier has ascended over a projecting
 surface. Such cases must be familiar to all alpine travellers,
 and may sometimes be traced in connexion with existing glaciers;
 but to infer from these that the entire mass of a glacier could
 have been urged for miles uphill, with its under surface sliding
 over the bed, is much as if I should conclude that because a
 waggon continues to roll down an incline, although a wheel may
 now and then pass over a stone, the same Waggon might of its
 own accord travel up the incline, where all four wheels must
 ascend at the same time. When the force of gravity acting on
 an entire section of the glacier tends to urge it in the same
 direction as a force acting d tergo, it appears that the tena
 city of the ice is sufficient to carry particular portions over
 convex projections in the bed. But we know from direct ob
servation that the tenacity and rigidity of glacier-ice are con<U+FB01>ned
 within narrow limits; and if the force of gravity acting on a
 considerable section of the glacier were ever to,act in opposition
 to the force it tergo, the ice acted on by these opposing forces
 would necesarily move upwards and outwards in the direction
 of least resistance.
    I am well aware that to many geologists arguments derived
 from mere physical reasoning are not fully satisfactory, and that
 to such minds the observation of facts seeming to have a direct
 bearing on the point in dispute will be more conclusive. On
 this account I desire to mention some observations made during
 the last summer on a speci<U+FB01>c point, as to which M. de Mortillet
 conceived that he had given a satisfactory answer to an objection
 urged by me.
    In the article already referred to, I made the u<U+FB02>iciently
 -obvious remark that if the lake-basins had once been <U+FB01>lled by

             Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of Alpine Lakes.        4195
diluvium, and were subsequently cleared out by glaciers, we
ought to <U+FB01>nd the diluvium still in situ in those portions of the
lake-bed which from local conditions must have been protected
from the advance of the glacier. As an illustration, I referred
somewhat at random to the rocky promontory of Balbianello,
which projects from the west shore of the Lake of Como nearly
at right angles to the general direction of the lake. If the
glacier had descended from the north as a gigantic graving-tool,
and had scooped out the diluvium from the channel of the lake,
the promontory in question would have protected the diluvium
 lying on its south side, and it should still be found there at the
 present time. M. de Mortillet at once accepted my argument
 as a fair test of his theory, and has given what appears to be a
 su<U+FB02>icient answer, by stating that the diluvium, or ancient allu
 vium, is actually to be found in the locality which I had quoted.
 During the last summer I repaired to the place in question with
 the Marchese Giammartino Arconati, who inhabits the well
 known villa on the promontory, provided with about 113 metres,
 or 370 feet, of sounding line.
      It is not necessary that I should give the detail of all the
  soundings made by me on that occasion; but I desire to direct
  attention to four which have the greatest signi<U+FB01>cance. It will
  be su<U+FB02>icient to say that, on sounding from the point of the pro
  montory along its south shore, I found the rocks everywhere
  descend very steeply, apparently at an angle of about 60° with
  the horizon. Not only the steepness of the declivity, but the
  suddenness of the descent from one point to another, bowed
  that we were over ledges of rock rising in a precipice as nearly
   vertical as is commonly found on the steepest face of a limestone
   mountain.
       Having passed rather more than halfway along the southern
   shore of the promontory, we found a slight concavity, or very
   diminutive cove, where lay on a slope, stretching for some yards
   from the water, a small mass of shingle, consisting of waterworn
   stones with a little <U+FB01>ner gravel. This is evidently the diluvium
   referred to by M. de Mortillet, and believed by him to be the
   remains of the vast mass which once <U+FB01>lled the entire basin now
    occupied by the lakes of Como and Lecco. I immediately pro
    ceeded toimake soundings at successive points in a line receding
    from the shore, opposite the shingle bank, measuring the enact
    distam:e=from the shore at which each sounding was made. The
    result gives of courses. rough outline of the vertical section of
    the bed of the lake opposite to this point, and is best seen in the
    annexed diagram, where the distance from the shore and the

<U+FB01>rmatory of M. de Mor
tillet’s assertion, whatever
the explanation of the fact
might be. But the two suc

 with the fact that at a short                                         '
 distance (less than 10 yards) further from the shore no bottom
 was found with 370 feet of line, proved to demonstration that
 the subaqueous precipice is continued along the S. face of the
 promontory, and that the objection originally taken by me sub
 sists in all its force. I may remark that by following along the
 shore to the S.W., towards the hamlet of Campo, any one who
 may repeat the observations will approach the mouth of a stream
which, like every other torrent falling into the lake, pours into it a
 mass of detritus that doubtless forms a conical mound beneath the
level of the lake, not to be confounded with the ancient diluvium.
    With the help of the annexed diagram the explanation of the
 fact noted by M. de Mortillet is sufficiently obvious. On all
 the more level spots surrounding the lake, extending from the
 shore to a height of about 2000 feet, deposits of unrolled or
partially waterworn materials are to be found. These deposits
are formed from rocks existing in situ in the alpine valleys
surrounding the head of the lake, and Were doubtless conveyed
by ice to the spots where we now <U+FB01>nd them. Whether originally
waterworn or not, a deposit of such materials exposed for ages
to the action of the water on the lake-shore would necessarily
be reduced to the condition in which the small shingle-bank in
question was detected by the keen eye of M. de Mortillet, and
pressed into service as a witness for his theory.
    I shall naturally be asked by some who may have followed me
so far, what explanation I have to offer of the relations between
the diluvium and the more recent glacial phenomena on the
south side of the Alps to which M. de Mortillet has called
attention. To this I reply that a complete answer cannot, as
I believe, be given until the whole of the facts shall have been
minutely studied with a degree of care that has not yet been
applied to them, and which indeed would not have been prac
ticable until the nature of the problems to be discussed was
somewhat de<U+FB01>ned.                                                     *

w M. de Mortillet has, if I may venture to sa so, done excellent
service to science by calling attention to the i<U+FB02>iculties that have
to be explained, and by observations, in many of which he has
preceded other inquirers ; but he has proposed an explanation
which seems to me essentially defective, while he has turned his
eyes away fromthe direction whence light might have been shed
on the subject.
    MM. Gastaldi and Mortillet have put aside with little discus‘
sion the belief expressed by me that the distribution of the dilu
vium in the north of Italy, and its relations to the undoubted
remains of glacial action, cannot be accounted for without ad
mitting the presence of the sea in the valley of the Po during
some portion of the glacial period. I have no pretension to
speak dogmatically on the subject, but I may say that my con
viction on this subject has arisen altogether from observations
made during repeated excursions in the southern valleys of the
Alps, and has been more and more con<U+FB01>rmed as I have found
that, although there may not be evidence amounting to direct
demonstration, each new visit to the Alps has added to the list
of observations which are consistent with this belief.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place, this hypothesis has in its favour no tri<U+FB02>ing
amount of it priori probability. There is no evidence whatever
 pointing towards any local disturbance of level in the Alps since
 the miocene period ; it is therefore the more probable that the
 entire chain should have participated in any general change of
 the relative level of land and sea that affected the adjoining
 regions during the later geological period. We have conclusive
 evidence to show that in those islands the sea stood during a
 portion of the glacial period at least 1500 feet higher than it
 now does. We know also that a considerable part of North
 Germany was submerged, as well as a still more extensive region
 in Northern Africa. Leaving out of account other more disputable
 instances of recent change of level, these facts suffice, as I think,
 to create a presumption in favour of the view which I advocate,
  and which, if I mistake not, is supported by the high authority
 of M. Omboni.                                                       '
     One of the main reasons which makes probable the presence
  of the sea in the valley of the P0, is the wide dispersion of the
  diluvium throughout the great plain at the foot of the Alps.
  The diluvium is not merely found at the opening of the main
  valleys that penetrate deeply into the interior of the Alps ; it is
  spread along the base of the entire range, in situations quite out
  of the path of those imaginary currents that are said to have
 swept the rolled débris from the valleys into the plain. In some
  places, as on the plain of Friuli, it is spread out on a dead level
 .in a uniform stratum, without the slightest break, and with

498        Mr. J. Ball on the Formation ofAlpine Lakes.
scarcely a ru<U+FB02>le on its surface. These are effects which no cur
rents of running water are competent to produce. No known
cause, excepting the waves of the sea, or of a great lake beating
on a shallow bed, will spread out shingle in the fashion which
we see in Northern Italy.
    It is supposed that because the diluvium consists of materials
derived from the upper valleys of the Alps, and because it is
composed of waterwom fragments, it must have originally been
conveyed to the plain in the condition in which we see it. The
inference appears to me altogether unnecessary, and, for reasons
presently to be mentioned, very improbable. I believe ice to
have been the main agent for the transport of the diluvium as
well as the moraines, and that its waterworn character is due to
 trituration by wave-action on a shallow shore. Besides the dif
<U+FB01>culty of admitting that currents descending the valleys can
-have coated the plain with a uniform stratum of diluvium, it
 is equally hard to understand how they can have carried the
diluvium across the level lake-basins, supposed to have been
<U+FB01>lled up, so as to reach the plain.      A slope of at least 10 feet
 per mile, or 1 in 500, is necessary to enable a river to transport
 rolled gravel of the ize required. This objection has been per
-haps overstated by Lombardini, but is clearly a serious one.
 We ought to <U+FB01>nd traces of diluvium at a great height about the
 head of each of the greater lakes. No such traces have been
 found. Even if great currents were able to transport and spread
out the diluvium a we now <U+FB01>nd it, which I cannot concede, it
 is not easy to see how such a violent and continuous current as
 is required can have originated in each of the alpine valleys.
 The estimate of rainfall cannot be reasonably increased beyond
 moderate limits ; and;the greater cold of the climate, by increas
  ing the proportion of snow in each fall, would have tended to
  diminish the violence of the current, and to make it more uni
 form in volume. The only cause likely to have acted at all has not
  been pointed out, so far as I know. During the period of increase
  of the glaciers, cases may probably have arisen in which a main
  valley was barred across by a glacier descending from some
  lateral gorge or glen ; and a lake having accumulated behind the
  barrier, this grew until it burst its bounds, and caused a '<U+FB02>ood
  of the same character as the well-known inundation of the
  Dranse in 1818. But such events must have always been of a
  local and accidental character ; it is impossible to look to them
  for the explanation of a phenomenon so vast and so general as
  the transport of the diluvium. In connexion with the pre
  ceding paragraphs, it is worth noting that the Dranse inundation,
  the most considerable event of this kind accurately recorded,
  does not seem to have carried any coarse débris below St.

Maurice in the Valais, none certainly was borne nearly so far as
Villeneuve.
     Several writers on the glacial period seem to have taken it for
granted that very extensive glaciers must have produced streams
vastly more considerable than those that now <U+FB02>ow through the
alpine valleys. A moment’s consideration shows that this is a
mistake, if we admit that whatever climatal changes may have
occurred during the period in question were gradual and not
abrupt. Any other supposition would imply the sudden de~
 struction of most of the existing species of animals and plants.
»-During the period of the increase of the glaciers a part of the
rainfall of each year would have been converted into névé, and
‘conversely, during the period of decrease a corresponding por
tion of glacier-ice would have been annually melted. The
 streams could have been no greater than sufficient to carry off
 the'annual rainfall, diminished in the one case, and increased in
 the other, by the quantity gained or lost by the glacier.
      Believing as I do in the presence of the sea in the valley of
the Po during a portion of the glacial period, I am prepared to
 believe that amongst the effects hitherto attributed to glaciers
 alone, some portion may be due to the action of <U+FB02>oating ice.
  It seems to me highly probable that during the earlier portion
  of that period the sea entered into the main valleys on the
  southern side of the Alps, and that moraine-laden glaciers en
  tering these <U+FB01>ords were <U+FB02>oated down to the open sea, where they
  would rapidly melt, depositing their burdens at the sea-bottom.
  At a later period it seems probable that the sea-level gradually
 ~-fell, while the glaciers advanced and gradually <U+FB01>lled up the lake
  basins, <U+FB01>nally depositing their moraines about the openings of
  the greater valleys. Considering the enormous mass of mineral
  matter brought down during this period, the operation must
  havecovered a vast extent of time ; and analogy would lead me
  to expect that the changes of climate -were not uniform. There
  are indications of halts, during which the glaciers were sta
  tionary, and of oscillations that probably caused their retreat
  and ‘subsequent advance. Theitime necessary for the melting
  of such a mass of ice as would have <U+FB01>lled one of-the great flakes
  isso great, that it is probable that -theymay-Ihave been -partially
   or-entirely occupied by ice after the glacier had retreated to a
  ‘considerable distance in the valley~a'bove'the lake.
       In regard to some of the vast piles of débris that have been
   described as moraines of extinct glaciers, and especially those
  south-of the Lake of Garda, it appears to me that a considerable
  portion -wasiaccumulated by the stranding of ice-raft, or ‘masses
  -of <U+FB02>oating glacier on the shallow sea-bottom opposite-the mouth
  -of the %valley. Some considerable portionsof the mass ‘are <U+FB02>atl

tened out and accurately levelled at the top, in a way altogether
 inconsistent with the idea of their being ordinary moraines left
 in situ by the retiring glacier. It is not allowable to suppose
 that the lake itself, when formed by the melting of the glacier,
can have done this work, unless we admit that at the period
 when the moraine amphitheatre was formed the sea beat upon
 its outer face at a level considerably above the present plain.
 In that case the streams cutting through the terminal moraine
 to give exit to the drainage of the glacier would have gone as
 low as the then sea-level, but no lower; so that at a later period,
 when the sea had retired, and the lake was formed by the melt
 ing of the glacier, this might have been kept at a higher level,
 being held in by the circuit of hills constituting the terminal
 moraine, which would have been gradually cut through by the
 Mincio.      During the interval, the lake, acting on the materials
 lying within the amphitheatre, may have modi<U+FB01>ed their form and
 arrangement, though I think the appearances agree better with
‘the supposition that the level-topped mounds were formed from
 stranded ice-rafts, as already mentioned. If the glacier when at
 its furthest had advanced into the plain, this being formed of
_dry land, the action of the streams issuing from the glacier
 would have kept a channel open, and no bar would have been
 formed by the terminal moraine capable of holding up the level
.of the lake.
    It is only by careful levelling along the banks of the lakes,
_and the alpine valleys connected with them, that it will be pos
 sible to distinguish accurately between the traces of extinct
 glaciers and those of <U+FB02>oating ice. Many peculiarities in the dis
 tribution of erratic blocks and glacial drift in the valleys of the
eastern Alps would lead me to believe that the sea, during some
 part of the glacial period, must have there reached a consider
 able height, approaching, if not exceeding, 1800 feet above the
 present level; but without more complete and more accurate
 observations I place no con<U+FB01>dence in this conclusion.
    I think I have shown in the foregoing pages that the theory
of M. de Mortillet involves a chain of hypotheses each of which
is inadmissible.
    It is not admissible to assume that violent currents existed
in each of the valleys of the Alps, capable of bearing down such
an enormous amount of diluvium as would have <U+FB01>lled up the
great lakes; it is inadmissible to assume that, if such currents
did exist, they could have carried the diluvium along the level
<U+FB02>oor of the lake-basins so as to reach the plain; it is not admis
sible to assume that, if it had reached the plain, it could have
been evenly spread out over the surface by the supposed cur
rents; lastly, it is an assumption entirely inadmissible that the

           Mr. J. Ball on the Fornwtion of -Aihiine Lakes.       501
lake-basins, if <U+FB01>lled with diluvium, could have been cleared out
by glaciers. Whatever may be the true solution of the in-'
teresting problem proposed by M. de Mortillet, that furnished
by him will not, I feel sure, be accepted by geologists.
i I believe that, in indicating the presence of the sea in the
valley of the Po, I have pointed out the quarter whence a true
solution of the difficulty is to be derived. The solitary argu
ment that seems to be relied upon by M. de Mortillet to nega
tive this belief, is the fact that marine remains have not been
discovered in the diluvium. If negative evidence of this nature
were held to be conclusive as to the validity of geological theories,
we should have to alter many of the received doctrines of the
science. Deposits of enormously greater extent than the dilu
vium in the valley of the P0 are universally believed to have
been formed by marine action, although no marine fossils have
yet been identi<U+FB01>ed in them; and it is especially in regard to
strata formed of rolled fragments of hard rock that we should
 expect the destruction of whatever scanty organic remains they
 may once have contained. I may be allowed to cite the follow
 ing facts as illustrative of the small value of negative evidence
 in regard to the very geological period now under discussion.
 The presence of the sea at a considerable height on the moun
 tains in the British Islands during a portion of the glacial
 period is now universally admitted; but no marine remains have
 been found on the lower western slopes of the mountains of
 North Wales, although these must have been in succession por
 tions of the shore during the advance and subsequent retirement
 of the sea. Only in two or three spots, at a height of from
 1200 to 1350 feet, have sea shells been found.       The chief de
 posit, <U+FB01>rst discovered by Mr. Trimmer, is near the summit of
 Moel Tryfaen, a sharp conical peak, where no one would suspect
 its presence. From this locality, as I have been informed by
  Sir Charles Lyell, <U+FB01>fty-six existing species of shells, for the
  most -part Arctic -or northern British, have been extracted,
  while in another spot, where similar remains were detected by
  Professor Ramsay, but few and imperfect fragments have been
 found. When it is remembered that the district in question has
  been over and over diligently examined by careful geologists, the
  absence of organic remains over so wide an area affords a strik
  ing commentary on the value of negative evidence in geology.
     Even though the presence of salt water in the valley of the
  Po during the glacial period were absolutely disproved, this
  .Would not remove the possibility of the existence of an inland
  freshwater sea in the same area, whose physical effects in the
  production and diffusion of the diluvium would have been un
  distinguishable.        -                                           ’

    While correcting the erroneous statements of Sonnini and
others, the labours of Admiral Smyth have veri<U+FB01>ed the existence
of a bar extending from Sicily to the opposite coast of Africa;
and in the Adriatic it is well known that the depth of the bottom
between Otranto and the opposite coast, though considerable, is
much less than either north or south of the “ narrows.” This
is not the occasion for discussing the probability of recent changes
in a region which has long been the seat of intense volcanic ac
tion; it is enough to say that, if the rein be given to speculation,
it may take other directions than that in which it has been set
free by M. de Mortillet.
    The broad facts are simply these, that an enormous quantity
of mineral materials has somehow been transported from the
central portions of the Alps to the valley of the Po; that the
 older part consists of a waterworn deposit spread out over the
 plain, while the newer portion assumes the shape of mounds of
 unrolled or slightly worn materials disposed about the opening
 of the main valleys. All are agreed that these mounds are mo
 raines, partially or exclusively deposited in their present site by
 glaciers which descended the valleys and <U+FB01>lled up the basins of
 the lakes, where such were present in the path of the extinct gla
 ciers. The same vehicle was equall competent to convey the
 materials of the diluvium ; but we have no direct evidence to
 show how this was reduced to its present rolled and waterworn
  condition, nor how it was spread out over the low country.         It
 is only by full discussion of the problems remaining to be solved
  that we are likely to arrive at reliable solutions, and it is to this
 end that I have offered the foregoing remarks.

 occult nature of electricity itself, often vague and unsatisfactory:
 amongst others it has been made to signify an hypothetical elastic
 quality, the electrical agency being supposed capable of changing
 its state or condition——just as we may imagine a spring to have
 greater or less elastic power. M. Dela Rive observes, “ Besides
 the quantity of electricity, it is necessary to know its density,”
 thereby inferring a greater or less degree of what may be termed
 solidi<U+FB01>cation or compactness of particles, and assuming the elec
 trical agency liable to compression or expansion. “ La densité,”
 he observes, “ peut étre déterminée directement an moyen d’un
 électrometre a poids,” that is to say, by an intensity-electrometer.
    Again, Ries,'as also M. Dela Rive, infers that in distributing
a given quantity of electricity over three or four jars instead of
_one jar, its density or elastic force is thereby diminished, and a.
change effected in the quality of the electric agency; they are
_hence led to represent this hypothetical change by the expression
   " At equal distancesfrom the boiling temperatures the elasticities of the
vapours of diferent liquids are for the most part nearly equal. This law
has been found to be approximately true for the vapours of water, alcohol,
ether, and sulphide of carbon.

 ; in which q signi<U+FB01>es the quantity of electricity, and s the
extent of the coating or surface over which it is expanded.
    In like manner it has been commonly observed that in the
construction of voltaic batteries a few large plates principally
relate to quantity; whilst in breaking up those plates into a long
alternating series of smaller ones, we are supposed thereby to
impart to the voltaic currents intensity, or elastic power.
    The term “intensity ” has also not been unfrequently employed
to signify tension, or reactive f0rce—as when a dielectric medium
interposed between metallic coatings becomes ruptured or broken
down by polarized molecular action. It has been employed in
other senses, all of them conveying hypothetical views of the
agency in operation.
    These various interpretations of the term intensity have long
since appeared to me unsound and unsatisfactory, and unsub
stantiated by a rigid inductive philosophy, resting entirely on
mere assumptions of the occult nature of electricity.
    2. I have in vain sought for experiments which could at all
lead us to infer the possibility of effecting a change in the
condition of the electric agency (whatever it may happen to be),
without at the same time varying the quantity of the agency
in operation. We have no means, for example, except by means
of induction, of changing the angular divergence of an electro
meter attached to an insulated charged surface whilst the quan
 tity, remains the same—that is to say, whilst the quantity affecting
 the electrometer is invariable ; in other words, we have no means
 of altering the state, condition, or quality of the electrical force
 absolutely in operation. On the other hand, we have the means
 of varying the quantity and yet of preserving the angular diver
 gence of the electrometer constant.
    Let, for example, A,C, S, <U+FB01>gs. l,2,3,Pl.VII. be three insulated
 conducting bodies of different forms and magnitude; let A be a
 circular plate of small thickness, C a cylinder, and S a sphere,
 and suppose each furnished with a delicate electrometer of diver
 gence, a, c, s (the three electrometers being precisely alike) ;
 further, suppose these three conductors to be charged with
 electricity to such an extent as will bring each of the electro
 meters to the same angle: in this case, as is well known, the
 quantity of electricity upon each of these bodies will be very
 different, notwithstanding the sameness of the electrometer indi
 cation. Here the electrical intensity of each of the bodies is said
 to be the same, and the electrical charge to have the same density
 in each. Again, take two insulated conducting spheres M, N,
 <U+FB01>gs. 4 and 5, of unequal diameters, and suppose the surface of
 the one to be three times that of the other, having delicate elec

trometers m, n attached to them as in the last case: then, if we
charge each of the globes with the same quantity, the electro
meter on the small sphere M will have a much greater angular
divergence than the electrometer on the large sphere N; from
which it has been inferred that the electricity on the small sphere
is more intense than the electricity on the large sphere, or, in
other words, that we have varied the;intensity without changing
the quantity.
   3. A further investigation of these phenomena, however, leads
to a more de<U+FB01>nite and simple explanation of them. When we
place different quantities of electricity on the three bodies A, C, S,
<U+FB01>gs. 1, 2, 3, without affecting the angular divergence of the elec
trometer, it is the total quantity which varies, and not the quan
tity in any given point of the surface (that is to say, the absolute
quantity affecting the electrometer) : the quantity a<U+FB02>ecting the
electrometer is really the same in each case, although the total
quantity upon each of the three bodies may greatly differ. It is
 in fact quite evident that, since the three bodies vary in extent of
 surface, the greater the extent of surface the greater the number of
points it will contain, and consequently the greater will be the
amount of electricity requisite to supply them: hence the quan
tity in any one point of either of the bodies, granting it not to
be in the simple ratio of the surfaces, may still be the same,
‘notwithstanding the quantity in each of the bodies is different.
   4. Now the total quantity or charge must be taken to act
upon an electrometer projecting from its surface as it would do
supposing the electricity were equally distributed; this is evident
from the fact that, in whatever point of the surface the electro
meter be placed, its angular divergence remains the same. Inten
sity in this case, therefore, when rigidly interpreted, is nothing
more nor less than the quantity of electricity at a given point of
a charged surface acting on the electrometer, and cannot possibly
be taken to express any difference in the actual state or condition
of the electrical agency.
    5. Let us now take the case of a different angular divergence
of the electroscopcs, the quantity of electricity being the same.
Take, for example, the case of the two unequal spheres M, N,
<U+FB01>gs. 4 and 5, just advcrted to, each furnished with a delicate elec
troscope m, n, and let the same quantity be transferred to each
sphere ; the electroscope 'm of the sphere M will in this case, as
already observed, have a much greater angular divergence than
the electroscope n of the sphere N. Here we perceive that the
quantity in any one point of the two spheres is not the same,
because the quantity being the same in each sphere, and the
u rface over which it is expanded in the one sphere being of
much less extent than the surface over which it is expanded

               of the Electrical Terms Intensity and Tension.     507
in the other, there would be a greater number of points in the
large sphere for the reception of the charge.
    Let the surfaces, for example, be as 3 to 1 ; then where there
is one particle on a point of the large sphere, there will be three
on a point of the smaller sphere. Here, again, intensity, when
correctly interpreted, is nothing more nor less than the quantity
of electrical force at a given point. It by no means follows,
however, that in this case the agency in operation has a higher
amount of elastic power in the one case than in the other, or is
necessarily more or less dense: if it exhibits a greater degree of
energy in any given point of the one body than it exhibits in
any given point of the other, it may be because there is a greater
amount of mere force, in operation in that point. We really can
not say, until we have a clear conception of the nature of elec
trical force, whether it is susceptible of change in quality or con
 stitution or not; and any inference, therefore, of a change in elec
trical density or tension must be mere assumption. The idea of
 a difference of density in the two cases of the small sphere and
 the large one (<U+FB01>gs. 4 8: 5), supposing the electrical agency to
 be material and subject to the laws of ordinary matter, is cer
 tainly in accordance with the deduction that, “ where there is one
 particle of force acting in a given point of the large sphere, there
 are three particles in a given point of the small sphere.” So far
 this corresponds with the theory of density, or, as better ex
 pressed perhaps by the French philosophers, with “thickness of
 stratum ;” but, as already observed, since we have no know
 ledge whatever of the occult nature of the electrical agency,
 we can scarcely venture to rely upon any hypothesis of this
 kind, but must be content to consider electricity as mere
 force, without assigning to it any speci<U+FB01>c elementary condition—
  much in the same way as we accept gravity as a mere force, with
  out troubling ourselves as to its occult nature.
     6. It follows from this that there is no such element as inten
  sity independent of quantity, and that what we are to under
  stand by intensity is only the greater or less quantity of force
  in a given point operating on the electrometer.~ We accord
  illgly <U+FB01>nd that what is called intensity, as indicated by the elec
  trometer, is subject to all the laws of quantity. It is in this
  sense I propose the term intensity to be accepted—-an accepta
  tion which frees it from all mysterious and hypothetical uncer
  tainty whatever.
     7. In considering the term intensity as applied to a charged
  electrical jar, similar considerations present themselves. The
  electrical jar is simply an electrical condenser upon Volta’s prin
  Ciple. We have here an insulated conductor (that is, the inner
  coating) in close approximation to a similar conductor (the outer
                                 2L2

508       Sir W. Snow Harris on the Correct Interpretation
 coating) in connexion with the earth.       Now we know, by very
familiar experiments, that, if a neutral conducting surface H,
<U+FB01>g. 6, in connexion with the earth be caused to approach a
 charged surface—as, for example, the plane R,-—-an electroscope
 r divergent to a given angle begins to subside, in consequence of
 the total force not operating in the direction of the electrometer
 r exclusively, but also in the direction of the approximated sur
face H ; there will not in this case be the same quantity free to
 act in the direction of the electroscope as there was before.
 We should require therefore under this new condition an increased
 quantity to be deposited upon the surface R before the electro
 scope could again diverge to the same angle. We have evidently
 in this experiment effected no speci<U+FB01>c change in the electrical
 agency; we have merely caused the same or a less quantity to
 operate on the electrometer in a given point of the surface R.
    8. Now this is precisely the condition of the electrical jar,
<U+FB01>g. 7. If we suppose the outer coating N not present, and the
jar insulated, a small quantity accumulated on the inner coating
causes a considerable divergence of the electrometer E attached
to the extremity of its charging-rod. Directly, however, we
assume the presence of the uninsulated external coating N n, the
in<U+FB02>uence of this upon the inner coating through the glass so
diverts the force acting in the direction of the electrometer E as
to cause its angular divergence to subside. We have here only
to consider, as is evident, mere force, and the direction or direc
tions in which it acts, and not an occult material agency pos
sessing variable hypothetical qualities of which we have no clear
or intelligible evidence, and the assumption of which only serves
to confuse and embarrass a simple idea.
    9. Let us now suppose attached to the charging-rod of the
jar a Lane’s discharger L, the negative ball of which, directly
opposed to the positive ball of discharge m, is in connexion with
the outer coating Nn, through an external circuit 0 m I N ; then,
as we continue to add electricity to the inner coating, the force
in the direction of the discharging electrometer L begins to
increase, and continues to do so until discharge ensues between the
inner and outer coatings through the external circuit 0 m l N. We
may here consider the total force in operation to be exerted be
tween the coatings in two directions ; that is to say, immediately
through the intervening glass of the jar on the one hand, and
through the external circuit 0 m I N on the other.
   As the amount of force through the Lane’s discharger increases,
the force between the inner and outer coatings through the glass
decreases, inasmuch as the operation of the accumulation upon the
outer coating through an external circuit in the direction of the
discharging electrometer is such as to subvert the negative state

           ‘of the Electrical Terms Intensity and Tension.       509
of the external coating, and lessen its in<U+FB02>uence upon the inner
coating through the glass ; eventually, therefore, as the accumu
lation increases, the force between the coatings through the
glass is entirely superseded by the force between the coatings
through the external circuit. We see nothing in these simple
operations which would lead us to conclude that the increasing
divergence of the electroscope E is indicative of increasing elas
ticity, tension, or other change of quality in the unknown agency.
    10. If, in accumulating a given quantity over three or more
equal electrical jars instead of one (as quoted by Riess), we <U+FB01>nd
the divergence of the electroscope greatly reduced, that is evi
dently because there is less accumulation in any one point of the
charged surfaces, as we have already explained (5), and the elec
troscope is consequently not affected to the same extent as it
would be if the accumulation were con<U+FB01>ned to one of the jars
onl .
    3% really cannot infer from these phenomena any change in
the quality of the electrical agency. It is true that the force of
the discharge will be something less when the accumulation is
on three jars instead of one jar; but that may be shown to arise
from the increased resistance to discharge, in consequence of the
greater number of charging rods and wires the accumulation has
to traverse, and other circumstances attendant on the detached
surfaces. If the accumulation be con<U+FB01>ned to a large jar and a
small jar taken separately (in which the charging rod is the
same), the force of the accumulation would be pretty much
alike in each: for example, <U+FB01>fty measures accumulated on a jar
exposing 6 square feet of coating, produces nearly the same
heating effect upon a <U+FB01>ne wire as <U+FB01>fty measures accumulated
and discharged from a jar of 3 feet or only half its surface,
although the relative electrometer intensities are nearly as 4: 1
 (supposing the thickness of the glass to be the same) ; the elec
trometer indication is four times as great on the small jar.
    The force of the discharge, therefore, in this case bears no sort
of proportion whatever to the relative intensities, considered as
indicating any difference in the constitution of the accumulated
electricity. The force of the discharge is certainly something less
from the large jar, the amount of contact between the coatings
and the glass being much greater in the case of the large jar.
The accumulated electricity does not in fact escape so freely from
the charged side of the large jar as it does from the charged side
of the smaller jar ; and hence a somewhat greater resistance to
discharge. A moment’s re<U+FB02>ection on the nature and construc
tion of the electrical jar, and the relation subsisting between its
coatings, will be sufficient to further elucidate this important
 fact. It is clear that the positive and negative coatings are

510       Sir W. Snow Harris on the Correct Intmpretation
-more or less attractive of each other through the intermediate
glass. Hence the greater the extent of coating upon which a
given quantity of electricty is accumulated, the greater will be
the number of points of positive and negative force in absolute
contact with the intervening glass, and consequently the greater
the hold which the coatings may be supposed to have upon each
other; hence the greater will be the resistance to discharge
through an external circuit. On the other hand, supposing a
given quantity to be accumulated on a comparatively small ex
tent of coated surface, then the fewer will be the number of
points of positive and negative force in immediate contact with
the intervening glass, and hence the coatings have a less hold
upon each other than inzthe former case ; discharge in_the direc
tion of an external circuit will therefore be more free and more
readily effected. Now we know, from well-established experi
 ments, that the heat elicited in metallic wires by a given quantity
 of electricitywill be less as the resistance to discharge is greater; a
given quantity therefore discharged from a small extent of sur
face may possibly have in some instances a somewhat greater
 effect on a metallic wire than the same quantity discharged from
 a large extent of surface, since the accumulated electricity dis
 engages itself more freely from a small surface than from a large
 one; the difference, however, is in no case considerable, and has
 no relation whatever to what has been termed electrical intensity.
    11. Again, as already observed (1), in the construction of voltaic
 batteries, a few large plates principally relate to quantity ; whilst
 in breaking up those plates into a long alternating series of
 smaller plates, we are supposed thereby to impart to the elec
 trical agency intensity or tension. Here again we may perceive
 that the apparently increased energy of the voltaic force in the
 latter case is solely due to the increased quantity in a given point
 of the terminating plates. Imagine, for example, four series of
 voltaic plates of 1 foot square to be divided and arranged in a
 voltaic series of thirty-six consecutive plates of only 4 inches
 square. In this case the terminating plates of the small series
 have only the one-ninth part of the surface of the terminating
 plates of the large series; there would consequently (supposing
  the quantity developed by the voltaic action to be the same in
  each case) be nine times the quantity in a given point of the
  terminating plates of the small series that there would be in a
  given point of the terminating plates of the large series.
     Intensity therefore still agrees with quantity acting at a given
  point, and by no means implies elastic power, tension, or any
  other of those hypothetical occult qualities above alluded to.
  The heating power of the current-discharge, however, from the
  large plates, unlike that of the large and small jars above quoted,

              of the Electrical Terms Intensity and Tension.       511
is greater than from the series of small ones, inasmuch as there
is less obstruction in the way of discharge from a series of four
large plates than from a prolonged series of thirty-six small
plates, whilst, on the other hand, there will be a greater quantity
on the terminating small plates of the long series, and conse
quently a more intense action in those plates. Hence it has
been said that heating effect depends on quantity, and chemical
action on intensity.
     12. The term “tension” is more especially applicable to the
polarized condition of accumulated electric particles, or to the state
of the particles of any dielectric medium intermediate between a
positive and negative surface, as, for example, to the particles of
the glass of an electrical jar interposed between its inner and
outer coatings, or to the particles of the atmosphere or other
dielectric medium intermediate between a positive and negative
surface. These particles, as Faraday has shown, assume a pecu
liar polarized state, which state, when the electrical accumula
tion upon the opposed conducting surfaces exceeds a given
 amount, they can with dif<U+FB01>culty maintain, in which case the
 electrical strain upon them becomes so great that they return
 with violence to their normal condition, so that discharge ensues
 through the intermediate dielectric medium. This electrical
 strain or condition to which the particles are thus subject may
 hence be fairly characterized by the term tension ; and therefore
 this term may be de<U+FB01>ned to be the constrained state of the par
 ticles of any electrical accumulation, or of any dielectric medium
 interposed between two oppositely charged surfaces; whilst the
 term intensity applies to the quantity of electricity at a given
 point of a charged surface acting upon the electrometer.
     In accordance with these views of tension and intensity, we
 <U+FB01>nd that whilst intensity (that is to say, the electrometer indi
 cation        is as the square of the quantity, electrical tension, or
 disruptive force, as measured by a Lane’s striking electrometer,
 is simply as the quantity.
     13. The distribution of force alluded to (9) in the charge and
 discharge of the electrical jar, admits of geometrical representation
 in a way calculated to elucidate in a satisfactory manner the
 precise condition of this ques
 tion.                               A       8       -7'      9       B

 equal and successive quantities of electricity communicated to
 the electrical jar; and the total rectangular space A B C D
 may stand for, and represent the total charge.             Now, since
 the force between the coatings continually decreases (9) as the
 force through the external circuit increases, therefore these forces
 may be represented by any magnitude supposed to flow, and at
 the same time continually increase or decrease. Let therefore
 the line A C move forward parallel to itself as before, and con
 tinually decrease by the linear magnitudes c It, fi, g in, BD) which
 are proportional to the lines Ae, Af, A _q, A.B, that is to the
 respective quantities of electricity C c, Cj, C y, C B), and so gene
 rate the triangular space A D C, which may stand for and repre
 sent the total force in the direction of the coatings up to the
 point D, where it vanishes in explosive discharge. Similarly let
 the extremity A of the line C A <U+FB02>ow and gradually increase by
 the same proportional lines c 1;, f2', g k, B D, generating the tri
 angular space A B D, which may stand for and represent the total
 force in the direction of the circuit up to the same point of ex
 plosion D. This being understood, we may observe that the <U+FB01>rst
 quantity accumulated being represented by the space Ce, the force
 in the direction of the coatings will be represented by the rectili
 near space C h, and the force in the direction of the external circuit
 (that is, the electrometer indication) by the triangular space A e /1.
 Similarly a double quantity of charge will be represented by the
double space Cf= twice C e ; the force in the direction of the coat
ings by the rectilinear space C i ; and the force in the direction of
the external circuit by the triangular space Afi, and so on. But
 the triangles A e h, A fi are to each other as the square of A e
to the square of Af; and since Af is double of A e, these trian
 gular spaces are as 4 : 1. In the same way it may be shown
that the triangles A 9 k, Aeh are as 9 : 1, and so on. Now, as
these triangles stand for and represent the force through the
external circuit, that is to say, the respective electrometer in
dications, whilst the sides Ae, Af, A g, &c. are proportional
to the respective accumulations Ce, C j, &c., we see that the
force in the direction of the circuit is (all other things remaining
the same) directly proportional to the square of the quantity
accumulating. It is easy to see by the diagram that the
decrements of force upon each added quantity will be as the
rectilinear spaces C it, mi, n k, 0 lcD, whilst the increasing force
in the direction of the circuit will be represented by the trian
gular spaces A e h, Afi, Ag It, A B D.
   14. In like manner let thelincs A e, AJ‘, A g, &c. stand for the
intervals, or explosive distances between the balls of the Lane’s
discharger, L, <U+FB01>g. 7, which the force in the direction of the
external circuit can break through, the increasing force being

             _ of the Eleclrical Terms Iniensityand Terision.            513
represented by the triangles Aeh, Ai, &c.: then, since"the
attractive forces between the exploding points of the balls of the
discharger, with a given accumulation, are in the inverse duplicate
ratio of the distances A e, Af, A g, 850., these attractive forces will
be inversely proportional to the same triangularspaccs A e /1, Af2',
A g k, &c.        If, therefore, when force in the direction of the cir
cuit is A e /z, discharge takes place,‘ quantity being C e, distance
Ae, and attractive force between discharging balls = 1, then
supposing A e to become Af = twice A e, the force between the
balls at distance A f would be only one-fourth as great ; that is
to say, it would be inversely as triangle A e /1 to triangle Af1'.
Hence with the same quantity accumulated = C e discharge
could not occur at distance Af. Let now the <U+FB01>rst quantity
accumulated = C e become twice as great; that is to say, let
it be represented by rectangular space Cf=2 C e: in this case
the force in the direction of the external circuit would be
represented by triangle Af2' =4.- times A e /1 ; and since attrac
tive force between the exploding points of the balls of the dis
charger is as squares of the quantity accumulated, therefore attrac
tive force through the external circuit with the double accumu
lation Cf becomes also four times as great; and is the same at
distance Afwith a double accumulation as at distance A c with a
single accumulation; in this case explosive discharge again ensues.
    In a similar way it may be shown that when distance Ac
is extended to Ag, attractive force between the balls with the
single accumulation C e is reduced to one-ninth, in which case
no explosive discharge could occur at distance Ag. Let the
quantity accumulated, however, become three times as great,
that is to say, let rectanglar space C e become Cg; in this case
the force through the external circuit is represented by the tri
angular space Ag k=9 times triangular space A eh; but since
these spaces are inversely proportional to the attractive forces at
distances Ae, Ag, attractive force at distance Ag is the same
with a treble accumulation, as at distance Aewith a single accu
mulation ; explosive discharge will therefore again occur, and so
on. Hence the interval at which discharge occurs, as measured
by a Lane’s discharger L, <U+FB01>g. 7, will be directly as the quantity
accumulated ; whilst the electrometer indication or force through
the external circuit will be as the square of the quantity, being
as the triangular spaces A eh, Afi, Ag k, &c. M. De la Rive,
in his comprehensive treatise on Electricity, considers this result
as somewhat remarkable*.             It is evident, however, from the
   " Ce qu’il y a d’assez remarquable, c’est que la distance a laquelle une
décharge entre deux balles chargées d’électricités contraires pent avoir lieu,
est simplement proportionnelle aux quantités d’électricité, tandis que les
forces attractives sont proportionnelles aux can-és de ces forces.”-—Traite

5141         On the Electrical Terms Intensity and Tension.
geometrical diagram above referred to, that it could not be other
wise, and is a necessary result of the forces in operation. We may
infer from the equality of the triangles AD C, AD B, that at
the instant of explosive discharge the force A B D through the
external circuit has superseded the force A D C in the direction
of the coatings. If, therefore, we suppose discharge to occur
with the successive accumulated quantities C e, Cf, C y, &c.,
then discharge with <U+FB01>rst quantity =C e at distance Ae, force
through external circuit will be represented by triangle Ame,
and force in the direction of coatings by triangle A m C. VVhen
discharge occurs at distance Af=2A c with a double accumula
tion Cf=2C e, force through the circuit will be represented by
triangle Anf, and force in the direction of the coatings by tri
angle A 1| C, and so on. We have here to observe, however, that,
in estimating the forces through the circuit, the force for quan
tity C e, and distance of discharging balls A ]'= 2A e, will be no
longer represented by triangle A m e (when quantity becomes
C_f=2C e), but by triangle A r e, or one-fourth of triangle A 11
= force through the circuit at the instant of discharge with a
double quantity.       When, therefore, distance A e is increased
to Af with the unit of charge represented by Ce, then force
acting through the external circuit is represented by triangle
Are, and not by triangle A m e.
   In order therefore to measure a double accumulation by means
of a moveable electrometer, we must oppose to the force through
the circuit four times the resistance: thus, in the operation of
Cuthbertson’s ingenious steel-yard discharging electrometer, we
must, in order to obtain a double accumulation, set the slider of
the balance-arm to four times the number of grains; in order to
obtain a treble accumulation, we must set the slider of the balance
arm to nine times the number of grains, and so on.         VVhen, in
the application of Lane’s discharger,,therefore, discharge occurs
at a double distance, the quantity of electricity accumulated is
twice as great, and the respective forces through the circuit as
1 : 4.-, as represented by the triangles A e r, Afn; when discharge
occurs at a treble distance, the quantity of electricity accumulated
is three times as great, and the force through the circuit nine
times as great, as represented by the triangles A e s, A _q 0, and so
on,—--the force through the circuit being, as already observed, as
the square of the quantity.
   15. It may perhaps be as well to further remark that, although,
according to the diagram, the forces ABD, AD C are at the
instant of discharge considered as equal, we cannot however infer
their precise equality, or suppose the decreasing force AD C in
the direction of the circuit to absolutely vanish at the point D :
hence some little residuum, commonly called residual discharge,

may remain in the jar in consequence of the vanishing attractive
force which the coatings exert upon each other, as is found by
experiment.

.LXXIII. On Chemical Notation. By J. J. Warnusron, Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
 IN your last Number, Mr. Odling has remarked on my com
       munication advocating the vapour-density system of chemi
cal notation. I have been in the habit of using it in arranging
the thermo-molecular facts of chemistry in a convenient form for
 easy reference; and <U+FB01>nding that it enabled the mind to grasp
easily rather complicated molecular relations which could not
 be done with any other without tedious verbal accompaniment,
 I endeavoured some ten or <U+FB01>fteen years ago to bring it to the
 notice either of the Royal Society or British Association ; I forget
 which. The attempt was unavailing, as indeed it is likely to be
 in the present case, if some professional chemist of eminence
 does not take it up in a magnanimous spirit. I did not trouble
 myself further on the subject, because I felt that, as chemical
 science progressed, it would be certain to be adopted in regular
 course as the natural symbolic language—indeed that it would be
 impossible to get on without it—and that it would be better
 that the suggestion should come from within the schools. But
 years have passed on, and the chance of this seemed becoming
 less by degrees, until I was incited to make another effort by
 Mr. Odling’s lecture, in which it appeared as if the school of
 chemists to which he belongs had permanently adopted an im
 proper system, and were actually making mistakes in con
 sequence.
      The vapour-density system (or, for shortness, let us call it
  the V.D. system) is founded on the bulk of all molecules in
  the gaseous state being equal. This, according to Mr. Odling,
  is an extremely recognized fact among chemists*. “Let chemi
   _ * At p. 513 of Dr. Graham’s second volume the following occurs :—
  “ 3. The system (of notation):of Gerhardt, based, like that of Berzelius, on
  the hypothesis that all simple gases contain equal number of atomsin equal
  volumes.”       See also p. 512, vol. ii. This, I presume, is concurred in by
  Mr. Odling and the school ; so that we are to understand that they are agreed
  that ( l) it is a fact that all simple or compound gases and vapours contain
  equal number of molecules in equal volumes; and (2) that the system of
  notation they adopt is based on the hypothesis that the simple gases contain
  equal number of atoms in equal volumes.

  516        . Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation.
  cal notation be founded thereupon [upon the fact (1) only, not
  upon the hypothesis (2) (see note), or upon any hypothesis], and
  we obtain with perfect concisencss at once the chemical com
  position, the physical density of a unit volume, and the con
  stitution of a molecule.”    On this Mr. Odling remarks, “he
  certainly never before heard that the vapour-density of any given
 body pointed to some particular number as the expression of
  its molecular weiglzt.” This is an extraordinary admission.
 Is it possible that the <U+FB01>rst and most obvious consequence
 of the equality in bulk of gaseous molecules is a sealed book
 to Mr. Odling’s school? How powerful then must be the in
 <U+FB01>uence of preconceived notions when they shut out from intel
 lectual vision the almost self-evident fact that vapour-densi
 ties must be proportional to molecular weights if molecules are
 of equal bulk, and therefore that they (the vapour-densities)
 point directly to, or in fact actually express, the molecular
 weights. If it is not self-evident, here is the proof :—
     Let w= weight of a molecule of the gas A, and W= weight
 of a molecule of the gas B. If there are n molecules of the gas
 A in the space of a cubic foot, there are n molecules of the gas B
 in the space of a cubic foot. The weight of a cubic foot of gas
 A is therefore nw, and the weight of a cubit foot of gas B is nW.
 The vapour-density of gas A is to vapour-density of gas B as
 nw:nW::w:W. Q.E.D.
     Molecular weights are ratios, vapour-densities are ratios ; and
 these ratios are identical if all molecules in the gaseous state
 have the same bulk.
     Mr. Odling may say that by vapour-density he means the
 speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the vapours expressed in terms of water or
 air as unity, and that these numbers do not point to “ some par
ticular numbers as the molecular weights : ” but they certainly
do, inasmuch as molecular weights are ratios which are indicated
 or “pointed to” by the ratio of the numbers that express the
vapour-densities. That the density of the gas of least speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity should be selected in preference to any other as the
 standard unit of comparison is clear from this, that it is easier
for the mind to compare magnitudes together when they are
expressed in terms of the least; because if they were expressed
in any other, we should have to compare multiples with recipro
cals, reciprocals with reciprocals, and multiples with multiples;
whereas expressed in terms of the least, we have to compare
multiples with multiples only—one mental process in place
of three.
    The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of gases and vapours in terms of hydrogen
unity are identical as numbers with the molecular weights ex
pressed in terms of hydrogen unity. This Mr. Odling’s school

             Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation.          517
must admit is as indisputable as that of the equality in the volume
of gaseous molecules, which Mr. Odling informs us is as clearly
recognized as the most simple truths of the multiplication table.
May we not therefore ask, Why, in the name of Cooker and com
mon sense, are these numbers not given to the chemical symbolic
letters? which would thus be made to express vapour-density as
Well as molecular weight, and in compound or composite mole
cules would carry the same meaning; while if bodies entered
into combination by fractions of molecules they would appear in
the formulm as such, and require no verbal discussion.
   If the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of oxygen is 16 times that of hydrogen,
and if the molecular weight of oxygen is 16 times that of
hydrogen, is not 16 associated with O and l. with H irrevo
cably? and does it not disturb this association, and therefore
fatally distract the attention, to give any other numerical values
to these symbols? I use the word fatally, because I believe that
serious errors as well as general confusion have arisen from this
apparently insigni<U+FB01>cant cause. A few of these were noticed in
my previous communication. It is specially when chemistry is
studied in its thermo-molecular relations that they assume a pro
minent aspect.
   Mr. Odling states that “the object of his lecture was to show
on chemical grounds that the chemical molecule of water is iden
tical with its physical molecule, and consequently that this mole
cule contains double the amount of hydrogen contained in the
molecule of muriatic acid.” If the lecture was delivered to
teach that the hydrogen of the water-molecule was double the
hydrogen of the muriatic acid molecule, there would have been
no occasion for it if the vapour-density system of chemical nota
tion had been in vogue, because such facts of molecular compo
sition are expressed by it so completely that any verbal addition
whatever becomes super<U+FB02>uous, e. g. water is HO%=9, which
means that a gaseous molecule of water 1S composed of a gaseous
molecule of hydrogen (1), united with half a gaseous molecule
of oxygen (8). Muriatic acid is I-1"?‘ Cl“l“=18;‘;, which means
that a gaseous molecule of muriatic acid gas is composed of
half a molecule of hydrogen united with half a molecule of
chlorine.
   The verbal explanation here appended to these formulae would
not of course he required if the V.D. system were fully recog
nized. The di<U+FB02><U+FB01>culty of making known anything that requires
a little quiet application and study to master is well illustrated
by the formula for nitric acid given by Mr. Odling as expressed
on the V.D. system (Phil. Mag. p. 381), H'*N‘3‘ 01%. Now dry
nitric acid is NO2'1‘=54.', which means that a molecule of its

518         Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation.
vapour is composed of a molecule of nitrogen gas united with 2%
molecules of oxygen gas; the monohydrate by HOi . NO2‘}=63
if the water-molecule continues united with the acid molecule
                                    t      '31}
when in the vapour form, or -I§O—é—1\i()—=3l§      if they separate ;
                              1      2‘
the quadrihydrate by                    =20'4 if they separate, and
so on.
   The method of determining these forinulw methodically by
simple equation in the most involved cases is given in the pre
vious communication. We ought to be able to read the name
of a compound in its V.D. formula; and reversely we may cor
rect the name by means of the same when it has been impro
perly bestowed.
   But without the V.D. system, the ratio of hydrogen in the
water- and muriatic acid molecules might be easily proved as
follows :—
  In muriatic acid, one part byweight of hydrogen unites with 35'5
parts by weight of chlorine, and its vapour-density is 1825 times
that of hydrogen. One cubic foot of muriatic acid gas contains as
many molecules as one cubic foot of hydrogen gas (according to
Mr. Odlings ridiculously clear two and two fact) ; therefore the
weight of each molecule of muriatic acid gas is l8'25 times that of
each molecule of hydrogen gas ; but the proportion of the weight of
a molecule of the acid gas that is hydrogen is only       part ; and
since the molecule of the acid gas weighs 18'25 times the weight
of the molecule of hydrogen,          part of 1825 is 0'5, which is
the weight of hydrogen in a molecule of the acid gas in terms
of the hydrogen molecule unity. In the composition of water,
1 part by weight of hydrogen unites with 8 parts by weight of
oxygen, and the vapour-density of steam is nine times hydrogen ;
the weight of its molecule is nine times the hydrogen molecule,
and one-ninth part of the weight of the steam-molecule being
hydrogen, the weight of hydrogen in a steam-molecule is 1 ex
pressed in terms of the hydrogen molecule unity. Thus the
weight of hydrogen in a molecule of muriatic acid gas is to the
weight of hydrogen in a molecule of water as 0'5 : 1, or as 1 :2.
Q.E.D.
   Since this obvious deduction from the recognized fact of the
equality of gaseous molecules has escaped notice (for if it had not
escaped notice, how could a lecture to prove so simple a matter
have been thought necessary), it is not incorrect to say that the
arithmetical part of chemistry is not in a satisfactory condition,

             Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation.          519
and that any attempt to put it in a more satisfactory -condition
deserves the support of chemists.
    When previously remarking on Mr. Odling’s statement with
reference to sodium, I <U+FB01>nd that I have understood what he calls
hydrate of sodium to be hydrate of soda, and applied the same
formulae to it as to the hydrate of potash. Thus Na in contact
with HO‘}, HOi expels the H of one HO%, and unites with the
other HO* to form the solid hydrate of soda, HO‘l- NaOi. When
this is heated with sodium, the H of the HO‘§ is ejected and gives
place to a second Na; so that HO"‘ . NaO‘§ becomes
                       Nao%.Nao#=-.2Nao%.
    Of hydrate of sodium (if it is not a mistake) I know nothing,
nor can I <U+FB01>nd mention made of it in any work on chemistry that
I have access to. If Mr. Odling would have the kindness to
express what he means in the V.D. notation, it would then per
 haps be possible to understand him.
    With reference to the statement in my previous communica
 tion, “ that HK9 represents one molecule of the hydrate of pot
 ash, but HI-I9 not one but two molecules of water, and KK9
not one but two molecules of anhydrous potash,” Mr. Odling
informs us in a note that Mr. Watts- (author of the Supplement
of Dr. Gregory’s ‘ Chemistry ’) states to him “that the three for-'
 mulae were meant to express a single molecule each, the three
 quantities represented being exactly comparable.” I repeat that
 this is impossible, and strikingly shows the inefficiency of Ger
 hardt’s system when it can so notoriously mislead eminent
 chemists. The following is the proof :-Let us assume that
 they do express a single molecule each ; then, since HH9 repre
 sents a single molecule of water, the value of the symbol H in
 terms of the weight of a hydrogen gas-molecule considered as
 unity must be % ; and the value of 9 must be 8, because the
  single molecule of water weighs nine times the single molecule
  of hydrogen, and is                =9.    Potassium, K, thrown
  into water displaces half the hydrogen and forms hydrate of pot
  ash , HK9, orH+K+9l
                  %_|_39_|_8f-

                                -47-s-,so th a,1             bl H
  and 9 retain the same value in the single molecule HH9 as in
  the single molecule HK9, the hydrate of potassa, HK9, must
  consist of half a gaseous molecule of hydrogen    , half a gaseous
  molecule of oxygen (8) and potassium (39). But 39 of potassium
  in union with 8 of oxygen is potassa, so that all that is left to
  represent the water of the hydrate is H= g, whereas the water
  molecule is HH9.

  520           Mr. J. J. Waterston on Chemical Notation.
      Reverting to the single molecule HKQ, or                 =47'5.'
  When it is heated with potassium, “the remaining half of the
  hydrogen is displaced and anhydrous potash, KK9, is formed,”
  which KK9 Mr. Watts holds is a single molecule. The remaining
  half of the hydrogen_is H = %, andK=39'substituted for it gives:
  H+ K +9                           .           K + K +9
   5 + 39 _,_ 8 } =47'5 converted into KK9, or 39 + 39 + 8        = 86,
  which is stated by Mr. Watts to be a single molecule of anhy
  drous potash, which is thus represented as being composed of
  78 potassa in union with 8 of oxygen, instead of 39.
     On the other hand, if HH9 represents 2 molecules of water,
  H = 1, and 9: 16, the line through the 0 representing 9= 2 x 8,
 showing that Gerhardt understood his symbol 9 to represent a
 dual nature, but unfortunately avoided fractional exponents.
 Let 0% represent one of those components of 9, and O* the
 other; then HH9=HOlI. HO‘5 = two molecules of water; and
 K brought in contact displaces one H, forming one molecule of
 the hydrate KO§.H‘O%; and this, heated with potassium, ex?
 changes the remaining H for another K, forming
                          Kot, K0%=2 110%,
 or twice the molecule of the potassa contained in the hydrate.
     Can anything be clearer than this? Will no chemist enter the
 list and advocate the V.D. system, which after all is but Ger
hardt’s system slightly modi<U+FB01>ed, so that there should be nothing
but arithmetical symbols required. But the advantages attend
ing the alteration are great, as will be acknowledged in due time
if it ever be adopted.

   the same time I connect the poles M and N with a' sine-com

   (This is a sine-compass of variable sensibility which I have

    ' I accordingly obtain W, that is the heat disengaged by the
   current of the element E from the solution of an equivalent of

 is very nearly equal to the heat produced by chemical action.
    Daniell’s element is the only one in which it is so. _ In other,
  elements, the heat produced by the current in the entire circuit
 and the heat produced by chemical‘ action are often remarkably
 different. The following are some of the results obtained :

      LXXV. On the Velocity of Light and the Sun’s Distance.
          By Prof. Josnrn Lovnnino, of Harvard Colle_qe*.
  FOUCAULTS recent experiment on the velocity of light,
         though of a less popular character than his celebrated
  pendulum experiment to prove the earth’s rotation, will never
 theless attract even more attention among men of science. If its
 results are placed beyond doubt, they will affect astronomy to a
 degree not possible for the pendulum experiment, unless it had
 come as early as the time of Galileo. I shall examine Foucault’s
 investigation on the velocity of light, (1) as it in<U+FB02>uences the
 science of optics, and (2) as it tells upon one at least of the
 vexed questions in astronomy.
    In the circle of the sciences, the centre may be placed any
 where, and the circumference will be everywhere; such is the
 mutual dependence of each upon all the rest. After the science
 of optics has furnished astronomy with the telescope, the astro
 nomer discovers with it the satellites of Jupiter and the aberra
 tion of light, and with the help of these phenomena assigns the
 value of the velocity of light, and thus repays to optics the
 debt incurred by his own special science. Now, for the <U+FB01>rst
 time, the science of optics has relinquished the guardianship
 of astronomy, ascertained by direct experiment one of its own
 fundamental data, and thereby possibly put astronomy under
 a new obligation, to be cancelled, doubtless, with interest here
after.
    Let us glance <U+FB01>rst at the two astronomical methods of mea
suring the velocity of light. While the senses of touch and taste
act only by contact, those of hearing and seeing bring the mind
into communication with distant objects. The air and the omni
present nether supply the delicate and ever ramifying threads by
which telegraphic intercourse is maintained with the ear and the
eye. When the origin of the sound or the light is at a large
distance compared with the velocity of the acoustic or luminous
        * From Silliman’s American Journal for September 1863.

                       and the Sun’s Distance.                 ' 0255
Wave, allowance must be made for the time taken by the news
of an audible or visible event to come to us. Only the vast
spaces of astronomy are commensurable with the great velocity
of light, and furnish a su<U+FB02>iciently large theatre for a direct
experiment upon it. But in stellar astronomy the magni<U+FB01>cence
of the extent of view so far transceds in magnitude even the
velocity of light, that the luminous ray, vast as is its velocity,
seems to loiter upon its long way.
   Hence in astronomy a distinction exists between the actual
interval of successive events and the apparent interval. For
example, the <U+FB01>rst satellite of Jupiter revolves around its primary
in about 425- hours, and therefore enters the shadow of Jupiter,
and is eclipsed, once every 42;‘, hours. As it takes light more
than 40 minutes to pass over the average distance of Jupiter,
the eclipse is not seen until so many minutes on the average
after it has happened. If this delay were constant, the interval
of successive eclipses would not be changed. But in the
course of six months the distance of the earth from Jupiter
increases by the diameter of the earth’s orbit, and in the next
six months changes back again; and when the earth is nearest
to Jupiter, the news of an eclipse reaches us in about 32 minutes,
whereas, if the earth is at the greatest distance, 50 minutes are
required.
   Consequently the intervals between successive eclipses, as
they exist for our eyes, are variable, being sometimes larger and
sometimes smaller than the real intervals.       This irregularity in
the apparent intervals of the eclipses of the same satellite, at
<U+FB01>rst attributed to errors of observation, <U+FB01>nally conducted Romer,
in 1675, to the discovery of the velocity of light. Delambre,
after discussing 1000 of these eclipses observed between 1662
and 1802, calculated the velocity of light to be such as to
require 493'2 seconds to pass over the mean distance of the sun.
If this time divides 95,360,000 statute miles, which is the sun’s
distance as given by the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769
according to Encke’s computations, the quotient, or 193,350
 statute miles, is the velocity of light in a second.
    The second process which astronomy has supplied for obtain
ing the velocity of light may be called the indirect method. It
demands not a space but a velocity which is commensurable with
the velocity of light. If two such velocities are compounded
together, according to the principle of the parallelogram of
motions, there is a resultant motion, the direction of which devi
ates sensibly from that even of the largest motion which enters
into the composition. In nature the velocity of the earth is
compounded in this way with the velocity of light, and imparts
to the light an apparent path differing by a small angle from the

526' '          Prof. Lovering on the Velocity of Light
true path. The angular displacement which this causes between
the apparent and real places of a star is called aberration, and
was <U+FB01>rst discovered by Bradley in 1726,——this astronomer
explaining, on this simple principle, anomalies in observation
which had hitherto been considered accidental. As the dis
placement of the star works opposite ways at opposite seasons
of the year, half the difference between the extreme places is
the distance from the apparent to the true place, or the constant
of aberration,      This, when known as an observed fact, esta
blishes the ratio between the velocity of light and the velocity of
the earth, and enables the astronomer to assign the value of
 the one with all the accuracy which pertains to his knowledge
 of the other. Accepting Struve’s determination of the aberra
tion, viz. 20”'45, the velocity of light is calculated to be 10,088
times as great as the velocity of the earth. The mean velocity
 of the earth is known with all the certainty which belongs to our
 knowledge of the magnitude of the earth’s orbit, that is, of the
 sun’s distance. Assuming, as before, that the distance derived
 from Encke’s parallax is the most reliable, the velocity of the
 earth in one second of solar time is 18977 miles. This, multi
 plied by the aforesaid ratio, gives 191,513 miles for the velocity
 of light by Bradley’s principle. It appears therefore that the
 velocities by the two methods of astronomy (the direct and the.
 indirect) differ by 1837 miles——-a small quantity comparatively,
 being only one per cent. of the whole velocity. Whatever other
 value is adopted for the sun’s distance will alter these two results
 proportionally, without disturbing the ratio between them. I
 may add that the velocity which aberration ascribes to light
 belongs to it _at the earth’ surface—that is, in the dense atmo
 sphere; whereas the velocity discovered from the eclipses is that
 which extends through the planetary spaces. This distinction,
 however, will do little towards bringing the two results into
 greater accordance. The velocities of light in different media
 are proportional to the indices of refraction inversely, which
 in the case presented are as 1 to 1000294.            This theoretical
 difference of velocities is less than 3-5151; of the whole, or less
 than 70 miles.
  ; Compare with these conclusions of astronomy two experi
 mental results on the same subject. Although Wheatstone’s
 experiment on the velocity of electricity, published in 1834,
 suggested the possibility of measuring in a similar way other
 great velocities, I shall consider <U+FB01>rst a contrivance of Fizeau,
 equally applicable to light and to electricity. If a wheel <U+FB01>nely
 cut into teeth on its circumference is put in rapid rotation, a ray
 of light which escapes between two consecutive teeth will, after
 bei;1g__i-eiiected pe1_'p€ndi_cularly by a mirror, return to strike the

                      and the S'un’s Distarica.   .   '          52%
wheel at a different point, and either be intercepted by a tootlr
or admitted at another interstice. Suppose the velocity of the
wheel just su<U+FB01>icient to bring the adjacent tooth to the position
whence the ray <U+FB01>rst started, in the time which the light occupies
in going to the mirror and returning. In this time the wheel
has moved over an angle found by dividing 360° by twice the
number of teeth which the wheel contains. Therefore thetime
taken by light in going over a line equal to twice the distance
of the mirror, is that portion of a second found by dividing
unity by the product of the number of turns the wheel makes‘
in a second multiplied by double the number of teeth on the
wheel, the velocity of the wheel being <U+FB01>rst made the smallest
which will cause it to intercept the light. Such an experiment
was made in 1849 by Fizeau, the wheel being placed in a tower
at Suresne, near Paris, and the mirror upon ahill (Montmartre)
at the distance of 8633 metres. As the wheel contained 720
teeth, and the slowest velocity which produced obscuration was
12-6 turns a second, it appeared that light required Wm of a_
second ‘to go 8633 metres and return.         Hence its velocity was
 313,274,304 metres, or 194,667 miles a second.         The French
Academy thought so favourably of this attempt that they re
ferred the subject to a scienti<U+FB01>c commission, consisting of Biot,
Arago, Pouillet, and Regnault, with authority to procure a grand
 machine for repeating the experiment;
 - When Arago advocated the claims of Wheatstone to the
vacant place of Corresponding Member of the French Academy
 in the section of Physics, it was objected that Wheatstone had
 only made a single experiment without having discovered a
 principle. Arago engaged to prove that the candidate had
 introduced a fertile method of experimentation which would be
 felt in other sciences as well as electricity. For example, the
 corpuscular theory of light requires that the velocities of light
 in different media should vary directly as the indices of refrac=
 tion, whereas the undulatory theory inverts this ratio. Arago
 prepared for the trial by experiments on rapid rotation, the
 mechanical difficulties to be overcome, and the comparative
 advantage of slower rotations assisted by several re<U+FB02>exjons in
 place of a single mirror turning with its maximum speed.
 Aided by the re<U+FB01>ned skill of Breguet, he realized velocities in the
 mirror of 1000 turns a second, and of the axis detached from the
 mirror, of even 8000 turns. In the meanwhile his eyesight began
 to fail him, and younger physicists entered into the fruit of his
 labours. After Foucault and Fizeau, by separate efforts, had
 decided the question in relation to the velocities of light in'air
 andin Water, in favour of the undulatory theory, and thus con
 <U+FB01>rmed a conclusion which Arago reached by di<U+FB01>raction in 1838,

528             Prof. Lovering on the Velocity ofLight
and after Fizeau had studied the variation of the velocity of
light in running water according as the motions agree or differ
in direction, Foucault was emboldened to attempt a measure of
the absolute velocity of light by an experiment which could be
brought within the compass of a single room. I translate his
own account of the arrangements made for this purpose.
   " A pencil of solar light, re<U+FB02>ected into a horizontal direction by a
heliostat, falls upon the micrometric mark, which consists of a series
of vertical lines distant from one another one-tenth of a millimetre.
This mark, which in the experiment is the real standard of measure,
has been divided very carefully by Froment. The rays which have
traversed this initial surface fall upon a plane rotating mirror at the
distance of 0. metre, where they suffer the <U+FB01>rst re<U+FB01>exion, which sends
them to a. concave mirror at the distance of four metres. Between
these two mirrors, and as near as possible to the plane mirror, is
placed an object-glass, having in one of its conjugate fool the virtual
image of the mark, and in the other the surface of the concave mirror.
These conditions being fulfilled, the pencil of light, after traversing the
lens, forms an image of the mark on the surface of this concave mirror.
   “Thence the pencil is re<U+FB02>ected a second time, in a direction just
oblique enough to avoid the rotating mirror, an image of which it
forms in the air at a certain distance. At this place a second cou
cave mirror is placed, facing so that the pencil, once more re<U+FB02>ected,
returns to the neighbourhood of the <U+FB01>rst concave mirror, forming a.
second image of the mark. This is taken up by a third concave
mirror, and so on to the formation of a last image of the mark on
the surface of the last concave mirror of an odd number. [have
been able to use <U+FB01>ve mirrors, which furnish a line twenty metres
long for the ray to travel.
   “ The last of these minors. separated from the preceding one, which
faces it, by a distance of four metres (equal to its radius of curva
ture), returns the pencil back on itself—a condition surely ful<U+FB01>lled
when the returning image and the original image on the last mirror
but one coalesce. Then we are sure that the pencil retraces its
steps, returns in full to the plane mirror, and all the rays go back
through the mark, point for point, as they went forth.
   “ This return of the pencil may be proved on an accessible image
by re<U+FB02>ecting the pencil to one side by a surface of glass at an angle
of 45°. and examining it through a microscope of small power. The
latter, resembling in all respects the micrometric microscopes in use
for astronomical observations, forms, with the mark and the inclined
glass, one solid piece of apparatus.
   "The real image sent into the microscope, and formed by the
returning rays partially re<U+FB02>ected, occupies a de<U+FB01>nite position in rela
tion to the glass and the mark itself. This position is precisely that
of the virtual image of the mark seen by re<U+FB01>exion in the glass.          At
least this is true when the plane rotating mirror is at rest.          But
when this mirror turns, the image changes its place; for while the
light is going and returning between the mirrors, the plane mirror

                        and the Sun’s Distance.          7           529
has shifted its position, and the returning rays do not strike at the
same angle of incidence as when they left it. Hence the image is
displaced in the direction of the rotation, and this displacement in
creases with the velocity of rotation; it also increases with the
length of the route passed over by the rays, and with the distance of
the mark from the plane mirror.
    “If we call V the velocity of light, It the number of times the
mirror turns in a second, I the distance between the plane mirror
and the last concave mirror, r the distance of the mark from the
                                                                  81rnlr _
turning mirror, and d the observed displacement, we have V=         d    I
an expression which gives the velocity of light when the other quan
tities are separately measured. The distances l and 1- are measured
directly by a rule. The deviation is observed micrometrically; it
remains to show how the number of turns (12) of the mirror is found.
     “ Let us describe <U+FB01>rst how a constant velocity is imparted to the
 mirror. This mirror, of silvered glass, and 14 millims. in diameter,
 is mounted directly upon the axis of a small air-turbine, of a well
known model, admirably constructed by Froment. The air is sup
 plied by a high-pressure bellows of Cavaillé-Colle, justly distin
 guished for the manufacture of large organs. As it is important
 that the pressure should be very constant, the air after leaving the
 bellows traverses a regulator, recently contrived by Cavaillé, in which
 the pressure does not vary by one-<U+FB01>fth of a millimetre in a column
 of water of thirty centimetres. The fluid <U+FB02>owing through the ori<U+FB01>ces
 of the turbine represents a motive power of remarkable constancy.
 On the other hand, the mirror, when accelerated, soon encounters in
 the surrounding air a resistance which for a given velocity is also
 perfectly constant.    The moving body placed between these two
 forces, which tend to equilibrium, cannot fail to receive and to pre
  serve a uniform velocity.   Any check whatever, acting upon the <U+FB02>ow
  of the water, allows this velocity to be regulated within very exten
  sive limits.                                             _
     “ It remains to estimate the number of turns, or rather to impress
  on the moving body a determined velocity.      This problem has been
  completely solved in the following manner. Between the micro
  scope and the re<U+FB02>ecting glass a circular disc is placed, the edge of
  which, cut in <U+FB01>ne teeth, encroaches upon the mark and partly inter
  cepts it. The disc turns uniformly on itself, so that, if the image
  shines steadily, the teeth at its circumference escape detection from
   the rapidity of the motion.     But the image is not permanent: it
  results from a series of discontinuous appearances equal in number
  to the revolutions of the mirror; and whenever the teeth of the
   screen succeed one another with the same frequency, there is pro
  duced on the eye an illusion easily explained, which makes the teeth
  appear immoveable. Suppose then that the disc, with 11 teeth in its
   circumference, turns once in a second, and that the turbine starts
  up. If, by regulating the <U+FB02>ow of air, the teeth are made to appear
   <U+FB01>xed, we are certain that the mirror makes it turns in a second.

a chronometrio wheelwork to move the disc. It is a remarkable‘
piece of clockwork, which solves in an elegant manner the pro
blem of uniform motion in the particular case in which there is no
work to be done. The success is so complete that it is my daily
experience to launch the minor with 400 turns a second, and see
the two pieces of apparatus march within 1-0%-0-U nearly of accordance
during whole minutes.
    "Notwithstanding the assurance I had gained in the measure
ment of time, I was surprised at proving, in my results, discordances
which were out of proportion to the precision of my means of measur
ing.    After long research, I discovered the source of error in the
micrometer, which did not allow of the degree of accuracy willingly
 attributed to it. To meet this di<U+FB01>iculty, I have introduced into the
 system of observation a. modi<U+FB01>cation which amounts simply to a
 change of the variable. Instead of measuring micrometrically the
 deviation, I adopt for it a de<U+FB01>nite value in advance-—suppose seven
tenths of a millimetre, or seven entire parts of the image; and I seek
by experiment to <U+FB01>nd the distance between the mark and the turn
ing mirror necessary to produce this deviation : the measures extend
ing over a length of about a metre, the last fractions have a magni
 tude directly visible, and leave no room for error.
   “ By this means the apparatus has been purged of the principal
cause of uncertainty; henceforth the results accorded, within the
limits of errors of observation, and the means are settled in such a
way that I am able to assign con<U+FB01>dently the new number which
appears to me to express nearly the velocity of light in space, viz.
298,000 kilometres in a second of mean time.”
    This value, reduced to statute miles, shows that the velocity
of light is 185,177 miles in a second; which is less by 6336
miles than the velocity for light usually admitted into science,
viz. the velocity obtained from the aberration of light. This
discrepancy between the results of experiment and that of the
astronomical determination which comes nearest to it, is three
times greater than the variation between the velocity deduced
from aberration and that derived from eclipses.
    Foucault states that the extreme difference of the results of
various trials amounted to only T51, of the whole quantity, and
that the mean result can be trusted to the fraction of 5-5-0.
Moreover the aberration of 20”'45 adopted by astronomers
cannot be supposed at fault by more than T1,10-6 of the whole.
Neither the velocity by Foucault’s experiments nor the value of
aberration can be charged with a possible error of 3 per cent.,
or of any error approaching to this large discrepancy. How is
the new velocit of light to be reconciled with the old value of
aberration? I ave said that aberration establishes only the ratio
between the velocity of light and the velocity of the earth. If
this ratio cannot be tampered with, and if one term of it (the
velocity of light) must be diminished by 3 per cent. to suit Fou

                         and the Sun’s Distance.    ' i             531
cault’s experiment, then we must at the same time diminish the
other term (the velocity of the earth) proportionally; and the
old ratio will be preserved, and the value of aberration will be
left unchanged.        Is it possible, therefore, that there can be an
uncertainty to the extent of 3 per cent. in the velocity of the
earth? If so, the tables are turned ; and instead of employing
the ratio which aberration supplies to calculate the velocity of
light from the velocity of the earth, as the best known of the
two, we henceforth must calculate the velocity of the earth from
the velocity of light; for Foucault has found the latter by ex
periment morc accurately than astronomy gives the former.             If
 there is an error of 3 per cent. in the velocity of the earth, it is an
 error in space and not in time. To diminish the velocity of the
 earth su<U+FB02>iciently by a change of time would demand an increase
 in the length of the year amounting to eleven days nearly.
     The only other way of reducing the velocity of the earth is by
 diminishing the circumference of the earth’s orbit; and this, if
 diminished, changes proportionally the mean radius of the orbit,
 that is, the sun’s mean distance. The question therefore resolves
 itself into this, Can the distance of the sun from the earth be
 considered uncertain to theextent of 3 per cent. of the whole
  distance ?         .
     The answer to this question will lead me into a brief discus
  sion of the processes by which the sun’s distance from the earth.
  has been determined, and the limits of accuracy which belong to
  the received value. To see the distance of any body is an act of
  binocular vision. When the body is near, the two eyes of the
  same individual converge upon it. The interval between the
  eyes is the little base-line, and the angle which the optic axes of
  the two eyes, when directed to the body, make with each other
  is the parallax; and by this simple triangulation, in which an
  instinctive geometrical sense supersedes the use of sines and loga
  rithms, the distance of an object is roughly calculated. As the
   distance of the object increases, the base-line must be enlarged ;
   but the geometrical method is the same, even when the object is
   a star and the base of the triangle the diameter of the earth’s
   orbit,   Substitute then for the two eye of the same observer
   the two telescopes of di<U+FB01>erent astronomers, planted at the oppos
   site extremities of the earth’s diameter, and any one will under
   stand the principle upon which the binocular eye of science takes
   its stereoscopic view of the universe, and plunges into the depths
   of space. _ In this way it is that the distance of the sun from
   the earth is associated with the solar parallax, which is the
   angle between the directions in which two astronomers point
   their telescopes when they are looking at the sun at the same
   moment, To knowthe sun_’s_d.is_tance, the astronomer studies

 532           Prof. Lovering on the Velocity of Light
 the solar parallax.  As Kepler’s third law establishes a relation
 between the distances of the different planets from the sun and
 their periods of revolution, if the astronomer <U+FB01>nds either dis
 tance by observation, the others can be computed from this law.
 As the solar parallax is only about eight seconds, and an error
 of one-tenth of a second includes an error of more than a million
 of miles in the sun’s distance, he takes advantage of the law of
 Kepler, and selects a planet which comes occasionally nearer to
 the earth than the sun. The choice lies between Venus at info
rior conjunction and Mars at opposition.     The parallax of Mars
may vary from 20”'7 to 19"'1, according to the positions of Mars
and the earth with respect to the perihelion of the orbit at the
time of opposition. The parallax of Venus at conjunction may
vary, for the same reasons, from 33"'9 to 29"'9. Venus, there
fore, may be nearer to the earth than Mars, and the parallax
more favourable. But Venus cannot be seen at conjunction
except when its latitude is so small that a transit across the sun’s
disc occurs. Then the two observers refer its place not to a star
but to the sun, and the quantity they determine is the di<U+FB02>erence
of parallax between Venus and the sun; which will vary from
about 21" to 25". Moreover the difference of parallax is mea
sured, not directly, but through the in<U+FB02>uence it produces on the
duration of the transit at the two stations, and therefore upon .
a greatly enlarged scale.
    What are the results which have been obtained, <U+FB01>rst, by
observations of the transits of Venus? and second, by observa
tions on Mars at opposition?
    1. Only two transits of Venus have occurred since the time
when the sagacious Dr. Halley invoked the attention of posterity
to these rare astronomical events as pregnant with the grandest
results to science, viz. those of 1761 and 1769.      The astrono
mers of the last century did not neglect the charge which Halley
consigned to them. The transit of 1769 was eminently favourable,
offering a chance which comes only once in a millennium, as Pro
essorWinth rophappily explained in his lectures on the lasttransits.
    VVhatever verdict posterity shall pronounce on the deductions
from the observations then made, they will never, says Encke,
reproach astronomers or governments with negligence or want
of appreciation towards this golden opportunity. The solar
parallax which Encke deduced from an elaborate discussion
of all the observations, <U+FB01>fty years after they were made, is
8"'57116. This corresponds to a solar distance of 95,360,000
statute miles.
   Although transits of Venus will take place in 1874 and 1882,
and astronomers already begin to talk of preparing for them, I
have the authority of Encke for declaring that, in comparison

                       and the Sun’s Distance.                   533
with that of 1769, the next two transits will be so unfavourable
that nothing short of perfection in the construction of instru
ments, and in the art of observing, can compensate for the natu
ral disadvantage ; so that the reduction of the possible error in
the sun’s parallax within the limit of ,—$5th of a second is hope
less for at least two centuries more.
    2. The solar parallax may also be derived from the parallax
 of Mars, when this planet is in opposition. In 174.0 the French
 astronomer Lacaille was sent to the Cape of Good Hope, and
 from the parallactic angle observed between the direction of
 Mars as seen from that station and from the observatory of
 Paris (deduced from observations of declination), the horizontal
 parallax of Mars was computed, and conse uently that of the
 sun. The solar parallax thus found was 10' '20, with a possible
  error not exceeding ()"'25. Henderson, by comparing his own
  observations of the declination of Mars at its opposition in 1832 '
  with corresponding observations at Greenwich, Cambridge, and
  Altona, computed the solar parallax at 9" ‘O28.
     The United States Naval Astronomical expedition to Chili,
  under the charge of Lieut. J. M. Gilliss, during the years 1849
  1852, had for its object the advancement of our knowledge of
  the solar parallax, partly by observations of Mars at opposition,
  and partly by observations of Venus during the retrograde por
  tion of her orbit, and especially at the stationary points, in con
  formity with a method suggested by Dr. Gcrling—the whole to
  be compared with simultaneous observations at northern obser
  vatories. Although the observations at Chili were made on 217
  nights, covering a period of nearly three years, the cooperation
  of northern astronomers was so insuf<U+FB01>cient that only 28 corre
  sponding observations were made. On this account the second
  conjunction of Venus was useless; the other conjunction of
  Venus and the second opposition of Mars were of little value;
  and even the <U+FB01>rst opposition of Mars led to no signi<U+FB01>cant result.
  Dr. B. A. Gould has computed the solar parallax from the <U+FB01>rst
  opposition of Mars, observed at Chili, at 8"'50.
     3. The solar parallax can also be computed from the law of
- nniversal gravitation. The principle may be thus stated. The
  motion of the moon round the earth is disturbed by the unequal
  attraction of the sun on the two bodies. The magnitude of the
  disturbance will be in some proportion to the distance of the
  disturber when compared with the relative distance of the two
  disturbed bodies; and this ratio of distances is the inverse ratio
  of the parallaxes of the sun and moon. By selecting one of
  the perturbations in the moon’s longitude particularly adapted
  to this purpose, Mayer, as early as 1760, computed the solar
  parallax at 7"-8. In 1824: Burg calculated this parallax from
  better observations at 8"'62. Laplace gives it at 8"'61. Fon

5114                    Prof. Lovering on 'tke'_Vel0c'it_1} ofLight
tenelle had said that Newton, without getting out of his arm
-chair, found the <U+FB01>gure of the earth more accurately than others
had done by going to the ends of the earth. Laplace makes a
   similar re<U+FB02>ection on this new triumph of theory.                  “It is won'~
derful that an astronomer, without going out of his observatory,
   should be able to determine. exactly the size and <U+FB01>gure of the
  earth, and its distance from the sun and moon, simply by com
   paring his observations with analysis, the knowledge of which
   formerly demanded long and laborious voyages into both hemi
   spheres.” The accordance of the results obtained by the two
   methods is one of the most striking proofs of universal gravita
   tion. Pontecoulant makes the solar parallax by this method
   8"'63. Lubbock, by combining Airy’s empirical determination
   of the coe<U+FB01>icient with the mass of the moon as he <U+FB01>nds it from
   the tides (viz. 31;), makes the solar parallax 8" '84. If the mass
   of 7'; is substituted, the parallax is changed to 8" '81. Finally,
   Hansen, in his new ‘ Tables of the Moon,’ adopts 8"'87'62 as the
   value of the solar parallax. Moreover, Leverrier, in his ‘ Theory
of the Apparent Motion of the Sun,’ deduces a solar parallax of
   8"'95 from the phenomena of precession and nutation.
       The conclusions of this whole review are summed up in the
   following Table, in which the values of the solar parallax and
   of the sun’s distance, by the three methods of astronomy, and -
‘by the experiment of Foucault, are placed in juxtaposition; also
   the different velocities of light found by astronomical observa
 tions and by experiment.

       Fou_cault’s -experiment on the velocity of light has been
  popularly announced as making a “revolution in astronomical
   science.” But it appears from the preceding sketch that it has
   raised no new question in astronomy, though it may have at
  ftracted popular attention to an old di<U+FB02>iculty, and possibly given
  'a solution to it. The three astronomical methods present solar
   distances which, even if we select the most trustworthy decision
  ‘of each, differ by three or four millions of miles—that is, by
   3 or 4 per cent. of the whole quantity.         Though the best pro
   ducts of the <U+FB01>rst and third methods were at one time within a
   million of miles of each other, an increase of lunar observations,
   and especially improvements in the lunar tables, have now

   decide in favour of the third method, thus making the re<U+FB02>ection
   of Laplace, which I have already quoted, still more memorable.
       In regard to the commonly received distance of the sun, which
   is based upon Encke’s profound discussion of all the observa
   tions made at the last two transits of Venus, the case stands
   thus. Encke decides, from the weights of the observations, dis
   cussed in the light of the mathematical principle of least squares,
   that the probable error of the sun’s distance, as given by the
    transits, does not exceed Th, of the whole quantity. Astrono‘
' mers have also reason to believe that the adopted value of aber-L
   ration is correct within _810-(,- of the whole quantity. Moreover,
   ‘Foucault is con<U+FB01>dent of is determination of the velocity of light
   within Fl-U of the whole quantity; nay, he expects to improve
   his instruments so as to banish all errors larger than -<U+FB01>lm of the
   whole quantity.     Neither the velocity of light, aberration, nor
   the sun’s distance can be suspected of an error to the extent of
   3 or 4 per cent. ; and yet one at least must be wrong to this
   ‘degree, as the best values of the three elements are irreconcilable
   with each other. Which shall be changed?
       It may excite surprise in those who have heard of the accu
   racy of astronomy, without weighing the exact signi<U+FB01>cance of
   the word as applied to so large a subject, that there should still
   be a lingering uncertainty, to the extent of three or four millions
   of miles, in the sun’s distance from the earth. But the error,
   whatever it is, is propagated from the solar system into the deep
   est spaces which the telescope has ever traversed. The sun’s
    distance is the measuring-rod with which the astronomer metes
   out the distances of the <U+FB01>xed stars and the dimensions of stellar
   orbits. An error of 3 per cent. in the sun’s distance entails an
   error of 3 per cent. in all these other distances and dimensions.
   Tri<U+FB01>ing as. 3 per cent. may seem, the correction runs up to
   600,00_O millions of miles in the distance of the nearest <U+FB01>xed star !

                     [Continued from vol. xxv. p. 545.]
      f)TTGER*, who has investigated the deposit in the lead cham
       bers of numerous sulphuric acid works, states that he has as
 yet only observed the occurrence of thallium in two cases. It does
 not appear always to accompany selenium: a very rich selenife
 rous deposit from Zwickau contained no thallium; and in a
 thallifcrous deposit from a manufactory at Aix-la-Chapelle no
 trace of selenium could be detected. Bottger extracted the thal
 lium from a deposit in sulphuric acid chambers at Oker in the
 Hartz, in the following manner. The reddish crumbly deposit
 was boiled with six times its quantity of distilled water, and
 powdered carbonate of soda added until the disengagement of gas
 had ceased, and the mixture had assumed an alkaline reaction.
 The boiling was continued with continual stirring until the ori
ginal red colour of the deposit was changed into black. The
whole was then <U+FB01>ltered and the residue washed on the <U+FB01>lter; to
 the united <U+FB01>ltrate and washings a small quantity of cyanide of
potassium was added, the liquid again <U+FB01>ltered, and sulphuretted
hydrogen passed through the <U+FB01>ltrate so long as black sulphide
 of thallium continued to be precipitated. This was washed by
 decantation and collected on a <U+FB01>lter. The black deposit result
 ing from the treatment with carbonate of soda still contained
 thallium ; it was accordingly boiled with moderately strong solu
tion of oxalic acid so long as the spectroscopic reaction of thallium
could be obtained. The <U+FB01>ltered liquid was then made alkaline
by carbonate of soda, a quantity of cyanide of potassium added,
the whole boiled, <U+FB01>ltered, and the <U+FB01>ltrate precipitated by sul
phuretted hydrogen.
   This precipitate consisted of sulphide of thallium containing
sulphide of mercury; it was treated with pure nitric acid (of
spec. grav. 1'20), by which sulphide of thallium alone was dis
solved out. This nitric acid solution was mixed with concentrated
sulphuric acid, the whole evaporated to dryness, dissolved in
boiling water, the liquid concentrated, and the thallium precipi
tated by zinc.
   In a subsequent paper'|' Biittger describes the extraction of
thallium from a deposit which had formed behind a pyrites fur
nace in a sulphuric acid works in which Belgian pyrites was
used.    This had a reddish colour, and consisted of sulphates of
zinc, sesquioxide of iron and thallium mixed with charcoal and
sand.
   This residue was very <U+FB01>nely powdered, and boiled with four

 times its weight of distilled water, and several large rods of pure
 zmc placed in the cold <U+FB01>ltrate. Within eight to twelve hours all
 the thallium in the solution was precipitated in the form of a
 black porous heavy powder, mixed with some hydrated oxide of
 zinc, from which it could be readily separated by elutriation.
 This thallium was dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid with the
 addition of a few drops of nitric acid, evaporated to dryness, re
 dissolved in water, and the thallium again precipitated by the
addition of some pieces of distilled zinc. The thallium is sepa
rated out to the last trace, often in the form of beautiful metallic
 lustrous needles.
    B6ttger* investigated a saline mixture obtained in cold
weather from the mother-liquors from which common salt has
been extracted at the Nauheim Salt Works. It is a very deli
quescent substance, and is in considerable use by the confec
tioners for freezing-mixtures. It was found to consist of the
chlorides of magnesium, potassium, and sodium, besides compa
ratively large quantities of the chlorides of caesium and rubidium,
with traces of chloride of thallium. Bottger states that the Nau
heim mother-liquor is at present the readiest source of caesium and
rubidium. According to his observations, thallium almost inva
riablyaccompanies potassium, caesium, and rubidium—fr0mwhich
fact, and from its other properties, pite of its being precipitated
by sulphuretted hydrogen, an indication is given that this metal
must be classed with the alkalies.
   Hautefeuille describes the arti<U+FB01>cial preparation of Rutile, Brook
ite, and their varietiesir.
    Rutile is obtained by heating in a current of hydrochloric acid
a mixture of titanate of potash and chloride of potassium. The
mixture is placed in a platinum crucible enclosed in an earthen
one, in the lid of which are luted two porcelain tubes through
which the current of gas passes. The crystals have the same
form as those obtained by M. Devillejj, by passing hydrochloric
acid over amorphous titanic acid heated to redness. The density
of the crystals obtained by M. Hautefeuille is 4'3, the same as
that of natural rutile.
    Acicular Rutile.—By heating a mixture of titanate and <U+FB02>uo
titanate of potassium to bright redness in a current of hydro
chloric acid, prismatic crystals are obtained terminated by octa
hedra. In their shape and colour, which is a golden yellow, they
resemble the acicular rutile enclosed in the quartz of Madagascar.

Some of these crystals are of a blue colour, so dark that they
would be considered black, but that the intensity of the colour is
somewhat less at the edges.
   Lamellar Rutile.—When titanic acid dissolved in <U+FB02>uosilicate of
potash is heated to bright redness in a current of hydrochloric
acid, lamellar crystals of rutile are obtained resembling the
natural rutile of New Jersey.
   Sagem'te.—A mixture of titanic acid, silica, and <U+FB02>uosilicate of
potash, heated in a current of hydrochloric acid, gives rise to a
number of small needles planted edgewise in a skeleton of silica.
In their colour and shape they present an undoubted analogy
with the Sagenite of Saussure.
   Brookite is obtained in transparent very fragile plates by heat
ing to dull redness a mixture of titanic acid, silica, and <U+FB02>uosili-'
cate of potash in a current of hydrochloric acid. There is no
silica in the crystals, and their density and shape identi<U+FB01>es them
with the Brookite of St. Gothard.
 ' Black crystals of Ar/cansite are obtained when the preceding
experiment is made in a crucible of gas-charcoal.                   -
   When <U+FB02>uotitanate of potash is heated in a current of dry
hydrogen charged with a small quantity of hydrochloric acid,
the bi<U+FB02>uoride of titanium liberated is reduced to proto<U+FB02>uoride of
titanium, which crystallizes in beautiful prisms of a deep violet
colour.
   When acicular rutile is prepared in a charcoal crucible, the
mixture being heated for some time before passing the current
of hydrochloric acid, blue crystals are obtained containing 5 per
cent. of <U+FB02>uorine. The colour produced is due to the presence of
proto<U+FB02>uoride of titanium.                    '
   Some of these syntheses are not new. Rutile h.as been
obtained crystallized by several methods, but none of them have
given the complete series of these varieties of the mineral.
   Wiederhold* has described a method for preparing the solid
hydride of arsenic, which was <U+FB01>rst obtained by Davy, by passing
an electrical current through water and using arsenic as the
negative pole.     Davy also observed that when arsenide of potas
sium was treated with water, hydride of arsenic was left as a
brownish-red powder.       It has been stated that when arsenide of
ZIIIC is treated with hydrochloric acid, hydride of arsenic is lefti
_Soubeiran showed that the residue is an insoluble alloy contain
mg excess of arsenic. Wiederhold has now shown that, by taking
an alloy of special composition, the hydride may be obtained.
In preparlng this alloy, which consists of <U+FB01>ve parts of zinc and one
of arsenic, certain precautions are necessary, and especially that

the materials be chemically pure.          The arsenic is placed in a;
Hessian crucible, and above it the zinc ; heat is gradually applied
up to the melting-point of the zinc, and the crucible is then kept
for a quarter of an hour at the temperature of the wind-furnace.‘
The crucible is then withdrawn, and its contents poured into
cold water.                                                          _
   When this substance is treated with hydrochloric acid, a
violent disengagement of hydrogen and arseniuretted hydrogen
ensues, the liquid becomes yellow.-coloured, which, passing
through brick-red, changes into dark brown; and <U+FB01>nally a reddish
brown powder is left, which is the body in question. From
about 300 grms. of alloy, 1 grm. of pure hydride of arsenic was
obtained.                                                            .
   The substance was analysed by heating a weighed quantity in
a suitable apparatus, and collecting and measuring with all
suitable precautions the hydrogen disengaged. From 1 grm.,
0'00484- grm. of hydrogen were obtained. The formula As2 H
requires 0'00688 grm., and the formula As H9 requires 0'025
grm. Solid hydride of arsenic, As2 H, is a light voluminous
reddish-brown powder, in appearance resembling binoxide of
lead. It is insoluble in the ordinary reagents; it decomposes
at 200° G. into pure hydrogen and arsenic. It burns in the air
with a yellow <U+FB02>ame, forming arsenious acid, metallic arsenic,
and a small quantity of a black substance which is probably a
new oxide of arsenic. Dilute acids are without action upon it,
with the exception of nitric acid, which oxidizes it to arsenious
and arsenic acids. It is gradually decomposed by the alkalies,
forming metallic arseniate. It burns in chlorine, forming chlo
ride of arsenic; in bromine, forming bromide of arsenic and
bromide of hydrogen ; and in iodine in a similar manner. Wieder
hold has not succeeded in combining it with other bodies.
   Carius* has found that ethylene and its homologous and ana
logous hydrocarbons can directly combine with hydrate of hypo
chlorous acid and with peroxide of hydrogen, while he describes
the reactions as being sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned.
   The combination is best effected by means of the solution of
hypochlorous acid, which must not be too strong, for otherwise
it gives 011' free chlorine, which produces secondary actions.
This solution is prepared by adding to stoppered vessels of a
litre capacity <U+FB01>lled with chlorine 15 grammes of precipitated
oxide of mercury which has been heated to 300°, diffused in a
little water. The whole is well shaken, and the operation per
formed in a dark place. By using la1'ger quantities than these,
or oxide which has not been heated to 300°, the experiment fails,

in consequence of the formation of large quantities of chlorate
of mercury.
   This solution contains 2 to 3 per cent. of hypochlorous acid;
it only acts slowly on ethylene gas, and is yet well adapted for
preparing hydrochloric glycol, the formation of which simply
results from the addition of the two bodies,

   Stoppered vessels holding about a litre are <U+FB01>lled with ethylene
gas, and the hypochlorous acid solution, prepared as above,
added, the whole well shaken in a dark place and allowed to
stand in cold water. In a few hours the smell of hypochlorous
acid has disappeared; the liquid is then <U+FB01>ltered, and the <U+FB01>ltered
liquid distilled.     The distillate is exhausted with ether, the
etherial solution dehydrated by carbonate of potash, the ether
evaporated in the water-bath, and the residue recti<U+FB01>ed. The
body thus prepared is identical in properties with that obtained
by Wurtz from glycol.
   An aqueous olution of hypochlorous acid readily absorbs
amylene, and an excess of acid is not injurious so long as it does
not give off chlorine. The hydrochlorate of amylglycol, which
is the result of the action, could not be isolated by Bauer by the
action of hydrochloric acid on amylglycol*, but can easily be
obtained by means of this reaction. After the action of the hy
pochlorous acid on amylene is complete, which requires to be
moderated by cooling, sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through
the <U+FB01>ltered liquid so as to precipitate any dissolved mercurial
salt, care being taken to avoid an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen ,
the <U+FB01>ltrate is then neutralized with carbonate of soda, and the
hydrochlorate extracted with ether. The rest of the puri<U+FB01>cation
is quite analogous with that for the corresponding ethylene de
rivative. The reaction is as follows :-—

   The nc\v body is a colourless, not very mobile liquid, with an
odour like that of valerianie acid. It is heavier than water, in
which it is soluble, and which it also dissolves, and can only
with di<U+FB02>iculty be freed from by distillation: when pure it boils at

 155°.    That this body is really the homologue of hydrochloric
 glycol, was proved by treating it with caustic potash. It was
thus converted into oxide of amylene, which was identical in all
 its properties with that obtained by Bauer.
   Carius likewise obtained a corresponding_compound,G'6H33 C19,
from cetcne, Gm H32. A compound obtained by the action of
 hypochlorous acid on benzole, which appears to have the for
mula G5 H9 Cl3 93, is still under investigation.
    He has also found that other classes of bodies assimilate hy
pochlorous acid; and he describes some experiments on citra
conic acid, G5 H6 94, only the results of which can be here given.
By the above action he obtains a new acid which he calls chloro
citramalic acid; thus

    This is a strong acid, which, dried in vacuo, forms a solid,
colourless, uncrystallizable substance; it readily exchanges two
atoms of hydrogen for metal. When it is treated with zinc, gas
is disengaged; the chlorine of the acid becomes replaced by hy
drogen, forming a new acid, citramalic acid, homologous with

names it citratartaric acid. With the investigation of both these
new acids he is still engaged.
    Rieth and Beilstein* have investigated the decomposition of
the aldehydes and acetates by zincethyle. Ordinary aldehyde
acted but slowly on zincethyle, and the action had to be pro
moted by gentle heating, by which it was effected in a few hours.
When there was no more free zincethyle, the decomposition was
complete, and the excess of aldehyde was distilled off in the water
bath. The residue consisted of a tough mass, which was a simple

 ducting power the higher the percentage decrement in the conducting
 power between 0° and 100°. This has been proved to be the case with
 about 100 alloys with which we have experimented. We have also
 found that we may deduce the conducting power of a pure metal from
 an impure one when the impurity does not reduce the conducting
 power more than, say, 10 to 20 per cent. According to our experi
 ments, the percentage decrement in the conducting power of an
 impure metal between 0° and 100° varies in the same ratio as the
conducting power of the impure metal at 100°, compared with that
 of the pure metal at 100°.
    Thus, from specimens Nos. 5, 6, 7, 9, 13, and 15, the conducting
 power of pure iron was found to be at 0°=16'725.

    The density of the vapour given off when a chemical compound
is heated is not necessarily the vapour-density of that chemical com
pound; sometimes it is only the mean density of the products of
decomposition. Some of the best-known substances, such as hydrated

apparent vapour-density, which is in reality nothing more than the
mean density of the products of their decomposition.
     We recognize such cases—in which the apparent is not the real
vapour-density—by making a di<U+FB01>'usion-analysis of the vapours.
This method of solving questions of the kind was proposed by one
of us two years ago*. In carrying it out practically, it was resolved
from the <U+FB01>rst not to diffuse through a porous diaphragm, but to
recur to Graham’s original method, namely, to let our vapours dif
fuse through a simple aperture or through a short tube.
     Independently of the experimental difficulties attending the use
of a porous diaphragm at high temperatures, there is a fatal objec
tion to it, founded upon the inconclusiveness of the results obtained
in such a way.                                           _

        The <U+FB01>rst substance taken for experiment was sulphuric acid, which
   is converted at high temperatures into vapour of sulphuric anhydride
   and vapour of water. Inasmuch as vapour of water is lighter than
   vapour of sulphuric anhydride, the former should di<U+FB01>'use more
    rapidly than the latter. Accordingly, the residue after diffusion
    should be richer in sulphuric anhydride than the acid before diffusion.

    1. “On the Relations of the Cromarty Sandstones containing
Reptilian Footprints.” By the Rev. George Gordon, LL.D., and
the Rev. J. M. Joass. With an Introduction by Sir R. I. Murchison,
K.C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In the introduction Sir R. I. Murchison gave a sketch of the
geology of the Tarbatness promontory, which is composed of vari
ously coloured sandstones, having a conformable dip to the N.W.
 In these strata the authors had found footprints (of animals believed
to be Reptiles) similar to those found in the sandstones on the coast
of Elgin; and it was therefore desirable to prove whether these
 rocks really belonged to the Palaeozoic series, or, as some geologists
 suppose with regard to the Elgin sandstones, to the Trias. In
order to solve this problem, if possible, the Rev. Mr. Joass made a
 careful survey of the coast from Geanies to Tarbatness Lighthouse,
 and round along the north shore of the promontory to the inlet at
 Inver, and found a conformable succession between the undoubted
 Old Red Sandstone of Geanies and the track-bearing sandstone of
 Tarbatness.
    The Rev. Dr. Gordon gave a description of the various tracks:
 the smaller kind are referred by him to an unknown Crustacean;

   An examination of 71 species of Tertiary Mollusca. from Jamaica,
mostly collected by the late Mr. Barrett, showed that 12 are still
living, and that 28 are common to the Tertiary beds of Jamaica and
St. Domingo. The same relation between those deposits had been
found to exist by Dr. Duncan through a comparison of the Corals.
The ‘ Paci<U+FB01>c’ a<U+FB01>inity of many of these Shells and Corals was noticed
as con<U+FB01>rmatory of a conclusion arrived at by the author in a former
paper; and it was shown, from the occurrence of Tertiary beds on
the Panama Isthmus at a height of 250 feet above the sea, that the
complete separation of the Atlantic and Paci<U+FB01>c Oceans did not take
place until after the commencement of the Tertiary period. The
distribution and a<U+FB01>inities of the Nummulime and Orbitoides were
described by Prof. Jones, and those of the Corals by Dr. Duncan.

   A collection of specimens from Borneo and Java, presented by
the author to the Museum of Practical Geology, was accompanied
by some explanatory notes, in which it was stated that the Steam
coal of Borneo underlies the Nummulitic Formation, and probably
belongs to the ‘ Etage Suessonien' of D'Orbigny. The occurrence
of tin in stream-works, and as veins in granite, at several places
in the Western portion of Borneo and the Islands of Blitong and
Banka, was particularly described, as well as the presence of ores
of copper and manganese. Some Tertiary fossils from Borneo and
Java were also noticed.

Beds of Malta.” By J. Denis Macdonald, Esq., F.R.S.
   Amongst the many fossils occurring in the lower part of the
Calcareous Sandstone of Malta is a small Thecidium, nearly allied
to the recent T. Mediterranea, but much smaller than that species,
and, on close inspection, presenting other and very decided speci<U+FB01>c

   The true position of the well-known Plant-bed at Gristhorpe
Bay, below the grey limestone, was <U+FB01>rst pointed out by Prof. Wil

   In a previous paper the author collected together what was

Murchison, K.C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S., &c.
   The section exposed by some deep cuttings for the Ross-shire
Railway, two miles north of Dingwall, exhibits a grey micaceous
and almost horizontal conglomerate, traversed by <U+FB01>ssures containing
a black bituminous substance, which the author stated might have
in<U+FB01>ltrated down from a bed of bituminous schist which apparently‘

By A. C. Mackenzie, Esq.
   In making a drain on a farm near Mountgerald, a <U+FB01>ssure was dis
covered which contained a bituminous substance very similar to the
Albertite of New Brunswick ; a deposit of a similar nature was also
discovered in making a cutting through “ The Craig," near Mount
gerald. The author described the stratigraphical and lithological
characters of the rocks met with in making this cutting, and stated
 that thirty-six veins containing this mineral were passed through.
    10. “ On the Occurrence of Rocks of Upper Cretaceous Age in
Eastern Benga .” By Dr. T. Oldham, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   During the years 1851-52 the author examined the rocks of the
Khasi Hills, in Eastern Bengal, and made a collection of the fossils
occurring there. These fossils were mostly from a Nummulitic
Limestone, and were evidently of Eocene date; but some were
obtained from a sandstone underlying this limestone, and appeared
to be of Cretaceous rather than Tertiary age.

   Two specimens and three photographs, sent to England for the

         Dr. A. L. Adams on the Geology of the Nile Valley.        551
author’s determination, enabled him to distinguish four genera, two
of which are new, and allied to Acrolepis and Platysomus respect
ively; the known genera being Urosthenus, Dana (allied to Py
gopterus), and Palazoniscus, Agass. Sir Philip was of opinion that
these genera were su<U+FB02>icient to stamp the deposit in which they
occur—namely, the Coal-formation of New South Wales--as be
longing to the Palaeozoic period, if they may be regarded as repre
sentative genera living at the same period as, but geographically
distant from,'their nearest allies; but, as regards the actual age of
the formation, the allied genera are more abundantly represented in
the Magnesian Limestone and the Kupferschiefer than in the Coal
measures; the materials were, he considered, too meagre to justify
a conclusion.

Teeth of Hippopotamus, by Hugh Falconer, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    In company with the late Mr. A. H. Rhind, F.S.A., the author
 made the usual boat-voyage from Cairo to the Second Cataract
 during last November and the two following months, when he was
enabled to make some observations on the geology of that portion
of the Nile Valley.     In this paper he <U+FB01>rst described the physical
features of the district, beginning at Selsileh and proceeding south
 wards, and then the lithological and stratigraphical characters of
 the Nile sandstone, as well as its mode of junction with the granite,
 noticing also the evidences of the Nile having shifted its bed, and of
 other physical changes occurring in Nubia. Near the Second Cata
 ract were abundant proofs of the river having formerly <U+FB02>owed at
 higher levels, the author having found river shells, such as Cyrena
 <U+FB02>uminalis, Paludina bulimoides, Iridina Nilotica, and Gdtheria semi-‘
 lunata (the Nile Oyster), as also Bulimus pullus and a Unio like
 U. pictorum, in beds of alluvium on elevated plateaus at various
 heights, ranging up to 130 feet, above the highest inundations of
 the present day.
 ~ Dr. Adams concluded from these facts that the Nile was formerly
 a more rapid river than it is now, and that the force and wearing
 power of the stream has been steadily declining since the upheaval
 of the valleyceased.                                            _ .
     The determinations of the shells were made by Mr. Woodward,
 who gave a complete list of them in a Note.         Dr. Falconer also
  described two molars imbedded, in situ, in a fragment of the left
 maxillary of a very large Hippopotamus; the specimen was dug up
  near the old Temple of Kalébshe, in Nubia; and Dr. Falconer was
  of opinion that it belonged to the same species as the existing Hip

northern Antilles, but rare around the north-eastern, although the
corals are mostly of different genera from those found in the fossil
state. The author concluded with some remarks on the physical
conditions of the Miocene period in the West Indies, observing that
the Nivaje shales and associated deposits are the remains of an
ancient barrier-reef, and giving an analytical table of the af<U+FB01>nities
of the species, in which it was shown that the Paci<U+FB01>c and East
Indian element greatly preponderated.

Bullock. Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison, K.C.B., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   There having been no geologist attached to the late surveying
expedition of H.M.S. “Dove,” the Commander of that vessel en
deavoured to repair the consequent loss to science, so far as his
professional duties would allow, by collecting fossils, and by record
ing their localities and the circumstances under which they were
found. The specimens were presented to the Geological Society
through Sir R. I. Murchison; and this paper contained all the infor
mation, respecting their occurrence, which Captain Bullock had been
enabled to obtain.

   A short notice of the scanty literature of Javan Geology having
been given, the author described brie<U+FB02>y the geological and physical
features of the Mount-Séla district, and made some general ob
servations on, and gave descriptions of, the fossils which were the
subject of the paper, and which had been sent to England by

   Of sixteen determinable species, only three (or 19 per cent.) are
now known to exist, the remainder being new species; but Mr.
Jenkins showed that the fossils were probably more recent than this
small percentage of living species would appear to indicate, in con
sequence of there having occurred an emigration eastwards of at
least a part of the Southern- and Middle-European Miocene and
Eocene fauna. This emigration was proved by the identity of many
species which occur fossil in the European Miocene, and now exist
in the Eastern seas, and also by certain genera being represented in
that formation and the Eocene, and con<U+FB01>ned in the living state to
the Indo-Paci<U+FB01>c region.
   One of the Javan species being closely related to Vicarya Ver
neuilii from Scinde, the author was induced to investigate the claims
of the Nummulitic Formation of India to be considered altogether
of Eocene date; and he inferred that there was a probability of
some of the beds belonging to a less remote period. This inference
was supported by Dr. Duncan in a Note upon the Scindian fossil
Corals, many of which (unnamed by M. I-laime) were shown to
have Miocene and recent, but not Eocene, a<U+FB01>inities.
   Mr. Jenkins next referred to the diminutive character of many
of these Javan fossils, and then reviewed the opinions of former
writers upon the Tertiary Formation of that island, coming to the
conclusion that the Mount-Sela shells were probably of late Miocene
date, and that the plants described by Dr. Goeppert were probably
newer than the Eocene.
   The fossil Coral from Mount Séla was shown by Dr. Duncan, in a.
Note to this paper, to be allied to Astrma quadrangularis, Edwards
and Haime, the habitat of which is ‘unknown.

     ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE WATER OF THE DEAD SEA.
                             BY M. ROUX.
    HE water was taken from the northern part of the Dead Sea,not fat
     from the mouth of the Jordan, on the 24th of April 1862. It was
slightly alkaline to turmeric paper, became of a. red colour by the
addition of a few drops of solution of logwood, and when heated for
some minutes was not appreciably turbid. The residue after evapo
ration, heated to a tolcrably high temperature in a retort, gave a.
white sublimate which had all the characters of sal-ammoniac.
   Treated by Boussingault’s method, the water of the Dead Sea.
gave appreciable quantities of ammonia. Carefully evaporated at
100° C., 100 grms. left a greyish-white residue weighing 23'576 grms.
This, when deprived of its water of crystallization by heating it to
dull redness for some time, and allowing for the hydrochloric acid
liberated by the decomposition of the chloride of magnesium, weighed
20'60 grms. The analysis showed that this residue was constituted

      DIRECT DETERMINATION OF OXYGEN IN ORGANIC BODIES.
    Messrs. Wanklyn and Frank have found that organic bodies, when
 they are heated to redness in excess of hydrogen, evolve some, if not
 the whole, of their oxygen in the form of water, and found upon this
 fact at least a qualitative, if not a quantitative method of determin
 ing oxygen.                                  '
 ON THE VOLUMETBIC RELATIONS OF OZONE. BY M. T. L. SORET1‘.
    Referring to his methodi of obtaining ozonized oxygen very rich
in ozone by means of electrolysis, the author described experiments
 made on ozonized oxygen prepared by that method. These experi
 ments related to the action of iodide of potassium, of several other
 chemical reagents, and of heat upon the gas; and their result was
 the same as that of Messrs. Andrews and Tait.
     Thus, having treated his ozonized oxygen with iodide of potassium,
 M. Soret con<U+FB01>rms the remarkable result of Messrs. Andrews and Tait,
 that ozonized oxygen undergoes no change of volume when it acts
 upon iodide of potassium, but liberates an amount of iodine which
is equivalent to a very appreciable volume of oxygen.
    With arsenite of soda 9. similar result was obtained,—-viz., con
 traction insensible ; volume of oxygen which entered into combina
 tion with the arsenite quite appreciable.

ciety of Natural History at Heidelberg, 17th July 1863.

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               555
    The action of heat upon ozonized oxygen was found to bring
 about a sensible permanent expansion (i. e. an expansion which was
permanent on cooling down to the original temperature). M. Soret
heated his gas by means of a spiral of platinum wire maintained at
a red heat by an electric current. Furthermore this expansion of
the ozonized oxygen was just equal to the volume of oxygen which
the same gas could give up to iodide of potassium.
    Caustic potash acts like heat, and not like iodide of potassium or
arsenite of soda : thus, it produces an expansion nearly equal to the
volume of oxygen which the gas could give to iodide of potassium if
it were treated with that reagent.
    The author suggests this explanation of the action of potash upon
ozonized oxygen : it <U+FB01>rst becomes peroxide of potassium by seizing
the oxygen given off by the decomposition of ozone, and then the_
peroxide of potassium itself decomposes, and so the expansion is pro
duced. The oxygen freshly given oif by peroxide of potassium is libe
rated in a solution; it would therefore dissolve more readily than the
rest of the oxygen, or rather would form, as it were, a supersaturated
solution; and so the very slight inequality between the observed ex
pansion of ozonized oxygen on treatment with potash, and the volume
of oxygen which the same sample of ozonized oxygen is capable of -
giving to iodide of potassium, is accounted for.
   The author remarks that his results, which agree with those of
Messrs. Andrews and Tait, are capable of explanation by the theory
which has been maintained by Weltzien and Von Babo, and which
consists in representing the molecule of ozone as consisting of several
molecules of oxygen.
   In producing oxidation, 1'. e. in acting upon iodide of potassium or
arsenite of soda, a volume of ozone gives up oxygen to the body
which undergoes oxidation, and liberates a volume of inactive oxygen
equal to the volume of the original ozone. Thus there is no altera
tion in the volume of the gas, and yet oxygen is absorbed by the re- '
ducing agent. In being acted upon by heat, the ozone is simply
decomposed into ordinary oxygen, and consequently the result is
an expansion which is equal to the volume of oxygen capable of .
being given up to reducing agents.
   M. Soret calls attention to the fact that, until a. determination of
the density of ozone shall have been made (for which either pure
ozone, would be required, or some reagent which could absorb both
the active and the inactive oxygen set at liberty on the decompo
sition of ozone), we cannot say how many molecules of oxygen go to
form one molecule of ozone ; and, after a notice of Messrs.Andrews
and Tait’s notion that oxygen itself is a compound, concludes with
the observation that the theory of M. Clausius, that ozone exists in
combination in ordinary oxygen, is tenable if the addition be made
that ozone at the moment of its liberation combines with ordinary
oxygen. This latter view would involvejust the same experimental
facts as the former one*, and, according to the author, would still be
in harmony with the reasoning employed by M. Clausius.
   * The theory would indeed involve the experimental facts above given,
but it would involve further experimental facts which the theory ascribed
to Weltzien and Von Babo would not involve.—-I. A. W.

naturally see reason to modify in some respects the ex

      VIEWS IN ETHNOGRAPHY, &0.
 IN the remarks which will be offered in the present paper, it is
not intended to enter upon the question, which has so often and
so ably been discussed by physiologists and natural historians,
as to whether the numerous and strongly marked diversities in
the human race have proceeded from distinct stocks, or whether
 they are derived from a common origin and are consequently to
be regarded as forming merely varieties of one and the same
species: it is su<U+FB01>icient to state, that, for the purposes of this
disquisition, the latter hypothesis is adopted, as being that which
 appears to be the more in accordance with reason, and to have on
its side the greater weight of authority.
    It is also scarcely necessary to do more than allude to the
opinion generally entertained by physiologists, historians, jurists,
political economists, and others, who have investigated and
treated of the subject of the primitive condition of man, and
the rise and progress of society, that in the <U+FB01>rst ages the human
race existed in the lowest state of civilization* ; namely, that of
the mere consumer of the spontaneous productions of nature;
and that mankind thence progressively advanced through the
several conditions of the hunter, the herdsman, and the agricul
turist, or through states nearly corresponding with them :—
until, in this last state, an absolute property having been ac
quired in the land, which was then <U+FB01>rst subjected to cultivation,
the residences of mankind became <U+FB01>xed and permanent; whilst,
by the same progressive advancement, societies were formed,
which at <U+FB01>rst were simply patriarchal, but which, from their
   * [“ It seems no longer possible to doubt that the human race has existed
on the earth in a barbarian state for a period far exceeding the limit of histo
rical record.”——Address of Sir William G. Armstrong, President of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, at the Meeting at Newcastle,
August 26th, 1863.]

                                 6
subsequent increase and union, required the institution of laws
for their government and mutual protection; whence ultimately
resulted the establishment of the various forms and conditions
of civil rule.
   This opinion of the gradual progress of civilization, whatever
ground it may have gained, is at the best purely hypothetical.
So far, indeed, is it from being borne out by facts, that it is
actually at variance with the evidence of all history and experi
ence : for, in the early historical remains, whether real or fabu
lous, of all nations,-—with the remarkable exception of those of
the progenitors of the Israelites,—we <U+FB01>nd that instruction and
improvement are considered to have been introduced, from an
extrinsic source, by individuals possessed of a higher degree of
culture ; whilst among those savage people with whom civiliza
tion may be said not to exist, there is not manifested even the
remotest tendency towards progressive improvement from the
exercise of that unaided reason, which, as the characteristic of
the human race, has been deemed to be entirely suf<U+FB01>cient for
that purpose.
   It is to be considered, then, whether the direct converse of
the hypothesis here adverted to ought not rather to be main
tained; and whether in fact it will not be more in accordance
with the truth to assert, that the savage and uncultivated con
dition of mankind, which has usually been designated the state
of nature, is in reality nothing else than a degeneration from a
previous social state, in which a high degree of culture and of
arti<U+FB01>cial attainments were possessed; and that consequently
this latter condition, and not the former, ought to be regarded
as the primitive condition of the present human race.
   However paradoxical such an hypothesis may at <U+FB01>rst sight
appear, there is in reality nothing unreasonable in it. If we
consider the history of the European settlements in the New
World and especially in North America, we <U+FB01>nd the fact to be,
that some of the members of a previous social state, which had
existed in a highly civilized condition during several ages,
arrived in that continent; where their descendants, and especially
those who spread themselves most widely over the newly settled
countries, speedily degenerated from the cultivation of the

                                  7
parent stock.    Could it so have happened that all further com
munication with the Old World had ceased, the deterioration
which had commenced would unquestionably have proceeded
still further: but this process has been checked by the conti
nual arrivals of fresh settlers from the mother country and the
constant communications between the two continents, which
have in a great measure maintained an equality between their
respective inhabitants. But let it be supposed that these
European settlers in America had been the only remains of a
former race of mankind: it is evident that, whatever in the
course of ages might be the character and condition of their
descendants,—even if some of them, in the extreme western pro
vinces of America or in other countries into which they might
have spread, had become so debased and brutalized as not to be
recognized as belonging to the same race ;—still, in the con
sideration of their history, and in the endeavour to trace to their
pristine state their laws, their customs, and their religion, how
ever altered, however perverted or corrupted they might become,
it would be utterly inconsistent that reference should (in the
<U+FB01>rst instance at least) be made to any other stock than the Euro
pean colonists from whom they had sprung, or to any other con
dition of society than that previous arti<U+FB01>cial one of which those
Europeans themselves had been members.
   May not, then, the history of the whole human race be con
sidered in a similar point of view to that in which the history of
the American colonists has thus hypothetically been regarded?
If we look to the histories, traditions, and fables of all nations,
we <U+FB01>nd that they all coincide in expressly recording or in al
luding to a cataclysm,—-the particulars of which are the most
fully and circumstantially detailed in the Sacred Writings of the
Israelitish nation,—which overwhelmed the whole of mankind,
with the exception of a few favoured individuals, who became
the founders of the subsequent human race: and it, therefore,
we only admit the fact of the occurrence of such an event, we
can at once understand how the condition of the <U+FB01>rst ancestors
of the present race of mankind was not a natural but an arti<U+FB01>cial
one, derived from the previous social state of the antediluvian
world.    Hence we can have no di<U+FB01>iculty in conceiving how the

                                 8
social condition of man may have fallen from the culture of that
arti<U+FB01>cial primitive state to the condition of the uncultivated
savage, through all those intermediate stages of civilization which,
according to the contrary hypothesis, have been regarded as the
steps by which man has progressed upwards.
   The process of this declension in civilization may be thus
briefly stated. VVhen mankind <U+FB01>rst began to separate and to
be scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, it is mani
fest that the amount of knowledge in every department of pursuit
must have diminished at every step that was taken from the
centre, unless each tribe could have ensured to itself (which
would have scarcely been possible) the possession of individuals
imbued with the aggregate of the acquirements of the parent
society. Knowledge can in no case remain perfectly stationary:
it must either advance or recede: and the latter must universally
have been the case in the <U+FB01>rst instance, and must have con
tinued to be so, until the numbers of mankind had sufficiently
increased to allow them again to begin to accumulate—each
nation in its own particular sphere of acquirements—the know
ledge which had been retained by direct transmission from the
common centre, or which had subsequently been derived from
the circumstances in which they had respectively been placed.
   Subsequently to the [original] dispersion of mankind, the
pressure of population would doubtless have been the ‘primary
cause of the general distribution of the human race over the
earth, and of their consequent descent in the scale of civiliza
tion. To this, however, are to be added disputes among neigh
bouring people, too often ending in warfare; the dislike of some
races to the countries in which they had voluntarily settled, or
into which they had been compelled to migrate; and the desire,
or probably the necessity, of obtaining possessions more suited
to their inclinations or their requirements. As the social tie
gradually became -weaker, the growth of erratic habits, and the
consequent rapidl declension ‘in civilization which universally
attends the settling of new lands, would operate; leading at
length to a con<U+FB01>rmed nomadic state. In any of these inter
 mediate stages of degradation, however, further deterioration
may have been prevented, and an impulse may indeed have been

                                  9
given to a progressive state of improvement, by any causes,
whether natural or arti<U+FB01>cial, which would prevent the further
disintegration of society, and bring its members into more inti
mate connexion, so as to preserve the means for the mutual im
partation of knowledge. Thus, in maritime countries, where the
further progress and dispersion of mankind has been stopped by
the ocean ;—in islands ;--in cities,where men have been congre
gated together for the purposes of commerce ;-and even in rich
alluvial countries, of which, by means of agricultural knowledge,
the products have afforded subsistence to a dense population ;—
civilization, so far from remaining stationary, has generally con
tinued to advance : Whilst in champaign, barren, and desert
countries, on the contrary, where nomadic habits have been in
duced, the people have descended in the scale of civilization in
an equal ratio to the quality of the country and its means of
affording subsistence, operating conjointly with its extent and
the consequent absence of the necessity for its inhabitants to
adopt any means of support, beyond those which have spon
taneously presented themselves and which have thence become
congenial to them; such as the pasturing of their <U+FB02>ocks in
countries su<U+FB02>iciently fertile for that purpose, and the hunting of
wild animals, where the physical condition of the country has
not been adapted to the support of tame ones.
   From this last state,—in which, owing to the loss of the know
ledge of accumulating capital, whether in the form of money or
of merchandize and ultimately even in that of cattle, a large tract
of country would become necessary for the support of a much
smaller number of persons; and in which also, from the disin
tegration of society, the traditive knowledge of each successive
generation would become less and less,—the progress to the
condition of the mere savage, or man in the lowest state of culti
vation, is easy to be traced. In cold and inhospitable countries,
however, where the uncivilized races inhabiting them would be
compelled to use every exertion in order to procure a scanty and
precarious subsistence, the lowest mechanical arts would still be
retained, until the inclemencies and privations to which those
races were subjected had caused their extinction (a result which
there is good reason to believe has in many instances taken

                                         10
place); whilst in more genial climates, where the spontaneous
productions of nature were su<U+FB02>icient for the support of mankind,
-the absence of motives for exertion would lead to the total de
clension of their debased inhabitants, so that at length they
 would become almost assimilated with the brute creation.
     The hypothesis which is thus advocated removes very many
of the dif<U+FB01>culties which, under the opposite one, have attended
the consideration of primeval history; and it more especially
accounts for the existence, in the earliest ages, of nations whose
 civilization and power, even allowing to them the utmost preco
city, were always incompatible with what was conceived to have
been at the same periods the state of society generally.
    A still more important result is, that we have afforded to us
a satisfactory means of explaining the existence of the various
diversities in the human species; which diversities, so far from
being referrible to any permanent distinctive characters, or even
to the action of climate and other physical causes alone, must
principally be derived from the operation of changes in the
moral and intellectual state of the various races. Indeed, it must
never be lost sight of, that man is a reasonable being and not a
mere animal; and that consequently it is absolutely necessary,
in all investigations of his natural history, to consider him not
physically only, but also psychologically.
    Upon the hypothesis, then, that the origin of the numerous
and widely di<U+FB01>ering races of man is to be referred to a single
parent stock possessed of a high degree of cultivation, the fol
lowing principle presents itself: namely, That (allowing for cir
cumstances by which the progress of deterioration may have
been accelerated or retarded or otherwise modi<U+FB01>ed) the culture
or the degradation of an aboriginal race* will be in proportion
to the geographical distance of its residence from the common
centre of dispersion. For example, if we take the primitive
residence of the post-diluvian race to have been in the north
western portion of Mesopotamia,——the reasons for which location
are given at length in the work1' of which this paper is designed
   ' By the term “aboriginal race” is simply meant the people who were
the earliest inhabitants of any country.

                                    1]
  to make known the principal conclusions with respect to philo
  logy, ethnography, and the natural history of man,—it will be
  seen that the countries more immediately surrounding that cen
  tral point,—namely, Assyria, Chaldea, Egypt, Phoenicia, and
  Asia Minor,-—are those whose inhabitants were in the earliest
  ages possessed of the highest degree of culture ; whilst, on the
  other hand, at the points most distant from the same centre, the
  Papuans, the Hottentots, the Esquimaux, and other savage races
  have degenerated almost to the lowest state compatible with the
  retention of rational endowments.
     A second principle resulting from the same hypothesis is, that
  (except where invasions have introduced foreign tribes, as in the
  case of the Hindoos in India) the more degenerate races, whose
  positions are considerably removed from the centre, must have
  derived their origin from that centre through the medium of
  the more civilized people geographically situate between it and
  them, and must consequently have received from them their
  languages, their religion, and their customs; although, in con
  sequence of the recession from the centre of these more degene
  rate races, and their gradual corruption and debasement, the
  changes in all those particulars, as well as in their physical
  structure and appearance, may have become such as to render
  it a task of the utmost difficulty to trace the resemblance and
  the connexion between them and their more civilized ancestors.
  Thus the primitive inhabitants of the whole of Southern and
  Eastern Asia must have sprung from ancestors who originally
  occupied the countries situate to the northward of the Persian
  Gulf: so the aborigines of Africa must be descended from the
  earliest settlers of Arabia, Ethiopia, and Egypt ; whilst the tribes
  who peopled the islands and continent of Europe, and who from
  thence also spread themselves eastward into the northern por
  tions of Asia, must have had their origin in Asia Minor. ‘
      It is also to be inferred, that where different races have, in
   their corresponding removal from the centre, undergone a cor
   responding degradation, at the same time that they have been
   subjected to the operation of similar physical conditions, the
' results will be analogous in those races, both with respect to
   their physical conformation and as regards their moral and in

                                12
tellectual character.    This is remarkably exempli<U+FB01>ed in the
 separate existence of the Hottentots of the south of Africa, and
 of the Papuans or Asiatic Negroes; which two races—in spite
even of the authority of Cuvier himself—cannot, without viola
ting the most obvious principles of science and of history, be
 referred to the same class, but must be regarded as “ deviations
from the type of the species by different routes, in parallel ex
treme states of degradation.”
    I will now attempt brie<U+FB02>y to trace the outline of a classi<U+FB01>ca
tion of the various races of mankind, in accordance with the
principles which have thus been enunciated. In doing so, I
shall avail myself of the aid a<U+FB01>"orded by the numerous additions
which during the last few years have been made to our philo
logical knowledge, arising principally and more especially from
the improvements which have taken place in the science of
philology itself. It may indeed be asserted that, in the present
condition of physiology and of the natural history of man, the
a<U+FB02>inities of languages, if they be not the sole guides which we
possess for enabling us to arrange the varieties of the human
species in an order at all approximating to the truth, must at
least be regarded as the only one upon which any real depend
ence is to be placed.
   With the assistance then of this guide, we may divide the
races of mankind into the following principal classes. The <U+FB01>rst
is that which is composed of the nations to whom belong the
various languages of cognate origin, distinguished by the com
mon designation of Indo-Germanic or Indo-European. These
consist of the Sanscrit, the Zend or ancient Persic, the Phrygian,
the Lydian, the Greek, the Latin and its derivations, the lan
guages of the great Germanic family, the Celtic, and the Sla
vonian.
   Of these, the various languages of Europe and Asia Minor
may be regarded as aboriginal; that is to say, as having been
spoken by the people who were the <U+FB01>rst inhabitants of those
portions of the globe. On the other hand, the Sanscrit is ad-'
mitted to be the language, not of the aborigines, but of a race of
conquerors, who entered the Indian peninsula from the north
west and extirpated or drove southward before them the native

                                  .13
  races.   In like manner must it be considered that the Zend
   (the intimate connexion of which language with the Sanscrit
  is well established) was not the primitive language of Persia,
  but was introduced into that country also by the same exotic
  race, whose original seat must be looked for in the mountainous
  country to the west of the Caspian.
     To this class of languages, and to the people among whom the
  various dialects of them are spoken,—which people are in the pre
  sent day spread not only over Europe and a considerable portion
  of Asia, but, by means of European settlements and conquests,
  over the vast continent of America also, and who have likewise
  taken root in what may be regarded as a fifth quarter of the
- globe, namely, Australia,—the designation of Japetic or Japh
  thitish may with the strictest propriety be applied.
     The next grand division of mankind is composed (in part) of
  the nations to whom belong the so-called Semitic or Aramean
  languages; namely, the Hebrew, the Arabic, the Chaldee, and
  the Syriac.      ‘
     The reason of this nomenclature is, that the Hebrew and the
  Arabic are the languages spoken by the people who are regarded
  as the descendants of Abraham ; whilst the Chaldee and Syriac
  are considered to have been vernacular in Mesopotamia and
  Syria among the descendants of Aram; both those patriarchs
  being of the posterity of Shem, the eldest son of Noah. Philo
  logists have already discovered, however, that a<U+FB02>inities exist
  between these so-called Semitic tongues and other languages,
  such as the Phoenician, the Coptic, the Geez, and the Amharic
  of Abyssinia, and the Berber of Northern Africa, to which the
  same designation cannot with any correctness of nomenclature
  be applied, and which are in reality entitled to the appellation
  of Hamitish alone.
     Since then the languages spoken by the descendants of Isaac
  and of Ishmael, the sons of Abraham,—namely, the Hebrew and
  the Arabic,—are thus found to be cognate with those which are
  so widely spread among the descendants of Ham, it would seem
  most reasonable to imagine that the former languages, instead
  of being the representatives of the Shemitish tongue which was
  spoken by Abraham either in Chaldea or Aram, are the Hami

                                 14
tish languages which were vernacular in the countries in which
that patriarch and his descendants took up their residence, and
were, in fact, acquired by them during their residence therein,
to the exclusion of their paternal tongue. This hypothesis has
been advocated at length in ‘Origines Biblicae.’ In the same
work it has also been attempted to be shown that the so-called
 Chaldee is merely a corruption of the Hebrew spoken by the
Jews during their captivity in Babylon, and not the native lan
guage which at that epoch was vernacular in Babylon itself.
In like manner is the Syriac to be regarded as only a further
degradation and corruption of the Hebrew. Under no circum
 stances, indeed, can it claim to be the primitive native tongue
of the countries in which it was spoken about the period of the
commencement of the Christian era: for, subjected as they had
been to repeated and continued foreign invasion and occupation,
it is impossible that any native language should during more
than twenty centuries have continued to exist without very con
siderable alterations, if indeed it must not have been altogether
 extirpated.
    The appellation of Semitic or Shemitish, as applied to these
languages, must therefore be superseded by that of Hamitish;
under which designation will have to be comprised not only the
 Canaanitish, Arabian, and African languages which have been
 enumerated, but also the whole of the native dialects spoken
throughout the continent of Africa ; all the inhabitants of which
 continent must, agreeably to the hypothesis advocated in this
 paper, have derived their origin from the centre, through the
 medium of the more civilized countries of Arabia and Egypt.
    The remaining class of mankind which will here be mentioned
 is that of which the Chinese, and the various Indo-Chinese na
 tions, may in the present day be regarded as the principal repre
 sentatives. In tracing back these people to their common
 origin with the rest of mankind, in accordance with the fore
 going hypothesis, it is manifest that their progenitors must in
the earliest ages have occupied the more western portions of
 Asia, and that they were, in fact, of like origin with the abori
 gines of the Peninsula of India, of whom traces are yet left in
 the Bheels and other savage races scattered over various por

                                          15
  tions of that peninsula, and in the people found in greater
  numbers towards its southern extremity; whose languages, of
  a totally distinct character from the Sanscrit and its derivative
  dialects, plainly point to the separate origin of those people
  from that of the Japhthitish Hindoos.
     It is to this division of mankind that I conceive the designa
  tion of Semitic or Shemitish ought properly to be applied; and
  within this division must also be comprised the whole of the
  aboriginal inhabitants of the Indian Archipelago, of Polynesia,
  and likewise of America; but upon the subject of these people
  I will refrain from enlarging, as the grounds upon which the
  classi<U+FB01>cation of the varieties of the human species has been
  attempted in this paper are intended to be essentially philolo
  gical, and that department of knowledge does not (as far as I
  am acquainted with it) afford su<U+FB02>icient data upon which the
  proposed classi<U+FB01>cation should be thus far extended.
     When, however, our philological knowledge shall become yet
  further enlarged, it will be seen whether or not all the languages
  of the earth, and the people speaking them, are referrible to the
  three distinct divisions which have thus been enumerated; and
  it will also be de<U+FB01>nitively ascertained whether these divisions of
   languages are, like the distinct races of mankind to whom they
   belong, reducible to one common source. ‘With respect to the
   former of these questions, there is good reason to believe that,
   sooner or later, it will be determined in the a<U+FB01>irmative; but
   with regard to the latter of them, the opinion of philologists is
   already very decidedly in the negative. If this be established,
   we shall be compelled to have recourse to an original forma
‘ tion of more than one primitive tongue; an hypothesis which
   in reality is attended with no greater difficulty than that of the
   original formation of a single language.
