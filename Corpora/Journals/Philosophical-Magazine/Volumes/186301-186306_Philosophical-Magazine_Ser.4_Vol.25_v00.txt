                I. On the Secular Cooling of the Earth.
  By Professor WILLIAM THOMSON, LL.D., F.R.S., F.R.S.E.*
                              [With a Plate]
1. FOR eighteen years it has pressed on my mind, that essen
           tial principles of thermo-dynamics have been overlooked
by those geologists who uncompromisingly oppose all paroxysmal
 hypotheses, and maintain not only that we have examples now
 before us, on the earth, of all the different actions by which its
 crust has been modi<U+FB01>ed in geological history, but that these
 actions have never, or have not on the whole, been more violent
in past time than they are at present.
    2. It is quite certain the solar system cannot have gone on,
even as at present, for a few hundred thousand or a few million
years without the irrevocable loss (by dissipation, not by annihi
lation) of a very considerable proportion of the entire energy
initially in store for sun heat, and for plutonic action. It is
quite certain that the whole store of energy in the solar system
has been greater in all past time than at present; but it is
conceivable that the rate at which it has been drawn upon and
dissipated, whether by solar radiation, or by volcanic action in
the earth or other dark bodies of the system, may have been
nearly equable, or may even have been less rapid, in certain
periods of the past. But it is far more probable that the secular
rate of dissipation has been in some direct proportion to the total
amount of energy in store, at any time after the commencement
of the present order of things, and has been therefore very slowly
diminishing from age to age.
   3. I have endeavoured to prove this for the sun’s heat, in an

article recently published in ‘ Macmillan’s Magazine’ *, where I
have shown that most probably the sun was sensibly hotter a
million years ago than he is now. Hence geological specula
tions assuming somewhat greater extremcs of heat, more violent
storms and <U+FB02>oods, more luxuriant vegetation, and hardier and
coarser-grained plants and animals in remote antiquity, are
more probable than those of the extreme quietist or “ Uniformi
tarian” school. A “middle path,” not generally safest in scien
ti<U+FB01>c speculation, seems to be so in this case. It is probable
that hypotheses of grand catastrophes destroying all life from
the earth, and ruining its whole surface at once, are greatly in
error; it is impossible that hypotheses assuming an equability
of sun and storms for 1,000,000 years can be wholly true.
    4. Fourier’s mathematical theory of the conduction of heat is
a beautiful working out of a particular case belonging to the
general doctrine of the “Dissipation of Energy”'|'. A charac
teristic of the practical solutions it presents is, that in each case
a distribution of temperature, becoming gradually equalized
through an unlimited future, is expressed as a function of the
time, which is in<U+FB01>nitely divergent for all times longer past than
a de<U+FB01>nite determinable epoch. The distribution of heat at such
an epoch is essentially initial, that is to say, it cannot result from
any previous condition of matter by natural processes. It is,
then, well called an “arbitrary initial distribution of heat,” in
Fourier’s great mathematical poem, because it could only be
realized by the action of a power able to modify the laws of dead
 matter, In an article published about nineteen years ago in the
 ‘ Cambridge Mathematical Journal’I, I gave the mathematical
 criterion for an essentially initial distribution ; and in an inau
 gural essay, “ De Motu Caloris per Terrae Corpus,” read before
 the Facult of the University of Glasgow in 1846, I suggested,
 as an application of these principles, that a perfectly complete
  geothermic survey would give us data for determining an initial
 epoch in the problem of terrestrial conduction. At the meeting
 of the British Association in Glasgow in 1855, I urged that
 special geothermic surveys should be made for the purpose of
 estimating absolute dates in geology; and I pointed out some
 cases, especially that of the salt-spring borings at Creuznach in
 Rhenish Prussia, in which eruptions of basaltic rock seem to
 leave traces of their igneous origin in residual heat§. I hope

 this suggestion may yet be taken up, and may prove to some
 extent useful; but the disturbing in<U+FB02>uences affecting under
 ground temperature, as Professor Phillips has well shown in a
 recent inaugural address to the Geological Society, are too great
 to allow us to expect any very precise or satisfactory results.
    5. The chief object of the present communication is to esti
 mate, from the known general increase of temperature in the
earth downwards, the date of the <U+FB01>rst establishment of that
 “consistentior status,” which, according to Leibuitz’s theory, is
the initial date of all geological history.
    6. In all parts of the world in which the earth’s crust has
been examined, at su<U+FB01>iciently great depths to escape large in<U+FB02>u
ence of the irregular and of the annual variations of the super
<U+FB01>cial temperature, a gradually increasing temperature has been
found in going deeper. The rate of augmentation (estimated at
only Tl-6th of a degree Fahr. in some localities, and as much as
135th of a degree in others, per- foot of descent) has not been
observed in a sut<U+FB01>cient number of places to establish any fair
average estimate for the upper crust of the whole earth. But
 xl<U+FB01>th is commonly accepted as a rough mean ; or, in other words,
it is assumed as a result of observation that there is, on the
 whole, about 1° F. of elevation of temperature per 50 British
feet of descent.
    7. The fact that the temperature increases with the depth
implies a continual loss of heat from the interior, by conduction
outwards through or into the upper crust. Hence, since the
upper crust does not become hotter from year to year, there
must be a secular loss of heat from the whole earth. It is pos
sible that no cooling may result from this loss of heat, but only
an exhaustion of potential energy, which in this case could
scarcely be other than chemical af<U+FB01>nity between substances
forming part of the earth’s mass. But it is certain that either
the earth is becoming on the whole cooler from age to age, or
the heat conducted out is generated in the interior by temporary
dynamical (that is, in this case, chemical) action. To suppose,
as Lyell, adopting the chemical hypothesis, has done*, that the
substances, combining together, may be again separated electro
lytically by thermo-electric currents, due to the heat generated
by their combination, and thus the chemical action and its heat
continued in an endless cycle, violates the principles of natural
philosophy in exactly the same manner, and to the same degree,
as to believe that a clock constructed with a self-winding move
ment may ful<U+FB01>l the expectations of its ingenious inventor by
going for ever.
    8. It must indeed be admitted that many geological writers

  of the “Uniformitarian” school, who in other respects have taken
  a profoundly philosophical view of their subject, have argued in
  a most fallacious manner against hypotheses of violent action in
  past ages. If they had contented themselves with showing that
  many existing appearances, although suggestive of extreme vio
  lence and sudden change, may have been brought about by long
  continued action, or by paroxysms not more intense than some
  of which we have experience within the periods of human history,
  their position might have been unassailable, and certainly could
  not have been assailed except by a detailed discussion of their
  facts.    It would be a very wonderful, but not an absolutely in
  credible result, that volcanic action has never been more violent
  on the whole than during the last two or three centuries; but
  it is as certain that there is now less volcanic energy in the
  whole earth than there was a thousand years ago, as it is that
  there is less gunpowder in a “ Monitor” after she has been seen
  to discharge shot and shell, whether at a nearly equable rate or
 not, for <U+FB01>ve hours without receiving fresh supplies, than there
 was at the beginning of the action. Yet this truth has been
 ignored or denied by many of the leading geologists of the pre
 sent day, because they believe that the facts within their province
 do not demonstrate greater violence in ancient changes of the
 earth’s surface, or do demonstrate a nearly equable action in all
 periods.                                 - '
     9. The chemical hypothesis to account for underground heat
 might be regarded as not improbable, if it was onlyin isolated loca
 lities that the temperature was found to increase with the depth ,
 and, indeed, it can scarcely be doubted that chemical action exer
 cises an appreciable in<U+FB02>uence (possibly negative, however) on the
 action of volcanoes ; but that there is slow uniform “combustion,”
 “ eremacausis,” or chemical combination of any kind going on at
 some great unknown depth under the surface everywhere, and
 creeping inwards gradually as the chemical a<U+FB01>inities in layer
 after layer are successively saturated, seems extremely improbable,
 although it cannot be pronounced to be absolutely impossible, or
contrary to all analogies in nature. The less hypothetical view,
however, that the earth is merely a warm chemically inert body
cooling, is clearly to be preferred in the present state of science.
     10. Poisson’s celebrated hypothesis, that the present under
ground heat is due to a passage, at some former period, of the
solar system throughout hotter stellar regions, cannot provide
the circumstances required for a palaeontology continuous through
that epoch of external heat. For from a mean of values of the
conductivity, in terms of the thermal capacity of unit volume, of
the earth’s crust in three different localities near Edinburgh,
which I have deduced from the observations on underground

      Prof. W. Thomson on the Secular Cooling of the Earth.     5
temperature instituted by Principal Forbes there, I <U+FB01>nd that, if
the supposed transit through a hotter region of space took place
between 1250 and 5000 years ago, the temperature of that sup
posed region must have been from 25° to 50° F. above the pre
sent mean temperature of the earth’s surface, to account for the
present general rate of underground increase of temperature,
taken as 1° F. in 50 feet downwards. Human history negatives
this supposition. Again, geologists and astronomers will, I
presume, admit that the earth cannot, 20,000 years ago, have
been in a region of space 100° F. warmer than its present sur
face. But if the transition from a hot region to a cold region,
supposed by Poisson, took place more than 20,000 years ago,
the excess of temperature must have been more than 100° F.,
and must therefore have destroyed animal and vegetable life.
Hence, the further back and the hotter we can suppose Poisson’s
hot region, the better for the geologists who require the longest
periods; but the best for their view is Leibnitz’s theory, which
simply supposes the earth to have been at one time an incan
descent liquid, without explaining how it got into that state. If
we suppose the temperature of melting rock to be about 10,000°
F. (an extremely high estimate), the consolidation may have
taken place 200,000,000 years ago. Or, if we suppose the tem
perature of melting rock to be 7000° F. (which is more nearly
what it is generally assumed to be), we may suppose the conso
lidation to have taken place 98,000,000 years ago.
    11. These estimates are founded on the Fourier solution de
monstrated below. The greatest variation we have to make on
them, to take into account the differences in the ratios of con
ductivities to peci<U+FB01>c heats of the three Edinburgh rocks, is to
reduce them to nearly half, or to increase them by rather more
than half. A reduction of the Greenwich underground observa
tions, recently communicated to me by Professor Everett of
Windsor, Nova Scotia, gives for the Greenwich rocks a quality
intermediate between those of the Edinburgh rocks. But we are
very ignorant as to the effects of high temperatures in altering
the conductivities and specific heats of rocks, and as to their _
latent heat of fusion. We must therefore allow very wide limits
in such an estimate as I have attempted to make; but I think
we may with much probability say that the consolidation cannot
have taken place less than 20,000,000 years ago, or we should
have more underground heat than we actually have; nor more
than 4-00,000,000 years ago, or we should not have so much as
the least observed underground increment of temperature. That
is to say, I conclude that Leibnitz’s epoch of “emergence” of
the “ consistentior status” was probably between those dates.
   12. The mathematical theory on which these estimates are

 founded is very simple, being in fact merely an application of one.
 of Fourier’s elementary solutions to the problem of <U+FB01>nding at any
 time the rate of variation of temperature from point to point, and
 the actual temperature at any point, in a solid extending to in<U+FB01>

 the temperature has had two different constant values on the
 two sides of a certain in<U+FB01>nite plane. The solution for the two
 required elements is as follows :—

  The admirable analysis by which Fourier arrived at solutions
 including this, forms a most interesting and important mathe
 matical study. It is to be found in his T/iéorie Analytique de la
 Clialeur (Paris, 1822).
     14. The accompanying Plate (Pl. 1.) represents, by two curves,
                                   do
 the preceding expressions for E and 1: respectively.
    15. The solution thus expressed and illustrated applies, for a
 certain time, without sensible error, to the case of a solid sphere 0
 primitively heated to a uniform temperature, and suddenly ex
 posed to any super<U+FB01>cial action, which for ever after keeps the
 surface at some other constant temperature. If, for instance,
 the case considered is that of a globe 8000 miles diameter of
 solid rock, the solution will apply with scarcely sensible error for
 more than 1000 millions of years. For if the roclcbe of a cer
 tain average quality as to conductivity and speci<U+FB01>c heat, the value
 of K, as I have shown in a previous communication to the Royal
 Society*, will be 4100, to unit of length of a British foot and
 unit of timea year; and the equation expressing the solution
becomes

and if we give I the value 1,000,000,000, or anything less, the
exponential factor becomes less than e-5'6 (which being equal to
about §.}.6, may be regarded as insensible) when .1: exceeds
3,000,000 feet or 568 miles. That is to say, during the <U+FB01>rst
1000 million years the variation of temperature does not become
sensible at depths exceeding 568 miles, and is therefore con<U+FB01>ned
to so thin a crust that the in<U+FB02>uence of curvature may be neglected.
    16. If, now, we suppose the time to be 100 million years from
the commencement of the variation, the equation becomes
                    ? = crime
                     .2‘
The diagram (Pl. I.) therefore shows the variation of temperature
which would now exist in the earth if, its whole mass being <U+FB01>rst
solid and at one temperature 100 million years ago, the tempe
rature of its surface had been everywhere suddenly lowered by

Vdegrees, and kept permanently at this lower temperature, the
scales used being as follows :—
    (1) For depth below the surface,-—scale along OX, 10 quarter
inches, or a, represents 400,000 feet.
    (2) For rate of increase of temperature per foot of depth,—
scale of ordinates parallel to OY, 10 half inches, or [1, represents
   1 of V per foot. _ If, for example, V=7000°, this scale will
354000
be such that 10 half inches, or b, represents —l— of a degree
                                                    50'6
per foot.
    (3) For excess of temperature,—scale of ordinates parallel to
 OY, 10 half inches, or b, represents 13;”, or 7900°, if V= 7000°.
                                      5
    Thus the rate of increase of temperature from the surface
‘downwards would be sensibly all of a degree per foot for the <U+FB01>rst
 100,000 feet or so. Below that depth the rate of increase per
 foot would begin to diminish sensibly.        At 400,000 feet it
 would have diminished to about ,—l—, of a degree per foot.       At
 800,000 feet it would have diminished to less than -150 of its
                                                1
 initial value,—that is to say, to less than 55-57) of a degree per
 foot; and so on, rapidly diminishing, as shown in the curve.
 Such is, on the whole, the most probable representation of the
 earth’s preent temperature at depths of from 100 feet, where
 the annual variations cease to be sensible, to 100 miles; below
 which the whole mass, or all except a nucleus cool from the
 beginning, is (whether liquid or solid) probably at, or very nearly
 at, the proper melting temperature for the pressure at each depth.
     17. The theory indicated above throws light on the question
 so often discussed——Can terrestrial heat have in<U+FB02>uenced climate
 through long geological periods? and allows us to answer it very
 decidedly in the negative. There would be an increment of
 temperature at the rate of 2° F. per foot downwards near the
  surface 10,000 years after the beginning of the cooling in the
  case we have supposed. The radiation from earth and atmo
  sphere into space (of which we have yet no satisfactory absolute
 measurement) would almost certainly be so rapid in the earth’s
  actual circumstances as not to allow a rate of increase of 2° F.
  per foot underground to augment sensibly the temperature of the
  surface; and hence I infer that the general climate cannot be
  sensibly affected by conducted heat at any time more than 10,000
  years after the commencement of super<U+FB01>cial solidi<U+FB01>cation. No
  doubt, however, in particular places there might be an elevation
  of temperature by thermal springs, or by eruptions of melted
 lava; and everywhere vegetation would for the <U+FB01>rst 3,000,000

  solidation, be in<U+FB02>uenced by the sensibly higher temperature met
   with by roots extending a foot or more below the surface.
      18. Whatever the amount of such effects is at any one time,
  it would go on diminishing according to the inverse proportion
  of the square roots of the times from the initial epoch. Thus,
  if at 10,000 years we have 2° per foot of increment below ground,

 It is therefore probable that for the last 96,000,000 years the
 rate of increase of temperature under ground has gradually dimi
 nished from about Tlgth to about 31—,,th of a degree Fahrenheit per
 foot, and that the thickness of the crust through which any
 stated degree of cooling has been experienced has gradually in
 creased in that period from ?},-th of what it is now to what it is.
 Is not this, on the whole, in harmony with geological evidence,
 rightly interpreted? Do not the vast masses of basalt, the
 general appearances of mountain-ranges, the violent distortions
 and fractures of strata, the great prevalence of metamorphic action
 (which must have taken place at depths of not many miles, if
 so much), all agree in demonstrating that the rate of increase of
 temperature downwards must have been much more rapid, and
 in rendering it probable that volcanic energy, earthquake shocks,
 and every kind of so-called plutonic action have been, on the
 whole, more abundantly and violently operative in geological
antiquity than in the present age?
     19. But it may be objected to this application of mathema
tical theory (1) that the earth was once all melted, or at least
melted all round its surface, and cannot possibly, or rather can
not with any probability, be supposed to have been ever a uni
formly heated solid 7000° warmer than our present surface
temperature, as assumed in the mathematical problem ; and (2)
no natural action could possibly produce at one instant, and
maintain for ever after, a seven thousand degrees’ lowering of
the surface temperature. Taking the second objection <U+FB01>rst, I
answer it by saying, what I think cannot be denied, that a large
mass of melted rock exposed freely to our air and sky will, after
it once becomes crusted over, present in a few hours, or a few
days, or at the most a few weeks, a surface so cool that it can
be walked over with impunity. Hence after 10,000 years, or,
indeed, I may say after a single year, its condition will be sen
sibly the same as if the actual lowering of temperature experi
enced by the surface had been produced in an instant and main

tained constant ever after. I answer the <U+FB01>rst objection by saying
that if experimenters will <U+FB01>nd the latent heat of fusion, and the
variations of conductivity and speci<U+FB01>c heat of the earth’s crust
up to its melting-point, it will be easy to modify the solution
given above, so as to make it applicable to the case of a liquid
globe gradually solidifying from without inwards, in consequence
of heat conducted through the solid crust to a cold external
medium. In the mean time we can see that this modi<U+FB01>cation
will not make any considerable change in the resulting tempe
rature of any point in the crust, unless the latent heat parted
with on solidi<U+FB01>cation proves, contrary to what we may expect
from analogy, to be considerable in comparison with the heat
that an equal mass of the solid yields in cooling from the tem
perature of solidi<U+FB01>cation to the super<U+FB01>cial temperature. But,
what is more to the purpose, it is to be remarked that the objec
tion, plausible as it appears, is altogether fallacious, and that the
problem solved above corresponds much more closely in all pro
bability with the actual history of the earth, than does the modi
<U+FB01>ed problem suggested by the objection. The earth, although
once all melted, or melted all roundits surface, did in all proba
bility really become a solid at its melting temperature all through,
or all through the outer layer, which had been melted; and not
until the solidi<U+FB01>cation was thus complete, or nearly so, did the
surface begin to cool. That this is the true view can scarcely
be doubted when the following arguments are considered.
   20. In the <U+FB01>rst place, we shall assume that at one time the
earth consisted of a solid nucleus, covered all round with a very
deep ocean of melted rocks, and left to cool by radiation into
space. This is the condition that would supervene, on a cold
body much smaller than the present earth meeting a great
number of cool bodies still smaller than itself, and is therefore
in accordance with what we may regard as a probable hypothesis
regarding the earth’s antecedents. It includes, as a particular
case, the commoner supposition, that the earth was once melted
throughout, a condition which might result from the'collision
of two nearly equal masses. But the evidence which has con
vinced most geologists that the earth had a <U+FB01>ery beginning, goes
but a very small depth below the surface, and a<U+FB01>'ords us abso
lutely no means of distinguishing between the actual phenomena,
and those which would have resulted from either an entire globe
of liquid rock, or a cool solid nucleus covered with liquid to any
depth exceeding 50 or 100 miles.        Hence, irrespectively of any
hypothesis as to antecedents from which the earth’s initial <U+FB01>ery
condition may have followed by natural causes, and simply
assuming, as rendered probable by geological evidence, that
there was at one time melted rock all over the surface, we need

    Prof. W. Thomson an the Secular Cooliny of the Earth.           11
not assume the depth of this lava ocean to have been more than
50 or 100 miles ; although we need not exclude the supposition
of any greater depth, or of an entire globe of liquid.
   21. In the process of refrigeration, the <U+FB02>uid must (as I have
remarked regarding the sun, in a recent article in ‘ Macmillan’s
Magazine’*, and regarding the earth’s atmosphere, in a com
munication to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Man
chester1') be brought by convection to ful<U+FB01>l a de<U+FB01>nite law of dis
tribution of temperature which I have called “convective equi
librium of temperature.” That is to say, the temperatures at
different parts in the interior must differ according to the dif
ferent pressures by the di<U+FB01>erence of temperatures which any
one portion of the liquid would present, if given at the tem-‘
perature and pressure of any part, and then subjected to varia
tion of pressure, but prevented from losing or gaining heat.
The reason for this is the extreme slowness of true thermal
conduction, and the consequently preponderating in<U+FB02>uence of
 great currents throughout a continuous <U+FB02>uid mass in determin
ing the distribution of temperature through the whole.
    22. The thermo-dynamic law connecting temperature and
pressure in a <U+FB02>uid mass, not allowed to lose or gain heat, inves
 tigated theoretically, and experimentally veri<U+FB01>ed in the cases of
 air and water by Dr. Joule and myself I, shows, therefore, that
 the temperature in the liquid will increase from the surface
 downwards, if, as is most probably the case, the liquid contracts
 in cooling. On the other hand, if the liquid, like water near its
 freezing-point, expanded in cooling, the temperature, according
 to the convective and thermo-dynamic laws just stated (§§ 21,
 22), would actually be lower at great depths than near the sur
 face, even although the liquid is cooling from the surface; but
 there would be a very thin super<U+FB01>cial layer of lighter and cooler
 liquid, losing heat by true conduction, until solidi<U+FB01>cation at the
 surface would commence.

investigated by my brother, Professor James Thomson*, and
veri<U+FB01>ed by myself experimentally for water1', the temperature of
solidi<U+FB01>cation will, at great depths, because of the great pressure,
be higher there than at the surface if the <U+FB02>uid contracts, or
lower than at the surface if it expands, in becoming solid.
   24. How the temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation, for any pressure,
may be related to the corresponding temperature of <U+FB02>uid con
vective equilibrium, it is impossible to say, without knowledge,
which we do not yet possess, regarding the expansion with heat,
and the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the <U+FB02>uid, and the change of volume, and
the latent heat developed in the transition from <U+FB02>uid to solid.
   25. For instance, supposing, as is most probably true, both
that the liquid contracts in cooling towards its freezing-point,
and that it contracts in freezing, we cannot tell, without de<U+FB01>nite
numerical data regarding those elements, whether the elevation
of the temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation, or of the actual temperature
of a portion of the <U+FB02>uid given just above its freezing-point, pro
duced by a given application of pressure, is the greater. If the
former is greater than the latter, solidi<U+FB01>cation would commence
at the bottom, or at the centre, if there is no solid nucleus to
begin with, and would proceed outwards; and there could be no
complete permanent incrustation all round the surface till the
whole globe is solid, with, possibly, the exception of irregular,
comparatively small spaces of liquid.
    26. lf, on the contrary, the elevation of temperature, produced
by an application of pressure to a given portion of the <U+FB02>uid, is
greater than the elevation of the freezing temperature produced
by the same amount of pressure, the super<U+FB01>cial layer of the <U+FB02>uid
would be the <U+FB01>rst to reach its freezing-point, and the <U+FB01>rst actu
ally to freeze.
    27. But if, according to the second supposition of §22, the
liquid expanded in cooling near its freezing-point, the solid
would probably likewise be of less speci<U+FB01>c gravity than the
liquid at its freezing-point. Hence the surface would crust over
permanently with a crust of solid, constantly increasing inwards
by the freezing of the interior <U+FB02>uid in consequence of heat con
ducted out through the crust. The condition most commonly
assumed by geologists would thus be produced.
   28. ‘But Bischof’s experiments, upon the validity of which,
so far as I am aware, no doubt has ever been thrown, show that
melted granite, slate, and trachyte, all contract by something
about 20 per cent. in freezing. We ought, indeed, to have

more experiments on this most important point, both to verify
Bischof’s results on rocks, and to learn how the case is with iron
and other unoxidized metals. In the mean time we must con
sider it as probable that the melted substance of the earth did
really contract by a very considerable amount in becoming
solid.
    29. Hence if, according to any relations whatever among the
complicated physical circumstances concerned, freezing did
really commence at the surface, either all round or in any part,
before the whole globe had become solid, the solidi<U+FB01>ed super<U+FB01>cial
layer must have broken up and sunk to the bottom, or to the
centre, before it could have attained a su<U+FB01>icient thickness to rest
stably on the lighter liquid below. It is quite clear, indeed,
that if at any time the earth were in the condition of a thin solid
shell of, let us suppose, 50 feet or 100 feet thick of granite,
enclosing a continuous melted mass of 20 per cent. less speci<U+FB01>c
gravity in its upper parts, where the pressure is small, this con
dition cannot have lasted _many minutes. The rigidity of a solid
shell of super<U+FB01>cial extent so vast in comparison with its thick
ness, must be as nothing, and the slightest disturbance would
cause some part to bend down, crack, and allow the liquid to
run out over the whole solid. The crust itself would in conse
 quence become shattered into fragments, which must all sink to
 the bottom, or to meet in the centre and form a nucleus there if
there is none to begin with.
    30. It is, however, scarcely possible that any such continuous
 crust can ever have formed all over the melted surface at one
 time, and afterwards have fallen in.     The mode of solidi<U+FB01>cation
 conjectured in §25, seems on the whole the most consistent
 with what we know of the physical properties of the matter
 concerned.     So far as regards the result, it agrees, I believe,
 with the view adopted as the most probable by Mr. Hopkins *.
 But whether from the condition being rather that described in
 § 26, which seems also possible, for the whole or for some parts
 of the heterogeneous substance of the earth, or from the vis
 cidity as of mortar, which necessarily supervenes in a melted
 <U+FB02>uid, composed of ingredients becoming, as the whole cools,
 separated by crystallizing at different temperatures before the
 solidi<U+FB01>cation is perfect, and which we actually see in lava from
 modern volcanoes ; it is probable that when the whole globe, or
 some very thick super<U+FB01>cial layer of it, still liquid or viscid, has
 cooled down to near its temperature of perfect solidi<U+FB01>cation,
 incrustation at the surface must commence.
    31. It is probable that crust may thus form over wide extents

 ciation Report for 1847.

 of surface, and may be temporarily buoyed up by the vesicular
 character it may have retained from the ebullition of the liquid
 in some places; or, at all events, it may be held up by the vis
 cidity of the liquid, until it has acquired some considerable
 thickness sufficient to allow gravity to manifest its claim, and
 sink the heavier solid below the lighter liquid. This process
 must go on until the sunk portions of crust build up from the
 bottom a su<U+FB01>iciently close-ribbed solid skeleton or frame, to
-allow fresh inci-ustations to remain bridging across the now
 small areas of lava pools or lakes.
     32. In the honey-combed solid and liquid mass thus formed,
 there must be a continual tendency for the liquid, in consequence
 of its less speci<U+FB01>c gravity, to work its Way up ; whether by
 masses of solid falling from the roofs of vesicles or tunnels, and
 causing earthquake shocks, or by the roof breaking quite through
 when very thin, so as to cause two such hollows to unite, or the
 liquid of any of them to <U+FB02>ow out freely over the outer surface
 of the earth; or by gradual subsidence of the solid, owing to the
 thermo-dynamic melting which portions of it, under intense
 stress, must experience, according to views recently published
 by my brother, Professor James Thomson*. The results which
 must follow from this tendency seem sufficiently great and various
to account for all that we see at present, and all that we learn
from geological investigation, of earthquakes, of upheavals and
 subsidences of solid, and of eruptions of melted rock.
     33. These conclusions, drawn solely from a consideration of
 the necessary order of cooling and consolidation, according to
 Bischof’s result as to the relative speci<U+FB01>c gravities of solid and
 of melted rock, are in perfect accordance with what I have
 recently demonstrated-f regarding the present condition of the
 earth’s interior,--that it is not, as commonly supposed, all
 liquid within a thin solid crust of from 30 to 100 miles thick,
but that it is on the whole more rigid certainly than a continuous
 solid globe of glass of the same diameter, and probably than one
of steel.

pared are of different colours, or if a determination is to be made
of the brightness of light diffused in a given space, or if the
quantity of light is to be measured which a very small, or only
feebly transparent body transmits. In the latter case, the very
convenient method given by Bunsen for bright <U+FB02>ames cannot be
applied: this method consists in illuminating by the lights a
grease-spot on a sheet of paper both in front and behind so that
it disappears. Babinet’s method of neutralizing the colours of
polarization of two masses of light polarized at right angles to
each other also excludes the use of different-coloured lights, as
is directly evident from the bright colori<U+FB01>c phenomena which are
produced in my dichrooscope*. The transformation of a posi
tive Daguerreotype into a negative, when the re<U+FB02>ected light pre
ponderates over the diffused light which reaches the eye from
the same, which Pouillet has proposed, requires a room with
black walls. It has consequently only a limited application;
 moreover, its delicacy is not considerable if the objects to be
 compared present small surfaces, inasmuch as all the masses of
 light which fall diffused on the plate from all sources concur in
 producing the phenomena on the Daguerreotype plate. The
juxtaposition of equally dark shadows of a rod, as devised
 by Rumford, or of bright lines of light of a rotating luminous
 knob, as in Wheatstone’s method, excludes at once differently
 coloured sources of light, whose equal brilliancy the eye cannot
 judge. The enfeeblement of light caused by crossed Nicols, glass
 plates, or polarizing mirrors becomes an uncertain criterion in
 feeble sources of light, if the measurement consists in judging
 the actual disappearance, and not in the passage of one pheno
 menon into the opposite, which is essential in de<U+FB01>nite determi
 nations. The method I use has these advantages over those enu
 merated :—that it is very delicate; that it can be applied to objects
 of any size in the same manner, whether they are brightly or
 feebly luminous, of the same or different colours, and whether
 transparent oropake ; that, more0ve1',it is <U+FB01>tted fordetermining the
 intensity of light of optical instruments, that it allows of several
 different methods of measurement which mutually control each
 other, and, lastly,_ that it is obtained by means of an instrument
 which is in the hands of every working man of science.
    There are certain microscopic objects, for instance the skin of
  an ephemera, which appear dark upon a bright ground when
  illuminated from below, but bright upon a dark ground when
  the illuminating mirror is covered. This is seen in a far more
  beautiful manner in microscopic photographs, for instance in
  Major Dickson’s tablet in Rostherne Church, when it is looked
  at in one of Schieck’s microscopes with a power magnifying
                     * Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xx. p. 352.

  <U+FB01>fty times. The illumination from below gives a deep black im
  pression on a white ground ; and if the mirror is covered, illumi
  nation from above gives a white impression upon a dark ground.
'From this it would appear probable that the printing would dis
  appear if the light incident from above and from below had the
  same intensity, or if there were a de<U+FB01>nite relation between them,
  inasmuch as the angle under which they are incident may be
  different. If in the objective tube a polarizing Nicol be <U+FB01>tted,
 and if the ordinary ocular be replaced by that which contains an
  analysing Nicol, the inscription disappears on turning the ana
 lysing arrangement. The smallest further rotation transforms
 the previously dark inscription into a white one,—a proof of the
 great delicacy of the method. This is further seen in the fact,
 that if, at the position at which the inscription disappears, a
 feebly dim glass be interposed, the white inscription immediately
 appears on a dark ground if it be interposed in the light incident
 from below, while the bright inscription appears on a dark grolmd
 if the glass is interposed in the light incident from above.
     If the light incident from below be twice successively dim
 med, so that, from the disappearance of the inscription, it coun
 terbalances the light which is incident from above with unaltered
 brightness, it is at once clear that the quantities of light must in
 both cases be the same, inasmuch as the rays fall on the micro
 scopic object under exactly the same conditions. If now the
 methods which, with sources of light of di<U+FB01>erent brightness,
 require the deadening of the stronger so that both shall be
 equal, contain also in themselves a determination of the
 degree of this deadening, a quantitative determination of their
 different intensity under the same conditions follows directly
 therefrom.
    In modern microscopes there is the arrangement that the illu
minating mirror can be placed aside by a double angular motion ;
further, that the instrument itself can be removed from the ver
tical into any other position, which, as it only deviates consider
ably from the horizontal in certain special cases, I shall designate
the horizontal, in opposition to the vertical position, in which the
use of the mirror is presupposed.
    The modes of deadening are as follows :—
    l. Diminution of the aperture of the objective tube.
    2. Removal of the source of light from the same.
    3. Increase of the acting surface of the source of light by
inclining it towards the aperture, which represents the rectan
gular projection of that surface; in which case the cylindrical
aperture can be so arranged, by adding a tube blackened on the
inside, that only parallel rays fall on the photographic picture.
    4. Rotation of an ocular provided with an analysing Nicol,

              Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Photometer.               17
  after the analysing Nicol has been placed in the aperture of the
  objective tube.
     To diminish the aperture, a metallic lineal can be used in
  which circular apertures of gradually diminishing size are ar
  ranged in a straight line, of which the largest has the same
 diameter as the aperture. I shall call this lineal the slider.
 In the lineal which I used there were fourteen such apertures.
 Their diameter can be determined by the micrometric arrange
 ment of the microscope. Instead of the slider an eccentric
 disc can be used with diminishing apertures, as is often found on
 the older microscopes; yet a rectilinear slider is preferable,
 because the excentric disc, if it is to contain many apertures,
 becomes of an inconvenient size. The distance of the source of
 light is determined on a scale. The zero-point of the scale is, in
 a horizontal position, the photographic picture, which is fastened
 on the objective stand by the ordinary objective holder.
    In order to determine the size of the acting surface, any
 angle-measurers may be used. If the body to be tested is a
 plane surface di<U+FB01>'using light, it can be placed in the centre of a
 horizontal circle by whose limb it can be moved; or a plane
 mirror is placed on the surface, in which a distant scale is read
 0<U+FB01>' by means of a telescope. If the intensity of the light inci
 dent on a plane mirror under different angles is to be determined,
 the same method can be used to determine its angle. If, on
 the contrary, the re<U+FB02>ecting plane is the free surface of a liquid,
the incidence is obtained by inclining the axis of the microscope,
which is measured by means of a mirror <U+FB01>xed to it. In a similar
manner the rotation of the analysing Nicol is obtained by means
of an affixed mirror.                   »
    Feeble sources of light can be intensi<U+FB01>ed, if in a vertical posi
tion, by changing the plane illuminating-mirror for a concave
mirror, and in a horizontal position by an illuminating lens
which is so <U+FB01>xed that the concentration on the photographic
image takes place in the same manner as previously by the con
cave mirror. Where parallelism of the incident rays is required,
the source of light is in the focus of the lens.
    For di<U+FB02>erent sources of light the process is different. I shall
discuss it singly for the di<U+FB01>erent kinds.

    Coloured Glasses.—Wh€n the microscope is in a vertical posi
tion, the object is illuminated from below by the mirror directed
towards a portion of the heavens, and from above by the ordinary
light of day. The thickness of the glasses which close the aper
ture of the objective is now changed until compensation is

attained. If the quantity of light incident from below is thereby
more than compensated, the inscription does not appear white,
but of a bright subjective colour; but the transition from dark on
light ground, to light on dark ground, is readily perceived. With
glass coloured only super<U+FB01>cially (Ueberfanggliiser), an increase of
the thickness can only be obtained by superposing them; with
coloured glasses, by means of <U+FB02>at-cut wedges which are pushed
over one another; with coloured mica, by splitting it, and deter
mining the thickness by means of the spherometer. If the com
pensation has been obtained for different-coloured glasses in suc
 cession, this serves as a scale of colours of the same brightness.
    To answer the question in what relation the brightness de
 creases with increasing thickness, compensation is <U+FB01>rst effected
 for the greater thickness, and the magnitude of the aperture
 diminished by means of the slider until compensation is effected
 for the less thickness. With parallel incident light, the bright
 ness is inversely as the aperture. If the polarizing Nicol is
 placed in the aperture, the same result can be obtained by turn
 ing the analyser; for this only affects the polarized light incident
 from below, and not the diffused and therefore unpolarized light
incident from above.
    In the same way the relation of the transmitted light with
 the same thickness of different-coloured substances is obtained
 by means of the slider or of the Nicol.
    I was much surprised in these experiments at <U+FB01>nding how
 little the eye can judge the intensity of the light which a trans
 lucent body transmits in comparison with a transparent one. I
 constructed a set of glasses out of a cut ground glass, and in
 creased their number until the light which they transmitted was
 equal to that which traversed a red super<U+FB01>cially-coloured glass
 with re<U+FB02>ecting surfaces. Both held at the same distance from
 the eye, or held close before it, appear very different, that is,
 the red glass much brighter. Unconsciously we connect the
 idea of distinctness with the estimation of brightness, so that
 the latter is subordinate to the former.
    The testing of dichroitic crystals is effected by obtaining
 compensation in different directions. In some which I examined
 the difference was considerable. The testing of coloured glasses
 for solar observations, which darken greatly, is effected, after the
 mirror has been turned aside, by directing the instrument
 towards the sun immediately after the glasses have been inter
 posed. The determination of a still greater darkening, by
 combining di<U+FB01>ferent-coloured glasses, is effected in the same
 manner.
    The absorption of very transparent substances, as coloured
 liquids, which must be used in long tubes provided with move

             Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Pbotometer.                 19
  able glass plates, is also effected when the instrument is in a
  horizontal position. The microscope is employed in the same
  position when the liquid is one which transmits very little light,
  as, for example, indigo solution. For this purpose I have used
  the capillary apparatus, in which the liquid ascends between two
  slightly inclined glass plates. The distance from the edge gives
 the increasing thickness of the layer of liquid for a given distance
 of the plates. In the case of coloured gases which are enclosed
 invessels, the instrument also stands horizontal. The turbidity
 by smoke may be investigated in the open air.
     With cloths, paper, &c., the increasing thickness is obtained
 by folding them together. The quantity of light transmitted
 in this case is not that directly observed, but partly that trans
 mitted by the interstitial spaces. The same is the case with
 thin coatings of gold or silver.
         Measurement of the Light dtfused by Opalce Bodies.
    If, in ordinary daylight, a sheet of white paper is held hori
 zontally under the objective tube of a microscope placed horizon
 tally, the illumination from above can be so regulated that the
 dark inscription is seen upon a white ground. By increasing
 the inclination, the white ground appears continually brighter
 in reference to the dark inscription. If the white sheet is
 exchanged for a dull black one, or for a uniformly blackened
 surface, under all inclinations the white inscription appears on a
 dark ground. With a coloured surface it is different.          If in
 this case the bright inscription appears upon a dark ground, at
 B certain inclination it disappears, and, on increasing the incli
nation, changes into a dark inscription upon a bright ground.
This gives a very simple means of judging which of two adjacent
colours is the brightest. The surface is inclined until the
inscription disappears, and the other colour is then brought
into the same position. It is brighter or darker according as
the inscription appears black or white. In an accurate deter
mination of the angle at which the transition takes place, all
lateral light must be excluded. To effect this, I have placed the
horizontally arranged microscope in such a manner that a tube
a foot long, blackened on the inside (part of a gun-barrel), was
in the continuation of the optical axis of the microscope, by
placing this tube directly against the inferior aperture of the
objective tube. The coloured discs, placed in a vertical position
and working on a vertical axis, were placed at the other end of
the tube.
    The moment at which a colourless transparent body, such as
water, becomes opake in consequence of total re<U+FB01>exion, is
distinctly seen by looking obliguely into a glass at the under
                                     2

side of the free surface—-and in a still more surprising manner
in the dazzling light which directly emerges from the perfectly
dark cylindrical jet of water which is strongly illuminated from
within, at the moment at which it separates in drops or is
interrupted by a shock, while a light held in the dark space
immediately behind passes through unchanged. Since with
the frequency of interruption the probability for the limiting
angle of total re<U+FB02>exion increases, we see directly how that which
is seen in a bubble in water, multiplying itself, produces
white foam—just as a crack in ice forms the transition to white
snow, a crack in glass explains the white powder of a broken
glass drop. But this powder is only white if the drop was of
colourless glass; it is greenish if it were of green glass, just as
the froth of champagne is clearer than that of beer, of coffee, or
of chocolate, all, however, exceeded in whiteness by soap-bubble.
The depolarization of polarized light incident on a snow surface
proves that the totally re<U+FB02>ecting surfaces are inclined in all
directions; and hence we can form an idea of the process of the
irregular re<U+FB01>exion of light from a white, grey, or coloured sur-'
face—in the latter cases if, to the conditions producing the
<U+FB01>rst phenomena, we add that of absorption in the passage
through coloured substances.
    On this view the rough surface of an unpolished body will
not re<U+FB02>ect light irregularly because it represents mirrors inclined
in all direction; for on this supposition the colour of the body
 would not be perceptible; on the contrary, it would present
 surfaces to the light which facilitate the penetration at an almost
 vertical incidence. Hence it is that increasing polish gradually
 conceals the colour of a body. The fact that a very dark colour
 ing substance appears brighter in a state of powder than one in
 a lump which had already a rough surface, does not disaccord
 with this; for here, by the greatly increased inequalities, the
 re<U+FB01>exion at a very acute inclination is increased, whereas the
 multifold rectangular incidences are little inclined to deepen the
 colour in consequence of the great opacity.
     It follows from the preceding considerations, that diffused
 light can be considered as if each point was self-luminous ; in
 this case if 0 is the aperture of the objective tube, and .z' the
 angle which the diffusing surface makes with the axis of the
microscope, the surface which sends light upon the photographic
picture will be it, and the brightness will be proportional to
 this. If for two di<U+FB02>erent substances with the same general
 illumination compensation takes place at the angles ac, and

  unifoimly in all directions, the determination of the brightness
 of a body which causes this is reduced to the simple measure
 ment of an angle. The strict validity, or its limitation, may,
 however, be ascertained empirically on comparing the values
 obtained by diminishing the aperture by means of the slider,
 the inclination remaining the same, with the values obtained by
 altering the inclination while the aperture remains the same.
 When an investigation is not made in this manner, the use of
 the slider is the most reliable.
     If the brightness resulting from the combination of the light
 emitted by two differently coloured surfaces is to be determined,
 it is best obtained by means of Fechner’s discs: in these, in
 concentric rings, the magnitude of the sector belonging to one
 colour gradually increases from 0° to 360°, while that of the
 other decreases simultaneously from 360° to 0°. The other
 rings being deadened off, the horizontal microscope is succes
 sively directed towards the individual concentric rings, and the
 brightness compensated.                        ~
    In rotating a Newton’s coloured disc, of course the brightness
 of a white one is not obtained, but only that corresponding to
 the absorption of all individual colours. It is only necessary to
 direct the photometer upon the rotating disk, and then ascertain
the angle which gives compensation, and subsequently to repeat
the same experiment with the white back of the disk, to see that
in the <U+FB01>rst case much light was absorbed. To determine the
quantity, as dark sector is gradually enlarged upon a white disc
until the brightness of both discs is the same.
    This gives rise to a physiological question, the answer to which
is not without interest. If a disc is divided into <U+FB01>ve white and
<U+FB01>ve dark sectors, the quantity of light which it sends to the
eye, while rotating with a de<U+FB01>nite velocity, is the same as if the
disc were divided into twenty-<U+FB01>ve dark sectors alternating with
twenty-<U+FB01>ve white ones; but the intervals in the <U+FB01>rst case last
<U+FB01>ve times as long as in the second. Has this an in<U+FB02>uence on
the determination of the brightness? It has always appeared to
me as if the brightness increased until the velocity of rotation
exceeded a certain limit. Possibly the limit of the interval at
which no increase takes place is different with different individuals.
    Streaked surfaces re<U+FB02>ect more light in the direction of the
stripes than in one at right angles to it, because in the latter
case there is a partial overshadowing. This is distinctly observed
 by producing a grating by passing chalk several times over a <U+FB01>le.
 In these respects the most remarkable differences are obtained '
 on certain plates of mother-of-pearl.

22             Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Pkotometer.
    With a very uniform dead polish the in<U+FB02>uence of the material
prevails. In this respect a brass disc gave somewhat greater
brightness than a copper disc.
    In this case the vertical direction of the instrument is prefer
able, because in rotating while in a horizontal position, the illu
mination of the other side of the photographic picture changes.
If the surfaces diffusing light surround a given space, for
instance the walls of a room, it is merely necessary, the micro
scope standing upright, to direct the concave mirror to different
parts of the room, to show surprising differences by sudden
transposition of dark into light.
                  Examination of Luminous Bodies.
    In the preceding investigations, the chief point was, how much
of the brightness of a given illumination is lost when it is subject
to absorption. The want of a unit of light is here less felt than
in the case of self-luminous bodies. As nature has not given us
 this unit, an approximation has been sought in normal candles,
 the light from which, if the length of the <U+FB02>ame is kept the same,
 is tolerably constant. Other methods are by means of Argand
 lamps, or gas-<U+FB02>ames from given apertures under constant pres
 sure, or, <U+FB01>nally, by means of a platinum wire which closes a circuit
 of given intensity. Uncertainty affects all photometric methods
 to the same extent, if it is required to reduce a given intensity of
 light to an absolute unit.
    At <U+FB01>rst it would appear simplest to place the horizontal
 microscope in such a position that its visual axis shall cut the
 line joining the two <U+FB02>ames whose intensities are to be compared,
 in that point at which the photographic image appears. But it
 is much more convenient to direct the microscope successively
 upon the two <U+FB02>ames, and to alter their distance so that the con
 stant light which from a de<U+FB01>nite distance illuminates the object
 makes the writing disappear. If both lights are in the prolongation
 of the visual axis of the microscope, the action of both lights is
 obtained directly after one _another, if behind the <U+FB01>rst a screen
 is placed which conceals the second, and then the <U+FB01>rst and the
 screen are simultaneously removed: this can be effected so
 rapidly that the <U+FB02>ames, which are considered to be constant,
 may be assumed to be really so. In <U+FB02>ames not so bright, a
  twentyfold magnifying power may be used. In the case of
  a gas-<U+FB02>ame at a distance of some hundred feet, the passage
 of black print on dark ground to light upon dark ground
 is very distinctly seen if a spirit-lamp containing alcohol satu
 rated with salt is held in front. The feebleness of the light
 of ome <U+FB02>ames as compared with others is surprising. If the
 instrument is directed upon a stearine candle at a distance of

              Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Pkotometer.               23
  some feet, such a spirit-<U+FB02>ame may be placed between the objec
  tive of the microscope and the photographic image, and yet the
  dark print upon white ground is seen on looking through the
  <U+FB02>ame. At a greater distance it disappears, inasmuch as the
  print is completely covered by the <U+FB02>ame in front.
     The brightness of the moon in different phases may be deter
 mined in the same manner. The microscope is directed upon
 it, and the picture is illuminated from the front by a candle.
     The ignition of a platinum wire closing a galvanic circuit, the
 intensity of which varies, may be determined in the same
 manner.
     Some years ago I had occasion to see experiments upon the
 artillery-practice ground here, in which the electric light of a
 powerful battery was compared, by means of a large concave
 mirror, with that produced by rockets sent up for the purpose
 of ascertaining the progress of besiegers. The comparison was
 effected by directly looking at the place where the men were
 drawn up. It would have been obtained with greater certainty
 if the illumination of a white surface had been ascertained by
 means of the photometer.
    The spark passing from the condenser of one electrical machine
 to another gives a very distinct picture, which may be com
 pensated.
    Even by the discharge of a Leyden jar the writing is visible.
    The stratified light of a very beautiful Geissler’s tube was
 investigated in the same way. To the pear-shaped middle, two
narrow tubes were <U+FB01>xed which terminated in bulbs with wires
fused in. The blue light which surrounded the wire with its
narrow envelope of light was somewhat brighter than the red
strati<U+FB01>ed light of the nearest tubes, and almost of the same
brightness as that on the second leg, but much brighter than
that of the other pole in the bulb nearest this pole.
    The whitish strati<U+FB01>ed light illuminated the print so as to make
it distinctly perceptible, both when the tube was connected with
the Ruhmkor<U+FB02>"s apparatus, and when it was held on the con
ductor of an ordinary electrical machine.
    One of the legs of a U-shaped Geissler’s tube was surrounded
with sulphate of quinine <U+FB02>uorescing under its in<U+FB02>uence. This
leg shone more strongly than that which was not so surrounded,
aproof that the apparatus is sufficiently delicate for <U+FB02>uorescence.
    Phosphorescent light, on the contrary, did not come up to
my expectations. Only in one case out of seven did I succeed,
with a tube which shows very brightly after insolation, in recog
nizing the writing. This, it is true, was in an inadequately
darkened room.

-' 24           - Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Photomeler.
              Intensity of the Light of Optical Instruments.
      The examination of telescopes is very simple. Where, when
 'the telescope is directed upon an in<U+FB01>nitely distant object, the
   rays emerge parallel from the eyepiece, the intensity of the light
 -of the telescope is determined by the brightness of a section of
   this emergent cylinder of light. The microscope is so placed
   that, while the aperture of the objective tube covers the aperture
   of the eyepiece, the axis of the microscope is the rectilinear pro
   longation of the axis of the telescope directed towards the heavens.
   For di<U+FB01>erent instruments which are to be compared with one
 ‘another, this may be rapidly effected either with a clear or with
   a uniformly clouded sky. The determination is made by ap
   proaching a constant light to the front side of a photographic
   picture.
      It is not advantageous to use direct sunlight for this illumi
   nation of the front side; for with such strong illumination the
   writing appears like gold print, which renders the determination
   more di<U+FB01>icult.
      The determination of microscopes takes place in the same
   manner.
      That of the re<U+FB02>exion of mirrors is effected by the method spoken
   of when consideringthe diffusion of rough surfaces. It has surprised
   me that a carefully polished silver mirror, at any rate under acute
   incidences, re<U+FB02>ects more light upon the glass side than upon the
   metallic ; in other words, that the addition of the re<U+FB02>exion from
   the outer surface of the glass more than compensates the loss
   which the metallic surface coating the glass experiences by the
   glass. The in<U+FB02>uence of this external re<U+FB02>exion is determined if
   the mirror, while at the polarizing angle of glass, is viewed
   through an eyepiece provided with a polarizing Nicol, so that the
   re<U+FB02>ected light is polarized. The decrease of the intensity in con
   sequence of multifold re<U+FB02>exion is easiest obtained by mirrors
   which can be brought near by means of a screw, where the
   re<U+FB02>ecting side of the one overlaps that of the other laterally.
   The total re<U+FB02>exion of a rectangular prism is most easily obtained
   by bringing it under" the aperture of the object-tube of the
   microscope standing almost vertical. The microscope, on the
   contrary, is almost horizontal in investigating a re<U+FB02>ecting prism,
   or the combination of two, which I have named reversion prism.
   As this serves to change linearly-polarized into elliptically-polar
   ized light, without, as in Fresnel’s rhombohedron, coming out
   of the axis of the instrument, the intensity of its light can be
   compared with that of such a one. The method appears to me
   important for hollow mirrors and condensing-lenses, from its
   application to lighthouses with polyzonal lenses. In my resi

             Prof. H. W. Dove on a New P/mtometer.              25
dence I could only extend to a distance of 160 feet the experi
 ments to ascertain if, by parallelism of the rays, the action of
 distance were eliminated or not ; but the great intensity of light
 convinced me that the test was applicable to very considerable
 distances. Experiments at a constant distance of a stationary
 light might give information as to the limits of the in<U+FB02>uence of
 incipient obscurations in the atmosphere. Here the instrument
 acts as a diaphanometer. I also think that in solar eclipses it
furnishes a much more accurate mode of determining the illu
mination than previous methods.             ‘
    The intensity of the light of different parts of the spectrum
may be obtained in two ways,—by allowing the individual rays
to fall directly on the microscope arranged horizontally, or by
directing the microscope upon a white wall on which the spec
trum is received. A comparison of both shows the in<U+FB02>uences of
diffusion caused by rough surfaces, and dependent on the length
of wave. In this case I think it convenient to use, for illumina
ting the front side of the photograph by re<U+FB02>exion, the solar light
itself, incident through another aperture in order to eliminate
thereby the varying intensity at different times according to the
transparency of the air.
    I have investigated polarized colours as follows :-—Between
two Nicols, selenite plates of i to if thickness were interposed,
and the photographic picture was laid on the aperture of the upper
one. In the polarizing apparatus which I have described, this
takes place simply, inasmuch as, after introducing the selenite
plates, it is examined like a telescope. The bull's-eye of the ap
paratus concentrates a luminous <U+FB02>ame on the aperture of the po
larizing Nicol.
             Determination of the Light in a given space.
    If the horizontal microscope be placed in any part of the room,
the quantity of light which falls from above upon the object
decreases with increasing distance from the window, while that
sent upwards from the illuminating mirror directed towards the
sky remains the same. It is hence clear that the equilibrium
established in one place between the upper and lower illumina
tion ceases in another, and in this way the equally bright places
in the room are obtained.
    For photographic and, as I have heard, for ophthalmological
purposes, it is often desirable to have a de<U+FB01>nite illumination in
a room. I will assume that on a day of given brightness a pho
tographic view gives the desired result in a given time. The
microscope is placed vertically near the apparatus, and a <U+FB02>ame
removed so far from the illuminating mirror that compensation
is produced. To obtain the same light on repeating the process,

26            Prof. H. W. Dove on a New Photometer.
the distance of the lamp remaining the same, that position of the
‘room is sought at which compensation occurs. In fact, the
change in the brightness of the day’s light in weather which is
not quite clear, or when the sky is uniformly dull, is very con
siderable: this is best seen by directing the illuminating mirror
to di<U+FB02>erent parts of the sky, or by comparing the slight intensity
of the light re<U+FB02>ected from the blue sky with that of a whitish
sky. Hence I think this photometer adapted for travellers, whose
scienti<U+FB01>c out<U+FB01>t generally contains a microscope, or, as only a
feeble power is required, it can be easily added to it. Measure
ments of the intensity of light while the sun has a high position
in the southern hemisphere, compared with those made on the
northern hemisphere for the same height of the sun, are entirely
wanting. As, by the heating action of direct insolation, it must
be considerable, it will also be perceived in the photometric
results.
    It will perhaps be convenient to make special photographs
for this photometric process. Dickson’s monument has pro
 bably raised letters on a marble plate, by which the bright
 ness of the letters, where the shadow cooperates, is not the
 same all over the plate, from which the passage in the brighter
 and darker parts is not simultaneous. This difference is still
 more perceptible in the raised parts of the edge. The photo
 graph of an English bank-note shows the transition more uni
formly. The very <U+FB01>ne impression attacked my eyes when
 viewed too long. I should propose to make a copy of printing
 of uniform darkness and size, or a simple drawing, for example
 that of a black cross on a bright ground, or that of a dark ring
 upon the same ground. Copies of copper-plates are less well
 <U+FB01>tted, because this negative picture appears objectionably quaint.
 It will not be dif<U+FB01>cult to <U+FB01>nd the most convenient photograph
for such a purpose.
    The manufacture of suitable sliders with apertures decreasing
in size is also desirable.
    I would here mention a practical application of the method to
the estimation of colouring matters, the goodness of which, as
in the case of indigo for example, can usually only be ascertained
by direct inspection. The impression which such a substance
makes upon the eye depends exclusively on the quantity of light
which it sends to the eye, and on its colour. It is di<U+FB02>icult to
 make a prismatic analysis -with opake bodies, but it is not so
with an absorption analysis. Ultramarine appears quite black
when viewed through a glass coloured red super<U+FB01>cially; by
glasses of other colours it appears peculiarly coloured.       The
quantity of light which -it sends through such a glass may be

not easily given. If a. special colouring matter is to be deter
mined, it is only necessary to ascertain, by one of the methods
described, the darkening which it experiences by glasses of de<U+FB01>
nite colour. For a practical purpose, the special kind of glass
 need not be determined. In the hand of the practical man they
 are the known reagents for the colouring matter which he wishes
 to test.

                   By T. STERRY HUNT, F.R.S.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,                       Montreal, November 23, 1862.
      NCLOSED I send a translation of a little paper of mine
        from the Comptes Rendus, published in September last. It
 relates particularly to two papers, one by myself, and one by
 Schonbein, which have appeared in your journal, and I should
be much pleased to see it appear in your pages.
                         I remain, Gentlemen,
                                 Your most obedient Servant,
                                                  T. STERRY HUNT.
    In 1848 I suggested that free nitrogen is the nitryl of nitrous
acid, NHO4, NH3—H4 O4=NN, corresponding to the nitric
nitryl, NNOQ, and to the phosphoric nitryl, PNO52 (American
Journal of Science [2] v. 408 ; vi. 172 ; viii. 375). It might then
be supposed that, like these two bodies, nitrogen should under
favourable conditions <U+FB01>x H4 O‘, and regenerate nitrous acid and
ammonia. In April 1861 I published a note in ‘The Canadian
Journal’ of Toronto, in which it was said that the spontaneous
formation of these two bodies by the combination of atmospheric
nitrogen with water would serve to explain the production of
ammonia, so often remarked in the presence of air and reducing
agents, and also the formation of nitrates in the experiments of
Cloez, without the intervention of ammonia, and at the expense
of air and water in presence of alkaline matters (Comptes Renulus,
vol. lxi. p. 135).
    The simultaneous production of ozone and an acid of nitrogen
 by the electric spark, and during the slow oxidation of phos
 phorus, may be explained by the power of active oxygen to
 oxidize ammonia, thus setting free the acid of a small portion
of regenerated nitrite of ammonia, and even, in accordance with

 28 On the Nature ofNitrogen, and the T7ze0r_1/ ofNitri<U+FB01>cation.
 the observations of Houzeau, carrying its oxidizing action so far
 as to acidify the nitrogen of the atom of ammonia. Certain of
 the reactions attributed to ozone would thus, as many chemists
 have already maintained, be due to a minute portion of nitrous
 acid, which is formed when active oxygen is brought in contact
 with moist atmospheric nitrogen. On the other hand, the hy
 drogen set free by reducing agents may, by destroying the acid
 of the regenerated nitrite of ammonia, set free the ammonia of
 the salt, and even form a second atom by the reduction of the .
 acid (The Canadian Journal, March 1861).          These views will
 also be found in a note written by me, and published in the
'American Journal of Science for July 1861 (page 109), and
 copied into the Philosophical Magazine for September 1861,
 and the ‘ Chemical News.’ I found that a current of air which
 had passed through a solution of permanganate of potash acidu
lated with sulphuric acid, acquired the odour and the reaction of
 ozone. This disappeared when the air was passed through a
 solution of potash, which at the end of a certain time appeared
 to contain a nitrite.   This reaction, which seems to indicate the
 formation of nitrous acid, not by an electric or a catalytic action
 accompanying the production of ozone, but by the action of
 nascent oxygen upon atmospheric nitrogen in the presence of
 water, supports the above views, and, as I have remarked in the
,note in question, furnishes the key to a new theory of nitri<U+FB01>
 cation.
    The formation of nitrite of ammonia by the combination of
  the nitryl NN with H4 04, must necessarily be limited to very
‘minute quantities by the instability of this ammoniacal salt,
 which, as is well known, decomposes readily into nitrogen and
 water. In order therefore to produce any considerable quantity
 of a nitrite by this reaction, there is required the presence of
 active Oxygen or of a <U+FB01>xed base to separate the ammonia.
    The recent experiments of Schonbein have furnished new
 evidences of the direct formation of a nitrite at the expense of
 the nitrogen of the atmosphere. Accordingqto him, when sheets
 of paper moistened with a feeble solution of an alkali or an
 alkaline carbonate are exposed to the air, especially in the pre
 sence of watery vapour, and at a temperature of 50° or 60° C.,
 the alkaline base soon <U+FB01>xes a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of nitrous acid
'to give the characteristic reactions.  Appreciable traces of nitrite
 are, according to Schonbein, obtained in this way even without
 the intervention of an alkali. He moreover found that distilled
 water, mixed with a little potash or sulphuric acid, and evapo
 rated slowly at a temperature of 50° C. in the open air, <U+FB01>xes in
the one case a small portion of ammonia, and in the otheralittle
nitrous acid.    Traces of a nitrite are also formed in pure water

           Mr. J. Burgess on the Measurement of Attitudes.                  297
 under similar conditions.          Schiinbein explains all these results
 by the combination of nitrogen with the elements of water,
 producing at the same time ammonia and nitrous acid. As he
 has well remarked, this reaction serves to explain the absorption
  of nitrogen by vegetation, and, through the oxidation of nitrites,
  the formation of nitrates in nature. By these elegant experi
  ments, he has con<U+FB01>rmed in a remarkable manner my theory of
  nitri<U+FB01>cation, and of the double nature of free nitrogen. It is
 however evident that, since the publication of my note of March
  1861 referred to above, we cannot say with Schiinbein that the
  generation of nitrite of ammonia from nitrogen and water is “ a
  mostwonderful and wholly unexpected thing.” (Letterfrom Sch6n
  bein to Faraday, Philosophical Magazine, June 1862, p. 467).
 I cannot, however, admit with these gentlemen that the results of
 Schonbein are due to evaporation, except in so far asthe co
 operation     of water, of
 necessaryiconditions       and      slightly elevated temperature, are
                               thea reaction.
 IV. On the Measurement ofAttitudes by means of the Temperature
             at which Water Boils. By J. Bunoass, Esq.
       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
 SINCE Archdeacon Wollaston <U+FB01>rst employed the temperature
         of ebullition as a means of measuring altitudes, the subject
has been several times discussed. The late Mr. James Prinsep
calculated a table of heights corresponding to boiling-points for
every degree of temperature from 176° to 214° F., which was
employed by Colonel Sykes*, and has been several times
reprinted1' ; and, more recently, Professor J. D. Forbes, in 1843
and again in 1854, contributed two papers on the subject to the
‘ Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.’ By projecting
graphically the altitudes derived from barometrical measure
ments made by him among the Alps, but uncorrected for tem
pe1_'atu.re,-in- terms of the observed boiling-points, Professor
Forbes found that they lay almost exactly in a straight line.
Hence he inferred that “the temperature of the boiling-point varies
 in a simplearithmetical ratio with the hei_aht”I.

where B and B’ are the heights of the barometer at the lower
and upper stations respectively, h’ —k the difference of elevation
uncorrected for temperature, and L a constant. Now, if Pro
fessor Forbes’s hypothesis were true, we should have

T and T’ being the boiling-temperatures at the lower and upper
stations, or under the pressures B and B’ respectively. Hence
we obtain as the expression for the approximate difference of
elevation
                             h'—h=%(T—T'); . . . . . (2)
and the hypothesis is correct or otherwise, according as the quan
tity n is constant or variable.
    3. In the following Table are collected a number of observa
tions made by M. Izarn among the Pyrenees *, Dr. Forbes in the
 Alps1', Dr. Joseph Hooker on the Himalaya and Khasia
 Mountains 1, MM. Martins and Bravais on Mont Blane §,
 M. Marie on Mont Pila||, 8:0. In column (4) are tabulated
 the values of n derived from each observation, in (5) the boil
ing-points corresponding to the observed pressures in column
 (2) computed with n--—-112, and in (6) the differences between
the observed values in (3) and the computed ones in (5).
    After making allowance for errors of observation, it is mani
 fest from this Table that the value of a slowly decreases with the
 pressure. But so slow is the rate of decrease that Professor
 Forbes’s hypothesis affords good approximate results if, for heights
 under 10,000 feet, we employ n= 113'33 ; and, L being = 60369
feet, by substitution in equation          , we have

give the same results as the more complicated one of Regnault,

once derive the height in feet of the point at which water boils
at T° F., viz.

V. On the Motions of Camphor towards the Light. By JOHN
   WILLIAM Danna, M.D., Professor of Chemistry and Physio
   logy in the University of New York.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
I HAVE read with interest the very ingenious communication
      of Mr. Tomlinson, “On the Motion of Camphor towards
the Light,” inserted in the present (November) Number of the
Philosophical Magazine.
   In this communication Mr. Tomlinson considers the circum
stances under which camphor crystallizes on the sides of glass
vessels exposed to the sun, and the action of screens of tinfoil
and of other materials in preventing or removing those crystalli
zations.
   The conclusion at which Mr. Tomlinson arrives, respecting
the cause of these results, is as follows :--“I think enough has
been stated to prove that the motion of camphor, &c. towards
the light is really the effect of heat. . . . . The bottles exposed in
or near a window will always have one side colder than the other,
and this colder surface will determine the deposit.” “What
ever protects the bottles from radiation, either wholly or in part,
prevents the formation of deposits.” This simple and satisfac
tory explanation he considers to be altogether new, remarking
that he is “supporting a new theory against the united testi
mony of many philosophers,” and adding, “my presumption
might be pardoned if I ventured to propound an entirely new
theory as to the motions of camphor, &c. towards the light.’’ '
   The readers of the Philosophical Magazine are aware that
several years ago I published some experiments on these cam
phor motions. Those experiments Mr. Tomlinson has carefully
examined. They constitute, in fact, the avowed basis of his
memoir. As to the conclusion I arrived at, Mr. Tomlinson
remarks, “the result of Dr. Draper’s elaborate inquiry was to
multiply phenomena, and leave the theory as it was.’-’
   If Mr. Tomlinson will turn to page 135 of the Appendix of
the work he has quoted, or, better still, to the Philosophical
Magazine for February 1840, page 84, I think he will conclude
that this statement is scarcely correct, and that I had done some
thing more than leave the theory where it was. In a letter to
the Itditor of the Philosophical Magazine, I enumerated brie<U+FB02>y
the facts I had observed, and concluded by furnishing their ex
planation in the following words :—“ Now can we explain these
singular results on any other known principle than this—tha.t
the side of the jar nearest to the sun radiates freely the heat that
it receives back again, while radiation is interfered with at the

        Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.         39
  other side; that, in point of fact, the anterior side is the colder,
  and the other the hotter?”
     Such is the theory that I gave. It is the same as Mr. Tom
  linson’s.   The only difference between us is this,—that the con
  clusion I came to more than twenty years ago he has arrived at
  and considers to be new today.
     Of the correctness of that explanation I have never since had
  any doubt. To show how well it was understood at that time, I
  may add that the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine himself,
  in a foot-note to the communication in the Number of the Journal
  Ihave just quoted, made a suggestion for the purpose of remo
  ving one of the di<U+FB01>iculties which was in its way.
                                       Yours truly,

     VI. Mineralogical Notes. By Professor MASKELYNE and
          Dr. VIKTOR VON LANG, of the British Museum*.
                          [With Three Plates.]
            1. On Connellite. By Nevil Story Maskelyne.
      HE rare mineral Connellite has never had a satisfactory
         locality assigned to it. To an old specimen in the British
 Museum a label was attached which gave Chessy as its locality;
 but the aspect of the specimen, and the minerals it consisted of,
were not those by which the mineralogist recognizes the products
of that famous French working. All the few known specimens,
on the contrary, bear their united testimony to a Cornish source
of this beautiful mineral, from the manner in which a massive
and sometimes crystalline cuprite interveining quartz, carries
chrysocolla and often also cupreous arseniates as a coating, or in
small deposits in its hollows and <U+FB01>ssures. My attention had
been attracted to the mineral by the observation that the minute
blue velvet-like <U+FB01>laments which compose it seemed to possess
resplendent planes. Placing some under the microscope, they
proved to be distinct and beautiful crystals.
   During last autumn, Mr. J. M. Williams showed me his
splendid collection in Cornwall. I searched in it for specimens
of Connellite, and succeeded in <U+FB01>nding two or three drawers,
through which were scattered a few specimens of this most rare
and beautiful mineral. Theywere mingled with specimens of
Liroconite andCopper-mica ; and the drawers which had contained
them previously to their removal to Carhays Castle were stated
                     * Communicated by the Authors.

40     Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Nbtes;
by Mr. Williams to have been unopened for <U+FB01>fty years. With
the specimens were a few original labels, which exhibited, how
ever, only two kinds of inscription, viz. “Arseniate of copper,
Huel Unity,” and “Arseniate of copper, Huel Damsel.” It
was Professor Connell, after whom this mineral is deservedly
named, who <U+FB01>rst proved its old designation as an arseniate of
copper, to be erroneous. Messrs. Lettsom and Greg, in their
‘ Manual of British Mineralogy,’ mention Huel Providence and
Carharrack as reputed localities of this mineral. The latter
locality, from its proximity to the old Huel Unity (both mines
being now merged in what was till lately called the St. Day
United Mines), has not improbably been a source of it; but the
claim of Huel Providence to the production of Connellite is
problematical.
   The crystals of this mineral are extremely minute, the largest
not possessing dimensions greater than 7,-(‘nth of an inch in
thickness and about 11_0th of an inch in length. I have found
one with both terminations perfect, but of considerably smaller
dimensions than the above. The crystals belong to the hexa
gonal system, and exhibit ahexagonal pyramid formed of the
two rhombohedra 1 O0 and T22, sometimes terminating the
regular hexagonal prism (IOI) ; but more usually associated
also with scalenohedra, the one of which is the inverse of the
other, and the second hexagonal prism (2 1 1) truncating the
edges of the <U+FB01>rst.
   In crystals so minute, of which one presents as many as forty
eight planes on an area represented by the dimensions above
given, it would be almost impossible to obtain measurements of
any value by the ordinary re<U+FB02>ecting goniometer.
   But by means of a small plano-convex lens in front of a small
telescope with a magnifying power of about nine times attached to
the goniometer, andwhich converts that telescope into a sort of
microscope of low power, it is not di<U+FB01>icult to obtain measurements
of considerable exactitude. The adjustment is aided by screw
motions; and it is requisite to diminish the size of the aperture
for the light as much as is consistent with the adequate illumina
tion of the planes. When the faces are minute, and present a
plane surface and lustre, the method is exact enough. But
where the planes are curved, as is the case with the scaleno
hedra of Connellite, very accurate measurement is impossible.
   The angles obtained from the more perfect planes of this
mineral agreewith an angular element of (1 0 0) (1_l 1) =53° 10'.
   The planes on the crystal are

   The crystals (Pl. II. <U+FB01>g. 1)'are perhaps those from Huel Unity.
On a specimen from Huel Damsel, given me by Mr. Williams,
Ifound the form in <U+FB01>g. 2 ; and specimens from that locality (so
far as it was possible to assign particular labels to the specimens)
seemed more slender and <U+FB01>brous, in one case even asbestiform.
   Examined under the microscope by polarized light, the plane
of polarization was found to be parallel to the axis of the prism,
and the crystal proved to be devoid of dichroism.
      2. On a Crystal of Columbite from Monte Video.        By
                         N. S. Maskelyne.
   Some time since, W. Garrow Lettsom, Esq., Her Majesty’s
Minister and Consul-General at the Republic of Uruguay, sent
to the British Museum a crystal of Columbite. It was found
by him imbedded in granite in the neighbourhood of Monte
Video. Mr. Lettsom’s quick and accurate eye and intimate
knowledge of minerals enabled him at once to recognize the true
character of this crystal, and he extracted it from the rock con
taining it. Though split in the operation, the fragments, re
united, build up the entire crystal. He has searched persist
ently for others, but has not found one.
   It is a small lustrous crystal with a very dark brown streak,
and with a speci<U+FB01>c gravity of 5-660.            '
   It presents the planes (see Pl. II. <U+FB01>g. 3)-—

 (Sitzunysberichte der K. Akad. der Wissenschaften. Wren, 1861,

42      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang's Mineralogical Notes.
p. 445). Professor Miller’s indices are convertible into those of
Schrauf by dividing the .z' and z indices in his treatise by 3.
   Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity is high, coming near to, but being rather
higher than that of the variety. of the Ilmen Columbite, de
scribed by Hermann as possessing the highest speci<U+FB01>c gravity.
He places this limit at 5'73. In other respects, too, the Monte
Video Columbite exhibits a remarkable analogy with the Colum
bite of Ilmen.
   Schrauf has <U+FB01>gured (<U+FB01>g. 6 of his memoir) a crystal from the
Ilmen Mountains, and in <U+FB01>g. 4 one from Haddam, both presenting
much similarity to this crystal. They belong to the crystalline
type which he has called “ Habitus I. ;” and it is this “habit”
which the Monte Video crystal affects. There is, however, also
a crystal of the Ilmen Mountain Co1_umbite numbered 8 among
the specimens acquired with the Allan-Greg collection by the
British Museum.
   It is a very perfect little crystal, and presents a near resem
blance to that found by Mr. Lettsom. But its speci<U+FB01>c gravity
is 5969, a much higher one than even the highest assigned
by Hermann to the Columbite from the Siberian locality, and in
fact is that of some specimens from Bodenmais. But what
gives an important interest to this specimen, is the circumstance
that it carries a plane identical with a new plane on the Monte
Video crystal, viz. (1 5 0).                                          '
   The forms itexhibits are identical with those carried by the
Monte Video crystal, with the exception that the plane n is
absent (see <U+FB01>g. 4).
   A locality producing Columbite is almost sure to prove one of
much mineralogical interest when investigated. The analogy of
the Monte Video specimen to those from the Ilmen Mountains
may fairly justify the hope that so skilled a mineralogist as Mr.
Lettsom may yet bring to light other interesting minerals from
the Monte Video locality.
   The existence of the plane (I 5 0) is established by the follow
ing angles, each of which is the mean of three measurements on
various parts of the crystal :—

   There can be no doubt about the indices of this plane, as the
corresponding angles for the plane (1 6 0) are
     (010) (160)=22° 15’ and (130) (160) = 17° 2'.

3. On the C1-ysta-lline Form of Lani/zaniie. By Viktor von Lang.
   It has been hitherto supposed that lanthanite crystallizes in
the pyramidal system; but M. Descloizeaux found recently, in
the course of his   important researches on the optical properties
of minerals, that  lanthanite possesses two optic axes, the mean
line of which is    perpendicular to the perfect cleavage plane.
The crystals of     lanthanite must therefore be considered to
belong to the prismatic system.          M. Descloizeaux, when in
England this year, had the kindness to acquaint us with his
discovery; and I tried in consequence to determine also the
crystallographic elements of lanthanite, the mineralogical col
lection of the British Museum possessing small but tolerably
good crystals of this mineral from Bethlehem in Pennsylvania. ‘
   The crystals were found to be combinations of a prism m (1 1 O),
a pyramid 0 (1 1 1), and the two planes b (O 1 0) and c (00 1).
As the plane 0, which is at the same time a perfect cleavage
plane, predominates very much, the crystals have the form of
thin plates, the sides of which are bevelled by the small faces m
and 0, as is represented in <U+FB01>gure 5 of Plate 11.
   From the measurements I made, the parameters of lanthanite
were found to be
                    a : b : c=1 :0'9528 : O'94.~68.
From these values the following angles are calculated :

       4. On new forms of Mesotype.       By Viktor von Lang.
   The minerals mesotype, mesolite, and scolezite all crystallize
in prisms with angles varying little from 90 degrees, and hence
present much similarity in their external appearance. Provided
the crystals be not too small, the separation of the three species
 may easily be effected by the aid of the polarizing apparatus.
 Scolezite is recognized by the small. angle which the plane of
 polarization makes with the direction of the prism. This angle

 is zero for mesotype: placed in a cone of polarizedlight, we also
 <U+FB01>nd that in mesotype the <U+FB01>rst mean line must be parallel to the
 prism. Mesolite, on the contrary, shows in polarized light cer
 tain phenomena of interference, which were <U+FB01>rst observed by
 Descloizeaux, and which are certainly due to the complicated
 twin structure of these crystals. On submitting a prismatic
 crystal from a specimen which is labelled Brevicite in the minera
 logical collection of the British Museum, to the test of polarized
 light, I found that the plane of polarization was indeed parallel
 to the prism, but that the plane of the optic axes went across
 that direction; and it was possible even to see one of the optic
 axes next the limit of the <U+FB01>eld of view.
    The prism of this crystal, therefore, cannot be identical with
the prism hitherto known on mesotype, but must be parallel to
the axis a.    I measured several similar crystals, and found that
their planes are in simple relation to the planes which are already
known on mesotype. What convinced me still more that I had
to deal with crystals of this species was, that I found on the
back of the same specimen other crystals, which, although exhi
biting the well-known character of combination, showed also
several of the new planes previously found on the former kind
of crystals.
    The prism parallel to the axis a would be expressed by the
symbol (03 1) with the parameters used in the mineralogical
treatise of Brooke and Miller. But as this form determines the
character of combination, and as I even found a crystal twinned
on this plane, I think it more convenient to give to it the simpler
symbol (0 1 1), multiplying the parameter c with 3, which does
not alter the symbol of the face (1 1 0).
    For mesotype, therefore, the symbols of the known faces
become
            a(100)      m(110)     o(113)    3/(313),
and those of the new faces
 b(01 0) c(001) n(2 10) h(1 01) u(01 1) z(1 1 1) f(3 1 1).

 faces. Using the following angles given by Brooke and Miller, .

   The crystals are all very small (about one-tenth of an inch
across) and colourless; they occur in the cavities of a white
mass, probably of the same chemical composition. The crystals
being elongated parallel to the axis c, are combinations of the faces
a b 7n n .2 0, Pl. III. <U+FB01>g. 1. I found on a crystal of this kind the
angles                             mz = 3.‘; 3(l,
                                   m0 = 63 30.
The face f was observed cutting off the edge formed by the two
faces (1 1 1) and (1 1 O), and lying in one zone with them. I
measured
                  (111);             = 55 17 (313 4(lcalc.)
                  (111)(11o)=91 14(90 50 ,, )
Considering that the face was not very perfect, I think these
angles afforda suf<U+FB01>cient ground for assuming the symbol of f to
be (3 1 1).
   Another crystal on which the faces of the prism m were tole
rably good yielded me the following values for the angles of the

                                           0) = 95 37'

                             (1 1o)(1 10) = ss 56

pretty nearly parallel, as we <U+FB01>nd 9. mean value of

the faces (1 I O) and (I 1 O) deviate sufficiently from parallelism

    One crystal of this kind was found to lie a twin, <U+FB01>g. 2. The
two individuals crossed one another nearly at right angles, and
;:_he faces a and in both were in one plane. The twin face is there
  oreparallel to (0 1 1) , as for this twin face the two individuals
cross at angles of 94° 8' and 85° 52'. The crystal was so small
that itdwas impossible to measure angles formed by faces of the
two in ividua s.
    The crystals on which the prism (O 1 1) predominates are com
binations of the faces a b c nlzuz (<U+FB01>gs. 3, 4) ; the face 0 being
always more developed than b, and the face 2 occurring only
very seldom. None of these faces are very brilliant, and the
worst of it is that the face u is always curved, so that it was
found impossible to get an angle of the prism for measurement
except by a rough approximation.
    I found                  M = 26 16

    We see that the crystals of this kind are composed of faces
which, with the exception of the face a, are new.      As the angles
could not be measured with great accuracy, it might be supposed
that the face It is not a new face, but in fact identical with m.
But this is contradicted by the results obtained from the optical
properties exhibited by the crystal; for in the polarizing appal
ratus one <U+FB01>nds that the axis of greatest optical elasticity must
be parallel to the edge ab, and therefore this edge must be parallel
to the axis b; for the observations of Descloizeaux give the fol

that is to say, the axis of smallest optical elasticity (which is at
the same time the <U+FB01>rst mean line) is parallel to the greatest

              “/5. Aerolitics.   By N. S. Maskelyne.
    The branch of science that treats of Meteorites has acquired
su<U+FB02>icient importance to justify our giving it a special name, and
I therefore propose for it the denomination with which this article
is headed. Many reasons conspire to render this study of “ aero
litics ” one of increasing interest, and to make it highly desirable
that collections of meteorites should exist to illustrate it, as com

        Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.              47
plete as possible, not only in the numbers of the different
falls they represent, but also as regards the modes in which the
specimens are prepared for exhibition. These remarkable bodies
will always command a general interest, from the fact that in them
we see matter foreign in its origin and history to our own world,
and handle, in them, the only tangible substances that belong
to the space beyond our atmosphere. But the special interest
attaching to a collection of them arises from the fact that, while
they exhibit features of marked similarity, they withal, both as
regards their constituent minerals, and the manner in which
those minerals are mixed with each other, possess almost every
one of them a very distinct individuality. Moreover, every day
that the collection of specimens representing the older meteoric
falls is deferred, adds to the di<U+FB01>iculty of forming a complete
  cries of them. It was on these accounts that the small but
valuable collection that three years ago existed in the British
Museum, has since that period been very largely increased.
Towards the furthering of this object most valuable assistance
has been rendered by Governors of Colonies and Indian Presi
dencies, who have exerted their authority with a liberalit that
has been in one case indeed rivalled by the patriotism of a v uable
and learned body, the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. The result
of this and of the considerable acquisitions made by purchase,
has been that the aérolitic collection, which is an appanage to
the Mineral Department in the British Museum, has now risen
in point of material into the foremost place among such collec
tions in the world *.
    To accumulate so great a material is, however, but one step
towards the end which should be held in view in the formation
of a scienti<U+FB01>c collection. The next step consists in making that
material available for the uses of science, partly by a proper pro-,
paration and exhibition of the specimens, partl by a complete
description of them. I propose in this and subsequent papers
to contribute something towards the last of these objects.
    Yet when one approaches the subject with a view to undertake
    ' Every great collection has its own characteristic merits. If I may
 speak of that in the British Museum as the richest in material, taking the
 mass of the specimens as well as their numbers into consideration, it is
 with cordial pleasure that I express the highest admiration and respect
 for what I will not call a rival collection at Vienna. That collection is a
 classical one. Its specimens have been gradually collected, well described,
 and admirabl exhibited. That aiérolitics exists at all as a scienti<U+FB01>c sub
 ject is probab y due to the existence of, and the care bestowed on, that
 collection. In the cause of science it is to be hoped that persons in
 authority in Vienna may not feel any jealousy of the rising collection in
 London, but may be ready to exchange, to the mutual advantage of both
 collections, duplicate specimens of aérolites not common to the two.

 investigations in it, one cannot help feeling some disappointment,
 as well at the incompleteness of the chemical results that have
 been hitherto obtained, as at the unsatisfactory position of our
knowledge concerning the origin and the sources of meteorites.
Aérolitical science has to deal with the circumstances that
attend the fall of a meteorite, no less than with its mechanical
condition and its chemical composition ; and from the data thus
acquired it has to arrive at conclusions regarding the origin,
the motion, and the cosmical relations of the foreign matter that
thus wanders as it were into the atmosphere of our earth.
    The general literature of the subject is becoming very consider
able. Besides the tables and researches published by Mr. Greg in
our own country, and besides many papers of Baron Reichenbach
 in Poggendorif’s Annalen, Hofrath Haidinger has, by his active
pen and energetic mind, contributed, in Austria, perhaps more
valuable notices on the fall of meteorites than all other living
authors; and Dr. Laurence Smith, as well as Prof. Silliman, by
their accurate collection of facts and by their own investigations
as chemists, have done much for the subject in America, where
also the vigilant activity of Prof. Shepard has been conspicuous
in collecting and distributing the specimens themselves.
   The more special and exact literature, that, namely, which
details the work done on meteorites in the laboratory, carries
the names of the best inorganic analysts of this century, inclu
ding those of Rose, Wohler, and Rammelsberg. But if the pro
gress thus far made in either the general or the special parts of the
subject is not very large, it is at any rate enough to convince
us that we see with tolerable clearness the questions to which we
have to seek answers, and what are the cardinal points of interest
raised by the presence of a meteorite on our globe, and by the
circumstances attending its advent to it.
   The chemical methods adopted for the analysis of a meteorite
are probably unsatisfactory to every chemist who has employed
them. The separation of the olivinoid and soluble felspathic from
the insoluble felspathic, augitic, and other constituents, by the
action of an acid, is necessarily incomplete; and the assignment of
even empirical formulae for the augitoid and felspathic ingredients
is no less unsatisfactory. Yet in many meteorites it seems very
di<U+FB01>icult to conceive any better direct mode of operation. The
intimate manner in which the different minerals are sometimes
mingled, in what I may call a microscopic breccia, building the
structure of the minute spherules in some of those belonging to
the large group to which G. Rose has given the happy name of
chondritic meteorites, and the excessive subdivision of the nickel
iron which in in<U+FB01>nitesimal spangles is disseminated alike through
homogeneous spherules and through those which present this

         Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes‘.           49
  brecciated character,—these facts, which the microscope alone
  reveals, seem to bar the chemist from any complete mechanical
  separation of the ingredients of many meteorites, whether by the
  agency of a magnet, or by that of the selection, by the eye and
  hand, of distinct homogeneous pai-ticles*. Still there are cases
  in which analysis is possible; in some meteorites, as in that of
  Pai-nallee, the minerals are tolerably isolated from each other;
  and the fact that the chemist in dealing with such meteorites as
  those of Chantonnay, Stannern, Luotolax,Bokkevelde, andBishop
  ville, is enabled to place each of them as the characteristic
  member of a group, may <U+FB01>irnish ground for the hope that ap
 proximate methods may be found for at least determining the
 nature of the minerals contained in any given meteorite. One
 such method appears to be furnished by the microscope. A
 thin transparent section of an aérolite exhibits, under a low power,
 in a tolerabl characteristic way the minerals of which the aérolite
 is composed? By comparing these minerals as thus seen and as
 observed en masse in the specimen with the minerals that pre
 dominate in certain well-investigated and, so to say, standard types
 of meteorite, one soon learns to discriminate between them, and
 to predicate of any given individual aérolite, with what others
 it presents mineralogical analogies, though the assignment to
 each of these minerals of its precise place as a mineral species is
in some cases very difficult. Occasionally, however, as in the
coarser-grained varieties, one is enabled to discriminate and to
separate by mechanical selection for chemical analysis certain
mineral ingredients in a state of considerable purity.
    Ihave sought by these means to determine the lithological
character, if I may so call it, of some of the undescribed
meteorites in the British Museum. As a nomenclature is much
wanted in our la-ngua ‘e to represent what is so completely ex
pressed by the terms eteorstein and Meteoreisen in the German,
I propose calling the former (the meteoric stone) by the original
term Aiérolite, the meteoric iron by the term Aérosiderite, and
the intermediate varieties (including the Pallasites of Rose), in
which the iron is continuousand associated with silicate, by the
term Aérosiderolites or Siderolites. The term meteorite would
remain a generic expression for the whole.
    * Probably it would be found practicable to determine the iron indi
rectly by the estimation of the hydrogen developed by the treatment of the
aérolite with acids, under conditions convenient for collecting that gas.
The sulphuretted hydrogen might be estimated at the same time; and even
if it were all calculated as emanating‘ from meteoric pyrites, the ultimate
error in the analysis would be less than by a method in which the entire
se aration of the metallic iron is generally impossible, and the estimation
     ferrous oxide therefore as often too high.

             6. The Fall of Butsura, May 12, 1861.
   The group of aérolites that fell on May 12, 1861, on the banks
of the Gunduk, forty-two miles north-east of Goruckpur, pre
sents features of a general interest that claim for it a prominent
place among those to be described in these Notices. Five pieces
of that group were sent to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, at
Calcutta; and they have been thence forwarded to London,
where they were exhibited during the period of the International
Exhibition, at the British Museum. They have since been cut,
in directions agreed upon by Mr. Oldham on the part of the
Asiatic Society, and in .accordance with a liberal and patriotic
resolution of the Society to share with the National Museum in
London their valuable acquisitions in Indian aérolites. These
<U+FB01>ve stones fell at four distinct places south-west of the main
stream of the Gunduk, near the village of Mudbuni and on the
opposite side of the river to Butsura, which, as being the nearest
place indicated on the Royal Atlas of Johnston, is perhaps the
best to give its name to the fall (see Map). The four spots

    the north of, alittle place called Piprassi; the south-eastern
    angle is a little to the north-west of one called Bulloah. These
   points are some three miles apart. Two very small fragments,
    weighing about 5 and 7 ounces respectively, fell at the latter
   locality. A thin slab-like piece fell at the former. It weighed
   about 11 pounds. Of the other angles, one is formed by a spot
   called the Qutahar Bazar (described in one account as in the
   Thannah of Nimboah); this is the north-westerly angle. The
   southern angle is at a spot called Chireya. The stones that
   fell at these two points respectively weighed 13 lbs. and 8§lbs.
   These points, like the forme1', are some three miles apart; and
   whereas Chireya and Piprassi are only two miles, the northern
  point, Bulloah, and Qutahar Bazar are some three miles distant
  from each other.
      For the narrative of the circumstances accompanying the fall
  of these aérolites, I am indebted partly to Mr. Atkinson, the
  Secretary of the Asiatic Society, partly to my friend Dr. Oldham,
  _the Director of the Indian Geological Survey.
      The fall of the Qutahar Bazar and Chireya specimens was
  heralded by a report from out of a cloudless sky with a sound
  like that of ordnance, succeeded by several successive peals of
  seeming thunder. An appearance as of smoke was seen above
  the ground where they fell. One stone penetrated the soil for
  a cubit (= 18 inches) ; the other did so to half that depth.
      The two small fragments from Bulloah were accompanied by
 phenomena well substantiated by a near eye-witness.          A native
 was taking his cattle to the water, when he was startled by three
 very loud reports, and saw in the air on high "a light” (a
 luminous body), which fell to the ground within 200 yards of
 him. Here too the sky was serene, and the weather <U+FB01>ercely
 hot, but there was a very small cloud, out of which this witness
 stated the report and the luminous body to have come. “ First,”
he adds, “ there was the loud report, and about the same time I
saw the light like a <U+FB02>ame; then the stone fell, and in falling
made a great noise, and after it fell the sand was taken up high
into the air.” He went to the spot whence the sand had been
raised from the ground, and found there <U+FB01>ve pieces of stone.
They were very hot, and so was the sand all round, which was
thrown up to the height of a foot. Unfortunately only two of
these <U+FB01>ve fragments were preserved. Dr. Oldham further men
tions that the incandescent fragments in falling are stated to
have scintillated like iron when at a white heat.
     The Piprassi stone was seen to fall by a witness quite in
dependent of the other, but unfortunately from a much greater
distance. In the midst of the calm hot day, while sitting in a
<U+FB01>eld on the east side of the village of Piprassi, with many of the

  villagers, he states that they were startled by three loud reports
   succeeded by a rumbling sound which gradually died away.
  Their attention was immediately arrested by a cloud of smoke,
  which rose from the ground at about 1000 yards from them.
  They saw nothing like a falling bod , but they heard awhistling
  sound as of a bullet, but much lou er. The went to the spot
  and found the stone, round which the grave had been thrown

 ' Two hours after the fall, the serenity of the weather was in
  terrupted by a storm accompanied by a little rain.
     The reports of the explosion were heard at a distance of
  sixty miles from the locality.
     Dr. Oldham, on sending these most interesting aerolites to
  England, accompanied them by remarkable observations of his
  own. The two little Bulloah fragments <U+FB01>t exactly together,
 and both <U+FB01>t on to the Piprassi stone. The Chireya stone in like
  manner <U+FB01>ts with su<U+FB02>icient precision to that which fell at Qutahar.
  He surmised also that a careful adjustment would succeed in
 uniting all <U+FB01>ve fragments into a whole; and he indicated as a
 guide to this adjustment, a remarkable vein of iron which ran
 through the Piprassi and the Qutahar stones. I have since tried
 every possible means of effecting this; and though it is not
 practicable to <U+FB01>nd continuous surfaces of contact on the Piprassi
 and Qutahar stones, I have been enabled to determine the
 p:ecise position they must have occupied relatively to each other,
 and have modelled and constructed an intermediate piece which,
 allowing contact of the stones at one part, builds the whole of
 the fragments into one large shell-like piece, obviously itself a
 fragment of some far larger mass. But this presents also another
 point of great interest. The Bulloah and the Piprassi stones, at
 the contact surfaces by which they <U+FB01>t together, exhibit no crust,
 though in other respects coated with it. The Chireya and
 Qutahar fragments, on the other hand, present a crust hardly, if
 at all, distinguishable from that covering the rest of their mass,
on the very parts that form the faces of junction, and at which
they <U+FB01>t with unquestionable precision. These surfaces indeed
are smooth, and the edges very much rounded off, while those
of the Bulloah and Piprassi stones <U+FB01>t together with the exaetitude
of adjustment with which the portions of a broken piece of oolite
might be reunited.
    Before attempting to draw conclusions from these facts, I will
describe the general characters of the several fragments, in order
that all the data offered by this aerolitic fall may be given in
consecutive order.                                                 p
    The two that have been preserved out of the <U+FB01>ve stones that

       Prof. Maskelyne and ‘Dr. _Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.      53
fall at Bulloah are small fragments, <U+FB01>tting on, as before men.
tioned, to one of the long edges of the Piprassi stone. Probably
the whole <U+FB01>ve formed a long bar-like piece <U+FB01>tting on to that
edge, and these two would, in that case, constitute the half of it.
    The Bulloah stones (numbered 1 and 2 in the <U+FB01>gures on
Plate IV.) are rounded along their summits and sides, and
are there coated with a crust of a ooty black, and of dense
texture. On the surface of contact they and the Piprassi are
not crusted,      The material of which the interior of the Bulloah
stones is composed proves, when examined by a lens, to contain
a profusion of protruding points of metallic iron. It presents a
yellowish-brown ground-mass.          It is mottled with irregular
dark stains, which surround the metallic iron. This iron, asso
 ciated with a considerable amount of meteoric pyrites, is present
in this aérolite to a very high percentage. It is very evenly
distributed in small, isolated, irregularly formed and sometimes
crystalline-looking particles, not aggregated into a sponge, as in
the siderolites, but, as in the beautiful aérolite of Akbarpiir, the
grains of metal seem linked by a ferruginous or iron-stained
 mineral, which may possibly indicate the vestiges of a sponge
like structure of the iron at some earlier period in its history,
 when perhaps the silicates were less basic than at present, and
 less of the iron oxidized.
    Besides these ingredients, there are several very irregularly
 distribnted spherules of a mineral of the greenish-brown colour
 and translucency, as well as the lustre, of dirty bees-wax. It is
 somewhat transparent in thin sections, and presents the charac
 ters of olivine.
     A minute amount of iron pyrites occurs besides the meteoric
 pyrites; and a little of a_ very dark-coloured mineral is also pre
 sent, generally with a lustrous fracture, and perhaps occasionally
 somewhat crystalline.
 Ir In a section under the microscope with a power of one-inch
 focus, this aérolite does not prove to be a very remarkable one.
 The mass of it seems to consist of olivine. This is associated
 with a grey mineral, and also with one that is of an opake white.
 This grey mineral in some cases seems to constitute entire no
 dules of the aerolite, and sometimes seems mingled in the sort
 of brecciated mass, containing olivine crystals, that forms other
 nodules in it. It presents the appearance, in the former case,
 either of a dark mottled surface spangled with dark points (con
 sisting sometimes of iron, and in some cases curiously distributed,
  as if spurted through the mass from a centre), or of a mineral
 presenting very regular and minute parallel cleavage-planes
 with dark grey bars running along them, often rayed out like a
  fan, and with cross cleavages usually oblique, but at angles

  54 Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
  which vary with the inclination of the section to the axis of the
  crystal.
     There is also another mineral, transparent and presenting
  cleavages nearly perpendicular to each other, which appears to
  be distinct from the foregoing.
     What these minerals thus associated in small proportion with
 the olivine may be--whether they are solely augitic, or whether
 also the long felspathic-looking bars are really fragments of some
 felspar—-is at present di<U+FB01>icult to say with certainty. But in a
 subsequent article in these Notes I purpose giving all the data I
 possess for assigning to these and other meteoric minerals
 their true mineralogical character.
     The Butsura fall, therefore, seems, like other aérolites rich in
 iron, to approach in character to a siderolite in that the silicates
 it contains consist, as I believe, for the most part of olivine.
 This olivine is generally very transparent, and comparatively
 colourless ; but near the iron particles, and forming a continuous
fringe to them, its granules become of a ferruginous colour, and
 are at times, especially in parts of the Qutahar and Chireya
stones, red, like fragments of garnet or zircon.
    The meteoric pyrites is present in a ratio of about one-half the
apparent quantity to that of the iron. It is generally in little
independent particles of the same average size as those of the iron;
and it sometimes is continuous with the iron in the same particle,
like the copper and silver of Lake Superior.
    The Bulloah stone exhibits less of the ferruginous olivine than
the others around the iron, and may perhaps contain more of the
barred and grey mineral or minerals. The result is a paler hue
on it. Its crust, on the other hand, is thicker and coal-black,
that on the other stones having a browner cast.
    But the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the aérolite seems pretty constant
in its different parts, namely about 3'60.
    The next stone in order to the fragments that fell at Bulloah
is the thin slab-like piece that fell at Piprassi, marked 3 in the
<U+FB01>gures. One of the faces of this piece is convex, while the
other side presents a somewhat hollowed form. It is nearly
rectangular in its general outline. The inner, as well as the
outer, side presents some large but shallow hollows or “ pit
tings.” This piece, as before observed, does not <U+FB01>t on directly
to the great mass that fell at Qutahar Bazar ; but that it
formed a closely contiguous part to it on the original aérolite
there can be no doubt. In fact the general contour of the
stone, the correspondence of the outline and character of the
shallow hollows on both, and, <U+FB01>nally, the existence in them of
the remarkable vein of nickel-iron before alluded to, and which
runs persistently in one plane through each of them from the

      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes. 55
top to the bottom,—these all serve as guides to the restoration
of the original form of the aérolite, so far as these two parts of
it are concerned, and are the grounds of justi<U+FB01>cation for the
restoration of this part of the meteorite which I have attempted,
by moulding the small intermediate piece, to unite the two
stones, and which is marked on the <U+FB01>gure with the number 4.
The Qutahar stone, which becomes thus adapted to the Piprassi
piece, is a <U+FB01>ne mass of an irregular wedge shape (it is num
bered 5). The inner side is <U+FB01>tted with large shallow depres
sions, and presents a rather concave surface. The outer side is
<U+FB02>at and smooth. The base on which it stands, and which is the
result of the wedge-like form, is also smooth, rounded at the
edges, and presenting hollows and irregularities on one half of
 its surface, while to the side of this base, on the inner or just
 below the concave part of the stone, the irregular piece that fell
 at Chireya adapts itself. This last fragment (numbered 6) is
 somewhat pitted and deeply grooved on its upper side, and
 rounded everywhere else. Indeed, notwithstanding the pre
 cision with which it <U+FB01>ts to the Qutahar stone, the faces and
 edges at the parts of contact are rounded off so as almost to
 obliterate the original form of the stones at this part. The
  contour presented by the reconstructed mass, so far as the
  reuniting of these scattered fragments enables one to build it
  up, is that of a shell or the thick outer rind of one side of a
  considerable aérolite.
     The lithological character of the Piprassi, Qutahar, and Chi
  rcya stones is very similar to that of the Bulloah pieces. But
  there are differences between them worthy of being noticed.
  Thus the crust on them is not very di<U+FB01>°erent from the dense black
  crust that coats those of Bulloah; it is, however, less charac
  teristic and less thick. They are all dull, as the crusts on highly
  olivinous meteorites generally are, as contrasted with the shining
  enamels on the felspathic-augitic kinds. It exhibits crystalline
  metallic-looking points, as well of iron as of meteoric pyrites
  and, at very rare intervals, of iron pyrites, that are disseminated
  among small globular projections of a pitch-black colour. It is
  these black projections, on the other hand, that constitute the
  whole mass of the Bulloah crust. But in the three larger
  masses the crust assumes a dirty blackish-brown hue.
     The facts above recorded appear to me to throw some light
  upon several interesting questions.

  the S.E. of the heavier ones; the Bulloah three miles S.E. of
  Piprassi ; the Chireya a similar distance E.S.E. of Qutahar. If
  we suppose that the disruption of all the stones was simul

56 Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
taneous, we might further assume that they fell with a diverge
ing <U+FB02>ight; for the Qutahar Bazar and Piprassi points are
considerably further asunder than those of the Bulloah and
Chireya falls. In fact, a line passing from the E.S.E. to W.N.W.
would represent the direction of the <U+FB02>ight of the aérolite ; and
if we are to judge by the different divergences of the stones, that
<U+FB02>ight would not have been at a great inclination to the horizon.
   Had it been quite horizontal, the point of divergence would
have been, on this view, about seven miles E.S.E of the central
point of the fall, and two miles N.W. of Mudbuni. As, how
ever, it would seem to have fallen from a considerable elevation,
it may have been much further 03, though the point of disrup- *
tion would have been somewhere nearly vertical over the position
thu indicated.
   But this fall is remarkable for the evidence it affords of the
incrustation of an aerolite subsequently to its disruption, as
well as of the probabilit of successive disruptions, of which
one, at least, was not fol owed by incrustation. In the great
Pamallee aérolite, and still more in that which fell at Bustee,
we have cases, of which indeed every collection must exhibit
some more or less evident examples, showing crusts on different
parts of an aérolite that seem not to have been contemporaneous—
where, in fact, the crust on one part has not the thickness and
homogeneity that characterizes that on another part. The follow
ing, in the British Museum collection, are cases inpoint: Stannern,
Bokkeveldt, Benares, l’Aigle, and Mezo-Madaras. These facts
are among those we have to explain. On the present occasion
they were accompanied, according to every witness, by reports
in the air, and by a subsequent roll of thunder. In two cases
the distinct reports were three in number. There was a cloud
in the sky, out of which the aerolite seemed to descend ; while
at Bulloah the stone or stones were seen to fall as a luminous
body, which at some part of its path appeared to scintillate in
the air. The shell-like form, too, of the united fragments, in
suggesting the idea of an internal core or mass from which the
external pieces have been severed, recalls to mind the suggestion
of Mr.'Benjamin Marsh, that the bursting of the meteorite
is the result of the expansion produced by heat. If we couple
with Mr. Marsh’s suggestion the remarkable explanation by
Hofrath Haidinger of the intense coldness declared to have been
exhibited by the Dhurmsala stones after their having fallen
quite hot, I believe that suggestion will prove a very fertile
one. The coldness of cosmical space must be shared by bodies
wandering therein without atmosphere.
   Such a body entering with planetary velocity the terrestrial
atmosphere, is arrested in its course with an abruptness of which

      Prof. Maakelyne and Dr, Lang’s Mineralogical Notes. 57
it is as di<U+FB02>icult to get a clear conception as is that velocityitself.
The intense heat instantaneously developed on the surface of
the mass will assuredly be su<U+FB02>icient to melt that surface down
into an enamel, before it could have time to penetrate to even
a sensible depth into the body. If, as is probable, this fused and
white-hot enamel <U+FB02>ies off from the mass as it proceeds with the
scream of a huge projectile through the air, its place will be
continually taken by a fresh and continuously <U+FB02>owing stream of
the same incandescent material.         That material, too, is com
bustible,     The metallic iron in many an aérolite ranges above
20 per cent., and is associated with sulphur as pyrites, and
sometimes in other forms. Here at least is cause for much,
if not a su<U+FB02>icient cause for the whole, of the spectacle exhibited
by the blaze of a meteor. That the air itself is also heated to
whiteness, and as such becomes visible, as Haidinger suggests,
is highly probable, and would add still more to the brilliancy
of the light.
    But while the enormous velocity of the body is thus instanta
neously arrested and converted into heat, the effect of that heat
will not be exhibited in the molten pray of enamel alone. The
 heated surface will gradually, but by no means slowly, impart
 its heat to the interior; and notwithstanding the non-conducting
 character of the stony ingredients of an aerolite, the outer por
 tions (a sort of shell around it) will rapidly rise in temperature.
 The coldness of the interior would only gradually be overcome,
 and, long before it would be so, the expansion of the external
  parts would tend to tear them away from a contracted and far
 more than ice-cold core within. The limits and the form of that
  core, the conditions under which disruption would ensue (indeed,
  whether it would ensue at all, as it would not if the mass were
  absolutely homogeneous), would depend on the structure of the
  mass, its directions or planes of weaker aggregation, or perhaps
  the unequal distribution in it of matter of various degrees of
  conductibility. But when the disruption comes, it must come
  with explosion.                                              '
     The process may be repeated, or it may take place at different
  intervals on the different sides of the meteorite. The earlier
  ex losions may take place at points in its path where there is
  st' velocity enough to produce a fresh enameling,—-sometimes
  in a copious <U+FB02>ow, at others only enough‘ to barely glaze the ex
  posed surface of the stone again ; the later ones may occur when
  the velocity is more nearly spent, and the friction is no longer
  competent to generate the glaze.
     The cloud in the air, out of which the meteorite has been seen
  tocome in so many authenticated instances, would be satis

factorily explained by the dust of the enamel after its separation
from the aérolite in its course, and the combustion of its iron,
sulphur, &c. 3 perhaps, also, small fragments are splintered and
<U+FB02>y off by ‘the same principle as the larger ones, and, partially
burning, become dust too.
   Following in the track of the body, this dust would soon,
however, linger behind it and hang in the air like a vapour-cloud,
as is often seen to be the casein the wake alike of a meteor and
of a meteorite.
   Finally, if the reports represent the successive concussions of
the air produced by the disruption of the aéirolite (and reaching
the ear generally in the inverse order of their occurrence in time),
we must attribute the “thunder” that is so often described as
succeeding the reports, to the echo of the reports themselves.
   That a noise, the true extent of which is likely to be exagge
rated, should be heard over so large a range of country as sixty
linear miles, is perhaps not so surprising when we consider the
distance to which a small cannon can be heard, even over a
surface of country teeming with obstacles and air-currents cal
culated to impede the passage of the sound; whereas from a
height of two or three miles in a still, clear air, the spread of
even a comparatively small sound over an area with a radius of
thirty or forty miles seems nothing astonishing. To me, at least,
who have heard the roar of a train between Shrivenham and
Swindon, as I stood, on a still night, in the station at Cirencester,
a distance of certainly nearly twenty miles, such a wide promulga
tion of a sound in the air is no more di<U+FB02>icult to understand than
it is to credit the assertion of our aéronauts, who a few months
back heard a musical instrument played on the earth when their
balloon was some three miles above the ground.         That this pro
pagation of the sound of a cannon or a train is not due to the
conduction of the earth, is proved by the fact that it is only in
certain states of the atmosphere, independent of wind, that it
occurs.
   The cause to which I have assigned the disruption of a me
teorite, and the reports which accompany it, may also furnish
an explanation of the great size of some aérosiderites and sidero
lites, as compared with that of the largest stones. The more
rapid conducting power of the metal, as well as its greater power
of resisting a divellent force, would—perhaps after a <U+FB01>rst dis
ruption—tend to prevent the repeated breaking up of the mass;
and this may be the case in many instances, notwithstanding
the fact that in others meteorites of this kind have fallen in
associated and perhaps dissevered masses or even in showersy

“ With 15 things, to form 35 triads involving all the 105 duads.”

  <U+FB01>rst pentad of triads is abc, d 35, e 17, f 82, g 64, and so for all the
  seven pentads of triads), there is obviously a division of the 15
  things into (7+8) things, viz. the 35 triads are composed 7 of
  them each of 3 out of the 7 things, and the remaining 28 each of
  I out of the 7 things, and 2 out of the 8 things: or attending
  only to the 8 things, there are 28 triads each of them containing
  a duad of the 8 things, but there is no triad consisting of 3
  of the 8 things. More brie<U+FB02>y, we may say that in the system
  there is an 8 without 3, that is, there are 8 things, such that no
  triad of them occurs in the system.
      I believe, but am not sure, that in all the solutions which have
  been given of the school-girl problem there is an 8 without 3.
      Now, considering the more simple problem, there are of course
  solutions which have an 8 without 3 (since every solution of the
 school-girl problem is a solution of the more simple problem):

  but it is very easy to show that there is no solution which has a
  9 without 3. I wish to show that there is in every solution at
  least a 6 without 3. This being so, there will be (if they all
  exist) 3 classes of solutions, viz. those which have at most (1) a
  6 without 3, (2) a 7 without 3, (3) an 8 without 3. I believe
  that the <U+FB01>rst and second classes exist, as well as the third, which
  is known to do so.
     The proposition to be proved is, that given any system of 35
  triads involving all the duads of 15 things ; there are always 6
  things which are a 6 without 3, that is, they are such that no
  triad of the 6 things is a triad of the system. This will be the
  case if it is shown that the number of distinct hexads which can be
  formed each of them containing a triad of the system is less than

  system a triad formed out of the remaining 12 things (there are
  li'_1;ig=4.5.11=22o such triads), we obtain in all
  (220x35=)7700 hexads, each of them containing a triad of
  the system. But these 7700 hexads are not all of them distinct.
  For, <U+FB01>rst, considering any triad of the system, there are in the
  system 16 other triads, each of them having no thing in common
  with the <U+FB01>rst-mentioned triad. (In fact if e. g. 123 is a triad
  of the system, then the system, since it contains all the duads,
  must have besides 6 triads containing 1., 6 triads containing 2,
  and 6 triads containing 3, and therefore 35-1 —6—6—6= 16
  triads not containing 1, 2, or 3.) Hence we have ( 35:.216 =)28o
  hexads, each of them composed of two triads of the system; and
  since each of these hexads can be derived from either of its two
  component triads, these 280 hexads present themselves twice over
  among the 7700 hexads.
     Secondly, there are in the system seven triads containing each
  of them the same one thing, e. _q._
  123,    145,    167,    189, 1.10.11,          1.12.13,      1.14.15,

 of the system, and they present themselves once among the
 7700 hcxads.      This number is consequently made up as follows,

 or there are in all 4270 distinct hexads ,- and since this is less
 than 5005, it follows that there are hexads not containing anytriad
 of the system: there must in fact be (5005—4-270:) 735 such
 hexads. The theorem in question is thus shown to be true.

            VIII. Note on 11 Theorem relating to Surfaces.
                        By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
       HE following apparently self-evident geometrical theorem
         requires, I think, a proof; viz. the theorem is——“ If every
 plane section of a surface of the order m+n break up into two
 curves of the orders m and 1» respectively, then the surface
 breaks up into two surfaces of the orders m, n respectively.”
     To <U+FB01>x the ideas, suppose n=2. Imagine any line meeting
 the surface in m+2 points, the section includes a conic which
  meets the line in two of the m+2 points, say the points A, A’1'.
  Suppose that the plane revolves round the line AA’, the section

before-mentioned branch is this conic; that is, the conic APA
by its intersection with an arbitrary plane traces out a conic;
or, what is the same thing, the sheet, the locus of the conic
APA', is met by an arbitrary plane in a conic, that is, the sheet
is a surface of the second order; and the given surface thus
includes a surface of the second order, and is therefore made up
of two surfaces of the orders m and 2 respectively. The demon
stration seems to me to add at least something to the evidence
of the theorem asserted, but I should be glad if a more simple
one could be found. Analytically, the theorem is—“ If
                             (w. 2/. z, ~w+B.1/+12) m+n ,
where (a, ,8, y) are arbitrary, break up into factors (.1, ,1/, z)”',

breaks up into factors (.z', 3/, z, w)"‘, (a', y, z, w)", rational in
regard to (a', 3/, z, w).” It would at <U+FB01>rst sight appear that
(a, B, y) being arbitrary, these quantities can only enter into
the factors of (.z', y, 2, aa:+B_1/+-yz)"'+” through the quantity
ax +83/+ryz; that is, that the factors in question, considered as
functions of (.z', y, z, a, /9, y), are of the form
           (.22, 3/, 2, a.z'+,8_z/+ry2)'”,  (a', y, z, aa:+,8_1/+'yz)";
and then replacing the arbitrary quantity a.z'+ /3;/+ryz by w, the
factors of (x, y, z, w)"‘+" will be (m, y, z, w)'”, (.22, 3/, 2, w)“. But
this reasoning proves too much; for in a similar way it would
follow that if (.z', 3/, am + ,3;/)'”+”, where ix, /3 are arbitrary, breaks
up into the factors (.z', 3/)"', (.12, 3/)", rational in regard to (.z', 3/)

break up), then (x, y, z)”'+" would in like manner break up into
the factors (.z', y, z)"', (.z', y, 2)", rational in regard to (.z', _1/, .2).
And a simple example will show that it is not true that the factors
of (r, .1/, u.z'+/3_1/)"'+" only contain (oz, /3) through a.z'+/8y; in
fact, if the function be =.z"+g/“+(u.Z'+['3,1/)2, then the factor is

 IX. Experiments on the Calori<U+FB01>c Conductibility of Solids. By
    F. NEUMANN, Professor of Physics in the University of K6
    1u'_1]sber_q*.
      WILL <U+FB01>rst describe in a few words the method which I
       have used. First, I do not observe the stationary, but the
 variable condition of temperatures; and it is the rapid convergence
 of the trigonometric series by which this variable state is repre
 sented, which enables it to serve for the determination of con
 ducting powers; the <U+FB01>rst terms of the series are sufficient, when
 the time t is tolerably large: secondly, the bars used have not to
 undergo any deformation which escapes calculation : thirdly, this
 condition is realized by introducing into the bar to be studied
 very slight thermo-electric piles, formed of an iron wire and a
 german silver wire, which are soldered in the bar; as long as
 the temperatures of the solderings are between 0° and 100°, the
 intensity of the current is proportional to the differences of tem
 peratures ; and this law differs so little from the truth, that it
 may be assumed to be exact : fourthly, the absolute values of the
internal and eztemal comtuctibilities may be determined simulta
 neously by my method.
    The bars used were 3 or 4 lines in the sides. The two thermo
 electric rods were soldered at a short distance from the end
 of each bar, and their wires were connected with a differential
galvanometer of a special construction, by means of which the
sum and the difference of the two currents which traverse the
piles may be exactly measured.
    One of the ends of the bar thus prepared, was heated by a
<U+FB02>ame until the temperatures attained the state of equilibrium;
the <U+FB02>ame was then removed, and at the expiration of a certain
time the sums and the differences of the intensities of the two
currents were observed; they were thus obtained as a function
of the time, the isochronous oscillations of a magnetized needle
serving as chronometer. The duration of the oscillation of my
apparatus was eight seconds, and I could therefore determine
the intensities of the currents every eight seconds. It will be
already seen that the differences of the intensities depend essen
tially on the internal conductibility, while the sums correspond
to the external conductibility; and analysis leads in fact to this
result, that the ratios of the sums successively observed are ex
pressed by the same constant, and the successive differences by
another constant. The combination of these two constants gives
then the absolute values of the two conducting-powers.
    In some experiments I also replaced the bars by rings, the
rods being then <U+FB01>xed in two points diametrically opposite.

    The <U+FB01>rst observations which I made in this way, three years
ago, only refer to the course of the experiments; but then it
was necessary to use at least two bars of different lengths, or
rather two rings of different diameters, to determine at one time
the coe<U+FB02>icients of external and of internal conductibility. I found
in this way the following numbers for the internal conductihility
of some metals, of which I determined at the same time the

another met od. I made cubes 5 or 6 inches on the side, or
spheres of the same diameter. These bodies, having been uni

cooling had lasted a certain time (which was from half an hour
to an hour), the temperatures at the centre and at the surface
were observed, by means of the thermo-electric rods already
mentioned. Their in<U+FB02>uence on the_course of the temperatures
may always be estimated by calculation. In this way I obtained
the following values for the ratio %, It being the calori<U+FB01>c con

 The relative values of snow and frozen earth may serve for a
 future theory of the freezing and thawing of the earth’s surface,
 which may lead, perhaps, to an explanation of the glaciers of
 Siberia. Rocks present marked di<U+FB02>iculties in respect of their
 calori<U+FB01>c conductibility ; and it is indispensable to know them to‘
 account for the motion of heat in the interior of the globe.
 Thus,I found $ =12'9 in a coarse-grained granite, and =7'0
in a serpentine from Toplitz.
    The only serious di<U+FB01>iculty which prevents perfectly accurate
results from being obtained by this kind of observation, is the
very distinct variation of the conductibilities with the tempera
ture. Unfortunately the theory of heat is still, so to say, in its
infancy as concerns the laws according to which these variations
take place.

“Experimental Researches to determine the Density of Steam at
different Temperatures, and to ascertain the Law of Expansion of
Superheated Steam” (Phil. Trans. 1860, p. 185), it was shown that
although Dumas, Gay-Lussac, and‘other ‘distinguished physicists
had determined the density of steam at 212°, it was, however, left for
these researches to ascertain the -law of density, volume, 820. at all
temperatures, and also the law of expansion of superheated steam.
These experiments have therefore been continued, and have elicited
 remarkable results as regards therate of expansion at various tempe
 ratures.
     The earliest experiments on this subject were made by Mr. Frost
 in America, but without sufficient accuracy to be of scienti<U+FB01>c value.
 Mr. Siemens has also experimented on steam isolated from water ;
 his results give a much higher rate of expansion for steam than for
  ordinary gases; but, owing to some obvious defects of Mr. Siemens’s
  method of conducting the experiments, we consider his results are
  not reliable.
     For gases, the rate of expansion is expressed by the formula for
  constant volume,
                                                                  .-(1)

  where E is a constant determined by experiment, and decided by
  Regnault as 459 in the case of air. In the paper alluded to, it was
  shown that, with a certain proviso, the rate of expansion of super
  heated steam nearly coincided with that of air. Within a short
  distance of the maximum temperature of saturation the rate of ex
  pansion of steam was found to be exceedingly variable; near the
  saturation-point it is higher than that of air, and decreases as the
  temperature is increased, until it becomes sensibly identical with
  that of air. The results upon which this law was based were too
  limited in their range for much numerical accuracy in the constants
  deduced.
      Hence it has been our object in the present paper to supply the
  de<U+FB01>ciency in the previous one, by affording experimental data of the
  expansion of steam at higher temperatures and with a greater range
  of superheating than was possible with the apparatus employed in
  ascertaining the density of steam.      The results obtained in these
  later experiments, however, con<U+FB01>rm the general law deduced from the
  previous ones.
      The <U+FB01>gure represents the apparatus used when the pressure did
  not exceed that of the atmosphere, consisting of a glass globe (a)
   3 inches in diameter, and stem 35 inches long; the capacity was
  known to a point (6), where a piece of platinum wire was twisted to
  mark accurately the point at which the mercury column in the stem
  was to be brought to maintain a constant volume in the globe.

    To correct for temperature, 7-} inches of mercury, enclosed by the
oil-bath and its stu<U+FB01>ing-box, were corrected for the temperature of
the oil, and the remainder of the column for the temperature of the
atmosphere at the time. By deducting the column so corrected from
the reading of the barometer at the time, the total pressure in the
globe is obtained. The readings of the thermometer are corrected
for the portion out of the oil-bath. The pressure of mercurial vapour
is calculated from data supplied with great courtesy by M. Reg-nault,
and embodying the results of unpublished experiments. The pres
sure of this vapour is assumed to be the same as that in a vacuum,
as the vapour in the globe remains still for a sufficient time (it is
believed) for saturation to take place. In this view we have been
strengthened by M. Regnault’s opinion. By deducting the pressure
of mercury vapour from the total pressure in the globe, the pressure
of the steam is obtained.
    On referring to the experiments contained in the paper, it will be
seen that the law of expansion of gaseous bodies is expressed by the
formula
              E-l-t =gL_           _.   E=PVt1-P,V,t
              E+:, PV,’                     P,V,- PV ’
where E is a constant.    Taking Regnault’s constant 459 as the rate
of expansion of air for constant volumes, a remarkable coincidence
will be observed in the experiments contained in the paper when
reduced to the same standard of value. The values of E thus
deduced have been placed in the last column of the calculated experi
ments. They show a decreasing rate of expansion from the satura
tion-point upwards, until at no great increase of temperature the rate
of expansion coincides with that of a perfect gas.
    Taking from the Tables the two results, which in each instance

     “On the Total Solar Eclipse of July 18, 1860, observed at Riva
 bellosa, near Miranda de Ebro, in Spain.”—The Bakerian Lecture.
  By Warren De la Rue, Esq., F.R.S.
    The Lecturer gave an account of the more interesting phenomena
  of the eclipse, and of the methods employed in observing and
 recording them; the details of his observations being given in an
 elaborate Paper bearing the above title. The Lecture was illustrated
 by a great number of diagrams and models. The photogra hic
 images of the eclipse were projected on a screen by means 0 the
 electric lamp, and some of the more striking phenomena were imi
 tated by apparatus contrived for that purpose.
    The following is an abstract of the Paper :—
    The author, for some time previous to the organization of the
 Astronomer Royal’s expedition to Spain, had contemplated making
 an attempt to photograph the phenomena of the total eclipse of
July 18th, 1860, but as soon as he was infdrmed of the Astronomer
 Boyal’s views he agreed to join his party, now known as the
 Himalaya Expedition, from the name of Her Majesty’s ship which
conveyed the astronomers composing it to Spain. He attributes
much of the success of his operations to the admirable arrange
ments of Professor Airy in England, and to those concerted with Mr.
Vignoles in S ain; for he was able in consequence greatly to increase
the extent of is preparations, and to convey a complete temporary
observatory <U+FB01>tted up with all the numerous requirements which are
essential in astronomical photography.     Besides himself, his party
consisted of Mr. Beckley of the Kew Observatory, Mr. Reynolds
(now Mr. De la Rue’s private assistant), Mr. Downes, and Mr. E.
Beck, and subsequently the late Mr. S. Clark. The author expresses
himself greatly indebted to these gentlemen for their most efficient
assistance.
   The party took up their station at a village called Rivabellosa,
situated near the town of Miranda de Ebro; the site selected was a
thrashing-<U+FB02>oor, on which the observatory was erected.
   The instruments employed consisted of the Kew heliograph, for
the photographic records; an achromatic telescope, by Dallmeyer,
mounted on a sort of alt-azimuth stand contrived by the Astronomer
Royal, which permitted of an equatorial movement by the ingeni
ously arranged joint action of two racked radius bars.   To this tele- '
scope the author <U+FB01>tted a diagonal eyepiece of his own contrivance,
which allowed of the use of re<U+FB02>exion from plain glass in the <U+FB01>rst

 70                        Royal Society :—
instance, and then from a portion silvered on the top surface the
 instant the period of totality commenced. By its means he avoided
 the perplexity and loss of time occasioned in unscrewing and screwing
 portions of the apparatus at the most critical period. To these were
 added a small transit theodolite, three chronometers, two baro
 meters, and several thermometers.
  ‘ The weather proved so unpropitious that it was with much diffi
culty the objects of the party could be carried out ; and it was only
by using every available opportunity that even the Kew instrument
could be placed in position.
_ The geographical position of the site of the observatory was ascer
tained to be—north latitude 42° 42’, west longitude 11 min. 427
sec., elevation above the mean high-water mark l572'4 feet.
    The author made two sketches of the luminous prominences
during the period of totality, on paper previously ruled to represent
the position-lines drawn on a piece of parallel glass placed in the
focus of the eyepiece, which magni<U+FB01>ed about 60 times.           These
position-lines consisted of a square calculated to exactly include the
lunar disk, and two external squares, one _'exactly one minute of arc
distant from the central square_ and from the other. The angles of
the squares were joined by diagonal fainter lines. The whole
system was moveable through an arc of 90°, and its position could
be read off on a graduated external circle divided from 10 to 10
degrees. The drawings were by chance made of nearly the exact
diameter of the lunar disk in the photographs (4 inches), and proved
very valuable in interpreting the phenomena revealed by the latter,
as the one could be compared by superposition with the other, and
the several prominences be thus identi<U+FB01>ed.
    One of the prominences, situated about 30° from the north point
towards the east, became visible several minutes before totality, even
during the employment of the unsilvered portion of the diagonal
re<U+FB02>ector.   As the sun disappeared the author watched for the so
called Baily’s beads, but no such phenomenon occurred, which
occasioned no surprise to him, as he had always believed that it arose
in all probability from the atmospheric disturbance of an image
formed by a telescope wanting in de<U+FB01>nition.
    The author goes on to describe the various appearances presented
by the several protuberances, which were not all of a rose-colour,
and those which presented this hue were much paler in colour than
his previous reading had led him to expect. He is able to speak
with considerable certainty on this point, having before the eclipse
painted several colours on his drawing-paper, and was thus enabled
to compare these directly with the prominences by means of the
light emitted by the corona, it being su<U+FB01>iciently great and polychro
matic for that purpose. The light of a lamp which was at hand
proved not only useless, but was detrimental in making the com
parisons. There was a considerable amount of detail, both of form
and colour, in the prominences, which the author has shown in two
coloured drawings which accompany the paper; these are founded on

  Mr. De la Rue on the Total Solar Eclipse of July 18, 1860. 71
the original sketches, which are also given in fac-simile, but to some
 extent corrected by means of the photographs.
    That the prominences belong to the sun and not to the moon was
 rendered evident to the observer by the progressive covering of the
 luminous prominences on the east in the direction of the moon’s
 motion, and the gradual uncovering of fresh prominences on the west ;
 while prominences situated in a position nearly at right angles to
 the moon’s path shifted their angular position on the moon’s edge
 several degrees during. the observations. The prominence which
 became visible before totality, which the author designates by A,
was found to have shifted 3° 25' on the moon’s limb in an interval
 of about 2% minutes; it was therefore evident that the region of the
 moon which at the commencement of the period was in apparent
contact with the prominence was at some distance from it at the end;
and as the prominence underwent no change during that time, the
theory falls to the ground which ascribes the phenomenon of the
luminous protuberances to some peculiar action of the moon’s edge
on light coming originally from the sun.
   The author describes the general e<U+FB02>'ect of the eclipse to the unas
listed eye. He was particularly struck with the peculiar illumination
of the surrounding landscape as the sun became reduced to a small
crescent ; the shadows of all objects were so sharp and the light so
brilliant that it reminded him of the illumination produced by the
electric light ; at the same time peculiar hues were assumed by the
sky and landscape, which suggested the idea that the light of the sun
near the periphery is not only less intense than that of the centre,
but that it may be different in quality.
   No attempt was made to obtain accurate observations of the corona,
but nevertheless a few seconds were devoted to this phenomenon.
Even several minutes before totality the whole contour of the moon
could be distinctly seen; when totality had commenced, the moon’s
disk appeared of a deep brown in the centre of the corona, which was
extremely bright near the moon’s limb and appeared of a silvery
white, softening off with a very irregular outline and sending forth
some long streams. It extended generally to about from 0'7 to 0'8
of the moon’s diameter beyond her periphery.
   The darkness during the totality was not nearly so great as might
have been expected from accounts of previous total eclipses.       The
illumination was markedly distinct from that which occurs in nature
 on any other occasion, and certainly was greater than on the brightest
 moonlit night, although at the time the light appeared to the author
 as less bright than what he remembered of bright moonlight. By
 subsequent trials he was led to conclude that the light during a
 total eclipse most resembles that degree of illumination which exists
 in a clear sky soon after sunset, when, after having made out a <U+FB01>rst
 magnitude star, other stars of less brilliancy can be discerned one
 after another by an attentive gazer. Jupiter and Venus were the
 only objects the author had time to identify, but some neighbouring
 observers saw also Castor.
    The most important part of the paper treats of the photographic

  72 -                      Royal Society :—
 -observations. The several preparations are minutely described, and
  drawings, showing the general arrangements of the observatory, are
  given.   In the focus of the secondary magni<U+FB01>er of the Kew helio
  graph, two position-wires, crossing at right angles, are <U+FB01>xed at
  approximately an angle of 45° to a parallel of declination. The
  object-glass has an aperture of 3'4 inches and a focal length of
 50 inches: the primary focal image of the sun at his mean distance
 is 0'47 inch ; but before it is allowed to fall on the sensitive plate, it
 is enlarged to about 3'8 inches by means of an ordinary Huyghenian
 eyepiece. The object-glass is so constructed as to ensure the coin
 cidence of the chemical and visual foci; this coincidence is, however,
 disturbed in a slight degree by the Huyghenian magni<U+FB01>er, which
 renders a slight adjustment necessary. For ordinary sun-pictures,
 and those of the several phases of the eclipse except the totality, the
 aperture was reduced to 2 inehes,—a peculiar instantaneous appara
 tus being employed to regulate the exposure of the sensitive plate.
    The driving-clock of the heliograph was, for convenience, kept
 going during the taking of the partial phaes of the eclipse; but it
 was not really necessary to keep it in motion, because the time of
 exposure certainly did not exceed the 316th of a second.
    The position-wires, by stopping off the sun's light, are depicted in
 the negatives as white lines crossing the solar disk. It was essential,
 in order to turn these several pictures to account, to note exactly the
 time of their being taken, which was done by Mr. Beckley; the click
 ing noise mnde by the instantaneous apparatus, when it struck
 against a stop after releasement, indicating the epoch, which was
 noted to the nearest half-second.     The exact position of the cross
wires was also ascertained by observations of the sun made on each
 side of the meridian; this was necessary, because, in consequence
 of the weather, the pole of the heliograph could be only approxi
mately adjusted in position.
    Upwards of <U+FB01>fty plates were placed in the heliograph between
 llh 28"‘ A.M. and 4“ 16"“ P.)/I. on July 18th; some before the com- I
mencement of the eclipse, and some after. During totality two pho
tographs were obtained. One picture was produced on a plate which
was exposed from the exact commencement of totality during the
minute succeeding this epoch ; the second picture was exposed from
about a minute previous to the reappearance of the sun until not
more than a second before he became visible. In these pictures the
several prominences are depicted with great clearness; and when one
negative is superposed on the other, correspondin parts exactly
coincide. During the taking of the second photograp , an excusable
curiosity on the part of two of the assistants disturbed the telescope
twice, so that the prominences have depicted themselves three times ;
but there was no di<U+FB01>iculty in stopping out the images not belonging
to either of the three phases thus recorded. The author has more-'
over turned this accident to account, and estimated the relative
brightness of the prominences in comparison with the sun’s photo
sphere; and he considers that they are at least 600 times less bril
lisnt than it. This conclusion has been drawn from the minimum

Mr. De la Rue on the Total SolarEclipse of July 18, 1860.          73
time required by the promincnces to depict themselves, which can be
 made out from the photograph in question.
   By means of a new micrometer contrived for that purpose by the
 author, the several photographs have been measured and discussed.
 The position-angles of the line joining the sun’s centre and the
moon’s centre, and the distances of these centres for the several
epochs of the photographs, have been calculated and compared with
the corresponding values calculated by Mr. Farley for the geogra
phical osition of the observatory. Other calculations have also been
made      m the photographs and compared with certain elements of
the eclipse calculated by Mr. Carrington. The results show that the
photographic method of observing solar phenomena is capable of
great exactness.
   The nearest approach of the centres of the sun and moon, as ascer
tained from the photographic measurements, was l1"'8, calculation
giving as a mean l2"'8. The relative diameter of the moon, that of
the sun being taken as unity, as derived from measurements of the
photographs, comes out 10511, which is precisely the theoretical
number; on the other hand, they tend to show that the diameters at
present assumed for the sun and moon, taken conjointly, are about
4"'0 in excess of the truth.
   The paper is accompanied by an extensive series of calculations,
which it is not here necessary to describe.  Those, however, relating
to the measurements of the positions of the luminous prominences
on the two totality-pictures have especial interest. These measure
ments were made in two ways: lst, the original negatives were
measured by the author’s new micrometer; 2nd, enlarged positive
copies were taken on glass, and the contours of the prominences
traced and etched upon the glass, which was afterwards centered on
a dividing engine and divided, the divisions being subsequently
etched. Copper duplicates were then made of the glass plates,
which served to print of? diagrams which accompany the paper.
   Without describing minutely the measurements, it will suffice here
to state that the results go to prove that the luminous prominences
must belong to the sun and not to the moon.         For example, the
change in the angular position of the prominence at a right angle to
the moon’s path, and designated A in the paper, has been calculated
to have been 5° 21' for the assumed geographical position of the _
station; by measurement of the two photographs it is 5° 32'. The
motion of the moon in covering and uncovering a prominence nearly
in the line of her path was calculated to have been 92"'1 ; by mea
surement it was found to have been 93"'0. The accordance of these
numbers is so extremely close, that it would be difficult to obtain
more convincing proofs that the luminous prominences belong to the
sun.

  USE OF THE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES OF THE METRIC SYSTEM
                       IN SCIENTIFIC PURSUITS.
     HE Report of the Committee of the House of Commons on
      Weights and Measures contains decisive evidence on the employ.
ment of the Metric System in chemistry, natural philosophy, and
general science. The examination of Mr. Graham, the Master of
the Mint, is as follows :—
    664. Has your attention been directed to the progress of the de
 cimal and metric system in this country P—lt has lately, with refer
ence to the use of the system in scienti<U+FB01>c papers.
   665. Is not the system attended with great advantages '.'-Yes;
and I may say it has superseded in a great measure the ordinary
system within the last ten years.
   666. Do our chemists continue to make use of the gramme P
Yes, I may say almost exclusively in scienti<U+FB01>c papers.
   667. Have they done that voluntarily ?—Yes.
   668. They have, therefore, done so from a conviction of the advan
cages of the system ?—Yes.
   669. Do you <U+FB01>nd it also an advantage of the metric system, that
its divisions form a sort of common language, better understood by
scienti<U+FB01>c men abroad than the old system P-Yes, that is a very great
recommendation.
   670. Has it ever come to your knowledge that the French, in
consequence of the variation between the English and French systems,
neglect the scienti<U+FB01>c papers which are published in England, in which
our own system of national weights and measures is used ?—That is
certainly the case, and they are frequently not translated, I believe,
on that account.
   671. But still the metric system is <U+FB01>nding its way in every scien
ti<U+FB01>c calculation ?—Yes.
   672. Is it the general opinion of scienti<U+FB01>c men that this is a very
desirable change to be carried into effect ?—As far as my informa
tion goes, it is a very general opinion.
   673. Would you go so far as to say that no scienti<U+FB01>c man thinks
that ultimately any other system is possible ?—I believe that scien
ti<U+FB01>c men who have considered the subject, and who are in the habit
of using the metric system, think so.
   674. Do you observe that the system makes its advance into
popular scienti<U+FB01>c papers which are published?—It is beginning to
<U+FB01>nd a place now in scienti<U+FB01>c elementary works.
   675. In the scienti<U+FB01>c papers which you sometimes write yourself,
do you use it from a conviction of its convenience ?-—Yes.
   676. Is it used in papers read before the Royal Society P—It is.
   67 7. Is it a fact that some years ago its use was objected to by

               Inielligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              75
the Royal Society ?-I cannot say that it was formally objected to,
but it was little used ten or twelve years ago.
   678. Now, on the other hand, is it recommended by the Royal
 Society to be used in papers read before them ?——-Not formally; but
 lbelieve the English system would not form a recommendation to a
 chemical paper.
   681. Have you travelled in France ?----Yes.
    682. Have you ever had occasion to observe whether English
people have great di<U+FB02>iculty in acquiring the French metric system in
 France ?—I think not; in fact I was rather struck with the facility
with which English ladies made use of it in keeping their ac
counts.
    683—4. Do you con<U+FB01>rm the opinion of many other witnesses before
this Committee, that the adoption of the metric system would be a
great international advantage, as well as an advantage for scienti<U+FB01>c
men ?—Yes.
    685. From your position, and the amount of your scienti<U+FB01>c pur
suits, have you had opportunities of observing its progress, and
knowing its value P-Certainly.                           _
    686. Generally, if you were introducing a new system, what unit
of weight would you recommend ?—The gramme.
    687. You would not recommend any of the old systems of weights .7‘
—No.                       .
    688. If you made any change at all, it would be desirable, would
it not, to make such a change as would be a uniform change all over
the world P—Yes.
    The following questions and answers occur in the evidence of
Professor Miller of Cambridge :—
    1489. Do you <U+FB01>nd in your learned pursuits that our present
system of weights and measures interferes with scienti<U+FB01>c investiga
tion in any way ?-—Not in the least; they are so complicated that it
is quite impossible to use them. The balance-makers provide balances
 made for accurate purposes with decimal weights of some kind.
 Mr. Robinson used to provide balances with weights of a grain and
 its decimal subdivisions and multiples. M. CErtling, one of our
 best balance-makers at present, also supplies his balances with
weights on the metric system, with their decimal subdivisions and
 multiples.
     1490. How long has it been the case that the decimal metric
system has been introduced in scienti<U+FB01>c operations P-—As long as I
 can remember : I should think that since 1830 no chemist ever made
 use of any weights which were not decimally divided.
    1493. So far as scienti<U+FB01>c investigations are concerned, our present
 system is useless ?—-Entirely. I believe I do not know the value of
 any of the ordinary subdivisions, the scruple, and the drachm for
 instance.                         _          _        _   _
    1495. Do you think the metric system is extending in this coun

76              I Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
try ?--All chemists use it by preference. If you refer to any of our
scienti<U+FB01>c journals, I think you will observe that weights are almost
invariably given in grammes, and measures in millimetres.
    Since the publication of the above-named Parliamentary Report,
a deputation has been received by the Right Hon. Milner Gibson,
President of the Board of Trade, to enforce the propriety of the
general adoption of the metric system. At this interview, Professor
Owen of the British Museum showed its importance in the study of
natural history. In this science, as he observed, the majority of
the facts include the elements of weight and measure. The evils and
inconveniences of the present state of things were illustrated by such
instances as the following :—
   An English anatomist and physiologist gives the weight of the
brain, lungs, &c. in relation to the weight of the body, of some rare
animal. The foreign physiologist desires to reduce the English
weights to those of his own country. If the kind of weight used by the
Englishman be not speci<U+FB01>ed, viz. avoirdupois or troy, the description
is useless to the foreigner in regard to the important constants of
the proportion of parts or organs to the whole body.
   Whilst British observers vary even in the use of weights legalized
in their own country, our present systems of measures of capacity
make it still more di<U+FB01>icult to impart to foreign savans the results of
our observations.
   As to linear admeasurements, a foreigner has generally some mis
giving whether the British naturalists, in describing lengths by
“ lines," mean the twelfth or the tenth part of the English inch. The
most careful describers feel themselves, therefore, compelled, for the
sake of their continental fellow-labourers, to make use of two systems
of notation ; and I have for some time used the French decimal
system, appending the dimensions, in parts of the metre, to the de
nominations of the English system. A foot-rule, with the divisions
of the metre on one side, is now indispensable for associated labours
of observation in regard to constants of linear admeasurement.
   Although, when the system of weight or measure is noted by the
observer, its reduction, or the <U+FB01>nding of the equivalent in another
system, is a small demand upon time, yet the repetition of that act
takes a serious amount from the working-hours of the individual;
and when multiplied by the number of observers obstructed by con
<U+FB02>icting systems of weights and measures, the impediment to the
progress of the sciences of observation become so great as to render
the subject quite worthy of the consideration of legislative authority.
EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT:
   DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS.           BY M. LEON FOUCAULT.
   Spite of restricted space and of the want of <U+FB01>gures, I shall try
to describe the principal parts of the apparatus which has yielded a

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                77
value for the velocity of. light so different from that which has
hitherto been accepted in science.
   It consists of a micrometric sight cut in a plate of silvered glass :
 a rotating mirror supported on the axis of a small air turbine; a
 bellows with constant pressure; an achromatic objective; a series
 of an odd number of concave spherical mirrors of silvered glass ; a
 mirror inclined at partial re<U+FB02>exion; a micrometric microscope; and a
 circular screen in the form of a toothed wheel set in motion by a
 chronometric wheelwork. I shall <U+FB01>rst describe the apparatus at rest.
    A beam of solar light, re<U+FB02>ected horizontally by a heliostat, falls
 on the micrometric sight, which consists of a series of vertical lines at
 a distance of     millim. from each other. This sight, which in the
 experiment is the real standard of measure, has been divided with
 great care by M. Froment. The rays which have traversed this
 plane, impinge at a distance of a metre on a plane rotating mirror,
 where they undergo a <U+FB01>rst re<U+FB02>exion, which sends them towards a
 <U+FB01>rst concave mirror at a distance of 44 metres. Between these two
mirrors, and as near the plane mirror as possible, the object-glass is
placed, having on the one side the virtual image of the sight, and on
 the other the concave mirror with its two conjugate foci. These
conditions being ful<U+FB01>lled, the beam of light, after having traversed
the object-glass, forms an image of the sight on the surface of this
<U+FB01>rst concave mirror.
   Hence the beam is re<U+FB02>ected a second time in a direction so oblique
that it avoids the apparatus of the rotating mirror, the image of which
it forms in space at a certain distance. At the place at which this
image is produced a second concave mirror is placed, arranged so that
the pencil, once more re<U+FB02>ected, passes near the <U+FB01>rst spherical mirror,
forming a second image of the sight; this is taken up by a third con
cave surface, and so on, until the last image of the sight is formed at
the surface of a last concave mirror of an odd number. I have been
able thus to employ as many as <U+FB01>ve mirrors, which develope a line
 20 metres in length. The last of these mirrors is at a distance
of 4rmetres from the last but one, which faces it, a distance equal
to its radius of curvature ; and it re<U+FB02>ects the image on its own
path, a condition which is exactly ful<U+FB01>lled by superposing on the
 surface of the opposite mirror the emergent image with the return
image; that being effected, it is certain that the pencil reascends
the series, repasses by the plane mirror of the rotatory apparatus, and
that, <U+FB01>nally, all the rays re-emerge by the sight, point by point, as
they entered. This fact of the return of the rays may be con<U+FB01>rmed,
and an accessible image procured by turning, by partial re<U+FB02>cxion,
on the surface of a mirror inclined at 45°, a portion of the pencil
which is examined with a feeble microscope.        This latter, which in
all respects resembles the micrometric microscopes in use for astro
 nomical observation, forms with the sight and the inclined mirror a
 very stable solid whole.
    In the apparatus thus described, the real image sent to the micro
scope and formed by return rays partially re<U+FB02>ected, occupies a

 7.81            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 de<U+FB01>nite position in reference to the mirror and to the sight itself.
 This position is precisely that of the virtual image of the sight, seen
 by re<U+FB02>exion in the plane of the mirror.       This, at any rate, is what
 occurs when the apparatus is at rest.
     But when the plane mirror rotates, this image changes its place,
 seeing that during the time in which the light takes to traverse twice
 the broken line of the concave mirrors, the rotating mirror continues
 to rotate, and that the rays, on their return, do not meet it under
 the same incidence as at the moment of arrival. It follows that the
 image is displaced in the direction of the rotation, and this displace
 ment increases with the velocity of the rotation; it also manifestly
 increases with the length of the path, and with the distance which
 separates the sight from the rotating mirror. The manner in which
 these various quantities aifect the experiment as well as the velocity
 of light itself, are expressed by a very simple formula, which has
 been already established, and which I shall only have to recall here.
     Calling V the velocity of the light, n the number of turns of the
 mirror in a second, 1 the length of the broken line comprised
 between the rotating mirror and the last concave mirror, 0* the
 distance of the sight from the rotating mirror, and d the observed
 displacement, we get, by considering the structure of the apparatus,
                                    81rnlr
                                V-_   d ,
an expression which gives the velocity of light by means of quan
tities which must be separately measured.
    The distances Z and 1* are measured directly by a. rule, or by a
paper band, which is then referred to the unit of length. The dis
placement may be observed micrometrically; it remains to be shown
how the number of turns (n) is estimated which the mirror makes in
a second.
    Let us <U+FB01>rst describe how a constant velocity is imparted to the
mirror.
    This mirror of silvered glass, 14 rnillims. in diameter, is mounted
directly on the axis of a small air turbine of known construction,
admirably executed by M. Froment. The air is furnished by a high
pressure bellows made by M. Gavaille-Coll, who has justly acquired
a high reputation in the manufacture of large organs. As it is im
portant that the pressure be very constant, the air on emerging from
the bellows traverses a regulator, recently devised by M. Cavaille,
and in which the pressure of a column of water of 30 centimetres
does not vary § a millimetre. Hence the <U+FB02>uid emerging from the
ori<U+FB01>ces of the turbine represents a remarkably constant motive
power. "On the other hand, the mirror, in accelerating, meets with
a resistance in the surrounding air, which for a given velocity is
also perfectly constant. Hence the moveable body placed between
these two constant forces cannot fail to assume and retain a uni
form velocity. Any stop acting on the <U+FB02>ow of air renders it pos
sible to regulate this velocity within very narrow limits.

                {Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            79
     It remained, <U+FB01>nally, to count the number of turns, or rather to
 impart to the moveable body a determinate velocity.      This problem
  was completely solved in the following manner :
     Between the microscope and the mirror for partial re<U+FB02>exion is
  placed a circular disc, whose <U+FB01>nely-toothed edge encroaches upon
  the image observed, and partially cuts it off. The disc rotates uni
  formly on itself so that, if the image shone in a continuous manner,
  the teeth which it carries on its circumference would escape from
  sight by the rapidity of its motion. But the image is not perma
  nent, it arises from a series of discontinuous appearances, which are
  equal in number to that of the revolutions of the mirror; and in the
  particular case in which the teeth of the screen also succeed in the
  same number, an easily explicable optical illusion is produced, which
  makes the teething appear as if the disc had no existence. Let us
  suppose, then, that this disc, carrying n teeth on its circumference,
  makes one turn in a second, and at the same time the turbine is
  started; if, in regulating the <U+FB02>ow of the motive air, the apparent
 <U+FB01>xity of the teeth can be maintained, it is certain that the mirror
 makes exactly 01. turns in a second.
    M. Frornent, who had made the turbine, has been good enough to
 devise and construct a chronometric wheelwork to make the disc move;
 it is a very remarkable piece of clockwork, which solves in an
 elegant manner the problem of uniform motion in the particular case
 in which there is no work to perform.       The success is so complete,
 thatl am daily in the habit of starting the mirror at 400 turns in a
 second, and of seeing the two apparatus work to almost 1050“ for
 entire minutes.                                                       -
    Yet, although I had obtained all certainty with regard to th
measurement of the time, I was surprised at <U+FB01>nding in my results dis
accordances which were not in any ratio with the precision of the
means of measurement._ After long research, I ultimately found
that the source of error lay in the micrometer, which is by no means so
accurate as is usually thought. To obviate this dif<U+FB01>culty, I introduced
into the system of observation a modi<U+FB01>cation which ultimately comes
to a simple change in the variable. Instead of measuring the de
viation micrometrically, I adopt for it a value de<U+FB01>ned beforehand,
either 775 of a millimetre, or 7 entire parts of the image, and I try,
experimentally, what distance there must be between the sight and
the rotating mirror to produce this deviation : as the measures refer
then to a length of about a metre, the last fractions still retain a
 directly visible magnitude and leave no room for error.
    By this means the apparatus has been freed from the principal
 source of uncertainty. Since then, the results agree within the limits
 of the errors of observation, and the means are so <U+FB01>xed that I have
  been able to give con<U+FB01>dently the new number which it appears to
  me expresses very nearly the velocity of light in space; that is to
  say, 298,000 kilometres (l90‘249' 16 miles) in a second of mean time.

 PHENOMENA OF TRANSPORT THROUGH POROUS BODIES! APPLI
  CATION TO DIRECT ANALYSIS: DIALYSIS.              BY M. ERN. GUINET.
    After a very brief analysis of Mr. Graham's researches, the author
 proceeds as follows :
    Having experienced certain di<U+FB01>iculties in the use of vegetable
 parchment, I endeavoured to replace the dialyser by a porous vessel
 of pipeclay, such as are used for batteries, instead of which it
 would be better to use shallow vessels. I have repeated most'0f
 Mr. Graham's principal experiments, and have made some which
 appeared impossible with vegetable parchment.
   The following are some of them :—
    Solution of gum and sugar, in which is immersed a porous vessel
 containing pure water. At the expiration of twenty-four hours a
 great part of the sugar has traversed the porous vessel, and is dis
 solved in the water, which does not contain a trace of gum.
   Solution of caramel and ofbichromate of potass. The salt traverses
 the porous vessel alone; the separation is speedily effected. If a
 drop of the mixed solutions is allowed to fall on a porous vessel, a
 brown spot of caramel is obtained, surrounded by a yellow one of
bichromate, which shows the more rapid ditfusion of the latter .
salt.
   Cotton dissolved in ammoniacal solution of copper. The water in
the porous vessel becomes blue from dissolving ammoniacal oxide of
copper; the cotton remains on the outside. The evident object of
this experiment is to get the cotton in a soluble modi<U+FB01>cation; but
as ammoniacal oxide of copper diffuses slowly, I must wait a month
to obtain a result. It is clear that this experiment could not be
made with vegetable parchment, which is acted on by the ammo
niacal copper solvent.
   Experiments were made in which water, was replaced by other
liquids, such as bisulphide of carbon and oil of turpentine.
   The dilfusibility of different crystalloids in bisulphide of carbon is
by no means the same in all cases.         Thus, if iodine, sulphur, and
naphthaline are dissolved in bisulphide, the two latter pass into a
porous vessel full of pure bisulphide much sooner than the former.
   If it might be permitted to venture an explanation of the unex
pected phenomena discovered by Mr. Graham, it might be said that
parchment~paper or porous vessels act as a kind of sieve, through
which the more attenuated molecules pass more readily; for the
colloids have generally a high equivalent and a considerable atomic
volume. The opposite is the case with crystalloids; and the less
di<U+FB02>hsible of the crystalloids are those which correspond to the greatest
atomic volume (taking for this the quotient of the atomic weight by
the density, which cannot be exact). Such is iodine, which is less
dilfusible than sulphur.--—C'0mptes Rendus, Nov. 10, 1862.

    XII. On the Formation ofAlpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.
              By JonN BALL, M.R.I.A., F.L.S. é§'c.*
  EVERY one who feels an interest in the past history of the
        Alps must be glad to <U+FB01>nd renewed attention given to the
 natural agencies that have given that region its existing confor
 mation. Many persons will therefore have read with satisfac
 tion the papers recently published by Professor Ramsay, the
 President of the Geological Society, in the Quarterly Journal of
 that Society for August 1862, and by Professor Tyndall in the
 Philosophical Magazine for the following month. To these
 should, perhaps, be added some important observations con
 tained in an address delivered at the recent Meeting of the
 British Association, by Mr. Beete Jukes, the President of the
 Geological Section. In these publications by eminent English
men of science, the views of preceding alpine geologists, such
as Charles Martins, Gastaldi, and Omboni, which have been ably
summed up and extended in some recent memoirs by M. Mortillet,
have received a still wider extension, and we are called upon to
enlarge very much our previous conceptions as to the agency of
those great glaciers which, at a period geologically very recent,
descended from the <U+FB02>anks of the higher Alps to the level of the
plains.
    If controversies in science were decided by the authority of
eminent names, or if the discussion of the problems raised by
these papers required a complete acquaintance with the whole
<U+FB01>eld of physics and geology, I should certainly not enter the
lists against such formidable opponents. The problems in ques.
 tion, however, occupy a limited <U+FB01>eld in the region which is

82                Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
common alike to physics and to geology; their solution depends
in a great part upon facts which must be studied on the ground;
and I am thus led to hope that a omewhat long and extensive
acquaintance with the Alps, during which the questions at issue
have been very frequently the subject of my thoughts, may
authorize me without presumption to take a share in the discus
sion. Writing at a distance from England, and with but slight
opportunities for knowing what is passing elsewhere, I shall be
forgiven if I repeat objections previously urged by others, or
advance arguments that have been already satisfactorily answered.
   Professor Ramsay attributes to the action of glacier-ice the
hollowing out of lake-basins in the Alps and elsewhere; Pro
fessor Tyndall sees in the same powerful agent the main, if not
the exclusive, means for the formation of alpine valleys. An
anonymous writer, in terms which show that his knowledge of
the subject is on a par with his good taste, has confounded
together the scope of the two papers. I hope to show not only
that the problems attempted to be solved by their writers are
‘different, but, furthermore, that the main objections to each
solution rest upon considerations entirely distinct.
   Taking, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, the larger of the two questions
-raised for discussion, I shall inquire whether there is reason to
admit Professor Tyndall’s conclusion, drawn chie<U+FB02>y from his
observations in the neighbourhood of Monte Rosa, that the
valleys of the Alps have, as a general rule, been scooped out by
great glaciers from the <U+FB02>anks of previously continuous mountain
masses.                                                            -
   The <U+FB01>rst thought of any one considering this question is to
endeavour to take a comprehensive view of the present con<U+FB01>gu
ration of the surface. If the reader will look at any general map
of the Swiss and Savoy Alps, he will in the <U+FB01>rst place observe
that between the higher central ranges and the plains of France
there is interposed a zone of secondary rocks, elevated into ridges
from 4000 to 6000 feet above the sea-level. In carrying his eye
along this zone from the neighbourhood of Grenoble to that of
Aaron, he will see that the direction of the ridges, which is at
<U+FB01>rst nearly north and south, is gradually bent towards the east,
so that the principal chain of the Jura points from N.E. by E.
to S.VV. by W. He will further observe that the chain nowhere
consists of a single ridge, .but of three, four, or <U+FB01>ve parallel
ridges with furrow-like valleys lying between them, here and
there cut through by some stream that appears to flow through
afracture that has traversed the entire range. Including along
with the Jura the ranges of Western Dauphiné, the Vosges
Mountains, and the somewhat higher ridges west of the valley
of the Arty, it will be apparent that the arguments of Professor

                     Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.                 83
    Tyndall cannot possibly apply to a system of valleys which are,
    without exception, parallel to the highest ridges, and where, if
   the present inequalities were <U+FB01>lled up, and the whole mass
   covered with ice, the new glaciers, supposing them competent to
   form valleys, would certainlyvshape them at right angles to their
   present direction.
      If he neglect these outlying ranges for a moment, and direct
   his attention to the central region of the Alps, the observer will
   scarcely fail to note, as one of the most characteristic features of
   the Swiss Alps, the line of valley which extends for nearly 140
   miles from Martigny to Coire. With one slight distortion, the
   Rhone <U+FB02>ows directly from E.N.E. to W.S.W. between the
   Furka Pass and Martigny. On the opposite side of that low
  pass, the line of valley descending to Andermatt preserves exactly
  the same direction. The famous gorge of the Devil’s Bridge
  allows the Reuss to carry off towards the north the drainage of
  the valley, but the main line of depression keeps true to its
  Original direction through the glen that mounts to the Oberalp
  Pass; and east of that ridge the same direction is so accurately
  preserved, that a line drawn from Chiamct (the highest hamlet)
  to Coire is nowhere half a mile from the present bed of the
  Vorder Rhine. Another of the main valleys of the Alps, that
  of the Inn, is nearly exactly parallel to the standard line which
  we have traced across Switzerland. From Kufstein, where the
  railway enters the Tyrol, the valley of the Inn, with a slight
  distortion between Innsbruck and Ried, maintains a constant .di
  rection up to its head at the lake of Sils ; but a traveller following
  steadily the same course <U+FB01>nds the pass of the Maloja west of the
 lake very little raised above the level of the valleys on either
 side, and leading through the Val Bregaglia to Chiavenna, from
 whence, if he will keep on W.S.W. across the ridge that sepa
 rates him ,from Roveredo, he will enter another line of valley
 that is continuous with the upper end of the Lago Maggiore,
 and may even be traced through the Val Vegezzo and the Val
 Anzasca to the foot of Monte Rosa. It is sn<U+FB01>icient to carry the
 eye across the map, to perceive how very generally the same
 direction prevails among the valleys of the central region of the
 Alps, and that, as in the instances above quoted, these lines of
 depression traverse a ridge, or contain streams that <U+FB02>ow in oppo
 site directions-—.sh0wing that by no conceivable change in the
general conformation of the land could a single stream or glacier
have done the work. The line of valley, in great part occupied
-by lakes, that stretches from Interlaken to Kussnach on the Lake
of Lucerne, the system of valleys between the Lake of Thun and
the Rhone, the Val Pellina, the Le): Blanche or Allée Blanche,
and the Valley of Chamonni, are so many instances in point,

84               Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
and, when taken together, bring to my mind the conviction that
some considerable portion at least of the existing valleys in the
Alps owe their origin to forces which have operated on a great
scale, and which can scarcely be any other than those that have
raised the mountain ridges to which'the same valleys are related.
If it be urged that several of the valleys to which I have referred
lie along the line of outcrop of softer and more easily disinte
grated rocks, such as certain slates in the valley of the Rhone,
and that the action of either water or ice would for that reason
be more effective in scooping out the valley where we now see it,
I may reply that the very fact alleged shows the working of
denudation along the same line at some early period in the
history of the elevation of the Alps, and the strong probability
of the existence at the same period of a corresponding valley.
   If we now pass from the contemplation of a wide tract of
mountain country to the examination of particular groups or
masszfs, we very frequently <U+FB01>nd indications of the prevalence of
a common direction in the secondary ridges and valleys, trans
verse, but seldom exactly perpendicular, to that of the main
valleys. Thus in the Bernese and Lepontine Alps we <U+FB01>nd the
ridges enclosing the two main branches of the Aar Glacier, those
on either side of the Geren Thal, the Val Leventino between
Airolo and Faido, and several minor valleys, all showing a
degree of parallelism which points to the operation of some
common cause. The series of seven minor valleys lying about
due east and west between the Val Maggia and that of the Tosa
is perhaps a better illustration, as there is nothing in the gene
ral con<U+FB01>guration of the district to make it conceivable that, if
the hollows were <U+FB01>lled up, water or ice would reopen trenches
where the present valleys exist. The four or <U+FB01>ve great ridges
extending northwards from the range of Monte Rosa towards
the valley of the Rhone furnish, as I believe, another illustration
of the same tendency to the formation of groups of parallel
valleys.
    The facts hitherto adduced seem to me to point very strongly
to the conclusion that mechanical forces, acting on a large scale
and in de<U+FB01>nite directions, have had at the least a considerable
 share in the formation of alpine valleys. For reasons to which
I shall further advert, it appears most probable that complicated
forces acting on the mountain masses have given rise to many
valleys whose direction gives no clue, or nonethat has yet been
traced, to their origin ; but I am quite ready to admit that the
present condition of the surface cannot readily be explained with
out very largely admitting the action of water, whether in the
liquid or solid form.   To study the various agencies that, some
times working together, sometimes in alternation, have given to

                  Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.              85
the alpine world its present form and aspect, to attribute to
each its own share, and to find fair evidence in support of his
 conclusions, is the formidably dif<U+FB01>cult task of the alpine geolo
 gist; and even if he be fortunate enough to gain the help of the
 ablest workers in the <U+FB01>eld of physical science, it will be long
 before that task can approach to a conclusion. In considering
 whether or no it is probable that the agent which has excavated
 valleys whose vertical depth below the ridges that enclose them
 often exceeds an English mile, and in two of the valleys referred
 to by Professor Tyndall is at least a mile and a half, the <U+FB01>rst
 step is to examine the mode of action of existing glaciers.
    The whole mechanical effect of a glacier upon its bed is
 directed towards the removal of inequalities, whether in the bot
 tom or sides. It is quite understating the case, to say that if
 valleys were excavated by ice through strata at all approaching
 to uniform hardness, they would all tend to the same type of
 equal slope in the bed, and absence of projecting masses ill the
containing walls, of which the valley of the Rhone between Mar
tigny and Sion gives the best known example. Any one who
has watched the manner in which the bottom of a glacier slides
over the concavities without touching them, and applies all its
immense grinding power to the convex portions of its bed, will
admit that a great degree of inequality in the resistance of dif
ferent portions of the rock would not prevent a valley scooped
out exclusively by glacier-action from approaching nearly to the
same uniform model. Fortunately for the lover of natural
scenery, the fact is widely different from what it would be if the
theory were generally well founded. The most common type of
an alpine valley is that which is formed by a succession of level
basins rising in steps one above the other as they approach the
head of the valley, and connected by gorges whose opposite sides
often approach near together, and which are always much nar
rower than the basins that they link together. There is often
distinct evidence, and usually good reason to suspect, that these
basins were originally lakes; and in the walls of the gorges in
termediate it is common to see proof that at some former period
the depth of these lakes must have been greatly increased by
barriers of rock, that once held them in and at a later period
were cut through by streams of ice or water. I do not pretend
that the type of valley above described is universal; but it is
too common, both in the Alps and other mountain countries, not
to present a formidable difficulty in the way of Professor Tyn
dall’s bold hypothesis.      Even though 1 should admit, as I
cannot do, that such lakes as still exist, or have existed, could
be formed by a glacier, the existence of a succession of such ap
proximately level steps, separated by steep slopes and narrow

86                 Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
gorges, is to me a conclusive proof that some agency other than
that of ice must have directed the original formation of valleys
of this type. In one respect the inequalities of the sides of
alpine valleys offer a stronger argument against their glacial
origin than those of their bed. The surface of the ice, even near
the side of the glacier, moves much faster than the part in con
tact with its bed; and it suf<U+FB01>ces to cut away the foundation of a
lofty cliff at the point where the glacier abuts against its base, to
determine its fall. Looking at the operation as a whole, it is to
me quite inconceivable that a glacier should be competent to
scoop out valleys a. mile or more in depth, and yet be unable to
remove the main inequalities from its own channel.
    A comparison of the effects of existing glaciers with those of
the present torrents must lead many observers besides Professor
Tyndall to the conclusion that the former are far -more powerful
 excavators than the latter, but do not to my mind justify the
 inference that no assignable limit can be placed to the work
 which they have actually accomplished. Vast as the period
 may be during which glaciers occupied many of the valleys of
 the Alps, it was not long enough to enable them to accomplish
 more than a certain de<U+FB01>nite amount of excavation ; and I think
 it likely that the amount may hereafter be determined with some
 degree of accuracy. Indications are not wanting both of what
 glaciers have achieved, and of what they have failed to achieve.
 Ever since the range of Mont Blanc assumed its present form,
before the so-called glacial epoch, and during that long period,
and ever since down to the present hour, the snow that accumu
lates in the basin of the Mer de Glace has been discharged into
 the valley of Chamouni by the ice-fall of the Glacier des Bois.
 During the whole of that immense period, the uttermost mecha
nical effect of the glacier upon its bed has been applied to grind
 down the ledge over which it has to <U+FB02>ow, and to bring the chan
 nel to a uniform slope. It is impossible to doubt that a consi
derable effect has been produced; the ledge has been lowered
 perhaps by 1000 feet, possibly more; the angle which the slope
 of the ice-fall makes with the glacier above has been rendered
much more obtuse; but still the ice-fall remains, and the bed of
the glacier has not been ground down to the uniform slope.
     I refer to a well-known glacier, familiar to many readers,
 though I can conceive a partial, but, I think, an insufficient
 answer to my argument, founded on local conditions, and not on
 general grounds. I could easily cite many similar instances
 which would be less open to cavil. The same argument, mutatis
 mutandis, might be applied to lateral obstacles, such as the rocks
 known as l’Angle on the west side of the same glacier.
    It is impossible to leave this part of the subject without some

                     Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.              87:»
    brief reference to the ingenious suggestion of Professor Tyndall,
     who perceives in the operations of the glaciers upon the rocky
    framework of the Alps, not merely the agent that has hollowed
     out the existing valleys, but one competent, by its destructive
    power, to bring about the change from the present climate of the
    Alps to that which prevailed when the glaciers descended to the
    plains. If I could have the pleasure of standing beside him on
    the Superga, or any other central position from whence he could
    survey the outline of the main chain of the Cottian and Pennine
    Alps, serrated with peaks and intervening depressions, I would
    beg of -Professor Tyndall to consider in detail whether, and by
    what means, glaciers, however extensive, or endowed with what
    ever mechanical power, could have determined the form of the
   topmost crest of that great range, or can hereafter reduce it
   below its present level. It will certainly not escape him that the
   grinding power of ice is exerted to an appreciable extent only by
   considerable ice-streams <U+FB02>owing through de<U+FB01>ned channels, when
   they have reached the level at which the temperature of the whole
   mass is brought near to the melting-point, and that the snow
  and ice which cover the highest parts of the Alps, so far from
  tending to hasten their downfall, act as a protection from other
  agents of destruction; so that in truth no rocks, except those at
  aconsiderable depth below the surface of the sea, are so little
  exposed to degradation as the tops of high snowy mountains.
  Whatever effect glaciers have produced in reducing their own
  limits, must have been e<U+FB01>fected, not by lowering the general level
 of the ridges of the Alps, but by deepening the hollows, and
  un<U+FB01>tting some portions of the area from serving as reservoirs for
 the accumulation of snow. Professor Tyndall, if I may venture
 to say so, has thrown additional light on the recent history of
 the Alps and other high mountain countries by directing atten
 tion to one of the causes that must have contributed to reduce
 within narrower limits the action of glaciers, but has not gone
 near to proving that the deepening of the main channels suffices,
 without other climatal changes, to account for the disappearance
of glaciers that formerly reached to the level of the plains of
Piedmont and Lombardy, to a distance of 30, 4-0, and even 80
miles from the limits of the existing ice-streams.
     I pass over many facts of secondary importance which seem to
me to con<U+FB01>rm the views above advocated, merely glancing at one
which is familiar to most persons who have studied the working
of the ancient glaciers of the Alps—the record, namely, which
is preserved by the harder rocks of the former limits of glacier
action. In scanning the rocky sides of the higher alpine valleys,
the contrast between the surfaces that have once been subject to
the passage of a glacier, and those that were not reached even by

88                Mr. J. Ball on the Formation
the highest level of the ancient ice-<U+FB02>ood, has struck every observer.
Where the rock is hard enough to resist subsequent degradation,
the eye follows the track of the former glacier as easily as it
traces high-water mark by the fringe of sea-weed on the shore;
and if this mark avails as positive evidence of the former exten
sion of glacier action, it is not less a negative proof that that
action did not surpass certain assignable limits.
    I shall now offer some brief remarks upon Professor Ramsay’s
theory of the origin of alpine lakes. Although Ml Mortillet
had anticipated Professor Ramsay in attributing the formation
of the lakes of Lombardy to the action of ancient glaciers, his
speculations on the subject are far more guarded, and at the
same time fall short of the generality which marks those of the
eminent British geologist; it is to the latter, therefore, that I
shall in the <U+FB01>rst place address myself.
    Professor Ramsa_v’s argument may be summarily stated in a
few words. Each of the great alpine lakes lies in an area once
covered by glacier; no satisfactory explanation of the origin of
alpine lakes has yet been given; the glacier considered as a
mechanical agent is competent to scoop out the rock basins in
which the alpine lakes generally lie; therefore, the lakes have
been formed by glaciers.
    The <U+FB01>rst of these propositions, even though it be admitted
with some reserve, does not hold inversely, as it should do if the
scooping out of rock basins were one of the natural functions
of glaciers. Why should not the glacier that <U+FB02>owed from Susa
to beyond Turin, or the still vaster mass that descended from
the Val d’A0sta, excavate a basin as deep and large as the Lago
 Maggiore or the Lake of Como '? Why throughout the Dauphiné
Alps, or the far more extensive region of the Tyrolese, Salzburg,
 Carinthian and Styrian Alps, are no lakes found in the path of
the great extinct glaciers? Again, in admitting the proposition
 in its direct form, it is necessary to draw a marked distinction
 between the assertion that the existing lakes lie within an area
 once covered by glacier, and the fact that some of them lie in
valleys which once gave passage to the main stream of an extinct
 glacier.   Even though the efficiency of the glacier as an exca
 vating tool were demonstrated, instead of being, as I feel sure,
 capable of disproof, it is not easy to conceive how it could have
 been applied to the hollowing out of such basins as the Lake of
 Lugano or the Lake of Zug. The mountain-valleys that are
 drained into the former lake are of the most tri<U+FB02>ing dimensions,
and their height relatively insigni<U+FB01>cant. The main supply of
 ice to the basin of the lake was, on the one hand, from the glacier
 of the Adda, then occupying the site of the Lake of Como, across
 the ridge between Menaggio and Porlezza, and, on the other,

                   Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.                89
  from the glacier of the Tessior over the pass of Monte Cenere.
  The relatively slender streams which <U+FB02>owed over these barriers
  might sul<U+FB01>ce under given climatal conditions to <U+FB01>ll the lake
  basin with ice, which would spread, as really occurred, beyond
  its present limits ; but the result must have been to produce an
  ice lake rather than an ice river; and the boldest speculator in
  glacial theories must hesitate to assert that any agency was there
  present that could even tend to excavate a trench which, according
  to the latest measures, is 919 feet below the present level of the
  lake.
      The difficulty of applying this theory, even if it were other
  wise tenable, to such a lake as that of Zug, 1279 feet in depth,
  or to others that might be cited, need not be discussed in detail.
  The facts simply show that water, whether in the solid or liquid
  state, tends, under the action of gravity, to seek the lowest level.
     With reference to that part of Professor Ramsay’s memoir
  which tends to clear the way for the admission of glacier-action
  by denying the validity of other explanations of the origin of
  lakes, it would be rash in me to enter into controversy with so
 accomplished a geologist; yet I own to the belief that the causes
  may be various, and that, until we have acquired more accurate
 knowledge of the processes by which mountain chains have been
 uplifted, it is premature to declare ourselves incompetent to
  explain the depressions of the surface with which the mountain
 ridges are correlated. In any case we are not entitled to argue
 from our own ignorance to the admission of a new agent, until
 its competency shall be proved by direct evidence.
     I am thus led to examine the point upon which the new theory
 really turns, and which, as it seems to me, has been taken for
 granted rather than cautiously investigated. The assumption,
which is common to Professor Ramsay and to M. Mortillet,
that the excavating power of a glacier in hollowing out a plain
surface, or in deepening an existing basin, is proportioned to the
weight of the mass pressing on its bed, seems to me to rest upon
a super<U+FB01>cial view of the mechanical conditions of glacier-motion.
It has long been demonstrated that, even when lying on a slope
considerably inclined, the friction of the rocky bed against the
under surface of the glacier suffices to retard the motion of the
lower portion of the ice-stream so that this bears but a small
ratio to the velocity of the upper surface. It is impossible to
doubt that this retardation would be increased very largely in
the case of a glacier lying upon a level though irregular surface,
though, if this were of slight extent, the weight and momentum
of the glacier behind might impress upon it some slight pro
gressive movement. But if we suppose a glacier of great thick
ness to lie on a level surface many miles in extent, it is easy to

 9O                Mr. J. Ball on the Furmation'of
 see that the movement of the lower surface of the ice would be
 completely stopped, and that the onward movement would be
effected by the <U+FB02>owing of the upper over the lower portions of
the mass. It is forgotten that the resistance offered by friction
would be increased to an almost in<U+FB01>nite extent, while the resist
 ance of the substance of the glacier to internal rearrangement
 is con<U+FB01>ned within moderate limits. M. Mortillet has estimated
that the pressure of the ice upon the bed of certain ancient
glaciers occupying lake-basins must have reached 300 and even
500 tons per square metre; but if this pressure were even ten
times as great, the effect would only more certainly have been
to force the ice of the lower surface into every inequality of the
bed, and to make the resistance to onward movement more and
more insuperable. When the front of the glacier is supposed to
move up a slope, as in Mr. Ramsay’s diagram of the Lake of
Geneva, the above reasoning applies zit fortiori. If, on further
consideration, Professor Ramsay should feel doubtful on this
point, I would urge him to make direct observations, which may
tend to satisfy his own mind, and that of others who may natu
rally be swayed by his authority. It is not easy to <U+FB01>nd the
conditions under which such observations could most usefully
be attempted; but the glacier of La Brenva, and some others
where the ice impinges against <U+FB01>xed obstacles, may furnish matter
of instruction.
    It will be obvious to the reader, that the question here dis
cussed has a considerable bearing upon Professor Tyndall’s
views of the formation of valleys. The reason why the action
of a glacier is more limited than appears probable to one who
considers the enormous mechanical power developed in its pro
gress, is because the greater part of that power is expended in
overcoming the resistance of the mass to internal rearrangement,
and a small portion only is applied to the onward motion of its
lower surface, by which alone any mechanical effect is produced
on the subjacent rocks.
    If it should not appear super<U+FB02>uous to discuss at greater
length the mechanical question involved in Mr. Ramsay’s theory,
I might ask how we are to believe that the glacier of the Rhone,
after it had <U+FB02>owed out of its native valley, when, being no
longer con<U+FB01>ned within a de<U+FB01>ned channel, it had covered with
ice the plain of Switzerland as far as the Jura, was yet able
to excavate a rock basin 50 miles and more in length, 12
miles broad, and nearly 1000 feet deep, while at the point
where its mechanical power was at its maximum, in the de<U+FB01>le
of St. Maurice, it has failed to cut through rocks of no extreme
hardness a more spacious opening than that which the traveller
still sees between Bex and Martigny. It is a complete under

                  Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.               91
 estimate, to assert that the glacier must have moved through
 that de<U+FB01>le at a pace twenty times greater than its rate of motion
 anywhere over the level of the lake; yet we see how limited its
 e<U+FB02>ect has been upon the containing walls of the valley.
     A very interesting paper by M. Mortillet, referred to by Pro
  fessor Ramsay, but not as generally known as it should be in
  England, is mainly devoted to prove that the lakes of Lombardy
  must have at one time been <U+FB01>lled up by the post-pleiocene dilu
  vium, which forms so important a deposit throughout the entire
  valley of the Po, and that they have been cleared out by the
  glaciers which descended into them during the subsequent
  glacial epoch. M. Mortillet is careful to admit that against
  solid rock the glacier would be comparatively inoperative, but
  he assumes rather than seeks to prove that the case would be
  di<U+FB02>"erent in regard to the incoherent masses of rolled pebbles,
  sand, &c. which make up the diluvium.         M. Mortillet is a
  shrewd reasoner, and he has made out a good primd facie case
  for his hypothesis, which does not present such formidable diffi
  culties as that of Professor Ramsay; but I own myself to be
  sceptical as to the possibility of a glacier under the supposed
  circumstances excavating, even in yielding materials, trough
  like basins which vary in depth from 900 to 2600 feet. I feel
  convinced that the whole effective work must have been accom
  plished during the advance of the glacier by the front of the ice,
  which might probably, to a limited extent, have ploughed out a
  furrow in soft materials ; but from the moment when any portion
  of the diluvium became covered over by the glacier, the enormou
  weight of the ice would tend to consolidate it, and, for the rea
  sons already given, the grinding action produced by the advance
  of the lower surface of the ice over its bed would disappear, or
  be reduced within very narrow limits.
     An additional di<U+FB02>iculty, fatal, as I think, to Professor Ram
 say’s theory, and hard to reconcile with that of M. Mortillet,
  arises from the presence in most alpine lakes of projecting
 points of rock, and sometimes of rocky bays and‘ coves facing
 in the direction towards which the glacier formerly <U+FB02>owed. An
 instance which may be familiar to some readers is the rocky
 promontory, extending into the Lake of Como, south of Tremezzo,
 whereon stands the Villa Arconati. The glacier, whatever its
 ef<U+FB01>cacy as a tool may have been, worked in one direction only,
 and cannot have scooped out hollows in a direction contrary to
its own current. Such irregularities as I speak of cannot be
accounted for on Professor Ramsay’s theory ; and according to
M. Mortillet we should expect to <U+FB01>nd them at least partially
blocked up by diluvium, remaining in situ in those places where
it had not lain in the path of the glacier stream.

 92                Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
    The vast moraines which circle round the openingof the greater
valleys on the southern side of the Alps, and extend beyond the
limits of the existing lakes, rest upon diluvium formed of the
same materials as the moraines, but extensively water-worn, the
pebbles being rounded and usually smaller in size, and the ma
terials partially sifted and imperfectly strati<U+FB01>ed. The moraines
have evidently been left in their present position by the ancient
glaciers which <U+FB01>lled up for a long period the lake-basins ; but
before the glaciers had <U+FB01>lled these basins, how was the diluvium
carried across such long and deep hollows as those occupied by
the great Italian lakes? M. Mortillet argues, with apparent
justice, that in order to reach the plain it must have <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled
up the intervening hollows. The conclusion does not, however,
seem to me necessary; and I will venture to suggest two alter
natives, either or both of which in succession seem to me more
 satisfactory.
    It is quite certain that during the period when the diluvium
was being reduced to its present condition, and was spread out
over the valley of the Po and the plain of Friuli, that tract was
the bed of a shallow sea; and there is good reason to suspect
 many oscillations of level between the meiocene period and the
 last great extension of the glaciers, during which the region in
 question may have been alternately uplifted and submerged.
 Geologists who have renounced the doctrines of the cataclysmal
 school have yet retained much of the language and habits of
 thought which were there learned. It is still their tendency to
 speak and think as if the history of the earth were that of a
 series of great events (revolutionary periods) separated by in
 tervals of repose, rather than a slowly rolling cycle of incessant
 change wherein the same natural agents, perhaps in altered
 combinations and with varying intensity, constantly recur.
 Since the importance of ice as an agent in geological change
 has been clearly demonstrated, geologists have concentrated
 their thoughts upon a single period immediately preceding the
 establishment and actual distribution of the present fauna and
 <U+FB02>ora, and have, in accordance with their habitual tendency, called
 this the glacial epoch. I am of course aware that some geolo
 gists have pointed out the traces of glacial action at former
 geological periods ; but it cannot be said that they have generally
 recognized the reasonable conclusion, that if one of the latest
 conditions of the earth admitted of a great extension of glacial
 action, a similar combination of causes must probably have
brought about the same effects at many recurring periods.
    To my mind there is nothing strange in the supposition that
the materials of the diluvium of the valley of the Po were
brought down from the upper valleys of the Alps and across the

                    Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.                93
  lake-basins by glaciers, and by them shot out as rubbish on the
  margin of the plain, before the latest invasion of the sea, exactly
  in the same manner as we know that the still existing moraines
  were at a later period deposited. If the sea rose before the
  glaciers retired to the upper valleys, ice-rafts of great dimensions
  laden with moraine would have <U+FB02>oated down the <U+FB01>ord-like inlets,
  and would have rapidly melted on reaching the open sea. When
  ever this did not rise much above the present level of the lakes,
  it is likely that the materials of the diluvium were accumulated
  near the lower end of each lake by the stranding of the ice-rafts
  on the shallow bar. It is even doubtful whether some supposed
  moraines have not been formed in this manner. In either or
  both of the two modes here indicated (by a solid causeway of
  ice, or by <U+FB02>oating ice-rafts) I believe that the diluvium, as well
  as the more recent glacial deposits, have been borne from the
  central regions of the Alps to the plains of northern Italy ; and
  I am the more persuaded of this because I know of no other
  means by which so vast a mass of solid materials could have
  been carried so great a distance. The action of running water
  has been perhaps underrated of late as a means of cutting a
  passage through even hard rock; but it is difficult to think too
  meanly of it as an agent for the transport, on a great scale, of
  solid fragments over a wide space, such as intervenes between
  the St. Gothard and the plain below Arona, or between the
  Stelvio and Monza, the one distance approaching near to, the
 other considerably exceeding, 100 miles. Fine sand and <U+FB01>ner
 mud are carried in vast quantities by existing currents; but
 even where these appear to bring down rolled specimens of the
 rocks that surround their sources, it generally turns out that
 such pebbles are picked out from some ancient ice-borne de
 posits lying near the banks or in the bed of the stream. The
 effects even of such exceptional events as the well-known <U+FB02>ood
 in the valley of the Drause, the like of which recur at intervals
 in every part of the Alps, are limited within very moderate
 limits ,- and, though, the Lake of Geneva were <U+FB01>lled up to facili
 tate the transport, I doubt whether a million of Drause-<U+FB02>oods
 would hear any appreciable amount of diluvium to the site of
the city of Geneva.
    If this were the proper occasion, there are many observations
in M. Mortillet’s valuable papers that deserve further discus
sion, and some of the details in his sketch of the ancient glaciers
of northern Italy, to which I should be inclined to except; but
I pass these over, and also forbear some remarks which I might
offer upon two interesting papers by M. E. Desor, wherein the
writer attempts a classi<U+FB01>cation of alpine lakes, which, saving
some details, seems to me founded on just views.

  94:                Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
     I might here close these remarks, which are directed rather
  to combat what appears to me excessive in recent theories, than
  to attempt a complete explanation of the origin of alpine valleys
  and lakes. Probably the time is not yet come for a solution of
  the difficulties connected with this great problem ; but a writer
 with no scienti<U+FB01>c reputation to defend, who has often been led
 to re<U+FB02>ect on the subject in the presence of those great monu
 ments of the past history of the earth that survive in the Alps
 and in other mountain districts, may throw out for future dis
 cussion the result, though confessedly incomplete, of his own
 efforts to account for the phenomena.
     I may mention that my ideas on this subject have been formed
 in all but utter ignorance of the views of those geologists who
 have maintained opinions somewhat similar, and in particular of
 those of Constant Prevost and Dana. I am very imperfectly
 aware of the progress of speculation even at present in the
 same direction; but it seems to me that, while both the writers
 above-named, and several others, have proceeded in the right
 track, they have not followed out the fundamental conception
 with the requisite strictness to its legitimate consequences. That
 the earth has gradually cooled down from a previous high tem
 perature during the period which has intervened between the
 earliest geological record and the latest tertiary epoch, and that
 by a necessary consequence it has diminished in volume during
 the same period, is the belief of many, probably of nearly all
 geologists. This hypothesis, duly followed out, leads us towards
 an explanation of the origin of mountain chains, and the cor
 related depressions, which, if not quite complete, appears to me
 far more satisfactory than any other, and readily applicable to
the leading points of the orography of the Alps. Those who
have speculated on the subject eem to me to have erred in look
ing to local subsidence as the chief mechanical result of con
 traction by cooling, and more especially when they have supposed
certain areas of the earth’ s surface to have been, in a special and
exceptional sense, areas of cooling.
    The postulates which may, as I think, be justly assumed for the
purpose of reasoning on the hypothesis in question are these :—
    1. From the period when organic life commenced on the sur
faceof ourplanet, the outerportion of the crust must have assumed
a temperature not far removed from that which it now possesses,
and which depends mainly upon the ratio between the heat re
ceived from the sun and that lost by radiation.
    2. The inner portion of the crust, and the nucleus, usually
supposed to be viscous or <U+FB02>uid, being cooled with extreme slow
ness by conduction, would contract much more than the outer
surface of the spheroid.

                  Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.               95
   3. The process of cooling would be continuous and uniform,
subject only to tri<U+FB02>ing local variations arising from the unequal
accumulation of sedimentary strata over particular areas, and
the unequal conductive power of certain portions of the crust.
   4. No substance is absolutely rigid; and there is no reason
 to doubt that amorphous masses of mineral matter, such as
 constitute all rocks, are capable, under adequate force, of a con
 siderable amount of <U+FB01>exure.
   5. From a very early period in the earth’s history, dating
from the <U+FB01>rst appearance of water on the surface, if not earlier,
inequalities in the outer surface, arising from denudation in
some areas, and the accumulation of sedimentary strata in
Others, must have begun to exist, and have been continually
extended and varied ever since by the action of the various
causes that have brought the crust to its present condition.
    It is conceivable, and even probable, that during some con
 siderable period of the earlier history of the earth, the amount of
contraction from cooling in successive concentric shells may
have continued to be approximately proportional to their distance
from the centre of the spheroid, in which case no mechanical
forces would be called into play that would tend to alter the
form of the outer surface. The conditions were altered from the
time when the outer crust, having approached to a constant
temperature, ceased to keep pace with the contraction of the
interior, and I ask the reader to consider the necessary effects
of that change.
   To <U+FB01>x our ideas, let us take an area of 500 miles squared, and
assume that during a certain period (which would be of enor
mous length if counted by years) the radius of the earth had
contracted through cooling by 1200 yards, equal to about a
6000th part of its own length. Using round numbers, which
suffice to illustrate the argument, the result of this change will
have been to force the outer crust of the area under considera
tion to occupy a space less by 150 yards in every direction than
before the contraction. If the crust were of uniform rigidity
throughout the same area, and also in the adjoining regions, the
result must be a general crushing and crumpling of the surface;
but we have taken it fora certainty that in reality the condition
of things has been otherwise, and that lines of least resistance
have existed which must have determined the yielding of the
crust in one direction rather than another. Let us assume that
in the regions adjoining the given area the preponderating
 direction in which the crust had already yielded was N. and S.,
 in which case the pressure transverse to that direction will have
 been diminished, and therefore that, during the given period
 within the same area, the forces acting on the crust must be

96                 Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
mainly lateral forces compressing the mass in the direction of the
meridian. To form a more accurate idea of the changes which
would result, let us take an imaginary meridional section 500
miles in length, and suppose that the least-resisting part of the
crust lies at the centre of the section, the rigidity increasing
gradually on either side. As we have already seen, the mechani
cal e<U+FB01>'ect which will be produced by the action of gravity (as
sumed to be capable of overcoming the resistance of the mass)
will be to force each extremity of the section to approach the
centre by 75 yards. The <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>exure having occurred at the
centre, the ordinary laws of the resistance of imperfectly elastic
and imperfectly rigid bodies lead to the formation of parallel
ridges with intermediate depressions extending on either side of
the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB02>exure within limits depending on the <U+FB02>exibility and
compressibility of the crust. We shall assume the limit at 50
miles on either side of the centre. The annexed <U+FB01>gure will give
some idea of the nature of the vertical disturbances, the scale
being very greatly magni<U+FB01>ed to make them sensible to the eye,
and no attempt being made to exhibit the curvature of the
surface.
   The dotted line A B shows the section of the original surface
before the period of disturbance, and A1 B‘ that after subsidence,
with a series of ridges and depressions, highest at the centre C‘,
and extending to D‘ and E‘ respectively 50 miles from C‘. No
vertical disturbancewill have arisen in the portions A‘ D‘ and E‘B‘,
but a displacement has nevertheless been caused which deserves
attention. Having left out of view the changes going on in
neighbouring areas, we must assume that the subsidence from
A and B to A‘ and B‘ has been vertical; but in that case the
portion of the section A D, which by hypothesis has not sensibly
contracted by cooling, and which has not suffered <U+FB02>exure, can
assume its new position A‘ D‘ only by the relative displacement
of D‘ 60 yards nearer to C‘, and a general displacement of the
whole section A‘ D‘, which will gradually increase from A‘ where
it is nil, to the maximum at D‘. The same displacement in the
opposite direction would occur in the subsidence of E B to E‘ B‘.
   Between the surface AB and a stratum lying at some depth,
probably considerable, where the rate of cooling would be
sensibly the same as that of the nucleus, there must be an

                    Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.               97
    intermediate condition of portions of the crust which well de
    serves notice. The lines A2 B’ and A3 B“ represent the condition
    of some portions of the crust where the amount of cooling during
    the assumed period has caused a contraction of 50 yards and
    100 yards respectively in the length of the portion lying between
    the verticals A B3 and B B’. In each case the insufficient con
    traction of those portions of the crust must be supplemented by
    some <U+FB02>exure and disturbance of the strata, but the deeper we
    descend, and the more the rate of cooling has approached to
    that of the interior, the less disturbance will have arisen.
      In the illustration here proposed, it will be seen that if the
   zone of least resistance had happened to lie due E. and W.,
   every meridional section across the same area would show the
   point of maximum <U+FB02>exure at the centre, and we should have a
   single mountain chain running due E. and W. across the middle
   of the area; but if the zone of least resistance should happen to

   pendicular to the meridian, we                   Fig_ g_
   should have a series of parallel                    N

  sents the zone of least resistance,
  and the broad black lines the
  axes of as many systems of
  parallel ridges.     The fact that
  such a disposition of mountain
 ranges frequently occurs, is M
 familiar to all who have studied
 the orography of the Alps and                          5
 other high mountain districts.
     In the incalculable lapse of geological time during which the
 same causes must have continued to cause disturbances of the
 Outer crust of the earth, but under varied conditions of resist
 ance, it is clear, on the one hand, that the direction in which the
 force of compression would act on a given portion of the surface
would be liable to continued but slow variation, and on the other,
that there must be an interdependence between the disturbances
arising in adjoining regions, even though these should cover
very large areas. As a general rule it seems inevitable that a
mountain district once formed would become for the surrounding
regions a zone of least resistance, which would be liable to
undergo new <U+FB02>exures according as pressure came to operate in
new directions, and that we ought to <U+FB01>nd the traces of such
transverse compression in the formation of parallel ridges lying
at various angles to the main lines of <U+FB01>exure, and at the same
time that these secondary ridges should be far less regular than

  98                Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
  the primary ridges and furrows which mark the earlier corruga
  tions of the surface.
      In considering the mechanical effects of lateral compression
  applied transversely to the direction which has caused the earlier
  and predominant <U+FB02>exures of the surface, we are led to speculate
  on the probability of fracture owing to the inability of the ridges
  to yield to the necessary extent in a new direction. The actual
                                 Fig. 3.
  occurrence of such fractures would depend upon the plasticity
  of the materials ; but the summit of each convex <U+FB01>exure would
  necessarily sustain a tension competent under given conditions
  to cause rupture. It can scarcely be by an accident that the
  annexed <U+FB01>gure, which appears to be an ideal illustration, does
  actually represent, in a rude fashion, the main ridges and trans
  verse valleys of western Switzerland and northern Savoy. If
  the lines A A‘, B B‘, C C‘, and D D‘ be taken to represent the axes
  of elevation of the Jura and the chief ranges of the Alps, the
  reader will have no dif<U+FB01>culty in identifying in the short longi
  tudinal lines the valley of Chambéry from Montmelian to Culoz,
  the valley of the Chéran, that of Annecy, the gorge of the Isere
  between Albertville and Montiers, the de<U+FB01>le of Maglan, the
  valleys of Montjoie, Bonneval, and Tignes, the Val d’Entremont,
  and that of the Rhone from Martigny to Vevay, the Eringer
  Thal, Ein<U+FB01>sch Thal, Saas Thal, the pass of the Simplon, the
' Valley of Hasli, the Valley of the Reuss, &c. It will not escape
  notice that nearly all the transverse valleys above enumerated,
  and many others of less importance that might be added to the
  list, are wholly or in part narrow de<U+FB01>les. There can be no doubt
  that water and ice have contributed largely to give them their
  present form ,- but the same causes have acted elsewhere without _
  producing the same general character of valley.
     This is not the occasion on which to attempt to apply in

                    Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.              99
    detail the principles here advocated, nor do I pretend to have
    the requisite amount of special knowledge. They appear to me
    to account for a large number of the broader facts of general
    orography, and n1ore especially for many of the peculiarities in
    the conformation of the Alps that have attracted the attention
    of geologists. Of the former class I may instance the almost
    continuous zone of mountains that traverse the eastern hemi
    sphere between the 30th and 50th parallels of latitude, through
   out which the prevailing tendency of the ridges approaches to
   parallelism with the equator, together with the general tendency
   towards a meridional direction in the ranges N. and S. of that
   zone.
      Of the leading facts of alpine orography which <U+FB01>nd their
   explanation in the development of the views here propounded, I
   would in the <U+FB01>rst place note the connexion between the principal
   peaks and the secondary ridges that diverge from the main
   ranges of the Alps. The secondary ridges again, in their turn,
   very frequently show in their outline a succession of prominences
   and depressions which sometimes present a remarkable accord
  ance on the opposite sides of a deep valley, and are most easily
   explained by considering them to result from the intersection of
  transverse lines of <U+FB02>exure—one set of furrows being represented
  by the existing valleys, and another by the inequalities in the
  ridges which enclose them. Another indication of the same
  phenomenon is apparent in the ancient lake-basins, very fre
  quently <U+FB01>lled up, which recur in succession as we ascend through
  so many valleys in the Alps. As already remarked, these lake
  basins were formerly larger and deeper, being almost invariably
 separated by narrow de<U+FB01>les cut through barriers of rock which
 once enclosed them.
     The formation of several of the greater lakes of Switzerland,
 which have been called lakes of erosion, may be shown to be the
 natural consequence of the continued action of the causes here
 pointed out. It will be obvious that whenever forces adequate
 to cause <U+FB01>exure act upon a mountain district in a direction dif
 ferent from that which has produced the pre-existing undulations
 of the surface, they will leave in the new ridges which they origi
 nate distinct evidence of their action, and, generally speaking,
 of the period at which they operated. But when the direction
coincides with that of forces previously impressed upon the sur
face, the whole effect of the renewed action in the same direc
tion will be to increase the existing inequalities, raising the
ridges, and deepening the valleys, without leaving any indica
tion of the period at which the action was resumed, or whether
it had ever been interrupted. The great ridges and depressions
which have determined the main features of the Alps, which in
                                   H 2

100               Mr. J. Ball on the Formation of
Switzerland and Savoy lie between W.S.W. and E.N.E., and in
the Eastern Alps are directed more accurately from W. to E.,
are the aggregate results of the action, whether constant or
intermittent, of lateral compression ever since the elevation
commenced, a period which probably extends from the origin of
the earliest palaeozoic rocks to the present time. Though the
conception is fundamentally different from that of local subsi
dence, the effect may sometimes be scarcely distinguishable.
   That the meiocene period was one of immense duration is suf
<U+FB01>ciently proved even to geologists who know the formation only
in Switzerland ;. and it is equally certain that it was accompanied
by considerable disturbance of the surface. I can see no diffi
culty in admitting the probability of the action of forces trans
verse to the main chain of the Alps and the Jura during, and
subsequent to, the meiocene period, which would have deepened
previously existing depressions on the site of the lakes of Neu
 chatel, Bienne, Morat, and the western part of the Lake of
 Geneva. The eastern part of the latter lake has probably a dif
 ferent origin. There is nothing, so far as I know, in the coun
try between Bex and the Triassic rocks of Meillerie to make it
unlikely that a lake may have existed there before the meiocene
epoch.
    I shall very brie<U+FB02>y notice a few of the difficulties which occur
to some minds in regard to the main principles which are here
very imperfectly developed. It is sometimes objected that the
formation of ridges and furrows upon the rigid crust of the
earth in thelmanner here suggested, without corresponding
undulations of the more deeply situated portions of the crust,
 assumed to be viscid from high temperature, implies the forma
tion of hollows and vacant spaces, owing to the want of confor
mity in the <U+FB02>exures of the upper surface with those of the inner
 mass. Without stopping to discuss the possibility of the occa
sional occurrence of such vacant spaces in certain strata, aided, it
may be, by the more rapid cooling of the earth’s nucleus which
 some suppose to have proceeded during preceding geological
periods, I reply that the objection rests upon an imperfect idea.
 of the action of force upon. the solid materials of the globe. I
have no doubt that all rocks possess in some measure that pro
perty which, when highlyideveloped, we call plasticity, under
the action of adequate force applied with the requisite slowness.
During the process of <U+FB02>exure, as I understand it, a portion of the
 earth’s crust lies, as it were, in a mould, which changes its form,
it may be, at the rate of a few yards in a million of years ; and
the same quality which permits <U+FB02>exure permits that limited
degree of mobility of the parts which su<U+FB02>ices to <U+FB01>ll up the space
that would otherwise be vacated by the <U+FB01>exure. The fact that

                    Alpine Valleys and Alpine Lakes.               101
   ‘such an effect has been produced is constantly exhibited on a
   small scale in the natural sections that abound throughout the
   Alps, wherein the existence of unconformable <U+FB02>exures is shown
   not to lead to the formation of hollows in the interior of a con
   torted mass of rock.
      Another objection of a general character is derived from the
   existence of large portions of the earth’s surface which exhibit no
   traces of considerable <U+FB02>exure, although the hypothesis requires
   us to admit the continued action, during an immense period of
   time, of forces competent to cause vertical disturbance.       This
   objection has been partly anticipated in the preceding pages.
   It has been shown that at the time when the existing inequalitie
   of the surface began, some adjoining regions may probably have
   escaped displacement, except a moderate amount of lateral shift
   ing towards the -area of disturbance; and it has been remarked
  that a mountain district, once formed, would probably continue
  to receive new <U+FB02>exures and thereby relieve the pressure on the
  adjoining areas. Furthermore, in reference to certain districts
  where very ancient sedimentary rocks appear to have remained
  nearly undisturbed, it is not impossible that overlying and more
  contorted strata may have been removed by denudation, and that
  the earlier strata may have partly escaped <U+FB02>exure for the reason
  already pointed out, viz. that they in some measure kept pace
  with the rate of cooling of the deeper portions of the crust.
     The objections apparently most formidable, and of which I do
 not doubt that at numerous array may be adduced by men so well
 versed in the local geology of the Alps as M. Desor and Professor
 Ramsay—not to name others whose views I may controvert—
 rest upon the apparent discordance between the strati<U+FB01>cation of
 the sedimentary formations, and the <U+FB02>exures indicated by the
 present relief of the surface. I have no doubt_ that there are
 many facts apparently opposed to the views here advanced which
 I should <U+FB01>nd it di<U+FB02>icult or impossible to explain: but I would
observe that the problems raised are of extreme complexity; and
if I am right in believing that the present conformation of the
Alps is the complex sum of the operation of forces of compression
in various directions, and under varied conditions, through an
enormous period of geological time, I am entitled to assume
that the unravelling of so tangled a network of causation must
be a matter of all but insuperable dif<U+FB01>culty. It will be obvious
that, in studying the relations of the strati<U+FB01>cation in successive
formations, we have to determine the probable condition of the
surface at the time when each was deposited, and the various
<U+FB02>exnres which it has since undergone, which would differently
modify the disposition of the beds according as they led to frac
ture, or bent the mass without breaking its continuity. Add to

these the effects of denudation on an immense scale, and the
 minor, but still important, mechanical action of water and ice,
and it is not surprising if many difficulties long remain unsolved.
At present the important point is to <U+FB01>nd the true clue through
the labyrinth. Of some of the main dit<U+FB01>culties in alpine stra
ti<U+FB01>cation, and especially of what has been called the fan structure,
I think that the hypothesis here advanced gives a better explana
tion than any other that I know. The <U+FB01>nal decision may probably
await more minute and persevering study of the structure of the
Alps than has even yet been given, although the names of great
geologists, deceased or still living, seem to contradict the sug
gestion.
   The hypothesis of lateral compression, in the form in which it
presents itself to my mind, is absolutely inconsistent with the
maxims of the cataclysmal school of geology. If mountain
chains owe their elevation to the gradual cooling of the earth, it
is a <U+FB02>at contradiction of the laws of physics to infer, as an Ame
rican writer has done, the possibility of the sudden. elevation of
a mountain a mile in height, or even an incomparably less
amount of rapid disturbance. More cautious reasoning should
lead us to expect that the vertical disturbances would be abso
lutely insensible, but that the lateral displacements, encounter
ing greater and more unequal resistance, might sometimes cause
sensible effects. Whether we may here <U+FB01>nd a cause of earth
quakes, indirectly connected with the elevation of certain moun
tain chains, is a question which I am not now prepared to discuss.
   It is scarcely necessary to advert to exceptional causes which
may have operated in the formation of certain mountain-valleys.
   For instance, in the Eastern Alps there seems reason to sup
pose that the chemical changes which led to the formation of
dolomite were accompanied by contraction in the mass of corre
sponding portions of the Jurassic rocks, causingirregular cracks
and <U+FB01>ssures, which, enlarged by marine action, have produced
the irregular disposition of the valleys, and the characteristic
forms of the peaks in that district.
   To conclude, I am persuaded that there is no single valley of
the Alps that does not owe its present form in great part to the
action of glaciers, and it is a great gain that all the modes of
action of this powerful agent should be fully studied; but, while
believing that the main features of the surface have originated in
more general causes, I feel surprise that Professor Tyndall has
not referred more pointedly to another agent which has surely
had even a larger share than that of glaciers in fashioning the
great alpine masses.       He rightly rejects running water as a
means of extensive excavation, but he does not seem to have
considered the effects of long-continued marine action upon steep

     XIII. On the Chemical Composition of some Chilian Minerals.
                     By DAVID Fonnns, F.R.S. 2512*
            Hg/alrous Bibasic Arseniate of Nickel and Cobalt.
  THIS mineral, apparently a new species, occurs in veins in a
          semi-decomposed greenstone or dioritic rock, which breaks
  through the upper oolitic strata in the Desert of Atacama at
  about twenty leagues to the eastward of the port of Flamenco.
 The upper part of these veins contain it in abundance; but after
 a few yards in depth it appears to pass into chloanthite, from
 which mineral it appears to have been originally derived.
     It occurs in <U+FB01>bro-crystalline masses, an agglomeration of cry
 stalline <U+FB01>bres united longitudinally ; colour greyish white ; lustre
 non-metallic, dull up to silky or resinous; streak non-metallic,
 earthy ; powder white; hardness 2'5.
     The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of three different specimens was respect
 ively as follows: 3134, 3069, and 3054, consequently a mean
 of 3086.
     Before the blowpipe alone, upon charcoal in reducing <U+FB02>ame, it
 evolves water, changes colour, fuses imperfectly, and produces
 metallic globules of a basic arsenide of nickel and cobalt, evolv
 ing at the same time arsenical fumes in abundance. In the oxida
 ting <U+FB02>ame alone it is nearly infusible. With borax in the oxida
 ting <U+FB02>ame it dissolves completely, forming a dirty brownish-blue
 glass, owing its colour to the oxides of nickel and cobalt dis
 solved; in the reducing <U+FB02>ame with borax it yields abluish glass,
 along with a metallic globule of basic arsenide of nickel and
 cobalt. When heated in a closed tube, it does not decrepitate nor
 change form, but evolves water and darkens in colour, becoming
then of a dirty greenish- or brownish-grey colour; in open tube
it gives the same reactions.
  Upon analysis, the following percentage resultswere obtained:—

   From the above, it will be seen that this mineral is analogous
to pharmacolite, 2CaO, AsO"’+6HO, in which all the lime is
replaced by the protoxides of nickel and cobalt, but differs in
having eight instead of only six equivalents of water: in this
last respect it resembles the other tribasic arseniates of nickel,
cobalt, and zinc—Annabergite, erythrine, and Kottigite.
   It is remarkable that this mineral is colourless notwithstand
ing its containing so large a proportion of the protoxides of
nickel and cobalt, the combinations of which are so generally
distinguished by their more or less prominent tints.
   Along with the_above-mentioned mineral is frequently found
a sulphur-yellow compound in thin amorphous scales, or rather
crusts: on qualitative examination it yielded arsenic, nickel, and
cobalt, but was extremely di<U+FB02>icult to obtain entirely free from
 the preceding mineral, from which reason it has not as yet been
 analysed. Possibly it may be the mineral from Johann-Geor
 genstadt examined by Bergmann*, with the following results :—

    The locality of this mineral is the silver mine of San Antonio

 the mine is situated in the beds of porphyry conglomerate and

     In this analysis the copper and arsenic are so nearly in the
 proportion of Domeykite (which would require 7'2 copper to the

 case. Deducting therefore this amount, as well as the gangue,

   Amongst the argentiferous minerals found in Chanorcillo,
Domeyko* enumerates, without further description, a combina-_
tion of antimony and silver, which yielded to l11S analysis

   From these results, it will at once be seen that this mineral
must be totally different in composition from either of the varie
ties of discrasite hitherto described, and which have respectively
the following formulae and percentage composition :—

   Besides this mineral, another compound of antimony with
silver is also found, and much resembles in appearance native
silver, especially when burnished, but can easily be rubbed to -
powder in a mortar, which at once distinguishes it. A specimen
of this mineral obtained from the mine Rosario contained, accord

   with traces of arsenic ,- other specimens are stated to have yielded
   from 4 to 6 per cent. of antimony along with some arsenic. It
   would therefore appear probable that this mineral is represented
   by the formula Ag18 Sb, which requires
                      Silver . . . . . 93'78

   We consequently now have no less than four distinct compounds
   of silver with antimony, represented respectively by the formulae
                 Age Sb, A54 Sb, Ag“ Sb, and Ag“ Sb.
                      Arsenic-antimoniole of Silver.
     This mineral occurs in the form of grains disseminated through
  out carbonate of lime, and is very similar in appearance to native
  silver. On treating the mass with acetic acid, the carbonate of
  lime dissolves and the mineral remains behind in the form of
  brilliant metallic grains, which, when submitted to the action of
  the blowpipe, emit abundant fumes of arsenic and antimony.

     Upon calculation, it will be found that the equivalents most
 approximating to these results are 1OAg, 2Fe, 6As, and 3Sb,
 which will give the following percentage composition :—
                       12 1OAg           5473 Silver.
                               2Fe        2'84 Iron.

     Considering the iron to replace a part of the silver, we have
 the formula (Ag Fe)4 (As Sb)”. Domeyko looks upon the iron
 as being in the state of biarsenide*, and considers that the rest
'of the arsenic, along with the antimony and silver, are combined
to form Ag’ (As Sb)”, which he considers is equivalent to a com
bination of one atom sesquiarsenide of silver with one atom ses
 quiantimonide of silver.
                               Arseniale of Silver.
     Whilst in Copiapo several specimens were given me under
this name, but, upon submitting these to chemical examination,
                 * Elementos de Mineralogia, 2nd edit. p. 190.

 108         Mr. D. Forbes on the Chemical Composition
none of them were found to contain arsenic in true combination
with the silver.
   One specimen from the Retamo, north-east of Copiapo, was
native silver in coarse interwoven threads, which upon inspection
appeared to be regular octahedrons, as it were drawn out and
elongated until their length equalled some <U+FB01>fteen times the
measure of their short axis. Upon assay they yielded 9986
per cent. silver.
   Another specimen from Punta Brava, also near Copiapo,
proved to be native arsenic massive, but curiously woven
through, if the term may be used, with wonderfully <U+FB01>ne <U+FB01>la
ments or threads of native silver free from arsenic.
   When examining the Mina Marguarita at Bandurias near
Chanarcillo, I found, however, a peculiar dull grey mineral,
semi-malleable, and which, on burnishing, received an almost
silver-white polish, situated in quartz, in which it occurred as
small grains or plates associated with smaltine. All the speci
mens I obtained appeared too impure to be then considered
worthy of a quantitative analysis, but on examination by the
blowpipe they gave a strong reaction of arsenic, and left a globule
of silver behind on the charcoal.
   Lately Domeyko has examined a mineral also from Bandu
rias, but mine not speci<U+FB01>ed, which is stated to occurin a matrix
of white argillaceous carbonate of lime, and in colour to vary
from lead-grey to tin-white. Upon pulverizing the specimens,
they were found to consist of a mixture of several metallic mine
rals independent of the gangue. A ductile mineral in granules
<U+FB02>attened by the blows was easily separated from the more pul
verizable portion, which in turn, by means of washing, was again
separated into a heavy metallic powder, and a lighter, black,
earthy-looking sediment.
   These three products have been separately analysed by Do
meyko, who, however, has contented himself with stating the
numerical results of his analyses, without speculating as to their
possible chemical constitution. The results obtained were as
follows :—
                    Metallic granules.   Metallic powder. Black sediment.

                             99-9             978            99-05

                      of some C/zilian Minerals.                 109
     In considering the composition of the <U+FB01>rst of these, or metallic
  granules, the ratio of the arsenic to the other bases is nearly
  that of the formula Ags As, which would give the following per
  centage composition :—
                    Arsenic    .  .   .  .   10'37
                    Silver .  .   .   .  .   89'63
                                            100'OO
 And if we look upon the silver as being in small part replaced by
 the mercury, iron, and cobalt found in the analysis, the formula
   Ag, Hg Fe, Co)6 As doubtless represents the constitution of
 these metallic granules.
    The second product (the metallic powder left behind in wash
 ing) is somewhat more complicated: deducting the gangue,
 and recalculating the results to percentages, we obtain the com
 position of the clean metallic powder as follows :—
                    Silver .   .  .   .  .   4393
                    Iron .     .   .   .  .  1524
                    Cobalt .    .  .   . .    9'17
                    Nickel .   .  .   .   .   0'63
                    Arsenic    .  .    .  .  29'92
                    Antimony .     .   .  .   1'11
                                            10000
 If now we unite the nickel with the cobalt as well as the arsenic
 and antimony, on calculation, the equivalents which approximate
most closely to the terms of the analysis are Ag‘, Fe5, C03, and
As‘, which, expressed in percentages, gives
                    Silver .   .  .   .  .   4.496
                    Iron    .  .  .   .  .   14'58

                                            100-00
The equivalents of the metals being to those of the arsenic in the
ratio of 12 to 4, we have the formula (Ag Fe CO)?’ As, a tri
basic arsenide of silver with iron and cobalt, which represents
the constitution of this compound.
    We have now only to dispose of the black sediment, which
was least {in speci<U+FB01>c gravity. Deducting from the analysis
already given of this product the gangue, and recalculating the
percentages of the other components, the analysis will then stand
as follows :—

    These results indicate at a glance the composition of smaltine,
di<U+FB01>ering in no respect from the mineral usually met with, except
in being somewhat more argentiferous. Notwithstanding the
impurity of this mineral mixture, there can be no doubt as to
the existence of one or more true compounds of silver with
arsenic; and, as before stated, the formulae Ag6 As and Ag8 As,
which represent the compounds here described, very probably are
de<U+FB01>nite mineral species, which on further search may be obtained
in a purer condition.
                      Sulp/iide of Lead and Zinc. I
    This mineral is found in a mine at lngahuas in the depart
ment of Huasco, where it occurs in the form of rather large
lumps or nodules. It is lighter in colour, and possesses less
 lustre than galena, which mineral it in most points resembles,
 except in its peculiarly compacted and homogeneous saccharoidal
 structure, which, even when examined by a magni<U+FB01>er, discloses
 no intermixture of any other mineral, nor trace whatever of
zincblende.
    Its composition, according to Domeyko, is

    Calculating the percentage of lead, sulphur, and zinc, after
 deducting the amount of gangue and loss, we have the composi
tion of the pure mineral shown as follows :—
                    Lead.         .      .       .      .     .   52-03

which numbers approximate very closely to 2 equivalents lead,

                                Taltalite.
    This new mineral has, since the year 1858, been found in
 immense quantities in the mines of Senor Moreno, a short distance
 inland from Taltal in the Desert of Atacama, constituting the
 bulk of the supply of copper ores derived from those mines. 1t
 is of a black or brownish-black colour, with from a dull up to a
 satiny or vitreous lustre, and has a blackish-grey streak. It
 occurs in masses consisting of an agglomeration of long crystal
 line <U+FB01>bres apparently quite pure, but sometimes accompanied by
 Atacamite and copper-glance, which minerals are frequently
 interposed between the <U+FB01>bres. An analysis by Domeyko afforded

    The numerous specimens 1 obtained when in that part of
Chile are all so extremely homogeneous and crystalline in struc
ture as to put aside the idea of this mineral being amere mecha
nical mixture, and enforce the conclusion that it is a de<U+FB01>nite
compound.
    The water which appears in the above analysis is most probably
not essential to its constitution, and in part at least is doubt
lessly united with the chlorine and some of the copper present,
forming Atacamite, which, as before mentioned, is frequently
found inserted between the <U+FB01>bres of the minerals. Calculating
Atacamite as represented by the formula CuCl+3CuO +5 HO,
the amount of chlorine present (07) would be equivalent to 4'56
per cent. Atacamite, which, if deducted from the above results
(along with the excess of water), and the quantities of the respec
tive components recalculated to make up the hundred parts, will
give the following composition a that of the pure mineral :—

                      10000
   The equivalents most approximating to the above composition
are 9CuO, 1 Fe2 03, 2A152 O3+3SiO3, in which it is considered
that the lime and magnesia present replace a portion of the prot
oxide of copper; these would give the following percentage com
position for the mineral :—
Protoxideofcopper. 49'28 containingOxygen 9'91

                      10000
   As above stated, it will be seen that the amount of oxygen
contained in the bases is double that of the silica, also that the
oxygen contained in the protoxides is about equal to that of the
sesquioxides ; consequently we obtain the formula

it is much to be desired that a new analysis be made of the
mineral, and for this purpose that the purest portions obtainable
be employed.
        Hydrous Silica-phosphate of Alumina and Copper.
   Under the names of cupreous phosphate of alumina and
turquoise, Domeyko* has described a mineral whose chemical
composition does not very correctly entitle it to either of these
denominations. The mineral has a pale turquoise-blue colour,
has a compact homogeneous earthy fracture, and is scratched by
the nail. It is found on the estate of San Lorenzo de la Ligua,
in the province of Aconcagua, where it forms blue veins in a
white decomposed felspathic rock. When heated, it gives olf
water and changes colour, becoming of a yellowish-grey tint : it
is decomposed by acids. Its chemical composition is stated as
follows :—

        The presence of so large an amount of silica, and the small
    percentage of phosphoric acid (but little above one-half that con
    tained in the turquoise), at once distinguishes this mineral from
   the true turquoise for which Dana has given the formula

114         Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Motion of Camphor
the discovery of the mineral Hayesite in Chile, as well as its
mode of occurrence and formation, placed this question, I believe,
beyond a doubt.
    The mineral alluded to is found in suspension in the waters
of the hot springs called the Bafios del Toro situated in the Cor
dilleras of Coquimbo, and occurs in the form of beautiful snow
white silky or feathery <U+FB02>akes, which ultimately subside and form
a. light <U+FB02>aky sediment of this mineral in a perfectly pure state,
as shown by a qualitative analysis made upon a portion of the
same.
    The process of its formation is at once most simple and inter
esting.    The hot vapours, due, without doubt, to the proximity of
the neighbouring volcanoes of this chain of mountains, here
make their escape through channels or crevices which conduct
them into these springs of water previously highly charged with
carbonate of lime in solution, taken up by the water from the
decomposing lime felspars of the porphyries and porphyritie tulfs
(with intercalated limestones) and sandstones which here repre
sent the upper oolitic period; as might be expected, the boracic
acid gas contained in these vapours bubbling up through the cal
careous waters combines directly with the lime, producing the
silky <U+FB02>akes of borate of lime (Hayesine) thus seen in course of
formation, whilst at the same time the liberated carbonic acid
escapes into the atmosphere.
    It is hardly possible to produce a more beautiful illustration of
the actual formation of a mineral body. The Hayesine found as an
incrustation in the Tuscan borax lagoons is, without doubt, the
product of an analogous chemical action.
XIV. On the Motion of Camphor towards the Light. By CHARLES
    TOMLINSON, Lecturer on Physical Science, King’s College
    School, London.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,                          _
      R. DRAPER’S letter, contained in your last Number, has
        surprised me not a little. On the strength of a question
put in 1840, as to whether the side of the jar nearest the sun
may not be the colder, he claims the merit of the theory advanced
by me in your Number for November last.
    Dr. Draper’s question, put in 1840, was answered by him
self in his quarto volume, ‘On the Forces which produce the
Organization of Plants,’ published at New York in 1844. At
page 124 of the Appendix he says, “ It might be suggested
that when a vessel is exposed to the sun, that part of the glass

                         towards the Light.          '         115
which is nearest to him may actually be the coldest; such an
opinion, it is evident, rests on no su<U+FB02>icient grounds.”   He then
describes the experiment referred to by me in my paper, in which
a differential thermometer, enclosed in 'a jar and exposed to the
sun, proved that the side of the jar nearest to the sun was the
warmer, and adds, “Hence we know that in all cases where
crystals of camphor, dew of water, &c. are deposited on the side
next the sun, they are so deposited in opposition to an energetic
force which tends to remove them.”
   This is pretty strong evidence that Dr. Draper’s theory is very
different from mine.
   Again, he says, p. 120, “The sun’s rays have the power of
causing vapours to pass to the perihelion side of vessels in which
they are con<U+FB01>ned, but, as it would appear, not at all seasons of
the year.” He then describes a case in which, during December,
January, and part of February, “ a deposit was uniformly made
towards the sun; during the months of March, April, and part
of May next following, although every part of the arrangement
 remained to all appearance the same, yet the camphor was de
posited on the side furthest from the sun. It does not appear
that any immediate cause can be assigned for this waywardness.”
   Could Dr. Draper have put forward such a statement as this
in 1844, if he had had the slightest idea of the true theory of
the motion of camphor towards the light ?
   Again, p. 122, when a circular plate of glass was put into a
glass receiver above the camphor, no deposit was made on the
plate. Dr. Draper says, “It was not without surprise I observed
that, however long the plate was continued in the beams oflight,
no crystallization would ensue.” Cases of this kind are perfectly
explicable on my theory, and, indeed, I give several such.
   Commenting on such a case, Dr. Draper says that “ to reduc
tion of temperature we cannot look for an explanation.” I
prove that reduction of temperature is the only means'of ex
planation.
   Again, at p. 122, Dr. Draper says, “ Why does this con
densation take place on the hottest surface, the side nearest
to the plate ? We cannot admit that the rays of heat have any
active part in bringing about the phenomenon. On the other hand,
they ought rather to exert a contrary eifect, antagonizing the
powers that solicit the camphor crystals to form, and driving
them to the coldest surface. We are therefore reduced to the
supposition that, when the light of the sun impinges on a sur
face of glass, it places that surface in such a condition that it
exerts a pressure on the adjacent medium, immediately followed
by a condensation of that medium.”
   I have no idea what this means; but I would ask how it is
                                 I 2

116        Onithe Motion of Camplzor towards the Light.
possible Dr. Draper could sanction such statements in 1844, if,
as he says, he had adopted my theory in 1840?
   At page 124 he says that “light which has suffered re<U+FB02>exion
at certain angles seems to have undergone a remarkable modi<U+FB01>
cation, being no longer able to put the glass into such a condi
tion that it can cause motion towards the sun.” Does this look
like settled theory?
   Nor is the action of metal screens and tinfoil rings in pre
venting a deposit at all explained. At page 126 it is stated that
“the _ring exerts a kind of protecting action,” &c. Again,
“This action of a ring formed of good conducting materials
might be supposed to arise either from its adding something
to the surface of the glass, or taking something away from the
glass with which it is in contact ; or it might be imputed to some
change impressed on the ray of light,” &c.
   The electrical theory noticed in my paper is started at page
127. At page 128 it is stated that, if the inner surface of the
glass receiver be rubbed with a glass rod, the camphor will
deposit itself on the lines traced by the rod. Although the
explanation of this fact is perfectly easy *, yet Dr. Draper
compares the result with Lichtenberg’s electrical <U+FB01>gures, and
proceeds to ask, “ Are we to refer this singular action to the rays
of light, to the rays of heat, or to the chemical rays?” He
then proceeds to pass the light through solutions of ammonio
sulphate of copper, bichromate of potash, &c., and obtains what
he calls “ aphelion camphor deposits.” He says, “ It does not
 necessarily follow from the phenomena that any peculiar class
 of rays is emitted by the sun which bring about this action ;
 but if there are such, it is a question of interest to <U+FB01>nd what is
 the reason that good conductors of electricity render their action
 nugatory.”
    Now is it conceivable that Dr. Draper could have published
such statements as these in 1844 if he had had the faintest idea
of the true theory? Or is it conceivable that so industrious and
ingenious an experimentalist would not have devised experiments
to test his theory had it been the same as mine, and which he
now admits to be a su<U+FB01>icient one? I have looked in vain for
any indication of such an attempt. Instead of any settled
theory, I <U+FB01>nd a large number of theories, and a large number of
experiments, but nothing is settled. In fact Dr. Draper makes
a lottery of a number of theories, and draws out blanks so far as
the explanation of the phenomena in question is concerned;
and when, twenty years later, another inquirer draws a prize, he
claims it as having come from his original lottery.

Dr. Draper refers, has reference to this fact.

   impression on himself or on others. No scienti<U+FB01>c writer, to my
   knowledge, either in America or Europe (and I have searched
  ‘far and wide for the purpose), has ever had a doubt that the
   camphor deposits are produced by the action of light. Nor do
   I now see any cause to alter one of the conclusions of my paper,
   viz. that the result of Dr. Draper’s labours was “ to multiply
   phenomena, and to leave the theory as it was.”

                  XV. A Theory of the Zodiacal Light.
           By Professor CHALLIS, M./1., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
 THE following theory of the zodiacal light is the same as that
          of which I gave an outline at the Meeting of the British
 Association held in October last at Cambridge. I propose now
 to produce it in more detail, and to exhibit the mathematical
 reasoning by which it is sustained. So far as the facts to be
 explained may be regarded as phenomena of light, reference will
 be made for their explanation to those motions of an elastic <U+FB02>uid
 medium which I have investigated in several recent communica
 tions to this Journal, and have especially applied in the Number
 for last December in the explanation of various properties and
 laws of light. That the zodiacal light, regarded merely as a
 phenomenon of light, comes under the class of phenomena ex
 plained in that communication, which are distinguished from
 those of re<U+FB02>exion, refraction, &c. by not being immediately
 related to visible and tangible substances, will be made to appear
 by reference to direct observations. There are other character
 istics of it, such as its form and position, the proposed explana
 tions of which depend on motions of the aethereal medium differ
 ent in kind from those which account for the properties of light.
 The laws of these motions will be deduced by mathematical in
 vestigation. But it is necessary <U+FB01>rst of all to state distinctly
 the facts and appearances which it is proposed to explain.
     In the northern hemisphere the zodiacal light is seen in the
spring months in the west, after the departure of twilight, as a
very faint light about 12 degrees broad at its base in the horizon,
converging to an apex, and having its axis nearly coincident with
the ecliptic. It is most conspicuous in the months of February
and March, at which season the apex is near the Pleiades. Similar
phenomena are visible before morning twilight in the east in the

118             Prof. Challis on the Zodiacal Light.
autumn months. It is evident that the light seen in the autumn
lies generally in the same direction from the sun as the light
seen in the spring; and as the earth is at these periods in oppo
site parts of its orbit, the appearances would be satis<U+FB01>ed, so far
as regards northern observations, by supposing the light to be
of a conical or pyramidal form with the base near the sun, and
not to be equally and similarly extended in the opposite direc
tion from the sun. To ascertain whether this is really the case,
I wrote, in default of available observations, to ,a friend resident
in the interior of Brazil for information respecting the southern
aspects of the phenomenon, and in a letter dated October 2,
1848, received the answer that he “had frequently remarked,
particularly the last few days, about an hour after sunset, a strong
light in the west, some 10 degrees broad, rising to the height of
50 degreesat least above the horizon, diminishing in breadth,
but not converging to a de<U+FB01>nite point.” This was evidently the
zodiacal light stretching out from the sun just in the opposite
direction to that in which it is seen in northern latitudes. From
this observation it may be inferred that the light is symmetri
cally disposed with reference to the sun, and that it is not visible
in northern latitudes in autumn evenings and spring mornings,
solely because the small inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon
at those epochs brings it into positions in which it must be
viewed through dense parts of the atmosphere, which its light is
too feeble to penetrate. This inference is placed beyond doubt
by the valuable observations of Professor 0. Piazzi Smyth made
at the Cape of Good Hope in the years 1843, 1844, and 184-5,
and communicated in February 1848 to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh (Transactions, vol. xx.       489). About the time of
the solstices the inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon will be
nearly the same in the morning and in the evening hours, -and
consequently the zodiacal light, if seen at all, should be seen
both morning and evening at the June solstice in southern lati
tudes, and at the December solstice in northern latitudes.      Pro
fessor Smyth has in fact recorded observations of the positions
of the apices on June 5 and July 6, 1845, both in the morning
and in the evening. The two apic'es'are situated in opposite
 directions from the un, and the line joining them and conceived
to pass through the sun, will be at right angles to the line simi
larly connecting the apices seen in spring, or in autumn, in
opposite hemispheres. Subsequently to my having knowledge
of the observations above mentioned, I found from a list of ob
servations of the zodiacal light-collected by M. Houzeau, and
published in the Asironomische Nachrichten (vol. xxi. col. 187),
that Cassini had taken morning and evening observations of the
apices on two days not far from the winter solstice, namely, on

                     Prof. Challis on the Zodiacal Light.          119
     January 6 and December 25, 1685.           The line joining these
     apices will be approximately coincident with the line joining the
     apices observed at the Cape near the summer solstice.
        The foregoing observations, taken together with all those col
    lected by M. Houzeau, indicate that the zodiacal light is always
    visible before sunrise and after sunset, whenever the ecliptic
    makes a large angle with the horizon of the place of observation,
    and accord very well with the supposition that its form is that
    of a double convex lens having the sun at its centre, and its
    principal plane inclined at a small angle to the plane of the
    ecliptic. After making the hypothesis that the position of the
    apex in space is always on a straight line through the sun perpen
    dicular to the earth’s radius vector, M. Houzeau has found by
   the method of least squares applied to the <U+FB01>fty-eight positions
   in his list, that the longitude of the node of the principal plane
   is 1° 59', and the inclination to the plane of the ecliptic 3° 35'.
   He has also compared the apparent inclinations to the ecliptic of
   the planes passing through the earth, the sun, and the observed
   positions of the apex, with the corresponding inclinations calcu
   lated from these elements on the above hypothesis. And having
   made the same comparison on the supposition that the principal
  plane coincides with the plane of the sun’s equator, adopting
  75° 8' for the longitude of the ascending node, and 7° 9' for the
  inclination, as determined by M. Laugier (Comptes Rendus,
  vol. xii. p. 649), he <U+FB01>nds that the sum of the squares of the dif
  ferences in the former comparison is to that in the other as 100
  to 121. Notwithstanding that this result seems to be in favour
 of M. Houzeau’s elements, it appears, on inspecting the respective
 differences between the calculated and observed apparent incli
 nations, that the law of the inclinations is not so well represented
 by these elements as by the elements of the sun’s equator. This
 will become still more apparent after correcting the signs of the
 inclinations deduced from the observations taken in the evenings
 of December 25 and January 5, 1685, which by some mistake
 are plus instead of minus. It is also to be considered that the
hypothesis on which the calculations rest is inexact except for
positions of the earth very near the nodes, and that the ten
dency of the error, in the comparison with the elements of the
 sun’s equator, is to augment the plus differences in August and
September, and the minus differences in February and March.
When these circumstances are taken into account, it will be found
that the apparent inclinations corresponding to positions of the
apex on the north side of the ecliptic in the evening and the
south side in the morning, prevail generally from September to
March, and the opposite inclinations during the rest of the year;
which is just what would take place if the nodes of the zodiacal

I20             [Prof. Challis on the Zodiacal I/ighl.
light are coincident with the nodes of the sun’s equator.      In the
same case the maximum apparent inclinations would occur at
June 6 and December 6, which, as will presently be shown, is in
suf<U+FB01>cient accordance with the results of observation; while, ac
cording to M. Houzeau’s elements, about seventeen days before
those epochs the inclinations are at zero.
   In order to test the above inferences, I have calculated the
apparent inclinations from as many observations as I could col
lect of positions of the apex taken within moderate intervals from
June 6 and December 6, and have compared them with the
inclinations, deduced in the manner above stated, from the ele
ments of ‘the sun’s equator. The observations used for this
purpose are fourteen in M. Houzeau’s list from October 26 to
January 8 inclusive; two taken by Prof. Smyth on July 9, 1845
 (those of June 5, which for some reason are wholly discordant,
 being omitted), and <U+FB01>ve taken by Capt. W. S. Jacob in 1862,
on May 17' and 26, and June 11, 16, and 21. These last are con
 tained in the ‘ Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
 Society ’ (vol. xxiii. No. 2, p. 55), in a letter from the observer
 communicated by Prof. Smyth, who has added concluded right
 ascensions and declinations of the apex, which I have adopted.
 Of the four remaining observations by Capt. Jacob, those of July
 16, 17, and 22 were thought to be too uncertain, and that of
July 30 taken advisedly when Venus was behind a cloud, and
giving a consistent result, was considered to be too distant from
the epoch of June 6. The mean of the inclinations given by the
twenty-one observations is 4° 16', and the mean of those deduced
from the elements of the sun’s equator 6° 29'.         The difference,
2° 13', being subtracted from 7° 9', the assumed inclination of
the solar equator, the remainder, 4° 56', may be regarded as the
apparent inclination at the epoch of December 6, and, in fact,
the maximum apparent inclination, very approximately deduced
from the observations, if the nodes are coincident with those of
the sun’s equator. The apparent inclination at the same epoch
by the other elements is 0° 54!, and the maximum apparent incli
nation, occurring at September 25, is 3° 35'. The above differ
ence of 2° 13' may be attributable partly to the rough and un
certain character of the observations, partly to the error of the
hypothesis of the calculations, and partly to error in the determi
nation of the inclination of the solar equator. '1 take the occa
sion to remark that the measures of the positions of solar spots by
which this determination has been made, do not take account of
any displacement of those positions which may be due to the
passage of the rays by which the spots are seen through the
sun’s atmosphere.
   Upon the whole, it may be concluded from the above discus

                   Prof. Challis on the Zodiacall/ight.            121
    sion that the coincidence of the principal plane of the zodiacal
   light with the plane of the sun's equator may be assumed as a.
   probable deduction from observation, till the point he settled by
   additional observations of greater exactness than those hitherto
   made. For greater accuracy, the observations should be taken,
   if possible, by instrumental measurement, rather than by esti
   mation with reference to planets and bright stars. Good obser
   vations of the direction of the axis of the light, made in the
   months of June and December, would most immediately tend to
   decide this question.
      I have now to refer to certain observations of recent date which
   have a bearing on the extent of the zodiacal light. Vol. iv. of
  the ‘Astronomical Journal,’ edited by Dr. Gould, contains, in
  p. 94, a letter dated May 17, 1855, addressed to the editor by
  the Rev. George Jones, Chaplain on board the U.S. steam-frigate
  ‘Mississippi,’ in which he states that in a voyage chie<U+FB02>y in the
  China and Japan seas, and extending from 41° north latitude to
  50° south latitude, he had excellent opportunities for observation
  of the zodiacal light.    The observations are not given in detail,
  but the following important statement is made: “I was also
  fortunate enough to be twice near the latitude of 23° 28' north
  when the sun was at the opposite solstice, in which position the
  observer has the ecliptic at midnight at right angles with his
 horizon, and bearing east and west. Whether the latter circum
 stance a<U+FB02>ected the result or not I cannot say; but I then had
 the extraordinary spectacle of the zodiacal light simultaneously
 at both east and west horizons from 11 to 1 o’clock for several
 nights in succession.” From this observation, of the certainty
 of which there seems to be no reason to doubt, it must be con
 cluded that the zodiacal light extends beyond the radius of the
 earth’s orbit; for otherwise it would have been entirely below
 the horizon of the observer at midnight. Consequently the earth
 is either at all times enveloped by it, or, at least, when passing
 across the line of its nodes. This fact, which stands directly
opposed to the idea which some have entertained that the zodiacal
 light originates in a vast number of minute bodies circulating
about, and descending towards, the sun, necessitates the infer
ence that it is simply luminosity. It will presently appear that
the theory I am now about to propose conducts to the same con
clusion.
     The theory essentially rests on a law of the motion of <U+FB02>uids,
elastic or incompressible, which may be called the law of the
coexistence of steady motions. This law, I venture to predict
will eventually be found to have the same important bearing on
the theories of electricity, galvanism, and magnetism that the
law of the coexistence of small vibrations has in the theory of

 Magnetic Force” contained in the Philosophical Magazine for
February 1861 ; which, as it has probably attracted no attention,
I will here repeat, with some difference in the course of the
argument, and in somewhat more detail.
    The known general hydrodynamical equation applicable to
steady motion when no extraneous force acts, is

is, the resultant of the separate steady motions, supposing them to

being steady, are functions of coordinates only, the resultant
motion must also be a function of coordinates only, and conse
quently be steady motion. Hence the resultant will satisfy the
general equation (I) applicable to steady motion; and as it has
thus been shown that it satis<U+FB01>es both equations, the law of the
coexistence of steady motions is a necessary consequence.
   The application of this hydrodynamical law to the problem of

                         Prof. Challis on the Zodiacal Light.           123
         the zodiacal light depends on the following hypotheses, which are
         the same that I have previously made for the explanation of facts
         of avery different kind. First, I assume the existence of the
        ether, that is, of a uniform elastic <U+FB02>uid pervading space and
        pressing always proportionally to its density. Secondly, the
        ether is assumed to be the medium of the generation and trans
        mission of light, this assumption being abundantly justi<U+FB01>ed by
       the explanations deducible from it of a great variety of pheno
       mena of light, as is shown in the -Number of the Philosophical
       Magazine for last December. Thirdly, the aather is supposed to
       permeate freely all visible and tangible substances, <U+FB01>lling without
       change of its density all the space not occupied by the atoms of
      the substances.
          It is an ascertained fact that the vast body of the sun revolves
      jmiformly about an axis in twenty-<U+FB01>ve days nearly. Without
      inquiring into the particular disturbing effect of this movement
     on the ether, we may with certainty draw from the above hypo
     theses the following inferences, which are all that are necessary
     for my present purpose: (1) that as the disturbing cause is con
     stant, the motion of the aether produced by it is steady ; (2) that
     the motion decreases with increase of distance from the sun, and
     With increase of distance from a plane coincident with that of
    the sun’s equator; (3) that the motion is symmetrical with
    respect to the sun as its centre, and is alike on the two sides of
    the above-mentioned plane.            These inferences are true if the
    8\1n’s centre have a <U+FB01>xed position in space.          But there is good
   reason to conclude, from astronomical observation, that the sun
   and the whole solar system is progressing through space with a
   uniform rectilinear motion. To take account of the effect of
   this motion, we may conceive to be impressed on the aether
  8n'equal contrary motion. The sun will thus be reduced to
  rest, and we shall have the case of two coexistent steady motions
  having independent origins. According to the hydrodynamical
  law proved above, the steady motion caused by the sun’s rotation
  Will not be altered by this circumstance, and will consequently
  be the same when the sun is in motion as if it were at rest.
      It is now important to explain in what manner the coexistence
 Of these steady motions gives rise to the appearance of light.
 This is a theoretical consequence of the analytical circumstance
 that, in the investigation of the law of coexisting steady motions,
terms of the third order were omitted. These terms correspond
to parts of the motion which, so far as they are e<U+FB01>ective, pro
duce disturbances of the aether superadded to the steady motions;
and the disturbances, since they arise from the mutual action of
the parts of the <U+FB02>uid, are productive of light-undulations, accord
ing to the mathematical principles of the undulatory theory of

light which I have so fully explained in the pages of this Journal.
The space through which the disturbances extend will only be
that which is occupied in common by the two steady motions,
which, without doubt, will be of much larger dimensions than the
space from which the light that is of sensible amount comes to
the eye of a spectator.    Evidently, however, the form, position,
and density at different parts of this light will be just such as are
exhibited by the zodiacal light. Its principal plane will coincide
with the plane of the sun’s equator; which condition, as we have
seen, is at least very approximately ful<U+FB01>lled by the phenomenon ;
but, as before stated, the observations are not yet adequate to
decide whether or not it is exactly ful<U+FB01>lled.
   The facts and arguments that have now been adduced may
suffice for giving a distinct idea of the proposed theory of the
zodiacal light, and of the evidence on which it rests. It may
be mentioned as a circumstance con<U+FB01>rmatory of the truth of
the theory, that it essentially depends on the reality of the
movement of the solar system, which movement accounts also
for the observed tendency of the proper motions of stars to mean
directions diverging from a certain point of the heavens. This
reference of widely different phenomena to a common cause is an
instance of that “ consilience,” which is one of Bacon’s tests of
the truth of a theory. But not in this respect alone does the
proposed theory receive such con<U+FB01>rmation. A considerable time
before I had concluded from observations that the form of the
zodiacal light is that which has been described in this commu
nication, I had proposed a theory of magnetic force, in which
the cosmical magnetic in<U+FB02>uence resident in the sun, which has
been so satisfactorily educed by General Sabine from the discus
sion of a large number of magnetic observations, was referred to
those very gyratory motions of the aether about the sun, of which,
according to the present theory, we have ocular evidence in the
zodiacal light. The magnetic theory is expounded in two com
munications contained in the Numbers of the Philosophical
Magazine for January and February 1861, and the particular
applications alluded to are made in articles 34, 35, and 36.        I
take this opportunity of adverting to the theoretical explanation
of General Sabine’s “ semiannual inequality” of the diurnal
variation of the declination, which is given very imperfectly in
art. 35, for the purpose of making an important addition to it,
which will at the same time serve to exhibit in a very distinct
manner the consilience of explanations just spoken of. As this
inequality is, at the same local hours, very nearly of the same
amount at places on the earth’s surface widely different as to
latitude, it would seem to depend only on the earth’s helio
centric longitude.    But since, according to the theory, no semi

             Prof. Emerson on the Perception of Relief.         125
 annual inequality independent of latitude would exist if the sun’s
 equator coincided with the ecliptic, the inequality in question
 must be attributed to the inclination of the solar equator, in
 consequence of which the effect of the gyratory motions about
 the sun will be at a maximum each time the earth passes through
 the nodes, that is, as we have seen, about the times of the summer
 and winter solstices.
    There is another phenomenon similar, and perhaps related to
 the zodiacal light, which is described by Mr. Jones in a second
 letter, dated from Quito, Nov. 18, 1856, and published in vol. v.
 of the ‘Astronomical Journal’ (p. 28). He says, “I see here
 every night, and all through the night, a luminous arch, from
 east to west, quite across the sky.” The arch is also stated to
 be 20 degrees broad, and of uniform intensit throughout ; and
 apparently it stretches along the ecliptic, 0. though this is not
expressly mentioned. The phenomenon described by Prof.
Brorsen of Senftenberg, in Nos. 998 and 1166 of the Astrono
misclze Nachrichten, appears to be identical with this. I have
purposely abstained from any attempt to account for this lumi
nosity, because it seems to require for its explanation considera
tions distinct from those which apply to the zodiacal light,
although, like the latter, it is in some way related to the sun.

                 XVI. On the Perc@ti0n of Relief.
   By Professor EDWIN EMERSON, of Troy University, U.S.*
PROFESSQR CIMA of Turin has sent us the description (says
       the editor of the Cosmos) of a stereoscopic experiment which
is not without interest. He takes the picture of a front view of a
human head, executed either in crayon, or lithograph, or copper
plate, and which is 3 or -'11 centimetres in height; this he cuts
into two parts along a line which coincides with the vertical axis
of the nose; he takes one of these halves in each hand, and hold
ing them in the same perpendicular plane, he brings them before
the eyes at a distance which is less than that of distinct vision;
he then allows the optic axes to converge, and thus causes the
drawings to approach or recede until he is able to see two pictures
of each half, and until the two middle ones overlap so that they
make the impression of an entire countenance. “When one makes
this experiment for the <U+FB01>rst time,” says Professor Cima, “ he will
see with astonishment that the full face which is produced by
the overlapping of the two halves makes, in a high degree, the
impression of a solid body; the half tones melt and mix together

 as in a modelled <U+FB01>gure; the nose rises well from the face ; the
 eyebrows, lips, and chin stand out very well; and the entire
 <U+FB01>gure raises itself from the ground upon which it is drawn, and
 assumes in a remarkable degree a living expression. The neces
 sary distance of the two half-pictures from each other, and also
 the proper distance from the eyes of the observer for the pro
 duction of the greatest elfect, can only be ascertained by trial.
 The more steadily one gazes at the pictures, the more the sensa
 tion of relief is strengthened ”*.
    The foregoing extract from the Cosmos has been reproduced
 in Poggendor<U+FB01>"s Annalen, vol. cii. p. 319; in Il Nuovo Cimento,
 vol.vi.p. 185 ; in Die Theorie des Sehens und riiumliclzen Vorstellen,
 bei Dr. Cornelius, Halle, 186] ; and in Monographie du Stereo
 scope, par Blanchere, Paris, 1862. Seemingly endorsed by such
 a high authority as Moigno, the alleged fact passes through
scienti<U+FB01>c treatises unquestioned, and is now apparently regarded
 as established. We consider it, therefore, important to refute
 the conclusions involved in the experiment as described by Pro
 fessor Cima, and at the same time point out some analogous mis
 takes as to the perception of relief.
    When the experiment of Professor Cima is carefully performed
 and analysed, it will be found that the right eye sees the right
 half of the middle picture, and the left eye the left half. Now, as
 these two dissimilar masses are not superposed upon each other,
 as is the case with the dissimilar complementary <U+FB01>gures in ordi
nary vision, but are merely joined together at the line passing
through the centre of the resultant picture, it is evident that, if
such an effect is realized as that “the nose rises well from the
face,” or that there is any “ sensation of relief,” we have here an
experiment which refutes the established theory of binocular
vision, and leaves the effects of the stereoscope without any
adequate explanation.
    The fact is, however, that in Professor Cima’s experiment
there is no real perception of relief. All that is really seen is
the perspective, which is mistaken for relief or solidity. To
prove this, let the observer, while looking at the two half-pictures
in the mode alleged to produce the effect of solidity, close one
eye, the right for instance; the right half of the picture disap
pears, but the left retains exactly the same appearance it had
before; it loses no appearance of solidity, simply because it had
none. Or let the observer join the two halves together, and
closely and continuously observe them with one eye; the effect
will be the same as in Professor Cima’s experiment. Or, to vary
the test, take a single photographic picture, for instance the
right-hand side of a stereograph, cut it in two by a vertical line

               Prof. Emerson on the Perception afRelief.            127
 through the centre, and place the halves the proper distance
 apart in a stereoscope so as to unite them readily into a whole ;
 the same effect, claimed b Professor Cima to be a sensation of
 relief, will be observed: 1'. at it is not relief will be most mani~
 fest by comparing it with a stereograph of the same scene.
     But the reader will very naturally inquire, How did Professor
 Cima, and those who have unquestioningly quoted his experiment,
 fall into this error with regard to the presence of relief ? This
 reasonable question we will endeavour now to answer.
    The ability to perceive relief, or solidity, is a natural one.   To
 those who have the proper use of their eyes and can walk, it
 is an intuitive faculty; we cannot help seeing solidity, where it
 exists, if we try, no more than we can help hearing sounds or
 seeing colours. The common idea that this faculty is the result
 of experience, and is therefore acquired, is opposed by the whole
 analogy of our being. The infant does not learn to hear; it hears,
it hears intuitively if it is a perfect child, but learns as it grows to
know what it bears ; it feels a blow, but may be too young and
feeble to know what that blow is. So it has but to open its eyes
and the scene enters, it is painted properly and instantaneously
upon the retina; but it may require a long education before the
child will have an intelligent idea of what it sees: indeed it may
go through life and never be able to give more than one name to
a great variety of very different colours, such as red, vermilion,
scarlet, orange, and crimson. It is unphilosophical to confound
a faculty with its use. We have the natural faculty of seeing
solidity; but the acuteness with which it is employed depends
greatly upon the intelligent attention with which it is exercised.
    It is no answer to this to say that we can analyse the optical
conditions upon which the perception of relief depends. This
has been splendidly done by Wheatstone, Dove, and others, and
is beautifully illustrated by the stereoscope; but this has no
necessary connexion with the question before us. When I say
we hear intuitively, it is nothing, in the way of refutation, to
explain to me the acoustic conditions upon which hearing de
pends, or to assert that Mozart had no intuitive perception of
melody or harmony because the laws are <U+FB01>xed by which a melody
ought to proceed, and harmony, to be such, must be according
to the formula of thorough bass, whereas the child Mozart could
not know all this. So with the matter in question; all men see
solidity who have the proper use of their eyes: very few indeed
 know how it is effected, or are able to distinguish acutely
 between the perception of binocular relief and the perception of
mere perspective, or the appearance of distance without relief.
    The perception of reliefdepends upon the angle formed by the
rays which proceed from any object of sight to the right and

128          Prof. Emerson on the Perception ofRelief.
left eyes respectively; the larger this angle, the more relief is
apparent, provided the eyes can unite the dissimilar images; but
when by reason of distance this angle becomes nothing practi
cally, and the rays are parallel as they enter the eyes, relief
vanishes.
   The perception of the perspective depends upon very different
conditions, such as the direction of the lines that compose a view,
the light and shade, the apparent size, the tint, &c.
   When we consider the matter, it is not surprising that these
two modes of perception should often be confounded. True
relief diminishes so gradually, and melts so gently away, leav
ing perspective entirely master of the <U+FB01>eld, that the essential
difference between them is likely to be lost sight of. That this
is the case may be shown by the following examples :—
   It requires a series of very careful experiments to determine
how far, under ordinary conditions, we can perceive relief. Ex
periments of my own lead me to believe that the distance is
under three hundred yards. The only reason a good painting,
whose foreground is represented as it appears at the distance of
two or three hundred yards, is not a complete illusion when seen
 under favourable conditions, is that we can change our point of
view; and motion to one side or the other will impart the idea
of relief in nature, but as there is no relief, properly so called,
in a painting, as soon as we shift the point of view, we detect
this, and the illusion is at an end. Hence paintings ought to be
 observed by one eye, and from one point of view, to obtain the
 maximum effect. Hence, also, stereographs of scenes which lie
 at a distance of over three hundred yards from the observer will
 give no stereoscopic effect, will not give the impression we are
 able to get with our eyes, assisted by our capacity to move from
 one point of view to another; they ought therefore to be
 photographed from stations more or less distant from each
 other, but always exceeding considerably the distance between
 the eyes.
    Persons not accustomed to experimenting with the stereoscope
cannot distinguish readily between stereoscopic and pseudoscopic
effect: they are also constantly imposed upon by views which
have no stereoscopic effect whatever. I have repeatedly mounted
 two identical or right-eye views of the same scene, side by side,
 as though they were right- and left-eye views, and have never
failed to get the verdict that they exhibited stereoscopic effect;
which was impossible, of course. Not only are ordinary obser
vers thus mistaken, but they constantly manifest an opposite
peculiarity, being unable to see the greatest relief when it is
 exhibited in an unusual manner. In Das Stere0scop,C. G. Ruete,
Leipsig, 1860, Dove’s illustration of this point is republished in

       such a way as to destroy the object in view, showing that his
       commentator had not a <U+FB01>ne perception of relief.
         A remarkable instance of the uncertainty attending the per
       ception or non-perception of stereoscopic relief, even in cases
      vvhere we might suppose there could be no want of knowledge,
      is shown by the controversy now going on in Europe over the
      Chimentipicturcs. Sir David Brewster thinks he has in these
      pictures a specimen of real stereoscopic drawings produced about
     the middle of the 17th century; and this opinion is endorsed
     by Prof. Tait, Prof. Macdonald, and others in decided terms.
     Ihave made a careful examination of the photographs of these
     pictures ,- and the truth is that the tri<U+FB02>ing stereoscopic and pseu
     doscopic qualities about them are evidently accidental. To
    prove this, let anyone execute a pen-and-ink sketch, and then
    1% him make as perfect a copy of it as he can without careful
    measurements : now place these two drawings in the stereoscope,
    find you get the same kind of effect seen in the Chimenti draw
   1Ilg8,a_nd for the same reason: the drawings will vary more or
   less from each other; all that is necessary, then, to impose upon
   Ordinary eyes is to <U+FB01>nd out which way the sum of the variations
   Pltponderates ; mount the drawings accordingly, and, mirabile
   dicta! you have produced a stereoscopic picture (the pseudo
   scopic portion being overlooked) drawn by hand ; you have
   done that very thing that Sir David Brewster has repeatedly
   declared was quite beyond human skill! If Prof. Wheatstone
  gets no heavier blow than this, his fame as a discoverer is secure.
       As a further con<U+FB01>rmation of our views, we may point to the
  fact that but few persons can properly locate the optical position
  of re<U+FB01>exions from curved surfaces, and inparticular the images
 from concave surfaces.
      During the last year or two, large assemblages have been
 drawn together in our principal cities to see with delight the
 effects produced by what is called the Stereopticon, which is
 merely another name for a magic lantern of good quality, with
 One side of a glass stereograph for a slide. Nearly all in these
 large assemblages have agreed in believing that they saw, what
 they were told they saw, excellent stereoscopic effect in the single
picture which alone is exhibited.           The truth is they made the
popular mistake; they saw nothing but perspective.
      Stereoscopic effect on a. large scale may be obtained by exhi
biting the right and left pictures of a glass view side by side by
the magic lantern, and then uniting the magni<U+FB01>ed pictures by
means of prisms. This I have recently demonstrated by expe
riment. The idea was also suggested some years ago by Dr
Wolcott Gibbs to Mr. Pike of New York, but not put to the
test.

XVII. New Method of determiningothe Thermal Conductibility of
                 Bodies. By A. J. ANGs'rRoM*.
 TO the properties of matter which have been the subject of
        continuous investigation, the thermal conductibility of the
metals undoubtedly belongs; but our knowledge of this import
 ant element is by no means so accurate or complete as we are
 entitled to expect, and the following contribution may therefore
not be uninteresting.
    The methods hitherto used for determining the conducting
power are especially two. It has either been attempted, starting
 from the formula
                                 u — u’
                              lc  Ax=Q,......(1)
to determine the heat which traverses a metal screen of the
thickness Ax, when its two surfaces have the temperatures 14
and u' ; or the distribution of heat has been observed in a
metal bar of constant temperature, the di<U+FB02>erential formula
                          dgu      h

<U+FB01>rst proposed by Biot, being taken as a basis; in which case, as
well as in what follows, u indicates the temperature of a given
point of the bar, 11 the radiating power,of the surface, k the
conducting power, p the perimeter of the bar, and w its section.
    The <U+FB01>rst method appears to promise no great accuracy, and,
from a theoretical point of view, is not unobjectionable. For if
both surfaces are kept at a given temperature by contact with
steam or water, the conducting power of the metal screen, or,
more correctly, the value of Q, is modi<U+FB01>ed to such an extent that,
as Péclet has found, the difference between various metals quite
disappears in comparison with the small conductibility which
water possesses. Péclet has endeavoured to obviate this error
by renewing, by means of a special apparatus, the layer of water
in contact with both surfaces as often as 1600 times in a minute.

   Besides which it appears to me that a rotating apparatus which
   rubs with such velocity will itself produce heat, and hence com
   plicate or extinguish the phenomenon which is to be investigated.
   The results, also, to which various experimenters have attained
   by the formula (1) by no means agree.
      If as unity the quantity of heat is taken which heats 1 kilo
   gramme of water 1° (3., there passes in a second through a copper
   disc of 1 square metre super<U+FB01>cies and 1 millim. in thickness,

  The last value, which so considerably exceeds the <U+FB01>rst two, is
  yet, as is clear from what follows, still considerably too small.
     According to the latter method, which depends upon the ap
 plication of the formula (2), the process has been as follows:
  bars of the substance to be investigated have been procured and
 have been heated at one end until the temperature had become
 stationary, and the temperature of the bar investigated at dif
 ferent parts, either by thermometers, or by the contact of a
 thermo-electric element. This method gives greater accuracy
 than the foregoing, but labours under the defect that it does
 not give the value of is separately, but only the ratio between h
 and k, by which means the value of the latter magnitude is
 expressed in a function, namely, that of the radiation from the
 surface, which is not known. Hence it is that the value of /I is
 Variable, and depends not only on the difference from the tem
 perature of the space, but also on the absolute temperature of the
 bar, as Dulong and Petit’s investigations on the law of cooling
 have shown; it is thus evident that in this way only relative
 values of the conducting power of the various bodies can be
 obtained—and only this under the supposition that the bars
 retain the same surface, and the observations be made between
the same limits of temperature. Principally by taking these
circumstances into account, have Wiedemann and Franz obtained
concordant results in their valuable investigation.
    Besides the above methods, others have been used which may
be called mixed, like that of Tyndall for the conducting power of
different kinds of wood, or that of Calvert and Johnson for
metallic alloys. For these experiments short bars of the sub
stances in question were used. They were heated at one end,
and the heat observed which during a given time they imparted
to a mass of mercury or water surrounding the other. Since in
this case, as has been already remarked in reference to the <U+FB01>rst

                                    § 2.
    From what has been said, it is clear that a method for the
determination of the value of k is needed by which this shall be
expressed in known magnitudes, or at any rate in such as are
more easily determined than the radiation from the surface. I
think I have found such a method by using a general formula
for the propagation of heat in a bar of parallelopipedal form,
-that is,

    If a metal bar be taken so long that, in determining the law
 of the propagation of heat in it, regard need not be had to its
 terminal faces, and if it is heated or cooled during <U+FB01>xed periods, its
 periodical changes of temperature must be transmitted along the
 entire bar; and hence, in consequence of radiation from the sur
 face, not only will the amplitudes diminish, but the maxima and
 minima will occur later at a greater distance from the points of
 heating. If we suppose these periodical heatings and coolings
 su<U+FB02>iciently long continued, so that the periods can develope
 themselves completely, in which case the mean temperature of a
 given point of the bar acquires a constant value, equation (3) is

     To show the application of this formula (4), let T=24f, and
  assume that the_bar is heated during half this time, and cooled
  during the other half, and this process continued so long that
 the changes become regular. If now for each minute during one
 or more of these periods the temperature of the bar at a given
 point is observed, for which it can be assumed that .z'=O, these
 observations, calculated according to the method of least squares,
 must be expressed by the following formula :—
         u,,=m,+AI sin (15°n+/3)+B, sin (30° n+/3')
                  +C,sin(4=5°n+,8")+....             . . .  .   .  (5)
 For an analogous point of the bar, corresponding to .z'=1, an
 entirely analogous formula is obtained :—

a result remarkable for its simplicity. If in formula (7) the

It is then seen that H entirely disappears from the expression
for air’, so that the value of k is obtained expressed in the speci<U+FB01>c
heat of the body, reduced to the unit of volume, and indepen
dent of the numerous changes to which the radiating power is
subject.
    As now the speci<U+FB01>c heat is one of the elements most accurately
known, and which may be determined with the greatest accuracy,
there is a possibility of obtaining the absolute value of /c.

from them must, from readily explicable causes, be less reliable.
    By altering the length of the periods, the accuracy of the
values obtained for k may be controlled ; k might also be obtained
if a were known for two different periods, Tl and T», without
needing the on’.

 tageous than the preceding one (8).
                                      3. in its application.
    The utility of a method is bes§t seen                         I there
 fore give a short account of ome experiments which were made
 on the conductibility in copper and iron.
     To determine the temperature, I preferred to use thermome
 ters, but of very small dimensions, sunk in the bar itself. To
 determine the temperature of the bar on the surface itself by a
 thermo-electric pile, as Langberg and subsequently Wiedemann
 and Franz have done, can scarcely be applied in any other cases
 than those in which the bars are very thin, which, however, is
 not advantageous for the method.
     Besides, in the passage of heat from the bar to the thermo
 electric element irregularities arise in the transmission of heat,
 which are quite comparable to those which might result from
 the cavities in the bar.
     The thermometers had cylindrical reservoirs 1'5 to 2'0 mil
 lims. in diameter, and 15 millims. in length ; they were provided
 with arbitrary scales, and were read off by means of telescopes.
     The thickness (,1; p) of the bars was 2375 millims., and the
  cavities, at a distance of 50 millims. from each other, were 2'25
  millims. in diameter. As these bars were originally intended for
  an altogether different investigation, they could be screwed to
  gether in a special apparatus; and thus the two united copper
 bars were 570 millims. in length.
     The heating and cooling of the bar could be effected by alter
 nately surrounding it with aqueous vapour from the boiler A,
 or with cold water from the vessel B*; this was effected by
    * In observing the iron bar, the cooling was not effected by the use of
 cold water, but simply by radiation.

  turning the cock 6, which in the position b, allowed steam, and
  in the position bQ cold water, to reach the bar, the section of which
  is indicated in the <U+FB01>gure by a.
    By a special investigation the following relations were obtained
 between the divisions of the thermometers used :—
               log 111°: log n4° — O'18253
               log n,°=1og nQ° + O'O2120
               log 119°: log n4°—0'2O-373 . . . . . . (10)
               log n °=log n,°—O'O3685
               log n30 =log n1°—O'O1565
in which n|° denotes the 12° of the thermometer No. 1, n4° the
n° of the thermometer No. 4, and so on.
    The absolute temperature of the bar needs only be known in
so far as it is necessary to calculate the mean temperature, that
is, the temperature to which the <U+FB01>nal value of It refers; other
wise it is enough to know the relative values of the degrees of
the thermometer, and even this is not necessary if in the obser
vation the places of the thermometers are changed.
   By a similar change another source of error is avoided. For
as glass is a bad conductor, it may be foreseen that the ther
mometers do not instantaneously and completely indicate the
temperature of the bar at a given moment; it may, however, be
assumed that these small deviations will occur in an entirely
analogous manner when both thermometers are simultaneously
observed, and that if, in consequence of the unequal form, mass,
&c. of the thermometer-bulbs, a difference occurs, this can be
eliminated by the exchange just mentioned.           A third source of

 136           M. A. J. Angstrom on a New Method of
error, depending on the so-called personal equation in different
observers, can of course be removed from the results 111 a
 similar manner.
                                    § 4.
    After these observations I give in Tables I. and II. the ob
 servations, or rather the mean values calculated from them.
 Each observation is the mean of observations during 2 to 5 pe
 riods, in which the readings of the thermometers made before
 the periods were complete and had assumed a constant character
were always excluded from the calculation of the mean *.           _
    Although in general the coef<U+FB01>cients of the members which
 contain the double and threefold angle are so small that there
 can be no hope of obtaining from them a reliable value of 1:,
 they yet furnish an interesting con<U+FB01>rmation of the theory,
 and hence deserve to be adduced.
    If the respective coe<U+FB02>icients in No. 1 and No. 2 are divided
 by one another, the quotients obtained multiplied, and the
 square root extracted, we get

which values are quite independent of the values of the scales of
the thermometers used.
    If, further, the respective angular measures are subtracted from
one another, we get

   From the quotients obtained, the relation between the con

   As it may not be uninteresting to know also the conductibility
of different soils, I have endeavoured to use the results obtained
from the observations made in Upsala with the earth thermo
meter to ascertain the conductibility of those layers in which
the thermometer was sunk.
   From the observations* were obtained
           ;_ {O'O'/"0282 with 4 and 6 feet thermometer
           1- 0068996 with 6 and 10 feet thermometer.
In this case the Swedish foot and the year are taken as units; if
instead of them the centimetre and minute are introduced, we get

The highest layer in which the thermometers were immersed,
consisted of a mixture of sand and clay; the lower (5 to 10 feet)
of moist clay, which, on being heated, lost 19 per cent. of its
weight. The speci<U+FB01>c gravity and speci<U+FB01>c heat were found by a
determination to be

If it be assumed that the mean temperature of the earth’s layers
decreases about 1° C. for 30 metres of depth, and the con
ducting-power is equal to the value obtained for k, we can easily
calculate the loss of heat of the earth’s surface during a year.
Suppose the earth covered with a layer of water 282'5 millims. in
height, the heat communicated to it by the internal layers during
a year would be enough to raise the temperature of this aqueous
layer by 1° C.

                        By Professor H. Ross 1-.
 THE numerous analyses of this remarkable mineral which
         have been made in my laboratory do not agree very well
 in their results. Whilst M. von Peretz found in three analyses
 1416, 1670, and 1677 per cent. of oxide of uranium, the
 amount of this oxide, according to Chandler, is 17'87 and 20-56
 per cent. The former found 9'15, 1104, and 8'36 per cent. of
 yttria ; the latter only 5'10 and 4'72 per cent.
     This want of agreement proceeds from the defective methods
 employed in the separation of several of the constituents. The
 separation of the peroxides of uranium and iron from the yttria
 was effected by means of carbonate of baryta-—a mode of separa
 tion of which I subsequently ascertained that it gives no certain
results, as it is dif<U+FB01>cult to avoid throwing down yttria together
with the precipitated oxides. This is the reason why the
amount of yttria appeared so small in Chandler’s analyses.
The separation may, however, be well effected by means of
oxalic acid.

posed in the ordinary mode by fusion with bisulphate of potash,
the acids of niobium and tantalum are, indeed, very well sepa
rated by treatment of the fused mass with water; but if the
separated metallic acids are not examined with the greatest care,
errors may be fallen into ; for these acids may be contaminated
with many substances, the presence of which in them may often
be unsuspected. It is well known that they always contain no
inconsiderable quantities of peroxide-of iron, which cannot be
separated from them by acids, but only by converting it into
sulphide of iron by sulphide of ammonium, and dissolving the
latter in very dilute hydrochloric acid, during which process
there is always danger of dissolving at the same time a small
quantity of the metallic acids, especially tantalic acid. As per
oxide of iron, after fusion with bisulphate of potash, dissolves
completely, although slowly, in water, it is the tantalic acid and
the acids of niobium which, after they have lost their sulphuric
acid by ignition, expel the sulphuric acid from the sulphate of
iron, and combine to form salts, from which the peroxide of
iron cannot be extracted by dilute acids, but only by heating
with concentrated sulphuric acid. It is only strong bases, from
the compounds of which with sulphuric acid, tantalic acid and
the acids of niobium are incapable of expelling the sulphuric
acid, that can be perfectly separated from the above-mentioned
acids by fusion with bisulphate of potash.
   Other oxides, as well as peroxide of iron, may remain un
dissolved during the treatment of the mineral fused with bisul
phate of potash with water, and not only weakly basic oxides,
but also such as form compounds with sulphuric acid or with
sulphate of potash, which are insoluble or di<U+FB01>icult of solution,
especially in the solution of sulphate of potash, or,. if they are
soluble in sulphuric acid at ordinary temperatures, separate
from the solution when heated, or on the addition of a large
quantity of water. Of this kind are silicic acid, stannic acid,
zirconia, thorina, tungstic acid, titanic acid, and also the oxide
of cerium (and those of lanthanium and didymium). From
many of these oxides it is difficult to separate the acids of
niobium and tantalum by decomposition with bisulphate of
potash; and if they are not particularly sought for, or their
presence is not suspected, they may readily escape detection.
Zirconia and thorina, especially, may either be entirely over
looked, or their quantity incorrectly determined in the analysis
of minerals containing tantalum and niobium, if these are de
composed by fusion with bisulphate of potash. Baryta, strontia,
and oxide of lead (the latter at least not in appreciable quan
tities) have not hitherto been found in those minerals, but their
separation also would be attended with no small di<U+FB02>iculty.

  144-     Prof. H. Rose on the Composition of Samarslcite.
     When, therefore, the composition of minerals containing tan
  talum, and especially niobium, has not been thoroughly ascer
  tained by experiment, it is as well to give up altogether the
 decomposition by bisulphate of potash, and to effect the decom
 position by potash. By this means the zirconia and thorina, as
 also titanic acid and oxide of cerium, which are insoluble in an
 excess of potash, may be separated from the acids of tantalum,
 and especially of niobium, which dissolve as. potash salts, are
 readily soluble in an excess of potash, and can only be contami
 nated with tungstic acid and stannic acid, from which they are
 easily separated, and also by silica. The decomposition is best
 effected by fusion with hydrate of potash. As, however, this
 must take place in a silver crucible, the employment of which is
 attended by many inconveniences, and by which a contami
 nation of the fused mass with oxide of silver cannot be avoided,
 it is more advisable to employ carbonate of potash, with which
 the mineral may be fused in the platinum crucible. If the
 fusion be effected at <U+FB01>rst over a lamp, and then only for a short
 time with a small blast, the decomposition is perfect.
    I had a particular interest in establishing the correct compo
 sition of Samarskite, as I had been furnished, by the liberality of
 M. von Samarski, with a very large quantity of this rare mineral
for investigation. The mineral also is interesting in many re
spects. As the analyses of Samarskite made in my laboratory
differ so considerably from each other, I induced M. Finkener to
repeat the analysis of the mineral; and only by his invincible
 perseverance has it been possible, notwithstanding the partly
imperfect methods of separation, to arrive at satisfactory results,
and detect substances previously overlooked.
    After the decomposition of the mineral by carbonate of potash,
and the treatment of the fused mass with water, the hypo
niobic acid was precipitated from the solution by sulphuric acid,
and separated from small quantities of tungstic and stannic
acids. Small quantities of peroxide of copper were precipitated
from the solution by sulphuretted hydrogen; the solution was
then slightly supersaturated with ammonia, and the bases, except
lime and magnesia, were thrown down by sulphide of ammo
nium, partly as oxides, partly as sulphides. From the solution
of these in hydrochloric acid, after saturation with ammonia,
the oxides were again precipitated by carbonate of ammonia and
sulphide of ammonium, and only oxide of uranium was dissolved ;
this, as appeared on examination, contained zirconia. The sepa
ration of these is attended with great di<U+FB02>iculty, and could only
be effected by neutralizing the solution in sulphuric acid by
ammonia and boiling it, when zirconia, containing, however,
oxide of uranium, was precipitated, and the greater part of the

                            Royal Society.                       145
oxide of uranium, although contaminated with a little zirconia,
remained in solution. It was only by the repetition of this pro
cess that a separation could be effected.
    From the solution of the precipitated oxides and sulphides in
 nitromuriatic acid, after neutralization with ammonia, oxalate
 of ammonia precipitated yttria and the oxides of cerium, whilst
peroxide of iron and protoxide of manganese remained in solu
 tion. The precipitate produced by oxalic acid was dissolved in
 sulphuric acid, the excess of the latter driven off, and the
residue dissolved in water. This solution, when concentrated,
exhibited the property of depositing a crystalline salt when
heated, which again dissolved on cooling—a property by which,
as is well known, thorina is distinguished. But its separation
from the oxides of cerium, as also from small quantities of zir
conia, was very difficult, and could only be approximately effected,
partly by adding to the solution of the oxalates so much hydro
chloric acid that only the oxalates of protoxide of cerium and
yttria dissolved, and oxalate of thorina (which, of all the oxides
precipitated by oxalic acid, is most difficult of solution in hydro
chloric acid) remained undissolved, and partly by treating the
oxalates with a solution of acetate of ammonia, to which a little
free acetic acid had been added, in which oxalate of thorina dis
solves readily, but the other oxalates with di<U+FB01>iculty.
    In order to obtain a certain result,I had the analysis repeated
once more by Mr. Stephens. The found quantities of thorina
and zirconia agreed in the two analyses more closely than could
have been expected, as the two substances could only be sepa
rated by imperfect methods. Finkener obtained 4'35 per cent.,
and Stephens 4'25 per cent. of zirconia; the former 6'05 per
cent., the latter 5'55 per cent. of thorina.
    To the rare bodies which had already been found in Samars
kite, we have, therefore, according to these analyses, to add
zirconia and thorina. Except in Berzelius’s thorite, the latter
has hitherto been found only in monazite by Kcrsten, and in
pyrochlore by VV6hler; the latter mineral also contains niobium.
It is, however, to be expected that thorina will be found in
other tantaliferous and niobiferous minerals.

     The following communication was read :
     “ Appendix to the Account of the Earthquake-wave Experiments
  made at Holyhead.”      By Robert Mallet, Esq., G.E., F.R.S.
     This communication contributes the sequel of the author's “ Re
  port on Earthquake-Wave Experiments ’ (made at Holyhead),
  as published in part 3 of the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’ for
  1861. At the conclusion of that paper the author expressed his
  hope of being able soon to lay before the Royal Society some experi
  ments for the determination of the modulus of elasticity of perfectly
  solid portions of both the slate and the quartz rock formation
  through which his wave-transit experiments had been made at Holy
  head, with a view to throw light upon the relations between the
  theoretic velocity of transmission (if the rocks were all solid and
  homogeneous) and the actual velocity as determined by experimellt.
     He has now determined the elastic modulus for both rocks, and
  for each rock in two directions, viz. parallel to and transverse to its
 lamination; and he has extended his determinations to specimens of
  each rock of maximum and of minimum compactness and hardness,
 so that the series of experiments upon the compressibility of these
 rocks (from which the modulus is derived) assumes the following
 divarication, viz. :—

 Involving tllus eight distinct series of experiments.
    The compressions were conducted at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich,
 by the aid of the excellent American machine belonging to the Royal
 Gun-factories, permission to use which was accorded to the author.
    The specimens of rock submitted to pressure were all equal cubes
 of 0"/'07 inch on the edge, presenting thus a surface on each side
 of On’) square inch—a dimension presenting facilities for tabular
reduction, &c.
    The .cubes were cut from the chosen rock specimens (selected with
 care as fairly representative) by means of the lapidary's wheel, and
 had opposite faces rigidly parallel and equal.
    The pressures advanced by 1000 lbs. per square inch of surface,
from zero up to the crushing point of the specimen; and at each
advance the actual compression of the column of rock was measured
by instrumental arrangements that admitted of reading space to
'0005 of an inch. The results are given in Tables numbered 1 to 8,
refeged to above, and these are compared in two Tables numbered
9 an 10.

    tolerably uniform.
        The discussion of these Tables fully presents some interesting and
    novelresults.              - ’
         Generally the quartz rock is less compressible than the slate; the
    softest quartz, however, is much more compressible than the softest
    slate in a direction parallel to the lamination of both.                In this di-
    rection also the hardest slate is more than double as compressible as
     the hardest quartz. Transverse to the lamination, however, both the
    hardest slate and quartz have nearly the same coefficient of compres
     sibility, which is very small for both. In the latter direction also
     the softest slate and quartz have almost the same coei<U+FB01>cient, but one
     about four times as great as for the hardest like rocks.
         The author points out several conclusions of much interest dedu
     cible from these experiments as to the physical and geological con
     ditions under which these rocks were formed and consolidated. The
     compression by natural forces has already been greatest in directions
     transverse to the lamination. The great compressibility in the op
    posite directions, or parallel to the lamination, appears to arise chie<U+FB02>y
     from the mass of the rock being made up of minute wedge-shaped
     mineral particles, deposited all with their largest dimensions on the
     plane of lamination, and so acting on each other like wedges.
         Some curious circumstances in the mode of giving way of the rocks
     under pressure are shown by the author to be probably connected
     with their mass being formed of an aggregate of several simple
     minerals.                                 _
         He points out the great differences in wave-transmissive power in
     directions transverse to and parallel to the lamination which these ex
     periments disclose.           The speci<U+FB01>c gravities of the several specimens
  - of rock are then given, ‘to enable the modulus of elasticity to be ob
     tained in feet, and the general results of the experiments are com
     prised in the following Table (p. 148) :
          The author then proceeds to apply these results to the comparison
      of the theoretic and actual transit-periods of the wave of impulse.
          The general expression for elastic wave-propagation in a homo
     geneous medium may be expressed by an equation of the form

  value of V differs from this, we may express it _by the same form of

 rocks, taken together, was to the theoretic velocity due to their mate
 rials, if perfectly solid,

 so that nearly eight-ninths of the full velocity of wave-transmission
 due to the solid material is lost by reason of the heterogeneity and
 discontinuity or shattering of the rocky mass as it is piled together
 in nature.
     The author then shows that were the rocks quite solid, the velo
 city of wave-transmission would be—
     Mean of slate and quartz transverse to lamination V=l3,7l5 feet
 per second.
     Mean of slate and quartz parallel to lamination V=7659 feet per
 second.
     This difference is probably reversed in nature by reason of the
 greater discontinuity in the former direction. The author then
 shows that his results, which appear at <U+FB01>rst sight to con<U+FB02>ict with
 those of an analogous character obtained by Helmholtz and others
for wood, in the three principal directions of its section, are strictly in
 accordance and analogy with the results of these experimenters.
    The author concludes by deducing some conclusions as to the
bearing power, safe load, and proper direction as to lamination when
 exposed to pressure, of these rocks, of a practical character, and valu
able to the civil engineer or architect.

and moon to such an extent as to very sensibly diminish the actual
phenomena of the tides, and of precession and nutation. Results of
a mathematical theory of the deformation of elastic spheroids, to be
communicated to the Royal Society on an early occasion, are used
to illustrate this subject. For instance, it is shown that a homoge
neous incompressible elastic spheroid of the same mass and volume
as the earth, would, if of the same rigidity as glass. yield about %,
or if of the, same rigidity as steel, about %- of the extent that
a perfectly <U+FB02>uid globe of the same density would yield to the
lunar and solar tide-generating in<U+FB02>uence. The actual phenomena
of tides (that is, the relative motions of a comparatively light liquid
<U+FB02>owing over the outer surface of the solid substance of the earth),
and the amounts of precession and nutation, would in the one case be
only %, and in the other of the amounts which a perfectly rigid
spheroid of the same dimensions, the same <U+FB01>gure, the same homoge
neous density, would exhibit in the same circumstances.                The close
agreement with the results of observation presented by the theory of
precession and nutation, always hitherto worked out on the suppo
sition that the solid parts of the earth are perfectly rigid, renders it
scarcely possible to admit that there can be any such discrepance
between them as 3 to 5, and therefore almost necessary to conclude
that the earth is on the whole much more rigid than steel. But to
make an accurate comparison between theory and observation, as to
precession, it is necessary to know the absolute amount of the
moment of inertia about some diameter; and from this we are pre
vented by the ignorance in which we must always be as to the actual
law of density in the interior. Hence the author anticipates that the
actual deformation of the solid earth by the lunar and solar in<U+FB02>uence
may be more decisively tested by observing the lunar fortnightly and
the solar half-yearly tides*. These tides, it may be supposed, will
follow very closely the “equilibrium theory” of Daniel Bernouilli
for all oceanic stations, and the author suggests Iceland and Tene
ritfe as two stations well adapted for the differential observations that
would be required.                                                               '
    The earth’s upper crust is possibly on the whole as rigid as glass,
more probably less than more.            But even the imperfect data for
judging referred to above, render it certain that the earth as a whole
must be far more rigid than glass, and probably even more rigid than
steel. Hence the interior must be on the whole more rigid, probably‘
many times more rigid, than the upper crust. This is just what, if
the whole interior of the earth is solid, might be expected, when the
enormous pressure in the interior is considered; but it is utterly
inconsistent with the hypothesis held by so many geologists that the
earth is a mass of melted matter enclosed in a solid shell of only
from 30 to 100 miles thickness. Hence the investigations now
brought forward confirm the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Hopkins,
   * High tide, as far as the in<U+FB02>uence of either body is concerned, is produced at
the poles, and low (average) water at the equator, when its declination, whether
north or south, is greatest, and low water at the poles and high water at the
 equator, when the disturbing body crosses the plane of the equator.

that the solid crust of the earth cannot be less than 800 miles thick.
The author indeed believes it to be extremely improbable that any
crust thinner than 2000 or 2500 miles could maintain its <U+FB01>gure with
sufficient rigidity against the tide-generating forces of the sun and
moon, to allow the phenomena of the ocean tides and of precession
and nutation to be as they are.
   “On the Difference in the Properties of Hot-rolled and Cold
rolled Malleable Iron, as regards the power of receiving and retaining
Induced Magnetism of Subpermanent Character.” By George Bid
dell Airy, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
   The author states‘ that he had been desirous of examining whether
differences in the degree of change of subpermanent magnetism, such
as are exhibited by different iron ships, might not depend on the
temperature at which the iron is rolled in the last process of its
manufacture.     By the good o<U+FB01>ices of Mr. Fairbairn he had received
gratuitously from Richard Smith, Esq., Superintendent of Lord
Dudle_v‘s Iron Works at the Round Oak Works near Dudley, twenty
four plates of iron, each 16 inches long, 4 inches broad, and 7} inch
thick; twelve of which, after having been manufactured with the
others in the usual way, had been passed through rollers when quite
cold. Each set of twelve was divided into two parcels of six each,
one parcel being cut with the length of the bars in the length of
extension of the <U+FB01>bres of the iron, the other being cut with the
length of the bars transverse to the length of extension.
   For experimenting on these, a large wooden frame was prepared,
capable of receiving the 24 bars at once, either on a plane transverse
to the direction of dip at Greenwich, or on a plane including the
direction of dip. In some experiments, these planes were covered
with <U+FB02>aw-stones, and the bars were laid upon the <U+FB02>ag-stones; in
others, the bars were laid immediately upon the wood. While there
lying, they were struck with iron or wooden hammers of different
sizes. The bars of the different classes were systematically inter
mingled, in such a way that no tendency of the arm to give blows of
a different force or kind in special parts of the series could produce
a class-error in the result. For examination of the amount of polar
magnetism in each bar, it was placed at a de<U+FB01>nite distance (5 inches)
below a prismatic compass, which was used to observe the apparent
azimuth of a <U+FB01>xed mark; the bar was then reversed in length, and
the observation was repeated in that state.
   The number of-experiments was 21. They were varied by differ
ence in the succession of positions of the bars, difference of time
allowed for rest, difference in the violence of the blows, &c.
   The principal results appear to be the following :-—
  _l. The greatest amount of magnetism which a. bar can receive,
appears to be such as will produce (on the average of bars) a com
pass-deviation of about 11°, the bar being 5 inches below the com
pass. It was indifferent whether the bars rested on stone or on
wood, or whether they were struck with iron or with wood, the bars
lying on the dip plane while struck.

  152                        Royal Society :—
      2. When the bars, thus charged, lay on the plane transverse to
  the dip, they lost about one-<U+FB01>fth of their magnetism in one or two
  days, and lost very little afterwards.
     3. When the charge of magnetism is smaller than the maximum,
  the diminution in a day or two is nearly in the same proportion as
  for the maximum.
     4. The effect of violence on the bars, when lying on the plane
  transverse to the dip, is not in all cases to destroy the magnetism
  completely, sometimes it increases the magnetism.
     5. The Cold-Rolled Iron receives (under similar violence) or parts
  with (under similar violence) a greater amount of magnetism than
  the Hot-Rolled Iron, in the proportion of 6 to 5.
     6. There is some reason to think that the Hot-Rolled Iron has a
 greater tendency to retain its primitive magnetism than the Cold
 Rolled Iron has.
     7. There is some reason to think that, when lying tranquil, the
 Hot-Rolled Iron loses a larger portion of its magnetism than the
 Cold-Rolled Iron loses in the same time.

 Esq., F.R.S.

    The following communication was read :
    “ On the Constitution of Sea-water, at different Depths, and in
 different Latitudes.” By George Forchhammer, Ph.D., Professor
of Mineralogy in the University of Copenhagen.
    Professor Forchhammer was present at the Meeting, and, by request
of the President, gave a statement of the principal results of his re
 searches. He <U+FB01>rst, however, took occasion to express his great
 satisfaction in being allowed the opportunity of personally and grate
 fully acknowledging the liberality with which men of science in this
 country had entered into his views and supplied him with specimens
requisite for carrying on his inquiries ; and he particularly mentioned
the name of a late distinguished Fellow of this Society, Sir James
Clark Ross, who had kindly furnished various samples of sea-water
procured in his Antarctic voyage.
    The number of elements hitherto found in sea-water the author
stated to be thirty-one, viz. Oxygen, Hydrogen, Azote in ammonia,
Carbon in carbonic acid, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine in fuci, Fluorine
in combination with calcium, Sulphur as sulphuric acid, Phosphorus
as phosphoric acid, Silicium as silica, Boron as boracic acid, discovered
by the author both in sea-water and in sea-weeds, Silver in the Po
cillopora alcicornis, Copper very frequent both in animals and plants
of the sea, Lead very frequent in marine organisms, Zinc principally
in sea-plants, Cobalt and Nickel in sea-plants, Iron, Manganese, Alu
minium, Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium and Barium, the latter two
as sulphates in fucoid plants, Sodium, Potassium. These twenty
seven elements the author himself had ascertained to occur in sea
water; the presence of the next four elements, viz. Lithium, Cesium,
Rubidium, and Arsenic, has been shown by other chemists.

        Dr. Forchhammer on the Constitution of Sea-water.            153
 ‘ Of these elements only a few occur in such quantity that their
  determination has any notable in<U+FB02>uence on the quantitative analysis
 of sea-water, viz. Chlorine, Sulphuric acid, Magnesia, Lime, Potash,
 and Soda. The others, as far as their existence has been determined
 in the sea-water itself, are found in the residue which remains after
 evaporation to dryness and redissolution of the salts in water.
    The author next stated that in the water of the ocean far from the
 shores the principal ingredients always occur very nearly in the same
 proportions. If we assume chlorine=100, the mean proportion of
 the other leading constituents is as follows :
                            Mean proportion. Maximum.       Minimum.
       Sulphuric acid . .         l1'89        l2'09          1l'65
       Lime . . . .          ..    2‘96         3'16           2'87
       Magnesia. . . . . . . .    11'07        l1'28          lO'95
       All salts . . . . . . .. 18l'l         l8l'4          180'6
    These proportions apply only to specimens obtained at a long di
 stance from shores, or in the open ocean.         In the interior of the
 Baltic, for instance, the proportion of chlorine to sulphuric acid is as
 100 to l4'97—to lime as 100 to 7'48; and the proportion of chlo
 rine to all salts as 100 to 223'0. This constant proportion of the
 different constituents in the ocean depends evidently not upon any
 chemical combination and a<U+FB01>inity between the different substances,
 but upon the enormous quantity of salts in the whole ocean, which
renders imperceptible any di<U+FB01>'erence that might otherwise arise from
 the different proportion in which salts are carried into the sea by
 rivers. It depends, besides, on the uniform action of the numberless
 organic beings inhabiting the ocean which abstract sulphuric acid,
 lime, potash, and magnesia from the water, and render them inso
luble.
    The mean quantity of solid matter in the water of the ocean gene
rally, the author found to be 34'304 per 1000. To determine this
mean quantity he has divided the ocean into regions, viz. :—
    lst Region. Atlantic, from the Equator to 30° N. lat. ; mean
36' 169.
    2nd Region. Atlantic, from 30° N. lat. to a line from the north
of Scotland to the north of Newfoundland; mean 35'9'/'6.
   3rd Region. From the northern boundary of region 2 to the south
coast of Greenland ; mean 35'556.                    _
    4th Region. Davis’s Strait and Ba<U+FB01>‘in’s Bay; mean 33'l6'/'.
    5th Region.      Atlantic, between 0 and 30° S. lat.; mean 36'472.
    6th Region. Atlantic, between 30° S. lat. and a. line from the
southernmost point of Africa to the southernmost point of America;
mean 35'038.
    7th Region.      Between Africa and the East Indian Islands; mean
33'868.
   8th Region.       Between the East Indian and the Aleutic Islands ;
mean 33'506.
    9th Region. Between the Aleutic and the Society Islands; mean
35'2l9.

   154                  -     Royal Society.
       10th Region. The Patagonian stream of cold water ; mean 33'966.
       11th. The Antarctic region ; mean 282563.
      Besides these regions of the great ocean, the author enumerates
   some other regions, which are under the decided in<U+FB02>uence of the
   surrounding land.      Such are the North Sea, with a mean quantity
   of solid matter of 32806 per 1000; the Kattegat and Sound, with
   a mean of l5'l26 ; the Baltic, mean 4'807; the Mediterranean,
   mean about 37‘5 ; the Black Sea, mean l5'894. Of the proportion
   in the large bays of America the author had only one observation,
   viz. in water from the Caribbean Sea, in which the quantity of saline
   matter was found to be 36104 per 1000.
      The author then showed that the equatorial regions contain the
   greatest percentage of saline matter, and that this peculiarity is
   owing to the evaporation under and in the neighbourhood of the line
   being greater than the quantity of water supplied by the rain falling on
   the sea and by the rivers <U+FB02>owing from the land; that the equilibrium
   is maintained by polar currents, which bring water with less saline
   matter to the equatorial regions. The mean quantity of saline in
   gredients in the equatorial regions of the ocean is a out 362 per
    1000, while in the polar regions it is about 33'5.
      The North Atlantic Ocean contains much more salt than the South
   Atlantic, which the author explains by the prevailing in<U+FB02>uence of the
   Gulf-stream ; and from his analyses of many samples of water taken
   in the current which <U+FB02>ows from N.E. to S.W., between Iceland and
   the east coast of Greenland, he thinks it highly probable that this
   East Greenland current is in reality not a polar current, but a return
   ing branch of the Gulf-stream, its mean quantity of salt being nearly
   the same as in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, viz. 35'5
V per 1000.
      The author then compared the Mediterranean with the Baltic, and
   stated that there is a double current at the entrance of the Baltic as
   well as in the Straits of Gibraltar; but with this difference, that the
   under-current of the Mediterranean runs out of, and the surface
 - current generally runs into, that sea; whereas the under-current of
   the Baltic is an entering one, and the surface-current of the Sound
   generally runs out into the Kattegat and North Sea. He showed,
   moreover, that the deep water in both seas is richer in salt than that
   from the surface, and consequently has a greater speci<U+FB01>c gravity.
       In the Atlantic he found the reverse, viz. that the quantity of
   saline ingredients in the water decreases with the depth, if the sam
   ples are taken at some distance from the shore; and as his analyses
    are sufficiently numerous, and include specimens from great depths
    (12,000 feet), he considers this unexpected result to be tolerably well
    established. He thinks that this fact would prove the existence of
    a polar current in the depths of the Atlantic, as well as in some parts
    of its surface.
       In the sea to the east of Africa he found the quantity of saline
   matter slightly increasing with the depth.

ON THE FORMS         OF LENSES PROPER FOR THE          NEGATIVE EYE
   PIECES OF TELESCOPES.         BY G. B. AIRY, ESQ., ASTRONOMER.
   ROYAL.                                                     '
   N the ‘_ Monthly Notices ’ for J mic and November last, there are
    discussions on the forms of lenses proper for the negative eyepiece.
Perhaps I shall not do wrong in stating to the Society that as long
ago as the year 1827 I made a most elaborate investigation of the
properties of eyepieces as depending on the curvatures of their sur
faces. The paper is entitled " On the Spherical Aberration of the
Eyepieces of Telescopes," and is printed in the ‘ Transactions of the
Cambridge Philosophical Society,’ vol. iii. This paper had been
preceded by one “ On the Chromatic Aberration of the Eyepieces of
Telescopes,” from which 1 had been able to infer the proportions of
the focal lengths and intervals of the lenses which (independently of
their curvatures) destroy colour at the sides of the <U+FB01>eld, using but
one kind of glass; and had selected some of these as examples to
which the formulae for spherical aberration were to be applied. One
of these is the Huyghenian eyepiece, with the following very com
mon prop0rtions:—-focal length of <U+FB01>rst lens or <U+FB01>eld-glass =3M ;
focal length of second lens or eye-glass =l\/I ; interval between the
two lenses =2M.
   The principal results as applying to the cases before us are the
following :—
   First, as regards distortion.
   I must refer to page 15 of the Memoir for the general formula;
but I may quote the following special results :—
   (a) It is possible to destroy distortion entirely, but not by the use
of common forms (equiconvex or plano-convex).
   (6) The most favourable combination of common lenses is,—the
<U+FB01>rst, equiconvex; the second, plano-convex, with its convex side
towards the <U+FB01>rst lens, or with its plane side next the eye.
   Second, as regards indistinctness at the edge of the <U+FB01>eld.
   From the general formulae in page 35, it appears that it is impos
sible in any.eyepiece whatever, in which the lenses are all convex,
to secure distinctness in the approach to the edge of the <U+FB01>eld,
except in some cases by movement of the eyepiece ; and the problem
always is to diminish the indistinctness as much as possible. For
this purpose, in the Huyghenian eyepiece,
   (0) The different points of the image may be made distinct by a
little sliding of the eyepiece, by a form very nearly the same as the
following :-
   (d) The best form is, for the <U+FB01>eld-glass, a meniscus, with convex
side towards the object-glass, and radii as 4 : ll ; and for the eye
glass a convex lens, the mere convex side towards the <U+FB01>eld-glass, and
radii as l : 6.  The constants by which the indistinctness in the two
dimensions is expressed are 2  126 and l26

    156               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
       (0) The best combination of common lenses is two plano-convex
    lenses, the plane sides of both towards the eye.      The constants of
        . .

              t ness th en are -        126
       (f) For a single lens to produce the same power, the smallest
   values of constants of indistinctness would be %  126 and 126
       The following rule, though not strictly accurate, will be found
    su<U+FB01>iciently accurate to give a very good practical determination of
    the curvatures of all eyepiece lenses in all cases.   Trace the course
    of an excentric pencil through the eyepiece. Consider separately the
    convergence, &c. of the axis of the pencil with regard to the axis of
   the telescope, and that of the rays of the pencil with regard to the
   axis of the pencil. When both these convergences fall on one side
   (as in the Huyghenian <U+FB01>eld-glass), the lens ought to be meniscus.
   When they are at equal distances on opposite sides, the lens ought
   to be equiconvex. When the convergence of either is much nearer
   (the other being on the opposite side), the side of the lens next it
   ought to be p1ane.—Monthly Notices qf the Roy. Astronom. Soc.

   ON THE DURATION OF THE COMBUSTION OF FUSES UNDER DIF
            FERENT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURES.           BY M. DUFOUR.
      Hitherto we have had but few data in reference to the in<U+FB02>uence
  of the atmospheric pressure on the activity of combustion. More
  over, what data we have sometimes appear contradictory; thus in
   1841 M. Triger noticed a more rapid combustion of candles in a
  medium where the air was under a pressure of three atmospheres;
   while Prof. Frankland in a recent ascent of Mont Blanc did not per
   ccive any essential difference between the combustion of candles at
  Chamounix and on the top of the mountain.
      In 1855 Quarter-Master Mitchell of the English Navy contributed
  to the Royal Society experiments made at different heights in the
  Himalayas with fuses. His results show that the duration of the
  combustion increases as the pressure decreases; the combustion
  appeared less active under a less pressure. Prof. Frankland repeated
  and con<U+FB01>rmed Mr. Mitchell's experiments. He used fuses of six
  inches from the Woolwich Arsenal; these fuses were burned in a.
  close vessel in an atmosphere which could be arti<U+FB01>cially exhausted.
  In Frankland's experiments the pressure necessarily varied a little
  between the commencement and the end of the combustion; and,
. spite of the ingenious arrangements which he adopted, it was to be
  feared that the combustion was in<U+FB02>uenced by the restricted dimen
  sions of the space in which it took place. In the month of last July
  I investigated the duration of the combustion of fuses under con
  ditions different _to those under which the English physicist worked.
  I operated in the open air, seeking at different heights on the Alps
  gradually lower pressures.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               157'
   The determination of the duration of the combustion of a fuse is
rather uncertain if the observer himself wishes to note on any chro
nometric apparatus the moment at which the fuse kindles, and that
at which it <U+FB01>nishes. There is great risk of the introduction of per
sonal errors, which are different in different cases. In order to avoid
these errors, I measured the duration of the combustion by means
of an electric register.      The fuse was lit by a pistol, in which the
fall of the lock broke the current. The end of the combustion ex
ploded a small quantity of powder, which, by letting a metallic rod
fall, again completed the circuit. The duration of the phenomenon
was thus indicated on the register by the interval between two con
tinuous marks; this interval is easily transformed into time by a
known process, which it is needless to develope here. Preliminary
 experiments were made in order to ascertain the degree of exaetitude
 of which the method and the apparatus were susceptible. These
 experiments show that the possible error did not exceed 1-15th of a
 second.
    Two groups of fuses were submitted to experiment under <U+FB01>ve
 different pressures, varying between 730 millimetres and 538 milli
 metres. The fuses were not so identical as to burn for exactly
 the same time under the same pressure. To know the in<U+FB02>uence of
 the density of the external air, it was necessary to burn a certain
 number of fuses in the same place, and then to take the mean: a
 comparison of the means ought to show the in<U+FB02>uence of the pressure.
 In order to neutralize as much as possible the inconvenience arising
 from the difference in the fuses, the means of eight to ten experi
 ments were taken at each station. Altogether 68 fuses were
 burned in the five stations. The crest of the Chenallettes, which
 commands the Convent of St. Bernard at 9700 feet above the sea
 level, is the highest station of the series. With some di<U+FB01>iculty the
 instruments were moved to and <U+FB01>xed at this elevated position.
    The fuses of the <U+FB01>rst group unfortunately presented considerable
 individual differences. Those of the second group were much more
 regular. The following is an abstract of the means :—

   Thus in both groups the duration increases as the pressure
diminishes.
   'I‘o determine the magnitude of this variation between two deter
minate pressures, it is enough to divide the increase of the duration
by the total duration at the higher pressure, and by the difference
of the pressures. A coefficient is thus obtained which expresses the
mean increase of the unit of duration (15) for a diminution of 1 milli
metre in the pressure. The differences in the fuses of the <U+FB01>rst
group were too great to be safely used in calculating this coe<U+FB01>icient;
those of the second group give the following values :—
       Between Ouchy and St. Pierre . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0‘00104
       Between St. Pierre and Chenallettes . . . . . . . . . . 0'0Ol08
   These two coe<U+FB02>icients, which are almost identical, show that the
increase in the duration of the combustion is proportional to the
diminution in pressure. This very simple law has been already
enunciated by Prof. Frankland.
   To compare the values I have obtained with _those of Messrs.
Mitchell and Frankland, it is enough to calculate by the aid of
their results the millirnetric coe<U+FB01>icient between limits of pressure

servations in the Himalayas at pressures of 7 52 and 584 millims., the
coe<U+FB01>icient is 000161 ; between the pressures 752 and 609 millims.
it is 000140. Thus the increase was a little greater in these fuses.
Of the six pressures in Prof. Frankland’s experiments, the two
which approach most closely to the limits within which I worked
are the_second, 7l6'8 millims., and the fourth, 5'/'0'2 millims.            He
found for the duration of the combustion:

   This is certainly a remarkable agreement, and the more interesting
as Prof. Frankland’s fuses differ both in dimensions, shape, and
duration from those which gave the above results. Hence it may be
admitted that the duration of the combustion of one of these fuses
increases on the average by 0'O011 of its value for each diminution
of a millimetre on the pressure.
   These facts have an importance which cannot be neglected in a
military point of view, and they ought to be taken into account
whenever the duration of the combustion of a fuse is an essential
element in its use.
    As to the cause of this increase of the duration of combustion
when the density of the surrounding air is less, one would at <U+FB01>rst
 sight be tempted to ascribe it to a diminution of the oxygen. This
 idea, however, is not tenable,'as the fuses contain enough burning
 substances in the form of nitrate. To convince myself directly that
 atmospheric oxygen does not intervene, I burned three fuses in a large

means of an electric current. The mean duration of the combustion
under a pressure of 715 millims. was 8"57. Hence it is the purely
physical part of the change in pressure which so strongly in<U+FB02>uences
the activity of the combustion of the fuses.--Comptes Rendus,

      In your Number for April 1858, Mr. Jennings mentions two lakes
  near Damascus as being without an outlet and yet fresh, which he
  regards a unique exception to the rule that lakes without an outlet
  are salt.   I think the lake of Tacarigua, or Valencia, in the north of
  South America is another instance of the same kind.            Humboldt,
  in his ‘ Personal Narrative,’ vol. iv., gives a description of the lake,
 which he distinctly states to be without outlet; and though I cannot
 <U+FB01>nd any statement in so many words as to whether it is salt or fresh,
  I infer the latter from the following circumstances :
     Were it salt, an observer like Humboldt would mention its degree
 of saltness.
     He compares it with the alpine lakes without mentioning saltness
 as a point of contrast.
     Its vegetation is that of fresh water. “ The banks, shaded by tufts
 of Coccoloba barbadensis, and decorated with <U+FB01>ne liliaceous plants
 (Pancratium undulatum, Amaryllis nervosa), remind us, by the appear
 ance of the aquatic vegetation, of the marshy shores of our lakes in
 Europe.     We <U+FB01>nd there pondweed (Potamogeton), Chara, and cat's
 tails 3 feet high."
     Its <U+FB01>shes are those of fresh water. It contains three kinds, “ the
 guavina, the vagra, and the sardina; the two last descend into the
 lake by the streams that <U+FB02>ow into it.”
     Humboldt also remarks, “It is somewhat remarkable that the
 lake of Valencia, and the whole system of small streams which <U+FB02>ow
 into it, have no large alligators, though this dangerous animal abounds
,a few leagues off in the streams that <U+FB02>ow either into the Apure or
 the Oroonoko, or immediately into the Caribbean Sea.”

XXI. On a New Determination of the Mercury Unit of Electrical
   Resistance in Dr. Siemens’s Laboratory. By Ronaar SABINE,
   Esq.*
THE result arrived at by the Committee appointed by the
        British Association to report on standards of electrical
resistance has induced Dr. Siemens to take up the subject
again, and he has in consequence had the mercury unit deter
mined for a third time.
   Following the original determination described by Dr. Siemens
in his paper “Vorschlag eines reproducirbaren Widerstands
maasses”-I‘, the comparison of six tubes, of very different resist
ances, with one Jacobi’s unit gave rise in some instances to an
employment of the measuring apparatus beyond the limits of its
exactness. This occasioned the observed resistances of the tubes
numbered 1, 4, 5, and 6 to appear greater or less than their
calculated values, according as a was less or greater than bi ;
where this was not the case, the differences were inconsiderable.
   At the time of the <U+FB01>rst reproduction §, only three of the six

  I a and b were the readings of the bridge wire.     This will completely
answer the criticism of Dr. A. Matthiessen (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxiv. p. 312),
who repeats Dr. Siemens’s <U+FB01>gures of the differences in question as a proof
that the method of a reproducible standard by means of mercury is not
more to be depended upon than that of his gold-silver alloy, but which
indeed only prove that the observed resistances are not so exact as the cal
culated,—in other words, that the measure produced was more exact than
the instruments by which it was employed.

Arm. vol. cxiii. p. 94).

162       - Mr. R. Sabine 071 a New Determination of
tubes used in the original determination remained unbroken.
These, with two new ones (numbered '7 and 8), were exactly
measured, and the weights of their contents of mercury, reduced
to 0° C., found to agree with the former reduced weights to within
0'05 per cent. The resistances of the tubes were compared this
time with spirals of glass tube, also <U+FB01>lled with mercury. Their
agreement was also within the limits which may be ascribed to
errors of observation and of the measuring-apparatus.
   The unit of this reproduction has found employment by many
physicists, and very extensively in telegraph measurements, both
in England and on the continent.
   For the present and second reproduction, ten tubes were
 used—four of those of the previous determinations remaining
unbroken, and six new ones.
   The new tubes were selected after a rough calibrating, and
ground off in lengths of a metre or less. They were then cleaned
 with concentrated sulphuric acid, rinsed with distilled water,
 dried by pumping dry air through them, and <U+FB01>nally wiped by
 drawing through them a little lump of cotton wool attached to
 the end of a couple of spirally-twisted silk-covered wires.
    The tubes were <U+FB01>nally calibrated as follows : a drop of mercury
was sucked into one end, its length not exceeding 40 millims.
The tube was then layed upon a metre scale and the lengths (L)
of the mercury thread measured, with aid of a small <U+FB01>nely-divided
scale and telescope, from one end to the other, at intervals of 20
 millims.
   The readings are collected in the following Table :—

      Readings with other lengths* were made in the same way at
  the places of greatest and least section, as shown by the preceding
  Table, and the coefficients (C) for correction for conicalness cal
  culated from means of the values of a given by the different
 readings.
      The formula employed is the same as developed by Dr. Siemens,
  and used in calculating the correction-coe<U+FB02>icients in the <U+FB01>rst
     * In the original determination the values of C were calculated a little
  too small, the result of employing atoo long thread of mercury (Pogg. Ann.
  vol. ex. p. 8. Table 1.), which has obviously the effect of hiding the smaller
  inequalities.    The differences are, however, not considerable, as will be
  seen by comparing the numbers.

   The capacities of the tubes were ascertained by <U+FB01>lling them
 with mercury, which was afterwards weighed.
    In the operation of <U+FB01>lling, care was taken to exclude air
 bubbles.
   An iron frame (A) was attached to one end of the tube D, as

on a table and <U+FB01>lled very slowly. If
no bubbles could be seen in the tubes,
the plate E was pressed tightly by
turning the screw B against the end.
    The rectangular bent glass was then
removed, and, leaving a small globe of
mercury protruding from the opening
of the tube, the whole was hung up
 with a delicate thermometer for an                  ‘
hour in the open air, protected by “V .

    In the following Table, column 2 gives the temperatures;
 column 3 the weights (in air of mean temperature) in grammes,
 after deducting the weight of the crucible; column 4 the same
 reduced for expansion of glass and mercury and for vacuum to
 0° C., column 6 the lengths, and column 7 the average inner
 radius.
    The formula by means of which the weights were reduced is

   But, in practice, the resistances with which the tubes enter into
the measuring-apparatus are greater than their calculated values
 by so much as is due to the passage of the current from their
openings into the cups of mercury for the connecting wires.
    This resistance can, without sensible error, be considered as
 the resistance of a hemispherical shell whose inner radius is
 equal to r, the inner radius of the tube, and whose outer radius
 is in<U+FB01>nitely great in comparison with r. The resistance dy of a
 shell of the thickness (in and radius .z' is expressed by

 It therefore amounts to increasing the length of each of the tubes
 by the length of its radius-I".
    * An idea of the exactness of this method of reproduction will be best
 obtained by a direct comparison of the calculated values according to the
 two previous and present determinations.

    It now remained to compare the tubes as resistances with each
other, in order to <U+FB01>nd in how far the calculated values would
then agree.

    In these measurements care was taken to <U+FB01>ll the two tubes
which were to be compared from the same bottle of mercury, and
to keep them during the measurement at the sametemperature.
For this purpose a zinc trough was provided, 2 yards long and
21} inches broad and deep, held in a wooden box, with sawdust
tightly packed between the zinc and the wood. On the bottom of
the trough, from one end to about three-fourths of its length, were
cemented a series of half a dozen glass tubes, and a water-tight
partition was put just over their ends so as to divide the trough
into two unequal parts, whose only connexion with each other
was through the <U+FB02>ooring of glass tubes. The trough was kept
three-fourths full of water, which could be made to circulate by
spooning it from one division into the other, and letting it run
back again through the glass tubes at the bottom.                     .
    The resistance tubes were furnished at their ends with rect
angular bent pieces of wide glass pipe, such as was used in <U+FB01>lling
them with mercury to ascertain their capacity, held fast by india
rubber stoppers. They were <U+FB01>lled very slowly with mercury, and
laid into the water-trough as closely as possible, side by side.
 The contacts between the tubes and with the measuring appa
 ratus were made by copper wires. The whole was protected by
 screens of vulcanite against rays of heat from the lamps and
 stoves of the laboratory. The temperature of the water in the
 trough varied during a single measurement not more than 1° C.,
 and during the whole series between 12° C. and 16° C., but did
 not fall below, nor rise beyond these limits. During each mea
 surement, the water was kept circulating in the way described,
 and equality of temperature of the platinum wire was secured by
 uninterruptedly fanning it.
     By these arrangements were gained some important advan
 tages: for example, all reductions for temperature and their
 concomitant errors were dispensed with, the thermo-currents
  (the unavoidable result of the employment of ice) in the systems
 were avoided, and the mercury was not required to be more than
 ordinarily pure.
     When the currents of the system were balanced (that is to say,
 when no effect was perceptible on the galvanometer by closing
 the battery circuit), if the contact-rollers were moved 0'1 millim.
 out of their place, the galvanometer mirror showed a de<U+FB02>ection
 represented by 5 millims. of the re<U+FB02>ected scale passing by the
 <U+FB01>bre of the telescope.
     The copper wire used in making the connexions between the '
 different parts was above 8 millims. diameter. It was softened
 and the ends amalgamated. The same length was inserted in
 the circuit of each tube (shown in the <U+FB01>gure by dotted lines).
  of the nonius was placed on the 500 line, when, with :r=W,, no de<U+FB02>ection
  was observed by inverting these resistances.     The wire had been drawn
  with great care through stone, and its conicalness was entirely inappreciable,

              The proportion of the balanced system was therefore

          the tube with which 2- is compared, and w the resistance of the
          connecting wires on each side = 0-37 millim. The effect of
          variations of temperature on the connexions may, without sen
          sible error, be disregarded.
              A mercury commutator (U) between the tubes and the mea
          suring-wire facilitated the inversion of the former for reading off
          the values of a and b from the same end.
              The tubes were re<U+FB01>lled between each measurement.

172          Mr. R. Sabine on a New Determination of
   The resistances (We) were produced by means of combinations.
   For tube 3, resistances of 10, 12, and 13 parallel; for tube
5, resistances of 3, 10, 12, and 13 parallel; and for tube 11,
resistances of 10, 14, and 15 one after the other.
   Such resistances as I have described are, however, incommo
dious on account of their length and the di<U+FB01>iculty of keeping
them, without special apparatus, at a constant temperature
during the measurements. Dr. Siemens’s method of copying
them in the form of glass spirals, however, removes all di<U+FB01>iculty
on this head, particularly as it is evident they may be copied
with great exactness. The only modi<U+FB01>cation which it was thought
advisable to introduce, was in double-winding the spirals to pre
vent induction currents, and in making the cups or pieces of
wide glass tube at their ends separate, to be cemented on or <U+FB01>xed
with thick india-rubber rings, instead of being fused on as was
done previously. The spirals are easier made, and are not so
easily broken. Copies of the normals have been made approxi
mating to 0'1, 0'2, 0'5, 1'0, and so on, up to 10 metres’ resistance,
by direct comparison with combinations of the normal tubes ; and
beyond 10 and up to 50 metres, two or three spirals of nearly
equal resistances were <U+FB01>rst compared with each other, and then
their combined (parallel) resistance with a combination of normals
of about the same value.
   By grinding off the ends, they can, of course, be made exact
multiples of the unit.
   The subsequent process of copying these spirals in metal wire
for resistance-scales is obvious.
   Following this method, every electrician may inexpensively
and with little trouble make himself a standard measure. It is
of course needless to determine the capacities of ten tubes, as was
done in this reproduction, the only purpose in view in the mul
tiplicity being to ascertain the maximum disagreement between
the tubes when compared as resistance-measures. This maximum
has been shown to be within the amount of errors of observation
in the comparison. The mercury unit has therefore been pro
duced in Dr. Siemens’s laboratory twenty-one times—six times
in the <U+FB01>rst determination, <U+FB01>ve times in the second, and ten times
in the present. And, allowing for the unfortunate misrepresen
tation of the measure by individual errors of the measuring
apparatus used in the comparison of the <U+FB01>rst tubes, the agree
ment between them all is greater than could be guaranteed
between any two single electrical measurements with different
measuring-apparatus.
   From the foregoing results it follows that, by the method of
direct production proposed by Dr. Siemens, much greater exact
ness has been attained than by means of any of the other methods
of determination or copying.

              the Mercury Unit of Electrical Resistance.                 173
' The copies of an arbitrarily chosen unit of resistance, subject
to the errors incidental to copying, must be less exact than
the resistances directly calculated according to the de<U+FB01>nition of
Dr. Siemens. In addition to this, we have no certainty that
coils of wire do not change their resistance in course of time.
  ' I believe it is generally the disposition of English physicists
to accept as common unit of resistance the absolute unit of the
beautiful system of Weber. The advantages of this unit are,
however, limited to facilitating the solution of some purely scien
ti<U+FB01>c problems, and may be completely reached, without materially
increasing the di<U+FB01>iculties, by a single careful determination of
the mercury unit in absolute measure; and its general adop
tion by electricians would only be serviceable in so far as it would
be the means of introducing a common measure. But, to its
 disadvantage, the reproduction of the absolute unit is attended
with expense and time which few physicists would be in a position
 to sacri<U+FB01>ce to it. Then, again, its determination depends upon
 the measurements of several forces, of which each is burthened
 with comparatively great sources of error.             Attending each sub
 ordinate measurement, in fact, the possible error is greater than
 that of the simple comparison of two nearly equal resistances.
 It is evident, therefore, that the determination of resistance in
 absolute units is not adapted for the production of normal coils.
 The di<U+FB01>'erences between the values of the mercury unit, according
 to the determinations of absolute measureby Weber and Thomson,
 entirely con<U+FB01>rm this opinion; for we can look for the causes of
 di<U+FB01>erences between the results of two of the most world-renowned
 physicists only in the system, not for a moment in the manipu
 lation.
     Supposing, however, the absolute unit to be reproducible with
 certainty within 0'1 per cent., and supposing that the electrician
 overcame the inconvenience of the mass of <U+FB01>gures required
               millimetre
 to expressa               unit by employing as unit of resistance
                  second
 the same multiplied with 101° (which would bring it to about the
 value of one mercury unit)*, recourse must still be had to the
 arbitrary system as a ready means of reproduction. A second
 de<U+FB01>nition of the 10'0 absolute unit, as “the resistance of a prism
 of mercury a metre long and 10257 square millimetre section at
 0° C.,” would inevitably sooner or later creep into general use.
     The necessity of accepting mercury as unit of conducting

 necessary' for example 1016 m-——11llmetre

 absolute units.                                                              '

 174          Sir David Brewster on the Pressure Cavities
 power, since its molecular condition in common temperatures
 renders it alone capable to take that position, is an argument in
 favour of its adoption also as unit of resistance. It is, indeed,
 in practice almost a necessity to de<U+FB01>ne the common resistance
 unit as the resistance of a body of the same material as is chosen
 for unit of conductibility, by which means calculations with it
 are facilitated, and a perfect notion of the measure secured.
    An absolute unit might be adopted as measure of electro
 motive force even were a de<U+FB01>ned body of mercury to hold the
 place of resistance unit: it must, however, be confessed that the
 system of measurement would lose in consistency and con
 formity to the purpose; besides which the determination of
 electromotive force in absolute measure is burthened with
 material sources of error, and is therefore opposed by the same
 objections which are tenable against the absolute resistance unit.
    Dr. Siemens has lately given his attention to the construction
of a reproducible unit of electromotive force, capable of being
exactly defined, and commodious, and will shortly publish the
results of his endeavours.
 XXII. On the Pressure Cavities in Topaz, Beryl, and Diamond,
    and their hearing on Geological Theories. By Sir DAVID
    Baawsraa, K.H., F.R.S.*
 IN the years 1823 and 1826 I communicated to this:Society two
        papers “ On the Existence of Two New Fluids in the Cavi
ties of Precious Stones and other Minerals.” These two <U+FB02>uidsf
Were generally found together in the same cavity, though some~
times the cavities were occupied by only one of them. They
were perfectly transparent and immiscible. The denser of the
two occupied the angles of the cavities, or the necks, or narrow
passages, or canals which united two or more larger cavities;
while the rarer <U+FB02>uid <U+FB02>oated, as it were, on the other in deep
cavities, or <U+FB01>lled the body of shallower ones, with the exception
of a circular vacuity, which diminished and disappeared with the
slightest increase of temperature, or enlarged itself and dis
appeared in consequence of the <U+FB02>uid being converted into vapour.
    The denser of these <U+FB02>uids does not appear to expand more
than oil or water by the application of heat; but the other is
twenty-one times more expansible than water. It evaporates at
temperatures from 74° to 84°. The vacuity in it disappears by
the heat of the mouth or of the hand ,- and it returns to its former
state by a violent elfervescence, producing a number of minute

vacuities, which <U+FB01>nally unite in one. The refractive power of
the expansible <U+FB02>uid varies from 1'1311 to 12106, while that of
the denser <U+FB02>uid is 1'2946, which is very much less than that of
water. From the few experiments which I was able to make on
these <U+FB02>uids when taken out of the cavities, it has been inferred
that they are hydrocarbons.
   The distribution of these cavities, in the specimens which
contain them, is a subject of peculiar interest. They are often
found singly, and of different sizes, at di<U+FB02>erent depths in the
mineral ; but they most frequently occur in strata, and of such
dilferent magnitudes that the two <U+FB02>uids are distinctly seen in
the largest, while the rest gradually diminish till they disappear
in black points which the microscope can hardly descry. Three
or four strata nearly parallel to one another, and with cavities of
di<U+FB02>'e1-ent sizes, rarely occur.      In general the strata lie in planes
frequently intersecting one another, and having no connexion
with the primitive or secondary planes of the crystal. In some
specimens the planes of the strata are curved, and in rare cases
the sections of these planes are curves of contrary <U+FB02>exure.
    In 1844 I was led to re-examine several hundred specimens
of topaz with a more perfect microscope and a fine polarizing
apparatus, with the view of ascertaining the nature and proper
ties of certain crystalline deposits which I had noticed, and to
which I had referred in my earliest observations*. In these
 new researches, the results of which were published in two papers
 in the ‘ Transactions’ of this Society for 1845, I discovered two
 new classes of phenomena which had escaped the notice of pre
 ceding observers, and which threw much light on the formation
 of the minerals in which they were exhibited.
    In many specimens of topazfrom Brazil and New Holland, I
 discovered numerous cavities, <U+FB01>lled with crytals of various
 primitive forms, and with different physical properties.           These
 crystals are either <U+FB01>xed or moveable. Some of the <U+FB01>xed crystals
 are beautifully crystallized, and have their axes of double refrac
 tion coincident with those of the specimen which contains them.
 In some cavities there is only one crystal, in many two, three,
 and four, and in a great number the crystals actually <U+FB01>ll the
 cavities to such a degree that the circular vacuity in the <U+FB02>uid
 cannot take its natural shape, and can often be scarcely recog
 nized among the jostling crystals.
    Upon the application of heat to these crystals, some of them
 gradually lost their angles, and melted slowly, till not a trace of
 them was visible. Others melted with greater dif<U+FB01>culty; and
 some resisted the most powerful heat I could apply. The
    * See Edinburgh Transactions, vol. x. p. 21, note, and plate 1. <U+FB01>g. 10,
 plate 2. <U+FB01>gs. 20, 21 ; p. 419, note, and plate 19. <U+FB01>g. 4.

176         Sir David Brewster on the Pressure Cavities
crystals which melted easily were quickly reproduced, some
times reappearing in a more perfect form, but frequently run
ning into amorphous shapes or granular crystallizations. While
some of the crystals were resuming a tabular form, their tints,
under the polarizing microscope, gradually rose in the scale of
colours as their thickness increased ; and when there happened
to be numerous crystals in the specimen, the whole <U+FB01>eld of
the microscope was <U+FB01>lled with brilliant portions of light which
they polarized.
   While making these observations, crystals of a different kind
presented themselves to me when the specimens which contained
them were exposed to polarized light. These crystals were
imbedded in the topaz ; and as their axes of double refraction
were not coincident with those of the mineral, they were seen
in the obscure <U+FB01>eld of the microscope, brilliant with all the
colours of polarized light. They often polarize <U+FB01>ve or six orders
of colours; and in general they have beautiful crystalline forms,
which are visible in the microscope even in common light. In
some specimens of Brazil topaz, the imbedded crystals occur in
groups of singular beauty, consisting of prisms and hexagonal
plates, connected apparently by <U+FB01>laments of opake matter. In all
these specimens the crystals had a distinct outline, whether they
were examined in common or in polarized light; but I have
met with topazes in which the imbedded crystals had no visible
outline in common light, and which never could have been
detected but by the polarizing microscope. In one of these an
amorphous crystal, nearly spherical, lay in a crowded group of
small <U+FB02>uid-cavities, none of which had entered it—a proof that
the cavities had been formed in the topaz when soft, and when
it imprisoned the previously indurated crystal.
   The other class of phenomena to which I have referred is of a
still more remarkable nature, and has a more direct bearing on
geological theories. About thirty years ago I communicated to
the Geological Society the singular fact that I had found in a
diamond a small cavity, round which four luminous sectors were
seen in polarized light—a phenomenon which clearly proved
that the diamond, when in a soft state, had been compressed by
an elastic force proceeding from the cavity. This inference
countenances the opinion that the diamond was of vegetable
origin; and as this gem was a sort of outlaw in the mineral
world, the idea that it had once been in a plastic state, like
amber and other gums, and susceptible of compression, did not
startle the mineralogists who believed in the ordinary doctrine
of crystallization. The insulated fact, therefore, and the pro
bable inference from it, excited no notice; and it was not till the
same phenomenon had been observed more frequently in the

                     . in Topaz, Beryl, and Diamond.                      177'
  diamond, and in other minerals supposed to be of aqueous forma
 tion, that its geological importance was likely to be acknowledged.
     In the Koh-i-noor diamond, which the Prince Consort kindly
 permitted me to examine in 1852, I found three black specks,
 scarcely visible to the eye, but which the microscope showed to
 be irregular cavities, surrounded with sectors of polarized light.
 In the two smaller diamonds which accompanied the Koh-i-noor,
 there were also several cavities surrounded with luminous sectors,
 and the same polarizing structnre,which indicated the operation of
 compressing and dilating forces*. In order to obtain more
 information on this subject, I examined nearly <U+FB01>fty diamonds
 lent me by Messrs Hunt and Roskill, and in almost all of them
 I found numbers of cavities, of the most singular forms, round
 which the substance of the stone had been compressed and
 altered in a remarkable manner. The shapes of the cavities
 sometimes resembled those of insects and lobsters, and the
 streaks and patches of colour in polarized light were of the most
 variegated kind. In examining a large number of diamonds
 which adorn some of the oriental objects in the East India
 Company’s Museum, I found that all these stones contained
 large cavities, and were coarse or <U+FB02>awed diamonds, which could
 not be cut into brilliants or used in rings or other ornaments.
 It seems, indeed, to be a general truth that there are compara
 tively few diamonds without cavities and <U+FB02>aws, and that this
 mineral is a fouler stone than any other used in jewellery.
Some diamonds, indeed, derive their black colour entirely from
 the number of cavities which they contain, and which will not
permit any light to pass between them.
     Having found in diamond so many Pressure Cavities, as we
 may call them, round which the substance of the stone is com
pressed, I had some expectation of <U+FB01>nding them in other mine
rals ; and upon re-examining the numerous plates of topaz in
 my possession, I succeeded in discovering several under such
remarkable circumstances that I submitted a description and
 drawings of them to this Society in 18451: In searching for
this phenomenon with the polarizing microscope, we <U+FB01>rst observe
four sectors of depolarized light; and if the magnifying power is
sufficient, we shall <U+FB01>nd in the centre of the black cross that sepa
rates the sectors a small opake speck, which is the cavity or seat
of the compressing force. This cavity is frequently of a rhom
boidal form, and often only the 3000th or 4~O0Oth of an inch in
diameter. It is always opake, as if the elastic substance which

178         Sir David Brewster on the Pressure Cavities
it contained had collapsed into a black powder; andl have met
with only one cavity in which there was a speck of light in its
centre. The polarized tint in the luminous sectors varies from
the faintest blue to the white of the <U+FB01>rst order. In most cases
the elastic force has spent itself in the compression of the topaz,
the cavity remaining entire, and without any apparent <U+FB01>ssure by
which a gas or a <U+FB02>uid could escape. I have discovered, however,
other cavities, and these generally of a larger size, in which the
sides have been rent by the elastic force, and <U+FB01>ssures, from one
to six in number, propagated to a small distance around them.
These <U+FB01>ssures have modi<U+FB01>ed the doubly refracting structure
produced by compression, but the gas or <U+FB02>uid which has
escaped has left no solid matter on the faces of fracture.
   Soon after the publication of these results, I discovered still
more remarkable cavities in a specimen of beryl brought from
India by the Marchioness of Tweeddale, who was so kind as to
present it to me. In cutting the crystal, Mr. Sanderson found
that one end of it was foul, and produced a luminous ring round
a candle. This ring, similar to the rings seen in certain speci
mens of Iceland spar, was produced by long and irregularly
tubular cavities parallel to the sides of the hexagonal prism.
As the tubes had been cut across by the lapidary, their contents
had escaped; but whatever the contents were, whether <U+FB02>uid or
gaseous, they had compressed the beryl, and produced the four
luminous sectors around each cavity. This aggregation of lumi
nous sectors produced a mass of depolarized light, which com
pletely elfaced the black cross of the uniaxal system of rings
exhibited by the mineral. Di<U+FB02>erent degrees of compression
were produced by cavities of different sizes ; but the resulting
tint was generally a white of the <U+FB01>rst order, rising in some cases
to a yellow of the same order.
   Such is a brief notice of the <U+FB02>uid- and pressure cavities which
exist in minerals, and which have a very obvious bearing on
geological theories. Some of these facts have been upwards of
forty years before the public*, and, along with others more
recently discovered, have been widely circulated in British and
foreign journals; and yet none of our geologists have made the
slightest reference to them, either as di<U+FB02>iculties to be explained,
or arguments to be advanced in support of their own views.
   In 1822 Sir H. Davy, when he was acquainted only with the
existence in minerals of water, petroleum, and gas, did not hesi
tate to regard such facts as “seeming to afford a decisive argu
ment in favour of the igneous theory of crystalline rocks” 1';
and in my paper of 1826 I was driven to the conclusion “that
       * Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, vol. ii. p. 334, 1820.
      1' Philosophical Transactions, 1822, p. 367.

                   in Topaz, Beryl, and Diamond.                 179
the cavities containing the two new <U+FB02>uids were formed by highly
elastic substances, when the mineral itself has been either in a
state of fusion or rendered soft by heat.” At this time I was
acquainted only with the two new <U+FB02>uids, and some of their
chemical and physical properties; but when I had studied their
arrangement in strata, this opinion acquired additional weight.
Had these cavities been arranged in planes parallel to the primitive
or secondary faces of the crystal, some argument might be urged
in favour of their aqueous formation; but when it was found
that the strata of cavities traversed the crystal in all possible
directions, that they were bent also into curves of contrary
<U+FB02>exure, and that even individual cavities had acurvilinear shape,
it was impossible to resist the conclusion that the cavities were
formed, and thus capriciously distributed, when the substance
of the crystal was in a soft or plastic state. This conclusion
derives additional strength from the fact that the water-cavities
in crystals deposited from an aqueous solution are never thus
arranged.
    The discovery of pressure cavities in topaz and diamond may
be considered as completing the evidence for the igneous origin
of these minerals, and of the rocks which contain them. We know
that gas in a state of compression exists in minerals. In the
pressure cavities we have not only the seat of an elastic force,
but its direct action upon the substance of the crystal. Though
of equal density throughout, as is proved by the equality of its
polarized tints, the crystal has its density increased round the
pressure cavity, the density being a maximum close to the cavity.
 Such a structure is impossible in crystals formed by aqueous
deposition ; and hence there is not a single example of a pressure
cavity in any of them. They exist, however, in amber and in
glass, substances that have once been in a plastic state; and I
have produced them arti<U+FB01>cially by compressing a solution of
gum-arabic between two plates of glass so as to include some
bubbles of air. The air in these cavities, being exposed to
changes of temperature, compresses the circumjacent gum, and
gives it that variation of density which produces four luminous
 sectors in polarized light, exactly of the same character as those
which are found in topaz and diamond.                               .
    The existence of crystals of different physical properties in the
cavities of minerals, and of imbedded crystals either shooting
through their mass, or occurring in groups, or lying singly with
 their optical axes in every direction, admit of no other explana
 tion than that which is afforded by supposing the surrounding
 mineral to have been in a state of fusion, and to have either
 contained the elements of the imbedded crystals, or to have
 surrounded them when previously formed.

    Although, as I have already stated, no British geologist has
seen the importance of the preceding facts, and their direct
bearing on geological theories, yet they have been recently
referred to*, and their value fully appreciated, by French
geologists. In a discussion with M. Elie de. Beaumont on the
formation of mineral veins, M. Fournet'|', the distinguished
Professor of Geology at Lyons, has given a full and interesting
account of this class of phenomena, and has adduced them to
prove that mineral veins are formed by the injection of mineral
matters in the state of fusion. In opposition to this argument,
M. Elie do Beaumont makes the following observations :—“ It
is di<U+FB02>icult,” says he, “to admit that crystals of quartz contain
ing two oily <U+FB02>uids, one of which is volatile at the temperature of
81° Fahr., have crystallized in a bath of quartz in fusion. But
quartz forms part of the gangues of the greater number of veins,
and quartz with <U+FB02>uid-cavities is far from being a rarity”I.
 M. Fournet§ has, we think, removed this difficulty ; but, with
 out entering into the question as one of geology, we may safely
 assert that dif<U+FB01>culties attaching to any theory are not arguments
against it, especially if there are only two theories, and if equal
 di<U+FB01>iculties attach to them both. We are so utterly unacquainted
 with the conditions under which the primitive rocks were formed,
 with the temperatures which prevailed at their formation, and
 with the pressures to which they must have been subject, that
 we are not entitled to charge any theory with difficulties which
 have their origin in our own ignorance, or in the very nature of
.the subject. We may never understand how the cavities in
 topaz have such singular and complex forms as those which I
 have described and delineated;-how these cavities should contain
 in one specimen two immiscible <U+FB02>uids, the one dense and the
  other volatile, and in another specimen various crystals of dif
  ferent primitive forms and physical properties. We may never
  understand how 0. series of these cavities could have arranged
 themselves in lines now straight and parallel, now curved and
  concentric, and now radiating from a centre; or how strata of
  these cavities could traverse the topaz in all directions with sur
  faces of single or double curvature. We may not be able to
  explain the special dit<U+FB01>culty started by M. Elie dc Beaumont;
  and yet it is absolutely certain that an elastic force, emanating
  from a pressure cavity, could not have compressed the topaz
  which surrounded it, unless the mineral had been in a soft and
  plastic state, or in the state of fusion.

XXIII. Note on a Theorem relating to a Triangle, Line, and Conic.
                            By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
I FIND, among my papers headed “ Generalization of aTheo
       rem of Steiner's,” an investigation leading to the following
theorem, viz. :—
     Consider a triangle, a line, and a conic; with each vertex of
the triangle join the point of intersection of the line with the
polar of the same vertex in regard to the conic; in order that
the three joining lines may meet in a point, the line must be a
tangent to a curve of the third class; if, however, the conic
break up into a pair of lines, or in a certain other case, the curve
of the third class will break up into a point, and a conic inscribed
 in the triangle.
     Let the equations of the sides of the triangle be

        XXIV. Supplement to a Theory of the Zodiaeal Light.
           By Professor CHALLIS, M./1., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
 AT the end of my communication on the Zodiacal Light in
         the February Number, reference is made to another pheno
 menon of like character, respecting which I expressed the opinion
 that it is probably related to the zodiacal light, but I did not
 attempt to give a theoretical explanation of it. Subsequent con
 sideration of the observations to which I there referred has led me
 to the conclusion that it is so closely connected with the ordinarily
 observed zodiacal light, that the same theory ought to embrace
 both phenomena. The theory which I proposed should ac
 cordingly be capable of this extension; and it is my present
 object to show in what manner this demand upon it may be
 satis<U+FB01>ed. But <U+FB01>rst I must state the precise nature of the phe
 nomenon proposed to be explained, so far as that may be
 gathered from the accounts of Mr. Jones and Prof. Brorsen,
 which are the only ones that I am acquainted with.
    The description of the luminous appearance by Mr. Jones,
 whose observations of the zodiacal light I referred to in my
former communication, is contained in a letter to the editor of
the ‘Astronomical Journal’ (vol. v. p. 28), dated Quito, No
vember I8, 1856. After describing the advantages of his posi
tion in regard both to situation on the earth's surface relative to
the ecliptic, and the rarity and transparency of the atmosphere,
he makes a statement of the phenomena which had better be
given in his own words. “My observations,” he says, “ are
made on the summit of the hill Ychinbia, immediately adjoining
Quito on the cast, a place where I have horizons su<U+FB02>iciently open
and clear. It is not my present object to give details of obser
vations, but simply to notice one result, in hope of now drawing
attention to the subject, and perhaps of inducing other observers
to give it their particular notice. I see here every night, and all
through the night, a luminous arch from east to west, quite across
the sky. This arch, 20° wide, is visible at all hours, when the
sky is clear, but is brightest and most striking when the ecliptic
                     ‘ Communicated by the Author.

184       Prof. Challis an a Theory of the Zodiac-al Light.
is vertical, at which times it looks almost like another Milky
Way.     It is very evidently the zodiacal light.      This luminous
arch, I know, is not a new discovery ; for Baron Humboldt saw
it in the seas of Mexico, and Professor Brorsen has noticed it
more fully in Germany.       I also had glimpses of it in my late
 cruise in the eastern seas.    Here, however, it is developed with
 a remarkable degree of distinctness, and I am giving it particular
 attention.” At the time of his writing, his observations at
 Quito had been of eleven weeks’ continuance. He further states
 that the light of the luminous arch has little reference to change
 of position as regards the ecliptic, and that “ while the zodiacal
 light over the horizon tapers off in intensity as it ascends up
 wardly, the luminous arch, after this other ceases, is uniform
 quite across the sky.”
    In a <U+FB01>rst letter, contained in vol. xlii. of the Astronomische
 Nachrichten (col. 219), and dated from Senftenberg, 1855, Nov.
 13, Prof. Brorsen states that in that place, and also in the Isle of
 Alsen in the Duchy of Schleswig, he had observed during the
 two preceding years a luminosity, which he calls a re<U+FB02>exion
 (Gegenschein) of the zodiacal light ; and he then gives, as follows,
 the result in substance of the two years’ observations. “The
 re<U+FB02>exion is seen at the times of both equinoxes, but is more per
 ceptible in spring than in autumn.      The <U+FB01>rst faint trace may be
 remarked as early as February, after which, in March, April, and
 the beginning of May, it increases continually in brightness and
 extent. The much fainter and smaller autumn re<U+FB02>exion is ap
 parent during the months of September, October, and No
 vember. Respecting both, it is a fact of which I have convinced
 myself by repeated observations, that the brightest part lies
 exactly opposite the sun’s place, so that the estimated point of
 greatest intensity agrees within half a degree with the opposition
 point of the sun. Further, the observations indicated that the
 spring re<U+FB02>exion towards the middle of April connects itself, by
 a very faint beginning, becoming by degrees brighter, as a
 scarcely perceptible light streak, with the westerly zodiacal light ;
 while the autumn re<U+FB02>exion in the <U+FB01>rst half of November appears
  stretched along the ecliptic to the westerly horizon in a faint,
  scarcely recognizable girdle of light, which gradually, by in
  creasing brightness and more extended base, passes over into the
 known appearance of the winter-evening zodiacal light. But
 from this time to the beginning of March, its point remains
  quite stationary about the position of 'r, and 1-, Arietis. Both re
 <U+FB02>exions can be distinctly seen here at the same time of the year
  on each evening that the sky is clear and the region of the
  heavens in which they are situated is moderately high, even after
  the commencement of moonlight.”

          Prof. Challis on a Theory of the Zodiacal Light.     185
   In a subsequent communication, entitled “ On the Ring-form
Shape of the Zodiacal Light,” and dated October 18, 1858, Prof.
Brorsen gives observations made at Senftenberg from April 1854
to October l858, of the positions of maximum intensity of “the
faint extension of the ordinary zodiacal light from west and east
along the ecliptic,” which he had described in his former letter.
The observations are all made either in February, March, April,
and May, or in August, September, and October; and certainly the
estimated positions of the maximums agree remarkably with the
points of opposition to the sun. The second letter is contained
in the Astronomische Nachrichten, vol. xlix. col. 219.
   Allowance being made for the difference of positions of the
observers, it can hardly be doubted that these two accounts refer
to the same phenomenon. The chief point of discrepancy is that
the American observer does not notice a position of maximum
intensity, but states, on the contrary, that the luminous arch is
uniform quite across the sky, while on this fact the other ob
server speaks very decidedly. On the other hand, it may be re
marked that Prof. Brorsen’s description of the phenomenon in
the <U+FB01>rst half of November, as being an extremely faint girdle of
light extending along the ecliptic to the horizon, agrees well
enough with the result of the observations at Quito, the differ
ent estimations of the intensity of the light being readily ac
counted for by the difference of the localities.
    Such being the account of the principal features of the phe
 nomenon, I proceed now to offer a theoretical explanation of it,
 after recalling attention to the theory of the zodiacal light pro
 posed in my last communication. The latter luminosity is there
 ascribed to gyrations of the sethereal medium produced by the
 rotation of the sun about its axis, and to disturbances which
 they undergo by reason of the motion of translation of the
 sun in space. It was considered that the effect of this motion
 would be the same as if the tether were impressed with an
 equal motion in the opposite direction. The sun would thus be
 at rest, and together with the steady gyrations there would be a
 uniform stream of the tether. It was proved by mathematical
 reasoning that such steady motions might coexist without mutual
 disturbance, so far as terms including the square of the velocity
 indicate, and that disturbances would arise out of motions
 expressed by terms of the third and higher orders relative to the
 velocity. Such disturbances, it was supposed, might become
 sensible in the form of light-undulations originating in the space
 common to the two motions. It is, however, to he said that in
 this way the zodiacal light may be accounted for, but no expla
 nation is given of the related phenomenon of the luminous arch ;
 and, moreover, it must be admitted that no reason is given in

  I86       Prof. Challis on a Theory of the Zodiacal Light. i
  this theory for concluding that motions expounded by terms of
  the third order would be adequate to produce, excepting in very
  small degree, the former phenomenon. I think also that the.
  origins of both luminosities ought to be looked for in dis
  turbances of vibratory motions, rather than in those of steady
  motions.    If we supposed the luminosity to be due to a kind of
  re<U+FB01>exion of the solar rays from the parts of the aether subject to
  the gyratory motion, we should, it is true, have disturbances of
 vibratory motions expressed by terms of the order of the square
  of the velocity, and might thus account for the zodiacal light, but
 the phaenomenon which is the immediate subject of this inquiry
 would still be left unexplained.
     I come now to a consideration which, if I had proceeded con
 sistently with the general theory of the physical forces which I
 expounded some time since in this Magazine, would have been
 introduced at <U+FB01>rst. It is the characteristic of a true physical
 theory that it fails only when its consequences are not rigidly
 and completely followed out, whereas a false or imperfect theory
 breaks down under this very process. It may be remembered
 that in that general theory the different physical forces are
 accounted for by the dynamical action of different orders of un
 dulations of the aethereal medium, and that the force of gravity
 -was ascribed to undulations emanating from masses, and of
 much larger dimensions than those which produce the pheno
 mena of light. Now such large undulations emanating from
 the sun would be subject to disturbances expressed by terms of
 the second order in respect to velocity in their passage through
 those portions of the aether which are in gyratory motion ; and
 disturbances of this kind might, as I have elsewhere argued, he
 made up of vibratory motions of di<U+FB01>erent orders, a portion of
 which may be presumed to be of the light-producing order.
‘But if we take into account the gravity-undulations emanating
 from the sun, it is evident that we must also take account of
 those emanating from the earth. Also it should be borne in
 mind that Mr. .lones’s observations prove that the zodiacal light
 extends to a distance from the sun greater than the radius of
 the earth’s orbit. It is therefore an obvious inference from
 these considerations, to ascribe the zodiacal light to the gravity
undulations from the sun, and the luminous arch to those from
the earth.
    The reason that the terrestrial undulations produce a sensible
effect in regions where the effect of the solar undulations is too
faint to be perceptible is, that they are really much the more
powerful within a certain distance from the earth. The distance
from the earth, along the prolongation of the earth’s radius
_vector, at which the effects would be equal, may be calculated

         Prof. Challis on a Theory of the Zodiacal Light.      187
onthe following principle. By knowing the law of gravity and
the proportion of the attractions of the sun and earth at the
unit of distance from their centres, we can <U+FB01>nd the point on the
prolongation of the earth’s radius-vector at which the sun’s
attraction is just equal to that of the earth.   This point will be
found to be at the distance of 152,500 miles nearly from the
earth’s centre. Now, without borrowing from theory more than
that the gravitating effect of sethereal undulations, and their
luminous effect now under consideration, each depend on terms
of the order of the square of the velocity, we may, I think, pre~
sume that, since in each case there is no other difference of
circumstances than that one set of undulations proceeds from
the sun and the other from the earth, the effects of both kinds
are in the same proportion.     Accordingly, at distances from the
earth within that above stated, the luminous effect of the ter
restrial undulations will exceed that of the solar. It is there
fore reasonable to infer that the total effect of the coexistence
within that space of the terrestrial and solar undulations and
the solar gyrations is the appearance of the luminous arch. It
is evident that it may present the considerable breadth of 20°
from its having its origin at points comparatively near the earth,
and that it is at the same time limited in breadth on account of
the limited transverse extent of the gyrations.
   The above explanation seems to be open to the following
objection. It may be urged that the earth’s rotation about its
axis must also produce gyratory motions of the aether, and that
the coexistence of these with the terrestrial gravity-undulations
should, according to the same principles, produce a luminosity
 disposed about the plane of the earth’s equator, presenting the
appearance of a luminous belt in that direction. To this I
reply that, judging from the phenomenaof the zodiacal light
 where it approaches the body of the sun, the luminosity would
be spread over the whole of the earth’ surface, and, without
 presenting a de<U+FB01>nite outline, would only be somewhat in excess
as seen from the equatorial parts. In fact, in this way we may
 account, in great part, at least, for the luminousncss of the sky
which is observable every clear night at all places and all seasons
of the year. This phenomenon has not escaped the attention of
either theorists or observers. Mr. Jones has made the following
 interesting statement of what he noticed at Quito. “ The thin
ness of the air on this plateau, by which, during the day, objects
 a great way off are seen with remarkable distinctness, and seem
to be near by, might be expected to assist in atmospheric deve
lopments of several kinds, unusual at other places; and such is
also the fact. A phenomenon which has sometimes drawn the
 attention of philosophers, namely, a general brightness of the

188       .Prof. Challis on a Theory of the Zodiacal Light.
air at night, without any apparent cause for it, is in some nights
very remarkable here.      I <U+FB01>nd it has been noticed by others as
well as myself. The brightness, without moon or any assign
able reason, has been so great at times, that I have taken out
printed papers or books to ascertain whether I could not see to
read by it.”
    With respect to the variations of the visibility of the arch in
di<U+FB02>erent seasons of the year, noticed by Prof. Brorsen, two cir
cumstances have to be considered. First, as in the case of the
zodiacal light, the visibility of so faint a luminosity is dependent
on the inclination of the ecliptic to the horizon at the times of
observation. It seems that on this account the observations at
Senftenberg were chie<U+FB02>y made near the times of the vernal and
autumnal equinoxes. Again, the plane of symmetry of the
zodiacal light being inclined at a small angle to the plane of the
ecliptic, and the arch having its origin at the outlying portions
of the gyrations, the degree of its brightness will depend, much
more than that of the zodiacal light, on the earth's proximity to
the nodes. There being reasons for concluding, as I showed in
the former paper, that the earth passes the nodes about June
6 and December 6, it will be seen why, as stated by Prof.
Brorsen, the brightness increases on advancing from the equi
noxes towards those epochs, and why, regard being had to the
positions of the ecliptic, the times most favourable for its visi
bility are not quite synchronous with those for the visibility of
the zodiacal light.
    Another fact distinctly attested by Prof. Brorsen, namely, the
greater visibility of the arch in spring than in autumn, seems
to point to some degree of eccentricity of the zodiacal light rela
tive to the sun’s position. An eccentricity of this kind might
very reasonably be attributed to an e<U+FB02>'ect of the disturbance of
the aether caused by the motion of the body of the sun in space.
 Hitherto we have taken no account of this disturbance; but it
 is evident that the motion of translation produces, as well as the
 rotatory motion, a steady motion relative to the sun, and that
 the whole relative steady motion of the aather is really com
 pounded of the effects of the two movements. The resolved
 part of the sun’s motion perpendicular to the plane of symmetry
 of the zodiacal light would have no effect in producing the
 eccentricity; but the part resolved in that plane would, by the
 con<U+FB02>uence of the relative streams which pass by or through the
 sun, produce an elongation of the disturbance, or a kind of
 wake, in the quarter from which the un is moving. Thus the
 motions concerned in generating the luminous arch would not
 be the same in all directions from the sun. I shall not pursue
 this part of the subject further at present, because it will pro

             Mr..U.. D.'.Allen     Cesium and Rubidium.         189
bably not be safe to theorize upon it till the facts relating to the
degree of visibility of the arch in di<U+FB02>'erent seasons of the year
have been ascertained by observations taken at the equator, in
positions, such as that of Quito, where the in<U+FB02>uences of atmo
spheric changes are in a great degree eliminated. I will only
add one theoretical remark relative to the position of maximum
brightness, observed by Prof. Brorsen to be just opposite the
snn’s place. It appears to me that the explanation of this sin
gular fact must be wholly distinct from that of the luminous
arch. According to my theory of gravity-undulations, those
from the sun are propagated without impediment or retardation
through the body of the earth; but it cannot be a<U+FB01>irmed that
‘they undergo no modi<U+FB01>cation whatever. It seems reasonable to
 suppose that they partly consist of, or in their transmission give
 rise to, a small amount of undulations that are subject in a.
 slight degree to retardation and consequent refraction, and that
 to an eifect of the convergence of these undulations the pheno
 menon in question may be attributed. In the “ Theory of the
 Force of Gravity” (Phil. Mag. for December, 1859), I have sug
 gested that a similar modi<U+FB01>cation of terrestrial gravity-undula
 tions might account for the observed excess of gravity in insular
 positions, and for deviations of the plumb-line noticed in India.
    The concurrence and consentaneity of different parts of the
 general physical theory in the foregoing explanations, embracing
 both the zodiacal light and the associated phenomenon of the
 luminous arch, ought, I think, to be regarded as some evidence
 of the truth of the theory.

 XXV. Observations on Cresium and Rubidium.             By Oscars 1).
     ALLEN, P/i.B., Assistant in the Sbe<U+FB02>ield Laboratory, Yale Col
     lege, U.S.*
  THE discovery of the presence of the new elements rubidium
          and caesium in several varieties of European lepidolite,
  made it a subject of interesting inquiry to ascertain whether
  American lepidolite would not also serve as a source for these
  rare metals.
     A preliminary experiment made last autumn by Mr. John M.
  Blake and myself having shown that the lepidolite from Hebron
  in Maine contains these alkalies in comparative abundance, I
  was led to visit that locality, and there obtained the material
  which served for the following investigation.
          ' From Silliman’s American Journal for November 1862.

 190          Mr. O. D. Allen on Cesium and Rubidium.
     Lepidolite occurs at Hebron in large quantity, in a coarsely
 crystalline granite, associated with red and green tourmaline
 and albite. It has a granular and at the same time foliated
crystalline structure, a pale rose to violet colour, and very closely
resembles the lepidolite of Penig in Saxony, and, like that, is also
associated with the rare species amblygonite.
     Preparation of the salts of Czesium and Rubidium from the
Hebron Lepz'd0lite.——The process used for decomposing this
mineral was based upon that employed by Prof. J. Lawrence
 Smith for the determination of alkalies in silicates. Ten parts
of the pulverized lepidolite were <U+FB01>rst mixed with forty parts of
coarsely powdered quicklime; a mixture of enough water to
 slake the quicklime, with hydrochloric acid su<U+FB02>icient to form’
from six to seven parts of chloride of calcium, was next made
ready; the two mixtures were then united, and stirred vigorously
during the process of slaking, thus intimately blending the
mineral with suitable proportions of dry hydrate of lime and
chloride of calcium.
     It was found by experiment that practically as good results
 were obtained when the lepidolite was powdered su<U+FB01>iciently <U+FB01>ne
 to pass ‘a sieve of 20 holes to the linear inch as when it was
 more <U+FB01>nely pulverized, the fact being that the foliated structure
of the mineral exposes a large surface to the decomposing agency
 of the lime mixture.
     The mixture was heated to redness for six to eight hours in
 Hessian crucibles. Care was taken to avoid a heat much above
 redness, as otherwise the alkaline chlorides volatilize in dense
 clouds, and, the mass fusing, is absorbed to a considerable extent
 into the crucible and lost.    The long duration of the ignition
 was a matter of convenience, due to the character of the furnace
 employed, and probably not necessary to the decomposition of
the mineral.
' The agglomerated product obtained from the ignition of this
 mixture was detached from the crucibles and boiled with water
 till all but a trace of the chlorides was removed. The solution
 thus procured, containing chloride of calcium and the chlorides
of the alkali-metals, was evaporated till crystals began to form ;
 then sulphuric acid was added as long as sulphate of lime sepa
rated, taking care to avoid an excess, and the whole mass was
evaporated to dryness, and strongly heated to expel free hydro
chloric acid.    The residue was treated with water, and the small
quantity of sulphate of lime which passed into solution was pre
cipitated by carbonate of ammonia ; the <U+FB01>ltered solution was again
evaporated to dryness and ignited.
    Ten and a half kilogrammes of lepidolite treated in this way
afforded 2169 grammes of salts consisting of chlorides, with a

              Mr. 0. 1). Allen on Cerium and Rubidium.              191
 small‘ admixture of sulphates, of sodium, lithium, potassium,
 rubidium, and caesium. This quantity of salts, subjected to
 Bunsen’s process of fractional precipitation with bichloride of
 platinum, furnished 132 grammes of the platinochlorides of
 caesium and rubidium, in which no potassium could be detected
 with the spectroscope. The platinochlorides were very gently
 heated in a current of hydrogen gas until complete reduction of
 the platinum took place, and the chlorides were then extracted
 with water.
    The percentages of caesium and rubidium obtained from the
 mineral by this process were calculated from the amount of
 chlorine contained in these mixed chlorides.
    O'5825 grm., dissolved in water and precipitated with nitrate
 of silver, gave O'5835 grin. of chloride of silver, which represents
 0'14-39 grm. of chlorine.
    These numbers furnish the following equations :
                    Rb+Cs=O'5825—0-1439, . . . . (1)
                      Rb            Cs _o-1439                       2
                    85-36*+123-35*— 35-5." ' ' ' (l
 which give Cs=O'3002 and Rb=O'1384. According to these
 proportions, the 132 grammes of platinochlorides contained
 31'1969 grammes of caesium, 14~'3826 grammes of rubidium,
 which numbers respectively correspond to 0'3 per cent. and 0'14
 per cent. of the mineral-employed.
    It appears, therefore, that it is practicable to extract almost
 one-half per cent. of the two metals from the Hebron lepidolite,
 even when operating on a large scale, and in a somewhat crude
 manner. In separating the platinochlorides of caesium and rubi
 dium from the platinochloride of potassium, a not inconsiderable
 amount of these metals went into solution with the potassium
 salt, thus materially diminishing the quantity obtained. Much
 the larger proportion of this loss was rubidium, due to the greater
 solubility of its platinochloride. On comparing these results
 with Cooper’s analyses1' of the Rozena lepidolite, it appears that,
 although not quite so rich in rubidium, the Hebron mineral is
 remarkably rich in caesium. The lepidolite from Rozena and
 Zinnwald contain, according to the published analyses, only an
unweighable trace of caesium, while that from Hebron contains
 more than three-tenths of 1 per cent.
    Experiments in separating Cesium and Rubidium.——The process
 described by Bunsen for separating the new alkalies appeared to V
 be so troublesome, requiring for the preparation of pure rubi
   ' Combining proportions of caesium and rubidium determined by Bunsen
(Poggendor<U+FB02>"s Armulen, vol. cxiii. p. 339).

192         Mr. O. D. Allen on Cesium and Rubidium.
 dium-salts twenty to thirty extractions of the carbonates with
 boiling absolute alcohol (Phil. Mag. for July 1862, p. 50),
that I have made various attempts to discover a simpler
method.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place, a trial was made with the picrates of the new
metals. To a concentrated solution of their mixed chlorides an
alcoholic solution of picric acid was added. The liquid imme
diately <U+FB01>lled with <U+FB01>ne acicular crystals. These were rinsed with
water and successively recrystallized from fresh portions of water
eleven times.   Portions of the <U+FB01>rst, second, third, fourth, seventh,
and eleventh crops of crystals were separately examined in the
spectroscope, the picrates being converted into chlorides for this
purpose by treatment with aqua regia. No difference being
observable between the spectra of the various crops, no further
experiments were made in this direction. It may be here
remarked that the mixed picrates crystallize with great facility
in needles an inch in length, and perfectly resemble the corre
sponding potassium-salt.
   A second series of trials was made with the platinobromides
of potassium, rubidium, and caesium. The platinobromide of
potassium is known to be readily soluble in water. The platino
bromides of cmsium and rubidium readily separate from dilute
solutions of these three metals, but carry down potassium
with them. For the removal of the latter metal from the new
alkalies, the platinobromides appear to .have no advantage over
the platinochlorides, while they are equally inadequate to the
separation of caesium and rubidium from each other. In ex
ternal characters the three platinobromides closely resemble
each other.
   Finally, recourse was had to the bitartrates, and with satisfac
tory results. Carbonates of caesium and rubidium were <U+FB01>rst
prepared from the chlorides by converting them into sulphates,
separating the sulphuric acid with caustic baryta, and removing
the excess of baryta by carbonic acid. To the alkaline solution
thus obtained, twice as much tartaric acid was added as was
necessary to neutralize it. This solution was concentrated till it
was nearly saturated at 100° C. The crystals which deposited
on cooling, when examined by the spectroscope, showed the
rubidium lines more intensely than did the original mixture,
while the caesium lines were much fainter. This product was
dissolved and recrystallized from hot saturated solutions three
times. The caesium reaction in these successive crops diminished
until in the fourth it disappeared, leaving the rubidium spectrum
in entire purity.
   In order to ascertain whether the more soluble bitartrate of
caesium could be puri<U+FB01>ed. from rubidium by fractional crystalli

             Mr. O. D. Allen on Cresium and Rubidium.              19.3
 zation, the solution from which the <U+FB01>rst crystals had been removed
 was concentrated to nearly one-half its original volume, when,
 by cooling, a very small quantity of salts of the two alkalies was
 deposited. This operation was repeated three times, when a
 portion of the solution, evaporated to dryness and examined by
 the spectroscope, gave only the lines belonging to cazsium. The
 several intermediate products containing both alkalies were then
 united, and another portion of each salt separated from them in
 the same manner. By repeating this process of fractional cry
 stallization four times with about 40 grammes of the mixed salts,
2377 grammes of bitartrate of caesium, and 12511 grammes of
bitartrate of rubidium were obtained, while 3'74 grammes re
mained unseparated. It was found that the caesium-‘salt thus
obtained, although exhibiting no impurity when tested by the
spectroscope directly, i. e. after conversion by ignition into car
bonate, was still mixed with a trace of rubidium, as on converting
it into chloride a faint line characteristic of the latter metal was
perceptible. The separation of two or three more small crops of
crystals su<U+FB02>iced to render the residual solution perfectly free
from any admixture that could be detected by a spectroscope of
ordinary power*. The rubidium-salt was also more carefully
‘tested in the same manner, but was found to be entirely pure.
_ The process above described thus furnishes a simple and easy
method of separating in a perfectly pure state a large share (in
these trials about 90 per cent.) of a mixture of the two alkalies.
It requires no great expenditure of time, since the solutions em
ployed can be concentrated at high temperatures, and, on cooling,
immediately deposit well-formed crystals.

    III. 87625 grms. of solution, saturated at 25° C., gave a
 residue of 0'7727 grin.
    One part of the salt accordingly requires 10'32 parts of water
 at 25° C. for solution. ‘
    The fact that bitrartrate of rubidium requires about eight
 times as much water for solution as bitartrate of caesium, explains
 the facility with which these salts can be separated from each
 other by crystallization.
    In these experiments I have received the advice and assistance
 of Professors Johnson and Brush, for which I here take pleasure
 in expressing my most grateful acknowledgments*.

   “ Since the above was written I have recovered, from the mother-li uora
and washings of the 132 grammes platinochlorides of caesium and rubi ium
<U+FB01>rst obtained, an additional quantity of potash-free platinochlorides (chie<U+FB02>y
of rubidium) amounting to 40 grammes, making the total yield 172 grammes
from 104 kilogrammes of lepidolite. Most of this remained in solution from
the use of insu<U+FB02>icient bichloride of platinum in some of the precipitations.
The amount of rubidium in the Hebron lepidolite thus appears to be not
less than in that from Rozena.

       XXVI. On the Equivalent and Spectrum of Cesium.
             By S. W. JOHNSON and O. D. ALLEN *.
IN the preceding article a method is described of separating
      caesium from rubidium by fractional crystallization of the
bitartrates of these metals. The analyses of the bitartrate of
cwsium there given, while perfectly according with each other
as regards carbon, disagree with the numbers deduced from
Bunsen’s equivalent to such an extent that we have undertaken
to ascertain whether the salt was impure or Bunsen’s equivalent
incorrect.
    From the great care used in preparing the bitartrate, and
especially from the fact that its spectrum remained unaltered
though the salt was repeatedly recrystallized, we were inclined
to suppose that Bunsen had not operated with a pure substance.
    This might easily happen, on account of the small quantity
of material at his disposal, without at all detracting from the
merit of this distinguished chemist.
   A quantity of bitartrate of caesium, puri<U+FB01>ed by concentrating
its solution and recrystallization, as described in the paper re
ferred to, and containing no foreign matters recognizable by the
spectroscope, except an inevitable trace of sodium and (to judge
from a certain red line) perhaps some lithium, was treated directly
with bichloride of platinum in quantity sutlicient for complete
precipitation. This platinochloride of caesium, after thorough
washing, was reduced in hydrogen, the chloride of caesium dis
solved from the platinum and evaporated to dryness with addi
tion of a little hydrochloric acid.
   We thus obtained an amorphous mass of a pure white colour,
which, unlike Bunsen’s chloride, was not perceptibly deliguescenf
even in a. very moist atmosphere. The spectrum of the chloride
thus prepared was identical with that of the original bitartrate.
Both salts gave a red line nearly coincident with the ac line of
lithium. In order to determine whether this line was due to a
trace of lithium, or belongs to the spectrum of caesium, a por
tion of chloride was again precipitated with a relatively small
quantity of bichloride of platinum, the precipitate was most
thoroughly washed, and from it a new sample of chloride of
caesium was prepared. The red line was no less apparent in
this than in the former preparations. The same process of
partial precipitation was repeated a third time without altering
the spectrum.
    Again, from a hot dilute solution of 15 grms. of chloride of
caesium, about 1 grin. of caesium was thrown down as platino
chloride; the product thus procured gave a spectrum identical
with that from the original bitartrate.

     We concluded from these experiments that our chloride of
 caesium was free from lithium, and as pure as it is well possible
 to obtain _any substance without the most extraordinary and for
 most purposes unreasonable precautions.
     As to the properties of the chloride of caesium, we observed that
 not only is it not deliquescent, but it is hardly hygroscopic. The
 unfused and porous salt may be weighed in moist air with as much
 accurac as chloride of sodium. After it has been fused it does
 not alte)i' in weight during twenty-four hours’ exposure to the
 air in cold dry weather. It may be fused in a platinum capsule
 over the gas-<U+FB02>ame when the air is dry without acquiring an alka
 line reaction. In a damp atmosphere it is apt to lose chlorine
 during fusion. The residue, after the reduction of platinochlo
 ride of caesium by hydrogen at a gentle heat, is alkaline. It is
 hardly possible to fuse chloride of caesium without loss by vola
tilization.       Hence our <U+FB01>rst estimations of caesium in this form
 were too low by 4- to 7-tenths of 1 per cent.
     For determining the equivalent of caesium we have made four
chlorine-estimations. Two of these (I. and II.) were made in
 the chloride obtained as already described. Their details and
results are given below. The <U+FB01>ltrates from these analyses,
containing nitrates of caesium and silver, after the latter had
been removed, were added to a solution of several grammes of
 the original chloride, and the whole was partially precipitated
 with bichloride of platinum, and a second portion of chloride of
caesium procured, on which determination III. was made. Finally,
the nitrate of caesium from this analysis was mingled with repeat
edly puri<U+FB01>ed chloride obtained in the previous study of the.spec
trum ; about half the caesium was again thrown down as platino
chloride, and with this product another estimation of chlorine
 (IV.) was made.
     The determination of chlorine was conducted in the usual
 manner, by precipitation with nitrate of silver and <U+FB01>ltration.
 Washed Swedish <U+FB01>lters were employed, which gave each an ash
weighing four-tenths of a milligramme. The weighingswere taken
 on a balance by Becker and Sons, of Brooklyn, New York, which
 with an ordinary load indicates one-twentieth of a milligramme
 with great decision and perfect constancy.
     The data of our determinations are as follows :—

    We may accordingly assume the round number (133) as the
equivalent of caesium.
    Calculated by this equivalent, the formula of bitartrate of
caesium corresponds well with the results of experiment. As

     The equivalent number (133) brings caesium into a triad with
 rubidium and potassium. We have then two alkali triads, viz.
 lithium (eq. 7), sodium (eq. 23), and potassium (eq. 39'l),

                      and Spectrum of Cesium.                   199
   The caesium spectrum, as we have procured it, is perhaps,
from the number, colour, and de<U+FB01>nition of its lines, the most
beautiful to be observed among all the alkali and earthy metals.
Kirchhoff and Bunsen, in the <U+FB01>gure given by them (Philosophical
Magazine, vol. xxii. 1861), represent eleven lines. We <U+FB01>nd
without di<U+FB02>iculty seven more lines, and observe further that some
of those <U+FB01>gured by Kirchhoff and Bunsen are not mapped in
their correct positions. To enable other chemists to compare
their caesium preparations with ours, we will attempt to describe
the caesium spectrum as seen in our instrument, which has a
single <U+FB02>int-glass prism.
   Beginning at the left or red extremity of the spectrum, we
will indicate the lines in the order of their occurrence by Roman
numerals: I. is a red line of medium brightness nearly equi
distant between the Fraunhofer lines a and B ; II. is a bright line
partly coincident with, but slightly to the left of and narrower
than the at line of lithium ; III. is a faint line nearly approach
ing Fraunhofer’s line C; IV. is the faintest of the red lines;
V. is a. faint line midway between the at and B lines of lithium;
VI. is a bright red line midway between the sodium line and at
lithium; VII. is an orange-red line of medium intensity directly
to the right of the at strontium line; VIII. is a <U+FB01>ne yellow line
just to the right of and close upon the sodium line. The posi
tion of the green lines it is di<U+FB01>icult to describe. First comes a
group of three, IX. X. and XI., which are separated by very
narrow spaces, and which are represented well in the spectrum
plate of Kirchhoff and Bunsen, though placed a tri<U+FB02>e too far to
the right.    Then, after an interval scarcely wider than the lines
themselves, come XII. and XIII., which are very near each‘other.
After another space as broad as these lines we encounter XIV.
Midway between XIV. and XVI. is XV. The latter (XV.) coin
cides with the dark line E. Finally, the two pale blue lines
XVII. and XVIII. complete the list.
   For the convenience of those who may use spectroscopes of
the same construction as ours, we will mention the degrees on
the scale of our instrument which correspond to the caesium
lines. In our observations we have brought the degree 100 (10
on the scale) into the sodium line. Then the blue of strontium
is at 156°, the violet of potassium 257°, the red of potassium at
65-66°, the red of lithium at 80—81°. With this adjustment the
caesium lines are as follows, beginning with the red: I. 75°,
II. 80°, III. 82—3°, IV. 85°, V. 87—8°, VI. 91°, VII. 97—8°,
VIII. 101°, IX. 106°, X. 107—8°, XI. 109°, XII. 111°, XIII.
112-1 3°, XIV. 114-15°, XV. 118°, XVI. 121°, XVII. 157—58°,
XVIII. 160°.

  20                                            and too far to the right. Finally, we observe a <U+FB01>ne yel

  XXVII. On Radiation through the Earth’s Atmosphere. By
                  JOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy,
     ' Royal Institution*.
                                OBODY ever obtained the idea of a line from Euclid’s
                                             de<U+FB01>nition that it is length without breadth. The idea is
  obtained from a real physical line drawn by a pen or pencil, and
  therefore possessing width,-—the idea being afterwards brought,
  by a process of abstraction, more nearly into accordance with the
  conditions of the de<U+FB01>nition. So also with regard to physical
                   * From the Proceedings of the Royal Institution for Jan. 23,‘ 1863.

                 through the Earth’s Atmosphere.               201
phenomena; we must help ourselves to a conception of them
visible by means of proper images derived from the visible, after
wards purifying our conceptions to the needful extent. De<U+FB01>nite
ness of conceptions, even though at some expense to delicacy, is
of the greatest utility in dealing with physical phenomena. In
deed it may be questioned whether a mind trained in physical
research can at all enjoy peace without having made clear to
itself some possible way of conceiving of those operations which
lie beyond the boundaries of sense, and in which sensible phe
nomena originate.
    When we speak of radiation through the atmosphere, we ought
to be able to affix de<U+FB01>nite physical ideas, both to the term atmo
 sphere and the term radiation. It is well known that our atmo
 sphere is mainly composed of the two elements oxygen and
 nitrogen. These elementary atoms may be <U+FB01>gured as small
 spheres scattered thickly in the space which immediately sur
 rounds the earth. They constitute about 99% per cent. of
 the atmosphere. Mixed with these atoms we have others of a
 totally different character; we have the molecules, or atomic
 groups, of carbonic acid, of ammonia, and of aqueous vapour.
 In these substances diverse atoms have coalesced to form little
 systems of atoms. The molecule of aqueous vapour, for example,
 consists of two atoms of hydrogen united to one of oxygen ; and
 they mingle as little triads among the monads of oxygen and
 nitrogen which constitute the great mass of the atmosphere.
     These atoms and molecules are separate ; but in what sense?
 They are separate from each other in the sense in which the
 individual <U+FB01>shes of a shoal are separate. The shoal of <U+FB01>sh is
 embraced by a common medium, which connects the diiferent
 members of the shoal, and renders intercommunication between
 them possible. A medium also embraces our atoms ; within our
 atmosphere exists a second, anda <U+FB01>ner atmosphere, in which the
 atoms of oxygen and nitrogen hang like suspended grains.
 This <U+FB01>ner atmosphere unites not only atom with atom, but star
 with star; and the light of all suns and of all stars is in realit
  a kind of music propagated through this interstellar air. This
 -image must be clearly seized; and then we have to advance a
  step. We must not only <U+FB01>gure our atoms suspended in this
  medium, but we must <U+FB01>gure them vibrating in it. In this
  motion of the atoms consists what we call their heat. “ What
  is heat to us,” as Locke has perfectly expressed it, “is in the
  body heated nothing but motion.” Well, we must <U+FB01>gure this
  motion communicated to the medium in which the atoms swing,
  and sent in ripples through it with inconceivable velocity to the
  bounds of space. Motion in this form, unconnected with ordi
  nary matter, but speeding through the interstellar medium,

 receives the name of Radiant Heat; and if competent to excite
 the nerves of vision, we call it Light.
    Aqueous vapour was de<U+FB01>ned to be an invisible gas. Vapour
 was permitted to issue horizontally with considerable force from
 a tube connected with a small boiler. The track of the cloud
 of condensed steam was vividly illuminated by the electric light.
 What was seen, however, was not vapour, but vapour condensed
 to water. Beyond the visible end of the jet the cloud resolved
 itself into true vapour. A lamp was placed under the jet at
 various points; the cloud was cut sharply off at that point, and
 when the <U+FB02>ame was placed near the ef<U+FB02>ux ori<U+FB01>ce the cloud
 entirely disappeared. The heat of the lamp completely pre
 vented precipitation. This same vapour was condensed and
 congealed on the surface of a vessel containing a freezing-mix
 ture, from which it was scraped in quantities su<U+FB02>icient to form
 a small snowball. The beam of the electric lamp, moreover,
 was sent through a large receiver placed on an air-pump. A
 single stroke of the pump caused the precipitation of the aqueous
 vapour within, which became beautifully illuminated by the
 beam ; while, upon a screen behind, a richly coloured halo, due
 to diffraction by the little cloud within the receiver, <U+FB02>ashed forth.
    The waves of heat speed from our earth through our atmo
  phere towards space. These waves dash in their passage
 against the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen, and against the
 molecules of aqueous vapour. Thinly scattered as these latter
 are, we might naturally think meanly of them as barriers to the
 waves of heat. We might imagine that the wide spaces between
 the vapour-molecules would be an open door for the passage of
 the undulations, and that, if those waves were at all intercepted,
 it would be by the substances which form 99% per cent. of the
 whole atmosphere. Three or four years ago, however, it was
 found by the speaker that this small modicum of aqueous vapour
 intercepted <U+FB01>fteen times the quantity of heat stopped by the
 whole of the air in which it was diffused. It was afterwards
 found that the dry air then experimented with was not perfectly
 pure, and that the purer the air became the more it approached
the character of a vacuum, and the greater, by comparison,
became the action of the aqueous vapour. The vapour was
found to act with 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 times the energy of the
 air in which it was di<U+FB02>'used ; and no doubt was entertained that
the aqueous vapour of the air which <U+FB01>lled the Royal Institution
theatre during the delivery of the discourse, absorbed 90 or 100
times the quantity of radiant heat which was absorbed by the
main body of the air of the room.
    Looking at the single atoms, for every 200 of oxygen and
nitrogen there is about 1 of aqueous vapour. This 1, then, is

                   through the E'arth’s Atmosphere.              203
80 time more powerful than the 200 ; and hence, comparing a
single atom of oxygen or nitrogen with a single atom of aqueous
vapour, we may infer that the action of the latter is 16,000
times that of the former. This was a very astonishing result,
and it naturally excited opposition, based on the philosophic
reluctance to accept a result so grave in consequences before
testing it to the uttermost. From such opposition a discovery,
if it be worth the name, emerges with its <U+FB01>bre strengthened,
as the human character gathers force from the healthy antago
nisms of active life. It was urged that the result was on the
face of it improbable ; that there were, moreover, many ways of
accounting for it, without ascribing so enormous a comparative
action to aqueous vapour. For example, the cylinder which
contained the air in which these experiments were made, was
stopped at its ends by plates of rock-salt, on account of their
transparency to radiant heat. Rock-salt is hygroscopic; it
attracts the moisture of the atmosphere. Thus a layer of brine
readily forms on the surface of a plate of rock-salt; and it is
well known that brine is very impervious to the rays of heat.
Illuminating a polished plate of salt by the electric lamp, and
 casting, by means of a lens, a magni<U+FB01>ed image of the plate upon
a screen, the speaker breathed through a tube for a moment on
the salt; brilliant colours of thin plates (soap-bubble colours)
<U+FB02>ashed forth immediately upon the screen—these being caused
by the <U+FB01>lm of moisture which overspread the salt. Such a <U+FB01>lm,
it was contended, is formed when undried air is sent into the
cylinder; it was therefore the absorption of a layer of brine
which was measured, instead of the absorption of aqueous
vapour.
    This objection was met in two ways. First, by showing that
the plates of salt when subjected to the strictest examination
show no trace of a <U+FB01>lm of moisture. Secondly, by abolishing
the plates of salt altogether, and obtaining the same results in a
cylinder open at both ends.
    It was next surmised that the effect was due to the impurity of
the London air; and the suspended carbon-particles were pointed
to as the cause of the opacity to radiant heat. This objection
was met by bringing air from Hyde Park, Hampstead Heath,
 Primrose Hill, Epsom Downs, a <U+FB01>eld near Newport in the Isle
 of Wight, St. Catharine’s Down, and the sea-beach near Black
 Gang Chine. The aqueous vapour of the air from these localities
 intercepted at least seventy times the amount of radiant heat
 absorbed by the air in which the vapour was diffused. Experi
 ments made with smoky air proved that the suspended smoke of
 the atmosphere of West London, even when an east wind pours
 over it the smoke of the city, exerts only a fraction of the destruc

 204                  Prof. Tyndall on Radiation
 tive powers exercised by the transparent and impalpable aqueous
 vapour diffused in the air.
     The cylinder which contained the air through which the
 calori<U+FB01>c rays passed was polished within, and the rays which
 struck the interior surface were re<U+FB02>ected from it to the thermo
 electric pile which measured the radiation. The following
objection was raised :—You permit moist air to enter your
cylinder ; a portion of this moisture is condensed as a liquid <U+FB01>lm
upon the interior surface of your tube; its re<U+FB02>ective power is
thereby diminished ; less heat therefore reaches the pile, and you
incorrectly ascribe to the absorption of aqueous vapour an effect
which is really due to diminished re<U+FB02>exion of the interior surface
of your cylinder.
    But why should the aqueous vapour so condense? The tube
within is warmer than the air without, and against its inner
surface the rays of heat are impinging. There can be no
tendency to condensation under such circumstances. Further,
let <U+FB01>ve inches of undried air be sent into the tube, that is, one
sixth of the amount which      it can contain. These <U+FB01>\'e inches
produce their proportionate    absorption. The driest day, on the
driest portion of the earth’s  surface, would make no approach to
the dryness of our cylinder    when it contains only <U+FB01>ve inches of
air.    Make it 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 inches: you obtain an absorp
tion exactly proportional to the quantity of vapour present. It
is next to a physical impossibility that this could be the case if
the effect were due to condensation. But lest a doubt should
linger in the mind, not only were the plates of rock-salt abolished,
but the cylinder itself was dispensed with. Humid air was
displaced by dry, and dry air by humid in the free atmosphere ;
the absorption of the aqueous vapour was here manifest, as in all
the other cases.
    No doubt, therefore, can exist of the extraordinary opacity of
this substance to the rays of obscure heat ; and particularly such
rays as are emitted by the earth after it has been warmed by the
sun. It is perfectly certain that more than ten per cent. of the
terrestrial radiation from the soil of England is stopped within
ten feet of the surface of the soil. This one fact is su<U+FB01>icient to
show the immense in<U+FB02>uence which this newly- discovered property
of aqueous vapours must exert on the phenomena of meteoro
      .
lo g'I‘his aqueous vapour is a blanket more necessary to the
vegetable life of England than clothing is to man. Remove
for a single summer-night the aqueous vapour from the air
which overspreads this country, and you would assuredly destroy
every plant capable of being destroyed by a freezing temperature.
The warmth of our <U+FB01>elds and gardens would pour itself unre

                    through the Earth’s Atmosphere.              205'
  quited into space, and the sun would rise upon an island held
  fast in the iron grip of frost. The aqueous vapour constitutes
  a local dam, by which the temperature at the earth’s surface is
  deepened: the dam, however, <U+FB01>nally over<U+FB02>ows, and we give to
  space all that we receive from the sun.
     The sun raises the vapours of the equatorial ocean; they rise,
  but for a time a vapour screen spreads above and around them.
  But the higher they rise, the more they come into the presence
  of pure space, and when, by their levity, they have penetrated
  the vapour screen, which lies close to the earth’s surface, what
  must occur?
     It has been said that, compared atom for atom, the absorp
  tion of an atom of aqueous vapour is 16,000 times that of air.
  Now the power to absorb and the power to radiate are perfectly
' reciprocal and proportional. The atom of aqueous vapour will
  therefore radiate with 16,000 times the energy of an atom of
  air. Imagine then this powerful radiant in the presence of
  space, and with no screen above it to check its radiation. Into
  space it pours its heat, chills itself, condenses, and the tropical
  torrents are the consequence. The expansion of the air, no
  doubt, also refrigerates it; but in accounting for those deluges,
  the chilling of the vapour by its own radiation must play a most
  important part. The rain quits the ocean as vapour; it returns
  to it as water.    How are the vast stores of heat, set free by the
  change from the vaporous to the liquid condition, disposed of ‘E
  Doubtless in great part they are wasted by radiation into space.
  Similar remarks apply to the cumuli of our latitudes. The
  warmed air, charged with vapour, rises in columns, so as to
  penetrate the vapour screen which hugs the earth; in the pre
  sence of space, the head of each pillar wastes its heat by radi
  ation, condenses to a cumulus, which constitutes the visible
  capital of an invisible column of saturated air.
     Numberless other meteorological phenomena receive their
  solution by reference to the radiant and absorbent properties
  of aqueous vapour. It is the absence of this screen, and the
  consequent copious waste of heat, that causes mountains to be
  so much chilled when the sun is withdrawn. Its absence in
  Central Asia renders the winter there almost unendurable; in
  Sahara the dryness of the air is sometimes such that, though
  during the day “the soil is <U+FB01>re and the wind is <U+FB02>ame,” the
  chill at night is painful to bear. In Australia, also, the ther
  mometric range is enormous, on account of the absence of this
  qualifying agent. A clear day, and a dry day, moreover, are very
  different things. The atmosphere may possess great visual clear
  ness, while it is charged with aqueous vapour; and on such occa
  sions great chilling cannot occur by terrestrial radiation. Sir

206           Mr. A. Cayley on Thorema relating to the
John Leslie and others have been perplexed by the varying indi
cations of their instruments on days equally bright ; but all these
anomalies are completely accounted for by reference to this
newly-discovered property of transparent aqueous vapour. Its
presence would check the earth’s loss ; its absence, without
sensibly altering the transparency of the air, would open wide
a door for the escape of the earth’s heat into in<U+FB01>nitude.
   XXVIII. Theorems relating to the Canonic Roots of a Binary
          Quantic of an Odd Order. By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
I CALL to mind Professor Sylvester’s theory of the canonical
       form of a binary quantic of an odd order; viz., the quantic
of the order 2n+ 1 may be expressed as a sum of n+1(2n+ 1)th
powers, the roots of which, or say the canonic roots of the quantic,
are to constant multipliers pres the factors of a certain covariant
derivative of the order (n+1), called the Canonizant. If, to <U+FB01>x
the ideas, we take a quintic function, then we may write
 (a,b,v,d,e,fIw,y)°=A(l¢+1"y)5+A'(l'¢+'"'3/)5+A"(l"¢+"1"!/)5
(it would be allowable to put the coe<U+FB01>icients A each equal to
unity; but there is a convenience in retaining them, and in con
sidering that a canonic root lz'+my is only given as regards the
ratio l : m, but that the coef<U+FB01>cients l, m remain indeterminate) ;
and then the canonic roots (l.z'+1ny), &c. are the factors of the
Canonizant

   It is to be observed that this reduction of the quantic to its
canonical form, 1'. e. to a sum of n+ 1 (2n_+ 1)th powers, is a
unique one, and that the quantic cannot be in any other manner
a sum of n + l (2n+ l)th powers.                         _
   Prof. Sylvester communicated to me, under a slightly less
general form, and has permitted me to publish the following
theorems :—                                                      _
    1. If the second emanant (XB,+YBy)*U has in common with
the quantic U a single canonic root, then all the canonic roots
of the emanant are canonic roots of the quantic; and, moreover,
if the remaining canonic root of the quantic be r.r+s_z/,_then
(X, Y), the facients of emanation, are =_ (s, —r), or, what is the
same thing, they are given by the equation
                canont. U(X, Y in place of .z', y)=0.

 which must be an identity ; for otherwise we should have the
 same cubic function expressed in two different canonical forms.
 And we may write
          B'=cI:     l"z'+m’l/=P'z+ql/I        B”:-'0:       C;-B:
 and then we have
            (XB,+ YBy)"U=B(l.z'+my)5+ B'(l'.z'+m'y)3;
 so that all the canonic roots of the emanant are canonic roots of
 the quantic. Moreover, the condition B"=O gives l"X + m"Y=O,
 that is, X : Y=m" : —l", or writing r.1:+syinstead of l".z'+m" ,
 X: Y=s : —r; and the system is
                     U = A(l.z' + my)5 + A’ (l'.z' + m'_1/)5 + A (r.z- + sy)"’,
       (sB,— 1'81,) 9U = B(l.z' + my)3 + B'(l'z' + m'y)3,
which proves the theorem.
    2. The two functions, canont. U, canont. (XB‘+ YB,)’U, have
for their resultant {canont. U(X, Y in place of a', y) }’", if 2n+ 1
be the order of U.
    In fact, in order that the equations
            canont. U =0, canont. (XE: + YB,)’U= 0,
may coexist, their resultant must vanish ; and conversely, when
the resultant vanishes, the equations will have a common root.
Now if the equation canont. (XB,+YBy)‘2U=O has a common
root with the equation canont. U=O, all its roots are roots of
canont. U=O; and, moreover, if r.z'+sy=O be the remaining
root of canont. U=0, then X : Y=s :—r, that is, we have
                canont. U(X, Y in place of .z', y) =0 ,
or the resultant in question can only vanish if the last-mentioned
equation is satis<U+FB01>ed. It follows that the resultant must be a

 power of the nil/'actum of the equation ; and observing that
 canont. U is of the form (a, . . .)”+1(.z', y)"+1_, 2'. e. that it is of the
 degree 11+ 1 as well in regard to the coef<U+FB01>cients as in regard to
 the variables (av, y), it is easy to see that the resultant is of the
 degree 2n(n+ 1) as well in regard to the coefficients as in regard
to (X, Y) ; that is, we have 2n as the index of the power in
 question.
    3. In particular, if Y=O, the theorem is that the resultant of
the functions canont. U, canont. BZU is equal to the 2nth power
of the <U+FB01>rst coefficient of canont. U.
    Thus for n= 1, that is, for the cubic function (a, b, c, die‘, 3/)’,
we have
             canont. U=          y*, —.z-y,    w‘

           XXIX. Experiments on Ozone.            By M. SORET.
                 In a Letter to Professor TYNDALL *.
YOU have perhaps remarked that I have made a note of one
        or two observations relative to ozone. This leads me to
say a few words to you on some experiments which I have since
then made on this subject in M. Bunsen’s laboratory. I had
formerly ascertained (Archive, 1854, vol. xxv. p. 263) that the
quantity of ozone is greatly increased when the voltameter is
cooled, as you have also found.          I had made some analyses by
arsenious acid, but the method was not perfect. I resumed
experiments of the same kind, using M. Bunsen’s method with
sulphurous acid and a standard solution of iodide of potassium.
                  * Communicated by Professor Tyndall.

                        M. Soret on Ozone.                     209
My <U+FB01>rst idea was to try and ascertain whether less or more ozone
was produced in light than in darkness.        I found no appre
ciable di<U+FB01>erence, but I found that, with the voltameter which I
used, I produced even at ordinary temperatures very considerable
proportions of ozone. I worked with a voltameter of 500 to
700 cubic centims. capacity, <U+FB01>lled with acidulated water (one
volume of SO3 HO to <U+FB01>ve volumes of water), with very <U+FB01>ne wires
of platinum-iridium for electrodes; the negative electrode was
surrounded by a porous cell, and the gases were consequently
not mixed. I obtained at ordinary temperatures, much higher
than that of 0°, a quantity of ozone varying with the circum
stances, but amounting almost to I per cent. for the whole of
the oxygen disengaged. The gas appeared to be capable of
being dried by passing through sulphuric acid without appreci
able loss of ozone. By surrounding the voltameter with a mix
ture of ice and salt, and allowing the oxygen to pass directly
into iodide of potassium, I obtained a quantity of iodine corre
 sponding to 20 niilligramnies of oxygen; the oxygen collected,
after passing through the iodide, <U+FB01>lled a <U+FB02>ask of 720 cubic cen
tims. capacity. If, then, we assume that the 20 milligrammes of
                                                                2
oxygen absorbed represent ozone, we obtain a proportion of
                                                               105'
By collecting the gas under water, and absorbing with iodide of
potassium after all the gas has been disengaged, less oxygen is
found, because water dissolves a considerable proportion (about
one-<U+FB01>fth of the ozone liberated in an experiment in which the
water was analysed).
   These proportions are then very appreciable ; and the essential
conditions for obtaining them appear to be—
    1. The use of large voltameters, to avoid the heating by the
passage of the current, and perhaps a perturbing action of the
oxygenized water.
   2. The separation of the gases.
    3. The use of electrodes of platinum-iridium exercises possibly
also an in<U+FB02>uence.
    4. The cooling of the voltameter.
    5. The use of a su<U+FB01>iciently concentrated solution of sulphuric
acid.
   I availed myself of the facility of the production of ozone to
repeat Baumert’s fundamental experiment, in which dried elec
trolytic oxygen, passed into a glass tube coated with a slight
layer of anhydrous phosphoric acid, dissolves this deposit if the
tube has been heated at one point—an experiment which, accord
ing to Baumert, proves that ozone contains hydrogen. In
operating with a voltameter in which the two gases were disen
gaged (they were separated by a porous cell), I found in fact

that water was formed by heating the disengaged oxygen.            _But
by effecting the decomposition in a large vessel containing acidu.
lated water in which the positive electrode was placed, and a
large porous cell <U+FB01>lled with sulphate of copper in which the nev
gative electrode was placed, so that there was no disengagement
of hydrogen, there was not the smallest trace of water in the
oxygen after its passage through the heated tube. I prove, then,
that in Baumert’s experiment, as M. Marignac had supposed,
it is an imperfect separation of the gases which has led him to
a. conclusion dilferent from that usually admitted.
    I continue to work at this subject, but I have thought that
these <U+FB01>rst results might possess some interest for you, and hence
I have taken the liberty of communicating them to you before
my investigation is terminated and ready for publication.

 heat, according to Regnaultt, is 003355. It is diamagnetic,
 and a bad conductor of heat and electricity. The aqueous solu
 tions of its salts are precipitated neither by alkalies nor alkaline
 carbonates, nor by dilute solution of red or yellow prussiate of
 potash. Hydrochloric acid produces a white precipitate of di<U+FB02>i
 cultly soluble chloride; iodide of potassium and chloride of pla
 tinum yield a yellow iodide, and a double chloride still more
 insoluble.
     Sulphuretted hydrogen produces no precipitate in acid solu
 tions, and only a partial one in neutral solutions; it precipitates
 the metal as black sulphide from alkaline solutions. Zinc pre
 cipitates the metal from its various solutions, in brilliant laminae.
     Thallium forms with oxygen two oxides. The protoxide is
 soluble in water, which it renders alkaline and caustic; it absorbs
  carbonic acid from the air, forming a carbonate insoluble in
  alcohol. In the solid state the oxide is yellow or black, accord
  ing as it is hydrated or not. Its colourless solution, evaporated
  in vacuo, deposits long bundles of yellowish prismatic needles,
  which blacken as evaporation proceeds, so that at a certain stage
  of desiccation there is a curious mixture of yellow and black
  crystals. The protoxide melts above 300° to a brown volatile
  liquid which attacks porcelain, taking from it a portion of silica.

           M. Kuhlmann on the Extraction of Thallium.            211
    When the dry protoxide is heated with absolute alcohol it is
 dissolved, and a thallic alcohol formed analogous to potassic
alcohol. It is a limpid oil of the speci<U+FB01>c gravity 3'50, and
scarcely less refrangible than bisulphide of carbon. It is little
soluble in alcohol, and is decomposed by water, forming pure
protoxide of thallium.
    When thallium is completely burned in oxygen, it forms an
insoluble black oxide of the composition ThO3. This melts at a
red heat and disengages oxygen. It forms salts with hydro
chloric, sulphuric, and nitric acids, which are not very stable.
   When sesquichloride of thallium is treated with potash, a
brown oxide is precipitated, and protochloride of thallium remains
in solution. This oxide unites with acids more readily than the
black oxide, from which it di<U+FB01>"ers by containing an equivalent of
water.
   The carbonate of thallium, Tho CO9, dissolves to the extent of
about 5 per cent. in water at the ordinary temperature, and to
about 22 in water at 100° C.      It crystallizes in long, <U+FB02>attened,
prismatic needles, readily fusible to a grey mass whose density
is 7'06.
   The sulphate, ThO S03, crystallizes in beautiful oblique rhombic
prisms, somewhat less soluble than the carbonate.
    The nitrate, Th0 N05, is the most soluble of the salts of thal
lium. 100 grms. of water at 18° dissolve 9'75 grms., and 580
grms. at a temperature of 107°.                                     '
    Thallium appears to form three chlorides. The most stable is
the protochloride, ThCl, which has great analogy with chloride of
silver, except in the matter of solubility. The sesquichloride of
thallium, Th2 C13, forms beautiful yellow hexagonal plates, soluble
without decomposition in acidulated water to the extent of about
5 per cent. It melts at 400° to a brown volatile liquid, and
solidi<U+FB01>es to a yellowish-brown mass, the density of which is 5'90.
    Boththese chlorides appear capable of absorbing 1 to 1'5
 equivalent of chlorine to form unstable perchlorides, which heat
alone decomposes.
    Although the metal thallium has, by means of the spectro
 scope, been found to exist in several specimens of pyrites from
 different sources, yet Bottger, who had tried to detect its
presence in a great many samples of the deposits in sulphuric
acid works in which pyrites is burned, was not able to do so;
Kuhlmann, in the deposits from whose works Lamy extracted
thallium, describes* their exceptional construction, which per
mitted the accumulation of large quantities of this substance.

212          M. Bunsen on the Preparation of Rubidium.
    The sulphuric acid from the combustion of pyrites contains
arsenic. To get rid of this, Kuhlmann placed a. supplementary
chamber before the ordinary chambers in which the sulphurous
acid is converted into sulphuric acid, which was so large that
the gases becoming cooled deposited not only substances mecha
nically carried away, but also volatile substances readily con
densed, and especially arsenious acid. After some months of
a combustion of about 3000 kilogrammes of pyrites per diem,
considerable masses of arsenic and selenium are deposited, along
with mercury and thallium, amounting in some parts of the
deposit to § per cent.
     In works where this plan is not adopted, any thallium which
might be contained in pyrites would mix with the sulphate of
lead covering the <U+FB02>oor of the <U+FB01>rst chamber, and would dissolve
in the sulphuric acid as fast as it was formed, so that the deposits
of sulphate of lead would contain traces of this substance so
small as to be inappreciable even to the spectroscope.
     The following observations on the preparation of rubidium
have been communicated by Prof. Bunsen in a. letter to Prof.
Dumas*.
     The material for the purpose was extracted from the lepido
lite residues left in the preparation of lithium. In separating
caesium from rubidium, use was made of the di<U+FB02>'ei'ence in solubility
of the neutral tartrate of caesium (which is deliquescent), and of
the bitartrate of rubidium, which is very little soluble 1-.
     The reduction of carbonate of rubidium by charcoal is more
di<U+FB01>icult than that of sodium, and less so than that of potassium.
To effect it, the following mixture was heated in a potassium
furnace: 89% parts of bitartrate of rubidium, 8% parts of tartrate
of lime, and 2 parts of lampblack from turpentine. The metal
was received in a vessel containing naphtha ; 5 grammes of metal
were obtained from 75 grammes of bitartrate.
     The metal melts at 38°'5, and its speci<U+FB01>c gravity is 1-516.
According to recent determinations at Heidelberg, sodium melts
 at 95°'6, potassium at 62°'5, and lithium at 180°.
, Like potassium, rubidium burns on water with a rotatory
motion, and in its other properties has the greatest analogy with
that element.
     M. Dietzenbacheri has observed that the presence of a small
quantity of chlorine, bromine, or iodine modi<U+FB01>es the properties
of sulphur to a remarkable extent. When a mixture of 400
parts of sulphur and 1 part of iodine is heated to about 180°,

 on cooling, 9. sulphur is produced which remains for a long time
 elastic, and which, when poured on a glass or porcelain plate, is
 obtained in <U+FB02>exible sheets. The same change is produced by
 iodide of potassium, or by even a smaller proportion of iodine.
 The sulphur thus prepared is insoluble in bisulphide of carbon.
      The action of 1 per cent. of bromine at a temperature of 200°
 is similar; but the sulphur, instead of being black and having a
 metallic lustre, has the colour of yellow wax, and is much softer
 than the foregoing variety : about 75 to 80 per cent. are insoluble
in bisulphide.
      Chlorine passed over sulphur at 240° changes it into a kind
 of soft sulphiir, which can be readily drawn out and the parts
 stuck together. It contains a rather larger proportion of sul
 phur soluble in bisulphide than that treated by bromine. After
 having been worked up for an hour or two it suddenly hardens,
 and then becomes quite insoluble in bisulphide of carbon.
      M. Kiimmerer* has made the following observations on the
isolation of <U+FB02>uorine. In a perfectly dry tube, iodine was intro
 duced along with a small tube closed with a stopper and <U+FB01>lled
 with <U+FB02>uoride of silver in excess. The tube was sealed after
 expelling all air by the vapour of iodine, and then, having
broken the small tube in the interior, the apparatus was heated
to 70° or 80°. At the expiration of twenty-four hours all the
iodine had disappeared, the tube was perfectly transparent,'and
its contents colourless. The tube was opened under mercury,
 and the gas transferred to a eudiometer, in which it was rapidly
 absorbed by a fragment of potash. After absorbing the gas, no
trace of silica or iodine could be found in the liquid. The oxygen
displaced by the <U+FB02>uorine had combined with potash or water, to
form peroxide either of potassium or hydrogen. The tube was
not at all attacked. The author believes he has isolated <U+FB02>uo
rine, and he mentions Davy’s statement that <U+FB02>uorine does not
attack glass, and could be transferred over mercury. He pro
poses to repeat the experiment with bromine.
     Marignacr has communicated the abstract of a long series of
researches on the tungstates, <U+FB02>uotungstates, and silicotungstates.
He agrees with Scheibleri in considering that there are only two
varieties of tungstic acid--one insoluble, forming ordinary tung
states precipitable by acids, and the other soluble, forming soluble
mctatnngstates not precipitable by acids.
     The constitution of the metatungstates is simple, and agrees
with the formula MO 4!WO +.rAq. The neutral tungstates are

  represented by the formula MOWO3; but there are numerous
 acid salts with various and complex constitutions, although all
 containing 2% to 2% equivalents of acid for one of base. These
 are probably complex compounds of bitungstates and tritung
 states.
     Among these various salts, which are decomposed by frequent
 solutions and recrystallizations, there is one class distinguished
 by their great stability, and which Laurent called the paramag
 states. He believed the ratio of the base to acid was as 5 : 12.
 More recently Lotz was led to propose the ratio 3 :7, which
 view Scheibler adopted. Marignac’s analyses have led him to
 support 'Laurent’s views, or rather to consider them as double
 salts, and, allowing for the water in their composition, formulate
 them thus:
            3(MO, HO, 2WO3) + 2(MO, 2110, awoa).
     Marignac, like Berzelius, has not been able to obtain true
 <U+FB02>uotungstates: the salts obtained by treating tungstates with
 hydro<U+FB02>uoric acid contain oxygen, and may be considered as
 compounds of tungstates and <U+FB01>uotungstates, and represented by
 the general formula
                M VVO9 F’, or MO WO8 + MF XVF3.
    In the study of the crystalline form of the <U+FB01>uoxytungstates,
 one‘ curious result has been noted, namely, that the <U+FB02>uoxy
 tungstate of copper is isomorphous with the group containing
the <U+FB02>uosilicate, <U+FB02>uostannate, and <U+FB02>uotitanate of the same meta .
 With the ordinary formulae,
               Cu F Ti F2 and CuO WO8 + CuF W F’,
this isomorphism appears at <U+FB01>rst sight inexplicable. But this
anomaly disappears when it is considered that isomorphism only
obtains in formulae when these represent the atomic composition
of a body, and not their equivalent constitution. Now <U+FB02>uorine
being a biatomic element, it must be doubled, and thus the for
mulae of these compounds become
                     Cu Ti F6 and CuVVO2 F‘.
    This curious isomorphism justi<U+FB01>es to a certain point the con
clusions, that <U+FB02>uorine can in certain cases replace oxygen atom
for atom, spite of the non-equivalence of their atoms; and also
that Berzelius’s mode of regarding the <U+FB02>uoxytnngstates, or salts of
tungstates and <U+FB02>uotungstates, cannot be retained, for the isomor
phism of these salts with the <U+FB02>uotitanates cannot be thereby
explained.
   The silicotungstates are a new class of salts, but must have
been obtained by most chemists who have worked at the tung

  states, for they are contained in the mother-liquor from the pre
   paration of the latter. They are easily obtained by boiling the
   solutions of the acid tungstates with gelatinous silica. The
  potash-, soda-, and ammonia-salts are all as yet studied. They
  are soluble, and crystallize well. In many respects their solu
  tions comport themselves like those of the metatungstates. They
  are very stable, and are not decomposed by treatment with hy
   drochloric acid, and are only converted into acid salts. By fusion
   with alkalies they are converted into a mixture of tungstates and
  silicates. They all appear to contain ten equivalents of tungstic
  to one of silicic acid, and the neutral salts contain four equivalents
  of base. These ratios it is convenient to double, and represent
  the neutral silicotungstates by the general formula
                          8MO 20WO*’, 2SiO",

      M. Persoz, jun.*, has found that silk rapidly dissolves in a hot
  ‘concentrated solution of chloride of zinc, and more slowly in the
  cold. The solution used marked 60° in the areometer, and was
  boiled with oxide of zinc, so that it was basic; it became cloudy
  on the addition of water from the precipitation of a basic chlo
  ride. The solution thus prepared dissolves silk without attacking
  either wool or vegetable <U+FB01>bres. In any mixture of the three the
  silk may be dissolved by chloride, and the wool destroyed by
  soda, so as to preserve only the vegetable <U+FB01>bres. It thus affords
  a means of discriminating the complex nature of certain tissues.
     Chloride of zinc can dissolve such a quantity of silk as to be
  entirely viscous, and capable of being drawn out like a thick
  syrup, resembling a concentrated solution of gum-arabic. Am
  monia produces, in a solution of the silk diluted with water, a
  precipitate readily soluble in an excess of the reagent.
     Persoz submitted this solution, diluted with water acidulated
  by hydrochloric acid, to the action of the dialyser. The chloride
  of zinc passed in large quantity; the liquid became more viscous
  and then increased in volume, forming an opaline jelly like starch
_ paste. It still contained a small quantity of zinc, from which it

    some organic                 have investigated the action i of iodine
                    sulphur-compounds.
   When iodine is added to a solution of sodium-mercaptan, a
brisk action takes place, the colour of the iodine disappears, and
an oily layer separates on the surface which has all the properties
of bisulphide of ethyle. The reaction may be thus expressed :——

   The action of iodine on the thiacetates of sodium, potassium,
and barium was also investigated. The reaction is in all cases the
same; an iodide of the metal is formed and bisulphide of acetyle,

   The raw product from this reaction contains some free sulphur,
resulting from an action of water on the bisulphide. It is puri<U+FB01>ed
by washing with water, drying over CaCl, and <U+FB01>ltering. A pro
duct is thus obtained which, in winter, gradually solidi<U+FB01>es to a
crystalline mass. This substance still contains free sulphur; it
is accordingly exposed to a temperature of 15°, upon which it
partially crystallizes; the liquid is poured off from the crystals,
which are then melted and again allowed to crystallize, and the
process is repeated several times. Finally, the crystals are dissolved
in a small quantity of bisulphide of carbon, the solution cooled,
 and a crystal of bisulphide of acetyle added, on which large
 colourless transparent crystals gradually form.
    Pure bisulphide of acetyle melts at 20°; it has apeculiar, very
 slightly hepatic odour. It is insoluble in water, but readily so in
alcohol, ether, and bisulphide of carbon.         It is decomposed by
 water, with formation of thiacetic acid and separation of free
 sulphur. It is decomposed with violence by strong nitric acid.
 It is also decomposed by heat. When distilled, thiacetic acid
passes over at 93°, the temperature gradually rises to 160°; the

   Bisulphide of acetyle was treated with mercury in the antici
pation of removing sulphur and forming free acetyle ; a metallic
sulphide was formed, but an organic product free from sulphur
could not be obtained.
   The facility with which zincethyle is prepared by the method
described by Rieth and Bcilstein*, has led these chemists? to try
several reactions with it. In the expectation of forming an
allyle from an ethyle compound, they investigated the action of
chloride of carbon on_ zincethyle, which might take place in
the following manner :—
        GCl“+2Zn G’ H5=G3 H5 Cl+2Zn Cl+G’ H5 Cl.
This anticipation, however, was not realized; ethylene and pro
pylene gases were obtained.         The action is very energetic, and
only small quantities of the chloride must be added at once; by
carefully regulating the temperature, a continuous disengage
ment of gas is obtained. To free the gas from chloride of
ethyle, it is passed through sulphide of potassium and potash;
it is then absorbed by bromine. When the action is complete,
the bromine is treated by caustic potash and then washed with
water, upon which a mixture in equivalent quantities of bromide
of ethylene and bromide of propylene is obtained. In reference
to this, the authors were enabled to con<U+FB01>rm an observation which
had been already made by Bauer, namely, that it is impossible
to separate the two by fractional distillation. The boiling-point
rose at once to 135°, and between this temperature and 139°
the whole liquid passed over. The analysis of the product gave
numbers which are exactly intermediate between those required
by bromide of ethylene and bromide of propylene. The reac

the reaction consisted of amylene, the formation of which may

 The action is much less energetic than that of chloride of carbon,
 and requires to be aided by heat.         The amylene was absorbed
 by bromine, so as to convert it into bromide; and the authors
 con<U+FB01>rm the observations made by other chemists as to the diffi
culty of obtaining this body pure, inasmuch as it is mixed with
 other bromides, and is partially decomposed by distillation.
    Sesquicbloride of carbon, G2 C16, acts very energetically on
zincethyle, and is hereby reduced to the protochloride of car
 bon, G5‘ G1‘. This latter body appears to be without action on
 zincethyle.
    According to Fittig*, when one equivalent of benzole is heated
with 2 of bromine, a slight elevation of temperature ensues, and
a brown liquid is formed which continually gives out hydro
bromic acid. When the liquid is allowed to stand for about
eight days, then treated with potash, washed, and recti<U+FB01>ed along
with some unaltered benzole and a small quantity of crystalline
 dibromobenzole, monobromobenzole passes over amounting to
about three-fourths of the benzole taken, and with a constant
boiling-point between 152° and 154°.
    Monobromobenzole is a very indifferent body; it can be boiled
for days with caustic potash without alteration. It is also
without action upon cyanide of potassium or acetate of silver.
    It is, however, acted upon by sodium: when to an ethereal
solution of monobromobenzole sodium is added, a bluish-black
coating is rapidly formed upon it, which becomes heavy and sinks,
and at the same time the ether becomes heated to ebullition.
When the action is <U+FB01>nished, the mass is treated with ether so
long as anything is extracted, the ethereal solution <U+FB01>ltered,
and the ether distilled off, upon which a yellowish coloured
oil is left, which at a higher temperature passes over colour
less and solidi<U+FB01>es in the receiver. This body is the radical
phenyle, G" H‘°, or E:          , and it stands to the alcohol, G6 H6 9,
homologous with benzoic alcohol, in the same relation as ethyle,
(S9 H5              .
8; H5} , to ethylic alcohol.
   Phenyle crystallizes from its alcoholic solution in large colourless
transparent, brilliant laminae, which are endowed with a brilliant
lustre. It melts at 70°'5, and boils at about 245°.
    In a subsequent investigation 1', Fittig has examined some of
the derivatives of this body. \Vhen strong nitric acid is poured
over small quantities of phenyle, this body becomes transiently
black, and then dissolves in the acid with violent action. On

obtained ,- but if sulphuretted hydrogen has only been passed
into the cold liquid until it has dissolved up clear, the former
compound is obtained. They may be separated by using their
different solubility in water, as diamidophenyle only is soluble in
hot water; or it may be precipitated from the solution as sul
phate by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid.

resemblance with dinitrophenyle, from which the body also
differs by melting at 93°'5 ; that is, more than 100 degrees
lower. Yet this compound has the same composition as dinitro
phenyle, and the two bodies are therefore isomeric; Fittig
names it isodinitrophenyle.         The two bodies appear to be
always produced at the same time; but the conditions of their
formation have not been ascertained.        They are probably deri
vatives of two isomeric hydrocarbons, which by a transposition
of their atoms readily pass into one another.

      XXXI. Remarks on an Article entitled “Energy ” in ‘ Good
                 Words.’ By Jonn TYNDALL, F.R.S.*
THE time which I am able to devote to unscienti<U+FB01>c reading
         is so stinted as to leave me in almost utter ignorance of
the general periodical literature of this country. Hence it is that
until the 20th of February I was not aware of the existence of an
article in the October Number of a journal called ‘ Good Words,’
from the combined pens of the Professors of Natural Philosophy in
 Glasgow and in Edinburgh-—Professor William Thomson and
Professor Tait—-—in which, though not mentioned by name, I am
referred to in a manner which it might be expected would have
come to my knowledge long ago. When, however, it is known
that the other articles in the number to which I refer, hear such
titles as “The Childhood of Jesus,” “ The Trial Sermon,”
“ The Bands of Love,” “At Home in the Scriptures,” &c., I
think I may be excused if an article on Energy, in the scienti<U+FB01>c
 sense of the term, imbedded in such matter as those titles indi
cate, escaped my attention.
     The article referred to contains the following paragraph :—
     “ Curiously enough, although similar coincidences are com
mon, while Joule was pursuing and publishing his investigations,
there appeared in Germany a paper by Mayer, of Heilbronn.
Its title is ‘Bemerkungen iiber die Kriifte der unbelebten Natur,’
and its date 1842.        In this paper the results obtained by pre
vious naturalists are stated with precision (among them the
fundamental one of Davy), new experiments are suggested, and
a method for <U+FB01>nding the mechanical equivalent of heat is pro
pounded'|'. On the strength of this publication an attempt has
    * Communicated by the Author.
   '|' To this portion of _their paragraph Messrs. Thomson and Tait have
appended the following note, which I leave to the consideration of those
who are acquainted with Mayer’s publications. I purposely abstain from
making any scienti<U+FB01>c comment on either the article or the note; moral
considerations alone now interest me. “Mayer’s method,” writes the
northern philosophers, “is founded on the supposition that diminution of
the volume of a body implies an evolution or generation of heat ; and it
involves essentially a false analogy between the natural fall of a body to the
earth, and the condensation produced in an elastic <U+FB02>uid by the application
of external force. The hypothesis on which he thus grounds a de<U+FB01>nite
numerical estimate of the relation between the agencies here involved, is
that the heat evolved when an elastic <U+FB02>uid is compressed and kept cool, is
simply the dynamical equivalent of the work employed in compressing it.
The experimental investigations of subsequent naturalists have shown that
this hypothesis is altogether false for the generality of <U+FB02>uids, especially
liquids, and is at best only approximately true for air; whereas Mayer’s
statements imply its indiscriminate application to all bodies in nature,
whether gaseous, liquid, or solid, and show no reason for choosing air for
the application of the supposed principle to calculation, but that at the
time he wrote air was the only body for which the requisite numerical data
were known with any approximation to accuracy.”

          Prof. Tyndall on the Claims of Mayer and Joule.         221
been made to claim for Mayer the credit of being the <U+FB01>rst to
establish in all its generality the principle of the Conservation
of Energy. It is true that ‘la science n’a pas de patrie,’ and it
is highly creditable to British philosophers that they have so
liberally acted according to this maxim. But it is not to be
imagined that on this account there should be no scienti<U+FB01>c
patriotism, or that, in our desire to do all justice to a foreigner,
we should depreciate or suppress the claims of our own country
men. And it especially startles us, that the recent attempts to
place Mayer in a position which he never claimed, and which
had long before been taken by another, should have found
support within the very walls wherein Davy propounded his
transcendent discoveries.”
    This paragraph-—at all events the latter part of it—refers to a
Lecture on Force given by me at the Royal Institution on the
evening of Friday the 6th of June, 1862. An abstract of the
lecture is printed in the ‘Proceedings’ of the Institution; it is
reprinted in the Philosophical Magazine for last July, and it
also forms a portion of the Appendix to the 12th Lecture in my
book on Heat, which is announced by the Messrs. Longman for
the 4th of March.
    Many will agree with me in thinking that it would hardly
 conduce to the interests or the dignity of science, if the habit were
 to become general of taking di<U+FB02>icult and disputed points, which
 apparently involve imputations on individual character, into
 such a court as that chosen by Professor Thomson and Professor
 Tait. It is very laudable and very desirable that men in their
 high positions should instruct the readers of ‘Good Words ;’
 but these respectable persons are placed in a false position when
 they are virtually called upon to decide between the rival claims
 of Joule and Mayer, and to form an opinion as to the scienti<U+FB01>c
 morality of. myself. \rVith such an audience authority is, of
 course, decisive; and hence the practical wisdom of combining
 two pens in performing the normal work of one. There is,
 however, another court, in which mere authority is less influential,
 and in the decisions of which I shall always cheerfully acquiesce.
 To this court, that of instructed men of science, I now beg to
 transfer the case opened by the two gentlemen referred to in
 ‘ Good Words.’
     The precise meaning of the above paragraph, in all its parts,
 is dif<U+FB01>cult to de<U+FB01>ne; but its effect is to leave upon the reader’s
 mind a very unpleasant impression regarding the part which I
 have acted with reference to the claims of Dr. Mayer and Dr.
 Joule*. Possibly its distinguished authors did not mean to pro
  . * The journal in which this impression is conveyed enjoys a monthly
  circulation of 70,000.

222      Prof. Tyndall on the Claims of Mayer and Joule.
duce this impression. If not, they will perhaps have the kindness
to say so in the proper place. If they did, then I trust they will
not deem me unreasonable if I ask them to be more explicit. I
hereby openly invite them to point out the particulars in which
I have erred in judgment or misrepresented facts. I challenge
them to do so, not in the spirit of polemical bravado, but because
I know my own readiness to make prompt atonement for any
wrong that I may have done. I can scarcely allow myself to
suppose that the charge implied in the phrase “depreciate or
suppress the claims of our own countrymen,” is meant to apply
to me. But it is at least doubtfully employed, placed as it is in
such close proximity to a most pointed reference to myself. The
grammatical meaning of the sentence which follows seems to be
that “attempts (made by others) to place Mayer in a position
which he never claimed,” were “ supported” by me. As a
matter of fact, this is incorrect.
   The assertion of Messrs. Thomson and Tait, that Mayer had
never claimed the position which I assigned to him, is also
incorrect. It is true, indeed, that the “claims ” of Mayer have
been few and far between; and in this respect his example
might, in many cases, be followed with advantage. He recog
nizes the great merits of Mr. Joule; he says it cannot be denied
that he made the independent discovery of the convertibility
and equivalence of heat and motion. He dwells with pleasure
upon Joule’ beautiful researches, and states that the law of
equivalence, and its numerical expression, were published almost
simultaneously in Germany and in England. As far as I can
judge, he desires nothing more than permission to stand beside
his more fortunate fellow-labourer in the memory of men. But
he will not bear, nor do I think the scienti<U+FB01>c world will call upon
him to bear, removal from the position which he has so fairly
won. At page 53 of his last pamphlet, entitled Bemerkungen
iiber das mec/zanische Equivalent der Wfirme (Hielbronn, 1851),
he writes thus :-—“The new subject (the mechanical theory of
heat) soon began to excite the attention of learned men ; but inas
much as both at home and abroad the subject has been exclu
sively treated as a foreign discovery, I <U+FB01>nd myself compelled to
make the claims to which priority entitles me; for, although
the few investigations which I have given to the public, and
which have almost disappeared in the <U+FB02>ood of communications
which every day sends forth, without leaving a trace behind,
prove, by the very form of their publication, that I am not one
who hankers after effect, it is not therefore to be assumed that
I am willing to be deprived of intellectual property, which docu
mentary evidence proves to be mine.”
   In my morning lectures, which extended over three months of

        T Prof. Tyndall on the Claims of Mayer and Joule.                223
the spring of last year, the name and merits of Mr. Joule were
constantly before my audience ; and throughout the entire course
I made but a single passing allusion to Mayer.              In fact, I was
then as unacquainted with the real merits of Mayer as Professors
Thomson and Tait appear to be now*. But even after I had
made myself acquainted with all that Mayer had done,I did not
bate a jot in my admiration of Mr. Joule. For a whole month
before the above words regarding depreciation and suppression
received public utterance, the following passage, with reference
to the mechanical theory of heat, stood in the largest type of
the Philosophical Magazine :—“ It is to Mr. Joule, of Man
chester, that we are almost wholly indebted for the experimental
treatment of this subject. With his mind <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed upon a
principle, and undismayed by the coolness with which his <U+FB01>rst
labours appear to have been received, he persisted for years in
his attempts to prove the invariability of the relation between
heat and ordinary mechanical force. He placed water in a
suitable vessel, agitated it by paddles moved by measurable
forces, and determined the elevation of temperature; he did the
same with mercury and sperm-oil. He also caused discs of
cast iron to rotate against each other, and measured the heat
produced by their friction. He urged water through capillary
tubes, and measured the heat thus generated. The results of
his experiments leave no doubt upon the mind, that under all
circumstances the absolute amount of heat produced by the ex
penditure of a de<U+FB01>nite amount of mechanical force is <U+FB01>xed and
invariable.”
   In my ‘ Lectures on Heat, considered as 9. Mode of Motion,’
now on the point of publication, I have drawn the following
parallel between Joule and Mayer :—
   “Do I refer to these things in order to exalt Mayer at the
expense of Joule? It is far from my intention to do so. The
man who through long years, without encouragement, and in
the face of di<U+FB02>iculties which might well be deemed insurmount
able, could work with such unswerving steadfastness of purpose
to so triumphant an issue, is safe from depreciation. And it is
not the experiments alone, but the spirit which they incorporate,
and the applications which their author made of them, which
entitle Mr. Joule to a place in the foremost rank of physical
philosopher. Mayer’s labours have, in some measure, the
stamp of a profound intuition, which rose, however, to the
energy of undoubting conviction in the author’s mind. Joule’s
labours, on the contrary, are an experimental demonstration.
True to the speculative instinct of his country, Mayer drew
large and weighty conclusions from slender premises, while the
    "' I here, of course, refer to the time when they wrote their article.

224                       Royal Society :—
Englishman aimed, above all things, at the <U+FB01>rm establishment of
facts. And he did establish them. The future historian of
science will not, I think, place these men in antagonism.           To
each belongs a reputation which will not quickly fade, for the
share he has had, not only in establishing the dynamical theory
of heat, but also in leading the way towards a right appreciation
of the general energies of the universe.”
    If this recognition of Mr. Joule will not satisfy my clpitics, I
cannot hel it. It is simply a difference of estimate etwecn
them and iiie—a difference which may exist without the least
infraction of good faith on either side. There is nothing here
to “startle” brave men, or to give the slightest colouring of
truth to insinuations regarding “depreciation ” and “suppress
sion.” However “ the walls wherein Davy propounded his trans
cendent discoveries ” may feel the want of his great presence, I
trust they still contain men not less anxious than he was _to act
honourably by their fellows, and who would consider the highest
rewards of science too dear if purchased by any deviation from
this course of action.

        “On the Theory of the Motion of Glaciers.”         By William
 Hopkins, Esq., F.R.S.
    Almost all the numerous discussions which have taken place during
the last twenty years respecting our theories of glacial motion have
 had for their object the assertion of some particular view, rather
 than the establishment of a complete and su<U+FB01>icieut theory founded
on well-de<U+FB01>ned hypotheses and unequivocal de<U+FB01>nitions, together
with a. careful comparison of the results of accurate theoretical in
 vestigation with those of direct observation. Each of these views
 has been regarded, improperly, in the author’s opinion, as a Theory of
 Glacial Motion. The Expansion Theory ignored the Sliding Theory,
 though they were capable of being combined ; the latter theory was
 equally ignored by the Viscous Theory, in which, moreover, instead
 of the de<U+FB01>nitions of terms being clear and determinate, no de<U+FB01>nition
 of viscosity was ever given, though that term designated the funda
 mental property oii which the views advocated by this theory de
 pended. Again, the Regelation Theory is not properly a theory of
 the motion of glaciers, but a beautiful demonstration of a property

    Mr. W. Hopkins on the Theory of the Motion of Glaciers.            225
   of ice, entirely new to us, on which certain peculiarities of the mo
   tions of glaciers depend.
      When we shall have obtained a. Theory of the Motion of Glaciers
   which shall command the general assent of philosophers, no qualify
   ing epithet will be required for the word theory ; it would indeed be
   inappropriate, as seeming to indicate the continued recognition of
   some rival theory.     If, for instance, it should be hereafter admitted
   that the sliding of a glacier over its bed and the property of rege
   lation in ice are equally necessary, and, when combined, perfectly
   su<U+FB01>icient to account for the phenomena of glacial motion, there
   would be a manifest impropriety, not to say injustice, in selecting
   either of the terms sliding or regelation by which to designate this
   combined theory. The author makes these remarks because he
   believes that the preservation of the partial epithets above mentioned
   has a tendency to prevent our regarding the whole subject in that
   more general and collective aspect under which it is one of the prin
   cipal objects of this paper to present it.                              1
      This object must necessarily give to the present paper something
   of the character of a résumé of what has hitherto been done, whether
   it be our purpose to adopt or reject the conclusions of others. There
   are periods in the history of almost every science when its sound
   and healthy progress may almost as much demand the refutation of
. that which is erroneous as the establishment of that which is true.
   It is not intended, however, to enter into any review of the past
   labours of glacialists with respect to exploded theories, but only to
   notice those more recent researches and speculations which appear
  either to demand refutation as erroneous, or to be admitted into any
   well-founded theory as correct.
      With a view, in the <U+FB01>rst place, to remove the ambiguities which
  have beset this subject from the want of explicit de<U+FB01>nitions, the
  author enters into the following. discussion and explanation of terms
  employed to express properties of ice on which our theories of glacial
  motion must essentially depend.
      1. The external forms of all bodies in nature may be changed in a
  greater or less degree, and without producing discontinuity in their
  mass or destruction of their internal structure, by the action of any
  external forces, the original or undisturbed form from which the
  change of form is to be estimated being that which the body would
  assume if acted on by no external forces whatever. This change of
  form necessarily implies a change in the relative positions of the
  component particles of the mass, or a certain greater or smaller
  amount of molecular mobility, or power in the particles of moving
  inter see. We may speak either of the general change of the form
  of the whole body, or of that which takes place in each of its small
  elementary portions; it is, in fact, in this latter sense that we are
  obliged to regard it in any accurate investigations, because the change
  of form for di<U+FB02>'erent elements will usually be different. Change of
  form in an element may or may not be accompanied by a change of
  its volume. In the <U+FB01>rst case it leads to cubical extension or com
  pression; in the latter, merely to extension or compression of the
      Phil. May. S. 4. Vol. 25. No. 167. March 1863.                Q

Q26      '   l           i Royal Society :- '
surface and not the volume of the element. It may be called super
<U+FB01>cial extension or compression. These changes of volume and form
 in any element must be produced by the forces acting on it. Thus
 we may conceive linear extension alone produced at any interior point
 of the mass by two equal and opposite tensions acting on two eleg
 mentary component particles there in the direction of the line joining
 their centres of gravity, while compression alone would result if those
 tensions were changed into pressures. In such cases extension or
 compression would be the result of forces which may be called direct
 or normal forces. In the case above mentioned, in which the volume
 and density of every element of the mass remain unaltered, there
 can be no such direct normal action as that just mentioned.       It must
 be perpendicular to the normal action, and therefore a transversal or
 tangential action.‘ There would be no tendency to make the con
 tiguous particles approach to or recede from each other, but to cause
 the one to slide tangentially past the other.
    If the body have a structure like that of any hard, vitreous or
 crystalline mass, pressure at any point will tend to break or crush
 the body, and thus to destroy the continuity of its structure. This
 tendency will be opposed by the resisting power of the substance.
 The tendency of the direct or normal tension is to separate the con
 tiguous particles, and thus produce a <U+FB01>nite <U+FB01>ssure, or a discontinuity
 in the mass. It is resisted by the normal cohesive power; and in
 like manner the transverse or tangential action is resisted by the
 tangential cohesion, or that which prevents the component particles
 from sliding past each other.     Again, when the component particles
 at any point of a body are relatively displaced, they have always a
 certain tendency to regain their originally undisturbed position, and
 the force thus excited, considered with reference to the force of
 displacement at that point, affords a measure of what is called the
 elasticity of the body. Since the force of restitution may vary from
 zero to the corresponding force of displacement, the elasticity, when
 measured by their ratio, may vary from zero to unity.
    2. We may now de<U+FB01>ne such terms as solid, plastic, viscous, and
 the like, with all the accuracy which their de<U+FB01>nitions admit of.      We
may call a body emphatically a solid body when it posesses the
 following properties :—(l) small extensibility and compressibility,
 (2) great power of resistance and great cohesive power, both normal
 and tangential, and (3) great elasticity.    It will thus require a com
 paratively great force to produce any sensible relative displacement
among the constituent molecules of the body; if we conceive the
force required to become in<U+FB01>nitely great, we arrive at absolute rigidity
 as the limit of solidity. Again, we shall best, perhaps,- de<U+FB01>ne
plasticity or viscosity, if we suppose the forces of displacement to be
 such as to produce only a small transverse or tangential displacement
of the constituent particles, i. e. a super<U+FB01>cial, not a cubical, extension
 or compression. Then if the force of restitution bear only an inap
preciable ratio to the corresponding force of displacement, 1'. e. if the
 tangential elasticity be not of sensible magnitude, the mass may be
 emphatically said to be plastic. This is the essential condition of

  Mr. W. Hopkins on the Theory of the Motion of Glaciers.              227
  what may with strict propriety be termed plasticity ; it might also
  be added that, as bodies are constituted in nature, the force required
  to produce the original displacement in plastic bodies will be small
  as compared with that required in solid bodies. Viscosity and semi
  <U+FB02>uidity are terms which only express similar properties of bodies, but
  usually indicating that still smaller forces only are required to produce
  a given displacement in such ‘bodies than in plastic ones. The limit
  ing case is that of perfect <U+FB02>uidity, in which both the forces of original
  displacement and those of restitution are inde<U+FB01>nitely small. In these
  latter cases the tangential cohesion is necessarily small, and such also
  (as bodies are usually constituted) will be the normal cohesion. At
  the same time the power of resisting compression of volume may be
  very great, as in fact it is in nearly all masses not technically desig
  nated as elastic massea.      In other words, the normal elasticity, with
  reference to pressure, may be of any magnitude, while the tangential
  elasticity equals zero.
      It will be observed that a body is here spoken of as held in a state
  of constraint by internal forces, but without any kind of dislocation
  which should destroy its continuity or injure its structure. If, how
  ever, the external forces should be sufficiently increased, the structure
  of a vitreous or crystalline mass, or that of any mass posessing hard
  ness and brittleness, will be destroyed by a pressure greater than its
  power of resistance can withstand; or the continuity of its mass will
   be destroyed by any normal tension greater than the normal cohesion;
   or, again, by any tangential tension greater than the tangential cohe
   sion.    The normal tension would thus produce an open <U+FB01>ssure; and
   the tangential tension would cause one particle of the mass to slide
   past another, but without producing any open discontinuity. On the
   contrary, in a properly plastic or viscous mass there is no de<U+FB01>nite
  ‘structure for excessive pressure to destroy ; there is no question as
   to the formation of open <U+FB01>ssures ; and the characteristic absence of
    tangential ~elasticity allows of any amount of change in the relative
   .positions of the constituent particles of the mass without breach of
   its continuity._
       It would of course be impossible to draw an exact and determinate
   line of demarcation between solidity and plasticity, but it is not there
_ fore the less certain that there are bodies which do unequivocally
   possess the property of solidity, and others which do as unequivocally
   possess the property of plasticity, according to the de<U+FB01>nitions here
   given of these terms. Solidity and plasticity with respect to nume
   rous cases in nature thus become determinate properties of those
   aggregates of material particles which we call bodies. Ice, a vitreous
   or crystalline and brittle mass, which will neither bear any but the
   smallest extension without breaking, nor more than the smallest com
   pression without being crushed, must be solid, and cannot be plastic,
   if we are to use those terms as signi<U+FB01>cant of determinate properties
   ‘of bodies.
       3. The advocates of the viscous theory would not probably admit
   the necessity of the above rigorous de<U+FB01>nition of the term viscous in
   its application to glacier ice. But the defect of that theory. has
                                       Q2

228                        Royal Society :'—-
always been in the entire want of any accurate de<U+FB01>nition of that term.
When such de<U+FB01>nition was demanded, it was said that glacier ice must
be viscous, because a glacier adapted itself to the inequalities of its
valley as a viscous mass would do. This was equivalent to saying
that the mass was viscous because it moved in a particular manner,
instead of asserting that the mass moved in that particular manner
because it was viscous. Now this kind of inversion of the direct
enunciation of the proposition is only admissible when there is no
other physical cause than the one assigned, to which it is conceivable
that the observed phenomena should be ascribed. Thus we may
assert with perfect conviction, that gravity exists as a property of
matter and acts according to a certain law, because the bodies of the
solar system move as if such were the case ; but the conclusiveness
of this inductive proof of the proposition--that “ gravity is a property
of matter ”—rests entirely on our conviction that matter has no other
property by which we could equally account for the phenomena of
the celestial motions.    And so with regard to glaciers.    If viscosity
were the only conceivable property of ice by which we could possibly
account for the observed motion of glaciers, then would the observed
phenomena of that motion perfectly convince us of the existence of
the property in question.       But here the two cases entirely differ,
inasmuch as there was no general conviction, nor even a decided pro
bability at the time I allude to, that no physical property of ice could
exist besides viscosity which might account for the observed pheno
mena of a glacier’s motion; and at the present time it is proved that
there is another property of ice by which those phenomena are per
fectly accounted for, and the inductive proof becomes altogether
valueless. Moreover, in the case of universal gravitation, the induc
tive proof is the only possible one, whereas in glacier motion we are
concerned with a property which, in whatever sense the de<U+FB01>nition of
it may be regarded, must be as capable of being rendered patent by
experiment in ice, if it exist, as in any other substance.
   The answer, then, that was given to the question—what is visco
sity ?—-comprised no de<U+FB01>nition at all of that term. The viscous
theory ignored the possibility of the molecular mobility of a glacial
mass united with the preservation of its continuity, being attributable
to any other property than that which was designated as viscosity,
but without giving any exact de<U+FB01>nition of the term. If it was meant
to de<U+FB01>ne by it the property which is here de<U+FB01>ned by the same terms,
the theory had a legitimate claim to be considered a physical theory,
because it assigned a determinate physical property as the cause of
certain observed phenomena.         In this sense, however, the author
conceives that it would now be admitted to be entirely disproved by
Professor Tyndall’s experiments, in which the ice exhibits so clearly
the property of solidity, and the absence of all indication of plasticity.
It may be presumed that the hypothesis of viscosity could only
have been adopted in the <U+FB01>rst instance from the apparent absence of
any other property of ice which might account equally well for the
molecular mobility of the glacial mass.
   4. But if the determinate property of viscosity, as here de<U+FB01>ned, be

   Mr. W. Hopkins on the Theory of the Motioniof Glaciers.              229
  not recognized in ice, what, it will be asked, is really the idea which
  has been attached to the term plastic or viscous’! The question, as
  already observed, is dif<U+FB01>cult to answer. Perhaps the best way of doing
  so is to refer to the Prefatory Note to Principal Forbes’s ‘ Occasional
  Papers ’ (p. xvi). He there intimates that the expressions “ bruising
  and re-attachment,” and “incipient <U+FB01>ssures re-united by time and
  cohesion,” used by him in 1846, are to be regarded as having the
  same meaning as the expression “ fracture and regelation,” <U+FB01>rst in
  troduced into the subject in 1857. Now there is no ambiguity what
  ever in this latter expression. “ Fracture ” means the breaking and
  splitting of the ice regarded as a brittle and crystalline solid, and
  could never be intended to have the slightest reference to viscosity.
  In fact the expression is altogether inapplicable to any body which can
  be called viscous without a violation of scienti<U+FB01>c language. Still this, it
 may be said, may be only a want of strict accuracy of expression, rather
 than of accuracy of conception. But if a notion of cracking and break
 ing, so foreign to any idea of plasticity, should be admitted, it could not
 be said that a glacier moved as it is observed to move, because it was
 plastic, but merely that it moved as if it were plastic. The true
 inference from the motion would have been that glacier ice possessed
 not necessarily real plasticity, a de<U+FB01>nite property of bodies, but a
 quasi-plasticity, which expresses no determinate property at all, but
 may consist with many different properties. It merely expresses, in
 fact, the power of the component elements of the mass of changing to
 a certain extent their relative positions. But this is not the peculiar
 property of ice ; it is common, indeed, to all bodies exposed to dis
 ruptive forces which, as in the case of ice, the cohesive power is un
 able to withstand. The mass of any other substance, as well as that
 of a glacier, will then be broken into fragments su<U+FB01>iciently small to
 allow it to follow the impulses of the external forces acting on it. To
 say, therefore, that a glacier moves as if it were plastic is not to as
 sign to ice any property peculiar to itself, and therefore does not pro
 perly constitute a physical theory of glacier motion at all.
    5. But if we pass over the difference between true plasticity and
that which, as we have pointed out, is merely apparent, there still
remained the great difficulty, which was only removed by the experi
ments of Mr. Faraday and Dr. Tyndall. Every one who believed ice
to be a solid body, believed as a matter of necessity that a glacier
must, on account of the external conditions to which it is subjected,
be excessively broken and dislocated in the course of its motion. The
author was himself one of those who fell into the error of attributing
too much in<U+FB02>uence to the larger and more visible disruptions of the
mass ; but the great di<U+FB01>iculty was in the perfect subsequent reunion
of portions which had thus been separated, whether by larger or
smaller dislocations. And here it will necessarily be asked whether,
in the expressions above quoted, “ re-attachment ” and the “reunion
by time and cohesion” of separated portions when again brought
into contact, really mean the same thing as regelation? This question
the author thinks can be answered only by saying that, whatever
might be the intended meaning of those expressions, they failed to

  230                       Royal Society :
  convey to the minds of others the most remote idea of regelation, as
  a property of ice at a particular temperature. N0 better proof can
 be given of this than the general ‘conviction which appeared to <U+FB02>ash
  across the mind of every glacialist when he <U+FB01>rst heard of Professor
  Tyndall’s experiment, that the recognition of the property of instan
 taneous regelation was a well-marked and important discovery, which
 had at once completely removed a great stumbling-block in glacial
 theory. In fact, the viscous theory assigns no physical cause for
 the reunion in question. All we could do, before the publication of
 those experiments, was to infer from the observed facts that ice did
 possess some property which facilitated the reunion of separate pieces
 in contact; but this was like the attempt to de<U+FB01>ne viscosity by an
 appeal to the phenomena which that property was intended to ex
 plain. Regelation has, in fact, no connexion with viscosity, but stands
 in direct antagonism to it.
    An imperfect plasticity in ice has sometimes been spoken of. The
 fact is, all solid bodies may be said to have an imperfect plasticity, if
 we chose to admit this vagueness in scienti<U+FB01>c language, since all are
 capable of greater or less extension or compression. As to the apparent
 plasticity inferred from the motion of glacial masses, and arising from
 the crevicing of the ice as already explained, it has no relation what
 ever to real plasticity. Such crevices are the necessary consequences
 of the external forces acting on the glacier, and are as essential to the
 theory of regelation as they are unconnected with any property of
plasticity.
    The author then brie<U+FB02>y describes the experiment, by which it is
 shown that ice will slide down an inclined plane at an inclination to
 the horizon less than that of any known glacier, provided its lower
 surface be in that ‘state of disintegration in which it will necessarily_
 be when its temperature = zero (C.). The motion is then slow and
 uniform.     That glaciers do slide over their beds, has been established
 as clearly as it can be by the comparatively few observations which
 have been made on the subject; and every existing glacial valley,
 and every valley which is believed to have been such at former
 geological periods, testify to the truth of that conclusion. The
 author also explains that both theory and observation agree in the
 result that the temperature of the lower surface of a glacier of any
 considerable depth in the latitude of the Alps must necessarily be
 =zer0            He regards this sliding motion as far too important a
 part of the whole motion of a glacier to be neglected in any com
plete theory of that motion.
    The author then proceeds to investigate certain properties of the
internal tensions and pressures at any point (P) in the interior of a
mass held in a state of constraint by external forces. He shows
that at every point (P) there are three determinate directions, at
right angles to each other, in which the direct tension is such that
in one of them it is a maximum, in another a minimum, and in the
third neither a complete maximum nor a complete minimum; it is
convenient to call this the mean axis. The tensions or pressures in
these directions are called principal tensions orpreaaures ; there are

  Mr. W. Hopkins on the Theory of the Motion of Glaciers. 23L
also two other directions through P characterized by a peculiar pro
perty. If we take two adjoining particles, P and P’, in the line of
maximum tension, that tension will exert a greater effort than there
will be in any other direction to separate those particles; or if the
internal force be the maximum pressure, those points will be more
compressed together than in any other direction. In the two direc
tions (now to be de<U+FB01>ned) the forces on P and P’, acting perpendicu
larly to the line joining those particles, will exert a greater tendency
than is exerted in any other direction, to separate them by making
one slide tangentially past the other, and then to twist and contort
any internal elementary portion of the mass. These two directions
are perpendicular to each other, and bisect the angles between the
directions of maximum tension and maximum pressure. This problem
is treated entirely mathematically; it is the typical problem of this
part of the subject. The results are applied to a real glacier by the
analogy which it bears to the typical one.
   For the application of these analytical results, the author then
considers the nature of the forces called into action by the two pri
mary characteristics of the motion of a glacier—that its central move
faster than its marginal portions, and the portions near the upper
faster than those near the lower surface of the mass. He also takes
account ofthe modi<U+FB01>cations to which these forces may be subjected
by changes of form and inclination in the containing valley. He
likewise explains the different modes in which the mass may be
fractured when the forces become such as to overpower its powers of
cohesion or resistance. If the cohesion give way to the maximum
tension, an open <U+FB01>ssure must be formed in a direction perpen
dicular to that tension. If the res-istiny power of the ice give way to
the maximum pressure at any point, the mass will be crushed at that
point, but its continuity will be immediately restored by regelation,
the internal constraint will be momentarily removed, and the mass
will move on.    By a repetition of this process the glacier is enabled
to move forward, preserving at once the continuity of its motion, of
its mass, and of its structure.
   The veined structure of glacial ice is then examined, and it is shown
that, so far as Professor Tyndall’s pressure theory of that structure
involves the condition of the structural surfaces being perpendicular
at each point to the maximum pressure there, it is perfectly accordant
with the theoretical results of this paper. Whether the structure be
marginal, longitudinal and central, or transversal, this is equally true,
assuming always that the structure in each locality is the direct and
immediate consequence of the forces acting there and tending to pro
duce it.    Probably, however, the veined structure in one locality
may have originated in another from which it has been transmitted
by the motion of the glacier.    Supposing this to be so entirely, the
author examines how this motion of transmission would modify the
forms of the transmitted structure. Practically, and within the
limits to which observation has yet extended, these ‘modi<U+FB01>cations
would produce forms sensibly coincident with those which would
result, as in the previous case considered, from the immediate action

 232                         Royal Society.
 of the forces, independently of transmission.     The respective e<U+FB01>'ec
 tiveness of these two causes, therefore, in producing the veined
 structure in any particular locality is not at present determined. Its
 determination would require more accurate and detailed observations
 than have yet been made on this subject.
     The dfferential theory of the veined structure is then considered;
 but here the author dissents entirely from all Professor Forbes’s
 mechanical reasoning, by which he professes to determine the
 positions of the surfaces of maximum differential motion, which,
 according to this theory, are coincident with the structural veins.
 Mr. Hopkins contends that the actual differential motion of two con
 tiguous particles must necessarily take place in the common direction
 of their motions. He cannot understand the effectiveness of such
 motion in any other sense, in producing the phenomena in question.
 He has investigated for this case the forms of the veined surfaces,
 but <U+FB01>nds them altogether different from the observed forms; and
 with respect to Prof. Forbes’s investigation he cannot possibly admit
 it, as he at present understands it.
    The author then examines the intensity of the dislocating forces
 acting on the glacier.     He demonstrates Prof. Forbes’s error in
 supposing that it is much augmented by an enormous hydrostatic
 pressure within the mass, tending to push it onward in the direction
 in which it may be most free to move. It is proved that, under the
 existing conditions of a glacier, the hydrostatic pressure from the
 water contained in the pores of the mass can but little exceed the
 atmospheric pressure on its surface.     But Mr. Hopkins shows that
 there must in many localities be a very large increase in the intensity
 of the internal tensions and pressures arising from the free sliding
 motion of the whole glacier. Where the motion of a particular part
 of the mass is retarded by local circumstances, there will probably be
 an enormous pressure upon it I) tergo, from the mass behind ; or
 there may, in other cases, be a great additional tension, arising from
 the freer motion of the mass in front. Hence the dislocating forces
 must often be greatly increased, the dislocation is ensured, and the
 operation of regelation brought into action ; and the continued motion
 of the glaciers is preserved when it might otherwise be arrested.

the Laurentian.” By J. J. Bigsby, M.D., F.G.S.                       .
   This paper is divided into two parts, the <U+FB01>rst treating of the
Cambrian Formation, and the second of the Huronian. The author
observed that the Cambrian is very local in its distribution, the Si
lurian in many cases lying directly upon Metamorphic Rocks; he
made some remarks upon the mineralogical and stratigraphical cha
racters of the <U+FB01>rst-named formation, the scarcity of its fossils, its
 conformable upward passage into the Silurian, and its absence in
America and Northern Europe.
    In the second part were described the Huronian of Canada, the
Azoic Rocks of the southern shores of Lake Huron and Lake Supe
rior, and the Second Azoic Group of Norway, all of which are con
 sidered by the author to belong to the same period. It was then
 stated that the Huronian Formation and its equivalents agree in
 being unconformable to the Silurian and conformable to the Lauren
tian, in containing many beds of Limestone and a large quantity
 of copper-ores, and in the total absence of fossils; in all of which
 respects they differ from the Cambrian. The author, therefore,
 came to the conclusion that the Cambrian and the Huronian are
 distinct formations, and that the latter is very much the older.

 Labyrinthodonts." By Professor T. H. Huxley, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Anthracosaurus is distinguished from all other known Labyrintho
 donts by the quadrate form and oblique position of the orbits, by the
 existence of elongated supratemporal foramina, and by the compara
 tively small number and large size of the teeth. The skull exhi
 bited had an extreme length of 15 inches, and an extreme width of
 12 inches. There are about thirty maxillary, two vomerine, and ten
 palatine teeth, which are ridged and become <U+FB02>attened and two
 edged towards their apices. The vomerine, palatine, and some of the
 anterior maxillary teeth are between 2 and 3 inches long, and from
 % to {L of an inch in diameter at the base. The species exhibited
 was named A. Russelli, after its discoverer. Probably its entire

   1. “ On the Skiddaw Slate Series." By Professor R. Harkness,
F.R..S., F.G.S.; with a Note on the Graptolites, by J. W. Salter,
Esq., F.G.S.
   In this paper some general sections through the Skiddaw Slates
were described in detail, and the localities in which fossils had been
previously found by Professor Sedgwick were especially noticed.
The author then stated that he had discovered several species of
Graptolites new to the Skiddaw Slates in certain <U+FB02>aggy beds almost
devoid of cleavage, which occur at intervals in the lower portion of
the series, in several localities.  Professor Harkness showed that
these rocks were much more fossiliferous than had hitherto been
 supposed, and that the evidence of the fossils, as interpreted by
Mr. Salter, clearly proved them to be of the same age as the Lower
Llandeilo rocks of Wales and the Quebec Group of Canada. The
thickness of the Skiddaw Slates was estimated at 7000 feet, and the
total thickness from the base of the Skiddaw Slates to the Coniston
limestone at 14,000 feet.
    Besides several species of well-known Graptolites that are also
found in the Lower Llandeilo rocks and in the Quebec Group
 (Taconic System), Mr. Salter has been enabled to identify Plzyl/o
grapsus angustifolium, Hall, Tetragrapsus bryonoides, Hall, and an
 other species of that genus, Dichograpsus Sedgwicki, n. sp., Didymo
grapsus caduceus, and some others. He has given the name of Caryn
 caris Wrightii to a Crustacean discovered in these rocks by Mr.
 Wright. Mr. Salter considers the Skiddaw Slates to be of the same
 age as the Quebec Group, the graptolitiferous rocks of Melbourne,
 and the Tremadoc Slates of Wales.
    2. “ On Fossil Estheria, and their Distribution.” By Professor
T. Rupert Jones, F.G.S.
    Referring to the Monograph of Fossil Esiherize, now in course of
publication by the Palaeontographical Society, for descriptions of the
 species and for general remarks on the genus, the author in this
paper pointed out the chief characters of the fourteen species of
 Estheria: that he had obtained, by the help of friends at home and
 abroad, from several of the geological formations ; and pointed out
 that they belong mainly to the passage-groups, and, he believed,
 chie<U+FB02>y to fresh and brackish waters. He also compared the distri

 Estherie.

     1. “ On the Lower Carboniferous Brachiopoda of Nova. Scotia."
  By T. Davidson, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
     The age of these beds was stated to have been <U+FB01>rst clearly deter
  mined by Sir C. Lyell; and the author, having mentioned his con
  currence in the views of that geologist on this question, proceeded
  to point out the a<U+FB01>inities of the entire Carboniferous formation
  to the Permian, and observed that many species, especially of Bra
  chiopoda, are common to both formations. He combated the idea of
  a universal extinction of species at the close of the Palaeozoic epoch,
 on the ground that some Palaeozoic species pass upwards into Meso
 zoic strata; and then, after remarking upon the vagueness of the
 term ‘species,’ proceeded to show that science was not yet in a
 condition to enable us to test satisfactorily, by observation, the value
 of Mr. Darwin's theory of descent with modi<U+FB01>cation.       Mr. Davidson
 then remarked that the Lower Carboniferous Brachiopoda of Nova
 Scotia were smaller than the same or representative species occurring
 in contemporaneous strata in other parts of the world; and he con
 cluded by giving diagnoses of the species determined by him, and
 comparing his list of species with that given by Sir C. Lyell in his
 ‘ Travels in North America.’
    2. “On the Gravels and other super<U+FB01>cial Deposits of Ludlow,
 Hereford, and Skipton.” By '1‘. Curley, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
    In describing some plans and sections taken during the progress
 of drainage-works in Ludlow, Hereford, and Skipton, the author
pointed out the relations of the older rocks to the contiguous gravel
 deposits; he mentioned the existence, near Ludlow, of two kinds of
 gravel, having a difference of level of about 100 feet, described three
terraces of alike nature, about 30 or 40 feet apart vertically, in the
vicinity of Hereford, and then noticed the similar deposits near
 Skipton. Mr. Curley considers the majority of these gravel-beds to
be of lacustrine origin.

Randall, Esq. Communicated by the President.
    Sections obtained by the authors along the course of Linley
Brook, near Bridgenorth, Salop, were shown to exhibit an ascending
series of deposits from Aymestry shales, through Upper Ludlow
rock, Downton sandstones (with bone-bed), grey shales and grits
(with bone-bed), and plant-bearing shales, to Old Red clays. The
lower bone-bed was stated to be chie<U+FB02>y composed of scales of
Thelodus and broken Lingulaz, and the higher one to contain a more
than usual abundance of <U+FB01>sh-spines; and it was remarked that
crustacean remains were altogether absent, but Lingula cornea had
a range upwards to the Old Red clay. The authors considered the
physical conditions of the period to be those indicated by the

        Prof. Jamieson on the Parallel .Roads of Glen Ray.        237
remarks of Sir Roderick Murchison upon the change in the character

sandstone layer, lying between two bands of cornstone at Bouldon,
7 miles N. of Ludlow, were exhibited by the author, and doubtfully
referred to Hymenocaris.   The sandstone in question was stated to
be rich in crustacean and annelidan tracks and trails. The lower
cornstone in the section exhibited at Bouldon was referred to the
horizon of the plant-bearing shales of Linley.                  ‘
   3. “ On the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, and their place in the
History of the Glacial Period.”   By T. F. Jamieson, Esq., F.G.S.,
Professor of Agriculture in the University of Aberdeen.
   After describing the general appearance of the Roads, the author
referred to the different theories that have been framed to account
for them, giving his reasons for considering both the marine hypo
theses untenable, and pointing out the evidences in favour of
Agassiz's theory of a dam of glacier-ice having supported a fresh
water lake. He especially dwelt upon the coincidence between the
height of each of the Parallel Roads and that of a. neighbouring
watershed, but also remarked upon the objections to a glacial
barrier, explaining how it might have shrunk at three successive
periods, so as to allow of the formation of the three Roads. He
then showed that the period of the formation of these roads must
either have been posterior to that of the chief submergence of the
Drift-period, or that the sea did not reach them during the sub
mergence; also, that it was prior to the formation of the 40 feet
raised beach of Argyleshire.
   Professor Jamieson concluded by stating that his examination of
Lochaber had led him to infer that the Parallel Roads are the
beaches of ancient freshwater lakes, which arose from glaciers
damming the mouths of the valleys and reversing their drainage, at
a date subsequent to that of the great land-glaciation of Scotland,
owing to a re-extension of the glaciers after the chief submergence
of the Drift-period.

   The following communications were read 2-
   1. “ On a. Hyaena-den at Wookey Hole, near Wells.”-—No. II.
By W. Boyd Dawkins, Esq., B.A., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey
of Great Britain.
   The former but partial exploration of this cave by the author
convinced him of the desirability of a. more rigorous examination,
the details of which were given in this paper, with a Table of the
species of Mammalia whose remains were met with (showing the
distribution of the teeth and bones in the several parts of the cave),

238             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
and also a statement of the general results arrived at. A considera
tion of the distribution of the remains in the cavern and their close
juxtaposition to the roof, coupled with the fact that the <U+FB02>int and
chert implements discovered were found in much lower positions,
led Mr. Dawkins to infer that the bones had been dragged in by
hyaenas, and that the cave had been subjected to periodical inunda
tions of waters laden with red mud, whereby the bones had been
elevated by degrees until they occupied their present position.
After a detailed description of the bones, the author concluded by
some general remarks upon the bearing of this cave-fauna upon the
ancient physical geography of the district, and the antiquity of the
associated implements of human manufacture.
   2. “On the discovery of Paradozides in Britain." By J. W.
Salter, Esq., F.G.S., of the Geological Survey of Great Britain.
   A -short sojourn in the neighbourhood of St. David's enabled
Mr. Salter to discover, at Porth-rhaw, near Whitchurch, on the St.
David's road, a gigantic Trilobite belonging to a genus which has
been long sought for in the British Isles. The author gave a short
description of the geological features of the locality, and a section
showing the succession of beds belonging to the Primordial Zone in
Wales, as well as a diagnosis of the newly discovered Trilobite,
which he named Paradozides Davidi.

A. Leith Adams, A.M., M.B. (‘22nd Regiment).
   The Echinoderms described in this paper by Dr. Wright were
discovered by Dr. Leith Adams during a careful examination of the
strata and geological features of Malta. A description of the Mio
cene beds was given by the latter gentleman, in which he stated his
reasons for not accepting entirely the classi<U+FB01>cation of them proposed
by Captain Spratt, and followed by Earl Ducie in his Geological Map
of the Maltese Islands. He divided the Miocene strata into the
following subdivisions :—l. The Upper Limestone; 2. The Sand
Bed; 3. The Marl; 4. The Calcareous Sandstone; 5. The Lower
Limestone; and again subdivided the Upper Limestone into three
parts. Dr. Wright gave a diagnosis and detailed description of forty
species of Ecluinidze, eighteen of which are new; and Dr. Adams
added a Table showing their stratigraphical distribution.

     DETERMINATION or THE WAVE-LENGTH OF THE BAY A.
                          BY M. MASCAR/13
I HAVE the honour to lay before the Academy the results of some
     experiments which I have made on the application of coloured
<U+FB02>ames to the investigation of the lengthsof undulations. Bycomparing
the wavelengths of the rays corresponding to the di<U+FB02>"erent lines of the
solar spectrum with the deviations which the same rays undergo in
a refracting prism, it is seen that these two quantities vary in oppo
site directions, and that the ratio of the increase of the wave-length

                Intelliyence and Miscellaneous Articles.             Q39
to the corresponding diminution of deviation increases rapidly in the‘
less refrangible part of the spectrum. But the ray A of the extreme
red is difficult to work with, on account of the feeble lustre of the
solar light in this part of the spectrum ; its wave-length is not known,‘
and it is not mentioned in most of the tables of refraction hitherto
published.
 ~ It appeared to me interesting to determine this wave-length by the
aid of a grating; and I used for this purpose, not the solar light, but
the least de<U+FB02>ected bright ray of potash-salts, which, as the recent
experiments of M. Kirchhoff have shown, coincides exactly with the
ray A.
   I used a Babinet’s goniometer showing 10 seconds, and a grating
of about 4 square centimetres. super<U+FB01>cies divided into fortieths of a
millimetre ; I compared the deviation of the line A with that of the
bright soda line. To obtain the greatest intensity possible in the
luminous source, I used several methods, especially the combustion
of hydrogen charged with the vapours of potassium (as M M.Wolf and
Diacon have done on the suggestion of M. Foucault), and the volati
lization of chloride of potassium in an oxyhydrogen blowpipe. The
latter method, devised by M. Debray, always succeeded best. Spite
of these precautions I could only observe the <U+FB01>rst spectrum, which
gave little value to isolated observations; but the mean of a great
number of concordant measures was about 768 millionths of a
millimetre.
   For the wave-length of the line A the number 750 millionths of a
millimetre is generally received--a number deduced from the theore
tical law of dispersion found by M. Cauchy, or from an interpola
tion formula. When the season is more favourable to this kind of
experiments, I propose to determine the refractive indices of the ray
A in different substances, and to see if Cauchy's law agrees su<U+FB02>i-'
ciently with experiment.
    This research has led me to another observation. As I needed a
very intense luminous source, I thought of the volatilization of potas
sium between the two poles of a powerful voltaic battery; but the
result did not correspond to my anticipation. I obtained a magni<U+FB01>
cent spectrum, more complicated than those which have been hitherto
indicated for potassium; the red line corresponding to the solar
line B was very intense and quite double: but I sought in vain for
the line A ; and examining with care, I saw a feeble red illumination
 on both sides of an obscure space in the region of the luminous line;
 I could even distinguish a brilliant line between two black lines;
that is to say, the extreme double line of potassium was inverted.
 This partial reversal of the potash lines does not seem to me to be
in disaccord with M. Kirchhoff’s theory; for it is to be noted that
the line which is reversed is that which is produced at a lower tem
perature. The same phenomenon takes place with sodium as in
 M. Fizeau’s experiment; the double line D is the only one which is
 reversed; but this reversal has a peculiarity which every one has been
 able to observe : it is that the reversed black line can in certain cir~'
 cumstances increase to a considerable extent, retaining always well
 defined limits. The preceding method is advantageous for deten

mining the wave-length of certain very brilliant lines like those of
 lime, strontia, and thallium. It has given me the opportunity of
observing that at a high temperature thallium is not monochromatic
as had been thought. This fact is not surprising when we consider
the great number of lines which soda gives at a high temperature.
    These results are part of a research which I have been pursuing
for more than a year in the laboratories of the Ecole Normale. I
have already published, in the Revue des Sociétés Savants, a Note on
the chemical spectra of the alkaline metals, in order to reserve to
myself the facility of continuing these researches at pleasure.—
Comptes Rendus, January 19, 1863.
  ON A NEW FORM or SPECTROSCOPE. BY DR. WOLCOTT GIBBS.
   Messrs. J. andW. Grunow, the well-known opticians of New York,
have just completed, at my suggestion, a spectroscope involving a new
principle, or rather one for the <U+FB01>rst time applied to instruments of
this kind. In this instrument the prism of <U+FB02>int glass has a refract
ing angle of only 37°; the rays which diverge from the slit are ren
dered parallel in the usual manner, by an achromatic lens having the
slit in its principal focus. The bundle of rays then falls upon the <U+FB01>rst
surface of the prism at a perpendicular incidence, and of course makes
an angle of 37° with the second surface. Under these circumstances
the refraction takes place at an angle so near the limiting angle that
the refracted rays emerge nearly parallel to the second surface of the
prism. The amount of dispersion produced in this manner is very
great, while the loss of light, occasioned by re<U+FB02>exion at the <U+FB01>rst sur
face in the prisms of 60° placed in the position of least deviation, is
avoided. The spectrum thus produced possesses remarkable inten
sity, and the dark lines are seen in countless numbers and with great
distinctness. The instrument in this form is sufficient for all chemical
purposes; but it is so constructed as to permit the use of a second
prism, by which the length of the spectrum is of course greatly
increased. Though the telescopes are only 6 inches in length, with
a magnifying power of about 6, the spectrum compares very advan
tageously with that of a large apparatus with telescopes of 18 inches
focal length and 1%; inch aperture, and a prism of 60°. I may mention
that the centre of the second surface of the prism lies in the vertical
axis of the instrument, and also that in a prism of this kind the
refracted rays diverge as if from a single radiant point (which is not
the case with prisms of the ordinary construction), the angular disper
sion being at the same time much greater. So far as I have been able
to <U+FB01>nd, this form of prism was <U+FB01>rst employed by Matthiessen. In a
lithographed copy of Reg-nault’s ‘ Lectures on Optics ’ at the Collége
de France in 1848, prisms on this principle, of various forms, are
<U+FB01>gured and described, together with the spectra produced.' These
last exhibit an extraordinary extension of the violet end of the spec
trum. A Matthiessen prism of <U+FB02>int glass, in which the <U+FB01>rst surface
is concave so as to admit the addition of a double convex lens of
crown glass, appears to be preferable for the spectroscope, in conse
quence of the saving of light.-—Silliman’s American Journal, Janu
ary 1863.

      XXXIV. On Celestial Dynamics.            By Dr. J. R. M4Yna*.
                              I. Introduction.
  EVERY incandescent and luminous body diminishes in tem
         perature and luminosity in the same degree as it radiates
 light and heat, and at last, provided its loss be not repaired from
 some other source of these agencies, becomes cold and non
 luminous.
     For light, like sound, consists of vibrations which are com
 municated by the luminous or sounding body to a surrounding
 medium. It is perfectly clear that a body can only excite such
 vibrations in another substance when its own particles undergo
 a similar movement ; for there is no cause for undulatory motion
 when a body is in a state of rest, or in a state of equilibrium
 with the medium by which it is surrounded. If a hell or a
 string is to be sounded, an external force must be applied; and
 this is the cause of the sound.
     If the vibratory motion of a string could take place without
 any resistance, it would vibrate for all time; but in this case no
 sound could be produced, because sound is essentially the pro
pagation of motion ,~ and in the same degree as the string commu
nicates its vibrations to the surrounding and resisting medium
its own motion becomes weaker and weaker, until it at last sinks
into a state of rest.
     The sun has often and appropriately been compared to an in
cessantly sounding bell. But by what means is the power of

this body kept up in undiminished force so-as to enable him to
send forth his rays into the universe in such a grand and mag
ni<U+FB01>cent manner? What are the causes which counteract or
prevent his exhaustion, and thus save the planetary system from
darkness and deadly cold ?
   Some endeavoured to approach “the grand secret,” as Sir Wm.
Herschel calls this question, by the assumption that the rays of
the’ sun, being themselves perfectly cold, merely cause the “ sub
stance ” of heat, supposed to be contained in bodies, to pass from
a state of rest into a state of motion, and that in order to send
forth such cold rays the sun need not be a hot body, so that, in
spite of the in<U+FB01>nite development of light, the cooling of the sun
was a matter not to be thought of.
   It is plain that nothing is gained by such an explanation ; for,
not to speak of the hypothetical “ substance” of heat, assumed
to be at one time at rest and at another time in motion, now
cold and then hot, it is a well-founded fact that the sun does
not radiate a cold phosphorescent light, but a light capable of
warming bodies intensely; and to ascribe such rays to a cold
 body is at once at variance with reason and experience.
   Of course such and similar hypotheses could not satisfy the
demands of exact science, and I will therefore try to explain in
a more satisfactory manner than has been done up to this time
the connexion between the sun’s radiation and its effects. In
doing so, I have to claim the indulgence of scienti<U+FB01>c men, who
are acquainted with the di<U+FB02>iculties of my task.
                        Il. Sources of Heat.
    Before we turn our attention to the special subject of this
 paper, it will be necessary to consider the means by which light
 and heat are produced. Heat may be obtained from very dif
 ferent sources. Combustion, fermentation, putrefaction, slaking
 of lime,‘ the decomposition of chloride of nitrogen and of gun
 cotton, &c. &c., are all of them sources of heat. The electric
 spark, the voltaic current, friction, percussion, and the vital
 processes are also accompanied by the evolution of this agent.
    A general law of nature, which knows of no exception, is the
 following:—In order to obtain heat, something must be expended;
 this something, however different it may be in other respects,
 can always be referred to one of two categories: either it consists
 of some material expended in a chemical process, or of some sort
 of mechanical work.
    When substances endowed with considerable chemical af<U+FB01>nity
 for each other combine chemically, much heat is developed
 during the process. We shall estimate the quantity of heat
 thus set free by the number of kilogrammes of water which it

                Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.                243
would heat 1°C. The quantity of heat necessary to raise one
kilogramme of water one degree is called a unit of heat *.
   It has been established by numerous experiments that the
combustion of one kilogramme of dry charcoal in oxygen, so as
to form carbonic acid, yields 7200 units of heat, which fact may
be brie<U+FB02>y expressed by saying that charcoal furnishes 7200° of
heat.
   Superior coal yields 6000“, perfectly dry wood from 3300° to
3900°, sulphur 2700°, and hydrogen 34,600° of heat.
   According to experience, the number of units of heat only
depends on the quantity of matter which is consumed, and not
on the conditions under which the burning takes place. The
same amount of heat is given out whether the combustion pro
ceeds slowly or quickly, in atmospheric air or in pure oxygen
gas. If in one case a metal be burnt in air and the amount of
heat directly measured, and in another instance the same quan
tity of metal be oxidized in a galvanic battery, the heat being
developed in some other place—say, the wire which conducts
the current,—in both of these experiments the same quantity
of heat will be observed.
   The same law also holds good for the production of heat by
mechanical means. The amount of heat obtained is only de
pendent on the quantity of power consumed, and is quite inde
pendent of the manner in which this power has been expended.
If, therefore, the amount of heat which is produced by certain
mechanical Work is known, the quantity which will be obtained
by any other amount of mechanical work can easily be found by
calculation. It is of no consequence whether this work consists
in the compression, percussion, or friction of bodies.
   The amount of mechanical work done by a force may be
expressed by a weight, and the height to which this weight
would be raised by the same force. The mathematical expression
for “work done,” that is to say, a measure for this work, is
obtained by multiplying the height expressed in feet or other
units by the number of pounds or kilogrammes lifted to this
height.
   We shall take one kilogramme as the unit of weight, and one
metre as the unit of height, and we thus obtain the weight of
one kilogramme raised to the height of one metre as a unit
measure of mechanical work performed. This measure we shall
call a kilogrammetre, and adopt for it the symbol Km 1'.
    Mechanical work may likewise be measured by the velocity
   * The heat requisite to raise 1 kilogramme of water 1° C. will heat 1 lb.
av. of water 3'968l° F.

obtained by a given weight in passing from a state of rest into
that of motion. The work done is then expressed by the
product obtained by the multiplication of the weight by the
square of its velocity. The <U+FB01>rst method, however, because it is
the more convenient, is the one usually adopted ; and the num
bers obtained therefrom may easily be expressed in other units.
    The product resulting from the multiplication of the number
of units of weight and measures of height, or, as it is called, the
product of mass and height, as well as the product of the mas
and the square of its velocity, are called “ 121's viva of motion,”
“ mechanical e<U+FB02>ect,” “dynamical effect,” “ work done,” "quan
tité de travail,” &c. &c.
     The amount of mechanical work necessary for the heating of
 1 kilogramme of water 1° C. has been determined by experiment
 to be =367 Km ; therefore Km=O'OO273 units of heat*.
     A mass which has fallen through a height of 367 metres
 possesses a velocity of 84'8 metres in one second; a mass,
 therefore, moving with this velocity originates 1° C. of heat
 when its motion is lost by percussion, friction, &c.                If the
 velocity be two or three times as great, 4° or 9° of heat will be
 developed. Generally speaking, when the velocity is c metres,
 the corresponding development of heat will be expressed by the
 formula                         0-0o01s9° X c’.
                   III. On the Measure of the Sun’s Heat.
     The actinometer is an instrument invented by Sir John
  Herschel for the purpose of measuring the heating effect pro
  duced by the sun’s rays. It is essentially a thermometer with
  a large cylindrical bulb <U+FB01>lled with a blue liquid, which is acted
  upon by the sun’s rays, and the expansion of which is measured
  by a graduated scale.
      From observations made with this instrument, Sir John
  Herschel calculates the amount of heat received from the sun to
  be sufficient to melt annually at the surface of the globe a crust
  of ice 29'2 metres in thickness.
      Pouillet has recently shown by some careful experiments with
  the lens pyrheliometer, an instrument invented by himself, that
  every square centimetre of the surface of our globe receives, on
  an average, in one minute an amount of solar heat which would
     " How this important result is obtained has been explained in my aper
   “Dig: (l)l‘§8.I1lSCh8 Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem         to<U+FB02>'

     [This essay was published in 1845. At that time de la Roche and Berard’s
   determination of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air was generally accepted. If the
  physical constants used by Mayer be corrected according to the results of
   more recent investigation, the mechanical equivalent of heat is found to be
   77l'4 foot-pounds. Mr. Joule <U+FB01>nds it =772 foot-pounds.-Tn.]

raise the temperature of one gramme of water 04408“. Not
much more than one-half of this quantity of heat, however,
reaches the solid surface of our globe, since a considerable
portion of it is -absorbed by our atmosphere. The layer of ice
which, according to Pouillet, could be melted by the solar heat
which yearly reaches our globe would have a thickness of
3089 metres.
    A square metre of our earth’s surface receives, therefore,
according to Pouillet’s results, which we shall adopt in the
following pages, on an average in one minute 4408 units of
heat. The whole surface of the earth is =9,260,50O geographical
square miles*; consequently the earth receives in one minute
2247 billions of units of heat from the sun.
     In order to obtain smaller numbers, we shall call the quantity
of heat necessary to raise acubic mile of water 1° C. in tempera
ture, a cubic mile of heat. Since one cubic mile of water weighs
40854 billions of kilogrammes, a cubic mile of heat contains
-1»O8'54 billions of units of heat. The effect produced by the‘
rays of the sun on the surface of the earth in one minute is
therefore 5'5 cubic miles of heat.
     Let us imagine the sun to be surrounded by a hollow sphere
whose radius is equal to the mean distance of the earth from
the sun, or 20,589,000 geographical miles; the surface of this
sphere would be equal to 5326 billions of square miles. The
surface obtained by the intersection of this hollow sphere and
our globe, or the base of the cone of solar light which reaches
our earth, stands to the whole surface of this hollow sphere as
*‘~"‘<U+FB02>'*'*°° = 5326 billions, oi as 1 to 2300 millions. This is the
ratio of the heat received by our globe to the whole amount
of heat sent forth from the sun, which latter in one minute
amounts to 12,650 millions of cubic miles of heat.
     This amazing radiation ought, unless the loss is by some
means made good, to cool considerably even a body of the
magnitude of the sun.
     If we assume the sun to be endowed with the same capacity
for heat as a mass of water of the same volume, and its loss of
heat by radiation to affect uniformly its whole mass, the tempe
rature of the sun ought to decrease 1°'8 C. yearly, and for the
historic time of 5000 years this loss would consequently amount
to 9000° C.
     A uniform cooling of the whole of the sun’s huge mass cannot,
however, take place; on the contrary, if the radiation were to occur
at the expense of a given store of heat or radiant power, the sun
    ' The geographical mile =7420 metres, and one English mile =—.1603
metres.

246           Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
would become covered in a short space of time with a cold crust,
whereby radiation would be brought to an end. Considering
the continued activity of the sun through countless centuries,
we may assume with mathematical certainty the existence of
some compensating in<U+FB02>uence to make good its enormous loss.
   Is this restoring agency a chemical process?
   If such were the case, the most favourable assumption would
be to suppose the whole mass of the sun to be one lump of coal,
the combustion of every kilogramme of which produces 6000
units of heat. Then the sun would only be able to sustain for
forty-six centuries its present expenditure of light and heat, not
to mention the oxygen necessary to keep up such an immense
combustion, and other unfavourable circumstances.
   The revolution of the sun on his axis has been suggested as
the cause of his radiating energy. A closer examination proves
this hypothesis also to be untenable.
   Rapid rotation, without friction or resistance, cannot in itself
alone be regarded as a cause of light and heat, especially as the
sun is in no way to be distinguished from the other bodies of
our system by velocity of axial rotation. The sun turns on his
axis in about twenty-<U+FB01>ve days, and his diameter is nearly
112 times as great as that of the earth, from which it follows
that a point on the solar equator travels but a little more than
four times as quickly as a point on the earth’s equator. The
largest planet of the solar system, whose diameter is about —11q;th
that of the sun, turns on its axis in less than ten hours; a point
on its equator revolves about six times quicker than one on the
solar equator. The outer ring of Saturn exceeds the sun’s
equator more than ten times in velocity of rotation. Never
theless no generation of light or heat is observed on our globe,

on ItJupiter, be on       thatoffriction,
                    the ring
                 thought         Saturn. though undeveloped in the i
case of the other celestial bodies, might be engendered by the
sun’s rotation, and that such friction might generate enormous
quantities of heat.     But for the production of friction two
bodies, at least, are always necessary which are in immediate
contact with one another, and which move with different velo
cities or in different directions. Friction, moreover, has a.
tendency to produce equal motion of the two rubbing bodies;          -!~—'
and when this is attained, the generation of heat ceases. If
now the sun be the one moving body, where is the other? and
if the second body exist, what power prevents it from assuming
the same rotatory motion as the sun ?
   But could even these difficulties be disregarded, a weightier
and more formidable obstacle opposes this hypothesis.          The
known volume and mass of the sun allow us to calculate the

               Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.             247
vis viva which he possesses in consequence of his rotation.
Assuming his density to be uniform throughout his mass, and
his period of rotation twenty-<U+FB01>ve days, it is equal to 182,300
quintillions of kilogrammetres (Km). But for one unit of heat
generated, 367 Km are consumed; consequently the whole
rotation-effect of the sun could only cover the expenditure of heat
for the space of 183 years.
    IV. The Organization of the Planetary System contains the
                       Cause of the Sun’s Heat.
    The space of our solar system is <U+FB01>lled with a great number of
ponderahle objects, which have a tendency to move towards the
centre of gravity of the sun ; and in so doing, their rate of motion
is more and more accelerated.
    A mass, without motion, placed within the sphere of the sun’s
attraction, will obey this attraction, and, if there be no disturbing
in<U+FB02>uences, will fall in a straight line into the sun.      In reality,
however, such a rectilinear path can scarcely occur, as may be
shown by experiment.
    Let a weight be suspended by a string so that it can only
touch the <U+FB02>oor in one point. Lift the weight up to a certain
height, and at the same time stretch the string out to its full
length ; if the weight be now allowed to fall, it will be observed,
almost in every case, not to reach at once the point on the <U+FB02>oor
towards which it tends to move, but to move round this point
for some time in a curved line.
    The reason of this phenomenon is that the slightest deviation
 of the weight from its shortest route towards the point on the
 <U+FB02>oor, caused by some disturbing in<U+FB02>uence such as the resistance
 of the air against a not perfectly uniform surface, will maintain
 itself as long as motion lasts. It is nevertheless possible for the
 weight to move at once to the point ; the probability of its doing
 so, however, becomes the less as the height from which it is
 allowed to drop increases or the string, by means of which it is
 suspended, is lengthened.
 _ Similar laws in<U+FB02>uence the movements of bodies in the space
 of the solar system. The height of the fall is here represented
 by the original distance from the sun at which the body begins
 to move; the length of the string by the sun’s attraction, which
 increases when the distance decreases; and the small surface of
 contact on the floor by the area of the section of the sun’s
 sphere. If now a cosmical mass within the physical limits of
 the sun’s sphere of attraction begins its fall towards that
 heavenly body, it will be disturbed in its long path for many
 centuries, at <U+FB01>rst by the nearest <U+FB01>xed stars, and afterwards by
 the bodies of the solar system. Motion of such a mass in a

248       M.Viktor von Lang on the Crystalline Form and
straight line, or its perpendicular fall into the sun, would
therefore, under such conditions, be impossible. The observed
movement of all planetary bodies in closed curves agrees with
this.
   We shall now return to the example of the weight suspended
by a string and oscillating round a point towards which it is
attracted. The diameters of the orbits described by this weight
are observed to be nearly equal; continued observation, how
ever, shows that these diameters gradually diminish in length,
so that the weight will by degrees approach the point in which
it can touch the <U+FB02>oor. The weight, however, touches the <U+FB02>oor
not in a mathematical point, but in a small surface; as soon,
therefore, as the diameter of the curve in which the weight
moves is equal to the diameter of this surface, the weight will
touch the <U+FB02>oor. This <U+FB01>nal contact is no accidental or improbable
event, but a necessary phenomenon caused by the resistance
which the oscillating mass constantly suffers from the air and
friction.   If all resistance could be annihilated, the motion of
the weight would of course continue in equal oscillations.
   The same law holds good for celestial bodies.

XXXV. On the Crystalline Form and Optical Properties of Sul

    The faces are very brilliant, and have an adamantine lustre,
 probably due to the greater predominance (from its high che
 mical equivalent) of the element thallium in the compound:
 thallium may thus be supposed to stand in the same relation to
 potassium that lead does to the isomorphous barium.
    With regard to the optical properties of these crystals, I found,
 on laying one of them on the large plane (1 O0) in the polari
 zing apparatus, that, from the absence of interference-curves and
 black hyperbolas, this plane is probably parallel to the plane of
 the optic axes, and that therefore the axis a is parallel to the
 axis of mean optical elasticity. Trying the compensating action
 of a section of quartz, interference-curves were produced when
 the quartz was turned on an axis parallel to the crystallographic
 axis c; the interference-fringes thus produced were parallel with
 the same direction. We may conclude from this experiment
 that the smallest axis c coincides with the axis of least optical
 elasticity, and that the mean crystallographic axis is parallel to
 the greatest axis of elasticity. The optical orientation of these
 crystals is therefore given by the symbol
                                 Bar.
    I succeeded afterwards in splitting out of one of the crystals
 a section across the direction in which the crystals are prolon
 gated. This section showed directly, by the appearance of
 coloured curves, that the plane of the optic axes is parallel with

250      M. G. Kirchhoff on the History of Spectrum Analysis
the plane (1 00). It seemed, moreover, that this section is per
pendicular to the <U+FB01>rst mean line, although the points of the
optic axes were not in the <U+FB01>eld of view. In consequence the
crystals would be positive. The double refraction is weak.
   The following Table contains the optical orientation of the
salts isomorphous with the sulphate of potassium which I have
hitherto had the opportunity of examining :—

   It will be seen from this Table that, in its optical properties,
the sulphate of thallium accords with the ammonium, and not
with the potassium salt. It would not only be interesting to
<U+FB01>ll up some of the blanks of the above Table, but also of import
ance to investigate at least the sulphates of the new elements
caesium and rubidium, which belong to the same isomorphous
 group. Another desirable object of investigation would be the
in<U+FB02>uence exercised on the optical orientation by the substitution
of alcohol radicals in the sulphate of ammonium, provided
these new combinations are isomorphous with their original type,
which, as far as I am aware, has hardly been proved by measure
ments even in the case of the simplest of these bodies.
XXXVI. Contributions towards the History of Spectrum Analysis
    and of the Analysis of the Solar Atmosphere. By G. KIRCH
    HOFF *.
     N my ‘ Researches on the Solar Spectrum and the Spectra of
        the Chemical Elements’ 1', I made a few short historical
 remarks concerning earlier investigations upon the same subject.
 In these remarks I have passed over certain publications in
 silence—in some cases because I was unacquainted with them,
 in others because they appeared to me to possess no special
 interest in relation to the history of the discoveries in question.
 Having become aware of the existence of the former class, and
 seeing that more weight has been considered to attach to the

   ‘I’ Published by MacMillan and Co., Cambridge and London, 1862.

            and of the Analysis of the Solar Atmoiyihere.        251
latter class of publications by others than by myself, I will now
endeavour to complete the historical survey.
   1. Amongst those who have devoted themselves to the ob
servation of the spectra of coloured <U+FB02>ames, I must, in the <U+FB01>rst
place, mention Herschel and Talbot. Their names need special
notice, as they pointed outwith distinctness the service which
this mode of observation is capable of rendering to the chemist.
For a knowledge of their researches I am mainly indebted to
Prof. W. Allen Miller, who gave an extract from them in a lecture
republished in the number of the ‘ Chemical News’ for 19th April,
1862. It is there stated that in the volume of the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1822, at p. 455, Herschel
shortly describes the spectra of chloride of strontium, chloride
of potassium, chloride of copper, nitrate of copper, and boracic
acid.    The same observer says, in his article on Light in the
Encyclopedia Metropolitana, 1827, p. 438,-“ Salts of soda give
a copious and purely homogeneous yellow; of potash, a bean
tiful pale violet.” He then describes the colours given by the
salts of lime, strontia, lithia, baryta, copper, and iron, and con
tinues-“ Of all salts the muriates succeed best, from their
volatility. The same colours are exhibited also when any of the
salts in question are put (in powder) into the wick of a spirit
lamp. .      . . . . The colours thus communicated by the dif
ferent bases to <U+FB02>ame afford in many cases a ready and neat way
of detecting extremely minute quantities of them . . . . . . The
pure earths, when violently heated, as has recently been practised
by Lieut. Drummond, by directing on small spheres of them
 the <U+FB02>ames of several spirit-lamps, urged by oxygen gas, yield
 from their surfaces lights of extraordinary splendour, which,
 when examined by prismatic analysis, are found to possess the
 peculiar de<U+FB01>nite rays in excess which characterize the tints of
<U+FB02>ames coloured by them; so that there can be no doubt that
 these tints arise from the molecules of the colouring matter,
 reduced to vapour and held in a state of violent ignition.”
     Talbot says *, “ The <U+FB02>ame of sulphur and nitre contains a. red
 ray which appears to me of a remarkable nature. . . . . . .
 This red ray appears to possess a de<U+FB01>nite refrangibility, and
 to be characteristic of the salts of potash, as the yellow ray is of
 the salts of soda, although, from its feeble illuminating power,
 it is only to be detected with a prism. If this should be ad
 mittcd, I would further suggest that whenever the prism shows
 a homogeneous ray of any colour to exist in a <U+FB02>ame, this ray
 indicates the formation or the presence of a definite chemical
 compound.” Somewhat further on, in speaking of the spectrum
    ;lBrewster’s Journal of Science, v., 1826. Chemical News, April 27,
 18    .

252      M. G. Kirchhoff on the History of Spectrum Analysis
of red-<U+FB01>re and of the frequent occurrence of the yellow line, he
says, “The other lines may be attributed to the antimony,
strontia,‘ &c. which enter into this composition.        For instance,
the orange ray may be the effect of the strontia, since Mr. Her
schel found in the <U+FB02>ame of muriate of strontia a ray of that
colour.     If this opinion should be correct, and applicable to the
other de<U+FB01>nite rays, a glance at the prismatic spectrum of a <U+FB02>ame
may show it to contain substances which it would otherwise re
quire a laborious chemical analysis to detect.” In a subsequent
communication *, the same physicist, after a striking description
of the spectra of lithium and strontium, continues—“ Hence I
hesitate not to say that optical analysis can distinguish the
minutest portions of these two substances from each other with
as much certainty, if not more, than any other known method.”
    In these expressions the idea of “ chemical analysis by
spectrum-observations ” is most clearly put forward. Other
statements, however, of the same observers, occurring in the
same memoirs from which the foregoing quotations are taken
(but not mentioned by Prof. Miller in his abstract), <U+FB02>atly con
tradict the above conclusions, and place the foundations of this
mode of analysis on most uncertain ground.
     Herschel, in page 438 of his article on Light, almost imme
diately before the words quoted above, says—“ In certain cases
when the combustion is violent, as in the case of an oil-lamp
urged by a blowpipe (according to Fraunhofer), or in the upper
part of the <U+FB02>ame of a spirit-lamp, or when sulphur is thrown
into a white-hot crucible, a very large quantity of a de<U+FB01>nite and
purely homogeneous yellow light is produced; and in the latter
case forms nearly the whole of the light. Dr. Brewster has also
found the same yellow light to be produced when spirit of wine,
diluted with water and heated, is set on <U+FB01>re.”
    Talbot states 1'—“ Hence the yellow rays may indicate the
presence of soda, but they nevertheless frequently appear
where no soda can be supposed to be present.” He then
mentions that the yellow light of burning sulphur, discovered
by Herschel, is identical with the light of the <U+FB02>ame of a spirit
lamp with a salted wick, and states that he was inclined to believe
that the yellow light which occurred when salt was strewed
upon a platinum foil placed in a <U+FB02>ame “ was owing to the water
of crystallization rather than to the soda; but then,” be con
tinues, “ it is not easy to explain why the salts of potash, &c.
should not produce it likewise.       VVood, ivory, paper, &c., when
placed in the gas-<U+FB02>ame, give off, besides their bright <U+FB02>ame,

more or less of this yellow light, which I have always found the
same in its characters.        The only principle which these various
bodies have in common with the salts of soda is water; yet I
think that the formation or presence of water cannot be the
origin of this yellow light, because ignited sulphur produces the
very same, a substance with which water is supposed to have no
analogy.”        “ It may be worth remark,” he adds in a note,
“ though probably accidental, that the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of sulphur‘
is 1'99, or almost exactly twice that of water.” “ It is also re
markable,” he continues in the text, “that alcohol burnt in an
open vessel, or in a lamp with a metallic wick, gives but little of
the yellow light; while if the wick be of cotton it gives a con
 siderable quantity, and that for an unlimited time. (I have
 found other instances of a change of colour in <U+FB02>ames, owing to
 the mere presence of the substance, which sufers no diminution in
 consequence. Thus a particle of muriate of lime on the wick of
 a spirit-lamp will produce a quantity of red and green rays for
 a whole evening without being itself sensibly diminished”
      In a later portion of the memoir he attributes the yellow line
 in one place to the presence of soda-salts, at another to that of
  sulphur. Thus, in the above-mentioned statement concerning
  the spectrum of red-<U+FB01>re, he says, “ The bright line in the yellow
  is caused, without doubt, by the combustion of the sulphur” 1'.
       Hence we must admit that the conclusion that the aforesaid
  yellow line can be taken as a positive proof of the presence of
  sodium-compounds in the <U+FB02>ame can in no way be deduced from
  Herschel and Talbot’s researches. On the contrary, the nume
  rous modes in which the line is produced would rather point to
  the conclusion that it is dependent upon no chemical constituent
  of the <U+FB02>ame, but arises by a process whose nature is unknown,
  which may occur, sometimes more easily, sometimes with diffi
   culty, with the most di<U+FB01>erent chemical elements. If we accept
   such an explanation concerning this yellow line, we must form
   a similar opinion respecting the other lines seen in the spectrum
   which were far more imperfectly examined ; and in this we should
   be strengthened by the statement of Talbot, that a. piece of
   chloride of calcium by its mere presence in the wick of a <U+FB02>ame,
   and without su<U+FB02>eriny any diminution, causes a red and a green
   line to appear in the spectrum.                         0

searches on the Solar Spectrum and Spectra of the Chemical
Elements,’ MacMillan, London, 1862, p. 8), as well as those of
Despretz*, from which this physicist concluded that the posi
tions of the bright lines in the spectrum of the light from a
galvanic battery were unaltered by variation of the intensity of
the current, might serve to support the view that the bright
lines in the spectrum of an incandescent gas are solely depend
ent upon the several chemical constituents of the gas; but they
could not be considered as proof of such an opinion, as the con
ditions under which they were made were, for this purpose, too
complicated, and the phenomena occurring in an electric spark
too ill understood. The demonstrative power of the above ex
periments as regards the question at issue is rendered less cogent
by the difference visible in the colour of the electric light in dif
ferent parts of a Geissler’s tube ; by the circumstance noticed by
Van der Willigen, who obtained different spectra by passing an
electric spark from the same electrodes through gas of constant
chemical composition if the density of the gas was varied within
su<U+FB02>icient limits; and lastly by an observation which ilngstrom
cursorily mentions. This physicist says1', “Wheatstone has
already noticed that when the poles consist of two di<U+FB02>'erent
metals the spectrum contains the lines of both metals. Hence
it became of interest to see whether a compound of these metals,
especially a chemical compound, also gives the lines of both
metals, or whether the compound is distinguished by the occur
rence of new lines. Experiment shows that the <U+FB01>rst supposition
is correct.   The sole difference noticed is, that certain lines were
wanting or appeared with less distinctness ; but when they were
observed they always appeared in the position in which they oc
curred in the separate metals.” In the following sentence, how
ever, he states “ That in the case of zinc and tin the lines in the
blue were somewhat displaced in the direction of the violet end,
but the displacement was very inconsiderable.” Had such a
displacement, however small, really occurred, we must conclude
either that the bright lines of the electric spark obey other laws
than those of a glowing gas, or that these latter are not solely
dependent on the separate chemical constituents of the gas.
    The question at issue respecting the lines of incandescent
gases could only be satisfactorily solved by experiments carried

  they do not furnish any contribution towards a solution of the
  question. Dr. Miller has the merit of having <U+FB01>rst published
  diagrams of the spectra of <U+FB02>ames *; but these diagrams are but
" slightly successful, although in a republication in the ‘ Che
  mical News’1' of the paper accompanying these drawings, Mr.
  Crookes remarks——“ We cannot, of course, give the coloured
  diagrams with which it was orignally illustrated; but we can
  assure our readers that, after making allowance for the im
  perfect state of chromolithography sixteen years ago I, the dia
  grams of the spectra given by Prof. Miller are more accurate
  in several respects than the coloured spectra <U+FB01>gured in recent
  numbers of the scienti<U+FB01>c periodicals.” In reply to this “as
  surance ” of Mr. Crookes I only have to remark that, by way of
  experiment, I have laid Prof. Miller’s diagrams before several
   persons conversant with the special spectra, requesting them to
   point out the drawing intended to represent the spectrum of
   strontium, barium, and calcium respectively, and that in no
   instance have the right ones been selected.
        Swan was the <U+FB01>rst who endeavoured experimentally to prove
   whether the almost invariably occurring yellow line may be
   solely caused by the presence of sodium-compounds. In his
   classical research “ On the Spectra of the Flames of the Hydro
   carbons” § (referred to both in my ‘Researches’ and in the
   paper published by Bunsen and myself), Swan shows how small
    the quantity of sodium is which produces this line distinctly; he
   <U+FB01>nds that this quantity is minute beyond conception, and he con
   eludes—“When indeed we consider the almost universal diffusion
    of the salts of sodium, and the remarkable energy with which they
    produce yellow light, it seems highly probable that the yellow line
    R, which appears in the spectra of almost all <U+FB02>ames, is in every
    case due to the presence of minute quantities of sodium.”
        The strict subject-matter of Swan’s investigation was the
    comparison of the spectra of <U+FB02>ames of various hydrocarbons.
    “ The result of this comparison has been, that in all the
    spectra produced by substances, either of the form C‘ H5, or of
   the form Cr HS 0*, the bright lines have been identical. In
    some cases, indeed, certain of the very faint lines which occur
    in the spectrum of the Bunsen lamp were not seen. The bright

  ness of the lines varies with the proportion of carbon to hydro
   gen in the substance which is burned, being greatest where
  there is most carbon. . . . . The absolute identity which is thus
  shown to exist between the spectra of dissimilar carhohydrogen
  compounds is not a little remarkable. It proves, lst, that the
  position of the lines in the spectrum does not vary with the
  proportion of carbon and hydrogen in the burning body-—
  as when we compare the spectra of light carburetted hydrogen
  C H”, ole<U+FB01>ant gas C’ H9, and oil of turpentine, C“) H8 ; and
  2ndly, that the presence of oxygen does not alter the character
  of the spectrum ; thus ether, C4 H5 O, and wood spirit, C2 H4 0*,
  give spectra which are identical with those of paraffin, CQ0 HQ°,
  and oil of turpentine, C90 H8.
     “In certain cases, at least, the mechanical admixture of other
 substances with the carbohydrogen compound does not a<U+FB02>'ect
  the lines of the spectrum.     Thus, I have found that a mixture
 of alcohol and chloroform burns with a <U+FB02>ame having a very
  luminous green envelope-—an appearance characteristic of the
 presence of chlorine—and no lines are visible in the spectrum.
 When, however, the <U+FB02>ame is urged by the blowpipe, the light
 of the envelope is diminished, and the ordinary lines of the hy
 drocarbon spectrum become visible.”
     In this research, Swan has made a most valuable contribu
 tion towards the solution of the proposed question as to whether
 the bright lines of a glowing gas are solely dependent upon
 its chemical constituents; but he did not answer it positively,
 or in its most general form ; he did not indeed enter upon this
 question, for he wished to con<U+FB01>ne his investigation to the spectra
 of the hydrocarbons, and was only led to the examination of this
yellow line by its frequent occurrence in these spectra.
    No one, it appears, had clearly propounded this question
before Bunsen and myself; and the chief aim of our common
investigation was to decide this point. Experiments which were
greatly varied, and were for the most part new, led us to the con
clusion upon which the foundations of the “chemical analysis
 by spectrum-observations ” now rest.
    2. I have likewise a few remarks to make concerning the
history of the Chemical Analysis of the Solar Atmosphere.
    The substance of the theory of solar chemistry which I have
developed consists of a proposition which may be shortly stated
as follows:—The relation between the power of emission and
the power of absorption for each kind of rays (heat or light) is
the same for all bodies at the same temperature. From this
proposition it easily follows that a glowing body which emits only
rays of certain wave-lengths, likewise absorbs only rays of the
same wave-lengths ; and from this we learn how the dark lines

              and of the Analysis of the Solar Atmosphere. -          257
in the solar spectrum reveal the constituents of the sun's atmo
 splgere.
    Angstrom, in his “Optischen Untersuchungen”*, states the
 proposition that a body “in the state of incandescence must
 emit exactly all those kinds of light which it absorbs at the
common temperature.” Then follow these words: “ The proof
 of the truth of the above proposition is accompanied by great
 difficulties, because the elastic relations of a glowing body are
quite different from those under which its power of absorption
is examined.” These words convey no meaning as they stand;
they become, however, intelligible if we suppose that Angstrom
 really meant his proposition to imply that a body in the glow
ing condition must emit exactly all those kinds of light which
at the same temperature it absorbs. Such an interpretation is,
however, by no means favoured by the statement which imme
diately follows; for he adds :-
    “An indirect proof of the truth of this proposition is, how
ever, given by the fact discovered by M. Niépce de Saint-Victor
of the relation existing between the colour which a body imparts
to a <U+FB02>ame of alcohol, and that which light produces upon a silver
plate which has been treated with the chloride of the body in
question. Thus a plate of silver treated with chlorine alone,
assumes all the colours of the spectrum, but treated at the same
time with a body capable of producing colour, it exhibits almost
exclusively the colour which the body produces; this can only
be explained by the prepared plate absorbing exactly the colour
which the body in question imparts to a <U+FB02>ame.” Without en
deavouring to follow this “ proof” further, we see at once that
the radiation of a soda-<U+FB02>ame, for example, is here compared
with the absorption effected by a cold plate of silver treated with
common salt.
    The meaning which is to be attached to this proposition is,
however, rendered altogether doubtful by a remark which Ang
strom makes in page 143 of the memoir above cited. He here
states, “ It is needful to observe that a medium not only absorbs
the vibrations which it can most easily take up, but likewise
those which stand in a simple relation to them, such as octave,
third, &c.” In order to see how these statements contradict each
other, let us suppose abody which can take up certain vibrations
with equal facility, but is incapable of taking up certain others ,
according to Angstr6m’s proposition, found in page 144 of his
memoir, this body can only absorb the <U+FB01>rst kinds of vibrations ;
according to the remarks found in page 143, it must exert an

258        M. G. Kirchhoff on the History of Spectrum Analysis
absorptive action not only upon these, but also upon certain
other vibrations.
    It is seen that the proposition which forms the basis of the
chernipal analysis of the.solar atmosphere <U+FB02>oated before Ang
strom s mind, but only, _1n_deed,_1n dim outline.          The leading
idea in the theoretical considerations upon which Angstrom en
deavours to base the subject is the same as that which Stokes *
has carried out more correctly on a later occasion when speak
ing of my <U+FB01>rst publication respecting the reversal of the pectra
of <U+FB02>ames. Stokes here compares the absorption which such a
<U+FB02>ame exerts u on the kind of ra s which it emits, to the reso
nance which is excited in a body Zapable of taking up the vibra
tions of sound by a wave of sound of the same pitch as that
which the body is capable of emitting.          This comparison, if it
can be followed out, may lead to the most important conclusions ;
but, in the manner In which Stokes gives it, it is of interest
because it affords a good illustration of such an absorption,
although it does not yield a proof of the proposition that a
glowing body which emits only rays of certain wave-lengths
also absorbs olntlly rays of tlfie<U+FB02>same vgavi-lengt(l;s.b Thp_theoi1_-y<U+FB01>vf
resonance, an         e eoryo        e pro uc ion an a sorp ion 0        e
rays of light and heat, are still not su<U+FB02>iciently advanced to
enable us at present to prove the proposition in question by any
such comparison.
    3. In the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for
tl11f§;:‘.<U+FB02>}.:' 1858, a paper was published by Balfour Stewart, in
W ic e describes very interesting experiments upon the radia
tion and absorption of partially diathermanous plates. He <U+FB01>nds
that it platp of ropk-sall: is lless diatherinanous for rays emitted by
anot er p ate 0 roc -sat heated to 100° C., than for those
which are emitted from a surface of lampblack at the same tem
perature. From these and similar henomena which lates of
glass and mica exhibit, he concludes ‘?that every body wliich sifts
heat in its passage through its substance is more opake with
regard to heat radiated by a thin slice of its own substance, than
it is with regard to ordinary heat.” He then recalls the prin
ciple <U+FB01>rst enunciated by Prevost, that a body placed in a medium
of the same temperature must absorb as much heat as it emits
itself; and then he says, “Considering, therefore, the heat of
any temperature to consist of heterogeneous rays, we may state
the law thus 1 The absorption of a plate equals its radiation, and
that for every description of heat.”
    This proof cannot be a strict one, because experiments which
have only taught us concerning more and less, cannot strictly
teach us concerning equality.           The proposition founded upon
                          * Phil. Mag. March 1860.

            and of the Analysis of the Solar Atmosphere.            259
this conclusion cannot be considered to be thus proved, but
must be taken as an hypothesis needinga stricter demonstration,
as well as a greater precision in the terms employed. Stewart
himself does not consider that his proposition is thus rigidly
demonstrated; for immediately after the enunciation of it he
says, “a more rigid demonstration may be given thusz” and
then he proceeds to more abstruse considerations which are
intended to give such a rigid demonstration, and in which the
meaning he attaches to the expressions absorption and radiation
are more nearly de<U+FB01>ned. These considerations, however, are
not sufficiently general or suf<U+FB01>ciently precise to attain the re
quired end; so that, after all, Stewart’s proposition remainstan
hypothesis to which some probability is attached.
   Stewart <U+FB01>nds from his experiments that partially diather
manous plates radiate the more heat the thicker they are, and
hence he concludes, with perfect right, that the radiation proceeds
from the interior of bodies as well as from the surface. The
question then occurs, “ Are we to suppose each particle of each
substance to have at a given temperature an independent radia
tion of its own, equal, of course, in all directions '? ” “ /I priori,”
he continues, “this is the most probable supposition; and it
seems likewise to be conformable to experiment.” The principle
expressed in these words is the test of the truth of the proposi
tion, according to the proof which Stewart endeavours to give.
He says, “ The question arises, Is the law of an equal and inde
pendent radiation of each particle of a body theoretically con
sistent with equilibrium of temperature? That is, suppose we
have any irregularly-shaped enclosure walled round with a variety
of substances, and each particle of each substance radiating into
the enclosure,—from the sides of which it is re<U+FB02>ected many
times backwards and forwards before it is <U+FB01>nally absorbed,—this
being the case, will the law of equal and independent radiation,
and those of re<U+FB02>exion and refraction so <U+FB01>t with one another,
that every particle of the walls of the enclosure shall absorb
precisely as much heat as it radiates? It will be endeavoured
to show that these laws are so adapted to each other.”
   By employing the law “ of equal and independent radiation”
and the laws of re<U+FB02>exion and refraction, Stewart forms the equa
tion expressing the proposition which has to be proved con
 cerning the equality of absorption and radiation for heat of
every kind. It appears that this equation contains no contra
diction, but expresses a possible property of the internal radia
tion in a body. He argues from this that the proposition con
 cerning the equality of absorption and radiation for every kind of
 ray must hold good. This is evidently a false conclusion. The
                                 S2

260      M. G. Kirchhoff on the History of Spectrum Analysis
above consideration proves that the proposition is possibly, but
not that it is necessarily true.
   The proposition under consideration is subsequently not car
ried out so generally as it is enunciated in the above-cited words,
but only for a very special case. In connexion with these words
he says, “ and I shall select for the proof a de<U+FB01>nite form
and description of enclosure—the conclusions arrived at ren
dering it highly probable (if not rigidly demonstrated) that the
same adaptation will hold good for every enclosure however
irregular or varied.” The case which he considers is that of a
body limited only by one plane with a black surface placed op
posite and parallel to the plane. In the proof which Stewart
 in this case gives for his assertion, there is, lastly, an error
 which is rendered evident in the results at which the author
arrives.    He concludes, “ We have, therefore, two laws neces
 sary to the equilibrium of temperature: let, that the absorp
tion of a particle is equal to its radiation, and that for every
 description of heat ; 2nd, that the <U+FB02>ow of heat from the interior
 upon the surface of a substance of inde<U+FB01>nite thickness is pro
 portional, creteris paribus, to its index of refraction, and that
 for every description of heat.” This second law (corresponding
 to the equation which, as already mentioned, expresses a possible
 property of the internal radiation of a body) is not correct; the
 magnitude therein considered is not proportional to the index of
 refraction but to its square *. On a later occasion1' Stewart
 himself states (without, however, noticing his former contra
 dictory assertion), “ Now if R denote the radiation of lamp
 black, and /.4. the index of refraction of an uncrystallized medium,
 it may be shown that the internal radiation as thus de<U+FB01>ned is
 equal to R/L2.”
    4. At the close of Prof.W.A. Miller’s paper on coloured <U+FB02>ames,
 before alluded to, he states, “ It may be interesting to remark,
 in connexion with the speculations on the absorptive action of
 the sun’s atmosphere, that if solar light be transmitted through
 a <U+FB02>ame exhibiting well-marked black lines, the lines reappear
 in the compound spectrum, provided the light of day be not too
 intense compared with that of the coloured <U+FB02>ame. This may be
 seen in the red light of the nitrate of strontia, and less perfectly
 in the green light of the chloride of copper. It would there
 fore appear that luminous atmospheres exist in which not only
 certain rays are wanting, but which exercise a positive absorp
 tive in<U+FB02>uence on other lights.” In his lecture “ On Spectrum
    ‘ See Kirchhoff, Untersuchungen, &c. 2te Ausgabe, Berlin, 1862, S. 37.

            and of the Analysis of the Solar Atnwsphere.           261
Analysis,” reprinted in the ‘ Chemical News ’ of April 19, 1862,
Prof. Miller quotes these words without making any remark
upon the relation in which his observations, and the conclusion
which he draws from them, stand to what I have discovered.
In the Number of the same Journal for May 18, 1862, Mr.
Crookes writes with reference to these same words, “This para
graph shows that Prof. Miller has anticipated by nearly sixteen
years, the remarkable discovery, ascribed to Kirchhoff, of the
opacity of certain coloured <U+FB02>ames to light of their own colour.”
We need only to read Miller’s words with some slight attention
to perceive, not only that the conclusion to which he arrives is
exactly the opposite of mine, but likewise that his conclusion is
incorrect. If weal: daylight be allowed to pass through a co
loured <U+FB02>ame, the absorption of the latter is not noticeable; its
bright lines appear brighter than the surrounding parts, because
in them the light of the <U+FB02>ame is present in addition to the day
light.
   5. Soon after my <U+FB01>rst short publication* concerning the che
mical analysis of the solar atmosphere, I received the following
communication in a letter from Prof. VVm. Thomson :—“Professor
Stokes mentioned to me at Cambridge some time, probably
about ten years, ago, that Professor Miller!‘ had made an
experiment testing to a very high degree of accuracy the agree
ment of the double dark line D of the solar spectrum with the
double bright line constituting the spectrum of the spirit-lamp
burning with salt. I remarked that there must be some physical
connexion between two agencies presenting so marked a charac
teristic in common. He assented, and said he believed a me
chanical explanation of the cause was to be had on some such
principles as the following :——Vapour of sodium must possess
by its molecular structure a tendency to vibrate in the periods
corresponding to the degree of refrangibility of the double line
1). Hence the presence of sodium in a source of light must
tend to originate light of that quality. On the other hand,
vapour of sodium in an atmosphere round a source, must have a
great tendency to retain in itself, 1'. e. to absorb and have its
temperature raised by light from the source of the precise
quality in question. In the atmosphere around the sun, there
fore, there must be present vapour of sodium, which, according
to the mechanical explanation thus suggested, being particularly
opake for light of that quality, prevents such of it as is emitted
from the sun from penetrating to any considerable distance
through the surrounding atmosphere. The test of this theory
must be had in ascertaining whether or not vapour of sodium has

the special absorbing power anticipated. I have the impression
that some Frenchmen did make this out by experiment, but I_
can <U+FB01>nd no reference on that point.                       p
    “ I am not sure whether Prof. Stokes’s suggestion of a
mechanical theory has ever appeared in print. I have given it in
my lectures regularly for many years, always pointing out along
with it that solar and stellar chemistry were to be studied by
investigating terrestrial substances giving bright lines in the
spectra of arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>ames corresponding to the dark lines of
the solar and stellar spectra.”
   At page 158 of the Philosophical Magazine for February
1862, Professor Thomson says, “The last eight or nine years
Stokes’s principles of solar and stellar chemistry have been
taught in the public lectures on natural philosophy in the
University of Glasgow ; and it has been shown as a <U+FB01>rst result,
that there is certainly sodium in the sun’s atmosyihere. The
recent application of these principles in the splendid researches
of Bunsen and Kirchhoff (who made an independent discovery
of Stokes’s theory) has demonstrated with equal certainty that
there are iron and manganese, and several of our other known
metals, in the sun.”
   From the above letter, which at my desire was printed in the
Philosophical Magazine, S. 3. vol. xx. p. 20, and translated into
the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, sér. 3. vol. lxii. p. 190, it is
clear that many years ago Stokes in conversation had thrown
out the idea that it would perhaps be possible to argue from the
dark lines of the solar spectrum concerning the chemical consti
tution of the atmosphere of the sun. That this idea is correct—
that a <U+FB02>ame does, in fact, exert the absorption which Stokes
ascribed to it, and that from the bright lines in the spectrum of
an incandescent gas the chemical components of the gas can
with certainty be deduced—was <U+FB01>rst proved by my theoretical
considerations, and by experiments which I have made partly in
conjunction with Bunsen, and partly alone. Hence it appears
that no one had formerly (during a period of ten years) published
anything concerning the opinion which Stokes expressed in
conversation. In singular contradiction to this, stands Prof.
Thomson’s recent statement, “that Stokes’s principles of solar
chemistry have shown as a <U+FB01>rst result, that there certainly is
sodium in the sun’s atmosphere ;” and further, “The recent ap
plication of these principles by Bunsen and Kirchho<U+FB02>" (who made
an independent discovery of Stokes’s theory) has demonstrated
with equal certainty the presence of other metals in the sun ”*.

  XXXVII. Reply to Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on a paper on
-    “Energy” in ‘Good Words.’ By P. G. TAIT, M.A., F.R.S.E'.,
     Professor ofNatural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh.
        MY DEAR Sm DAVID Bnnwsrnn,
  A-S an Editor of the Philosophical Magazine you are doubtless
        aware that Prof. Tyndall has, in the last published Number
  of that journal, taken exception to certain portions of an article
  on “ Energy," published by Prof. Thomson and myself in ‘ Good
 Words ’ in October 1862.          We feel that Prof. Tyndall’s remarks
 cannot be    allowed to pass without a reply, although we are most
 unwilling    to introduce into the pages of the Philosophical
  Magazine     matters directly personal to individuals. I shall
  therefore,  as Prof. Thomson has requested me to reply for him
  as well as for myself, proceed to consider Prof. Tyndall’s obser
  vations as brie<U+FB02>y as I possibly can.
     I think it right at starting to call Prof. Tyndall’s attention to
  the fact that, in the Philosophical Magazine (1862, second half
 year, p. 65), he has published the following words :—“ I do not
 think a greater disservice could be done to a man of science than
  to overstate his claims: such overstatement is sure to recoil to
  the disadvantage of him in whose interest it is made,”-—and to‘
  remind him that any unpleasant results which may follow from
  the course he has pursued are, by his own acknowledgment, to
  be laid to his charge.
     First, then, as to the medium in which our article appeared,
  and the grave offence of putting two names to it instead of one.
  A journal which contains in nearly every Number a scienti<U+FB01>c
  paper by yourself, Forbes, Herschel, or Piazzi Smyth, can surely
  not be regarded as unsuitable for a paper on “Energy.” I <U+FB01>rst
  saw a report of Prof. Tyndall’s lecture (with its extraordinary
  statements regarding Mayer) in the pages of the ‘Illustrated
  London News ’ and the ‘ Engineer.’ I am not aware that these
  are journals specially employed by scienti<U+FB01>c men for the judicial
  discussion of recondite points in science or its history; nor can
  I consider a Royal Institution audience as a body quali<U+FB01>ed to
  decide upon such questions. An evident consequence of Prof.
  1862), “ These facts,” of thejcoincidence of dark and bright lines, “re
  mained altogether barren of consequences, as far as regards the explana~
  tion of the phenomena, except to a few bold minds, such as Angstrom,
  Stokes, and William Thomson; the latter two of whom, combining this
 fact with an ill-understood experiment of Foueault’ s made in 1849, fore
  saw the conclusions to which they must lead, and expressed an opinion
  which subsequent investigations have fully home out. Clear light was,
 however, thrown upon the subject by Kirchho<U+FB02>’ in the autumn of 1859,
 &c.”-H. E. R.]

   264       Prof. Tait on the Claims of Mayer and Joule.
  Tyndall’s lecture was an article in ‘ Macmillan’s Magazine ’
   (August 1862), which found publicity in the peculiar society of
  “ Water Babies,” “ Sunken Rocks,” and “ Women of Italy.”
     When I <U+FB01>rst saw Prof. Tyndall’s lecture, I happened to be in
  Arran with Prof. Thomson ; and, as he had been repeatedly asked
  by the Editor of ‘ Good Words ’ to contribute a scienti<U+FB01>c article
  to its columns, we seized the opportunity of distributing among
  its 120,000 readers a corrective to the erroneous information
  which we saw was stealing upon them through the medium of
 popular journals.
     Second, as to our knowledge of what Mayer has done, which
  Prof. Tyndall allows may now be more complete than when our
  article was written. If Prof. Tyndall will refer to vol. xx. p. 262,
  of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (or to the
  Philosophical Magazine, 1852, second half-year, p. 9), where the
  paper is reprinted), he will <U+FB01>nd that so long ago as 1851 Prof.
 Thomson at least was well acquainted with Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst paper, and
 had given him the full credit that his scienti<U+FB01>c claims can possibly
  be admitted to deserve. Prof. Tyndall is most unfortunate in
 the possession of a mental bias which often prevents him (as, for
 instance, in the case of Rendu and Glacier-motion) from recog
 nizing the fact that claims of individuals whom he supposes to
 have been wronged have, before his intervention, been fully
 ventilated, discussed, and settled by the general award of
 scienti<U+FB01>c men.
     So much for our ignorance of Mayer, our putting two pens
 -to a paper instead of one, and our choice of a popular monthly
 magazine as a channel for publication.
     Does Prof. Tyndall know that Mayer’s paper has no claims to
 novelty or correctness at all, saving this, that by a lucky chance
 he got an approximation to a true result from an utterly false
 analogy; and that even on this point he had been anticipated
 by Séguin, who, three years before the appearance of Mayer’s
 paper, had obtained and published the same numerical result
 from the same hypothesis? Prof. Tyndall has quoted, without
 comment, our note on the subject. Does he recognize the truth
 of that note?    If he does not, let him expose its errors 5 and we
 shall be happy to acknowledge our mistake, and to hail the
-additions to scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge which (involving at least a
reconstruction, if not a destruction, of thermo-dynamics) must
result from Mayer’s statement if it can be shown to be true.
    As to the passage in our paper which seems to have especially
displeased Prof. Tyndall, I think it su<U+FB02>icient to make the fol
lowing remarks :
    Let Prof. Tyndall speak for himself. In his lecture he says,
“ To whom, then, are we indebted for the striking generaliza

            Prof. Tait on the Claims of Mayer and Joule.        265
tions of this evening’s discourse? All that I have laid before
you is the work of a man of whom you have scarcely ever heard.
All that I have brought before you has been taken from the
labours of a German physician named Mayer.” -Now, in that
lecture, there is little about the general principle of Conserva
tion of Energy, and we certainly never intended to hint that
 Prof. Tyndall could have meant to put forward Mayer as having
 any claims to this great generalization, although his pupil in
‘ Macmillan ’ seems to have so interpreted him. What he does
 appear to claim for Mayer is, as in fact his lecture itself shows,
 a succession of results regarding transformations of energy
 which had been elaborated by mathematicians and naturalists
 from Galileo to Davy.
     I am unwilling to enter upon matters of a more personal
 character, but it is impossible to pass over the fact that, in
 answer to an expostulation from Joule (having reference to this
 lecture), Prof. Tyndall referred (Phil. Mag. 1862, second half-year,
 p. 173) to statements he had made in a course of lectures which,
 he now tells us, were completed before he acquired those views
 of Mayer’s claims to which Joule so naturally objected, and
 that he now replies to Prof. Thomson and me, not by showing
 that his lecture, to which we referred, was free from the ob
 jections which we urged against it, but by showing that these
  objections could not be urged against a certain statement which
  he quotes from a work, not published, but promised for publi
  cation. Referring to a passage quoted from his private materials
  for this work, he makes the following remarkable statement :—
  “ If this recognition of Mr. Joule will not satisfy my critics, I
  cannot help it. It is simply a difference of estimate between
  them and me—-a difference which may exist without the least
  infraction of good faith on either side. There is nothing here
  to ‘startle’ brave men, or to give the slightest colouring of
  truth to insinuations regarding ‘depreciation’ and ‘suppres
  sion.”’    It was not this, but something very different from
  this, which startled Prof. Thomson and myself. We did not
  insinuate, but we remarked, a tendency to depreciation and
   suppression—-a tendency which no reader knowing anything of
   the history of science can fail to remark in that lecture as
   reported in the Philosophical Magazine and in the popular
  journals to which I have referred.
      I am happy to <U+FB01>nd that Prof. Tyndall now takes a view of
  one important fundamental part of the labours of our illustrious
  living countryman with which Prof. Thomson and I can cordi
  ally agree. At the same time it would be unjust to Joule to
   omit the remark that this is but a very small part of what he
  has done for the science of energy—work which includes re

XXXIX. On the Events which produced and terminated the Pur
   beck and Wealden Deposits of England and France, and on the
    Geographical Conditions of the Basin in which they were accu
    mulated.   By Snaarns V. Woon, Jun.*
                        [With a Map, Plate V.]
THE Wealden deposit of the South-east of England has, from
       the time of its being brought into prominence by Dr. Man
tell, been a fruitful subject of discussion, and has been indiffer
ently referred to as a formation produced by a lake, a river, a
delta, or an estuary, as the view of the author inclined; but the
grecise geographical conditions under which the deposit was pro
  uced have not, so far as I am aware, yet been made the subject
of a separate essay.
    In a paper read before the Geological Society in the year 1846,
upon the so-called Wealdenof Sutherlandshire-1-, Mr. A. Robertson
 entered upon a consideration of the conditions under which what
 he termed the freshwater deposits of the Portlando-Neocomian
 epoch were accumulated; and although he did not recognize
 that division between the Purbeck and Wealden which was
 afterwards established by Prof. E. Forbes, and has been since
 recognized, and refers to the same age formations that are now
 regarded as distinct, yet his views of the manner in which the
 basins containing these freshwater deposits were formed, if
 applied to the case of the principal one, that of the South-east
 of England, and if the peculiar conditions attaching to that
 area are considered, appear to offer an explanation of the phe
 nomena under which the great freshwater deposit of Portlando
 Neocomian age in England was produced.               Mr. Robertson did
 not attempt to enter upon the consideration of these condi
 tions in detail, but in general terms argues that the forma
 tions under discussion were deposited in closed basin, once

depressions of the bed of the sea of the last preceding epoch,
but by the elevation of land reduced to the condition of inland
basins, in which beds <U+FB01>rst of a brackish, and afterwards of purely
freshwater character, were accumulated, and that these, by the
subsequent depression of the area, were, in common with the
intervals of dry land which severed the basin from the sea, over
spread by the marine deposits of the succeeding epoch. I pro
pose in this paper to endeavour to show in detail the applicabi
lity of this theory, with some modi<U+FB01>cations, to the case of the
Wealden proper of the South-east of England.
    Mons. Coquand has* described the <U+FB02>uviatile beds of the two
Charente, which, containing an intermixture of <U+FB02>uviatile and
estuarine mollusca, overlie the oolite of Portlandian age, and
underlie the upper cretaceous beds in those departments, and,
following and recognizing the division established by Prof. E.
 Forbes, refers them to the age of the Purbeck rather than to
 that of the Wealden. He also derives these beds from lacustrine
conditions rather than from the operation of a delta—conditi0ns
 which he considers were produced by the elevation of the bed of
 the Portlandic sea, converting depressions in that bed into closed
 basins, much in the same manner as that suggested by Mr.
 Robertson.
     It would also seem, from the description of M. R6mer1', that
 most of the conditions which mark the Purbeck and Wealden
 respectively of England are repeated in the Purbeck-Wealden of
 Hanover.        Before entering, however, upon the discussion of the
 causes which, I conceive, produced the features exhibited by the
 Purbeck and Wealden deposits of England, there is one other
 peculiarity which the beds of the Wealden in England exhibit
 that should be noticed; and that is the occurrence, at horizons
  separated from each other by a considerable vertical thickness
 of deposit, of footprints of air-breathing animals I.              These im- ’
 pressions, it is obvious, could only have occurred upon surfaces
 left dry by receding water, and require the assumption of a con
 siderable and continuous depression of the bed of the lake in
 such a manner as to permit of a shallowness of bed (at least
 in the parts where the footprints occur) su<U+FB02>icient to allow of its
 being, by a reduction of the river supply, laid dry for an interval,
 at the same time that no such general depression of level took
 place as would admit of the sea regaining its place in the basin.
  It seems clear, from the features exhibited by modern deltas, that

270     Mr. S. V. Wood on the Events which produced and terminated
these impressions could not have thus occurred at horizons so
 (vertically) distant from each other during the progress of a
delta-deposit; while the freshwater character of the deposits
with which they are associated precludes the assumption of
their being formed on the shores of an estuary undergoing a
process of subsidence but silting up su<U+FB01>iciently fast to keep its
shores in a condition to be exposed by receding tides. Thus
it seems to me that the several phenomena which the charac
ter and grouping of the Wealden formation of England pre
sents, demand the concession of geographical conditions at once
peculiar and not to be paralleled by any known existing lake
or river, in order that such phenomena may not con<U+FB02>ict with
each other. In the Wealden we have in places a thickness
of perhaps 1400 feet, divided into at least two, if not more,
horizons considerably separated, yielding evidences of having been
at some time left dry to receive air-breathing animals, and after
wards silted over, while all these 1400 feet of deposit were accu
mulated in the immediate contiguity of the sea of the period. I
cannot <U+FB01>nd that any of the great lakes with which we are familiar
would furnish any conditions parallel to this; most of our exist
ing lakes are depressions in rocky countries, high up in the
 course of large rivers. Even the Caspian, to which Mr. Robert
 son refers for the parallel of the Wealden, furnishes no parallel;
for although that basin receives a very considerable sediment
from the large rivers which <U+FB02>ow into it, and seems to be laying
 bare the vast Aralo-Caspian deposit that surrounds it by a pro
 cess of shrinking i11 its bed, yet that inland water, having a
 closed basin preventing the out<U+FB02>ow of the water it receives,
 becomes in those parts which are distant from the embouchures
 of the rivers a brackish-water lake, harbouring a fauna which is
 not that of a purely freshwater basin. Moreover, the Caspian
 and its allied basin of the Aral, as well as the lakes of Switzer
 land and the great freshwater lakes of North America and of
 Central and Southern Africa, are situated remote from the ocean,
 while the grouping of _the synchronous marine strata of the
 South of England show that the sea was in the very closest conti
 guity to the waters which furnished the Wealden deposit. Again,
 the process under which a delta formation is accumulated is one
 which seems to preclude the occurrence of purely freshwater
 strata to a thickness such as is presented by those of the
 Wealden. The thickness of the delta of the Mississippi is given
 by Sir Charles Lyell* at about 600 feet; the boring through
 the delta of the Ganges at Calcutta1" reached, at a depth of 420
 feet, beds which appeared to indicate that the bottom of the delta

  the Purbeck and Wealden Deposits of England and France.                  271
formation was almost reached; the delta of the Rhone has been
pierced for 400 feet* ; but I am not aware that borings have
anywhere shown the existence of delta-deposits of even half the
thickness of the purely freshwater beds of the Wealden proper,
much less of the united formations of the Purbeck and Wealden;
while in almost every case the borer appears to have passed
through intercalated beds showing land-surfaces, and through
conglomerates, of which the Wealden furnishes no parallel.
    In attempting to realize the peculiar geographical con<U+FB01>gura
tion of the South-east of England during the Wealden epoch, it
will be well to refer to the grouping of the strata that surround
the Wealden deposits. The auticipations of Mr. Godwin-Austen,
in his paper “ On the possible extension of the Coal-measures
beneath the South-east of England” 1', were to a certain extent
con<U+FB01>rmed by the well-borings which took place about the same
time in the north of London and at Harwich.                  In the former,
after passing through the tertiaries, chalk with <U+FB02>ints, chalk
without <U+FB02>ints, upper greensand, and gault, to an aggregate
depth of 1113 feet, the borer reached a group of beds into
which it passed for 188 feet, and which did not appear to belong
to the lower greensand, but more probably, in the absence of
recognizable fossils, to the trias. In the latter case the borer,
after passing through tertiaries, chalk, upper greensand, and
 gault, reached a black slaty rock which, in his description of
the boring, Mr. Prestwich says can, it is almost certain, only be
 referred to one of the palaeozoic groups. The evidence afforded
 by the latter of these borings appears su<U+FB02>icient to substantiate
the production, beneath the eastern counties of England, of the
 palaeozoic axis of the Ardennes, which had been traced by borings
 to extend beneath the chalk as far west as Calais. The direction
 in which this axis is produced, however, appears to me to be
 more probably that adopted by Mr. Hulli, viz. in the direction
 of the Warwickshire and South Staffordshire coal-<U+FB01>elds, than
 in that adopted by Mr. Godwin-Austen, the direction of the coal
 measures of the West of England. The borings which have been
 made through the chalk in the Pas de Calais and Département
 du Nord §, show that the coal there, occurring beneath a thickness
 of from 260 to 600 feet of overlying upper cretaceous deposits,
 lies in a trough of carboniferous limestone and Devonian rocks
 which stretches in the form of a slight curve having its convex
 side towards the S.S.W. The production of this curve extends

  part 7which would be between Folkestone and Maidstone, with
  the‘ chalk escarpment of the Weald Valley between those places.
   I The sym metrical ‘form of the Weald Valley is interrupted at
  Maidstone——the axis of the elevation, which proceeds due east
  and west from the borders of Hampshire through Surrey and
  West Kent, being de<U+FB02>ected at this point to the E.S.E., a direc
  tion that it maintains until the tumescence is lost inland of
  Boulogne. Now in the production of_ this palaeozoic axis, which,
  bending northwards in the centre of‘the Pas‘ de Calais, assumes
 in stretching to the Straits of Dover at Cape Grisnez the direction
 of E.S."E.', _we have presented to usa very apparent cause for the
 sudden de<U+FB02>ection of the Weald anticlinal from its normal direc
 tion. The presence of a “ massif” of highly indurated palmozoic
 rock, with its planes of strati<U+FB01>cation arranged at angles uncon
 formable to the beds of mesozoic age abutting up to it, could
 not, I conceive, fail to affect the upthrow of the beds subjected
 to the elevatory action, producing the anticlinal by a tendency to
 divert the line of upthrow into the direction of that of the ancient
 “massif.” The action to which I refer has, I imagine, operated in
 all countries in interfering with the lines of strike, the symme
 trical direction of these lines being at points diverted or inter
 fered with without any apparent cause*. By a reference to the
 chart annexed to the paper of MM. Degoussée and Laurent'|', it
 will be found that the line of the carboniferous trough there in
 dicated intersects, if produced under the chalk of Kent, the line
 of the anticlinal of the Weald Valley about Cranbrook in Kent.
 Now Cranbrook is - the point at which the Weald anticlinal
 abruptly changes its direction of E. 5° N., W. 5° S.; to that of
 E. 25° S., W. 25° N., which is that of the carboniferous axis
 disclosed by the‘ coal-borings of the two French departments.

much that might be adduced to show that the irregularity in direction of
mountain-chains is proportional to the presence in them of “ massifs ” of
older rocks which have been thrown into anticlinals of an origin anterior to
the principal one of the system, and hence that the regularity of mountain
chains is (in Europe at least, which has undergone sogrcat disturbance in
every age) proportional also to the age of the system; the more ancient the
system, the more re ular its direction, if free from later disturbances.

   The drainage through Essex and Suffolk possesses a direction
imparted to it by valleys which have rolled off, as it were, from
the axis of the Weald upheaval, or been scooped out along lines
of fracture connected with that upheaval. The valley of the
Thames from Barking to Gravesend, which, after an interruption
between that place and Chatham, is continued behind the Isle of
Sheppey, departs but little from the line of the chalk escarpment

the south-west. The rivers of East Suffolk (the Orwell, Deben,
and Alde) preserve this direction throughout their courses.
The valleys, which in South Essex are parallel with the Weald,
lose, like the rivers, that parallelism towards the north of the
county; and the eretaceous and tertiary deposits in like manner
change, although obscurely, the direction of their strike into one
more and more oblique to the Weald axis, until in West Norfolk
the strike of the lower chalk is north and south, changing this di
rection towards the east gradually, so that in East Norfolkthe strike
of the upper beds becomes N.W. to S.E., like that of the river
valleys of East Suffolk. On the other hand, at the extreme west of
Norfolk the strike of the lower eretaceous and oolitic formations
inclines from the north and south line in the opposite direction,
viz. from N. by E.to S. byW., and towards that of the old Jurassic
strike in this particular region—the Great Ouse following up to
Shelford in Bedfordshire the Jurassic strike along the line of what
I am about presently to refer to as the north-east opening of the
mesozoic gulf, while the Waveney from Diss to the sea not
improbably follows the outline of the north-western shore of the
palaeozoic barrier. I associate this gradual curving of the strike
with the existence of the palaeozoic barrier beneath it, and infer
that the latter has made its presence felt in the counties of Essex
and Suffolk by modifying the upthrow of the beds overlying it
at the time of the Weald upheaval, not less than it has in East
ern Kent and Sussex, and in the portion of France opposite to
those counties, by resisting the pressure of the less indurated
beds of mesozoic origin there abutting up to it, and which in
the upthrow were forced against it.

274      Mr. S.V.Wood on the Events whichproduced and terminated
rations arrived, of the extension of this palaeozoic barrier from
the VVarwickshire coal-<U+FB01>eld in an E.S.E. direction, appears to me
therefore to obtain some con<U+FB01>rmation from the interruptions in,
or departure from, the normal direction of the anticlinal and syn
clinal lines produced by the Weald upheaval. If these conjec
tures have any su<U+FB02>icient foundation, the con<U+FB01>guration of the
east of England would, if the cretaceous and tertiary covering
were removed, show very similar features to the west, where the
palaeozoic area curves northwards along the valley of the Severn
-—both the eastern and western palaeozoic areas being separated
from the Penine chain by straits, the severance of the two areas
having been caused by the upheaval of that chain *. If the direc
tion of this ancient barrier be correctly inferred, we have the
following succession of geographical con<U+FB01>guration over the south
east of England and north-west of France.
    During the mesozoic period, up to the newer cretaceous epoch,
a basin existed, bounded on the north-east by this barrier, on
the north by the southern extremity of the Penine chain, on the
north-west by the Silurian system of Wales and Shropshire, on
the west and south-west by the carboniferous systems of South
Wales and North Devon and the ancient rocks of Brittany, and
 to the south-east by the crystalline plateau of Central France.
At the earlier part of this period, when the stage of greatest
depression in most parts of it occurred, viz. during the Triassic
age, the basin existed in the form of a strait connecting the
 Triassic .sea of Germany with the Triassic waters of the north of
Ireland on the one side, and those of the north-east of England
on the other. At the commencement of the Jurassic age, how
 ever, when great changes of level had taken place, converting
 great parts ofthe Triassic sea of Germany into land, the Anglo
 Frankish basin had become considerably modi<U+FB01>ed. At this epoch
the basin had four openings: one in Cheshire, forming the
north-western opening and probably extending in a narrow
    ’* The tract of which these palaeozoic areas once formed part, appears to
 have been one of those axes to which I have elsewhere (Phil. Mag. 1862,
 vol. xxiii. p. 164) adverted as having come into existence during the carboni
 ferousage in various parts of the world, with a direction generally east and
 west, marking the direction of the lines of volcanic action during that period.
 This axis, although now exposed only in fragments, appears to have been
 originally of great extent—the portion which extends from the west of Ire
 land to the east of Germany being probably connected on the east with a
 similar axis said by M. Abich to extend through Southern Russia, and on
the west with the axis of Newfoundland. The upheaval of the Penine
 chain destroyed the continuity of that portion of the axis which crossed the
 British Isles; and its consequent and contiguous depressions formed the
 northern head and north-eastern and north-western openings of a basin
 that <U+FB01>rst, with a portion of the north-eastern opening probably as land,
received the Permian sea, and afterwards, with that opening at its greatest
 suhmergence, the sea of the True.

channel north-westwards between Scotland and Ireland ; another
in Northamptonshire and the counties immediately south-east
of it, forming the north-eastern opening; a-third to the south
east in the department of the Cote d’Or, communicating with
the Jurassic sea of the Jura and Alps; and the fourth in the
south-west, forming a strait communicating with the Jurassic
basin of the Charentes and Pyrenees. Of these openings, that to
the south-east is considered by M. Elie de Beaumont to have
closed after the termination of the Stones<U+FB01>eld oolite*; that to
the north-west, Mr. Hull1', from a consideration of the manner
in which the sediment of the Jurassic deposits of the central
counties of England that are older than the upper zone of the great
oolite has been accumulated, regards as having closed about the
same epoch. The opening to the south-west would appear, from
the grouping of the Jurassic beds of the region, to have closed
also during the age of the great oolite ; but the position of the
basin of the Charentes and Pyrenees, the presence in the Cha
rentes of the Portland limestone, and of a formation identical
with the English Purbecks, coupled with the absence there of
the older cretaceous deposits, induce me to suppose that a strait
continued open, joining the Anglo-Frankish basin to that of the
Charentes, until the close of the Purbeck epoch. The absence of
the lower cretaceous deposits in the Charentes basin, when taken
in connexion with the effects produced there by the upheaval of
the Pyrenees, points to the conclusion that the only access of this
depression to the sea was through a strait communicating with
the Anglo-Frankish basin, which, when elevated, converted that
of the Charente into land, or into a freshwater lake, until the up
heaval of the Pyrenees, breaking up the barrier Atlantic-wards,
gave the sea entrance to that basin from the west. That infer
ence will derive much support if it should prove, as contended
by M. Coquand, that lower cretaceous formations do not exist, as
hitherto supposed, in the Pyrenees, and consequently not in any
part of the Charento-Pyrenean depression.                                .
     By the close of the Portland oolite and sand formation, the
 only opening remaining unclosed, except the Charente Strait,
was that to the north-east; and if the assumption that the
Charente basin opened only into the Anglo-Frankish one be
    * The presence of cretaceous beds in the departments of the Doubs and
 Jura conformable to the Jurassic, mentioned by M. Benoit and others, does
 not prove that the upheaval of the Cote d’Or system of M. de Beaumont
 took place at a later period than that assigned to it by M. de Beaumont,
 but only that the upheaval of the system was of less extent than he consi
 dered it, and was distinct from the subsequent upheaval of the Jura and
 part of the Cote d’Or during the cretaceous epoch, an upheaval posessing
 a direction more east and west than the former, and crossing it at acute
 angles. See Benoit, Bull. vol. xv. p. 316.

276     Mr. S.V.Wood on the Events whichproduced and terminated
correct, then both basins received the sea-water through the
opening at the north-eastern extremity lying in or near the
counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire;
but if that assumption be untenable, then we have the Anglo
Frankish basin at least land-locked, except at its north-eastern
extremity, where alone it communicated with the sea. Now it
is apparent from the grouping of the oolitic deposits in the form
of concentric rings round the basin, that the closing of the north
western and south-eastern openings was due to that elevatory
action which, commencing at the close of the Triassic age, con
 tinued with comparatively slight and partial oscillations of level
 throughout the Jurassic. The last effect of that continuous ele
 vation would be the closing of the strait which joined the English
basin to the sea, and the conversion of the basin (and with it
that of the Charentes) into one receiving fresh water’ only.
 Whether the closing of the Charente strait preceded the closing
 of that in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, or the reverse,
 will depend on the parallelism that may be established between
the Portlandian of the Charentes (upon which the gypsiferous_
marls of the Purbeck repose) and the Portlandian of Dorset ;
but the effect on the basins would in either case be the same in
appearance, although in the former case the Purbeck formations
of the two depressions would not be exactly synchronous, as the
 Charente basin would have been converted into one of brackish
water before the English depression was severed from the sea,
while in the latter the conversion of the English basin into one of
brackish water would involve the similar conversion of that of the
 Charentcs, which communicated with the sea through the English
basin alone. No traces of the Wealden exist in the Charento
Pyrenean basin, so far as that basin is exposed; but it is not
improbable that towards the more central portions of it, hidden
by the overlying cretaceous and tertiary deposits, beds synchro
nous with the Wealden proper of England, and, like it, of purely
freshwater origin, may exist. The greater distance of this basin
from the principal line of depression (which, as I shall attempt
to show, produced the peculiar conditions of the English basin
from the Wealden to the commencement of the upper creta
ceous epoch) renders it probable that it underwent a less
amount of depression during the Wealden epoch than did the
neighbouring basin of England (and this is to a certain extent
con<U+FB01>rmed by the absence in the Charentes of any lower creta
ceous deposits) ; so that it would be inconsistent to <U+FB01>nd any purely
freshwater deposit extending to the edges of the basin ; and these
edges are the only parts of it not covered up by newer deposits.
    It thus appears to me that in this climax of the elevatory
action of the Jurassic age, we have the clue to the con<U+FB01>guration

 the Purbeck and Wealden Deposits ofEngland and France.               277
which brought into existence deposits, <U+FB01>rst of brackish, and then
of freshwater origin, of great thickness, in the immediate neigh
bourhood of the sea, that do not present any of the characters
which mark deltas properly so called. In the basin thus isolated,
we may easily conceive that deposits of limited thickness and of
brackish-water character would accumulate during that interval
in which the isolation was imperfect but progressing, and while
the land was becoming stationary. The thickness of the Purbeck
of England varies, according to the sections of the Geological Sur
vey, between ISO and 380 feet. That of the Purbeck of the Cha
rente is much inferior,»being, according to M. Coquand, from 160
to 180 feet, a difference that would tend to show that the com
plete isolation of the latter basin preceded that of the former. In
both, however, the amount of sediment is very small compared
with that forming the Wealden, and not more than a river of
moderate dimensions would furnish to a gradually shoaling basin.
    It remains now to consider what were the conditions under
which, in the English basin, a depression ensued that permitted
the continuous accumulation of the far greater amount of sedi
ment during the Wealden epoch, and under purely <U+FB02>uviatile
conditions, before the ocean re-entered the basin. In doing so,
it will be useful <U+FB01>rst to consider what is the thickness of the
beds in the South of England lying between the Portland sand
and the lower beds of the upper cretaceous group.
    The relative thickness of the Wealden beds at different points
of their exposure is uncertain. At the western end of the Isle
of Purbeck the section exposed is imperfect, through a fault
occurring there; at Swanage Bay and in the Isle of Wight the
lowest beds are not exposed; while in the Weald of Kent a
similar di<U+FB02>iculty exists, until it be determined whether the Ash
burnham beds really belong to it or to the Purbeck. The
exposed beds of the Wealden section at Swanage Bay, from a
measurement furnished me by Mr. Jenkins of the Geological
Society, show a thickness of about 1000 feet; and the unex
posed portion at the same spot would, assuming the same dip to
continue, give from 400 to 500 more. At the west of the Isle
of Purbeck, the sections of the Geological Survey would
appear to show considerably less than this, but the fault between
the Wealden and Purbeck renders the thickness uncertain. Mr.
Drew gives the entire thickness in Kent and Sussex, exclusive
of the Ashburnham beds, at about 1200 feet*. So far as we can

278      Mr. S.V. Wood on the Events whichproduced and terminated
judge, therefore, the thickness seems to vary from about 1200
feet at its eastern edge, to nearly 1500 at its more central por
tion. We should expect to <U+FB01>nd the greatest thickness towards
the centre of the basin, where the most sediment would be swept
by the current; and in the case of the overlying marine deposit
of the lower greensand, that is conspicuously the case. The
sections of Mr. Simms* show the lower greensand at Hythe as
having a thickness of 405 feet ; and those of Dr. Fitton1' at
Ather<U+FB01>eld give 805 feet, being nearly double that at Hythe.
Ather<U+FB01>eld is placed about the central part of the gulf, while
Hythe is, as I conceive, close to the palaeozoic barrier that, until
the upper cretaceous epoch, shut in the basinjlj.
     The sum of the thickness of the deposits, from the base of the
Wealden to the base of the upper cretaceous (which are absent
at Harwich), would amount to about 2000 feet; and in the Pas
de Calais and Département du Nord it would be more than
this.     We thus see that the shore of the Wealden lake was,
after the close of the Purbeck epoch, skirted by a range of hills
attaining a height of about 2000 feet above the bottom of the
lake; and if, as we are compelled to do by the succession of
 footprint horizons, we consider the lake as shallow enough,
 during a considerable part of its existence, to be laid dry along
 its Sussex margin at intervals, then the greater part of that
 elevation would at the time referred to be above the surface of
 the lake. To what height above the sea the elevation of the
 ground in the region of the north-east opening extended, which,
 shutting out the sea, converted the basin into a lake, we have no
 means of forming any approximation. If the depression pro
 ceeded at an equal rate in the region of the north-east opening.
 that is, in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, with what it did
 over the rest of the palzeozoic barrier, we might, by comparing the
 thickness of any lower greensand beds present in those counties
 with that of the similar deposit in Kent and Surrey, estimate
 the elevation above the sea, of the land closing the north-east
 opening, by deducting the thickness of the lower greensand in
 the two latter counties from the thickness in the two <U+FB01>rst

    I A somewhat similar proportion between the northern and more cen
 tral parts of the basin is exhibited in the relative thicknesses of the lower
 greensand in the Haute Marne and in the Aube—that in the former being
 about 280 feet, and that in the latter about 470. See Cornuel, in Mém.
 Geol. Soc. France, vol. -iv.; and Leymerie, in the same. Both the Haute

basin lying in the South of England.

named. But this approximation would be very uncertain, for
two reasons: one, because the depression was not, as I am about
to attempt to show, equal over the two areas; and the other,‘
because the <U+FB02>ux and re<U+FB02>ux of water through the strait during
the formation of the lower greensand of Hampshire would impede
the depoit of sediment in the strait itself, and carry it into the
more open portions of the basin.
    It is evident that the depression, of which the commencement
marks the point when the elevatory movements of the oolitic age
terminated and the cretaceous movements of subsidence began,
had its focus upon the north-eastern sides of the Anglo-Frankish
basin, and that its effects were for a considerable lapse of time
con<U+FB01>ned to that part of the basin. The lower greensand deposits
that overlie the Wealden in the Isle of Wight to the thickness
of 800 feet, and in Kent along the border of the palaeozoic barrier
to a thickness of 400 feet, are, it is well known, either absent in
Dorsetshire, or exist in an attenuated form like the bed occur
ring at the top of the \Vealden at Pun<U+FB01>eld in Swanage Bay,
referred to by Mr. Godwin-Austen ; so that by the close of the
lower cretaceous age the palaeozoic barrier had sunk to the same
level as the opposite shore of the basin in Dorsetshire, where
the upper cretaceous overlie alike the oolite and the Wealden,
being a subsidence of some 1500 feet in excess of the one region
over the other during the lower cretaceous epoch. A similar
effect is to be observed in the French portion of the basin. M.
Triger, in his description of the cretaceous deposits of La Sarthe*,
shows that as we advance southwards towards the edge of the
basin, the lower beds of cretaceous age disappear, and the creta
ceous beds covering the Jurassic formations become successively
newer and newer,—the lower greensand, which at Cape la Heve
reposes on the Jurassic, being at Hon<U+FB02>eur replaced by the gault,
which reposes there on the Kimmeridge clay; while more south
wards, in the department of La Sarthe itself, the upper greensand
or the chalk marl is the deposit which reposes on the oolitic
formations; so that the depression which permitted the sea
during the cretaceous age to reoccupy the oolitic basin, palpably
diminished in amount as the distance from the line of the oolitic
barrier increased.
    In Norfolk, according to Mr. Rose'I', the beds which repre
 sent the chalk marl and lower and middle chalk attain a thick
 ness at Norwich of 1150 feet, while, according to the same
 authority, the lower greensand at its outcrop some 40 miles
‘west from Norwich has a thickness of only from '70 to 90
 feet. This circumstance appears to show the effect of the <U+FB02>ux

280      Mr. S. V. Wood on the Events whichproduced and terminated
and re<U+FB02>ux of the tide through the north-east opening during
the formation of the lower greensand in impeding the accumu
lation of sediment ; for if my views are well founded, the sea, after
the close of the lower greensand deposit, found its way through
various parts of the barrier then changing into the condition of
 a cluster of islands, so that the <U+FB02>ux and re<U+FB02>ux in the region of
the old strait became less and less, until a deep-water condition
 was attained permitting the accumulation of this great thick
 ness of chalk. Again, according to the same authority, at a
 distance of only twenty miles south of Norwich, at Diss, where,
if my delineation of it be tenable, the north-western shore of the
palaeozoic barrier was near, and the water consequently shallower,
the chalk has a thickness of only 500 feet. A much less thick
ness than that at Norwich appears to prevail pretty generally
over the region of the barrier, except that at Harwich it rises
to 880 feet; while in the Isle of Wight, over the central part of
the old basin, and therefore in a deep part, the greatest thick
ness of any is found*. The increased thickness on the borders
of Essex and Herts and in Sussex corresponds with the edges
of the barrier being there passed1'.
    The presence of the upper greensand overlying gault in Nor
folk and Essex as well as in Kent and Sussex, although very
attenuated in the <U+FB01>rst county, shows that the diminished thick
ness of the chalk in the parts where such diminution is observed
is not due to those parts undergoing submersion at a later stage
of the chalk than others. Yet we may infer that the shallower
condition of the water over the barrier impeded the accumula
tion of sediment there, a result to which perhaps some islands
still remaining above water during the deposit of the upper
greensand and of the earlier part of the chalk may have contri
buted by inducing currents between them.
    It is worthy of remark, also, how the mineralogical character
of the eretaceous deposits around and over the palaeozoic barrier
mark the successive stages of the depression which prevailed
through that age, until the close of the middle chalk or chalk
with <U+FB02>ints. While the basin was a quiescent inlet, the sediment
swept into it was of an arenaceous character, more or less inter

   1' Mr. Prestwich (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. viii. p. 256) attributes the
varying thickness of the chalk to denudation anterior to the deposit of the
lower tertiaries, and shows that from this cause the chalk over the North
Downs has in places been reduced to the lower beds only, and to a thick
ness of 400 feet; and this agrees with the views above, as, the region of
the Weald being beyond the barrier, the deeper-water conditions pre
vailed, permitting a free accumulation of sediment that is now in places
extensively removed. The varying thickness of the chalk in many places
over the barrier cannot, however, be explained by denudation.

earlier period of the lower greensand formation, with argillaceous
material ; but at the point when the palaeozoic barrier reached the
water’s edge, forming an extensive reef rising in parts into islands,
the degradation of such shale as that brought up by the borer at
Harwich, taking place over an extensively shallow area, furnished
the dark aluminous silt that forms so marked a feature in the
gault of the South-east of England, and was deposited over and
around that barrier. As the depression proceeded uninterruptedly,
the stages of sand, marl, and pure chalk successively occur over
the region, marking the increasing stages of depth until some
thing approaching to oceanic depth was reached, when the <U+FB02>int
layers grew.
    In the paper before referred to, I attempted to show that the
geological movements of the mesozoic period, up to the end of
the oolitic age, were due to several great systems or hands of
volcanic action in di<U+FB02>erent parts of the earth, which possessed a
direction coinciding more or less with the meridians of longitude,
the effect of which was to produce a trend of the land generally
from north to south; and that it was to one of these bands,
which I -designated as the system of Portugal prolonged into
England, that the continuous elevation of the Jurassic gulfs
of England and France, which lay on the eastern side of the
band, was due. I also pointed out that the period of depres
sion which succeeded this commenced (in Europe at least)
during the lower cretaceous epoch, and was marked by a total
change in the direction of the volcanic action from the direction
of north to south which had prevailed since the commencement
of the Permian age, to one from west to cast, a direction which
indicated, with very few exceptions, the prevalent one of all systems
originating since the lower cretaceous epoch. The commence
ment of this total change I regarded as marked by the formation
of the system of the principal part of the Pyrenees, which,
according to M. d’Archiac, originated towards the close of the
lower cretaceous epoch*. Now the mode in which the subsi
dence of theAnglo-Frankish basin took place during the formation
of the Wealden deposit, seems to me well to illustrate some of
the elfects which this total change in the direction of the volcanic
action produced. Thus, while the elevatory action of the oolitic
age over the north-west of Europe was due to a line of volcanic
action of which the direction may be indicated by the seventh
meridian of longitude, extending from the Portuguese frontier to
   " If M. Coquand’s view, that the lower cretaceous deposits are absent in
the Pyrenees equally as in the Charentes, be correct, it would seem that the
origin of the Pyrenean system must be advanced to a later part of the cre
taceous age than that assigned to it by M. d’Archiac.

282     Mr. S. V.Wo0d an the Events whichproduced and terminated
Skye, the direction of the line of subsidence which prevailed
over the same area through the cretaceous age, until the great
continental upheaval commenced at the epoch of the Maestricht
chalk, is indicated by the parallel drawn almost at right angles
to the former line, and extending from Dorsetshire to Valen
ciennes, coinciding in direction precisely with that of the axis
of cretaceous elevation in the Pyrenees, to which it may be
regarded as the complementary line of depression. We also see
that this subsidence was at its maximum over the line of the old
palaeozoic barrier, with whose anticlinal it very nearly coincided,
and that it sensibly diminished as the distance from that line
increased; while along the line of Jurassic elevation neither sub
sidence nor elevation took place, the volcanic action of that band
having become extinct at the close of the oolitic period, and the
movements of the band theretofore affected by it having conse
quently terminated. We thus perceive how the ocean, kept out of
the Wealden basin during the progress of that formation, did
not, when the subsidence of the barrier permitted it to re-enter,
over<U+FB02>ow the outcrop of the upper oolites surrounding the basin
an over<U+FB02>ow which never more than partially took place, and that
not until the barrier had been submerged su<U+FB01>iciently to receive
the deposits of the gault and upper greensand over it. By the
close of the epoch of the chalkwith <U+FB02>ints this barrier had undergone
a depression from its condition at the close of the Purbeck epoch
of little less than 3000 feet. The maximum of depression varied
over the line itself during the earlier portion of the lower creta
ceous age, since, while a depression ensued at that time in
Dorsetshire sufficient to deposit a great thickness of Wealden
formation over the Purbeck, no further depression of any mag
nitude ensued at that extremity of the line until the upper
greensand epoch. From the concentration of the action of
subsidence in different parts of the barrier at different stages
of the cretaceous age which appears to have taken place, and
particularly from the chief concentration appearing to have
occurred in the part between London and Valenciennes, it
does not seem necessary to infer any very considerable elevation
of the bed of the north-east strait during the progress of the
Wealden deposit. In Oxfordshire, across the south of which
county I place the northern margin of the lake, and near which, in
the adjoining counties of Buckingham and Bedford, I place the
north-east opening, the lower greensand underlying the upper
cretaceous deposits occurs, according to Prof. J. Phillips*, in a
very attenuated form, showing, unless the <U+FB02>ow of the tide pre
vented the accumulation of sediment, how little depression that
extremity of the barrier underwent during the lower cretaceous

age. The existence of the north-east opening during the oolitic
age, in the form of a strait not caused by any abrupt dislocation
of the land surrounding the basin to which it gave access, fur
nishes presumptive evidence that the bed of it was shallow and
capable of being converted into land by a very moderate eleva
tion, resembling in this respect the Sound entrance to the Baltic
at the present day. The absence of all appearance of convul
sive movement in that region at the close of the oolitic age would
also show that the opening became converted into land by merely
participating in the general elevation which so uninterruptedly
marked that age until its close, becoming by the process a low
lying tract. The apparent discrepancy, that this low-lying tract
should not have been submerged while the rest of the palaeozoic
barrier and more central part of the basin were undergoing a
 depression of some 1200 or 1400 feet, is removed by the proofs
 which exist that the extremity of the barrier which abutted
 on the midland counties did not undergo any material depres
 sion until the upper cretaceous age, and that even during that
 age it marked the north-westernmost limit of the depression
 then proceeding.
     In realizing, therefore, the process of depression which marked
 the formation of the Wealden, we have to conceive the depres
 sion taking place along the line from Dorsetshire to Valenciennes
 to have been at its maximum over the palaeozoic barrier, diminish
 ing in amount at the western extremity of the line, and losing
  its force as the distance southwards from the line increased ; so
  that by the time the central part of that line had subsided to the
  extent of 1200 feet and upwards, the low-lying land of the_north
  east opening was again submerged to an extent probably only
  sufficient to permit the ingress of the sea-water to the basin,
  and not of the deposit of any thickness of sediment over the
  opening itself. On the sea re-entering, it would be only the
  most depressed area that would be occupied by it, those portions
  of the basin lying west and south of the line of depression
  remaining land until the continuance of the process of depression
  or attenuation brought them successively below the sea-level.
   Hence the absence of lower cretaceous marine deposits in Dor
  setshire, and hence the successive thinning out of the lower
  cretaceous deposits through the departments of Calvados, Orne,
   and Sarthe. Into the deeper or more central portions of a land
   locked gulf the greater quantity of sediment would be swept;
   and hence the maximum thickness of the lower greensand occurs
   at Ather<U+FB01>eld, diminishing north-eastwards towards the palaeozoic
   barrier, and disappearing or thinning out westwards in Dorset
   shire, and southwards in the Calvados.
      The whole grouping of the Purbeck formation would have

284    Mr. S. V.Wood on the Events which produced and terminated
pointed to a truly delta origin in the absence of the peculiar
geographical conditions affecting it in common with theWealden ;
but the stage at which the elevatory movements of the oolitic
age terminated and converted the marine gulf into an inland
basin, concurs with the formation of this deposit. As Mr.
Robertson in the paper before quoted showed, the earlier
deposits of a basin recently severed from the ocean would be
those of brackish water ; but this brackish condition could
scarcely have endured, under the in<U+FB02>uence of the passage of
fresh water through it, long enough for the accumulation of 300
feet of sediment. The brackish condition of the Caspian and
its allied basins, and of some other lakes, is due to their being
closed basins, where the evaporation balances or exceeds the
supply of fresh water, so that the salts washed from the soil and
held in solution in imperceptible quantities in the river-water
gradually accumulate. Where this is not the case, the basin has
an outlet and the waters are fresh. We can scarcely conceive
the conditions of the basin as regards river-supply and evapora
tion to have been so different during the Purbeck epoch, to what
was the case during the Wealden, as to allow us to seek an
explanation of the brackish-water condition of the basin during
the former epoch by assuming that it was a closed one where
evaporation equalled the precipitation.         We must rather infer
that during this epoch channels through the north-east open
ing permitted the access of the tide, and thus made brackish
the waters, and that the <U+FB01>nal movements which terminated the
oolitic age rendered the fall of these channels too great for the
tide during the succeeding age to reach the basin.
   Of the many formations of oolito-neocomian age containing
freshwater mollusca, either solely or intermixed with estuary
forms, a few only would, if the foregoing conclusions are well
founded, be common to the same basin with the VVealden of
England. Of these, the ferruginous sands of Shotover near
Oxford, shown by Prof. J. Phillips* to repose at Coombe Wood
and Garsington in Oxfordshire, and in parts of Buckinghamshire
and Bedfordshire, on beds referable to the Purbeck, seem alone
to be unequivocally referable to the deposits formed in the basin
during the Wealden epoch; but the underlying brackish-water
beds in these counties, and the brackish-water beds in the Bas
Boulonnais, appear clearly to be parts of the earlier deposits of
the same basin, and synchronous with the Purbeck deposits of
Dorset and Wilts. The unfossiliferous sands and marls of small
thickness containing slight vegetable impressions, described by
M. Cornuel as occurring in the Haute Marne, between the lower
greensand beds and the Portland limestone, and regarded by

 the Purbeck and Wealden Deposits of England and France.         285
Dr. Fitton as of Purbeck or Wealden age, undoubtedly belong
to the Anglo-Frankish basin ; but whether they are to be referred
to the Purbeck or to the Wealden, or to neither, but to the over
lying or underlying marine formations, is a matter of much
doubt; at least we may a<U+FB01>irm that, if they are eventually re
ferred either to the Purbeck or Wealden, they formed the ex
treme s0uth~easternm0st margin of the lake.           The other <U+FB02>u
viatile formations of oolitic age, viz. those of the Hautes Alpes, of
 Skye, of Sutherlandshire, and of Lincolnshire, have no geogra
phical relation to the formations occurring in the South-east of
England, or, except those of Skye and Sutherlandshire, with
 each other. The great Purbeck-Wealden formation of Hanover,
 although most probably synchronous with the similar formations
 of the South-east of England, was manifestly geographically se
 vered from them by the palaaozoic barrier. On the other hand, .
 the <U+FB02>uviatile deposits of Beauvais, and those described by M.
 Coquand as occurring in the Isle of Aix, belong to a later geolo
 gical horizon, and have no connexion either geographically or
 geologically with the <U+FB02>uviatile formations discussed in this paper.
    It follows also, from the conclusions here drawn, that the
 marine equivalent of the Wealden (the lower Neocomian of the
 Southeast of France) should occur in the north-eastern counties
 of England beyond the north-east opening, being necessarily
 absent over that area which the Anglo-Frankish basin occupied
 during the progress of the Wealden deposit. In these counties
 and in Western Norfolk, however, the contiguity of the shore may
 have rendered the water too shoal to permit of the deposit of
 any older cretaceous formations approaching in thickness to the
 lower greensand of the basin itself, and in West Norfolk the
 action of the tide setting in towards the opening may have
  tended to check the accumulation of sediment.
     In considering the sources and direction from which came
  the waters that fed the basin with sediment during the Wealden
  epoch, we have to consider the nature of this sediment, and the
  character during the time of its deposit -of the land which sur
  rounded the basin.    As to the <U+FB01>rst, those who have made the
  Wealden their study appear agreed that the source of the sedi
  ment was chie<U+FB02>y an area of metamorphic rocks. The absence
  or rarity of limestone in the beds of the Wealden itself is one
  of its most marked features ; but this absence may not be alto
  gether due to the drainage-area being destitute of limestone
  tracts; the soluble nature of lime permits of its being carried
  into the sea, and held there in suspension after all the alumi
  nous and siliceous sediment has been deposited. The rarity of
  limestone cannot, therefore, I think be adduced as an argument
  that the Wealden waters were derived from an area in which the

286     Mr. S. V. Wood on the Events which produced and terminated
presence of limestone formations was the exception. The beds
of the Wealden, however, are of a highly argillaceous character
throughout, the extensive sand-beds among them being rarely
free from a considerable intermixture of aluminous particles, as
the wet and intractable soil of nearly the whole WVealden area
attests. It is therefore not unreasonable to infer that districts
ebounding in metamorphic rocks formed the larger portion of
the area from which the waters that furnished the Wealden
sediment were collected. There are no such areas from which
we could derive these waters at all comparable in magnitude with
those surrounding the western part of the English Channel, or
the shores of the St. George’s Channel, both of which channels
are formed by depressions dating back into the palaeozoic period,
and consequently existing as valleys of drainage during the
Wealden epoch.
    To estimate the lay or inclination of the land surrounding the
Wealden basin during the progress of that formation, itis neces
'sary to eliminate from the features which that land now presents
the effects that have been produced by the great tertiary anti
clinals of the South-east of England. Anterior to the formation
of these anticlinals the South-east of England remained, until the
close of the Wealden formation, a basin more or less landlocked;
and after the eastern barrier had become submerged, and during
the upper cretaceous age, it formed the site of a deep bay or
 gulf, after which, with an interval of dry land between the
 secondary and tertiary periods, it remained an open gulf,
 although diminished in extent, until the age of the crag. The
 anticlinals, in converting this sea-bed into elevated land, reversed
 the inclination that the area of the British Channel possessed
 during the entire mesozoic period. The extent of this reversal
 is to be measured by the amount of elevation which the sea-bed
 has undergone where these anticlinals occur. The amount of
 this is probably not less than 4500 feet *, and has a<U+FB02>°ected
 the whole of England east of a line joining Dorsetshire and the
 Norfolk coast. Although this fact is so well understood, I enlarge
 upon it here to show how great must have been the effect of these
 anticlinals in modifying the inclination which, previously to the
 upheaval taking place, the land of the South-west of England
 possessed. The whole of the British Channel east of Dorsetshire

has been made by it, and that west of Dorsetshire has been
submerged, and its inclination (which was eastward towards the
shore of the mesozoic basin) reversed, so that the water of the
British Channel now deepens as we go westwards.
    The area of Portugal, which during the secondary period up
to the cretaceous age was a<U+FB02>ected by a line of volcanic upheaval
running north and south, is, with the exception of the mesozoic
deposits accumulated on its western <U+FB02>ank, one of metamorphic
rocks, these rocks extending through the Spanish province of
Galicia to the Atlantic and to the Bay of Biscay.
    This area was, I conceive, during the oolitic period joined to
that of the British Isles and under the elevatory in<U+FB02>uence of that
line of volcanic action to which I have before referred as the
system of Portugal prolonged into England. The junction was
probably severed by the western depression correlative to the
upheaval of the Pyrenees, partly during the eretaceous, and
partly during the older tertiary epochs. The extent of the cor
relative depression may be inferred from the extent to which the
eretaceous and older tertiary sea-bed of the Pyrenees has been
elevated by the upheaval of that chain. If we in imagination
restore the junction of the metamorphic system of Portugal with
Finisterre and the west of England, and eliminate from the pro
blem the western depressions complementary to the tertiary
anticlinals of the South-east of England, and the eretaceous and
tertiary anticlinals of the Pyrenees, we shall have little di<U+FB02>iculty
in restoring the areas of the St. George’s Channel and of the
English Channel west of Dorsetshire as great valleys—the former
opening into the latter, and the latter opening into the meso
zoic basin between Dorsetshire and the mouth of the Seine.
These great valleys opening thus, and surrounded as they are,
 chie<U+FB02>y by lower Silurian formations in which limestone is the
 exception, or by Devonian or Silurian formations in a more or
 less metamorphic condition, appear, without speculating on the
 now submerged formations lying between Portugal and the
 British Isles, to offer the most probable valleys of drainage from
whence came the waters which furnished theWealden sediment.
 Assuming, however, that this was so, we may nevertheless
 admit that many subordinate valleys of drainage surrounding
 the basin contributed to furnish the sediment. But the chief
 mass of the sediment being accumulated in the region where a
  river emptying itself through this valley would discharge into
 the basin, points to that as the principal source of the supply.
     In parting with the subject, I cannot refrain from advancing
 the conjecture that the Jurassic basin of the Charentes, in which
  such similar phenomena occur as are present in the Jurassic
  basin of England and France, was governed by geographical

288 On the Purbeck and Wealden Deposits ofEngland and France.
conditions not dissimilar to those of the latter basin, that is, that
during the Jurassic age it was a basin becoming more and more
landlocked with each successive epoch, under the elevatory
in<U+FB02>uence of the system of Portugal and England, on the eastern
<U+FB02>ank of which, like the Anglo-Frankish basin, it existed, until
at the close of the Jurassic age it ceased for a long interval to be
a marine basin, all connexion between it and the ocean being
severed by the elevation, at the close of the Purbeck epoch, of
the strait communicating with the basin of England and France.
After the lapse of this long interval, when the sea during the
upper cretaceous age occupied both basins, there appears no
reason for assuming that any connexion between them again
existed. It is true that, according to the researches of MM.
Triger, Saemann, and Coquand, features occur in the grouping’
of the upper cretaceous deposits of La Sarthe (forming the
south-western margin of the Anglo-Frankish basin) similar in
all respects to those occurring in the Charentes, and indicating
a corresponding amount of depression during the upper cre
taceous epoch on either side of the isthmus formed by the
Jurassic deposits of the Vienne; but this similarity has refer
ence to a correspondence of depression only, and not to an
intimate zoological connexion—the Zoological relations of the
upper cretaceous deposits of the Charentes appearing to be with
those of the Pyrenees rather than with those of England and North
France *. It appears to me, therefore, that while, during the
upper cretaceous age, the Anglo-Frankish basin was well opened
to the ocean north-eastwards by the subsidence of the palaeozoic
barrier, the Charento-Pyrenean basin was opened in the con
trary direction to the ocean by the subsidence of the tract which,
during the previous part of the mesozoic period, joined Portugal
to England, and bounded that basin on the west, but that both
series of movements were alike correlated to or consequent upon
the elevation of the Pyrenean chain then in progress. In using
the expression “correlated to or consequent upon,” I desire to
guard myself against being understood to mean that these move
ments were entirely synchronous with the elevation of the Pyre
nees. Indeed it is not improbable that the subsidence of the
palaeozoic barrier preceded the elevation of the Pyrenees ; but the
relation of the movements in either area to each other was due
to one great band of volcanic action, which came into existence
from west to east during the lower cretaceous age, and of which
we have the most conspicuous effects exhibited in the great anti
clinal of the Pyrenees, and consequently refer to it, in one com
prehensive term, as the system of that chain.

                         By C. K. AKIN, Esg.*
 IN the following paper will be proposed a few remarks, made
        some considerable time ago, the gist or moot point of which
 is to be the degree of numerical accuracy belonging to the several
 formulae which have been computed by M. Regnault in the latter
 part of his celebrated memoir on the law of Boyle (or Mariette),
 from the experimental data contained in the early part 1'—-the pur
 pose which these formulae are to serve being to supplement or (if
 properly written) to supersede provisionally the Boylean formula
 to a certain extent, until the complete law of gaseous compressi
 bility shall have been theoretically or otherwise determined. The
 importance of the formulae referred to being obvious, the necessity
 of evaluating the several constants which they imply with all pos
 sible rigour, or with so much, at least, as the nature of the
 experimental groundwork upon which the formula rest will not
 1'ender futile to attempt, will be no less evident.            And if the
 actual deduction of the constants supplied should, as really ap
pears to the present writer, not ful<U+FB01>l the requirement speci<U+FB01>ed,
 within limits at once attainable and intended to be attained by
the computer, the obligation to direct attention to the matter
could not well be avoided, and is in this case the more easy to
comply with, as the means of remedying the observed short
comings may be readily pointed out.
     1. The <U+FB01>rst of the remarks to be submitted involves, as a ne
cessity, some preliminary statements as to the proper mode of
applying the law of Boyle in certain very common instances. If
there be nothing namely to object to in the ordinary de<U+FB01>nition
of this law, as the postulate requiring the direct proportionality
of pressures and densities, or the inverse proportionality of pres
sures and volumes, in gases when at a constant temperature,‘so
far as it goes, it must still be observed to stand in need of some
special help to interpretation, in the case of gaseous masses the
volumes encompassed by which are <U+FB01>nite in regard of vertical
extent. Or rather, whenever it is expedient to apply the law in

 this case, it will presently be proved to be necessary to depart
 from what are conventionally called the pressure and density of
 a gaseous mass in daily practice, and to exchange at least one or
 other, density or pressure as habitually understood, for one
 different from either. For since it is known, in the <U+FB01>rst place,
 that, consequent upon the action of gravity, each separate layer
 of in<U+FB01>nitesimal vertical extent, an aggregate of which only forms
 a <U+FB01>nite mass, has its own particular density and pressure, it will
 follow as a <U+FB01>rst consequence that only such densities and pres
 sures as in a given mass coexist in the same in<U+FB01>nitesimal layer
 can be considered as congruous or correlative within the mean
 ing of the Boylean law; whilst such densities and pressures as
 belong to drferent layers must be connected by some more com
 plicated formula, dependent on the magnitude of the mass which
 separates the layers considered. Practically, however, what
‘is denominated the pressure of a gaseous mass is the pressure
 of its lowest-situated layer, which is in contact with the liquid
 employed for evaluating the pressures in the manometer, this
 last pressure being generally alone accessible to measurement ;
 but for density, on the other hand, following the extended de<U+FB01>
 nition of the term, is taken the mean of the densities of all
 the component layers, or the mass divided by the volume—and
 this also in the sense of density of the integer mass. Since this
 last density, however, is necessarily identical with that of some
 medium layer situated between the top and bottom of the mass,
 considered as made up of a continuous pile of in<U+FB01>nitesimal hori
 zontal layers, whilst the pressure, before adverted to as generally
 viewed in the light of that of the mass considered as a whole,
 belongs, in fact, to the layer at the bottom only, it must be evi
 dent that these two, pressure and density as just described, are
 not correlatives in the sense which is implied by the Boylean
 law. Hence the necessity, as bottom-pressure and mean density
 are generally alone measurable, to take one or other of the
 two couples, pressure and density at the bottom, or mean pres
 sure and mean density, as characteristic of a gaseous mass--at
 least whenever it is desired to apply to such the law of Boyle,
 which above was shown to be inapplicable to the ‘densities and
 pressures of different layers promiscuously combined.
    The precaution enjoined in the preceding sentences it is cer
 tainly needless to take in ordinary applications of the Boylean
 law, for reasons which are su<U+FB01>iciently evident : in the case of M.
 Regnault’s experiments, however, to neglect it will entail appre
 ciable numerical errors, as shall now be shown. For this pur
 pose it will be necessary to quote a formula (the demonstration
 of which shall be given in an Appendix) exhibiting the actual
 relation between ordinary pressures and volumes (the former

being bottom-pressures, and the latter convertible with mean
densities) in gases, as deducible from the Boylean law. The
formula is the following,

So that, <U+FB01>nally, we arrive at the results presented in the following
Table :

    It appears also, on inspection of formula (I.), that there does
not exist, as implicitly assumed by M. Regnault in choosing the
variables of his empirical formulae, any generally valid relation
between the proportion of pressures and the proportion of volumes
in gases altogether independent of the absolute magnitudes of the
volumes. For, even if the law of Boyle held good, and adopting for
It its simplest expression, contained in formula (II.), the above rela
tion would still be dependent also on the difference of volumes;
so that to the same ratio of pressures different ratios of volumes
might correspond, according to the values of the differences
of the latter. But the bearing of this last observation, as well as
the in<U+FB02>uence of the (k,—1) on the <U+FB01>nal results of M. Regnault’s
calculations, could only be fully explained after premising some
other statements, which are now to follow. It will be well, how
 ever, to state at once that it is not intended to resume the above
 subject, as what is to be brought forward in the very next sen
 tences is of so much greater numerical importance, that it would
appear super<U+FB02>uous, on comparison, to bestow any more lines on
the present matter.
     2. The particular method adopted by M. Regnault in the inve
tigation here under review has been incidentally spoken of already
 in the preceding article; it consisted simply in this—a con1pres
 sing of different masses of gases of like initial volume, but varying
 density, to the same amount=% the primitive volume, noting at
 the same time the corresponding pressures.              But since it was the
 aim of these researches, the insuf<U+FB01>ciency of the Boylean law being
 once made patent, to determine empirically some other general
formula by means of which the pressure could be calculated on
knowing the density, or conversely *, the following subsidiary pro
cesses were resorted to for the purpose. The known values of /3
    * at least in cases where the temperature is not very different from that
at which the actual measurements were made.

    curve having the initial pressure pa for general abscissa, and 13

  might hence be used to determine the two or more constants of
  any such empirical formula, showing the pressure in the form of
  function of the density, or conversely, which has before been
  designated as the end of all these various operations; which last
   calculations M. Regnault of course actually accomplished.
       It is evident, however, that for the 11’s to have really the mean
  ing assigned to them above, it is necessary that the equa
  tions (B) be strictly attended to. Now it was found by M.
  Regnault in the <U+FB01>rst instance, and is mentioned by him as the
  primary result of his researches in question, that the law of
  Boyle is not accurate. This, applied to the case in hand, means
      * It is easy and instructive to translate the meaning of this artthmetica
  operation into the language of experiment.                                   '

 that (since:—"= 2) the following equations, referring to the 120’s in
                 1
 equations (A), will not hold good, viz.
         V-P1'=2Por P1"=2Po": ]'1'”=2Pom: and P1iv=2Poiv3
 consequently the following will be equally false,
                 pon=2por, pol/1:2“)!/, and piv=2p0III;
 and putting now for 120' its value Po, these last will be false
 (71 fortiori:                  -
                  ]70”=2P0» Po”'=4Po> and Poiv_=8Po
 Hence it would be erroneous to use in the above calculations, as
 M. Regnault has done, values of m having respectively for
 abscissae,
                         1'", 2'", 41"‘, and 8'” ;
 but such values ought to be chosen as the equations (B) neces
 sitate.
      The values of the proper m’s, and consequently their numerical
 variation from those actually employed, may be readily computed
 in the following manner. The value of m’, as to which there is
no difference, being known in numbers, as well as that of p0'=1,
120" =p1' may be calculated. Corresponding to 110", considered as
an abscissa, the curves will furnish a new ordinate, which is the
true m" 3 this, in its turn, will give po'”=p," : hence m'"; and
 so on. By this means it is easy to ascertain that in the case of
 CO2 gas, for instance, miv as assumed and its accurate value
 differ by more than 0006 ; and since in the values n, which are
formed by multiplication of the several m's, the errors of the
latter become successively summed (or nearly so), it is evident
that n“, for example, which is one of the numbers actually em
ployed in computing the constants so often already mentioned,
will be considerably more erroneous than even mi‘. It is evident
that in the case of CO2 gas, which is more compressible than
according to the Boylean law should happen, the compressibility
has been actually exaggerated in consequence of the above mis
understanding. But it is fair to add that the example quoted
shows this exaggeration far greater than would the other three
gases; in regard of one of which, viz. H, the error committed
amounts even to a diminution of apparent compressibleness,
though still an augmentation of deviation from law.
     3. In the Appendix will be found brie<U+FB02>y indicated a simple but
rigorous mode of evaluating the constants of any preferred em
pirical formula, by which to render more accurate, or rather to

Regnault’s investigation, and obviating any such intermediate.
deductions as are described above.
   Before entering, however, on the Appendix, it is necessary to
speak yet of a series of apparently casual errors which have crept
into M. Regnault’s calculations,——those mentioned above being,
if we err not, of the class generally designated as systematic.
The occurrence of such casual errors was <U+FB01>rst noticed by Prof.
Neumann of Konigsberg (who kindly directed my attention to
the matter) in the case of two of the values mbelonging to atmo
spheric air obtained in the manner stated in the previous article,
by observing that they varied more from the actually tabulated
similar values of nearly coincident argument than the difference
of arguments might seem to warrant. On reference to the curves
on which the m’s were professedly measured, the discrepancy, and
consequent presumption of mistake, was found con<U+FB01>rmed; and
on further extending the examination to the several m’s belonging
to other gases, and their respective curves, a number of addi
tional disagreements, similar to those <U+FB01>rst remarked in the in
stance of atmospheric air, were detected. The greatest of these
amounts numerically to 0001 exactly, belonging to CO2 gas ;
but whilst here the divergence is easy to explain, as owing to a
simple oversight in counting the divisions on the scale of ordi
nates (each of which is =O'OO1), as regards the minor errors
no account can apparently be given.
   A last series of errors (seemingly in writing) is met with in
pp. 411, 418, 419, and 424 of M. Regnault’s memoir,- to which,
however, this is not the place to furnish corrections. Similarly
it will be su<U+FB01>icient merely to advert to a singular statement in
p. 416, referring to the value of ,8 or (m—l) in the case of in
<U+FB01>nitesimal values of the argument 120, which clearly originates in
some misapprehension.

   4. The formula serving to express the accurate relation be-'
tween <U+FB01>nite volumes and ordinary pressures of gases, in the case
speci<U+FB01>ed in art..1, .is due to Prof. Neumann, by whom it was
deduced after the following manner, as communicated to the
writer. The mass M of a column of gas of the height a and
base = 1'3, is given by the integral
                          M=J;“p.a~, . .' . . . . . (i)
where p denotes the density of the layer whose distance from the
top of the column, supposed to be a cylinder or prism, is .z' ; and

B being the density corresponding to the normal pressure P; p,

density p belongs ; <U+FB01>nally, g = the acceleration of gravity. Dif

the limits a and .z', we shall <U+FB01>nd

or observing that
                   P=_qQH, and making g=D :
where Q denotes the density of the matter, and H the height of
the column, in which the normal pressure of the gas is to be eva

rate, it shall now‘ be shown how a formula similar to (1.), but
not implying the truthfulness of the Boylean law, may be de
duced, and ultimately serve to accomplish the purpose adverted
to in the beginning of art. 3. To arrive at this new formula, we

which is similar to that expressed by the Boylean law, except
that it involves an additional magnitude qb, by which that law

to form, ultimately by the aid of experimental or other data.

 may wish to supplement the Boylean law. With this object qb

to make it a function of a, or the mean density, and the density

 super<U+FB02>uous to insist here on what would be the best way to avail
oneself of the whole body of observations tabulated by M. Reg

fresh experiments on gaseous compressibility are mentioned
which call for a short supplemental remark. It should be stated,
in the <U+FB01>rst place, that these new measurements are not intended
to supersede the older, but were only made to meet an incidental

IT might be questioned whether this work ought to receive any
    notice in a scienti<U+FB01>c Journal, the character and contents of ‘it
being such that it can hardly be permitted to take rank among scien
ti<U+FB01>c productions. It is, in fact, singularly de<U+FB01>cient in one particular,
which has hitherto been considered essential in theoretical physics,
namely, the development of the results of assumed principles by
means of mathematical reasoning. As, however, advantage may be
derived from the scrutiny of a false or defective way of philosophizing,
we have thought it worth while to bring the work under review,
especially as the too con<U+FB01>dent tone in which it is written may gain
for it, among readers not quali<U+FB01>ed to judge of its contents scienti
<U+FB01>cally, an in<U+FB02>uence which may need to be counteracted. It is cer
tainly a very readable book, and embraces a great variety of scien
ti<U+FB01>c facts, for the most part clearly and correctly stated ; for which
reasons there is the more necessity for pointing out its radical faults.
   In page 10 there is a quotation from Newton's ‘ Principia,’ intro
duced with this remark :—“ The closing words of the ‘ Principia ’ are
like a prophecy, and show in what direction the second main series
of physical discovery must be attained.” We quite agree with this
estimate of the passage referred to, which, together with one quoted
in the next page from the ‘ Optics,’ may well be regarded as wonderful
evidence of Newton's genius and foresight. To make intelligible the '
subsequent criticisms it will be proper to adduce both these passages.
The one from the ‘Principia’ is as follows z-—‘' I might add something
about a certain very subtle spirit which pervades dense bodies and lies
hid in them; by the force and agency (vi et actionibus) of which,
bodies at very small distances attract each other, and when brought
close together, cohere; and electrical bodies act at greater distances.
both repelling and attracting neighbouring bodies ; and light is

emitted, re<U+FB02>ected, refracted, in<U+FB02>ected, and warms bodies; and all
sensation is excited, and the limbs of animals are moved nt will, that
is, by vibrations of this spirit propagated through the solid <U+FB01>bres of
the nerves from the external organs of sense to the brain, and from
the brain to the muscles. But these things cannot be expounded in
few words ; neither does there exist a su<U+FB02>icient abundance of expe
riments, by which the laws of the action of this spirit can be accu
rately determined and demonstrated." The following is the quotation
from the ‘ Optics’ :—-“ Is not heat conveyed through a vacuum by the
vibrations of a much more subtile medium than air P Is not this me
dium the same by which light is refracted and re<U+FB02>ected, and commu
nicates heat to bodies, and is put into <U+FB01>ts of easy re<U+FB02>exion and trans
mission? Do not hot bodies communicate their heat to cold ones by
 the vibrations of this medium P And is it not exceedingly more rare
 and subtile than air, and exceedingly more elastic and active? And
 does it not readilypervade all bodies P And is it not, by its elastic force,
 expanded through all the heavens?" Two inferences may clearly
 be drawn from these views :—<U+FB01>rst, that according to Newton the
 forces of nature are resident in avery subtle spirit, or medium, which
 pervades all other bodies, and is extremely elastic ; that they are, in
 fact, modes of action of this medium, one of which he particularly
 speci<U+FB01>es, namely, action by vibrations : secondly, that he ascribes no
 active power, or virtue, to bodies which are distinct from the elastic
 medium. In another part of the third book (Regula III.), he says
 expressly, “ I by no means affirm that gravity is essential to bodies."
 Also there is 'no evidence in the above passages, or elsewhere in
 Newton's writings, that he took account of an atomic constitution
 of the medium, the very term “ elastic,” as used in his sense, im
 plying that he regarded it as continuous, and acting by pressure just
 as the air does, only in much greater degree. Now let us turn to
 Mr. Birks’s views. At the same time that he adduces Newton's
 " prophecy," he appears to do all he can to falsify it. The general
 view that he takes of matter is that “it consists of monads, or
 moveable centres of force, unextended, but de<U+FB01>nite in position.”
 Such monads, which in other places he calls “ atoms ” and “ parti
 cles,” without expressly ascribing to them extension or inertia, he
 considers to be the constituents both of the aether, and of visible and
 tangible bodies. Thus he opposes Newton in two most important
 particulars: <U+FB01>rst, in making active force an essential quality of the
 constituents of visible bodies, whereas Newton in Regula III. allows
 of no other essential force (vim insitam) in such bodies than the vis
 inertia: ; and again, in making it an essential condition of his physical
 theory to regard the aether as consisting of monads.
    Again, there is a passage in the Regula III., as remarkable as the
 two before quoted, which also contains views directly opposed to
 those of Mr. Birks. Newton says, “The extension, hardness, impene
 ti-ability, mobility, and vis inertia: of the whole arise from the very
 same qualities of the parts; and thence we conclude that all the
 least parts of all bodies are extended, hard, impenetrable, moveable,
 and endowed with vis inertia’.       And this is the foundation of all

302                  Notices respecting New Books.
philosophy." Against this dictum the author argues as follows
 (p. 27) : “ Our <U+FB01>rst_ impressions of matter are derived from solids,
and their resistance to touch, or pressure of the hand. Hence the
nature of matter has often been de<U+FB01>ned by extension and solidity;
But the progress of science has shown the error of such a de<U+FB01>nition.
The sensation of solidity is evidently compound, and arises from a
repulsive force exerted along a well-de<U+FB01>ned surface. This repulsion
begins before actual contact, and appears to he a rapidly decreasing
power, which emanates from the outer particles of the resisting sub
stance. When it is melted or vaporized, the substance remains, but
its law of force is altered, and the sensation of solidity disappears.
Again, the impenetrability of matter,‘ in the popular sense, is dis
proved by the facts of chemical combination.” The answer to all
this is, that the arguments are directed against non-essentials in
Newton's de<U+FB01>nition of the “ least parts of bodies.” The point
of primary importance is that, as all experience shows, we have no
perception by the senses of body, and, therefore, no conception of
body, apart from extension. On this point metaphysics and physics,
Locke and Newton, agree. But if the ultimate parts of bodies have
extension, they must be solids (in the geometrical sense), and if they
are solids, they must have form. Here, however, so much as this
may be conceded, that the terms “ hardness ” and “ impenetrability "
are open to the objection made by Mr. Birks that, as these qualities
are understood by experience, they admit of degrees. But this ob
jection is met, and at the same time the de<U+FB01>nition in all that is es
sential is retained, if we say that an ultimate particle which has form,
has a constant form. This hypothetical property of an atom is to be
adopted on the principle, laid down by Mr. Birks himself in his
Axiom II. (p. 4), that it is the “ simplest” conceivable. The varia
bility of form exhibited by masses is shown by the progress of
science to be due to their being composed of discrete atoms, and it
would therefore be introducing a needless complexity to attribute
the same variability to the atoms.
    In short the grand and leading principle of the Newtonian Philo
sophy is to deduce by means of mathematics from the fundamental
ideas of form, inertia, and pressure, results by which observed phe
nomena and laws may be explained, the data for the solution of the
particular problems being also furnished by experimental observation.
If then the philosophy which Newton taught and endeavoured to
hand down to succeeding times be true, and be truly represented
above, works such as that before us must contain a kind of scienti<U+FB01>c
heresy. For not only have we here direct antagonism in de<U+FB01>ning a
monad, or atom, to be a centre of force irrespective of the quality of
extension, but this <U+FB01>rst departure from the simplicity of Newton's
fundamental ideas necessitates other complexities, and gives rise
to the conceptions of axes, rotations, polarities, and centrifugal
force of atoms, which play a large part in the author’s system, and
to which effects are ascribed that seem incapable of illustration by
reference to commonly observed phenomena. On the contrary, the
Newtonian “foundation of all philosophy ” involves only ideas that

                     Notices respecting New Books.                  303
are perfectly comprehensible by the commonest experience, and it is
this very circumstance that gives reality to the scienti<U+FB01>c erection that
may be reared upon it.
   But it is not because Mr. Birks’s views are opposed to Newton's,
and cannot, therefore, be considered as making any advance in the
direction which Newton indicated, that we hesitate to call his work
scienti<U+FB01>c. Other writers of the present day have equally disregarded
Newton’s authority; for, in fact, in matters of science there is no
such thing as absolute authority. It may therefore be conceded to
Mr. Birks that he is able by akind of intuition to perceive that each
monad of matter forms an indissoluble union with a monad of rather.
But when from this beginning he goes on to account for a great va
riety of physical facts, which he appears to do with much facility and
con<U+FB01>dence, ordinary individuals will ask to be conducted to the conclu
sions step by step. The intuition which may serve him will not serve
them. There is a recognized method by which a philosopher whose
perception of physical causes is in advance of that of his contempo
raries can compel assent to his views, and make them common
property,—the method of reasoning by symbols, and by the formation
and solution of simple and differential equations. Newton's principles
of Natural Philosophy were mathematical principles, and his mathe
matics of the highest order for the time. Nothing short of the In
telligence which framed the Universe can dispense with such means
 of ascertaining the causes of phenomena. It is scarcely credible
that a mathematician in these days should have written a book which
pretends to give explanations in the whole range of physical science,
 without introducing a single differential equation. This is showing
 a disregard of methods that have been generally thought to be indis
pensable, which on no ground can be justi<U+FB01>ed. We suspect that if
 Mr. Birks attempted to transfer his thoughts into symbolic language
 for the purpose of tracing consequences by the aid of mathematical
 reasoning, he would begin to see the magnitude and difficulty of the
 task he has undertaken. This radical defect in the work, which ex
 cludes the possibility of deciding whether or not the explanations it
 offers are purely imaginary, obliges us to pronounce ittobe unscienti<U+FB01>c.
    In order to show that these strictures are not made without good
 reason, it may suflice to adduce one specimen of the author’s mode
 of accounting for natural phenomena. To explain the chemical pro
 duction of heat he writes (p. 109) as follows :—
    “ The present hypothesis, I believe, provides a full and complete
 explanation. Heat is simply atomic or molecular vis viva. Sensible
 heat depends on the oscillations of the solid atoms,transferred through
 the repulsion of their constituent or adjacent aether to neighbouring
 atoms, and producing vibrations which can radiate freely through air
 or in vacuo, like the -waves of light. Heat of <U+FB02>uidity consists in the
 vis viva of each atom in revolving on its own axis of greatest moment,
 whereby the polarity of neighbouring atoms is weakened or destroyed.
 Heat of vaporization consists in the via viva spent or absorbed in
 removing the chemical atoms to a greater mean distance beyond the
 limit of maximum cohesive power, so that the centrifugal force is

304»                        Royal Society :—
balanced only by some external pressure. But besides these varieties
of heat, depending on the solid, <U+FB02>uid, or gaseous structure of the
whole body, there will be another variety, an atomic heat, depending
on the essential structure of the compound atoms themselves. It
will be least where their monads are most compact, and greatest when
they are at greater intervals from each other.”
   Surely these numerous assertions can only be regarded as expres
sions of personal conceptions, the correspondence of which to physical
realities is proved neither by immediate explanations of phenomena,
nor by explanations deduced by mathematical reasoning. There is,
for instance, a wide gap which requires <U+FB01>lling up, between asserting
that each atom revolves about its axis of greatest moment and by its
vis viva weakens or destroys the polarity of neighbouring atoms, and
explaining how by this action <U+FB02>uidity results. Besides, if the views
in the above passage corresponded to realities, the realities would
just as much require explanation as the fact of chemical combustion
which it was proposed to explain. Nothing therefore is gained by
multiplying such conceptions. Science advances in proportion as
the explanations of phenomena are reduced to few and de<U+FB01>nite ideas
derived immediately fromexperiment and observation. Thus Newton
added greatly to our knowledge by proving mathematically that the
force which produces the motions of planets and satellites, whatever
intrinsically it may be, is not different in kind from that which causes
a stone to fall to the ground.
   Although we have thought it right to express our dissent from
Mr. Birks’s theoretical principles, we are ready to admit that his
work is not altogether unworthy of a mathematician who gained high
distinction in the University of Cambridge. Much care and labour
have evidently been bestowed on its composition, and it shows large
and accurate acquaintance with the existing state of physical science.
Excepting where he is attributing in<U+FB02>uences to his wonder-working
“dual atom,” his theoretical views are generally sensible and dis
criminating. They are not, however, always new. Some of the ex
planations, for instance, contained in the articles in Chap. V., on the
relations between Light and Sound, and on Musical Tones and
Colours compared, will be found in the Report of the British Asso
ciation for 1834, and in vol. xii. (S. 4) of this Magazine.

       “On the Photographic Transparency of various Bodies, and on
the Photographic Effects of Metallic and other Spectra obtained by
means of the Electric Spark.” By Prof. W. Allen Miller, M.D.,
LL.D., V.P. and Treas. lt.S.
   In this paper the author pursues an inquiry the commencement

       On the Photographic Transparency of various Bodies.           305
of which was communicated to the Chemical Section of the British
Association last year. Owing to the employment of a prism of hi
sulphide of carbon, he was then led to believe that the photographic
effects of the electric spectra produced by the different metals were
in a great degree similar, if not identical.  Subsequent investigations
have, however, shown him that the absorbent e<U+FB02>'ects of the bisul
phide upon the chemical rays are so great, that the conclusions then
drawn from observations made by this refracting medium require
very considerable modi<U+FB01>cation.       Notwithstanding the great length
of the chemical spectra obtained by the aid of the bisulphide, not
more than one-sixth or one-seventh of the true extent of the spectrum
produced by the electric spark between various metals is procured,
as may be shown by comparing the spectrum with one of the same
metal furnished by the use of a lens and prism of rock-crystal.
   Rock-crystal, however, possesses but a comparatively small refrac
tive and dispersive power, whilst it almost always affords some trace
of double refraction in one portion or other of the spectrum procured
by its means.
   In searching for some singly refractiiig medium which should
possess su<U+FB01>icient refractive and dispersive power to enable it to be
used advantageously in the construction of lenses and prisms suitable
for this inquiry, the author was led to examine the photographic
absorption of a variety of colourless substances which appeared per
fectly transparent to the luminous rays. The experiments detailed
in the <U+FB01>rst portion of the present paper refer to this absorbent
action of various media upon the chemical rays of the spectrum;
whilst the second portion of the paper is devoted to a description of
the electric spectra of some of the more important elementary bodies,
and the effect of varying the gaseous media in which the sparks
producing these spectra are made to originate.
   l. The Photographic Transparency of Bodie8.—In the experi
ments upon the absorbent action of the different media, the source
of light employed was the electric spark obtained between two
metallic wires (generally of <U+FB01>ne silver), connected with the terminals
of the secondary wires of a ten-inch induction-coil. The light, after
passing through a narrow vertical slit, either before or after traversing
a stratum of the material the chemical transparency or diactinic
quality of which was to be tested, was allowed to fall upon a quartz
prism placed at the angle of minimum deviation for the mean of the
refracted rays. Immediately behind this was a lens of rock-crystal,
and behind this, at a suitable distance, the spectrum was received
upon a collodion-<U+FB01>lm coated with iodide of silver; this was sup
ported in the frame of a camera, and after an exposure, generally
lasting for five minutes, the image was developed by means of pyro
gallic acid, and <U+FB01>xed with cyanide of potassium.
   The general results of these experiments were as follows :
   1. Colour-less bodies which are equally transparent to the visible
rays, vary greatly in permeability to the chemical rays.
   2. Bodies which are photographically transparent in the solid
form, preserve their transparency in the liquid and in the gaseous states.

    3. Colourless transparent solids which exert a considerable pho
 tographic absorption, preserve their absorptive action with greater or
 less intensity both in the liquid and in the gaseous states.
    Whether the compound is lique<U+FB01>ed by heat or dissolved in water,
 these conclusions respecting liquids are equally true. The perfect
 permeability of water to the chemical rays, conjoined with the cir
 cumstance that in no instance does the process of solution seem to
 interfere with the special action upon the incident rays of the sub
 stance dissolved, renders it practicable to submit to this test a great
 number of bodies which it would otherwise be impossible to subject
 to this species of experiment on account of the extreme di<U+FB01>iculty of
 obtaining them in crystals of su<U+FB02>icient size and limpidity.
    Glass vessels cannot be employed to contain theliquids during the
 trial. Flint-glass, crown, hard white Bohemian, plate-glass, window
 sheet, and Faraday’s optical glass, all, even in thin layers, shorten
 the spectrum by from three-<U+FB01>fths to four-<U+FB01>fths or even more of its
 length.   Mica produces a similar effect.   Indeed, the only substance
 which the author found could be employed with advantage is rock
 crystal cut into thin slices and polished. The value of this material
 in researches upon the more refrangible end of the spectrum was
 pointed out by Prof. Stokes and M. E. Becquerel several years ago.
 In order to hold the liquids for experiment, a small trough was pre
 pared by cutting a notch in a thick plate of plate-glass, the sides
 being completed by means of thin plates of quartz, which were pressed
 against the ground surfaces of the plate-glass by the aid of elastic
 bands of caoutchouc; a stratum of liquid of 0'75 inch in depth was
 thus obtained for each experiment.
    The substances which, after atmospheric air and certain other
gases, are most perfectly diactinic, are rock-crystal, ice, as well as
pure water, and white <U+FB02>uor-spar.       Rock-salt is scarcely inferior to
them, if at all.    Then follow various sulphates, including those of
baryta, and the hydrated sulphates of lime and magnesia, as well as
those of the alkalies.    The carbonates of the alkalies and alkaline
earths, as also the phosphates, arseniates, and borates, are likewise
tolerably transparent, though saturated solutions of phosphoric and
arsenic acids exerted considerable absorbent power; so also did those
of the alkalies, potash, and soda, possibly from the presence of a
trace of some foreign colouring matter, as those liquids had an ex
tremely faint greenish tinge.
    The soluble <U+FB02>uorides, as well as the chlorides and bromides of the
metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths, are freely diactinic, but the
iodides are much less so, and exhibit certain peculiarities. All the
organic acids and their salts which were tried by the author exerteda
marked absorptive action upon the more refrangible rays. Amongst
those subjected to experiment were the oxalates, tartrates, acetates,
and citrates, those mentioned <U+FB01>rst in order having the greatest ab- ‘
sorptive action. It is, however, much more di<U+FB02>icult to obtain or
ganic compounds in a state of purity sufficient to furnish trustworthy
results, than is the case with the salts of the inorganic acids. The
author, therefore, expresses himself with more reserve upon some of

         On the Photorqraphic Transparency of various Bodies.         307
  these organic bodies, particularly the acetates, than in other cases.
  The different varieties of sugar are freely diactinic.
     Amongst the salts of inorganic acids, the nitrates are the most
  remarkable for their power of arresting the chemical rays.      A solu
  tion of each of these salts, in all the instances tried, out off all the
  more refrangible.rays, and reduced the spectrum to less than a sixth
  of its ordinary length. The chlorates, however, do not participate
  in this absorptive power to nearly the same extent.
     Although the sulphates, as a class, are largely diactinic, the sul
  phites are much less so ; and the hyposulphites cut off about three
  fourths of the length of the spectrum, leaving only the less re
  frangible portion.
     Of eighteen different liquids tried by the author, two only can be
  regarded as tolerably diactinic, viz. water, which is eminently so,
  and absolute alcohol, which, however, exhibits a considerable falling
 off. The liquids which follow are mentioned in the order of their
  chemical transparency, those most transparent being mentioned <U+FB01>rst:
  —Dutch liquid, chloroform, ether; then benzol and distilled gly
  cerin, which differ but little; then fouscl oil, wood-s irit, and oxalic
  ether, which are also nearly alike; acetic acid, oil) of turpentine,
' glycol, carholic acid, liquid paraffin, boiling at 360° F., and bisul
  phide of carbon. Finally, terchloride and oxychlo<U+FB01>de of phosphorus,
  although perfectly colourless and limpid, arrest all the chemical rays.
     The experiments upon aériform bodies yielded important results;
  they show but little coincidence with those of Tyndall on the
  absorptive power of the gases for radiant heat. These experiments
  were made by interposing in the track of the ray between the ver
  tical slit and the quartz prism, a brass tube two feet long, closed at
  each end air-tight by means of a plate of quartz. Each gas or
  vapour in succession was introduced into the tube, and the results
  compared with those produced by causing the rays to traverse the
  tube when ‘<U+FB01>lled with atmospheric air.
     Amongst the colourless gases, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, car
  bonic acid, and carbonic oxide exhibit no absorptive power.
     Ole<U+FB01>ant: gas, protoxide of nitrogen, cyanogen, and -hydrochloric
  acid exert a slight but_ perceptible absorbent effect. But in the case
  of c0al-gas- the absorptive action is extremely marked, the more
  refrangible half of the spectrum being cut off by it abruptly. The
  absorption exerted by sulphurous acid is still more powerful and as
  sharply de<U+FB01>ned ; sulphuretted hydrogen and the vapour of bisulphide
  of carbon exhibit a still more decided absorbent action; the effect of
  the terchloride and oxychloride of phosphorus is not less marked.
  This absorbent action of these different compounds of sulphur and
  phosphorus is very striking.
     Coal-gas appears to owe its remarkable power of arresting the
  chemical rays to the presence of the vapour of benzol and other
  heavy hydrocarbons; since the vapour of benzol at 65°, diffused to
  saturation through a column of atmospheric air two feet long, exerts
  a still more powerful absorptive effect than coal-gas.

 the vapour of ether, of chloroform, and of oil of turpentine was sub
 stituted for that of benzol, gave effects which, though perceptible,
 were much less marked. An arbitrary scale is laid down, by which
  a comparative estimate of the absorptive power of each compound,
  whether solid, liquid, or gaseous, may be effected with tolerable
  accuracy.
    With a view of facilitating the production of a spectrum on a <U+FB02>at
 <U+FB01>eld, at a uniform distance at all points from the prism, the author
 instituted a series of experiments, in which a small metallic speculum
 was substituted for the lens of rock-crystal ; but the loss of chemical
 power in the re<U+FB02>ected rays was so considerable, and this loss occurred
 so unequally at different points, that the method was abandoned.
 The results of the photographic action of light re<U+FB02>ected at an angle
 of 45° from the polished surface of several of the principal metals is
 given. The re<U+FB02>exion from gold, although not very intense, was
 found to be more uniform in quality than that from any other metal
 that was tried. Burnished lead also gave very good results. The
 re<U+FB02>exion from silver is singularly de<U+FB01>cient in some portions of the
 less refrangible rays, although in most other parts the re<U+FB02>exion is
 tolerably perfect, except for rays of extremely high refrangibility.
    2. The Electric Spectra of the llIetals.—The author proceeds
 then to detail his experiments upon the spectra obtained by causing
 the sparks produced by the secondary current from the induction-coil
 to pass between electrodes composed of various elementary sub
 stances, and he gives photographs of the impressions obtained from
 collodion negatives of a considerable number of different elementary
 bodies. The spectra were procured by arranging a quartz-train in
 the manner already described. Among the elements so examined
 are the following :—
       Platinum .           Arsenic.                   Copper.
      Palladium.            Tellurium.                 Aluminum.
       Gold .               Tungsten.                  Cadmium .
       Silver.              Molybdenum .                Zinc.
      Mercury.              Chromium .                 Magnesium .
      Lead. ‘               Manganese.                 Sodium.
      Tin.                  Iron.                      Potassium.
      Bismuth.              Cobalt.                    Graphite, and
      Antimony.             Nickel.                    Gas-coke.
    The commencement of each spectrum in its less refrangible portion
is similar in nearly all cases; and as it is this portion only which is trans
missible through bisulphide of carbon, this circumstance explains the
similarity of all the spectra procured by the author from different
metals in his earlier experiments, already laid before the British Asso
ciation. In the more refrangible parts of the spectrum great and cha
racteristic differences between the results obtained with the different
metals are at once manifest.      In some cases, as in those of copper and
nickel, the action is greatly prolonged in the more refranQble extre
mity, whilst the inteuse and highly characteristic spectrum of magne
sium is much shorter.

        On the Pl1oto_r/rapIn'c T1'an.<parmcy of various Bodies.    309
     In many cases metals which are allied in chemical properties ex
 hibit a certain similarity in their spectra. This occurs, for example,
  with the magnetic metals, iron, cobalt, and nickel, and with the
 group embracing bismuth, antimony, and arsenic.         The more vola
 tile metals exhibit generally the most strongly marked lines. Cad
 mium, for instance, gives two intense groups. Zinc, two very strong
 lines near the less refrangible extremity, three near the middle, and
 four nearly equidistant lines towards the termination of the more
 refrangible portion, whilst in the spectrum of magnesium the che
 mical action is almost suddenly terminated near the middle by a
 triple group of very broad and strong lines.
    It will be observed, on examining the photographs of these spectra
 of the various metals, that the impressions, particularly in the more
 refrangible portions, consist of a double row of dots, running parallel
 with the length of the spectrum, and forming the terminations of
 lines rather than lines themselves, as though the intense ignition of
 the detached particles of metal, necessary to furnish rays capable of
 exciting chemical action, had ceased before the transfer of these par
 ticles to the opposite electrode had been completed.
    If each electrode be composed of a different metal, the spectrum
 of each metal is impressed separately upon the plate, as is evident
 on examining the photographs.
    When alloys are employed as electrodes, the spectrum exhibited
 is that due to both the metals; but if the metals made use of are
 approximatively pure, the spectrum is hardly to be distinguished from
that of the pure metal.         In the case when alloys are used as
electrodes, it is not always the more volatile metal which impresses
its spectrum most strongly.        A specimen of brass, for example,
 containing 38 per cent. of zinc, gave a spectrum which could not be
 distinguished from that of pure copper, though an alloy of three
parts of gold and one of silver gave a spectrum in which the lines
 due to silver predominated.
    The author then proceeds to describe a number of experiments
upon the transmission of sparks between electrodes of different
metals in a current of several different gases. The apparatus em
ployed consisted of a glass tube; into the side an aperture was drilled,
which could he closed by a plate of quartz; the ends of the tube
were closed by ground brass plates, each supporting a pair of brass
forceps, into which the electrodes were <U+FB01>tted ; through the axis of the
tube a current of each gas was transmitted at the ordinary atmo
spheric pressure.
    Among the gases thus tried were hydrogen, protoxide of nitrogen,
carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, ole<U+FB01>ant gas, ma1'sh—gas, cyanogen,
sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphurous acid, nitrogen, and oxygen. The
Spectrum obtained from the same metal varied considerably in these
different media. In hydrogen the intensity of the spectrum was
greatly reduced, and the more refrangiblc rays were wanting, but
no new rays made their appearance. In carbonic acid, carbonic
oxide, ole<U+FB01>ant gas, marsh-gas, and cyanogen, the special lines due to
the metal were produced, but in each a series of identical lines

  310                '      Royal Society :—
  appeared, and these new lines were referable to the carbon con
  tained in each of these gases. Each gas exhibits special lines which
  are continued across the spectrum, and are never interrupted like
  those of the metals.
     The author observed that many of these gases, such as protoxide
  of nitrogen, hydrochloric and sulphurous acid, presented a consider
  able obstacle to the passage of the sparks from the induction-coil.
      “ On the Long Spectrum of Electric Light.” By Professor George
   G. Stokes, M.A., Sec. R.S. &c.
     The author’s researches on <U+FB02>uorescence had led him to perceive
  that glass was opaque for the more refrangible invisible rays of the
  solar spectrum, and that electric light contained rays of still higher
  refrangibility, which were quite intercepted by glass, but that quartz
  transmitted these rays freely.     Accordingly he was led to procure
  prisms and a lens of quartz, which, when applied to the examination
. of the voltaic are, or of the discharge of a Leyden jar, by forming a
  pure spectrum and receiving it on a highly <U+FB02>uorescent substance,
  revealed the existence of rays forming a spectrum no less than six
  or eight times as long as the visible spectrum. This long spectrum,
  as formed by the voltaic arc with copper electrodes, was exhibited
  at a lecture given at the Royal Institution in 1853; but the
  author, for reasons he mentioned, did'n0t then further pursue the
  subject. Having subsequently found that the spark of an induction
  coil with a Leyden jar in connexion with the secondary terminals
  yielded a spectrum quite bright enough to work by, he resumed
  the investigation, and examined the spectra exhibited by a variety of
  metals as electrodes, as well as the mode of absorption of the rays
  of high refrangibility by various substances. The spectra of the
  metals may be viewed at pleasure by means of <U+FB02>uorescence, and the
  mode of absorption of the invisible rays by a given solution may be
  at once observed ; but there are di<U+FB01>iculties attending the preparation
  in this way of su<U+FB02>iciently accurate maps of the metallic lines; and
  the great liability of the rays of high refrangibility to be absorbed
  by impurities present in very minute quantity renders the certain
  determination of the optical character, in this respect, of substances
  which are only moderately opaque a matter of considerable di<U+FB01>iculty.
  Having found that Dr. Miller had been engaged independently at
  the same subject, working by photography, the author deemed it
  unnecessary to attempt a delineation of the metallic lines (for which,
  however, he has recently devised a practical method that was found
  to work satisfactorily), or to examine further the absorption of rays
   of high refrangibility by solutions of metallic salts, &c.
     The present paper contains therefore mainly results obtained in
  other directions in the same wide <U+FB01>eld of research. Among the
  metals examined, the author had found aluminium the richest in
  invisible rays of extreme refrangibility; and accordingly aluminium
  electrodes were employed when the deportment of such rays had to
  be specially examined. As the bright aluminium lines of high re
  frangibility do not appear to have been taken by photography, a

   drawing of the aluminium spectrum is given, with zinc and cadmium
   for comparison.
      The author has also described and <U+FB01>gured the mode of absorption
, of the invisible rays by solutions of various alkaloids and glucosides.
   Bodies of these classes, he <U+FB01>nds, are usually intensely opaque, acting on
   the invisible spectrum with an intensity comparable to that with which
   colouring matters act on the visible. This intensity of action causes
   the effect of minute impurities to disappear, and thereby increases
  the value of the characters observed. It very often happens that at
   some part or other of the long. spectrum a band of absorption, or
   maximum of opacity, occurs; and the position of this band affords
  a highly distinctive character of the substance which produced it.
      Among natural crystals, besides the previously known yellow
  uranite, the author found that in adullaria, and felspar generally, a
   strong <U+FB02>uorescence is produced under the action of the rays of high
   refrangibility, referable not to impurities, but to the essential con
   stituents of the crystal.    A particular variety of <U+FB02>uor-spar shows
   also an interesting feature, though in this case referable to an im
  purity, exhibiting a well-marked reddish <U+FB02>uorescence under the
   exclusive in<U+FB02>uence of rays of the very highest refrangibility. This
  property renders such a crystal a useful instrument of research.
     With some metals broad, slightly convex electrodes were found to
  have a great advantage over wires, exhibiting the invisible lines far
  more strongly, while with some metals the diiference was not
  ‘great.
     The blue negative light formed when the jar is removed, and the
  electrodes are close together, was found to be exceedingly rich in
  invisible rays, especially invisible rays of moderate refrangibility.
  These exhibited lines independent of the electrodes, and therefore
  referable to the air. This blue light has a very appreciable duration,
  and is formed by what the author calls an arc discharge.
     The paper concludes with some speculations as to the cause of the
  superiority of broad electrodes, and of the heating of the negative
  electrode.                              "

     The principal object of this memoir is to develope the laws of the
  distribution of temperature in the portion of the atmosphere in con
  tact with the earth, and to point out the connexion between the phe
  nomena of aerial temperature and those of soil and oceanic tempera
  ture. The author maintains that hitherto no perfect physical repre
  sentation of the distribution of heat over the earth’s surface has
  been obtained. Humboldt’s luminous method of representing the
  distribution of mean temperatures necessarily presents us with the
  temperatures of places at those hours of local time when the tempe
  rature happens to be equal to that of the entire day. But such hours

   occur at different places not at the same moment of absolute time, and
   therefore the isothermal lines traced by the aid of their results alone,
   are not true isothermal lines in the same sense as we understand
   an isothermal line or surface within crystals, or other de<U+FB01>nite geo
   metrical solids which have been recently the subjects of thermological

  in (Theydistribution   of sunshine at the outer limits of the atmosphere
  and at its base is <U+FB01>rst considered, and the nearly circular shape of
  the lines of equal sunshine is pointed out. After showing the con
  nexion between these lines and the simultaneous isothermals for the
  air, land, and water, the author proceeds to discuss more particularly
  the aérothermal lines. As the term isothermal line has become uni
  versal in the sense of a line joining places possessing the same mean
  temperatures, the author proposes to designate the true lines of si
  multaneous equal temperature as synthermal lines. If any number
  of places have the same temperature at a given hour corresponding
  to the mean time of any one meridian, these places will be synthermal,
  and a line joining them will be a synthermal line. For this purpose
  the meridian of Greenwich has been selected, and a series of syn
  thermal Tables have been calculated for different places corre
  sponding to the Greenwich hours. For the construction of these
 Tables, the hourly observations of temperature made at the British
  Home and Colonial Observatories, the observations of Russia, Austria,
  Prussia, and Central Europe, as well as those of the United States,
 have been employed. The few series of hourly observations made
 by Arctic and African travellers have been also applied ; and in addi
 tion to the Tables thus directly constructed, others have been deduced
 by interpolation for stations whose geographical position rendered
 it desirable to bring them into the general view of temperature-clis
 tribution. All results expressed in Centigrade and Reaumur degrees
 have been reduced to the Fahrenheit scale. A fresh set of Tables
 has been formed from those corresponding to local time, with hours
 corresponding to the meridian at Greenwich.
     The synthermal Tables thus obtained show, as might be 1) priori
 expected, still greater differences between the temperatures of places
 in the same parallels of latitude than the Tables of mean temperature.
 Thus Rome and Ti<U+FB02>is differ in latitude by only 13', and the mean
 temperature of Rome is 5°'l in excess of that of Ti<U+FB02>is. At 8 A.M.
 Greenwich time, they are synthermal, both possessing the tempera
 ture of 59°'l, while at 7 A.M. Ti<U+FB02>is surpasses Rome by 0°'6, and at all
 other times besides these Rome surpasses Ti<U+FB02>is. At 4 A.M. this
 excess amounts to 9°'5. Although Pekin is situated in the isother
mal line which passes close to the Isle of Wight, it is synthermal at
 5A.M. (Greenwich) to some place 6° warmer than Rome, and pro
bably therefore on the north coast of Africa, and is synthermal
with a point north of the Orkneys at between 8 and 9 in the
evening. Similar comparisons of distant places in both hemispheres
lead to similar results. It appears that during certain periods of the
day, alternately hot and cold spaces exist in the interior of the con
tinents compared to the surrounding oceans.        In the southern hemi

sphere the rising of synthermal temperatures appears to be a little
inferior to what it is in the northern, it' we compare together stations
with nearly corresponding latitudes and di<U+FB01>erences of longitude in
both hemispheres.
    From the results tabulated in his synthermal Tables, the author has
projected on an equatorial map of the world, the synthermal lines of
4 A.M. and 2P.M. Greenwich time. This map clearly exhibits the
risings of the synthermals, and the existence of spaces of maximum
-temperature. The synthermals in both hemispheres rise towards the
poles opposite these spaces, and converge towards the space of mini
mum tropical temperature. In islands circumstanced like the British
 Isles, the synthermals may be represented by two systems of closed
 curves, one for the day with an interior space of maximum tempera
-ture, and the other for the night with an interior space of minimum
temperature. These groups would be connected somewhat in the
way of the magnetic curves delineated by Gauss in his Theory of
Terrestrial Magnetism (Taylor’s Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs, vii.). The
shapes of these groups would closely resemble the isothermals already
published by the author*, and which, from the small differences of
longitude in our islands, may be conceived to represent very closely
the synthermals of 9 A.M. and 8 P.M.

shown that they must not only present far more remarkable devia
 tions from equatorial parallelism than the synaérothermals, but also
that their diurnal rising must be very considerable.
    The author points to the connexion between some of his results
 and the diurnal law of the wind force discovered by Mr. Osler ; and
 he also shows how the abnormal regressions of temperature in the
 latter months of spring may be partly explained by the circumstance
 that, although the isothermals of mean temperature during these
 months do not deviate widely from equatorial parallelism, the syn
 thermals not only swing to a greater extent than during most of the
 other months of the year, but that they are also more closely crowded
 to ether.

 lished in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, entitled
 " On the Application of the Theory of Probabilities to the Question
 of the Combination of Testimonies or Judgments.” The latter con
 tains also the foundations of the general analytical theory of the
 method. But the complete development of that theory is attended
 with mathematical difficulties which I have only just succeeded in
 overcoming.
    A correspondence on the subject between Mr. Cayley and myself
 also appears in the May Number of the ‘ Philosophical Maga
 zine,’ and I owe it to Mr. Cayley that - these further researches,
 of the results of which an account will here be given, were under
 taken.
    I shall make but few remarks here upon the :2 priori grounds of
the method. Generally it may be said that the solution of a question
 in the Theory of Probabilities depends upon the possibility of men
tally constructing the problem from hypotheses which appear, whether
 as a consequence of our knowledge or as a consequence of our igno
rance, to be simple and independent. When the data are the proba
bilities of simple events, and no conditions are added, the problem is
in theory su<U+FB01>iciently easy, the sole di<U+FB01>iculty consisting in the calcu
lation of complex combinations.       But when the data are the proba
bilities of compound events, or when the events are connected by
absolute conditions expressible in logical propositions, or when both
these circumstances are present, the difficulty of the required mental
construction becomes greater. If we assume the independence of the
simple events f'rom which the compound events according to their
expression in language are formed, we meet, <U+FB01>rst, the di<U+FB02>iculty that
the number of equations thus formed may be greater or less than
that which is requisite to obtain a solution; and, secondly, the far more
fundamental di<U+FB02>iculty that the conditions under which the solution,
supposing it to be obtained, is analytically valid may not coincide
with the conditions under which the data are possible. It seems
indeed likely—at any rate the evidence of particular examples points
uniformly to the conclusion-——that any attempts to construct the pro
blem upon hypotheses which, while not involved in the actual data are
of the same nature as those data (i. e. which might conceivably have
resulted as facts of observation from the same experience from which
the data were derived), limit the problem, and lead to solutions
which are analytically valid under conditions narrower than those
under which the data are possible.
    But the processes of mathematical logic enable us, without any
addition to the actual data, to effect the required construction of the
problem formally——formally because the hypotheses which are re
garded as ultimate and independent in that construction refer to an
ideal state of things. The nature of the conceptions employed, and
their connexion with the conceptions involved in the actual statement
of the problem, are discussed in the paper.         It is su<U+FB01>icient to say
here that, whatever difficulty there may be in these conceptions as
conceptions, there is nothing arbitrary in the formal procedure of

             Mr. G. Boole on the Theory of Probabilities.               315
 thought with which they are connected.           The probabilities of the
 ideal events enter as auxiliary quantities into the process of solution,
 and disappear by elimination from the <U+FB01>nal result, but they'are
throughout treated as probabilities, and combined according to the
laws of probabilities. I will only say here that the difficulty which
has been felt in the conception of the ideal events appears to me to
 arise from a misdirected attempt to conceive those events by means
of the events in the statement of the problem-—-the true order of
thought being that the events in the statement of the problem are,
not indeed in their material character, but as subjects of probability
and of relations a<U+FB01>'ecting probability, to be conceived by means of
the ideal events.
    Now the probabilities which constitute the actual data will in gene
ral be subject to conditions in order that they may be derived from
actual experience. Those conditions admit of mathematical expres
 sion.
    Generally, if the events in the data are all or any of them compound,
and if pl, pg, . . . p, represent their probabilities, those quantities will
be subject to certain conditions, expressible in the form of linear
equations or inequations, beside the condition that, as representing
probabilities, they must be positive proper fractions. All such condi
tions of either kind are ultimately expressible in the general form

as to indicate that each of the quantities 12,, pg, . . . p, varies between
a system of inferior limits expressed by linear functions of the other
quantities, and a system of superior limits also so expressed.
   Thus, if A, B, C represent any simple events, and if pI represent
the probability of the concurrence of B and C, 122 that of the concur
rence of C and A, p, that of the concurrence of A and B, then pl, pg, p3
must, in order that they may be derived from experience, satisfy the
conditions

as well as the conditions implied in their being positive proper frac
tions.
   On the other hand, the ideal events being by hypothesis simple and
independent, the auxiliary quantities which represent their proba
bilities will be subject to no other condition a‘: priori than that of
being positive proper fractions—to no other condition it priori,
because their actual values are determined in the process of solu
tion.
   Now the most general results of the analytical investigation are-—
    lst. That the auxiliary quantities representing the probabilities of
the ideal events admit of determination as positive proper fractions,
and, further, of a single de<U+FB01>nite determination as such, precisely when
the original data supply the conditions of a possible experience.

 always lie within such limits as it would have had if determined by
 actual observation from the same experience as the data.
    The proof of these propositions rests upon certain general theorems
 relating to the solution of a class of simultaneous algebraic equations,
 and, auxiliary to this, to the properties of a functional determinant.
    The following are the principal of those theorems :-
    lst. If the elements of any symmetrical determinant are all of
 them linear homogeneous functions of certain quantities al, al, . . . a,
——if the coe<U+FB01>icients of these quantities in the terms on the principal
 diagonal of the determinant are all positive—and if, lastly, the coeffi
 cients of any of these quantities in any row of elements are propor
 tional to the corresponding coe<U+FB01>icients of the same quantity in any
 other row, then the determinant developed as a rational and integral

     ‘    ON THE STRATIFICATION OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT.
                           BY M. REITLINGER.
           REITLINGER has proposed, in a note presented to the Aca~
       0 demyof Sciences of Vienna (January 3, 1861), a new explana
 tion of the phenomenon known under the name of the strati<U+FB01>cation of
 the electric light, which he has imagined from some of the results of
 his observations on Geissler's tubes. A great number of these tubes
 are formed with large and narrow portions alternately, and emit differ
 ent colours of light in the two portions when they are traversed by
 an electric discharge. This curious phenomenon has probably been
 perceived by most of those who have experimented on the electric
light. M. von Ettingshausen found that the di<U+FB02>"erent luminous parts
 have totally di<U+FB01>erent constitutions, and intimated to M. Reitlinger
 this particularity as an interesting subject for study.
    In front of a narrow slit, a rectangular prism is placed in a situa
 tion so that the lateral rays of light from some source may so come,
on being re<U+FB02>ected entirely on the hypothenuse face, as to illuminate
the upper half of the slit, while the other half is illuminated by
direct rays from another source.
    It is possible in this manner to compare the spectra of the two
lights and perceive their identity or their differences. M. Reitlinger
 has found that in this manner the spectrum of the narrow parts of an
 undulating tube constructed by Geissler, and sold by him as a
 hydrogen-tube, was the spectrum of pure hydrogen, while the spec
 trum of the larger parts was that of oxygen. The diversity of lights
 consequently was owing to the diversity of the luminous substances ;
 and the passage .of the electricity appeared to separate from one

318             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.‘
another the two mixed gases, at the same time that it rendered them
luminous.
   The presence of oxygen in a hydrogen~tube had probably some
thing to do with its preparation. M. Pliicker has said that it was
possible to use steam for preparing these tubes, and that the passage
of the <U+FB01>rst electric discharges su<U+FB02>iced to place the hydrogen at
liberty: such a separation of mixed gases has appeared to M. Reit
linger to furnish the explanation of the strati<U+FB01>cation of the electric
light. He admits, for instance, that in a tube prepared with steam, the
hydrogen and oxygen dispose themselves in alternate layers; and
that the hydrogen, a much better conductor than the oxygen, is
less heated and becomes less luminous, that is, relatively obscure :
generally speaking, strati<U+FB01>cation would result from the disposition in
alternate layers of two gases unequally conductive.
    let. A tube full of dry air under the pressure of 1'5 millim. gave
a spectrum in which only the rays characteristic of nitrogen were seen,
and which presented not the slightest trace of strati<U+FB01>cation : no very
sensible difference was perceivable between the two wide tubes and
the capillary tube of communication of which the entire apparatus was
formed; the spectrum of the capillary part offered merely some rays
which were wanting in the spectrum of the wider parts.       The intro
duction of a small quantity of pure hydrogen caused the strati<U+FB01>cation
to appear in the wide tubes without sensibly modifying the aspect of
the corresponding spectra.       In the narrow tube no appearance of
stratification was produced at <U+FB01>rst, but to the spectrum of nitrogen
there was superposed a bright spectrum characteristic of hydrogen.
The introduction of hydrogen being continued, and the pressure
raised to 6 millims., the light of the capillary tube became strati<U+FB01>ed
in its turn, and the tube presented somewhat the aspect of a chaplet
 of brilliant pearls.
     2nd. The electric light was developed in the barometrical vacuum,
 the mercury itself supplying the place of one of the electrodes; only
 a white homogeneous light was perceived, without strati<U+FB01>cation. By
 the introduction of some globules of air, there was immediatelyformed
 a series of luminous layers alternately more or less brilliant, but
 without the inequality degenerating into obscurity. A spectrum of
 the light showed at the same time the rays of the mercury and
 that of the air. By regulating properly the intensity of the current
 and the electric force of the introduced air, the layers less brilliant
 can be brought to an almost complete obscurity.
    3rd. With simple gases no strati<U+FB01>cations have been produced.

ON THE EXISTENCE OF A CRYSTALLIZABLE CARBON COMPOUND
   AND FREE SULPHUR IN THE ALAIS METEORITE.                BY PROEESSOR
   ROSCOE.
   Through the kindness of R. P. Greg, Esq., of Manchester, I was
placed in possession of about a gramme and a half of this peculiar
meteorite, which fell near Alais, in France, on March 15, 1806,
and was examined by Berzelius in 1834. This distinguished chemist
states* that the Alais meteorite is remarkable as containing an
organic carbon-compound, soluble in water, which turns brown on
heating, deposits a black carbonaceous mass, and burns without
residue. In the year 1860, W6hler1- discovered the presence of
small traces of a crystallizable hydrocarbon, soluble in alcohol and
 ether, in two meteorites, one of which fell at Kaba, in Hungary, on‘
April 15, 1857, and the other at Bokkevelde, in South Africa, on
 October 13, 1838. The fact thus undoubtedly proved, of the exis
 tence in these two meteorites of crystallizable carbon-compounds,
 which in terrestrial matter are solely the results of vital action,
rendered a further con<U+FB01>rmation of the existence of organic matter in
 the Alais meteorite of special interest.
    In general appearance the small fragments of the meteorite ex
perimented upon coincided exactly with thc minute description of
the substance given by Berzelius: the white e<U+FB02>iorescence which
covers the surface of the mineral was found to consist mainly of
small crystals of sulphate of magnesium; the only other bodies
which could be detected by spectrum analysis were soda and lime.
Iron was not contained in the soluble salts. On extracting 1"O583
gramme of the meteorite with water, 0'll55 gramme of soluble salts
was dissolved, corresponding to 10‘91 per cent., and thus closely
agreeing with Berzelius’s estimation of 103 per cent.
   Ether was found to dissolve from the residue 1'94 per cent. of
the original meteorite, a substance which on evaporation was de
posited in distinct crystals. The crystals possessed a peculiar
aromatic odour, and melted at 114° C., subliming on heating, and
leaving a slight carbonaceous residue.        Under the microcope the
            * Pogg. Ann. vol. xxxiii. p. 113.

crystals were seen to be of two forms, one acicular, the other rhombic.
The acicular crystals were di<U+FB01>icultly soluble in absolute alcohol, but
easily soluble in ether, bisulphide of carbon, turpentine, and cold
nitric acid, and dissolved in sulphuric acid with formation of abrown
colouring-matter; the rhombic crystals likewise dissolved in ether
and bisulphide of carbon, but were unaltered by cold nitric and sul
phuric acids, or turpentine. The ethereal extract gave no reaction
for sulphuric acid; but after boiling with nitric acid, a copious pre
cipitate of sulphate of barium was deposited. When burnt in a
stream of dry oxygen gas, O'OO78 gramme of the extract, dried at
 100° C., yielded 0'010 gramme of sulphurous acid, 0'008 gramme of
carbonic acid, and O'0O3 gramme of water. Hence the meteorite
contained 1'24 per cent. of free sulphur, 0'54 per cent. of carbon,
and 0'} per cent. of hydrogen, in a form soluble in ether. The
meteorite contains a considerable quantity of carbon (probably as
graphite) which is insoluble in ether. The total percentage of
carbon found on igniting the meteorite in oxygen amounted to 3'36
per cent. ; this closely corresponds with the amount found by B€l'Z€
lius, viz. 3'05 per cent.
   From the above it is evident that the Alais meteorite contains
at least a half per cent. of a hydrocarbon which is deposited in
acicular crystals when the mass is treated with ether, together with
considerable quantities (more than 1 per cent.) of free sulphur,
crystallizing from the ethereal solution in rhombic octahedra. To
judge by the melting-point, the hydrocarbon may be analogous to a
mineral wax called Kiinlite, discovered by Kraus in the lignite of
Uznach, which contains an equal number of atoms of carbon and
hydrogen, and melts at 114° C.-—Pr0ceedings of the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Manchester, February 24, 1863.
       ON A NEW AND EXTREMELY SENSITIVE THERMOMETER.
                         BY DR. JOULE, F.R.S
   Some years agol remarked the disturbing in<U+FB02>uence of currents
of air on <U+FB01>nely suspended magnetic needles, and suggested that it
might be made use of as a delicate test of temperature.    I have lately
carried out the idea into practice, and have obtained results beyond
my expectation. A glass vessel in the shape of a tube, 2 feet long
and 4 inches in diameter, was divided longitudinally by a blackened
pasteboard diaphragm, leaving spaces at the top and bottom, each a
little over 1 inch. In the top space a bit of magnetized sewing
needle, furnished with a glass index, is suspended by a single <U+FB01>lament
 of silk. It is evident that the arrangement is similar to that of a
" bratticed " coal-pit shaft, and that the slightest excess of tempera
tnre on one side over that on the other must occasion a circulation
 of air, which will ascend on the heated side, and, after passing across
 the <U+FB01>ne glass index, descend on the other side. It is also evident
 that the sensibility of the instrument may be increased to any re
 quired extent, by diminishing the directive force of the magnetic
 needle. I purpose to make several improvements in my present

instrument; but in its present condition the heat radiated by a small
pan, containing a pint of water heated 30°, is quite perceptible at a
distance of three yards. A further proof of the extreme sensibility
of the instrument is obtained from the fact that it is able to detect
the heat radiated by the moon. A beam of moonlight was admitted
through a slit in a shutter. As the moon (nearly full) travelled from
left to right the beam passed gradually across the instrument,
causing the index to be de<U+FB02>ected several degrees, <U+FB01>rst to the left and
then to the right. The effect showed, according to a very rough
estimate, that the air in the instrument must have been heated by
the moon's rays a few ten-thousandths of a degree, or by a quantity
no doubt the equivalent of the light absorbed by the blackened sur
face on which the rays fell.—Proceedings of the Literary and Philo

          ON THE MOTION OF VAPOURS TOWARD THE COLD.
                       BY THOMAS WOODS, M.D.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
    In some of the late numbers of your Magazine I perceive there is
a discussion between Dr. Draper and Mr. Tomlinson as to priority
of the true explanation of the cause of the motion of certain volatile
substances towards the light. It is very remarkable how often
scienti<U+FB01>c men dispute priority of invention or discovery, and claim
it with the most sincere belief in the truth of their statements.
These disputes would form an interesting chapter in the curiosities
of scienti<U+FB01>c literature. I believe these claims arise from want of
 sufficient attention on the part of the disputants to their true posi
 tion. For instance, one man devotes much time to a particular
 pursuit, and arrives at certain broad principles which satisfy him.
 Another, perhaps years after, happening to work out some part of
 the same investigation in detail, publishes as an independent dis
 covery what might, when it is known, be deduced from the researches
of his predecessor, but which would for ever be a dead letter were it
not for his labour. The philosopher who was <U+FB01>rst in the <U+FB01>eld, how
ever, is astonished (unjustly, I think) that any discovery should be .
claimed ; and hence many of these disputes.
    Dr. Joule and myself were, I believe, somewhat in this predica
ment with respect to the heat absorbed by the decomposition of
compounds*; and I fancy such désagréments will constantly be
occurring, and not altogether without bene<U+FB01>t to the public, as every
detail is so fully and prominently brought out.                      _
    I make these remarks because, if Mr. Tomlinson had delayed
another month to publish his ideas on “the motion of camphor
                        * Phil. Mag., 1856. vol. xii.

  towards the light,” I might have also laid claim to the explanation,
  .as Ihappened to be engaged in a course of experiments to illustrate
  the proposition he proved. My reason for alluding to the‘ subject
  now is that I may mention an hitherto undervalued fact which I
   observed during their progress.
      I commenced my research with the idea that it might possibly
   happen that Light would act as a sort of analyser, separating vola
   tile substances from each other.     I fancied, for instance, if camphor
   moved towards the light, other volatile matters might move in an
   opposite direction, or that certain circumstances might determine
   such a course. It would be useless to mention any of the substances
   I experimented on, or the circumtances in which I placed them, as
   I ultimately came to the conclusion that light was not the moving
   power at all, but temperature.
      During these trials I dissolved, in a saturated solution of camphor
   in alcohol, some iodine, so as to colour it darkly; and having ex
  posed a little of this mixture in a corked <U+FB02>at phial in a window, I
   found that on whichever side was the warmer the coloured <U+FB02>uid rose
  by capillary attraction, and on that side only. With other coloured
  <U+FB02>uids I observed the same action ; and I found, in fact, that I had. a
  most sensitive differential thermometer, for no matter how slight
   the difference of temperature of the sides, although inappreciable to
  the most delicate thermometer, the capillary attraction caused a rise
  of the liquid on the side of the vessel which was nearer to the heat,
  and the height attained seemed to be in proportion to the difference
   of temperature.
      If vapour of water he in the phia1— a condition easily brought about
  by placing a drop or two of this <U+FB02>uid on the side of the vessel
  within, not mixing them with the spirit,—it will always be deposited
   on the side opposite to that on which the rise of <U+FB02>uid by capillary
  attraction takes place, no matter how the light falls on the bottle ;
  showing, of course, that the cold surface condenses the vapour, and
  the hot one causes the <U+FB02>uid to rise.
      And when we consider that the sides of the phial containing the
  coloured <U+FB02>uid and enclosing the vapour are only about half an inch
  apart, and that the vessel is placed where no difference of temperature
  of its sides apparently exists, we are tempted to think that the
  vapour is condensed more in the direction than in the actual presence
  of the cold, while the coloured <U+FB02>uid is raised in the opposite—radia
' tion having more to do with the phenomena than sensible di<U+FB02>ierence
  of temperature.
      However this may be, the delicacy of this simple contrivance (a
  <U+FB02>at corked phial, in which is contained a little coloured spirituous
  liquid and vapour of water) for showing difference of temperature in
  opposite points is remarkable, and might, I think, be taken advan
  tage of in meteorological investigations.
      When the <U+FB02>uid is raised, and the vapour deposited, if the vessel
  is turned round so as to reverse the aspect of the sides, the <U+FB02>uid
  entirely leaves the side now pointing to the colder region, and rises

     ON SOME SPECIMENS OF PSEUDOMORPHS IN THE IMPERIAL
            MUSEUM OF VIENNA*.          BY DR. TSCHERMAK.
    The Imperial Museum of Vienna contains many very curious
 specimens of Pseudomorphs, and among them are several calculated
to throw light on controverted geological questions.         In a hand
specimen of gneiss from the Rathhaus-Berg, near Gastein, amphi
bole has replaced mica. This gneiss contains altered amphibole in
the interior of masses of mica; and it may therefore be inferred,
with a certain degree of probability, that the whole of this gneiss,
whose felspathic components likewise bear traces of metamorphism,
is an altered amphibolic rock. The same, so far as may be inferred
 from cabinet-specimens, may be the case with other varieties of
gneiss, especially with those of Brazil.
    Pseudomorphs of compact felspar, replacing crystals of the same
 mineral species, occur in the antique green porphyry of Italy and
 Egypt, as also in the diabasic porphyry from the Hartz,—a fact
 not unimportant in regard to the origin of certain varieties of this
 group of rocks. A double Pseudomorph—crystallized gypsum meta
 morphosed into <U+FB01>brous gypsum, and this, in the course of time, into
 <U+FB01>brous quartz——occurring, together with spaces left by the decom
 position of crystallized iron pyrites, in a specimen of chloritic argil
 laceous slate from the Eifel, may suggest some of the processes
 undergone by this rock before it arrived at its present condition.
 Some other cases of Pseudomorphs, as specular oxide of iron re
 placing olivine in the trappean rocks around Edinburgh; opal re
 placing nephrite, from Elbingerode; opal replacing augite, from the
 same locality; and calcareous spar having taken the place of augite
 in the metamorphosed pyroxenic porphyry of Tokoré (Transylvania),
 have been neither noticed nor described before.—-Proc. Imp. Acad.

gigantolite, or chlorophyllite. Their completely crystallized portion
is in immediate contact with greyish-white diaphanous quartz. The
planes by which they are in contact with the orthoclasic matrix are
irregular and not well de<U+FB01>ned. In their interior the whole of the
cordierite has been metamorphosed into mica, whose lamellae lie
parallel to the surface of the crystals.         Chev. G. von Hauer, who has

XLIV. Account of some Experiments showing the Change of Rate
  produced in a Clock by a particular case of Magnetic Action.
   B_z/WILLIAM ELLIs,Esq., ofthe Royal Observatory, Greenwic/t*.
HAVING made a series of experiments, the particular object
   -    of which was to ascertain whether it would be possible
easily to change permanently the rate of a clock by the action of
magnets, and so avoid the necessity of touching its pendulum
screw, I have been requested by the Astronomer Royal to draw
up an account of these experiments, since the results appear to
possess some features which are in themselves likely to be inter
esting generally, independently of the possible practical applica
tion of the principle.  The account is not, however, offered as
containing anything which adds in any important degree to fun
damental laws already known, but chie<U+FB02>y because the experi
ments so well illustrate the peculiar action of two magnets on
each other when brought very near together.
   The clock made use of for trial of the principle was one of the
spare clocks at the Royal Observatory—-one whose pendulum,
vibrating seconds, consisted of a wooden rod <U+FB01>tted with a lenti
cular-shaped bob of lead. Near the lower end of the pendulum
rod there was <U+FB01>xed a permanent bar magnet, in a vertical posi
tion. Above this, and supported by the clock-case, there was
<U+FB01>xed another magnet, entirely similar, also in a vertical posi
tion, and so placed that, when the pendulum-rod was at rest, the
lower end of the <U+FB01>xed magnet was precisely over the upper end
of the pendulum-magnet. The broad part of the magnets was
towards the front. The clock-rate having been found with the
pendulum-magnet only in position, the <U+FB01>xed magnet was then
added, and the rate determined with this magnet placed at dif
ferent distances above the pendulum-magnet. The clock was
rated with the poles of each magnet in reversed positions with

 326       Mr. W. Ellis on the Change of Rule produced in (1 Clock
 respect to the other magnet, giving four sets of observations.
 Between each set and again at the completion of the observations,
 the clock-rate was determined with the pendulum-magnet
 only in position: these determinations of the clock’s normal
 rate were very satisfactory as respects steadiness of rate: the
 changes produced by the action of the magnets on each other,
 as exhibited in the following Table, may therefore be considered
 (for the magnets used) very exact. When the adjacent poles of
 the two magnets were similar, the effect of the repulsion retarded
 the clock; when the adjacent poles were unlike, the effect of
 the attraction accelerated the clock. In the following Table is
 given the increase or decrease of hourly gaining rate for every
 position of magnets and distance of magnets tried, with the cor
 responding total are of vibration :—

   It is to be understood that the arc of vibration given in the
foregoing Table is the total are reckoning from the extreme limit
of vibration of the pendulum on one side of the perpendicular
to its extreme limit on the opposite side. The amount of are
when no magnetic action existed (that is, with the pendulum

                 by a particular case of Magnetic Action.                                     327
magnet only in position) was 4° 38'. As respects change of the arc,
it will be noticed that, as the distance is decreased, there is a
marked decrease of are when the magnets attract, but a very
slight tendency to increase when the magnets repel.
   As respects change of rate, it appears, for a given distance of
magnets, that when the adjacent poles were similar, the clock
was not retarded to the same extent to which it was accelerated
when the poles were unlike. The ratio between the two appears
to be somewhat similar to the ratio between the two correspond
ing changes of are noticed above.
   It will be seen that the distances between the magnets in the
different trials were not the same: the <U+FB01>xed magnet was placed
at about the desired distance from the pendulum-magnet, and
the exact distance afterwards accurately measured. In conse
quence of this a direct comparison of results for a given distance
is not possible with the numbers only as given in the preceding
Table. To obtain such comparison, the numbers of that Table
were laid down graphically, taking the distance of magnets for
abscissa, and change of rate as ordinate: curves were then
drawn to include all the points. The following Table contains
the numbers read 011' from these curves 2-

328    Mr. W. Ellis on the Change of Rate produced in a Clock
   The last two columns of the preceding Table show, for the
magnets used, the mean effect of attraction and the mean effect
of repulsion. Con<U+FB01>ning our attention to these numbers, we
perceive how rapidly the change due to attraction accelerates as
the distance between the magnets is decreased, whilst that due
to repulsion advances only by small increments. This is, how
ever, a natural result of the known action of magnets; for when
the poles of two magnetsare brought near together, each one
tends to develope or induce in the other an opposite magnetism,
which may combine with or act against the magnetism already
existing therein. So that when the poles are unlike, the total
force in action is the sum of two e<U+FB01>'ects—-one depending on the
permanent magnetisms, which is attractive, the other on the
induced magnetisms, which is also attractive; the total force is
consequently attractive and strong.        But when the poles are
similar, the total force in action is the difference of two e<U+FB02>'ects——
one (probably always the larger when the magnets are equal in
size and similar in constitution) depending on the permanent
magnetisms, which is repulsive, the other on the induced mag
netisms, which is, as before, attractive; and under such condi
tions the total force is repulsive but weak. Had, however, one
of the magnets been much larger than the other, it might have
happened, when similar poles were brought near together, that
the repulsive part of the force (depending on the permanent
magnetisms) might have been less than the attractive part
(depending on the induced magnetisms), giving not a total
repulsive force at all, but an attractive force which might be
weak or strong according to the relative difference in size and
constitution of the two magnets.        ‘
   If, in the two cases considered above, the e<U+FB02>'ect of induction
in the one case, when the poles were unlike, may be considered
equal to its effect in the other case, when the poles were similar,
the half sum of the numbers contained in the last two columns
of the preceding Table (taken without regard to sign) will give
 the change of" rate due to the permanent magnetism ; and the
half difference (similarly without regard to sign) will give the
 change due to the induced magnetism. Numbers formed in
this manner for all the different values of distance are given in
the following Table, P denoting the change due to permanent
 magnetism (attractive, and increasing the gaining rate, for unlike
poles; repulsive, and decreasing the rate, for similar poles), I
denoting the change due to induced magnetism (always attrac
tive and increasing the rate) :

        It will be noticed in the above Table how rapidly the values
of I diminish for increase of distance as compared with the values
of P, the inductive action becoming much sooner comparatively
insigni<U+FB01>cant. And the ratio of change as regards distance varies
considerably, as will be seen by the following numbers selected
from the Table last given :—

         The general character of the variations is so much more
strikingly seen when the results are thrown into the shape of

   In the above diagram the upper of the strong curved lines
shows the total change produced by attraction, the lower the
total change produced by repulsion: they are formed from the
sixth and seventh columns of the second Table. The dotted lines,
which on the right-hand side of the diagram are lost in the
strong lines, represent the values of P, as given in the third
Table. The length of ordinate between the dotted line and the
strong line in each case represents the effect of I as contained
in the same Table: this combined with P, bending P upwards in
both cases, produces the results indicated by the strong lines.
   It remains to be stated that the length of the clock-pendulum
to the effective end of the pendulum-magnet (the upper end) was
33'25 inches; also that the centre of the magnet in that part
swung to 1'34 inch on each side of the perpendicular, correspond
ing to a total are of 4° 38'. This is the normal arc,with the pendu
lum-magnet only in position. With both magnets in position
and magnetic action existing, the extent of swing, if required,
can be inferred from the numbers given in the last two columns
of the <U+FB01>rst Table. The total weight of the pendulum as <U+FB01>tted
with its magnet was 7 lbs. 14 oz. avoirdupois.                     '
   The magnets were similar in size, their dimensions being,
length 5'6 inches, breadth 0'6 inch, and thickness 0'13 inch. The
following observations of the de<U+FB02>ection of two light pocket com
pass-needles by the magnets may give an idea of their strength.
The magnets were placed in an east and west direction, and in
reversed positions of poles, both on the east side and on the west
side of the compass-needles. Each of the following numbers is
consequently the mean of four observations. Needle A is the
heavier :—             -

   The pendulum-magnet appears to be stronger than the other.
   As respects the possible application of the principle now
treated of to the special object of changing the rate of a clock,
it will be understood that, in such application, means must be
provided for delicately moving in a vertical direction the magnet
corresponding to that here called the <U+FB01>xed magnet: then the

magnets being mounted, and the clock once adjusted to time by
the pendulum screw, any future change of rate may be counter
acted by advancing or withdrawing the <U+FB01>xed magnet through a
very small space. The magnets should not be placed too near
together, for which, indeed, there is no necessity, as a quite
su<U+FB02>icient amount of action may he commanded even when they
are separated by a comparatively large distance.

XLV. Experimental Researches on the Laws of Evaporation and
                  Absorption. By T. TATE, Esq.
                   [Concluded from vol. xxiii. p. 289.]
               On the Cooling E<U+FB02>eets of Evaporation.
l. DALTON determined the amount of evaporation from
            liquids at different temperatures. Now the object of
the present inquiry is to determine the cooling effects produced
by the evaporation of liquids at different temperatures. The
following law of cooling seems to be fairly established by the expe
riments.
  The cooling efect of the evaporation of liquids, at a constant atmo
-spheric pressure, varies as the‘ tension of the vapour at the given
temperature multiplied by the latent heat of the vapour at that
temperature.
   Thus, let 1: = the rate of cooling per minute, estimated in
degrees of the thermometer at T temperature, p pressure of
vapour, and L latent heat of vapour at that temperature; v,=
the rate of cooling of the same or any other liquid at T1 tempe
rature, p1 pressure of vapour, and L1 latent heat of vapour;

    Experiment I. A tin canister, clothed with woollen cloth, and
<U+FB01>lled with hot water, had its mouth closed by a perforated cork
through which a thermometer passed into the centre of the hot
water. The whole was suspended in the air, and the intervals
of time requisite to cool down the thermometer every successive
ten degrees were noted, <U+FB01>rst when the woollen cloth was dry, and
second when it was damped with water. In the <U+FB01>rst case the
rate of cooling due to radiation alone was found, and in the
second case the rate of cooling due to radiation and evaporation
was found, the difference of these giving the rate of cooling due
to evaporation alone. The experiments were made when the air

332            Mr. T. Tate’s E:vperimental Researches on the
was unusually dry, the temperature being 53° ; so that the vapo
rization, considering the elevation of the temperature of the water
above that of the surrounding air, might be regarded as taking
place in dry air.

     The values of L are calculated from Regnault’s formula for
 the latent heat of steam, viz. L=1082—'695T; thus for the
 temperature 175°, _we <U+FB01>nd L=1082-"695 x 175=960'375 ;
 and so on for other temperatures. The near coincidence of the
 results in the sixth and eighth columns shows that the cooling
 effect of the evaporation of water nearly varies as the product
 of the tension of the vapour and the latent heat of that vapour.
 This result was also veri<U+FB01>ed in the following manner.
     Eaperiment II. Two tin canisters were made of the same
 form and capacity; but the one was closed at the top, as in the
 foregoing experiments, whilst the other was open at the top.
 They were <U+FB01>lled with the same quantity of hot water and exposed
 to the atmosphere, and the times of cooling, &c., were noted as
 before. In this case, presuming the radiation from the surface of
 the water to be the same as the radiation from the corresponding
 surface of the tin, the difference between the corresponding rates
 of cooling obviously gives us the rate of cooling due to evapora
 tion alone. In this experiment the observations were made at
 intervals of 5° Centigrade.

    The values of‘L are taken in degrees Fahrenheit, as in the
foregoing Table of results. The near coincidence of the results
in the sixth and eighth columns con<U+FB01>rms the law above enun
ciated.
    The following series of experiments not only verify this law,
but also determine the maximum depression of temperature
produced by the evaporation of water in dry air of a given tem
perature.
    Experiment III. A large wide-mouthed bottle, containing a
portion of strong sulphuric acid, had its mouth closed by a per
forated cork having the stem of a delicate thermometer passing
through it. The thermometer was graduated into tenths of a
degree Centigrade; and having an elongated bulb, a calico cap
could be readily slipped on or taken o<U+FB01>' the bulb as required. By
agitating the sulphuric acid, the air in the bottle was dried or
deprived of all watery vapour. The temperature of the air being
<U+FB01>rst ascertained by the naked bulb of the thermometer, the bulb
of the thermometer with its calico cap moistened with water
slightly above the atmospheric temperature was placed in the
bottle, and the rate of cooling, &c., were carefully noted.                                              The
rate of cooling, given in the second column of the following
Table of results, is the number of degrees, or parts of a degree,
which the thermometer fell per minute below the atmospheric
temperature.

    Here the near coincidence of the results given in the second
and seventh columns shows that the rate of cooling, by the eva
poration qf water, varies as the tension of vapour at the given tem
perature, the comparatively small differences of the latent. heat
in this case being neglected. Again, the near coincidence of the
results given in the third and eighth columns shows that for
mula (1) very nearly represents the maximum depression. This
formula is derived from theoretical reasoning, in the following
manner.
    At the point of maximum depression, the rate of cooling by
evaporation must be equal to the rate of heating due to radiation.
Now the rate of cooling varies as pl, the tension of vapour at the
corresponding temperature ; but by Dulong and Petit’s formula
the rate of radiation varies as 1'OO77T (1‘0O77D- 1) ; therefore
at the point of maximum depression we have
                                      1'OO77T (l'0077D—l)=ap,,
where a is a constant, which we <U+FB01>nd by elimination to be '265.

An approximate value of D may be found in the following man
ner. Putting 1+e for 10077, we <U+FB01>nd by development, and

    Experiment IV. VVhen the temperature of the air was 12° C.,
the evaporation of ether caused the thermometer to fall at the

               Laws of Evaporation and Absorption.              335
rate of 6°'85 per minute; whilst that of water, in dry air at
the same temperature, produced a fall of 1°'33 per minute.

Hence we have for the ratio of the velocities ; = 1-<U+FB01>g
Now the tension P of the vapour of ether at 12° is 12243, and
that of water at the same temperature is p='4~10i. Moreover,
taking the latent heat of the vapours of ether and water for equal
weights to be 168 or L, and 1000 or 1 respectively, we have
                 P >< L_ 12-243 X 168

    Other things being the same, it may be presumed that the
cooling effect of evaporation varies inversely as the density or
pressure of the air.
Heating Efects produced by the Absorption of Vapour by Dry
    Substances, (Eye. from an Atmosphere saturated with Vapour.
   2. As evaporation produces cold, so the condensation of vapour,
from whatever cause, produces heat. The force with which dry
substances (such as woollen, cotton, and other textile fabrics)
attract and condense the vapour of water is so great as, under
favourable circumstances, to raise the temperature of a thermo
meter 30° F. Acting in this manner, I have found that the
heating power of dry woollen cloth is as great as any other sub
stance, being about the same as that of fused chloride of calcium.
The heat developed not only depends on the quantity of the sub
stance used, but also on the temperature of the air at the time,
as shown by the following experiments.
    The heatproduced by the absorption of vapour, by dry substances,
is proportional to the tension of the vapour.
    Eaperiment V. A double roll of woollen cloth was <U+FB01>tted as a
cap to the bulb of the thermometer before described, and inserted
in the sulphuric-acid bottle described in Experiment III., where
it was allowed to remain for some hours. The cork of this ther
mometer <U+FB01>tted the mouth of a large humid-air bottle containing
<U+FB01>fteen half-pints, in which a portion of water was placed. By
occasionally agitating the water of this bottle and allowing it to

    336            Mr. T. Tate’s Experimental Researches on the
    stand closed for some hours, the air in it became fully saturated
    with the vapour of the water at the given temperature. The
    thermometer with its dry woollen .cap was then placed in the
    humid-air bottle, and the rates of augmentation of temperature,
   &c., were duly observed.

  perature. Also, the near coincidence of the results given in the
    third and sixth columns shows that, within this range of tempe
   rature, the maximum augmentation of temperature is in the geome
    trical ratio qf the temperature. This remarkable result admits of
    the following theoretical exposition.

    eliminating the constants c and e, we <U+FB01>nd E=5'l5 x 1'O512T.
       3. The maximum augmentation of temperature was found to
    be affected by the thickness of the material; thus a single fold
' of woollen cloth at the temperature of 11° gave an augmentation
    of only 6°, whilst the double fold gave 9° ; again, the single fold
    at the temperature of 20° gave an augmentation of 9°, whilst the
    double fold gave 14°. This double fold, for ordinary tempera
    tures, was found to give the maximum effect.                              Also a single
    fold of calico at 14° gave an augmentation of 4°'6, whilst the
    double fold gave 5°'8.
       4. As the ratio? is constant for all temperatures, a thermo

                 Laws of Evaporation and Absorption.               337
meter with a dry cap may be advantageously used as a hygro
meter. Putting v‘ for the velocity of augmentation per minute,
when the thermometer with its dry cap is exposed to air whose
vapour has the tension 1;’, then p'=av', where the constant
a=‘;—7 = the ratio of the velocity of augmentation, in air satu
rated with vapour, to the tension of that vapour.
   5. The same principle was found to hold true in relation to
certain hydrated salts, and other compounds having an af<U+FB01>nity
for watery vapour.
   Ezperiment VI. In these experiments the salt was deposited
on the bulb of the thermometer by repeatedly dippingit in a hot
saturated solution of the salt and then placing the thermometer
in the dry-air bottle, where it was allowed to remain until the
salt was thoroughly dried.      The bulb with the dry salt upon it
was then placed in the humid-air bottle, and the velocity of
augmentation of temperature per minute, as well as the maxi
mum augmentation, &c., were observed as before.             As in the
case of the woollen cloth cap, the maximum effect depends on
the quantity of the salt deposited on the bulb; but by using the
same quantity in each cries of experiments, the results admit of
being compared with one another.
   The results of experiment with chloride of calcium were as
follows :
   At the temperature of 19° C., the rate of augmentation per
minute 21 was found to be 4°, and the maximum augmentation
E was found to be 13°'3. The temperature being variable, the
rate of augmentation was found to be expressed by the formula
12:6}p, and the maximum augmentation by
                     E __ 25'3p __ 4-6 X 1-057T.
                       _ 1'011T _
   The maximum augmentation, in degrees Centigrade, of the
following substances was found at mean temperature (15° C.) as
follows :——
   Potassa, 10°; chloride of zinc, 7°11; nitrate of lime, 7°;
sulphuric acid, 12°'6; oxalic acid, 6°; sulphate of copper, 6°;
chloride of sodium, 5°; carbonate of soda, 5?; charcoal, 4°'6;
sulphate of soda, 4°'5 ; nitrate of ammonia, 4-°'4; oxalate of
lime, -’-L°'3 ; sugar, 3°; plaster of paris, 3° ; starch, 2° ; tartaric
acid, 2°.      These numbers probably express the relative force
with which the respective substances attract watery vapour.
   Charcoal in ammoniacal vapour gave an augmentation of
22° C., or 39°'4 F. ; and plaster of paris in the same vapour
gave 20° C., or 36° F.

  338        Mr. T. Tate’s Experimental Researches on the
    On the Amount of Vapour absorbed at di<U+FB01>erent Temperatures.
     6. The weight of vapour absorbed by an absorbent in a given
 time from an atmosphere charged with watery vapour is propor
 tional to the tension of the vapour.
    Ezperiment VII. A jar (J), 5 inches section, containing strong
 sulphuric acid, was covered with a plate
 P, having a portion cut out, of the same
 section as the interior of the jar; a
 damp cloth was laid on this plate, and
 the whole was covered by a large re
 ceiver (R) standing on a tray contain
 ing water. After remaining for twelve
 hours at a uniform temperature, the
 augmentation of weight of the jar and
 acid was ascertained, which gave the
 weight of the vapour absorbed by the
 acid in that time at the observed temperature. The following
 Table gives the augmentations of weight corresponding to dif

    The near coincidence of the results given in the second and
fourth columns shows that the weight of vapour absorbed by the
acid, in a given time, is nearly proportional to the tension of the
vapour at the given temperature.
   At <U+FB01>rst sight it may seem that the amount of vapour here
diffused is very small; but if we convert the weight of water
absorbed into watery vapour at the given temperature, we
shall <U+FB01>nd that the volume of vapour is really something consider
able. Thus we <U+FB01>nd that ] grain of water at 12°-5 produces
about 450 cubic inches of vapour, so that the volume of va
pour, at this temperature, diffused per hour, from a unit of
surface through a unit of distance, would be about 120 cubic
inches.
   7. In like manner, it was found that a dry clean woollen
cloth, placed in an atmosphere saturated with watery vapour,
absorbed in equal times a weight of moisture proportional to

                 Laws of Evaporation and Absorption.                      339
the tension of the vapour. But it was found that the maximum
weight of moisture absorbed was the same, or very nearly the
same, for all temperatures or tensions of vapour. Thus a piece
of clean woollen cloth, weighing 398 grains when perfectly dry,
absorbed 92'5 grains of moisture from an atmosphere saturated
with vapour at 15° C. ; whereas at 5° C. the weight of moisture
absorbed was 9l'4~ grains. Moreover, it was found that, when
this cloth was exposed to the air, the weight of moisture absorbed
(approximately) varied directly as the tension of the vapour in
the air at the time, and inversely as the tension of the vapour
of saturation, as expressed in the formulaw=922,-. Thus, when
the temperature of the air was 9° C., and the tension of its
vapour, as determined by Daniell’s hygrometer, was '26, the
weight w of the moisture absorbed by the cloth was found to
be 706 grains; but by the formula we <U+FB01>nd w=92 X _—;%%= 709.
Again, when the temperature was l4°'8 C., and the tension of
the vapour p’ was '31, the weight w was found to be 59 grains ;
but by the formula w=92x%=58'2.                           When p'=p, then
w=92, which is the weight of the maximum absorption, as
before given. Hence it would appear that a piece of clean
woollen cloth might be used as a hygrometer, probably giving
nearly as reliable results as the ordinary form of the wet- and dry
bulb thermometers. Thus we should have p'= '1’ , the constant
                                                                a

340        Mr. T. Tate’s Experimental Researches on the
    Here the near coincidence of the results given in the second
and third columns, shows that the weight of vapour diffused
 through the different columns of air in the same time is very
 nearly inversely as the depths of these columns. In this re
 spect the law of diffusion of vapour through air is similar to
 the diffusion of a liquid through the pores of an absorbent.
    It has been shown, the atmospheric column being constant
 and the temperature variable, that the amount of vapour dif
fused is proportional to the tension of the vapour at that particular
temperature; hence we conclude that the amount of vapour di -
fused varies directly as the tension of the vapour at the given
temperature, and inversely as the depth of the column of air
through which the vapour has to pass.
    9. The time in which a given volume of dry air becomes satu
rated with vapour (or saturated within a given relative degree)
is nearly independent of the temperature, the source of vapour
 being constant.
    Experiment IX.—A large bottle, containing <U+FB01>fteen half-pints,
 was provided with a thermometer, as in Experiment III. The
 air in the bottle was dried in the following manner :—The bottle
 A, containing the air to be dried, was provided
with a cork <U+FB01>tting the mouth of the bottle C,
 containing a considerable portion of strong
 sulphuric acid, as shown in the diagram. The
 apparatus remained in this state for several
 hours, the acid being occasionally agitated to
 secure the absorption of all the watery vapour
 in the air.   The thermometer, with a damp
 calico cap upon its bulb, was then placed in          W
 this dry-air bottle, and the times correspond         ***—
 ing to different points of depression were duly
 observed. After the maximum point of depression had been
 attained, the thermometer gradually rose until the air in the
 bottle became saturated with vapour, and then the temperature
 became the same as the surrounding air. It is presumed that
 the temperature indicated by the thermometer in the bottle,
 towards the close of the experiment, corresponds with the rate
 of evaporation going on from the damp calico, and therefore be-'
 comes a measure of the degree of saturation of the air in the
 bottle at the instant of observation. The following are the
 results of two experiments at the temperatures of 7° and 13° C.
    At 7° the maximum depression was found to be 3°'2, the
 corresponding time being 8'5 minutes; the times correspond
 ing to O°'9 and O°'6 below the temperature of saturation were
 found to be 70 and 90 minutes respectively.
    At 13° the maximum depression was found to be 5°, the

                Laws ofEvaporation and Absorption.            341
corresponding time being 7'5 minutes ,- the times corresponding
to O°'9 and O°'6 below the temperature of saturation were found
to be 73 and 92 minutes respectively.
   Here it will be observed that the times for the same di
stance from the point of saturation nearly coincide with each
other. It will be further observed that the maximum depres
sions are pretty nearly as the tensions of the vapour at the re
spective temperatures.
   The rationale of this result would appear to be this : whilst
the rate of diffusion increases as the tension of the vapour at
the particular temperature, at the same time the amount of
vapour to be diffused also increases according to the same law.
Assuming that the rate of evaporation, v, varies as p—p', we
have

              I                              '            P
   Now if Ii=a constant, then T=a constant; that is, the
           17
times of diffusion are equal for equal degrees of saturation.
When p’ =p, T= G ; that is, theoretically the time of complete
saturation is in<U+FB01>nite ; but practically the time requisite to
saturate the air within asmall limit is de<U+FB01>nite.
   10. The times in which di<U+FB01>erent volumes of dry air become .811
turated with watery vapour (or saturated within a given relative
degree) are nearly proportional to the volumes.
   Experiment X.-—The foregoing experiment was performed
with a bottle containing three half-pints ; that is, in this case
the volume of the air was one-<U+FB01>fth of the volume of the air in
the last experiment.
   The temperature being 13° C., the maximum depression was
found to be 2°'3, the time being 4 minutes, and the time cor
responding to O°'6 below the temperature of saturation was
found to be -18 minutes, whereas for <U+FB01>ve times the volume of
air it was found to be 92 minutes, that is, nearly <U+FB01>ve times the
time.
   If water be placed at the bottom of a deep open jar, without
soiling the sides, the humidity of the air within the jar, after it
has stood for several hours, is nearly uniform, and only slightly
in excess of that of the external air.
   Experiment XI.—The jar used in this experiment was 18
inches in depth and 4.15} inches in diameter. After the jar had
stood, with the water covering its bottom, for three hours, the
temperatures at the bottom, at the middle, and at the top of the
jar were found, by means of a thermometer with the naked
bulb, to be 13°'6, 13°'6, and 13°'5 C. respectively. The wet

bulb thermometer was then inserted, and the depressions were
found as follows :—at the top 2°'4, at the middle 2°11, and
at the bottom 2°'2. Hence by Glaisher’s factors we <U+FB01>nd
the differences between the temperature of the air and the
temperatures at the dew-points to be 4°'6, 4°'6, and 4°'2
respectively.
    A cover being placed upon the jar, it was allowed to stand
for four hours, and then it was found that the whole of the air
in the jar had become saturated with vapour; for then the wet
bulb thermometer indicated the same temperature as the naked
bulb. The cover was then taken off, and after the lapse of
 15 minutes it was found that nearly the whole of the vapour
in the jar had become diffused in the atmosphere in that time;
showing that vapour already formed di_<U+FB02>"uses itself in the atmo
sphere much more rapidly than it is formed from the surface of
the water. In the former case no change of speci<U+FB01>c heat takes
place, whereas in the latter case there is a great change of
speci<U+FB01>c heat in the passage of the liquid to the state of vapour,
which tends to retard the process of vaporization. These results
explain the following phenomena: if the covered jar be left
over night, a copious deposit of dew will be found on the sides
of the jar ,- but, on the contrary, if the cover be off, no dew will
be formed.

XLVI. On the Motions of Camphor towards the Light, and on
    Variations in the Fixed Lines ofthe Solar Spectrum. By JOHN
   WILLIAM DRAPER, Professor of Chemistry and Physiology in the
    University of New York.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
IT has so happened that I have not seen the February Number
       of the Philosophical Magazine until today.
   I regret to <U+FB01>nd that Mr. Tomlinson has not frankly done
me the justice which was due, as respects the explanation of
the motions of camphor to the light, but has endeavoured to
strengthen his case by, as I trust, an unconscious misstate
ment of dates.
    Mr. Tomlinson admits that I published in the Philosophical
Magazine for February 1840, the true explanation of these mo
tions—-—that camphor crystallizes on the side of a glass vessel
nearest the sun because that side is the coldest.    He endeavours,
however, to show that I had so little faith in this explanation, as
to publish in 1844’ other experiments to prove that it is incorrect.

and on Variations in the Fired Lines of the Solar Spectrum.        343
   But Mr. Tomlinson knows better than this. He sees on page
99          the top ofofthe
     of the Appendix
lineifrom                      bookthat
                          thepage,      the quoted,
                                    he has          and inhethe
                                             experiments        fourth
                                                             refers to,
and the paragraphs he quotes, were published, not in 1844, as
he would have his readers suppose, but in 1837, in the Journal
of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia for June, July, August,
and September of that year. They are not later contradictions
of the true explanation given in 18410, but the Btl7‘l281‘ steps by
which that conclusion was gradually reached. They were pub
lished, not four years subsequently, but three years previously to
the correct explanation.                             '
   I have made no new experiments on these camphor-motions
since 1840, knowing that the explanation I then gave is the true
and <U+FB01>nal one.
    In 1844 I collected together and reprinted several of the papers
I had published during the preceding ten years in English and
American journals, those in the Philosophical Magazine among
the rest.
    Having been drawn into this camphor-controversy very need
lessly and very reluctantly, you, Gentlemen, will perhaps accord
me the privilege of the space of a few additional lines to ask the
attention of your readers to another topic.
    In the same Number of the Philosophical Magazine in which
Mr. Tomlinson’s original communication occurs, November 1862,
p. 407, there is a brief account of the recent discoveries of Dr. A.
 Weiss on the lines of the solar spectrum, to the effect. that he
 had observed in Greece, during the preceding year, the Frann
 hofer lines at sunrise and sunset, and had remarked their increase
 of number and their condensation. Dr. Weiss points out the
 advantages of the Ionian Islands for these observations, remark
 ing that the dense layers of vapour observed almost every day on
 the coasts of Africa and America, there scarcely disturb the
observer. He also refers to his previous publication on changes
 of the breadth of these lines at sunset, especially in the red and
yellow rays, and to the explanation he has given of their disloca
 tion by lateral absorption, Phil. Mag. July 1861, p. 80. With
 that explanation I am not at present interested.
    But I wish to relieve the atmosphere of America from the
reproach here unfairly put upon it, since it was in it, and by
 myself, that the fact in question was many years ago remarked.
 If your readers will turn to the Philosophical Magazine for May
 1843, p. 361, they will <U+FB01>nd the following paragraph, in con
nexion with the photographic depicting of Fraunhofer’s lines :—
    “Before proceeding to the description of the mode which is to
be followed, and of the characters of the lines themselves, I can
                                   2A2

844       Sir David Brewster on the Polarization of Light
not avoid calling attention to the remarkable circumstance which
has frequently presented itself to me, of a great change in the
relative visibility of Fraunhofer’s lines when seen at different
periods. There are times at which the strong lines seen in the
red ray are so feeble that the eye can barely catch them; and
then again they come out as dark as though marked in India
ink on the paper. During these changes the other lines may or
may not undergo corresponding variations. The same observa
tion equally applies to the blue and yellow rays. It has seemed
to me that the lines in the red are more visible as the sun ap
proaches the horizon, and those at the more refrangible end of
the spectrum are obvious in the middle of the day.”
    The appearance of the spectrum, as well as its chemical action,
varies with the hour of the day.      MM. Favre and Silbermann,
in their memoir “ On the Quantities of Heat disengaged in Che
mical and Molecular Actions,” published in the Annales de
 Chimie, 1853, vol. xxxvii. p. 500, have given a projection of three
 curves furnished by their own observations, and one derived from
 mine. From the discussion of these results they deduce that
 there is a connexion between the absorptive action of the atmo
 sphere, due to vapour contained in it in greater quantity in the
 afternoon, and the chemical power of the different spectrum-rays.
 They suggest that my experiments must have been made after
 midday, as was in fact the case.
    I intended to add some remarks respecting the so-called recent
 discovery of the variations of the spectrum and its lines when
 substances are burnt at different temperatures, but, fearing, that
 you will grow tired of these reclamations, will content myself with
 the hope that those of your readers who are occupying themselves
 with the spectroscope will not think their time wasted if they
 consult the pages of old Numbers of the Philosophical Magazine.
                                        Yours truly,

 XLVII. On the Polarization of Light by Rough and White Sur
   faces. By Sir DAVID Baawsrnn, K.H., D.C.L., F.R.S.*
      HE laws of the polarization of light when re<U+FB02>ected from
         the surfaces of solids and <U+FB02>uids, and when refracted and
 transmitted by translucent and transparent bodies, have been
 successfully investigated; but no experiments, I believe, have
 been made on the polarization of light by rough or unpolished
 surfaces, such as ground glass, painted surfaces, pounded glass,
   " From the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxiii.
 part 2.  Communicated by the Author.

                     by Rough and White Surfaces.                345
 snow, white powders, and solids and <U+FB02>uids re<U+FB02>ecting white light
 from their interior. When studying the polarization of the
 atmosphere, and anxious to discover the cause of its partial
 polarization, and of the three neutral points or spots in which
 there is no polarization, I investigated the action of rough sur
 faces upon light, under the conviction that the sky or atmo
 sphere was a rough surface like any aggregation of white or
 coloured particles. Had the atmosphere been specular, like
 water or any body with a polished surface, the image of the sun
 would have been seen in it by re<U+FB02>exion ; but being composed of
 aerial and aqueous molecules, it must re<U+FB02>ect the sun’s rays like
 pounded glass, or any white or coloured powders.
     The results of this inquiry, which I now submit to the Society,
 are such as I anticipated, and afford an explanation not only of
 the partial polarization produced by the atmosphere, but of each
 of the three neutral points, which, it will be shown, can be pro
 duced arti<U+FB01>cially by the combination of rays polarized by the
 re<U+FB02>exion and refraction of any rough or molecular surface.
     The experiments by which these results were obtained were
 made chie<U+FB02>y with rectangular plates of glass, 9 inches by 7, of
 various degrees of roughness, some with only one side, and
 others with both sides rough. These plates, some of which are
 now on the table, were made at the Smethwick Glass Works,
 near Birmingham, and were kindly presented to me by Messrs.
 Chance and Brothers, the proprietors of that great establishment.
    The angle of complete polarization for light re<U+FB02>ected from the
 polished surface of this glass is about 561,9, and the polarization
 is a maximum at this angle, diminishing on one side to 0° of
 incidence, and on the other to 90°. VVhen the light thus polar
 ized is examined by the band polariscope, the bands are nowhere
 interrupted, and therefore there can be no neutral point, the
polarization of the bands being everywhere positive or vertical.
    In order to observe the effect of a single rough surface, such
as that of glass ground with the <U+FB01>nest emery, I blackened with
 melted wax the polished surface of a plate which was ground
only on one side, in order to prevent the light scattered by the
 ground surface from being re<U+FB02>ected at the second surface. When
this single rough surface re<U+FB02>ected the light of a. gas-<U+FB02>ame, it
polarized it almost completely at nearly the polarizing angle of
56%° ; and there is no interruption or neutral point in the bands
of the polariscope. The rotation, therefore, or measure of polar
ization, is nearly 4-5°.
    If this single rough surface is placed at an open window when
the sun is not shining, and re<U+FB02>ects the light of the sky or clouds,
the light is only partially polarized, and the degree of polariza
tion R is only 19°. In the open air it is much less. Within

   346             Sir David Brewster on the Polarization of Light
   the room the polarization increases as the glass recedes from the
   window. In the open air it is a maximum when the plane of re
   <U+FB02>exion passes through the sun and the observer. The rotation is
   then 15°, and it diminishes with the distance of the plane of re
   <U+FB02>exion from the plane passing through the sun and the observer*.
       When the second or polished surface is not blackened, it re<U+FB02>ects
   the light scattered by the ground surface, and the maximum
   polarization of the rough surface is greatly diminished. The
   rotation is 16° with a gas-burner very near, and 20° when the
   <U+FB02>ame is still nearer. The polarization is diminished by holding
   a lighted candle on one side of the plane of re<U+FB02>exion.
       With a similar plate having a rougher surface, the degree of
   the polarization of the sun’s rays directly re<U+FB02>ected was 16§° close
   to a south window. Be-                                  Fig_ L
   fore noon the angle of
   maximum polarization                                       B
   was 44°, and at noon,
  with a brighter sun, it
  was 40°.
       When the whole light
  of the sky fell upon the
  rough surface M N, the                     D
. rotation was 21°. When                    1"                                         N
  A B was covered up, the
  rotation was diminished ; and when G D was covered up, the rota
  tion was increased.
       When_both the surfaces of the plate of glass are rough, the
  polarization is a maximum, at an angle greater than the normal
  polarizing angle, or 56§°, and the degree of polarization is
  about 20°.

       In all these experiments the partial polarization was positive
  or vertical from an incidence of 90° up to an incidence of 0°, as
  far as it could be.observed owing to the impossibility of examin
  ing the bands where they were re<U+FB02>ected at or near a perpen
  dicular incidence. In order to meet this dii<U+FB01>culty I adopted

was illuminated with the <U+FB02>ame                                   E
of a gas-burner, or a moderator                                 "
lamp, placed at F. The ob
server at E, or in any direction
between F and N, observes the
condition of the bands of the
polariscopewhentheyareplaced
parallel to M N.
  If we now take a single rough
surface of plate-glass blackened      -.--_......___..
on its polished side and place                   3     G   A 8'
it at M N, we shall observe a
neutral point about H, the polariscope-bands being negative or
horizontal with a white centre on the M side of H, and positive
or vertical with a black centre on the N side of H. This neu
tral point is obviously produced by the equal and opposite action
of light polarized by re<U+FB01>exion and refraction. As these two
lights, proceeding from the light incident at H, proceed from F,
they cannot reach the eye at E by the ordinary law of re<U+FB01>exion.
They are portions, therefore, of oppositely polarized rays scat
tered in every direction by the rough surface of the glass.
    If we take the same plate of glass with its surface not black
ened and place it at M N, we shall <U+FB01>nd the neutral point at G.
    If we invert this plate, so that its polished side is uppermost,
the neutral point is advanced to A, all the bands on the M side
of A being, as before, negative, and those on the N side of A
positive—a result proving that the intensity of the negative
 bands had been increased, and the positive ones diminished.
    Conceiving that this effect was produced by the light scattered
by the rough surface being polarized negatively by the refraction
of the polished surface, I took the plate with the blackened side
and laid upon its surface a plate of transparent glass, in order
to imitate the action of the unpolished surface in the preceding
experiment. The neutral point which, by the action of the
 single rough surface, was at H, was now advanced to A by the
 refractive polarization of the two surfaces of the transparent plate.
 When this plate was placed at mn parallel to MN, the very
 same effect was produced. By inclining mn, the neutral point
 was advanced from A to a, still further by increasing the incli
 nation, and still further by using several plates, the plane of
 ?fraction or incidence being parallel to a plane passing through
   G A.
    If we turn the plate or plates at m n round 90°, keeping the
 same inclination to the incident rays from MN, the neutral

348         Sir David Brewster on the Polarization of Light
points will return to their respective places a, A, G, H, the
refractive polarization of the plate or plates reducing the nega
tive bands between M and the neutral points, and increasing
the positive bands between the neutral points and N.
    Hence we have a method of determining whether the polari
zation of the bands is positive or negative, when they are so
faint or indistinct that we cannot see whether the central band
 is black or white. When they become less intense, or perhaps
 disappear, by viewing them through one or more plates of glass
 at m n, having their planes of re<U+FB02>exion parallel to the plane pass
 ing through FA, they are positive. When they become more
intense they are negative.
     The place of any neutral point may be advanced from H to G,
 or from G to A and a, by placing a sheet of white paper behind
 the rough-urfaced plate M N, or by one or more plates of glass
 with rough-surfaces, each plate advancing it further. A sheet
 of paper advances it further than four surfaces of ground glass.
 The rays scattered by the paper are negatively polarized by
 refraction at their emergence from the plate M N ; and the in
 creased intensity of the negative bands shifts the neutral point
 towards N.
     We have already seen that a single rough surface of glass
 blackened behind has its neutral point about H, and when not
 blackened, about G. A plate with both sides rough carries the
 neutral point towards A, and two or more such plates still
 further. The smoothest ground plates carry the neutral point
 further than the roughest towards M.
     In the prosecution of this subject I submitted to examination
 the following substances :—
    Calcareousspar, ground.  Linen cloth, white.   Swan’s down.
    Marble, white.           Cotton cloth, white.  Snow.
    Painted board.           Cashmere, white.      Pearl-oyster shell.
    Ivory.                   Paper of all colours. Pounded sugar.
    Ivory, arti<U+FB01>cial.        Parchment.            Pounded glass.
    Bone.                    White kid leather.    Rochelle salts.
    Porcelain.               Pith of the sola.     Soda.
    White <U+FB01>r wood, planed.   Rice paper.           Magnesia.
    Yellow <U+FB01>r wood, planed.  Cotton wool.          Milk.
     Silk, white.            Ermine.               White shell.
     Satin, white.
      In all these substances I found a neutral point in the mixture
  of the positively and negatively polarized rays which they re<U+FB02>ect.
  In many of them the neutral point was on the A side of G, or
  when the angle of incidence was less than 90°; while in others
  it was on the H. side, or when the angle of incidence was nega
  tive and greater than 0°, but on the other side of the perpendi
  cular F G.

                   by Rough and I/Vhite Surfaces.              349
   As in ground glass, one or more plates of glass inclined to
the re<U+FB02>ected ray, as previously described, brought the neutral
point in almost all these substances to the A or N side of G.
    When the substance was more or less glazed, the neutral
point was on the A side of G, the glazed surface acting exactly
like the polished surface of a plate of ground-glass when placed
next the light. This effect is <U+FB01>nely seen in milk, where the
<U+FB02>uid surface increases the negative or refracted light as in the
glass plate.
   I attempted to determine for several of these substances the
angle of maximum polarization, the intensity of the partial polari
zation, and the place of the neutral point; but I found it very
di<U+FB01>icult, owing to the magnitude of the <U+FB02>ame which was neces
sary to show the bands when very faint, and to its proximity to
the re<U+FB02>ecting surface, which was necessary for the same purpose.
   In white unglazed paper, for example, in the sun’s light on
the 1st of February 1841, at 111‘ A.M., the polarizing angle was
about 71°, and the degree of polarization, or R=1S;}°. On the
2nd of February the polarizing angle was 69?’, and B.=l8i-°
at 1011 40"“ A.M.
    In almost all the substances which I have examined, I have
observed a neutral point only at angles of incidence below the
maximum polarizing angle, and beyond G, <U+FB01>g. 2; but it is ob
vious that there must be another at some angle above the maxi
mum polarizing angle, excepting in substances where the light
polarized by refraction is too feeble to neutralize the light po
larized by re<U+FB02>exion. I have observed this second neutral point
only in one case ; but with a su<U+FB01>iciently strong light it will
 doubtless be seen in many substances.
    In all the preceding experiments, the substances employed
have been opake, or with such rough surfaces that objects
 cannot be seen through them. I was therefore desirous of
ascertaining if neutral points were produced when the surfaces
which polarize the light were perfectly transparent, having some
analogy with the strata of the atmosphere of different densities.
With this view I used a pile of transparent plates with twenty
surfaces, and I found a neutral point distinctly visible, both
above and below the angle of complete-polarization. I obtained
the same result at an angle less than that of complete polariza
 tion, with a large plate of mica split by an intense heat into so
 many <U+FB01>lms that it had the metallic lustre of silver.
    The results now submitted to the Society could hardly have
been anticipated from theoretical considerations. The laws of
polarization for light normally re<U+FB02>ected and refracted by po
lished surfaces, are not applicable to those which are rough, or

350        Mr. A. Cayley on the Stereoyraphic Projection
to bodies which re<U+FB02>ect light from their interior ; and in the case
of piles of polished glass plates, the most distinguished philo
sophers, Arago, Young, and Sir John Herschel, would have
considered the light which the plates re<U+FB02>ected, as they did that
which they transmitted, as consisting of polarized light, accom
panied with a portion of common light, a combination incapable
of producing neutral points.
   The most important application of the preceding experiments
is to the polarization of the atmosphere. Arago, Babinet, and
others, in their theory of the neutral points, and of the partial
polarization of the atmosphere, took no account of the rays which
are polarized by refraction whenever light is polarized by re
<U+FB02>exion, and they referred these abnormal phenomena to a hori
zontal secondary re<U+FB02>exion from the atmosphere itself, modifying,
and, in three neutral points, extinguishing the light polarized
by re<U+FB02>exion. Whether or not such a secondary re<U+FB02>exion exists,
or is adequate, if it does, to account for these phenomena, are
questions which will be considered in another paper on the
polarization of the atmosphere. But however ingenious may be
the hypothesis, it has no support either from experiment or
observation. The reduction of complete to partial polarization,
by the opposite action of light polarized by re<U+FB02>exion and light
polarized by refraction, and the production of neutral points
where these two lights are equal, whenever light is incident on
surfaces which, like the atmosphere, disperse and polarize it,
is next to an ocular proof of the true laws of atmospherical
polarization.
   It is not one of the least wonders of terrestrial physics, that
the blue atmosphere which overhangs us exhibits, in the light
which it polarizes, phenomena somewhat analogous to those of
crystals with two axes of double refraction.
XLVIII. On the Stereograpkic Projection of the Spherical Conic.
                     By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
IN order to the tolerable delineation of some <U+FB01>gures relating
     to spherical geometry, l had occasion to consider the stereo
graphic projection of the spherical conic. To <U+FB01>x the ideas,
imagine a sphere having its centre in the plane of the paper,
and through the centre three rectangular axes, that of .z' hori
zontal and that of 3/ vertical, in the plane of the paper, and
the axis of 2 perpendicular to and in front of the plane of the
paper. The radius of the sphere is taken equal to unity (so that
its intersection by the plane of the paper is the circle radius
unity), and the points X, Y, and Z are taken to denote the
                    * Communicated by the Author.

                        of the Spherical Conic.                   351
points where the axes, drawn in the positive direction, meet the
surface of the sphere ; and the opposite points are called X’, Y’,
and Z’. The eye is supposed to be at Z, and the projection to
be made on the plane of the paper. This being so, and sup
posing that the axes of coordinates are the principal axes of the
spherical conic, the axis of .z- being the interior axis, and taking
E, 17, Q’ as the coordinates of a point on the spherical conic, its
equations are
                          E? + "Q + be        = 1:

plane conic which is the gnomonic projection            e. the projec
tion by lines through the centre of the sphere) of the spherical
conic on the tangent plane at X or X’.
    Taking, for a moment, .z', y, 2 as the coordinates of a point
on the projecting line (that is, the line through the eye to a
point (E, n, Q’) on the spherical conic), the equation of this line is
                           ~£_z_z—1.

    It is now very easy to trace the curve. We see <U+FB01>rst that the
curve is symmetrical with respect to the axes, and that it meets
the axis of y in four imaginary points, but the axis of .22 in four
 real points, the coordinates whereof are
                         .z'=i( 4/1+c9ic),
so that the two points on the same side of the centre are the
images one of the other in regard to the circle radius unity.
Moreover the curve touches the lines
                              y= i.z'tan,8
at their intersections with the circle. By developing in regard
to y, the equation becomes

and putting

the last term vanishes, and the equation gives y’: 0, or

In the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>gure /3 is less, in the second <U+FB01>gure greater than this

rison of the two <U+FB01>gures.
   I take the opportunity to mention the following theorem,
which is perhaps known, but I have not met with it anywhere;
viz. any three circles, each two of which meet, may be considered
as the stereographic projections of three great circles of the
sphere. In fact suppose, as above, that the projection is made
on the plane of a great circle, and calling this the principal circle,
the projection of any other great circle meets the principal circle
at the extremities of a diameter of the principal circle. It fol
lows that the theorem will be true, if, given any three circles each
two of which meet, a circle can be drawn meeting the given
circles, each of them at the extremities of a diameter of the circle
so to be drawn. It is easy to see that the required circle has
for its centre the radical centre (point of intersection of the
radical axes) of the given circles, and that the radius is the
‘ Inner Potency ’ of the point in question in regard to each of the
three given circles. In particular the three circles having for
centres the vertices of an equilateral triangle, and the side for
radius, may be considered as the stereographic projections of
three great circles of a sphere. This is a very ready mode of
delineation of a spherical <U+FB01>gure depending on three great circles
of the sphere.

  XLIX. Reply to some remarks by G. Kirchhoff in his Paper “On
     the History of Spectrum Analysis.” By BALFOUR STEWART,
     M./1., F.R.S.
        MY DEAR Sm DAVID BREWSTER,
     N the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine I have
       perused an article by Professor Kirchhoff, of Heidelberg, “On
  the History of Spectrum Analysis and of the Analysis of the
  Solar Atmosphere.” In the course of his remarks the learned
  author has reviewed in a somewhat disparaging manner some
  researches of mine on radiant heat, in consequence of which I
  am forced to reply, although very unwillingly, and desiring
  much to avoid a scienti<U+FB01>c controversy, especially with Professor
   Kirchhoff as an opponent.
     The experiments in con<U+FB01>rmation of my views were made in
  the physical laboratory of the University of Edinburgh in the
  beginning of the year 1858, and my account of them was, in
  March of the same year, communicated to the Royal Society of
  Edinburgh by Principal Forbes, whose name is well known in
  connexion with radiant heat, and who gave me much valuable
  assistance and advice during the progress of these experiments.
     I entertain a hope that you, as a distinguished office-bearer
  in both of these scienti<U+FB01>c bodies, will afford me the opportu
  nity of brie<U+FB02>y vindicating in your Journal the claims of these
  researches to a greater measure of completeness than the learned
  Heidelberg Professor seems disposed to allow.
     It was the theoretical extension of Prevost’s law of exchanges
  which <U+FB01>rst presented itself to my mind ; nor did I omit to obtain
  the best possible experimental veri<U+FB01>cation of my views, or to
  present this to men of science as the chief feature, grounding
  the theory upon the experiments, rather than deducing the ex
  periments from the theory.
     It was thus that dark heat came to form the subject of these
  investigations; for as the point to be proved was an extension of
  Prevost’s theory, it was necessary to deal with rays which were
  universally acknowledged to produce heat by their absorption;
  and hence luminous rays were excluded, since it was still an open
  question whether these were in all cases capable of producing
  heat. I shall only add that it was attempted, as far as possible,
  to disengage the proof, theoretical and experimental, from the
  embarrassment of considering surface re<U+FB01>exion.
     I <U+FB01>rst endeavoured to show, not only as a simple deduction
  from the theory of exchanges, but also as the result of experi
  ment, that in a <U+FB01>eld of uniform temperature the absorption of a
  plate or particle is equal to its radiation. Now, since a thick
' plate absorbs more heat than a thin one, it will also radiate more,

       Mr. B. Stewart on the History of Spectrum Analysis.         355
  so that here we are at once led to acknowledge a radiation pro
  ceeding from the interior of bodies as well as one from their
  surfaces.                              _
     Having thus shown that the equilibrium demanded by Pre
  vost’s theory extends into the substance of bodies, experiments
  were next made on rock-salt, mica, and glass, which resulted in
  proving “that every body which sifts heat in its passage through
  its substance is more opake with regard to heat radiated by a
  thin slice of its own substance, than it is with regard to ordinary
  heat.” This experimental result was conceived to involve the fol
  lowing extension of the law of equilibrium : “ The absorption of
  a plate or particle equals its radiation, and that for every descrip
  tion of heat."
     On this proof from experiment Kirchhoff remarks as follows:
  “The proof cannot be a strict one, because experiments which
  have only taught us concerning more and less, cannot strictly
  teach us concerning equality.”
      I presume this means that since one cannot experimentally
  insulate a ray of heat of a de<U+FB01>nite refrangibility, a strict proof
  cannot in this way be obtained. I shall only remark that the
  same objection holds with regard to many of our most valuable
  experiments on dark heat.        I cannot, however, admit that the
  dif<U+FB01>culty of this experimental veri<U+FB01>cation is surmounted or even
  lessened by employing a high temperature and selecting a de<U+FB01>
  nite ray of light. For in this case it is necessary to compare
  together at the same temperature a body such as a <U+FB02>ame, and a
  black body such as carbon; and here while an equality of radia
  tion and absorption may be easily procured, it will be very diffi
  cult, if not impossible, to prove the necessary equality of tempera
  ture between the two bodies. I shall afterwards show that the
I best experimental proof of this law is given by the fact that
L coloured glasses lose their colour in the <U+FB01>re.
5    To return to the proof from dark heat. This is followed by a
  theoretical demonstration that the law thus rendered experiment
  ally probable is also necessarily true. Kirchhoff remarks regard
  ing this :—“ And then he (Stewart) proceeds to more abstruse
  considerations which are intended to give such a rigid demon
  stration, and in which the meaning he attaches to the expressions
  absorption and radiation are more nearly de<U+FB01>ned. These consi
  derations, however, are not su<U+FB02>iciently general or su<U+FB01>iciently
  precise to attain the required end; so that, after all, Stewart’s
  proposition remains an hypothesis to which some probability is
  attached.”
      Now this proof is so far from being abstruse, that, with your
  permission, I shall state it simply in a few words, leaving men
  of science to judge for themselves of its completeness. Having

356    Mr. B. Stewart’s Reply to some remarks by M. Kirchhoff
proved (with perfect right, as Kirchhoff himself allows) that
radiation proceeds from the interior of bodies as well as from
their surface, the question then occurs, “Are we to suppose each
particle of each substance to have at a given temperature an in
dependent radiation of its own, equal, of course, in all direc
tions ?” It might have been answered to this, that radiation is
a property of the particles of a body which we cannot well con
ceive of as being in<U+FB02>uenced by the position of those particles in
the substance of the body; so that perhaps it was hardly neces
sary to prove that the radiation of a particle or plate is indepen
dent of its distance from the surface. Nevertheless I have shown
experimentally that the heat from two plates of rock-salt placed
the one behind the other is the same as that from a single plate
equal in thickness to the two.
   Assuming it therefore as proved that the radiation of a par
ticle or plate is independent of its distance from the surface, the
proof of the law which asserts “ that absorption is equal to radia
tion, and that for every description of heat,” may for convenience’
sake be carried into the interior of the body, by which means we
are able to rid ourselves of surface re<U+FB02>exion. Let us therefore
suppose that in the interior a stream of radiant heat is constantly
<U+FB02>owing past a particle A in the direction of the next particle B.
Now, since radiation is independent of distance from the surface,
the radiation of A is equal to that of B ; and since absorption is
equal to radiation, the absorption of A is therefore equal to that
of B. Again, as the stream of radiant heat passes A, part of it
will be absorbed by A ; but since the radiation of A is equal to
its absorption, this stream will be as much recruited by the one
as it is diminished by the other, so that when it has passed A it
will be found unaltered by its passage with regard to quantity.
   Of this heat it has already been shown that B absorbs as much
as A ; and in order that this may be the case, the quality as well
as the quantity of the heat which impinges upon B mut be the
same as those of the heat which impinged upon A. For, suppose
that the heat, by passing A, had changed its quality though
not its quantity, and that it had been transformed intoa descrip
tion of heat scarcely absorbed at all by the substance in question ;
then the absorption of B would manifestly be less than that of
A, and this we have already shown cannot be the case. We
conclude therefore that the stream of heat, in passing A, has
neither altered its quantity nor its quality, and hence we argue
that radiation is equal to absorption, and that for every descrip
tion of heat.
   This is the whole proof; and I am quite at a loss to know
in what respect it is de<U+FB01>cient, especially since Kirchhoff has
not de<U+FB01>nitely stated his objections. Having gone so far, we

         in his Paper “ On the History of Spectrum Analysis.” 7 357
  are now enabled to obtain a clear conception of internal radia
  tion. For since the stream of heat, as it proceeds, is just as
  much recruited as it is absorbed, we may to all intents regard
  this as if it were proceedingin a diathermanous medium without
  being absorbed at all, the absorption being virtually cancelled by
  the equal radiation.
      I next endeavour to answer the following question : “Is the
  law of an equal and independent radiation of each particle of a
  body theoretically consistent with equilibrium of temperature?
  That is, suppose we have any irregularly-shaped enclosure walled
  round with a variety of substances, and each particle of each
  substance radiating into the enclosure,—from the sides of which
  it is re<U+FB02>ected many times backwards and forwards before it is
  <U+FB01>nally absorbed,—this being the case, will the law of equal and
  independent radiation, and those of re<U+FB02>exion and refraction so
  <U+FB01>t with one another, that every particle of the walls of the enclo
  sure shall absorb precisely as much heat as it radiates?”
     This question is answered in the affirmative; but Kirchhoff
  makes the following remarks on the proof :—-“ By employing
  the law ‘ of equal and independent radiation’ and the laws of
  re<U+FB02>exion and refraction, Stewart forms the equation expressing
  the proposition which has to be proved concerning the equality
  of absorption and radiation for heat of every kind. It appears
  that this equation contains no contradiction, but expresses a pos
  sible property of the internal radiation in a body. He argues
  from this that the proposition concerning the equality of absorp
 tion and radiation for every kind of ray must hold good. This
 is evidently a false conclusion. The above consideration proves
 that the proposition is possibly, but not that it is necessarily true.”
     I am quite unable to comprehend the meaning of these
 remarks. As far as I understand myself, I have already proved
 the proposition concerning the equality of absorption and radia
 tion for heat of every kind. The object now is in some respects
a super<U+FB02>uous work, this being to show that the law already proved
<U+FB01>ts in with the laws of refraction and re<U+FB02>exion. In order to
accomplish this, I conceive two inde<U+FB01>nitely extended parallel
plane surfaces to be separated from one another by a small
interval, one of these being a perfectly black surface, and the
other the polished surface of a diathermanous uncrystallized
body inde<U+FB01>nitely extended downwards. An equation is soon
obtained, one member of which expresses the amount of heat of
a particular wave-length which leaves the diathermanous body
in a given direction, and the other the amount of heat of the
same description which enters the body in this direction.
~    Now the one member of this equation must necessarily be equal
to the other. For it has been already proved that the radiation
     Phil. May. S, 4. Vol. 25. No. 169. Jilay 1863.            2B

3581 Mr.‘ B. Stewart’s Reply to some remarks by M. Kirchhoff
of an interior particle is equal in all directions; and it follows
that the <U+FB02>ow of heat radiating inwards in a given direction must
necessarily be equal in quality as well as in quantity to that
which radiates outwards in the same direction. As might be
expected, the equation implies no contradiction, but repays our
trouble with additional information regarding the <U+FB02>ow of internal
radiant heat.     '                                           '
   It -is an immediate corollary from this proof, that the polished
surface under consideration, if we add together radiation and
re<U+FB02>exion, behaves precisely like a surface of lampblack ; and it
also easily follows that, instead of the plane black surface, we
may substitute an enclosure of any substance or form. For since
the heat which leaves the transparent surface is unaffected by
this substitution, it is evident, from the law of equality which
we have been considering, that the heat which enters this sur
face must be in like manner unaffected by the same substitution.
   It thus appears that the equilibrium of temperature for the
transparent body demands that the surrounding enclosure shall
act like a surface of lampblack, and that, while this is demanded
on the part of the other bodies, the transparent substance offers
in itself no exception to the law.
   One word with regard to the assertion that the <U+FB02>ow of internal
radiant heat is proportional to the index of refraction. It will
be seen that in my <U+FB01>rst researches, when de<U+FB01>ning internal radia
tion, I con<U+FB01>ned myself to two dimensions of space, and arrived
at a result which was quite true for this de<U+FB01>nition. I afterwards
conceived that it would be a more complete view to regard the
subject in three dimensions, and in my future papers I made the
necessary alteration. The change from it to pi‘ does not there
fore imply a change from error to truth, but only one from a
less perfect to a more perfect way of viewing the subject. While
in one plane the bundle of rays opens out in the proportion of 1
to fl, it also opens out similarly in aplane perpendicular to the
former; so that multiplying the one ratio by the other, and
viewing the solid angle, these rays will open out in the ratio of
1 to pg.
   I think it will be seen from these remarks that, in order to
obtain a complete solution of this problem, we must consider
internal radiation, and that, as far as regards uncrystallized
bodies, this solution has been already obtai!1ell- But for cry
stallized bodies I do not hesitate to say that the problem is still
unsolved; nor is any one better able than yourself to appre
ciate the di<U+FB01>iculties which attend investigations in this quarter.
   I shall now brie<U+FB02>y allude to the subject of light, to which my.
attention was next directed. Here I obtained experimental
results precisely analogous to those which had been <U+FB02>vund. ‘ts

       in his Paper “On the History of Spectrum Analysis.”      359
hold for dark heat. An explanation of these results requires us
to admit that luminous rays shall in all cases produce heat by
their absorption, and Iihave been informed by an eminent phy
sicist of this country that he considers this to be one of the
best proofs yet given of the identity between light and heat.
Now, if we assume this identity as proved, the fact that heated
coloured glasses invariably lose their colour in the <U+FB01>re, seems to
afford a perfect experimental proof of the equality between
absorption and radiation for every description of heat; for the
conditions of the experiment evidently secure an equality of
temperature between the dark body and the transparent one,
while the eye becomes the best possible judge of the equality
between radiation and absorption for every individual ray. I
shall not here enter upon the question to what extent Kirchhoff
in his demonstration had previously been forestalled by Provos
taye ; I may remark, however, that the proof of the Heidelberg
 Professor is so very elaborate that I fear it has found few readers
either in his own country or in this. I conceive, besides, that
 it is an objection to the completeness of this proof that the sub
ject of internal radiation is not investigated; and Ithink, more
 over, that the experimental support which is here derived from
 light is not so unobjectionable as that afforded by those rays
 which are universally acknowledged to produce heat by their
 absorption.
     I confess, however, that in new problems I do not attach the
  same extreme importance as the Heidelberg Professor to logical
  completeness of demonstration; for if the object of the investi
  gator be to hasten on the progress of human knowledge, when
  such a one has matured a su<U+FB02>iciently good demonstration which
  he has well supported by experiments, it is surely neither advi
  sable no'r is it right that he should any longer defer, to publish
  the results which he has obtained.                                 _'
      Although I preceded Kirchhoff nearly two years in my demon
  stration, I did not hesitate to acknowledge that his solution
  had been independently obtained ; but, as a general principle, I
  cannot consent to admit that when a man of science has proved
  a new law and is followed by another who from the same, pre
  mises deduces the same conclusion, the latter is justified in de
  preciating the labours of the former because he conceives that
  his own solution is more complete.
      Will Kirchhoff himself willingly forego his own claims in
   favour of any one who.shall in future ages devise (if this be
   possible) a simpler and more convincing demonstration than
   that which has been given us by the Heidelberg Professor? I
   feel, Sir, that, as an historian of science, you will acknowledge
   the justice of these remark, and join with me in regretting that

   L. On the Motion of Vapours toward the Cold. By CHARLES
      ToM1.1NsoN, Lecturer onPh_1/sical Science, Kin_q’s College School,
      London.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         GENTLEMEN,
        HAVE just been arranging for repetition Dr. Woods’s in
         genious and beautiful experiment on the motion of vapours
   toward the cold, as described by him in the current Number of
   your Magazine.
      While engaged last summer in investigating the law of the
  motions of camphor, &c. toward the light, I performed a number
  of experiments in the same direction as that by Dr. Woods.
  They were not described in my paper inserted in your Magazine
 for November last, because in it, as at the British Association
 Meeting in October, I wished to be as concise as possible; but
 you will remember that in my published paper I state (p. 361)
 that “ I omit many subsidiary facts observed during the inquiry.”
 The following are a few of them.
  - On the 21st of May, 1862, a solution of iodine in bisulphide
of carbon was put into a stoppled eight-ounce phial in quantity
su<U+FB02>icient to form a ring at the bottom and to surround a central
convex island. The bottle was placed in a west window. The
day was cloudy and wet. In the course of an hour a violet dew
was formed a little above the olution. In another half hour
 (i. e. at noon) the dew became more copious, and extended over
nearly the whole surface of the bottle, but was densest on the
side nearest the light. In another half hour (12.30 P.M.) the
beads of dew were maller and paler. At 1 P.M. they had
become almost colourless, and solid iodine had condensed on the
convex island at the bottom of the phial. At 3 and also at
4 P.M. there was a gleam of sunshine, when the bottle became
<U+FB01>lled with a yellowish vapour and the dew again became coloured,

                            toward the Cold.                      36],
   though faintly. At 7 P.M. the dew formed a violet are on the
  side nearest the window.
  , On the morning of the 22nd the are was pale, and there was
   a dense deposit of thick purple matter on the furthest side just
   above the liquid ring. At 5 P.M., the sun being on the window,
   the dark-coloured deposit was on the nearest side, but equally
  low down. These are e<U+FB01>'ects of capillarity evidently similar to
 those so well described by Dr. VVoods ; but I paid no particular
 attention to them at the time, as my mind was occupied with
 other phenomena.
     As the season advanced and became more settled, the pheno
 mena varied. A. portion of the bisulphide was decomposed, and
  another portion forced its way out of the bottle. During these
 events the motions of the vapour went on with the regularity of
  a clock. When the sun was on the window, a current apparently
 rose on the nearest side and descended on the furthest, where the
  deposit was made. When the sun was off the window, the cur
 rent set in in the opposite direction ; and the nearest side being
 the colder, the deposit was transferred to it. These motions
 were marked in an interesting manner at the sides of the bottle;
 at <U+FB01>rst by well-shaped parabolic spaces, marking the temperate
 regions between the hot and the cold ones; afterwards by lines
 as straight as if ruled, diverging above and below from a centre
 placed a little above the liquid.   The lines above this centre were
 several inches in length ,- those below it about a third of an inch.
 These lines, lastly, changed into a minute sea-weed pattern which
 remained <U+FB01>xed for some weeks ; but I <U+FB01>nd by my note-book that
 the bottle had become dry early in June.
     A similar experiment was also tried with phosphorus in bisul
 phide of carbon, Ste.
     I also performed a number of experiments on the motion of
the vapour of water towards the light. During many years I
 had often noticed, when preparing gases for the purpose of a
 lecture, that the moisture condensed on the sides of the gas-jars
 and bottles was of a different pattern with different gases. I spe
culated a good deal as to why this should be so, but now deter
mined to bring the fact under the ordeal of exact experiment.
Accordingly in May last I <U+FB01>lled six quart stoppled bottles, No. 1
with oxygen, No. 2 with nitrogen, No. 3 with hydrogen, No. 4
with nitric oxide, No. 5 with carbonic oxide, and No. 6 with
carbonic acid. The gases were collected over water at the
pneumatic trough, and about half an ounce of water was left
in each bottle, which was tied over with soft leather wetted
in a solution of gum, which was also run round the stopple.
The bottles were placed on a table near a west window, and a
journal was kept of their proceedings, which were recorded twice‘

362         Mr. C. Tomlinson on the Motion of Vapours
 a day, together with the temperature and the state of the weather.
 The dew was of the most varied character in the different bottles :
 in some it was <U+FB01>ne, in others coarse ; and the deposit was also fre
  uently ploughed into furrows by the weeping tears which trickled
' own as the moisture on the inner side of the shoulder of the
bottle became overcharged. It was beautiful to see the almost
clocklike regularity with which the deposits oscillated between
 the front and back of the bottles.       At 9 A.M., when the <U+FB01>rst
 observation was generally made, the deposits were on the side
 nearest the window, often occupying exactly one-half of the
bottle; at 3, 4, or 5 P.M., when the second observation was
 taken and the bottles had been exposed to the sun some time,
 the deposit was on the furthest side. When the afternoon was
 cloudless, the bottles were <U+FB01>lled with vapour; but as the evening
 advanced, the deposits were made on the furthest side, again to
 pass over to the nearest side as the cold of night was felt.
    With respect, however, to the texture of the dew, the results
 were anomalous. After several weeks’ observation I was not in
 a condition to place my <U+FB01>nger on any one bottle and name its
 contents from the character of the aqueous deposit-—except per
 haps in the case of carbonic acid, which declared itself by its
 superior solubility. 'Suspecting that the bottles, although new
 from the glass-warehouse, were not clean, I washed out other
 similar bottles with strong sulphuric acid, rinsed them with clean
 water, and <U+FB01>lled No. I. with air, No. II. with hydrogen, and
 No. III. with carbonic acid. On placing these near the window,
 the results were certainly such as to justify the conclusion that
 the deposits of moisture are similar in various gases if the re
 ceiving surface be chemically clean. In such case, however, we
 get, not dew, but a sheet of Water marked by weeping tears, but
 without furrows ; and it is oftendi<U+FB02>icult to distinguish on which
 side the deposit is made, so regular is the watery <U+FB01>lm. There
 can be no doubt, however, as to its being deposited on the
 colder side.
    But if vapour of water in different media presents similar
 phenomena, different vapours in the same medium give varied
 phenomena. I have arranged in the window, as nearly as pos
 sible under similar circumstances, clean 8-ounce phials contain
 ing small quantities of alcohol, ether, benzole, belmontine, bisul
 phide of carbon, &c. The deposits varied in texture according
 to some law depending partly on the varying cohesive force of
 the liquids in question, by which they form drops of different
 sizes from the same aperture, and ascend to different heights in
 capillary tubes of the same bore.
    I ma here be allowed to refer to one of Dr. Draper’s experi
ments, in which the inside of a glass bottle being marked with a

blunt point, such as that of a glass rod, the camphor vapour is
afterwards deposited along the marks. A fact of this kind was
pointed out more than a century ago by De Mairan *, who noticed
that the hoar-frost was deposited on his window-panes in spiral
lines, produced, as he supposed, by the <U+FB01>ne sand or ashes used
in cleaning the windows; and although these lines were not
visible to the eye, they nevertheless formed ridges sufficiently
prominent to catch the condensing vapour. To test this idea,
Carena1', in the severe winter of 1814, cleaned four panes of his
window with <U+FB01>ne sand, rubbing two of them with a circular
movement, a third in straight lines from top to bottom, and a
fourth in diagonal lines. On the next day and on several suc-
 ceeding days the hoar-frost was deposited more or less on the
 lines or furrows produced by the friction.
     In the older memoirs and treatises on dew, the writers are very
fond of ornamenting their work with pleasing <U+FB01>gures of dew and
hoar-frost as it appears on various objects ; and they attribute the
 differences in the patterns of the watery particles to differences in
the radiating powers of the objects in question. It does not seem
to have been suspected that the varied patterns also depend on the
 want of adhesion to the surface. When this is chemically clean we
 get, not dew, but a sheet of water. All objects exposed to the
 air contract an organic <U+FB01>lm; and when the inner surface of a
 bottle, for example, as in Dr. Draper’s experiment, is rubbed
with a blunt point, the <U+FB01>lm is raised into ridges which catch the
 camphor vapour more readily than the other parts of the sur
 facejlj. Indeed so sensitive is this vapour in detecting promi
 nences, that it will attach itself to, and render visible minute
 objects on the inner surface of the bottle which before were
 quite invisible. For example, I have many times washed out a
 bottle and wiped it dry with a clean cloth.       The bottle appeared
 to be perfectly clean to the eye; et after a few minutes’ expo
 sure to the sun, with its charge ofycrude camphor, innumerable
<U+FB01>laments, evidently derived from the duster, would start into
view from being coated with a very thin layer of camphor.
     In a small volume recently published, entitled “ Experimental
 Essays,” I give some specimens of camphor-<U+FB01>gures modi<U+FB01>ed by
 the presence of vapour of benzole, wood-spirit, naphtha, chloro
 form, nitric acid, &c.        One of the actions of these liquids is
 apparently to modify the rate of evaporation of the camphor.

 Equal quantities of camphor were placed in glass capsules before
 a window, and were wetted with the same number of drops
 from the end of a glass rod. The liquids were water, benzolc,
 ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon, and alcohol.    A similar
 weight of camphor was left untouched for comparison. The cam
 phor disappeared by evaporation at very different rates; but the
 experiment requires to be repeated with more care before nume
 rical results can be given. It illustrates probably only a case of
 adhesion. The liquids partly dissolve, spread out the camphor, and
 attach it with more or less force to the capsules. I have also
 observed that where camphor has been touched with bisulphide
of carbon, &c. and then exposed to the light in stoppled bottles,
 a creeping kind of vegetation is formed; and unless the tem
perature be higher than that of the air in the shade, the deposits
are very different from those obtained from camphor not embar
rassed by the presence of another vapour.

curious one and might repay further inquiry; but as far as my

multiply facts without leading to any useful principle. I fear

            LI. On the Absorption of Gases by Charcoal.
      By JOHN HUNTER, Scholar, Queen’s College, Belfast*.
I AM induced to publish rather sooner than I intended the
       following preliminary results ‘of a series of experiments
with which I have been engaged for some time on the absorp
tion of gases by charcoal, in consequence of observing that a
paper on the same subject has lately been read before the Royal
Society.
   In this inquiry I have followed nearly the same method which
was employed by Th. de Saussure in his well-known memoirs on
the absorption of gases by charcoal and other bodies. The gases,
carefully dried, were collected over mercury, and after their
volume had been observed the charcoal was introduced. It was
heated to redness before each experiment, and while in a state of
incandescence immersed under mercury. My <U+FB01>rst objectwas to
ascertain the absorbing power of different kinds of charcoal; and
                     "‘ Communicated by the Author.

     ,'Mr. J. Hunter on the Absoiption of Gases by Charcoal. ‘365
  to this part of the inquiry the present short paper is devoted.
  It will be observed that while the numbers indicating the absorp
  tions agree remarkably well in many experiments, in others they
  differ considerably. When the gas is largely absorbed, as in the
  case of ammonia, by logwood charcoal, the absorption is extremely
  rapid, and terminates in a much shorter time than when the entire
  absorption is less. The variations in the amount of absorption
  are probably due in part to the slight diiferences which must
  exist in the pores of different pieces of the same charcoal, and
  also to unavoidable di<U+FB02>erences in the heating of the charcoals in
  each experiment. In order to determine the effect of long-con
  tinued heat on the absorbing power of the charcoal, I kept a
  piece of boxwood charcoal at a strong red heat for upwards of an
  hour, after which its absorption for ammonia was found to be 79,
  while when heated in the ordinary way it was 85. In all these
  experiments the charcoal was heated as nearly as possible to the
  same temperature and for the same length of time. The ab
  sorption generally terminated at the end of about twenty-four
  hours, so that it was not increased by allowing the charcoal to
  remain longer in contact with the gas. Charcoals do not absorb
  all gases in the same relative proportion: thus logwood has the
  greatest absorption for ammonia, fustic for carbonic acid, and
  ebony for cyanogen.
     In the <U+FB01>rst Table are given the data from which the amount
  of absorption was deduced in each case.

          LII. Remarks on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.
                       By Jonn TYNDALL, F.R.S.
   To WILL1AM THOMSON, Esq., F.R.S., Professor of Natural
                Philosophy in the University of Glasgow.
     Sm
    HE ’article in ‘ Good Words ’ which drew from me the brief
        remonstrance published in the March Number of the
Philosophical Magazine bore your name, which preceded, though

                      Dynamical Theory ofHe'at.                    369
  not by right of the alphabet, that of Professor Tait. From
  this gentleman’s communication to the Philosophical Maga
  zine of last month, I learn that it was in compliance with
  requests made to you that the article in ‘Good Words’ was
  written.    Indeed, irrespective of these considerations, in any
 article of the kind where your name is associated with that of
  Prof. Tait, you are sure to be regarded as the ‘principal.’
 You are the older and more famous man, and it is your
 behaviour in this controversy, and not that of your colleague,
 which will interest the scienti<U+FB01>c world. I trust, therefore, Prof.
 Tait will see that simple chivalry makes it my duty to decline
 entering into any contest with him at present; and seeing this,
 he will, I doubt not, have the grace and modesty to stand aside
 and allow you and me to settle this affair between ourselves.
     At your request, we are informed, your friend has replied to
 my “Remarks” both for you and for himself. Doubtless his
 reply has passed through your hands and received your assent.
 I may therefore, I hope, regard it as your reply, and deal with it
 accordingly. You open thus :—“I think it right at starting to
 call Prof. Tyndall’s attention to the fact that, in the Philosophical
 Magazine (1862, vol. xxiv. p.65), he has published the following
 words :—‘ I do not think a greater disservice could be done to a
 man of science than to overstate his claims: such overstatement
 is sure to recoil to the disadvantage of him in whose interest it
 is made.’ ” There is surely nothing in these words of which an
 honest man need be ashamed. They are, I submit, sensible
 words; and were they not my words, I should on various grounds
 strongly recommend them to your own particular attention.
 But besides reviving my memory of these words, you remind me
 “that any unpleasant results which may follow from the course
 which he [Prof. Tyndall] has pursued are, by his own acknow
 ledgment, to be laid to his charge.”
    I hope you will forgive me if I now remind you that, in con
ducting this correspondence, it is extremely desirable that each
of us should endeavour to make his meaning clear. This
‘reminder’ of yours is by no means clear. As a deduction it
would be illogical, as an assertion it would be untrue. If in
such a simple matter your writing is made difficult of compre
hension, how am I to seize your meaning when you come to deal
with a really dit<U+FB01>cult subject? Let each of us try then to render
his meaning unmistakeable ; but this once done, let neither of
in seek» to divert the words of the other from their plain and
obvious sense. This course will shorten controversy, and make
the world feel that we mean fairly by each other. In your last
communication you write thus :—“ A journal which contains in
nearly every Number a scienti<U+FB01>c paper by yourself [Sir David

370                 Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on the
_Brewster,< to whom Prof. Tait addresses his communication],
Forbes, Herschel, or Piazzi Smyth, can surely not be regarded as
unsuitable for a paper on ‘ Energy.’ ” Did I say it was ? Did I not
rather state that it was both laudable and desirable that men in
your high positions should instruct the readers of ‘Good Words; ’
and I may here add, what I am known to have stated a hundred
times, that in my opinion it would be an incalculable boon to En
glish society if our best men could be prevailed upon to write our
scienti<U+FB01>c manuals, and to teach the public through our leading
magazines. But I also said, and I think rightly, that ‘Good
Words’ is not the place to give vent to insinuations prejudicial
to the character of a scienti<U+FB01>c fellow-worker. And inasmuch
a I know that the character you impugn is of a quality
to def all your attacks, if only openly made, it is only natural
that I’ should invite you to make your charges against it in
the presence of a jury competent to understand your evi
dence.
     With regard to the publication of my lecture on Force, the
course pursued was this: the abstract of the lecture was pub
lished, as all such abstracts are, in the ‘ Proceedings of the Royal
Institution,’ and it was transferred thence to the Philosophical
 Magazine. With its further publication I had nothing whatever
 to do. Until you informed me of the fact, I did not know that
the lecture had been honoured by admission into the ‘ Illustrated
 London News,’ the ‘Engineer,’ and ‘ Macmillan’s Magazine.’
 The gentleman whom you denominate my ‘pupil’ is quite un
 known to me. But even had I written my abstract expressly
 for any of these journals, there would, I submit, be nothing
 unworthy or inconsistent in the act; for the lecture contains
 imputations

 suffering man to the position which I believed his labours en
 titled him to occupy, and from which I am persuaded your efforts
 will be unavailing to remove him.
     In proof of your acquaintance with Mayer, you refer me to a
 paper of yours in the Edinburgh Transactions, in which I am
 informed you give him “the full credit that his scienti<U+FB01>c claims
 can possibly be admitted to deserve.” This is an assertion made
 without knowledge.         Regarding Mayer-’s labours you knew, I
 assume, what everybody knew-—the contents of his <U+FB01>rst paper,
 which, able and important as it is, is in reality nothing more than
 a preliminary note*. Everybody was acquainted with this paper,
     * “ To secure what I had discovered against eventualities, I ut together
  its most important portions in a short paper, whichl sent to iebig in the
  spring of 1842, with a request that it might be published in the Armalm

                    Dynamical Theory ofHeat.                          371
because it was published in Liebig’s Annalen ; and had Mayer’s
subsequent memoirs been published in the same way, I do not
think you would ever have ventured _to provoke this controversy.
The contributions from which, in connexion with his <U+FB01>rst one,
Mayefs merit as a philosopher is to be inferred, were published
as se arate essays at Heilbronn. To these essays you never refer,
and rom your silence I charitably inferred your ignorance of their
contents. This, however, does not satisfy you. And yet if I
assume that you are acquainted with these memoirs, how am I
to reconcile your knowledge with your silence?
   You have thought it necessary to refresh my memory on an
other point which I should willingly have allowed to remain at
rest. “Prof. Tyndall,” you say, “is most unfortunate in the
possession of a mental bias which often prevents him (as, for
instance, in the case of Rendu and Glacier-motion) from recogni
zing the fact that the claims of individuals whom he supposes to
have been wronged* have, before his intervention, been fully ven
tilated, discussed, and settled by the general award of scienti<U+FB01>c
men.” This language, as applied to Mayer, can only spring
from ignorance; and as regards Rendu, it would be wise in you
to remember that your opinions on this matter are not those of
the world. Even among your own countrymen there are persons
too just and too free to be warped by a misnamed patriotism,
who, in common with the great majority of its readers in other
lands, consider that in my work upon the Alps the claims of Rendu
have been for the <U+FB01>rst time fairly set forth. No man, however, can
be less persuaded_of his own infallibility than I am of mine, and
 I clearly see the possibility of my having greatly erred in my
 writings upon glaciers. But I am willing at all events to bring
 my deeds to the light, so that, whether good or evil, they may be
 made manifest. I have now, to request you to refer me to the
 passages of my writings on Rendu and Glacier-motion which
 establish the unfortunate mental bias you have ascribed to me.
    It may shorten our correspondence, by making re<U+FB02>exion the
precursor of expression, if I here assure you that it is my <U+FB01>xed
 intention not to permit random assertions to stand in this dis
cussion. What you have the hardihood to af<U+FB01>rm, you certainly
must have the goodness to prove or the manliness to retract. I
ask your proof, then, of the assertion you have made regarding
Rendu and Glacier-motion.
 der Chemie und Pharmacie.     It is to belifound in vol. xlii. page 233 of
 the Annalen under the title ‘ Bemerkungen iiber die Krafte der unbelebten
 Natur.’ ” (Mayer, Bemerkungen iiber das mechanische Equivalent der
 Wiirme. Heilbronn and Leipzig, 1851.)
   * I did not suppose Mayer to be wronged: I supposed simply that he
 had wronged himself by his method of publication.

 3’/"2’               Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on the
     After disposing of the matters to which I have had thus far
 occasion to refer, apparently much to your own satisfaction, you
 put the following pointed question :—“ Does Professor Tyndall
 know that Mayer’s paper has no claims to novelty or correctness
 at all, saving this, that by a lucky chance he got an approxima
 tion to a true result from an utterly false analogy”? I am
 able with the utmost sincerity of heart to avow that I did not
 know anything of the kind, and that you are the <U+FB01>rst man
 who has furnished me with this information. I should doubtless
 stand abashed and confounded at my convicted ignorance were
 it not that I <U+FB01>nd myself surrounded by an extremely respectable
 company who are actually as ill-informed as myself. Permit me
 to illustrate my meaning. In a discourse delivered at K6nigs
 berg on the 7th of February, 1854, Prof. Helmholtz analyses
 that relationship of natural forces which he, in 1847, called the
 Conservation of Force—a phrase to which you object as inconve
 nient and erroneous, but which means the same thing as the
phrase ‘Conservation of Energy’ which you adopt. This con
 servation Helmholtz showed to follow directly from the negation
 of a perpetual motion; and it is with reference to this great
principle that he expresses himself in the following words*:—
“ The <U+FB01>rst man who correctly perceived and rightly enunciated
the general law of nature (das allyemeine Naturgesetz) which we
are here considering, was a German physician, J. R. Mayer, of
Heilbronn, in the year 1842. A little later (in 1843) a Dane
named Colding presented a memoir to the Academy of Copen
hagen, in which the same law was enunciated. . . . . In England
Joule began about the same time to make experiments on the
same subject.” You say that you “never intended to hint that
Prof. Tyndall could have meant to put Mayer forward as having
any claims to this great generalization.” Bad as I am, you
would not think of charging me with this grotesque folly. And
still for nine years Helmholtz, who was a master in this <U+FB01>eld
before you ever entered it, has stood self-convicted of this very
absurdity.
     Let me now refer you to another of my companions in igno
rance. On the 7th and 21st of February, 1862, two lectures
on the Mechanical Theory of Heat were given by M. Verdet
before the Chemical Society of Paris-I-. This philosopher, to
whom everybody has hitherto ascribed a thorough knowledge of
the literature of science, expresses himself on the subject in hand
in the following words:—-“ Finally, I will terminate this <U+FB01>rst
part of my historic review by calling to mind that M. Séguin, in
   "‘ Ueber die Wechselwirkung der Naturkriifte. Kiinigsberg. Phil. Mag.
vol. xi. p. 489.
   “f Expose’ de la The'orie Mecaniqzte de la Clmleur, par M. Verdet.

                       Dynamical Theory of Heat.                          373
 9. work published in 1839, and devoted more to political economy
 than to physics, has presented considerations regarding the
 steam-engine which closely resemble those by which I endea
 voured, in our <U+FB01>rst lecture, to make you comprehend the trans
 formation of heat into mechanical power.”
     I should deem it probable that M. Verdet knows as much
 about the labours of M. Séguin as you do, and he certainly
 knows more about those of Mayer. But he does not see in the
 former the annihilation of the latter. He proceeds thus:—
 “I now come to the researches which from 1842 to 1849 de<U+FB01>
 nitely founded the science.      These researches are the exclusive
 work of three men, who without concert, and even without know
 ing each other, arrived simultaneously in almost the same manner
 at_ the same ideas. The priority in the order of publication
 belongs without any doubt to the German physician Jules Robert
 Mayer, whose name has occurred so often in these lectures; and
 it is interesting to know that it was by re<U+FB02>ecting on certain ob
 servations in his medical practice that be perceived the necessity.
 of an equivalence between work and heat. . . . . He perceived in
 the act of respiration the origin of the motive power of animals ;
and the comparison of animals with thermic engines afterwards
 suggested to him the important principle with which his name
will be connected for ever. . . . . We also <U+FB01>nd,” continues M.
Verdet, “in the same memoir (Liebig’s Annalen, 1842) a <U+FB01>rst
determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat, deduced
from the properties of gases, which is perfectly exact in prin
ciple*.” You see then that I am not the only person who has
failed to arrive at your remarkable conclusion that “Mayer’s
paper has no claims to novelty or correctness at al .”
     After referring to M. Colding, M. Verdet passes on to Mr.
Joule. “The third inventor,” he says, “ of whom it remains for
me to speak is Mr. Joule, who perhaps has done most for the
 demonstration of the principle and for its <U+FB01>nal adoption. His
<U+FB01>rst investigation, published only in 1843, is incontestably poste- I
rior by some months to the <U+FB01>rst publications of Mayer and
Colding'|'. All this is certainly very much at variance with your
statement in ‘ Good Woods.’ “Curiously enough,” you there say,
“ although similar coincidences are common, while Joule was pur
suing and publishing his investigations, there appeared in Ger
   * Page 116.
   1' Though the history of the subject compels him to write thus, M.
Verdet recognizes in the most explicit manner the merits of Mr. Joule.
After giving an account of Joule’s experiments, he thus addresses his
audience :--“ Vous ne refuserez pas is voir dans lc travail aujourd’hui clas
sique de M. Joule le preuve expérimeritale de l’exactitude des nouveaux
principes.” (P. 20.)
    Phil. May. S. 44. Vol. 25. No. 169. May 1863.                 2 C

374               Prof. Tyndall's Remarks on the
many a paper by Mayer, of Heilbronn. Its title is ‘Bemerkungen
iiber die Krafte der unbelebten Natur,’ and its date is 1842.”
Would you have the goodness to point out a single word regard
ing the mechanical value of heat, or the mechanical equivalent of
heat in any of Mr. Joule’s writings prior to the month of Decem
ber 1843?     If no such word occurs, if Helmholtz and Verdet be
correct in assigning this date to the earliest experiments of Mr.
Joule on the ‘Mechanical Value of Heat,’ how am I to characterize
your statement that it was while Joule was pursuing and pub
lishing his investigations that Mayer’s paper, dated May 1842,
appeared? If you should urge that these investigations led Mr.
Joule to his experiments on the mechanical equivalent of heat,
you simply repeat what I have myself stated in the very lecture
which has been the object of your unwarrantable attack.
_ With reference to the manner in which I have met your insi
nuations in my brief communication to the Philosophical Maga
zine, we have the following remarks z—‘‘ I am unwilling to enter
upon matters of a more personal character, but it is impossible
to pass over the fact that, in answer to an expostulation from
Joule (having reference to this lecture), Prof. Tyndall referred
 (Phil. Mag. 1862, second half year, p. 1 73) to statements which he
had made in a course of lectures which, he now tells us, were com
pleted before he acquired those views of Mayer’s claims to which
Joule so naturally objected, and that he now replies to Prof.
Thomson and me, not by showing that his lecture, to which We
referred, was free from the objections which we urged against it,
but by showing that these objections could not be urged against
a certain statement which he quotes from a work, not published,
but promised for publication.” This reads smart ,- but my frame
of mind disquali<U+FB01>es me from meeting it with mere smartness.
In replying to it I do not forget that my aim must not be to
satisfy you as to the uprightuess of my course of action, but to
enable the scienti<U+FB01>c public to judge between your actions and
mine. On my return from Switzerland in 1862, I became
acquainted with the “ expostulation ” to which you refer; and I
also found waiting for me a private letter from Mr. Joule, remind
ing me of what he had done in connexion with this subject. In
one of my morning lectures given six months previously, I had
recognized in the strongest terms the claims of Mr. Joule on the
very points to which, in his private note, he had directed my
attention. In my answer to his “expostulation ” I quoted this
lecture, not expecting that Mr. Joule ought to be satis<U+FB01>ed with
a statement made six months before, but for the purpose of
publicly renewing the value of that statement by resubscription
to it. This was done in the following words addressed to Mr.
Joule :—“ Such has been my language regarding you, and to it

                   _ Dynamical Theory of Heat.                #75
I still adhere: I trust you <U+FB01>nd nothing in it which indicates a
desire on my part to question your claim to the honour of being
the experimental demonstrator of the equivalence of heat and
work.” It was in the presence of this statement that you ven
tured to insinuate in ‘ Good Words ’ your charge of depreciation
and suppression; and it is in the presence of this statement,
requoted for your especial information in the March Number of
the Philosophical Magazine, that you now dare to reiterate this
charge. The quotation from my book will be recognized by the
court before which you and I now stand, as springing from the
 same spirit of goodwill towards Mr. Joule, and the same high
appreciation of his services which have marked all that I have
said and written regarding him. It is not only ‘now’ that I
 entertain those feelings, as you intimate in your concluding pa
 ragraph, they have always been mine ; and they will continue to
 be mine despite an advocacy on your part so unwise and so un
 warranted as to be well calculated to produce a reaction against
 the man who is unfortunate enough to <U+FB01>nd in you the assertor
of his claims.
     Your article in ‘ Good Words’ was professedly written to
 counteract the errors and absurdities of previous writers. “We
 have aimed,” you say, “ at preparing an article which shall at
 all events be accurate as far as human knowledge now reaches,”
 01' as you more cuttingly express it in reference to my poor
 lecture, you “seized the opportunity of distributing among its
  [‘ Good Words ’] 120,000 readers a corrective to the erroneous
 information which you saw stealing upon them through the
 medium of popular journals.” Well, let us inquire a little into
 the quality of the “ corrective.” In putting Mr. Joule forward
 as the founder of the dynamical theory of heat, you write thus :—
  “In 1843 he (Mr. Joule) published the results of a well-planned
 and executed series of experiments, by which be ascertained that
 a pound of water is raised one degree Fahrenheit in temperature
  by 772 foot-pounds of mechanical work done upon it. In other
  words, if a pound of water fall from a height of 772 feet, and
  the kinetic energy thus acquired in the form of ordinary motion
 be entirely transformed into the kinetic energy of heat, the
  water will be one degree hotter than before its fall.” You here
  prove yourself to be as ill-informed regarding the labours of
  Joule as you are regarding those of Mayer. It was in 1849,
  and not in 1843, that Mr. Joule proved the mechanical equiva
  lent of heat to be 772 foot-pounds. His determinations of the
  mechanical equivalent of heat, published in l843, varied from
  1040 to 587 foot-pounds. They were so discordant that nobody
  attached any value to them. It was with reference to Mr. Joule’s
  earlier experiments that Helmholtz expressed himself thus, in
                                2 C 2

 376                  Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on the
 his celebrated essay ‘ Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft,’ published
 in 1847 :—“ Joule has examined the quantities of heat generated
 by the friction of water in narrow tubes, and in a vessel in which
 the water was set in motion by a kind of turbine. He has
 found in the <U+FB01>rst case that the heat which raises 1 lb. of water
 1° C. would lift 452 kilogrammes to the height of 1 metre;
 in the second case he found the weight to be 521 kilogrammes.
 Nevertheless his methods of experiment correspond too little to
 the dif<U+FB01>culties of the investigation to allow of these results having
 the least claim to accuracy ” * (als dass diese Resultate iryendwie
 auf Genauiykeit Anspruch machen kiinnten). I translated this
 paper myself for the ‘ Scienti<U+FB01>c Memoirs 1*,’ and was careful to
 append to this passage a note to the effect that Helmholtz when
 he wrote thus was only acquainted with the earlier experiments
 of Mr. Joule. Judged on broad and liberal grounds, Mr. Joule
 is worthy of such praise as rarely falls to the lot of a philosopher.
 He is, in my opinion, the true experimental demonstrator of the
 dynamical theory of heat. But to write as you write regarding
 his <U+FB01>rst experiments is simply to betray a want of acquaintance
 with the requirements of re<U+FB01>ned experimental inquiry.
     You state in ‘ Good Words’ that Mayer’s hypothesis is at best
only “approximately” true for air. Yes; but the approximation
is so close that it cost Mr. Joule six years of labour, according
to his own methods, to arrive at the degree of accuracy attain
able by the method of Mayer. You coldly deny to Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst
paper all claim to novelty or correctness; and yet a comparison
of that paperi with the <U+FB01>rst part of your “ corrective” in ‘ Good
Words’ will show that the ideas which you have there enunci
ated are the ideas of Mayer. The very illustration which you
employ, of stirring water in a basin to produce heat, is an experi
ment of Mayer’s mentioned in this <U+FB01>rst paper. In the subse
quent portion of the article referred to, you come to what you
denominate “ the grandest question of all.” You put it thus :—
“ Whence do we immediately derive all those stores of potential
energy which we employ as fuel or food? What produces the
potential energy of a loaf or a beefsteak? What supplies the
coal and the water-power without which our factories must stop?”
These “ grandest questions of all” were asked and answered by
Dr. Mayer seventeen years before you wrote your article; and
yet you never mention his name§. You proceed, “ Whence
does the sun produce the energy which he so continuously and
   “‘ See also Verdet, pp. 91 & 165.             'i' 1853.

 liberally distributes? ” You then consider the various hypotheses
  framed to account for the permanence of solar emission, and
  develope the meteoric theory of the sun’s heat. Mayer did the
  same fourteen years before you wrote this article in ‘Good Words,’
  and six years before you published your earliest paper on the sub
 ject in the Edinburgh Transactions. There is not an idea of any
  originali-ty in the whole of that paper that is not to be found in the
  memoirs of Mayer; and yet you do not give him an iota of credit
  in this article of yours in ‘ Good Words,’ the accuracy of which
  you have so trumpeted forth. Mayer, moreover, went further
  than you did, and showed that the heat produced by tidal friction
  must be generated at the expense of the earth’s rotation. This
  is but an episode in Mayer’s ‘Essay on Celestial Dynamics,’
  but it is eminently illustrative of the clear glance which this
  hard-working physician had obtained into the system of nature.
  Here was a phenomenon which had been for centuries the sub
 ject of observation, measurement, and calculation; still no astro
 nomer, no mathematician, no natural philosopher perceived its
 inevitable mechanical effect. But Mayer, following out his
 own principles, saw and enunciated that the motion of the tides,
 inde<U+FB01>nitely continued, must <U+FB01>nally stop the earth’s rotation.
 Name, if you can the “ mathematician or naturalist, from Galileo
 to Davy,” who ever “elaborated” these things. You cannot
 do so ; and while science lives, the name of Mayer will be asso
 ciated with these questions. In the presence of such facts, it ill
 becomes you to talk to me of suppression and depreciation.
 You may send your statements into the world labelled ‘Good
 WVords,’ but the world before which you and I now stand will
 see that the “trade mark” is incorrect ; that if to be pitiful, if
 to be courteous, if to cherish that charity which thinketh no
 evil, be the marks of goodness, these utterances of yours are not
 good words, but the reverse. Judged of by the facts, and apart
 from your own uninformed convictions, they are not even words

     In your last communication you anticipated “ unpleasant
 results,” and, doubtless, taking it for granted that the unplea
 santness was to be all on my side, you were good enough to
 inform me (still by anticipation) that I had only myself to
 blame. Certainly it is in the highest degree unpleasant to
me to be compelled to write as I have here written. It wastes
that commodity which to me is the most precious of all—my
time, and it stirs up feelings between you and me which I
would make any sacri<U+FB01>ce consistent with self-respect to annul.

378               Prof. Tyndall's Remarks on the
But the responsibility is yours. No taint of personality is to be
found in anything that I have ever written regarding you; even
when facts were against you I held my peace. When I wrote
my brief and temperate remonstrance to the Philosophical
Magazine, all that I have stated in this letter was known to
me. I then knew, as well as I do now, that your treatment
of Mayer could not bear the light of criticism; still my remon
strance breathed no syllable of accusation. My desire was to
clear myself, and not to criminate you, trusting that the trans
lations of Mayer’s works now appearing in the Philosophical
Magazine would in due time set public opinion right regarding
him. I hoped that good sense and gentlemanly feeling would
so far predominate as to induce you to withdraw an accusation
which, though vaguely uttered, was offensive. Had you done
so, this discussion would have perished in the bud, and I should
never have written a sentence which could be personally dis
agreeable to you. But instead of withdrawing your accusation,
you repeat it, and thus compel me in self-defence to lay a true
statement of the case before the scienti<U+FB01>c public, and invoke its
judgment between us.
                           I have the honour to be, Sir,
                                       Your obedient Servant,
                                                   JOHN TYNDALL.
    I have studied Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst memoir attentively, and am
unable to affix a de<U+FB01>nite meaning to the statement of Prof.
Thomson that it was “by a lucky chance he got a true result
from an utterly false analogy.” The object of Mayer’s paper,
as he himself informs us, is to give to our ideas of “ force” the
same precision as to our ideas of “matter.” He <U+FB01>nds in the
universe two systems of causes, from the one to the other of which
there is no transition ; the members of the one system possess the
attributes of ponderability and impenetrability, those of the other
system do not ; the one consists of the different kinds of mat
ter, the other of the different manifestations of force.    The <U+FB01>rst
quality of all causes he affirms to be indestructibility (Unzerstb'r
liclzkeit). A force cannot become nothing; and just as little can
a force be produced from nothing. Forces, he af<U+FB01>rms, are inde
structible and convertible, different forms of one and the same
object. When a force has wrought an effect equal to itself, it
ceases by that act to have an existence. A weight resting upon
the earth is not a force; it is incapable of producing motion,
incompetent, for example, to lift another weight. A raised
weight is a force (potential energy); a falling weight which
possesses motion (dynamic energy) is a force. The <U+FB01>rst force,
which consisted simply in the separation of the weight from the

                     Dynamical Theory of Heat.                     379
earth, and where no motion is involved, is converted, when the
weight is liberated, into the force of motion.                         '
   But we see, proceeds Mayer, in numberless cases motion
destroyed without producing other motion, or without raising
any weight: now a force once in existence cannot become nil;
hence the question arises, under what other form does the
vanished motion make its appearance? Here experiment alone
can help us. We must choose materials which, while they
enable us to destroy motion, will themselves undergo the least
alteration possible. (The precision with which Mayer here
de<U+FB01>nes the conditions of experiment is worthy of notice; he
intends the motion to produce heat, and therefore he avoids
changes of aggregation.) When we rub together two plates of
metal, we see that motion disappears, but we also see heat
make its appearance; and the question now is, is the motion
the cause of the heat? In the numberless cases in which motion
is destroyed and heat generated, has the motion no other effect
than the production of heat? has the heat no other cause than
the motion ?                       '
    Thus clearly and distinctly does this original thinker set his
problem before him, and he arrives at the conclusion that, with
out a causal connexion between motion and heat, we can neither
account for the disappearance of the one nor the appearance of
the other. He <U+FB01>nds that by stirring water vigorously he can
warm it. In what follows, Mayer-’s power of generalization comes
conspicuously into play. He remarks that heat makes its appea1'
ance when the particles of a body approach each other; conden
sation generates heat. But what is true for the ultimate parti
cles is also true for larger masses. The falling of a body to the
earth is actually a diminution of the earth’s volume, and must
certainly stand in connexion with the heat generated by the fall.
This heat is proportional to the mass of the body and the distance
through which it has fallen. It is also proportional to the mass
multiplied by the square of its velocity*. In water-mills the
motion produced by the diminution of the earth’s volume by the
fall of the water generates continually a considerable amount of
heat. Conversely, the steam-engine serves to decompose the
heat into motion, or the lifting of weights. The locomotive
with its train may be compared to a distilling apparatus. The
heat beneath the boiler transforms itself into motion, and this
motion again deposits itself as heat in the axles and the wheels.
 (It would be impossible to <U+FB01>nd a happier comparison than this.)
    * I would invite the reader to compare this outline of Mayer’s paper
 with the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve columns of Prof. Thomson’s article in ‘Good _Words‘
 (October 1862), and thus to prove for himself whether I am right or
 wrong when I state that these <U+FB01>ve columns deal substantially with the
 work of Mayer.                                             '

380                Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on the
Water changes to team in the boiler; the steam is reconverted
into water in the condenser; the water and the steam are differ
ent forms of the same thing. The quantity of steam which con
denses is, moreover, neither more nor less than what the boiler
yields. So also the heat of the furnace passes into the visible
motion
into      of atlthe
       heat  the train         visible
                       ; this and
                     wheels             motion
                                    axles; heat again transforms
                                                               likeitself
                                                 and motion,         the
 steam and water, are merely different forms of the same thing
 (verschiedene Erscheinungsformen eines und dessclben Objects).
 And inasmuch as we have in the condenser neither more nor
 less of steam than the boiler yielded, so in the wheels and axles
 we have, as heat, all the motion, no more and no less, expended
 by the furnace to give velocity to the train.
    Had Mayer paused at this illustration and not written another
 word, he would have proved himself, as regards the conservation
of energy, in advance of every living man in 1842*. But he went
 further. Having thus given an outline of his principles, be con
 cludes his paper by what he calls a “practical deduction.” To
 express numerically the relations of force and motion in the case
 of gravity, it is necessary, he says, to determine experimentally
 the distance through which a body falls in a given time, say in
 the <U+FB01>rst second of its fall. So likewise as regards the relation
 between motion and heat, we must determine the quantity of
 heat which corresponds to a certain quantity of motion. We
 must, for example, determine how high a de<U+FB01>nite weight must be
 raised above the earth’s surface so that its fall to the earth shall
 be equivalent to the warming of an equal weight of water
 1° C. That such an equation is founded in nature, Mayer
 regards as the résumé of his paper. The term ‘equivalent’ is
 here used by Mayer for the <U+FB01>rst time, and his next act is to in
 dicate how it may be determined numerically, and to give the
result of the calculation. In making this calculation be employed
the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air, which was at that time accepted as the
most correct. Subsequently the re<U+FB01>ned experiments of M.
 Regnault proved the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air to be somewhat less
than what the determinations prior to 1842 had made it. Sub
stituting in Mayer’s formula the corrected speci<U+FB01>c heat, we
obtain a number which is almost identical with the mean of all
the best determinations of Mr. Joule.
    ‘ The relative ripeness of the ideas of Dr. Mayer and Mr. Joule
twenty years ago may be inferred from a comparison of the above
remarks published in May 1842, with the following passage <U+FB01>rst pub
lished by Mr. Joule in December 1843 :—-“I shall lose no time in repeat
ing and extending these experiments, bein satis<U+FB01>ed that the grand agents
of nature are, by the Creator’s <U+FB01>at, ingestructible, and that wherever
mechanical force is expended, an exact equivalent of heat is always
obtained.’

                     Dynamical Theory ofHeat.                     381
    Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst paper does not contain the details of the calcu
lation ; but in his second paper, published in 1845, he formally
goes through it. In my ‘ Lectures on Heat’ 1 have tried to put
this subject into its most elementary form ; and as many persons
may take an interest in this discussion who are not conversant
either with the details or history of the mechanical theory of heat,
I will ask permission to make a quotation f1'om the work referred
to. In calculating the mechanical equivalent of heat, while using
my own language I strictly adhere to the method of Mayer.             _
    “ Let C be a cylindrical vessel with a base one square foot in
area. Let P P mark the upper surface of a cubic P.
foot of air at a temperature of 32° Fahr. The I """" "1’            ,
height AP will then be 1 foot. Let the air be heated                i
till its volume is doubled; to e<U+FB01>ect this it must,                  i
as before explained, he raised 273° C. or 490° F. 1>1—-—--1»
in temperature; and when expanded, its upper
 surface will stand at P’ P’, one foot above its initial
position. But in rising from P P to P'P' it has
forced back the atmosphere, which exerts a pres B_____—=A
sure of 15 lbs. on every square inch of its upper
 surface ; in other words, it has lifted a weight of 144 x l5=2160
 lbs. to a height of 1 foot.
     “The ‘capacity’ for heat of the air thus expanding is 0'24,
 water being unity; the weight of our cubic foot of air is 1'29 oz. ;
 hence the quantity of heat required to raise 1'29 oz. of air 490° F.
 would raise a little less than one-fourth of that weight of water
 490°. The exact quantity of water equivalent to our 1'29 oz. of
 air is 1'29 xO'24= 0'31 oz.
     “But 0'31 oz. of water heated 490° is equal to 152 ozs., or ‘
 9% lbs. heated 1°.     Thus the heat imparted to our cubic foot of
 air, in order to double its volume and enable it to lift a weight
 of 2160 lbs. 1 foot high, would be competent to raise 94 lbs. of
  water one degree in temperature.
     “ The air has here been heated under a constant pressure ; and we
  have learned that the quantity of heat necessary to raise the
 temperature of a gas under constant pressure a certain number
  of degrees, is to that required to raise the gas to the same tem
 perature, when its volume is kept constant, in the proportion of
  1'42 to 1 ; hence we have the statement,
                     1'42 : 1=9'5 lbs. : 6'7 lbs.,
  which shows that the quantity of heat necessary to augment the
  temperature of our cubic foot of air at constant volume 490°
  would heat 6'7 lbs. of water 1°.
     “Deducting 6'7lbs. from 9'5lbs.,we <U+FB01>nd that the excess ofheat
  imparted to the air, in the case where it is permitted to expand,
  is competent to raise 2'8 lbs. of water 1° F. in temperature.

382                Prof. Tyndall’s Remarksion the
   "As explained already, this excess is employed to lift the weight
of 2160 lbs. 1 foot high. Dividing 2160 by 2'8, we <U+FB01>nd that
the quantity of heat su<U+FB02>icient to raise 1 lb. of water 1° Fahr. in
temperature is competent to raise aweightof 771 '4 lbs.a foot high.
   “ This method of calculating the mechanical equivalent of heat
was followed by Dr. Mayer, a physician in Heilbronn, Germany,
in the spring of 1842.
   “ Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst paper contains merely an indication of the way
in which he had found the equivalent, but does not contain the
calculation. The paper was evidently a kind of preliminary note
from which date might be taken. In it were enunciated the con
vertibility and indestructibility of force, and its author referred
to the mechanical equivalent of heat merely in illustration of his
principles. Had this <U+FB01>rst paper stood alone, Mayer’s relation
to the dynamical theory of heat would be very different from
what it now is; but in 1845 he published an ‘Essay on Organic
Motion,’ which, though exception might be taken to it here and
there, is, on the whole, a production of extraordinary merit.
This was followed in 1848 by an ‘Essay on Celestial Dynamics,’
in which, with remarkable boldness, sagacity, and completeness,
he developed the meteoric theory of the sun. Taking him all in
all, the right of Mayer to stand, as a man of true genius, in the
front rank of the founders of the dynamical theory of heat, can
not be disputed.”
 ' For the sake of completeness, I will append here the resume’
which I have given of the determinations of Mr. Joule.
   “ On August 21, 1843, Mr. Joule communicated a paper to the
British Association, then meeting at Cork, and in the third part
of this paper* he describes a series of experiments on magneto
electricity, executed with a view to determine the ‘mechanical
value of the heat.’ The results of this elaborate investigation
gave the following weights raised one foot high as equivalent to
the warming of 1 lb. of water 1° Fahr. :—
              1.    896 lbs.               5.    1026 lbs.
              2. 1001 ,,                   6.      587 ,,

              4.     910 ,,                8.      860 ,,
    “ In 1844 Mr. Joule deduced from experiments on the conden
sation of air, the following equivalents to 1 lb. of water heated
1° Fahr. :—
                         823 foot-pounds.
                          795      ,,

                      Dynamical Theory of Heat.                383
   "‘ As the experience of the experimenter increased, we <U+FB01>nd that
the coincidence of his results becomes closer. In 1845 Mr.
Joule deduced from experiments with water agitated by a paddle
wheel an equivalent of
                           890 foot-pounds.
   “Summing up his results in 1845, and taking the mean, he
found the equivalent to be
                           817 foot-pounds.
   “ In 1847 he found the mean of two experiments to give as
equivalent
                           781'8 foot-pounds.
    “ Finally, in 1849, applying all the precautions suggested by
seven years’ experience, he obtained the following numbers for
the mechanical equivalent of heat :
       772'692 from friction of water, mean of 40 experiments.
       774083           ,,         mercury,   ,, 50       J!
       774987           ,,        cast iron,  ,, 20       ,,
    “ For reasons assigned in his paper, Mr. Joule <U+FB01>xes the exact
 equivalent of heat at
                            772 foot-pounds.
    “ According to the method pursued by Mayer in 1842, the me
 chanical equivalent of heat is
                           7714 foot-pounds.
    “ Such a coincidence relieves the mind of every shade of uncer
 tainty regarding the correctness of our present mechanical equi
 valent of heat.”
    It was in connexion with this resume that I wrote the follow
 ing paragraph, which has been already quoted in the Philoso
 phical Magazine.
    “Do I refer to these things in order to exalt Mayer at the
 expense of Joule? It is far from my intention to do so. The
 man who through long years, without encouragement, and in the
 face of difficulties which might well be deemed insurmountable,
 could work with such unswerving steadfastness of purpose to so
 triumphant an issue, is safe from depreciation. And it is not
 the experiments alone, but the spirit which they incorporate, and
 the applications which their author made of them, that entitle
 Mr. Joule to a place in the foremost rank of physical philoso
 phers. Mayer’s labours have in some measure the stamp of a
 profound intuition, which rose, however, to the energy of un
 doubting conviction in the author’s mind. Joule’s labours, on
 the contrary, are an experimental demonstration. True to the
 speculative instinct of his country, Mayer drew large and weighty

  3841                Prof. Tyndall’s Remarks on the
  conclusions from slender premises ; while the Englishman aimed,
  above all things, at the <U+FB01>rm establishment of facts.         And he did
  .establish them.     The future historian of science will not, I think,
  place these men in antagonism. To each belongs -a reputation
  which will not quickly fade, for the share he has had, not only
  in establishing the dynamical theory of heat, but also in leading
  the way towards a right appreciation of the general energies of
  the universe.”
       It will be observed that Mayer implies in his calculation that
  the excess of heat imparted to the gas when it expands under
  constant pressure is all consumed in the lifting of the weight,
  that there is none of it expended in overcoming the mutual
  attractions of the gaseous molecules. Whether Mayer, at the
  time he made his calculation, had really <U+FB01>xed his attention on
  the possibility of some of the heat being consumed in surmounting
  these attractions does not appear from his <U+FB01>rst paper; all that
  appears there is, that he <U+FB01>xed upon a substance (atmospheric
  air) which was capable of giving a correct result. There were,
  moreover, existing at the time data which made it all but certain
  that atmospheric air was a body of this character. It obeyed
 the law of Mariette, its density being through a large range pro
 portional to the external pressure. If the condensation of the air
 had been in part due to the mutual action of its own atoms—
 if the external pressure and internal attractions had been thus com
 plicated—it is all but certain that the law of Mariotte could not
 have been obeyed. Besides, the same law applied to hydrogen as
 to air; hence if the atoms exercised any sensible in<U+FB02>uence upon
 each other, the hydrogen atoms must be assumed to act precisely
 in the same manner as the oxygen atoms. It would also have to
 be assumed that the action of two molecules of the same gas
 exert precisely the same action upon each other as two molecules
 of di<U+FB01>erent gases*. Gay-Lussac’s experiments had, moreover,
 proved that in the expansion of air, where no external work was
performed, no heat was absorbed, which could not be the case if
 molecular attractions had to be overcome. In short, con<U+FB01>ning
ourselves to the data known in 1842, the hypothesis that any
sensible portion of the heat communicated to the air is applied
 to the overcoming of internal attractions is cumbe1'ed with diffi
culties and improbabilities su<U+FB02>icient to justify its instant rejec
tion. How far Mayer entered into these considerations in 1842
we know not 3 all that we know is, that what he did was correct.
It is not a “ reconstruction or destruction of thermo-dynamics ”
that those considerations involve, but simply a reconstruction of
Professor William Thomson’s ideas regarding Dr. Mayer1'.
    * On this point see also Verdet, p. 44.
   ‘l’ If my knowledge be correct, the circumstances which might affect the

                       Dynamical Theory of Heat.‘                         385
    One point more remains to be considered. Prof. Thomson
denies everything to Mayer save a combination of a lucky chance
and a false analogy; and he asks me, do I not know “that even
on this point he had been anticipated by Séguin, who, three
years before the appearance of Mayer’s paper, had obtained
and published the same numerical result from the same hypo
thesis?” I must frankly confess that I did not know this, nor
am I yet aware of it. It would be a source of lively regret to
me to <U+FB01>nd I had done injustice to M. Séguin. There cannot
be a doubt that he expressed many correct ideas regarding the
transformation of heat into motion in his work Sur l’in_<U+FB02>uence
des chemins de fer, published in 1839, and which ideas he
a<U+FB02>irms that he had derived from his uncle, the celebrated Mont
gol<U+FB01>er. Knowing this, I stated in the preface to my ‘ Lectures’
that he, M. Séguin, stands “in honourable relationship to the
dynamical theory of heat.” I was aware that, at page 389 of the
derivation of the mechanical equivalent of heat from the properties of gases
were <U+FB01>rst clearly laid down by Clausius. In connexion with this point he
writes as follows (Phil. Mag. 1856, vol. xii. p. 242) :—“ In the absence of
more accurate knowledge, it was formerly assumed, in determining the
volumes of the unit of weight of saturated vapour at different temperatures,
that vapour, even at its maximum density, still obeys Mariotte's and Gay
Lussac's laws.    In opposition to this, I have already shown in my <U+FB01>rst
memoir’ on this subject, that the volumes in question can be calculated
from the principles of the mechanical theory of heat, under the assumption
that a permanent gas when it expands at a constant temperature only ab
sorbs so much‘ heat as is consumed in the external work thereby performed,
and that these calculations lead to values which, at least at high tempera
tures, ditfer considerably from Mariotte’s and Gay-Lussac’s laws.
   “ Even the physicists who had occupied themselves more especially with
the mechanical theory of heat did not at that time coincide with this view
of the deportment of vapour. William Thomson in particular opposed it.
In a memoir!‘ presented to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and published
a year later, in March 1851, he only regarded this result as a proof of the
improbability of the above assumption which I had employed.
   “ Since then, however, he and J. P.-Ioule have undertaken to test expe
rimentally the accuracy of this assumption} By a series of well-contrived
experiments, executed on a large scale, they have infact shown that, with
respect to the permanent gases, atmospheric air and hydrogen, the assump
tion is so nearly true, that in most calculations the deviations from exacti
tude may be disregarded. With carbonic acid, the non-permanent gas
they investigated, the deviations were greater. This is in perfect accord
ance with the remark I made on <U+FB01>rst making the assumption, which was
that the latter would probably be found to be accurate in the same measure
as Mariotte’s and Gay-Lussac’s laws were applicable to the gas. In con
sequence of these experiments, Thomson now calculates the volumes of
saturated vapours in the same manner as myself.”

386            Remarks on the Dynamical Theory of Heat.
work referred to, he gave a series of numbers, and that his stre
nuous supporter in putting his claims above those of Mr. Joule,
afterwards pointed out that they contained “implicitly” the
mechanical equivalent of heat. I was aware that in 1847 he
had reduced these numbers so as to express the mechanical
equivalent of heat in the usual form, his determinations vary
ing from 395 to 529 grammes raised to a height of 1 metre.
(That of Mayer, according to the precise calculations of M. Reg
nault, is 426.) I thought, moreover, that M. Séguin had ope
rated upon steam, and that steam, as he used it, could not give
a correct result. I further knew that the intimate friend of
M. Séguin, Mr. Grove, had stated, in a lecture given at the
Royal Institution on Friday, 25th January 1856, that “since
the accurate and elaborate experiments of M. Regnault, M. S6
guin has necessarily varied his estimate, as by those experiments
it appears that, within certain limits, for elevating the tempera
ture of compressed vapour by one degree, no more than about
1-llgths of a degree _of total heat is required; consequently the
equivalent multiplied in this ratio would be 1666 grammes
 instead of 500.” This would be nearly four times Mayer’s equi
valent. Perhaps Prof. Thomson has access to sources of infor
mation which are unknown to me, and therefore I do not presume
to deny his statement that M. Séguin obtained “ the same name
rical result” as Mayer, three years before him. Prof. Thomson
 will no doubt produce his authority.
    But I must here say distinctly that I would not for an instant
allow my estimate of Mayer to depend upon his determination
of the mechanical equivalent of heat. It is the insight which
he had obtained, in advance of all other men, regarding the rela
 tionship of the general energies of the universe, as illustrated
in the whole of his writings, that gives him his claim to my
esteem and admiration*. In 1842, when he published his <U+FB01>rst
   * I am far from saying that Mayer had mastered the entire details and
developments of the conservation of force, or that he is free from error;
but he it was who <U+FB01>rst clearly grasped the philosophy of the subject; and
what was done previous to 1842 is to what Mayer did as twilight is to the
light of day. His equals—possib1y his superiors—have since appeared
upon the <U+FB01>eld; but the generous-minded among them, instead of looking
down upon the man, will acknowledge him as a successful pioneer into a
region which promises possessions richer than any hitherto granted to the
intellect of man. On one point in particular, Mayer, I think, allowed his
caution to cripple his philosophy. He evidently feared having anything
to do with atoms or their motions, and hence could hardly be said to have
realized the complete physical conception of the dynamical theory of heat.
Probably, however, many share his caution, and adhere to the external facts
without seeking to penetrate the molecular actions which underlie them.
It must also be remembered that Mayer’s education was that of a doctor
of medicine, the power of original genius alone enabling him to break
through the limitations which his culture tended to impose.

               Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.            387
short paper in Liebig’s Annalen, he had no equal. In 1845,
when he published his ‘ Organic Motion in connexion with Nu
trition,’ he had, in this <U+FB01>eld, no equal; and in 1848, when he
published his ‘ Celestial Dynamics,’ he was without an equal in
this particular domain. This I state as my profound and deli
berate conviction, but I should be extremely sorry to throw
mud at any man who holds a different belief. Happily the
English public will soon have an opportunity of forming its
own judgment on these matters from the translations of Mayer’s
papers which are now appearing in the Philosophical Magazine.
       L111. On Celestial Dynamics.     By Dr. J. R. l\L1Y1-:11.
                        [Continued from p. 248.]
      HE movements of celestial bodies in an absolute vacuum
        would be as uniform as those of amathematical pendulum,
whereas a resisting medium pervading all space would cause
the planets to move in shorter and shorter orbits, and at last to
 “all into the sun.
    Assuming such a resisting medium, these wandering celestial
bodies must have on the periphery of the solar system their
cradle, and in its centre their grave; and however long the
 duration, and however great the number of their revolutions may
 be, as many masses will on the average in a certain time arrive
 at the sun as formerly in a like period of time came within
 his sphere of attraction.                                       _
    All these bodies plunge with a violent impetus into their
 common grave. Since no cause exists without an effect, each of
 these cosmical masses will, like a weight falling to‘ the earth,
 produce by its percussion an amount of heat proportional to its
 vis viva.
     From the idea of a sun whose attraction acts throughout
 space, of ponderable bodies scattered throughout the universe,
 and of a resisting aether, another idea necessarily follows—that,
 namely, of a continual and inexhaustible generation of heat on
 the central body of this cosmical system.
    Whether such a conception be realized in our solar system
 -—-whether, in other words, the wonderful and permanent evolu
 tion of light and heat be caused by the uninterrupted fall of
 cosmical matter into the sun—will now be more closely examined.
     The existence of matter in a primordial condition (Urmaterie),
 moving about in the universe, and assumed to follow the attrac
 tion of the nearest stellar system, will scarcely be denied by
 astronomers and physicists; for the richness of surrounding
 nature, as well as the aspect of the starry heavens, prevents the
 belief that the wide space which separates our solar system from

 388           Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
 the regions governed by the other <U+FB01>xed stars is a vacant soli
 tude destitute of matter.     We shall leave, however, all supposi
 tions concerning subjects so distant from us both in time and
 space, and con<U+FB01>ne our attention exclusively to what may be
 learnt from the observation of the existing state of things.
     Besides the fourteen known planets with their eighteen satel
 lites, a great many other cosmical masses move within the space
 of the planetary system, of which the comets deserve to be men
 tioned <U+FB01>rst.
     Kepler’s celebrated statement that “there are more comets in
 the heavens than <U+FB01>sh in the ocean,” is founded on the fact that,
 of all the comets belonging to our solar system, comparatively
 few can be seen by the inhabitants of the earth, and there
 fore the not inconsiderable number of actually observed comets
obliges us, according to the rules of the calculus of probabi
lities, to assume the existence of a great many more beyond the
 sphere of our vision.
    Besides planets, satellites, and comets, another class of celestial
 bodies exists within our solar system.     These are masses which,
 on account of their smallness, may be considered as cosmical
 atoms, and which Arago has appropriately called asteroids. They,
like the planets and the comets, are governed by gravity, and
 move in elliptical orbits rou11d the sun. When accident brings
them into the immediate neighbourhood of the earth, they pro
 duce the phenomena of shooting-stars and <U+FB01>reballs.
    It has been shown by repeated observation, that on a bright
night twenty minutes seldom elapse without a shooting-star being
visible to an observer in any situation. At certain times these
meteors are observed in astonishingly great numbers; during
the meteoric shower at Boston, which lasted nine hours, when
they were said to fall “crowded together like snow-<U+FB02>akes,” they
were estimated as at least 240,000.      011 the whole, the number
of asteroids which come near the earth iii the space of a year must
be computed to be many thousands of millions. This, without
doubt, is only a small fraction of the number of asteroids that
move round the sun, which number, according to the rules of
the calculus of probabilities, approaches the in<U+FB01>nite.
   As has been already stated, on the existence of a resisting
sether it depends whether the celestial bodies, the planets, the
comets, and the asteroids move at constant mean distances round
the sun, or whether they are constantly approaching that central
body.
    Scienti<U+FB01>c men do not doubt the existence of such an aether.
Littrow, amongst others, expresses himself on this point as fol
lows :—“ The assumption that the planets and the comets move
in an absolute vacuum can in no way be admitted. Even if the

               Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.            ‘B89
 space between celestial bodies contained no other matter than
 that necessary for the existence of light (whether light be consi
 dered as emission of matter or the undulations of a universal
 aether), this alone is su<U+FB02>icient to alter the motion of the planets
 in the course of time and the arrangement of the whole system
 itself; the fall of all the planets and the comets into the sun and
 the destruction of the present state of the solar system must
 be the <U+FB01>nal result of this action.”
     A direct proof of the existence of such a resisting medium
 has been furnished by the academician Encke. He found that
 the comet named after him, which revolves round the sun in
 the short space of 1207 days, shows a regular acceleration of its
 motion, in consequence of which the time of each revolution is
 shortened by about six hours.
     From the great density and magnitude of the planets, the
 shortening of the diameters of their orbits proceeds, as might be
 expected, very slowly, and is up to the present time inappre
 ciable. The smaller the cosmical masses are, on the contrary,
 other circumstances remaining the same, the faster they move
 towards the sun; it may therefore happen that in a space of time
 wherein the mean distance of the earth from the sun would
 diminish one metre, a small asteroid would travel more than one
 thousand miles towards the central body.
     As cosmical masses stream from all sides in immense numbers
towards the sun, it follows that they must become more and more
 crowded together as they approach thereto. The conjecture at
 once suggests itself that the zodiacal light, the nebulous light
 of vast dimensions which surrounds the sun, owes its origin to
 such closely-packed asteroids. However it may be, this much is
 certain, that this phenomenon is caused by matter which moves
 according to the same laws as the planets round the sun, and
it consequently follows that the whole mass which originates the
zodiacal light is continually approaching the sun and falling into
it.
    This light does not surround the sun uniformly on all sides ;
that is to say, it has not the form of a sphere, but that of a thin
convex lens, the greater diameter of which is in the plane of the
solar equator, and accordingly it has to an observer on our globe
a pyramidal form. Such lenticular distribution of the masses
in the universe is repeated in a remarkable manner in the dispo
sition of the planets and the <U+FB01>xed stars.
    From the great number of cometary masses and asteroids and
the zodiacal light on the one hand, and the existence of a resisting
aether on the other, it necessarily follows that ponderable matter

 must continually be arriving on the solar surface. - The effect
 produced by these masses evidently depends on their <U+FB01>nal velo
 city ; and, in order to determine the latter, we shall discuss some
 of the elements of the theory of gravitation.
    The <U+FB01>nal velocity of a weight attracted by and moving towards
 a celestial body will become greater as the height through which
 the weight falls increases. This velocity, however, if it be only
 produced by the fall, cannot exceed a certain magnitude ; it has
 a maximum, the value of which depends on the volume and mass
 of the attracting celestial body.
    Let r be the radius of a spherical and solid celestial body, and
 g the velocity at the end of the <U+FB01>rst second of aweight falling on the
 surface of this body ; then the greatest velocity which this weight
 can obtain by its fall towards the celestial body, or the velo
 city with which it will arrive at its surface after a fall from an
 in<U+FB01>nite height, is 4/5} in one second.        This number, wherein
 g and r are expressed in metres, we shall call G.
    For our globe the value of g is 98164, . . and that of r
 6,369,800; and consequently on our earth
             G= ~/Z2‘ x 9-8164 >< 6,369,800) =11,1s3.
    The solar radius is 11205 times that of the earth, and the
 velocity produced by gravity on the sun’s surface is 2836 times
 greater than the same velocity on the surface of our globe; the
 greatest velocity therefore which a body could obtain in conse
 quence of the solar attraction, or
            G= t/(2836 >< 112-05) >< 11,1ss=eao,40o;
that is, this maximum velocity is equal to 630,400 metres, or 85
geographical miles in one second.
   By the help of this constant number, which may be called the
characteristic of the solar system, the velocity of a body in cen
tral motion may easily be determined at any point of its orbit.
Let a be the mean distance of the planetary body from the centre
of gravity of the sun, or the greater semidiameter of its orbit
(the radius of the sun being taken as unity); and let lz be the
distance of the same body at any point of its orbit from the
centre of gravity of the sun; then the velocity, expressed in
metres, of the planet at the distance 11 is
                           GX        2a—h_
                            ~ ‘V 2a x I:
At the moment the planet comes in contact with the solar sur
face, it is equal to 1, and its Velocity is therefore,
                           Gx/¢2a-1o

                 Dr. J. R.' Mayer on CelestiZzlDyndm1'c'a.                  ‘B91
 . Itfollows from this formula that the smaller 2a (or the major
 axis of the orbit of a planetary body) becomes, the less will be
 its velocity when it reaches the sun. This velocity, like the
 major axis, has a minimum; for so long as the planet moves
 outside the -sun, its major axis cannot be shorter than the
 diameter of the sun, or, taking the solar radius as a unit, the
 quantity 2a can never be less than 2. The smallest velocity
 with which we can imagine a cosmical body to arrive on the
 surface of the sun is consequently                                              -

 or a velocity of 60 geographical miles in one second. - _ ,                      _
     For this smallest value the orbit of he asteroid is circular;
 for a larger value it_ becomes elliptical, until <U+FB01>nally, with increa
 sing excentricity, when the value of 2a approaches in<U+FB01>nity, the
 orbit becomes a parabola. In this last case the velocity is
                                    '              -

 or 85 geographical miles in’ one second.
     If the value of the major axis become 'negative', or the orbit
 assume the form of a hyperbole, the velocity may increase with
 out end. But this could only happen when cosmical masses
 enter the space of the solar system with a projected velocity, or
 when masses, having missed the sun’s surface, move into the
 universe and never return; hence a velocity greater than G can
 only be regarded as a rare exception, and we shall therefore only
 consider velocities comprised within the limits of 60 and 80
 miles*.
     The <U+FB01>nal velocity with which a weight moving in a straight
 line towards the centre of the sun arrives at the solar surface is
 expressed by the formula
                              c=G>< \/h          1
                                               h    J
wherein a expresses the <U+FB01>nal velocity in metres, and h the original
distance from the centre of the sun in terms of solar radius. If
this formula be comparedwith the foregoing, it will be seen that
a mass which, after moving in central motion, arrives at the sun’s
surface has the same velocity as it would possess had it fallen per
pendicularly into the sun from a distance1- equal to the major
   * The relative velocity also with which an asteroid reaches the solar surface
depends in some degree on the velocity of the sun’s rotation. This, how-\
ever, as well as the rotatory effect of the asteroid, is without moment, and
may be neglected.
   1' This distance is to be counted from the centre of the sun.

axis of its orbit ; whence it is apparent that a planet, on arriving
at the sun, moves at least as quickly as a weight which falls freely
towards the sun from a distance as great as the solar radius, or
96,000 geographical miles.
   What thermal effect corresponds to such velocities? Is the
effect sui<U+FB01>ciently great to play an important part in the immense
development of heat on the sun?
   This crucial question may be easily answered by help of the
preceding considerations. According to the formula given at
the end of Chapter IL, the degree of heat generated by percus
sion 18
                           = 0000] 39° X cg,
where c denotes the velocity of the striking body expressed in
metres. The velocity of an asteroid when it strikes the sun
measures from 445,750 to 630,400 metres; the calori<U+FB01>c effect
of the percussion is consequently equal to from 27% to 55 millions
of degrees of heat*.
   An asteroid, therefore, by its fall into the sun developes from
4600 to 9200 times as much heat as would be generated by the
combustion of an equal mass of coal.
           V. The Origin of the Sun’s Heat (continuation).
   The question why the planets move in curved orbits, one of
the grandest of problems, was solved by Newton in consequence,
it is believed, of his re<U+FB02>ecting on the fall of an apple. This story
is not improbable, for we are on the right track for the discovery
of truth when once we clearly recognize that between great and
smalluo qualitative but only a quantitative difference exists--when
we resist the suggestions of an ever active imagination, and look
for the same laws in the greatest as well as in the smallest pro
cesses of nature.
   This universal range is the essence of a law of nature, and the
touchstone of the correctness of human theories. l/Ve observe
the fall of an apple, and investigate the law which governs this
phenomenon; for the earth we substitute the sun, and for the
apple a planet, and thus possess ourselves of the key to the me
chanics of the heavens.
   As the same laws prevail in the greater as well as in the
smaller processes of nature, Newton's method may be used in
solving the problem of the origin of the sun’s heat. We know
the connexion between the space through which a body falls, the
velocity, the vis viva, and the generation of heat on the surface
   [* Throughout this memoir the degrees of heat are expressed in the
Centigrade scale. Unless stated to the contrary, the measures of length
are given in geographical miles. A geographical mile = 7420 metres, and

 of this globe; if we again substitute for the earth the sun, with
 a mass 350,000 greater, and for a height of a few metres celes
 tial distances, we obtain a generation of heat exceeding all ter
restrial measures. And since we have su<U+FB01>icient reason to assume
 the actual existence of such mechanical processes in the heavens,
 we <U+FB01>nd therein the only tenable explanation of the origin of the
heat of the sun.
    The fact that the development of heat by mechanical means
on the surface of our globe is, as a rule, not so great, and can
 not be so great as the generation of the same agent by chemical
means, as by combustion, follows from the laws already discussed ;
and this fact cannot be used as an argument against the assump
tion of a greater development of heat by a greater expenditure
 of mechanical work. It has been shown that the heat generated
by a weight falling from a height of 367 metres is only Eol<U+FB01>th
part of the heat produced by the combustion of the same weight
of coal ; just as small is the amount of heat developed by a weight
moving with the not inconsiderable velocity of 85 metres in one
second. But, according to the laws of mechanics, the effect is
proportional to the square of the velocity; if therefore the weight
move 100 times faster, or with a velocity of 8500 metres in one
second, it will produce a greater effect than the combustion of an
equal quantity of coal.
    It is true that so great a velocity cannot be obtained by human
means ; everyday experience, however, shows the development of
high degrees of tempe_rature by mechanical processes.
    In the common <U+FB02>int and steel, the particles of steel which are
struck off are su<U+FB02><U+FB01>ciently heated to burn in air. A few blows
directed by a skilful blacksmith with a sledge-hammer against a
piece of cold metal may raise the temperature of the metal at the
points of collision to redness.
    The new crank of a steamer, whilst being polished by friction,
becomes red-hot, several buckets of water being required to cool
it down to its ordinary temperature.
    When a railway train passes with even less than its ordinary
velocity along a very sharp curve of the line, sparks are ob
served in consequence of the friction against the rails.
    One of the grandest constructions for the production of motion
by human art is the channel in which the wood was allowed to
glide down from the steep and lofty sides of Mount Pilatus
into the plain below. This wooden channel, which was built
about thirty years ago by the engineer Rupp, was 9 English miles
in length ; the largest trees were shot down it from the top to the
bottom of the mountain in about two minutes and a half. The
momentum possessed by the trees on their escaping at their
journey’s end from the channel was su<U+FB01>iciently great to bury
                     ‘Z

39§           D1‘; J. R. Mayer on Celestial ‘Dynamics.-J
their thicker ends in the ground to the depth of from 6'to 8'
metres. To prevent the wood getting too hot and taking <U+FB01>re,
water was conducted in many places into the channel.
 - This stupendous mechanical process, when compared with
cosmical processes on the sun, appears in<U+FB01>nitely small. In the
latter case it is the mass of the sun which attracts, and in
lieu of the height of Mount Pilatus we have distances of a
hundred thousand and more miles; the amount of heat gene
rated by cosmical falls is therefore at least 9n1illion times greater
 than in our terrestrial example.
     Rays of heat on passing through glass and other transparent
 bodies undergo partial absorption, which differs in degree, how
 ever, according to the temperature of the source from which the
 heat is derived. Heat radiated from sources less warm than
 boiling water is almost completely stopped by thin plates of
 glass. As the temperature of a source of heat increases, its
 rays pass more copiously through diathermic bodies. A plate of
 glass, for example, weakens the rays of a red-hot substance, even
 when the latter is placed very close to it, much more than it does
 those emanating at a much greater distance from a white-hot
 body. If the quality of the sun’s rays be examined in this
 respect, their diathermic energy is found to be far superior to
 that of all arti<U+FB01>cial sources of heat. The temperature of the
 focus of a concave metallic re<U+FB02>ector in which the sun’s light has
 been collected is only diminished from one-seventh to one-eighth
 by the interposition of a screen of glass. If the same experi
 ment be made with an arti<U+FB01>cial and luminous source of heat, it
 is found that, though the focus be very hot when the screen is
 away, the interposition of the latter-cuts of nearly all the heat ;_
 moreover, the focus will not recover its former temperature when
 re<U+FB02>ector and screen are placed sui<U+FB01>ciently near to the source of
 heat to make the focus appear brighter than it did in the former
 position without the glass screen.
   - The empirical law, that the diathermic energy of heat increases
 with the temperature of the source from which the heat is radi
 ated, teaches us that the sun’s surface must be much hotter than
 the most powerful process of combustion could render it.
     Other methods furnish the same conclusion. If we imagine
 the sun to be surrounded by a hollow sphere, it is clear that the
 inner surface of this sphere must receive all the heat radiated
 from the sun. At the distance of our globe from the sun, such
  a sphere would have a radius 215 times as great, and an area
  46,000 times as large as the sun himself; those luminous and
  calori<U+FB01>c rays, therefore, which meet this spherical surface at

              Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.             395
right angles retain only ‘Growth part of their original intensity.
If it be further considered that our atmosphere absorbs a part of
 the solar rays, it is clear that the rays which reach the tropics of
our earth at noonday can only possess from Bofoooth to <U+FB01>g<U+FB01>th of
the power with which they started. These rays, when gathered
from a surface of from 5 to 6 square metres, and concentrated
 in an area of one square centimetre, would produce about the
 temperature which exists on the sun, a temperature more than
 su<U+FB01>icient to vaporize platinum, rhodium, and similar metals.
    The radiation calculated in Chapter III. likewise proves the
enormous temperature of the solar surface. From the determi
 nation mentioned therein, it follows that each square centimetre
 of the sun’s surface loses by radiation about 80 units of heat per
 minute—-an immense quantity in comparison with terrestrial
radiations.
    A correct theory of the origin of the sun’s heat must explain
 the cause of such enormous temperatures. This explanation can
 be deduced from the foregoing statements. According to Pouillet,
the temperature at which bodies appear intensel white-hot is
about 1500° C. The heat generated by the combustion of one
kilogramme of hydrogen is, as determined by Dulong, 34,500,
and according to the more recent experiments of Grassi, 34,666
units of heat. One part of hydrogen combines with eight parts
of oxygen to form water; hence one kilogramme of these two
gases mixed in this ratio would produce 3850°.
   Let us now compare this heat with the amount of the same
agent generated by the fall of an asteroid into the sun. Without
taking into account the low speci<U+FB01>c heat of such masses when
compared with that of water, we <U+FB01>nd the heat developed by the
asteroid to be from 7000 to 14,000 times greater than that of
the oxyhydrogen mixture. From data like these, the extraordi
nary diathermic energy of the sun’s rays, the immense radiation
from his surface, and the high temperature in the focus of the‘
re<U+FB02>ector are easily accounted for.
   The facts above mentioned show that, unless we assume on
the sun the existence of matter with unheard of chemical pro
perties as a dens ex machind, no chemical process could maintain
the present high radiation of the sun ; it also follows from the
above results, that the chemical nature of bodies which fall into
the sun does not in the least affect our conclusions; the effect
produced by the most in<U+FB02>ammable substance would not differ by
one-thousandth part from that resulting from the fall of matter
possessing but feeble chemical af<U+FB01>nities. As the brightest arti
<U+FB01>cial light appears dark in comparison with the sun’s light, so
the mechanical processes of the heavens throw into the shade the
most powerful chemical actions.

 396           Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
    The quality of the sun’s rays, as dependent -on his-tempera
 ture, is of the greatest importance to mankind. If the solar heat
 were originated by a chemical process, and amounted near its
 source to a temperature of a few thousand degrees, it would be
 possible for the light to reach us, whilst the greater part of the
 more important calori<U+FB01>c rays would be absorbed by the higher
 strata of our atmosphere and then returned to the universe.
    In consequence of the high temperature of the sun, however,
 our atmosphere is highly diathermic to his rays, so that the latter
reach the surface of our earth and warm it. The comparatively
low temperature of the terrestrial surface is the cause why the
heat cannot easily radiate back through the atmosphere into the
universe.     The atmosphere acts, therefore, like an envelope,
which is easily pierced by the solar rays, but which offers consi
derable resistance to the radiant heat escaping from our earth;
its action resembles that of a valve which allows liquid to pass
freely in one, but stops the <U+FB02>ow in the opposite direction.
   The action of the atmosphere is of the greatest importance as
regards climate and meteorological processes. ‘It must raise the
mean temperature of the earth’s surface. After the setting of
the sun—in fact, in all places where his rays do not reach the
surface, the temperature of the earth would soon be as low as
that of the universe, if the atmosphere were removed, or if it did
not exist. Even the powerful solar rays in the tropics would be
unable to preserve water in its liquid state.
   Between the great cold which would reign at all times and in
all places, and the moderate warmth which in reality exists on
our globe, intermediate temperatures may be imagined; and it
is easily seen that the mean temperature would decrease if the
atmosphere were to become more and more rare. Such a rare
faction of a valve-like acting atmosphere actually takes place as
we ascend higher and higher above the level of the sea, and it is
accordingly and necessarily accompanied by a corresponding di
minution of temperature.
   This well-known fact of the lower mean temperature of places
of greater altitude has led to the strangest hypotheses. The
sun’s rays were not supposed to contain all the conditions for
warming a body, but to set in motion the “substance” of heat
contained in the earth. This “substance” of heat, cold when
at rest, was attracted by the earth, and was therefore found in
greater abundance near the centre of the globe. This view, it
was thought, explained why the warming power of the sun was
so much weaker at the top of a mountain than at the bottom,
and why, in spite of his immense radiation, he retained his full
powers.
   This belief, which especially prevails amongst imperfectly in

                Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.               397?
 formed people, and which will scarcely succumb to correct views,
 is directly contradicted by the excellent experiments made by
 Pouillet at different altitudes with the pyrheliometer. These
 experiments show that, everything else being equal, the genera
 tion of heat by the solar rays is more powerful in higher altitudes
than near the surface of our globe, and that consequently a por
tion of these rays is absorbed on their passage through the atmo
sphere. VVhy, in spite of this partial absorption, the mean tem
perature of low altitudes is nevertheless higher than it is in
more elevated positions, is explained by the fact that the atmo
sphere stops to a far greater degree the calori<U+FB01>c rays emanating
from the earth than it does those from the sun.
                 VI. The Constancy of the Sun’s Mass.
    Newton, as is well known, considered light to be the emission
of luminous particles from the sun. In the continued emission
 of light this great philosopher saw a cause tending to diminish the
solar mass; and he assumed, in order to make good this loss, _
comets and other cosmical masses to be continually falling into
the central body.
    If we express this view of Newton’s in the language of the
undulatory theory, which is now universally accepted, we obtain
the results developed in the preceding pages. It is true that our
theory does not accept a peculiar “ substance ” of light or of heat ;
nevertheless, according to it, the radiation of light and heat con
sists also in purely material processes, in a sort of motion, in the
vibrations of ponderable resisting substances. Quiescence is
darkness and death; motion is light and life.
    An undulating motion proceeding from a point or a plane
and excited in an unlimited medium, cannot be imagined apart
from another simultaneous motion, a translation of the particles
themselves* ; it therefore follows, not only from the emission,
but also from the undulatory theory, that radiation continually
 diminishes the mass of the sun. Why, nevertheless, the mass of
the sun does not really diminish has already been stated.
    The radiation of the sun is a centrifugal action equivalent to a
centripetal motion.
    The calori<U+FB01>c effect of the centrifugal action of the sun can be
found by direct observation ; it amounts, according to Chap. III.,
in one minute to 12,650 millions of cubic miles of heat, or 5'17
quadrillions of units of heat. In Chapter IV. it has been shown
that one kilogramme of the mass of an asteroid originates from
27'5 to 55 millions of units of heat; the quantity of cosmical
   " This centrifugal motion is perhaps the cause of the repulsion of the
tails on comets when in the neighbourhood of the sun, as observed by
Bessel

393‘          Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynainics.‘
masses, therefore, which falls every minute into the sun amounts
to from 94,000 to 188,000 billions of kilogrammes.
   To obtain this remarkable result, we made use of a method
which is common in physical inquiries. Observation of the
moon’s motion reveals to us the external form of the earth. The
physicist determines with the torsion-balance the weight of a
planet, just as a merchant <U+FB01>nds the weight of a parcel of goods,
whilst the pendulum has become a magic power in the hands of
the geologist, enabling him to discover cavities in the bowels of
the earth. Our case is similar to these. By observation and
calculation of. the velocity of sound in our atmosphere, we obtain
the ratio of the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air under constant pressure ‘and
under constant volume, and by the help of this number we de
termine the quantity of heat generated by mechanical work.
The heat which arrives from the sun in a given time on a small
surface of our globe serves as a basis for the calculation of the
whole radiating effect of the sun ; and the result of a series of
observations and well-founded conclusions is the quantitative de
termination of those cosmical masses which the sun receives from
the space through which he sends forth his rays.
   Measured by terrestrial standards, the ascertained number of
so many billions of kilogrammes per minute appears incredible.
This quantity, however, may be brought nearer to our compre
hension by comparison with other cosmical magnitudes. The
nearest celestial body to us (the moon) has a mass of about
90,000 trillions of kilogrammes, and it would therefore cover the
expenditure of the sun for from one to two years. The mass of
the earth would afford nourishment to the sun for a period of
from 60 to 120 years.
   To facilitate the appreciation of the masses and the distances
occurring in the planetary system, Herschel draws the following
picture. Let the sun be represented by a globe 1 metre in dia
meter. The nearest planet (Mercury) will be about as large as
a pepper-corn, 3% millimetres in thickness, at a distance of 40
metres. 78 and 107 metres distant from the sun will move
Venus and the Earth, each 9 millimetres in diameter, or a little
larger than a pea. Not much more than a quarter of a metre
from the Earth will be the Moon, the size of a mustard seed, 2%
millimetres in diameter. Mars, at a distance of 160 metres, will
have about half the diameter of the Earth ; and the smaller planets
(Vesta, Hebe, Astrea, Juno, Pallas, Ceres, &c.), at a distance
of from 250 to 300 metres from the sun, will resemble par
ticles of sand.   Jupiter and Saturn, 560 and 1000 metres distant
from the centre, will be represented by oranges, 10 and 9 centi
metres in diameter.     Uranus, of the size of a nut 4 centimetres
across, will be 2000 metres ; and Neptune, as large as an apple

               Dr; J. B. Mayer on Celestial D_1/'nan'n'cs.i          399'
6 centimetres in diameter, will be nearly twice as distant, or
about half a geographical mile away from the sun. From Nep
tune to the nearest <U+FB01>xed star will be more than 2000 geogra
        miles. this picture,- it is ‘necessary to imagine
   To complete

divided matter grouped in a diversi<U+FB01>ed manner, moving slowly
and gradually towards the large central globe, and on its arrival
attaching itself thereto ; this matter, when favourably illuminated
by the sun, represents itself to us as the zodiacal light.          This
nebulous substance forms also an important part of a creation in
which nothing is b chance, but wherein all is arranged with
Divine foresight an wisdom.
   The surface of the sun measures 115,000 millions of square
miles, or 63'. trillions of square metres; the mass of matter which
in the shape of asteroids falls into the sun every minute is from
94,000 to 188,000 billions of kilogrammes; one square metre of
solar surface, therefore, receives on an average from 15 to 30
grammes of matter per minute.
   To compare this process with a terrestrial phenomenon, a
gentle rain may be considered which sends down in one hour a
layer of water 1 millimetre in thickness (during a thunder-storm
the rainfall is often from ten to <U+FB01>fteen times this quantity) 3 this
amounts on a square metre to 17 grammes per minute.
   The continual bombardment of the sun by these cosmical
masses ought to increase its volume as well as its mass, if centri
fugal* action only existed. The increase of volume could scarcely
be appreciated by man; for if the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of these cos
mical masses be assumed to be the same as that of the sun, the
enlargement of his apparent diameter to the extent of one second,
the smallest appreciable magnitude, would require from 33,000
to 66,000 years.                                        _
   Not quite so inappreciable would be the increase of the mass of
the sun. If this mass, or the weight of the sun, were augmented,
an acceleration of the motion of the planets in their orbits would
be the consequence, whereby their times of revolution round the
central body would be shortened.           The mass of the sun is 2-1
quintillions of kilogrammes ; and the mass of cosmical matter
annually arriving at the sun stands to the above as 1 to from 21
   42 millions. Such an augmentation of the weightiof the sun
ought to shorten the sidereal year from ;,¢,0+,,,,5th to §5j,5l;,,j,th Of
its length, or from <U+FB01>lths to 1;-ths of a second.
   The observations of astronomers do not agree with this con
clusion; we must therefore fall back on the theory mentioned at
                          "' [Centripetal ?——TR.]

 the beginning of this chapter, which assumes that the sun, like
 the ocean, is constantly losing and receiving equal quantities of
 matter. This harmonizes with the supposition that the via viva
 of the universe is a constant quantity.
                  VII. The Spots on the Sun’s Disc.
    The solar disc presents, according to Sir John Herschel, the
 following appearance. “When the sun is observed through a
 powerful telescope provided with coloured glasses in order to
 lessen the heat and brightness which would be hurtful to the
 eyes, large dark spots are often seen surrounded by edges which
 are not quite so dark as the spots themselves, and which are
 called penumbrae. These spots, however, are neither permanent
 nor unchangeable. When observed from day to day, or even from
 hour to hour, their form is seen to change; they expand or con
 tract, and <U+FB01>nally disappear; on other parts of the solar surface
 new spots spring into existence where none could be discovered
 before. When they disappear, the darker part ‘in the middle of
 the spot contracts to a point and vanishes sooner than the edges.
 Sometimes they break up into two or more parts that show all
 the signs of mobility characteristic of a liquid, and the extraor
 dinary commotion which it seems only possible for gaseous mat
ter to possess. The magnitude of their motion is very great.
An arc of 1 second, as seen from our globe, corresponds to 465
English miles on the sun’s disc ; a circle of this diameter, which
measures nearly 220,000 English square miles, is the smallest
 area that can be seen on the solar surface. Spots, however, more
than 45,000 English miles in diameter, and, if we may trust some
statements, of even greater dimensions, have been observed. For
such a spot to disappear in the course of six weeks (and they
rarely last longer), the edges, whilst approaching each other, must
move through a space of more than 1000 miles per diem.
    “ That portion of the solar disc which is free from spots is by
no means uniformly bright. Over it are scattered small dark spots
or pores, which are found by careful observation to be in a state
of continual change. The slow sinking of some chemical preci
pitates in a transparent liquid, when viewed from the upper sur
face and in a direction perpendicular thereto, resembles more
accurately than any other phenomenon the changes which the
pores undergo. The similarity is so striking, in fact, that one
can scarcely resist the idea that the appearances above described
are owing to a luminous medium moving about in a non-lumi
nous atmosphere, either like the clouds in our air, or in wide
spread planes and <U+FB02>ame-like columns, or in rays like the aurora
borealis.
   “ Near large spots, or extensive groups of them, large spaces are

              Dr. J. R. Mayer an Celestial Dynamics.           40!
observed to be covered with peculiarly marked lines much brighter
than the other parts of the surface; these lines are curved, or
deviate in branches, and are called faculae. Spots are often seen
between these lines, or to originate there. These are in all proba
bility the crests of immense waves in the luminous regions of the
solar atmosphere, and bear witness to violent action in their
immediate neighbourhood.”                                          '
   The changes on the solar surface evidently point to the action
of some external disturbing force ; for every moving power resi
dent in the sun itself ought to exhaust itself by its own action.
These changes, therefore, are no unimportant con<U+FB01>rmation of the
theory explained in these pages.
   At the same time it must be observed that our knowledge of
physical heliography is, from the nature of the subject, very
limited; even the meteorological processes and other pheno
mena of our own planet are still in many respects enigmatic-al.
For this reason no special information could be given about the
manner in which the solar surface is affected by cosmical masses.
However, I may be allowed to mention some probable conjectures
which offer themslvcs.
   The extraordinarily high temperature which exists on the sun
almost precludes the possibility of its surface being solid; it
doubtless consists of , an uninterrupted ocean of <U+FB01>ery <U+FB02>uid
matter. This gaseous envelope becomes more rare<U+FB01>ed in those
parts most distant from the sun’s centre.
   As most substances are able to assume the gaseous state of
aggregation at high temperatures, the height of the sun’s atmo
sphere cannot be inconsiderable. There are, however, sound
reasons for believing that the relative height of the solar atmo
sphere is not very great.
   Since gravity is 28 times greater on the sun’s surface than
it is on our earth, a column of air on the former must cause a
pressure 28 times greater than it would on our globe. This
great pressure compresses air as much as atemperature of 8000°
would expand it.
   In a still greater degree than this increased gravity do the
qualities peculiar to gases affect the height of the solar atmo
sphere. In consequence of these properties, the density of our
atmosphere rapidly diminishes as we ascend, and increases as we
descend. Generally speaking, rarefaction increases in a geome
trical progression when the heights are in an arithmetical pro
gression. If we ascend or descend 2%, 5, or 30 miles, we <U+FB01>nd our
atmosphere 10, 100,:or a billion times more rare<U+FB01>ed or more dense.
   This law, although modi<U+FB01>ed by the unequal temperatures of
the different layers of the photosphere, and the unknown che
mical nature of the substances of which it is composed, must

402           Dr, J,» R. Mayer 0n—CelestiaZD_1]n_a'mz'dF.
also hold good in ‘some measure for the sun. As, however, the
mean temperature of the solar atmosphere must considerably
exceed that of our atmosphere, the density of the former will not
vary so rapidly with the height as the latter does. If we assume
this increase and decrease on the sun to be ten times slower than
it is on our earth, it follows that at the heights of 25, 50, and
300 miles a rarefaction of 10, 100, and a billion times respect.
ively would be observed. The solar atmosphere, therefore, does
not attain a height of 400 geographical miles, or it cannot be as
much as froth of the sun’s radius. For if we take the density
of the lowest strata of the sun’s atmosphere to be 1000 times
greater than that of our own near the level of the sea, a density
greater than that of water, and necessarily too high, then at a
height of 400 miles this atmosphere would be 10 billion times
less dense than the earth’s atmosphere; that is to say, to human
comprehension it has ceased to exist.
   This discussion hows that the solar atmosphere, in compa
rison with the body of the sun, has only an insigni<U+FB01>cant height;
at the same time it may be remarked that on the sun’s surface,
in spite of the great heat, such substances as water may possibly
exist in the liquid state under a pressure thousands of times
greater than that of our atmosphere.                               -
   Since gases, when free from any solid particles, emit, even at
very high temperatures, a pale transparent light—the so-called
lumen p/zilosop/zicum-—-it is probable that the intense white light
of the sun has its origin in the denser parts of his surface. If
such be assumed to be the case, the sun’s spots and faculae seem
to be the disturbances of the <U+FB01>ery liquid ocean, caused by most
powerful meteoric processes, for which all necessary materials
are present, and partly to be caused by the direct in<U+FB02>uence
of streams of asteroids. The deeper and less heated parts
of this <U+FB01>ery ocean become thus exposed, and perhaps appear to
us as spots, whereas the elevations form the so-called faeulaz.
   According to the experiments made by Henry, an American
physicist, the rays sent forth from the spots do not produce the
same heating effect as those emitted by the brighter parts.
   We have to mention one more remarkable circumstance. The
spots appear to be con<U+FB01>ned to a zone which extends 30° on each
side of the sun’s equator. The thought naturally suggests
itself that some connexion exists between those solar processes
which produce the spots and faculae, the velocity of rotation of
the sun, and the swarms of asteroids, and to deduce therefrom
the limitation of the spots to the zone mentioned. It still re-.
mains enigmatical by what means nature contrives to bring
about the uniform radiation which pertains alike to -the polar
and equatorial regions of the sun.

                       VIII. The Tidal Wave.
    In almost ever case the forces and motions on the surface
of the earth may he traced back to the rays of the sun.       Some
processes, however, form a remarkable exception.
’ One of these is the tides. Beautiful, and in some respects
exhaustive researches on this phenomenon have been made by
Newton, Laplace, and others.          The tides are caused by the
attraction exercised by the sun and the moon on the moveable
pprtts of the earth’s surface, and by the axial rotation of our
   0 e.
5 The alternate rising and falling of the level of the sea may be
compared to the ascent and descent of a pendulum oscillating
    The the
iunder       influence
          continual    of the earth’s
                     resistance,      attraction.
                                 however  weak it may be, which an
 instrument of this nature (a physical pendulum) suffers, con
 stantly shortens the amplitude of the oscillations which it per
 forms; and if the pendulum be required to continue in uniform
 motion, it must receive a constant supply of vis viva correspond
 ing to the resistance it has to overcome.
    Clocks regulated by a pendulum obtain such a supply, either
 from a raised weight or a bent spring. The power consumed
 in raising the weight or in bending the spring, which power is
 represented by the raised weight or the bent spring, overcomes
 for a time the resistance, and thus secures the uniform motion
 of the pendulum and clock. In doing so, the weight sinks
 down or the spring uncoils, and therefore force must be expended
 in winding the clock up again, or it would stop moving.
    Essentially the same holds good for the tidal wave. The
 moving waters rub against each other, against the shore, and
 against the atmosphere, and thus, meeting constantly with re
 sistance, would soon come to rest if a vis viva did not exist com
 petent to overcome these obstacles. This vis viva is the rotation
 of the earth on its axis, and the diminution and <U+FB01>nal exhaustion
 thereof will be a consequence of such an action.         '
    The tidal wave causes a diminution of the velocity of the rota<
 tion of the earth.
    This important conclusion can be proved in different ways.
    The attraction of the sun and the moon disturbs the equi.-._
 librium of the moveable parts of the earth’s surface, so as to
 move the waters of the sea towards the point or meridian above
 and below which the moon culminates.           If the waters could
 move without resistance, the elevated parts of the tidal wave
 would exactly coincide with the moon’s meridian, and under
 such conditions no consumption of vis viva could take place.
 Inreality, however, the moving waters experience resistance, in

 consequence of which the <U+FB02>ow of the tidal wave is delayed, and
 high water occurs in the open sea on the average about 2%
 hours after the transit of the moon through the meridian of
 the place.
     The waters of the ocean move from west and east towards the
 meridian of the moon,- and the more elevated wave is, for the
 reason above stated, always to the east of the moon’s meridian;
 hence the sea must press and <U+FB02>ow more powerfully from east to
 west than from west to east. The ebb and <U+FB02>ow of the tidal
 wave therefore consists not only in an alternate rising and falling
 of the waters, but also in a slow progressive motion from east
 to west. The tidal wave produces a general westerly current in
 the ocean.                                                           ‘
    This current is opposite in direction to the earth’s rotation,
 and therefore its friction against and collision with the bed
 and shores of the ocean must offer everywhere resistance to the
 axial rotation of the earth, and diminish the vis viva of its
 motion. The earth here plays the part of a <U+FB02>y-wheel. The»
 moveable parts of its surface adhere, so to speak, to the rela
 tively <U+FB01>xed moon, and are dragged in a direction opposite to
 that of the earth’s rotation, in consequence of which, action
 takes place between the solid and liquid parts of this <U+FB02>y-wheel,
 resistance is overcome, and the given rotatory e<U+FB02>"ect diminished.
    VVater-mills have been turned by the action of the tides; the
 effects produced by such an arrangement are distinguished in a
remarkable manner from those of a. mill turned by a mountain
 stream. The one obtains the vis viva with which it works from
 the earth’s rotation, the other from the sun’s radiation.
    Various causes combine to incessantly maintain, partly in an
undulatory, partly in a progressive motion, the waters of the
ocean. Besides the in<U+FB02>uence of the sun and the moon on
the rotating earth, mention must be made of the in<U+FB02>uence of
the movement of the lower strata of the atmosphere on the sur
face of the ocean, and of the different temperatures of the sea
in various climates; the con<U+FB01>guration of the shores and the bed.
of the ocean likewise exercise a manifold in<U+FB02>uence on the ve
locity, direction, and extent of the oceanic currents.              -
    The motions in our atmosphere, as well as those of the
ocean, presuppose the existence and consumption of vis viva
to overcome the continual resistances, and to prevent a state of
rest or equilibrium. Generally speaking, the power necessary
for the production of aerial currents may be of threefold origin.
Either the radiation of the sun, the heat derived from a store
in the interior of the earth, or, lastly, the rotatory effect of the
earth may be the source.
    As far as quantity is concerned, the sun is by far the most im

              Dr.v J'. R.‘ Mayer. on Celestial Dynamical        4105
portant of the above. According to Pouillet’s measurements, a
square metre of the earth’s surface receives on the average‘
4408 units of heat from the sun per minute. Since one unit
of heat is equivalent to 367 Km, it follows that one square
metre of the surface of our globe receives per minute an addition
of iris viva equal to 16.20 Km, or the whole of the earthls.
surface in the same time 825,000 billions of Km. A power
of 75 Km per second is called a horse-power. According to
this, the effect of the solar radiation in mechanical work on one
square metre of the earth’s surface would be equal to 0'36, and
the total effect for the whole globe 180 billions of horse-powers.
A not inconsiderable portion of this enormous quantity ofvis viva
is consumed in the production of atmospheric actions, in con
sequence of which numerous motions are set up in the earth’s
atmosphere.                                                        .:
 ' In spite of their great variety, the atmospheric currents may
be reduced to a single type. In consequence of the unequal"
heating of the earth in different degrees of latitude, the colder
and heavier air of the polar regions passes in an under current.
towards the equator; whereas the heated air of the tropics:
ascends to the higher parts of the atmosphere, and <U+FB02>ows from
thence towards the poles. In this manner the air of each he--'.
misphere performs a circuitous motion.                               =
   It is known that these currents are essentially modi<U+FB01>ed b »
the motion of the earth on its axis. The polar currents, wit
their smaller rotatory velocity, receive a motion from east to".
west contrary to the earth’s rotation, and the equatorial cur-.
rents one from west to east in advance of the axial rotation of
the earth. The former of these currents, the easterly winds,"
must diminish the rotatory effect of the globe, the latter, the‘
westerly winds, must increase the same power. The <U+FB01>nal"
result of the action of these opposed in<U+FB02>uences is, as regards
the rotation of the earth, according to well-known mechanical’
principles, =0; for these currents. counteract each other, and
therefore cannot exert the least influence on the axial rotation
of the earth. This important conclusion was proved by La-'
place.                                       '      .                W
   The same law holds good for every imaginable action which
is caused either by the radiant heat of the sun, or by the heat
which reaches the surface from the earth’s interior, whether the
action be in the air, in the water, or on the land. The eifect of
every single motion produced by these means on the rotation
of the globe, is exactly compensated by the effect of another
motion in an opposite direction; so that the resultant of all
these motions is, as far as the axial rotation of the globe is con-'
cerned, =0.

    In those actions known as the tides, such compensation,
 however, does not take place; for the pressure or pull by which
 they are produced is always stronger from east to west than
 from west to east. The currents caused by this pull may ebb
 and <U+FB02>ow in different directions, but their motion predominates
 in that which is opposed to the earth’s rotation.
    The velocity of the currents caused by the tide of the atmo
 sphere amounts, according to Laplace’s calculation, to not more
 than 75 millimetres in a second, or nearly a geographical mile
 in twenty-four hours ; it is clear that much more powerful
 effects produced by the sun's heat would hide this action from
 observation.   The in<U+FB02>uence of these air-currents, however, on
 the rotatory effect of the earth is, according to the laws of me
 chanics, exactly the same as it would he were the atmosphere
 undisturbed by the sun’s radiant heat.
    The combined motions of air and water are to be regarded
 from the same point of view. If we imagine the in<U+FB02>uence of
 the sun and that of the interior of our globe not to exist, the
 motion of the air and ocean from east to west is still left as an
 obstacle to the axial rotation of the earth.
    The motion of the waters of the ocean from east to west was
 long ago veri<U+FB01>ed by observation, and it is certain that the tides
 are the most effectual of the causes to which this great westerly
current is to be referred.
    Besides the tidal wave, the lower air-currents moving in the
 same direction, the trade-winds of the tropics especially, may be
 assigned as causes of this general movement of the waters.
 The westerly direction of the latter, however, is not confined to
 the region of easterly winds; it is met with in the region of
perpetual calms, where it possesses a velocity of several miles
a day; it is observed far away from the tropics both north and
south, in regions where westerly winds prevail, near the Cape of
Good Hope, the Straits of Magellan, the arctic regions, &c.
   A third cause for the production of a general motion of
translation of the waters of the ocean is the unequal heating of
the sea in different zones. According to the laws of hydro
statics, the colder water of the higher degrees of latitude is
compelled to <U+FB02>ow towards the equator, and the warmer water of
the tropics towards the poles, in consequence of which, similar
movements are produced in the ocean to those in the atmo
sphere. This is the cause of the cold under current from the
poles to the equator, and of the warm surface-current from the
equator to the poles. The waters of the latter, by virtue of the
greater velocity of rotation at the equator, assume in their
onward progress a direction from west to east. It is a striking
proof of the preponderating in<U+FB02>uence of the tidal wave that, in

              Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.            $07
spite of this, the motion of the ocean is on the whole in an op"
posite direction.
   Theory and experience thus agree in the result that the in
<U+FB02>uence of the moon on the rotating earth causes a motion of
translation from east to west in both atmosphere and ocean.
This motion must continually diminish the rotatory effect of the
earth, for want of an opposite and compensating in<U+FB02>uence.
   The continual pressure of the tidal wave against the axial
rotation of the earth may also be deduced from statical laws.
   The gravitation of the moon affects without exception all
parts of the globe.     Let the earth be divided by the plane of
the meridian in which the moon happens to be into two hemi
spheres, one to the east, the other to the west of this meridian.
It is clear that the moon, by its attraction of the eastern hemi
sphere, tends to retard the motion of the earth, and by its
attraction of the western hemisphere, to accelerate the same
rotation.
    Under certain conditions both these tendencies compensate
each other, and then the action of the moon on the earth's
rotation becomes zero. This happens when both hemispheres
are arranged in a certain manner symmetrically, or when no
parts of the earth can change their relative position ; in the latter
case a sort of symmetry is produced by the rotation.
    The form of the earth deviates from a perfectly symmetrical
sphere on account of the three following causes :—-(1) the <U+FB02>at
tening of the poles, (2) the mountains on the surface, and
 (3) the tidal wave. The <U+FB01>rst two causes do not change the
velocity of the earth’s axial rotation. In order to comprehend
 clearly the effect of the tidal wave, we shall imagine the earth
 to be a perfectly symmetrical sphere uniformly surrounded by
water. The attraction of the sun and the moon disturbs the
equilibrium of this mass, and two <U+FB02>at mountains of water are
 formed; The top of one of these is directed towards the moon,
and the summit of the other is turned away from it. A straight
 line passing through the tops of these two mountains is called
 the major axis of this earth-spheroid.
    In this state the earth may be imagined to be divided into
 three parts—a smaller sphere, and two spherical segments at
 tached to the opposite sides of the latter, and representing the
 elevations of the tidal wave. The attraction of the moon on the
 small central sphere does not change the rotation, and we have
 therefore only to consider the in<U+FB02>uence of this attraction on the
 two tidal elevations.     The upper elevation or mountain, the
 one nearest the moon, is attracted towards the west because its
 mass is principally situated to the east of the moon, and the
 opposite mountain, which is HE the west of the moon, is at
                                2   2

  tifacted towards the east. The upper tidal elevation is not only
  more powerfully attracted because it is nearer to the moon, but
  also because the angle under which it is pulled aside is more
  favourable for lateral de<U+FB02>ection than in the case of the opposite
  protuberance. The pressure from east to west of the upper
  elevation preponderates therefore over the pressure from west to
  east of the opposite mountain; according to calculation, these
  quantities stand to each other nearly as 14 to 13. From the
  relative position of these two tidal protuberances and the moon,
  or the unchangeable position of the major axis of the earth
  spheroid towards the centre of gravity of the moon, a pressure
  results, which preponderates from east to west, and offers an
  obstacle to the earth’s rotation.
     If gravitation were to be compared with magnetic attraction,
 the earth might be considered to be a large magnet, one pole of
 which, being more powerfully attracted, would represent the
 upper, and the other pole the lower tidal elevation. As the
 upper tidal wave tends to move towards the moon, the earth
 would act like a galvanometer, whose needle has been de<U+FB02>ected
 from the magnetic meridian, and which, whilst tending to
 return thereto, exerts a constant lateral pressure.                --
 "~ The foregoing discussion may sut<U+FB01>ce to demonstrate the in
 <U+FB02>uence of the moon on the earth’s rotation. The retarding
 pressure of the tidal wave may quantitatively be determined_ in
 the same manner as that employed in computing the precession
 of the equinoxes and the nutation of the earth’ axis. The
 varied distribution of land and water, the unequal and unknown
 depth of the ocean, and the as yet imperfectly ascertained
 mean difference between the time of the moon’s culmination
 and that of high water in the open sea, enter, however, as
 elements into such a calculation, and render the desired result
an uncertain quantity.                                            ,
    In the mean time this retarding pressure, if imagined to act
 at the equator, cannot be assumed to be less than 1000_millions_
of kilogrammes. In order to start with a de<U+FB01>nite conception,
we may be allowed to use this round number as a basis for the
following calculations.                                             _
    The rotatory velocity of the earth at the equator is 464
metres, and the consumption of mechanical work, therefore,
for the maintenance of the tides 464,000 millions of Km, or 6000
millions of horse-powers per second. The effect of the tides may
                                  1 th of the effect received by the
consequently be estimated at 30,000
earth from the sun.
    The rotatory effect which the earth at present possesses, may
be calculated from its mass, volume, and velocity of rotation:
The volume of the earth is 2,650,686,000 cubic miles, and

                          Geological Society.    _  , _. "      -‘409
 its speci<U+FB01>c gravity, according to Reich, =5"4-4. 'If, for the
 sake of simplicity, we assume the density of the earth to be
 uniform throughout its mass, we obtain from the above pre- '
 mises, and the known velocity of rotation, 25,840 quadrillions
 of kilogrammetres as the rotatory effect of the earth. If, during
 every second in 2500 years, 464,000 millions of Km of this
 effect were consumed by the ebb and flow of the tidal wave, it
 would suffer a diminution of 36,600 trillions of Km, or about
7-°JT00th of its quantity.                                         ,.
    The velocities of rotation of a sphere stand to each other in
 the same ratio as the square roots of the rotatory effects, when
 the volume of the sphere remains constant. From this it
follows that, in the assumed time of 2500 years, the length of a
                        1 th ; or if a day be taken equal to 86,400
day has increased l.,~aUU,U0l)
seconds, it has lengthened Tl<U+FB01>th of a second, if the volume of the
earth has not changed. Whether this supposition be correct or
 not, depends on the temperature of our planet, and will -be
discussed in the next chapter.
    The tides also react on the motion of the moon. The stronger
attraction of the elevation nearest to, and to the east of the
moon, increases with the tangential velocity of our satellite;
the mean distance of the earth and the moon, and the time of
revolution of the latter, are consequently augmented. The
effect. of this action, however, is insigni<U+FB01>cant, and, accordingto
calculation, does not amount to more than a fraction of a second
in the course of centuries.

ON A METHOD OF VARYING THE TENSION OF THE DISCHARGE
    OF AN ELECTRIC BATTERY, AND OF A R.UHMKORFF’S COIL.
     BY M. A. CAZIN.
    '1‘ is known that the elements of a battery may be associated in two
      ways, according to the nature of the effects which it is desired to
produce. l have thought that analogous arrangements might be used
with condensers of stalical electricity. Hitherto the discharge of
Leyden jars has only been used by uniting the armatures of the same
name, so as to increase the quantity. and association in series has
only been used to charge several batteries at once. I am not aware
that any one has observed the properties of the spark obtained in
 discharging the series by its extreme coatings, although the analogy
of a series of condensers with the pile has long been remarked. Thus
the illustrious Biotin his Traité de Physique describes experiments
in which he has measured, by means of a proof plane, the tension on
the different plates of an insulated series; and he points out the in
crease of the tension from the middle to the extremities of the series,
although it cannot be concluded from his observations that the length
of the spark obtained by these means is much larger than with a
single condenser: this is what I have had occasion to observe. _
  ‘ The <U+FB01>rst experiments were made by M. Ruhmkorfi with the aid
 of his powerful induction-coil. He himself arranged everything
with his known ability, and with a disinterestedness which I here
desire to thank publicly. The poles of the coil being connected on
the one hand with the extreme armatures of a series of insulated
Leyden jars, and on the other hand with a discharge as in the ar
rangement adoptcd for a single condenser, the length of the spark’
 which passes between the arms of the discharger increases as
the number of jars increases, while its magnitude, its lustre, and the
report which accompanies it scarcely appear to diminish. Without
condenser the spark of the induced discharge was from 300 to 360

                   Intelligence and‘Miscellaneous Articles.               4111
 millims.; with a. single middle-sized Leyden jar it was about 30
 millims.; with eight like jars arranged in series the discharge at
 tained I80 m-illims.       We then used jars of almost doublesize; with
 a single one the striking distance was about 17 millims., eight gave a.
 spark of 82 millims. The addition of a ninth increased the spark by
 8 millims. In this mode of working, the successive condensers dis
 charged themselves immediately after having been charged. - To
 retain the charge, one of the poles of the coil must be joined to the
 <U+FB01>nal external armature, and the induction spark taken between the
 other pole and the <U+FB01>rst internal armature. The series becomes charged
 very rapidly, and it can be discharged with the ordinary discharger;
 the elongation of the striking distance is observed as in the <U+FB01>rst
 case.
    The same phenomena are reproduced with the ordinary electrical
rnachiue; Ihave repeated the experiment in the laboratory of the
 Lycée at Versailles, and the general result agrees with the prece
 dinl\g/l.. Ruhmkor<U+FB02>’ and myself think that this new' mode of discharging
 condensers may be useful in a great number of cases. With a cer
 tain number of Leyden jars, associated either in battery or in series,
 discharges will _be obtained, suited by the tension and by the quantity
 of electricity expended, for the most varied effect. M. Ruhmkorlf
 has already witnessed the application of this method to the beautiful
 researches of MM. Pliicker and I-littorf. The satisfactory result which
 we obtained by passing the discharge in a.' capillary tube arranged
like theirs, but containing gas at the ordinary pressure, leads us to
hope that the arrangement in series might be useful to them.-

  LVI. On an Induction Coil of great power, and on the efects of
     connecting Plates with the ends of the Secondary Coil. By the
     Rev. N. J. CALLAN, D.D., Professor of Natural Philosophy in
     St. Patric/c’s College, Maynooth *.
 ABOUT three years and a half ago I made an induction coil
         of considerable power. The secondary coil, which was made
 of No. 34 iron wire, consisted of three parts, two of which were
 each about 2% inches, and the third 3 inches long. The entire
 length of the secondary coil was about 8 inches, and the length of
 the secondary wire about 150,000 feet. The mode of insulation
 is nearly the same as that of the coil described in the Philoso
 phical Magazine for May 1859, except that thin sheet gutta
 percha is used for insulating the spirals of one layer from those
 of the adjoining layers. With three cells of the Maynooth
 battery, in each of which the zinc plate was 4 inches square, the
 coil gave sparks about 10 inches long between two pointed wires,
 one connected with each end of the coil. With <U+FB01>ve cells of the
 same size, the sparks were only 10% inches, but were much louder
than the sparks produced by three cells. Within the last four
months I made a new primary coil nearly 3 feet long with a core
about 3 feet 6 inches in length, and improved the insulation
between the secondary coil and the primary, and also the insu
lation of the three parts of the secondary from each other. .
    Since these changes were made, this coil (the negative end
being connected with a plate containing a square foot of sur
face, and the positive end with a pointed wire) gave sparks 7%
inches long with a single 4:-inch cell of the Maynooth battery.
With two 4-inch cells the sparks were 12% inches, and with
three cells of the same size they were 15 inches in length.

414       Prof. Callan on an Induction Coil of great power.
    When the sparks were taken between two pointed wires, they
were only 6 inches with one, and a little more than 13,}; inches
with three 4r-inch cells. Hence, when the negative end is con
nected with a plate a foot square, the sparks are 1% inch longer
with one cell and 13} inch longer with three cells than when each
end of the coil is connected with a pointed wire.
    When the negative end was connected with a circular brass
plate 4'inches in diameter, and the positive with a pointed wire,
the sparks with one cell were 6;} inches, and with three cells they
were 13% inches. Therefore when the negative end is connected
with a plate a foot square, the sparks are 1} inch longer than
when it is connected with a 4-inch circular plate.
    Since I discovered the great increase produced in the length
of the spark by connecting a large plate of any metal with the
negative end of the coil, I made a series of experiments in order
to ascertain the best size of the plate, and the eifects of connectg
ing plates in various ways with the ends of the coil. Some of
the results of these experiments appear to be anomalous, and not
in accordance with the commonly received theory regarding the
distribution of electricity over the surface of bodies, nor with
the rule for determining the height to which a lightning con
ductor should project above the roof of a building to which it is
attached.
    First, with regard to the size of the plate necessary to produce
the longest spark, I have found that a circular metallic plate 7
inches in diameter is sut<U+FB01>ciently large when the spark does not
exceed 10 inches, and that a piece of wood 9 inches square pro
 duces the same effect as the 7-inch plate. I commonly use a
 circular plate of tin about 12% inches in diameter. With this
plate the coil gives a spark an eighth of an inch longer than with
 a plate containing four square feet of surface. In order to get
 the longest spark from a coil, the outer end of the secondary
 coil should be positive, and the inner end negative; the plate
 should be connected with the negative end, and the pointed wire
 with the positive end, and the central part of the plate should
 face the point of the wire. When the plate faces the point, and
 its circumference is opposite the point, the sparks are a little
 shorter than when the point is opposite the middle of the
 P late.
     Secondly, with regard to the e<U+FB01>ects of plates connected with
 the ends of the coil, I have found that the effects of a plate in
 connexion with the negative end differ very much and in various
 ways from those that are produced by a plate connected with the
positive end.
    In mot of my experiments on this subject the greatest length.
 of spark the coil was capable of giving with the three cells em

        Prof. Callan on an Induction Coil of great poiuerli    415
ployed varied from 13% to 15 inches.        When I used a weaker
battery I mention the length of the spark. The plate was about
12% inches, and the point was opposite to the middle of the plate,
except when the contrary is expressed.
   First, when a pointed wire is connected with the positive end
of the coil, a plate connected with the negative end lengthens the
spark considerably ; but when the pointed wire is connected with
the negative end, a plate connected with the positive one shortens
the spark in a greater proportion. Sparks which were 15 inches
long in the <U+FB01>rst arrangement were reduced to less than 11 inches
by the second; they did not pass at all between the positive plate
and negative point until the plate was brought within 8% inches
from the point.
   Secondly, sparks from a positive point to a negative plate never
went to the circumference of the plate, and scarcely ever struck
the plate at a greater distance from the centre than 3 inches.
But sparks between a negative point and positive plate always
went to the circumference until the plate was brought within 2%
or 3 inches from the point : even when I used a rectangular
plate 20 inches broad and 28 inches long, the sparks went to the
edge of the plate.
   Thirdly, the sparks from a positive point to a negative plate
never moved in a straight line, even when the point was less than
an inch from the plate. But when a negative point is brought
within 21; or 3 inches, or even less than an inch from a positive
plate, the sparks pass in a straight line between the point and
the nearest part of the plate.
   Fourthly, the sparks from a positive point to a negative plate
grow weaker and less loud as the point is made to approach the
plate. But when a negative point is brought within two or three
inches from a positive plate, the sparks become as loud as if the
plate were charged, or as if they were produced by a small Ley
den jar whose opposite coatings were connected with the ends of
the coil. With a plate containing four square feet of surface, the
sparks were louder than with the 12-inch plate. A hollow ball
connected with the positive end of the coil also gives very loud
sparks. Hence a plate or ball connected with the positive end
becomes charged, but a plate connected with the negative end
does not.                          ' '
   Fifthly, when a pointed wire nearly ,1; of an inch thick pro
jected 615; inches from the middle of the. 12%-inch circular plate
connected with the negative end of the coil, and nearly at right
angles to the plate, and another plate of the same size was con
nected with the positive end, the sparks passed not between the
point and positive plate, but from the circumference of one 1'-Q
                       ' other,. although
the circumference of the                          2 of
                                      i the distancle  2 the point.

41.6      Prof. Callan on an Induction Coil of great power;
from the plate was less than 4 inches, and the distance between
the circumference of one plate and that of the other was 10 inches.
But when a pointed wire projected more than three-fourths of an
inch from the middle of a plate connected with the positive end
of the coil, and the other plate was connected with the negative
end, the sparks passed from the point to the negative plate, and
never from the circumference of one to that of the other.
    Sixthly, when a pointed wire projected from the negative plate
at about half an inch from its circumference, and 3% inches
from the plate, the sparks passed even then far less frequently
between the point and the opposite circumference of the positive
plate than between the circumference of one and that of the other
plate. But no such effect will take place when the pointed wire
projects from the positive plate.
   When a pointed wire projected 3% inches from the middle of
a wet slate about 9 inches square, or 2% inches from the middle
of a wet piece of wood of the same size, connected with the nega
tive end of the coil, and the 12%-inch plate was connected with
the positive end, the sparks passed between the circumference of
the plate and the edges of the slate or wood, rather than between
the point and plate. When the slate or wood is dry, the sparks
passed from the pointed wire to the positive plate. When the
wood or slate is merely damp but not very wet, the sparks from
the wire frequently ru11 to the edge of the slate or wood and then
pass to the plate. If the wire project from the wood or slate
near the edges, the sparks will pass between the point and posi
tive plate, unless when the pointed wire projects to a small dis
tance from the wood or slate.
   A ball 3 inches in diameter connected with the positive end
shortens the spark as much as a 12-inch plate.
   When a pointed wire is opposite the edge of a plate connected
with the negative end, the spark is longer than between two
points, but shorter than between a positive point and the middle
of a negative plate.
   \Vhen two plates are connected with the ends of the coil and
face each other, the spark is reduced from 15 inches to about 11
inches. When their edges are opposite to each other, the spark
is also shortened.
   I have repeated most of the above-mentioned experiments with
a weak battery which gave sparks '7 or 8 inches long, and obtained
the same results. When the sparks are about 8 inches, the plate
connected with the end plate should not be more than 7 inches
in diameter. When I connected the 12%-inch plate, or a 3-inch
hollow ball, with the positive end (the longest spark being about
8 inches), no spark passed between the plate or ball and a
negative point until the point was brought within about 2

                 ~Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.’            417
  inches from the plate, or until the sparks resembled the dis
  -charges of a small Leyden jar. The sparks never passed between
  the point and circumference of the plate. It was otherwise when
   I used a 7-inch plate. Hence the size of the plate connected
  with the positive end of the coil must depend on the power of
  the coil employed. The pointed wire used in all the experi
  ments was nearly % of an inch thick.
      I have not as yet had time to give a fair trial to the coil with
  a battery of greater power than that of three 4-inch cells. With
  one cell in which the zinc plate was 4 inches by 8, I got sparks
    if inches long when the plate connected with the negative end
. was only 4 inches in diameter. Had I known at the time that
  with a 12-inch plate the spark is 1% inch longer than with a
  4-inch one, the sparks with the single cell 4.-X8 would have
  been 9% inches long. I intend to try the coil as soon as conve
  nient with a battery of twelve 6-inch cells, and six cells 4 inches
  by 8.

                IX. The Heat of the Interior of the Earth.
          ITHOUT doubt there was once a time when our globe
             had not assumed its present magnitude. According to
  this, by aid of this simple assumption, the origin of our planet
  may be reduced to the union of once separated masses.
      To the mechanical combinations of masses of the second order,
  with masses of the second and third order, &c., the same laws
  as those enunciated for the sun apply. The collision of such
  masses must always generate an amount of heat proportional
  to the squares of their velocities, or to their mechanical effect.
      Although we are not in a position to a<U+FB02>irm anything certain
  respecting the primordial conditions under which the con
  stituent parts of the earth existed, it is nevertheless of the
  greatest interest to estimate the quantities of heat generated by
  the collision and combination of these parts by a standard
  based on the simplest assumptions.
      Accordingly we shall consider for the present the earth to
  have been formed by the union of two parts, which obtained
  their relative motions by their mutual attraction only. Let the
  whole mass of the present earth, expressed in kilogrammes,
  be T, and the masses of the two portions T—.z‘ and an‘.           The
  ratio of these two quantities may be imagined to assume various

  418          _Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
  values.    The two extreme cases are, when at is considered in‘
  <U+FB01>nitely small in comparison with T, and when 4/v=T—w==},~ T.
  These form the limits of all imaginable ratios of the parts T-—.z'
  and .z', and will now be more closely examined.
     Terrestrial heights are of course excluded from the following
 .consideration. In the <U+FB01>rst place let .z', in comparison with
  T—w, be in<U+FB01>nitely small. The <U+FB01>nal velocity with which .z' arrives
  on the surface of the large mass, after having passed through
  a great space in a straight line, or after previous central motion
 round it, is, according to the laws developed in relation to the '
  sun in Chapter IV., con<U+FB01>ned within the limits of 7908 and
  11,183 metres. The heat generated by this process may amount
 to from 8685 x .2 to 17,370 x :0 units, according to the value of
 the major axis of the orbit of :0. This heat, however, vanishes
 by its distribution through the greater mass, because a‘ is, ac
 _cording to supposition, in<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison with T.
     The quantity of heat generated increases with .z', and amounts
 in the second case, when .2/:=3,~T, to from 6000 X T to 8685 xT
 units.
    If we assume the earth to possess a very great capacity for
heat, equal in fact to that of its volume of water, which when
 calculated for equal weights=0'184, the above discussion leads
 to the conclusion that the di<U+FB02>'erence of temperature of the
 constituent parts, and of the earth after their union, or, in
 other words, the heat generated by the collision of these parts,
 may range, according to their relative magnitude, from 0° to
32,000°, or even to 47,000° !
    With the number of parts which thus mechanically combine,
 the quantity of heat developed increases. Far greater still
 would have been the generation of heat if the constituent parts
had moved in separate orbits round the sun before their union,
and had accidentally approached and met each other. For va
rious reasons, however, this latter supposition is not very pro
bable.
    Several facts indicate that our earth was once a <U+FB01>ery liquid
mass, which has since cooled gradually, down to a comparatively
inconsiderable depth from the surface, to its present tempera
ture. The <U+FB01>rst proof of this is the form of the earth. “The
form of the earth is its history.” According to the most careful
measurements, the <U+FB02>attening at the poles is exactly such as a liquid
mass rotating on its axis with the velocity of the earth would
possess; from this we may conclude that the earth at the time
it received its rotatory motion was in a liquid state; and, after
much controversy, it may be considered as settled that this
liquid condition was not that of an aqueous solution, but of a
mass melted by a high temperature.

                Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.          419
     The temperature of the crust of the globe likewise furnishes
  proof of the existence of a store of heat in its interior. Many
  exact experiments and measurements show that the temperature
  of the earth increases with the depth to which we penetrate. In
  boring the artesian well at Grenelle, which is 546 metres deep,
  it was observed that the temperature augmented at the rate of
  1° for every 30 metres. The same result was obtained by ob
  servations in the artesian well at Mondorf in Luxembourg:
  this well is 671 metres in depth, and its water 34° warm.
     Thermal springs furnish a striking proof of the high tem
  perature existing in the interior of the earth. Scienti<U+FB01>c men
  are agreed that the aqueous deposits from the atmosphere, rain,
  hail, dew, and snow, are the sole causes of the formation of
  springs. The water obeying the laws of gravity, percolates
  through the earth wherever it can, and reappears at the surface
  in places of a lower ituation. When water sinks to considerable
  depths through vertical crevices in the rocks, it acquires the
  temperature of the surrounding strata, and returns as a thermal
  spring to the surface.
     Such waters are frequently distinguished from the water of
  ordinary springs merely by their possessing a higher tempera
  ture.   If, however, the water in its course meets with mineral
  or organic substances which it can dissolve and retain, it then
  reappears as a mineral spring. Examples of such are met with
  at Aachen, Carlsbad, &c.
     In a far more decided manner than by the high temperature
  of the water of certain springs, the interior heat of our globe is
_ made manifest by those <U+FB01>ery <U+FB02>uid masses which sometimes rise
  from considerable depths. The temperature of the earth’s crust
  increases at the rate of 1° for every 30 metres we descend from
  the surface towards the centre. Although it is incredible that
  this augmentation can continue at the same rate till the centre
  be reached, we may nevertheless assume with certainty that it
   does continue to a considerable depth. Calculation based on
  this assumption shows that at a depth of a few miles a. tem
  perature must exist su<U+FB02>iciently powerful to fuse most substances.
   Such molten masses penetrate the cold crust of the globe in
  many places, and make their appearance as lava.
     A distinguished scienti<U+FB01>c man has lately expressed himself
  on the origin of the interior heat of the earth as follows :—“ No.
  one of course can explain the <U+FB01>nal causes of things. This much,
  however, is clear to every thinking man, that there is just as
  much reaon that a body, like the earth for example, should be
  warm, warmer than ice or human blood, as there is that it
  should be cold or colder than the latter.       A particular cause
  for this absolute heat is as little necessary as a cause for

 420            Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
 motion or rest. Change—-that is to say, transition from one
 state of things to another-—alone requires and admits of expla
 nation.”
     It is evident that this re<U+FB02>ection is not <U+FB01>tted to suppress the
 desire for an explanation of the phenomenon in question. As all
 matter has the tendency to assume the same temperature as
 that possessed by the substances by which it happens to be
 surrounded, and to remain in a quiescent state as soon as equi
 librium has been established, we must conclude that, whenever
 we meet with a body warmer than its neighbours, such body
 must have received at a (relatively speaking) not far distant
 time, a certain degree of heat,—a process which certainly allows
 of, and requires explanation.
    Newton's theory of gravitation, whilst it enables us to de
 termine, from its present form, the earth’s state of aggregation
 in ages past, at the same time points out to us a source of heat
 powerful enough to produce such a state of aggregation, power
ful enough to melt worlds; it teaches us to consider the molten
 state of a planet as the result of the mechanical union of cos
 mical masses, and thus to derive the radiation of the sun and
 the heat in the bowels of the earth from a common origin.
    The rotatory effect of the earth also may be readily explained
 by the collision of its constituent parts; and we must accord
 ingly subtract the ins viva of the axial rotation from the whole
 effect of the collision and mechanical combination, in order to
 obtain the quantity of heat generated. The rotatory effect,
however, is only a small quantity in comparison with the in
terior heat of the earth. It amounts to about 4400 xT kilo
grammetres, T being the weight of the earth in kilogrammes,
 which is equivalent to 12 x T units of heat, if we assume the
density of the earth to be uniform throughout.
    If we imagine the moon in the course of time, either in con
sequence of the action of a resisting medium or from some
other cause, to unite herself with our earth, two principal elfects
are to be discerned.     A result of the collision would be, that the
whole mass of the moon and the cold crust of the earth would
be raised some thousands of degrees in temperature, and con
sequently the surface of the earth would be converted into a
<U+FB01>ery ocean. At the same time the velocity of the earth’s
axial rotation would be somewhat accelerated, and the position
of its axis with regard to the heavens, and to its own surface,
slightly altered. If the earth had been a cold body without
axial rotation, the process of its combining with the moon
would have imparted to it both heat and rotation.
   It is probable that such processes of combination between
di<U+FB01>crent parts of our globe may have repeatedly happened

              Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.            421
before the earth attained its present magnitude, and that luxu
riant vegetation may have at different times been buried under
the <U+FB01>ery débris resulting from the con<U+FB02>ict of these masses.
   As long as the surface of our globe was in an incandescent
state, it must have lost heat at a very rapid rate; gradually this
process became slower; and although it has not yet entirely
ceased, the rate of cooling must have diminished to a compara
tively small magnitude.
   Two phenomena are caused by the cooling of the earth, which,
on account of their common origin, are intimately related. The
decrease of temperature, and consequent contraction of the
earth’s crust, must have caused frequent disturbances and revo
lutions on its surface, accompanied by the ejection of molten
masses and the formation of protuberances ; on the other hand,
according to the laws of mechanics, the velocity of rotation must
have increased with the diminution of the volume of the sphere,
or, in other words, the cooling of the earth must have shortened

tion are closely connected, it is clear that the youth of our planet
must have been distinguished by continual violent transforma
tions of its crust, and a_perceptible acceleration of the velocity
of its axial rotation; whilst in the present time the metamor
phoses of its surface are much slower, and the acceleration of its
axial revolution diminished to a very small amount.
   If we imagine the times when the Alps, the chain of the Andes,
and the Peak of Teneriife were upheaved from the deep, and com
pare with such changes the earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
of historic times, we perceive in these modern transformations
but weak images of the analogous processes of bygone ages.
   Whilst we are surrounded on every side by the monuments
of violent volcanic convulsions, we possess no record of the
velocity of the axial rotation of our planet in antediluvian times.
It is of the greatest importance that we should have an exact
knowledge of a change in this velocity, or in the length of the
day during historic times; The investigation of this subject
by the great Laplace forms a bright monument in the depart
ment of exact science.
   These calculations are essentially conducted in the following
manner :—In the <U+FB01>rst place, the time between two eclipses
of the sun, widely apart from each other, is as accurately
as possible expressed in days, and from this the ratio of the
time of the earth’s rotation to the mean time of the moon’s
revolution detcrmined._ If, now, the observations of ancient

422            Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
astronomers be compared with those of our present time, the
least alteration in the absolute length of a day may be detected
by a change in this ratio, or in a disturbance in the lunar revo
lution. The most perfect agreement of ancient records on the
movements of the moon and the planets, on the eclipses of the
sun, &c., revealed to Laplace the remarkable fact that in the
course.of 25 centuries, the time in which our earth revolves on
its axis has not altered 5-1‘;-6th part of a sexagesimal second ; and
the length of a day therefore maybe considered to have been
constant during historic times.
    This result, as important as it was convenient for astronomy,
was nevertheless of a nature to create some di<U+FB02>iculties for the
physicist. With apparently good reason it was concluded that,
if the velocity of rotation had remained constant, the volume of
the earth could have undergone no change.        The earth completes
one revolution on its axis in 86,400 sidereal seconds ; it conse
quently appears, if this time has not altered during 2500 years
to the extent of gggth of a second, or ,3_00:,,0O0th part of a day,
that during this long space of time the radius of the earth also
cannot have altered more than this fraction of its length. The
earth’s radius measures 6,369,800 metres, and therefore its
length ought not to have diminished more than 15 centimetres
in 25 centuries.
    The diminution in volume, as a result of the cooling-process,
is, however, closely connected with the changes on the earth’s sur
face. When we consider that scarcely a day passes without the
occurrence of an earthquake or shock in one place or another, and
that of the 300 active volcanos some are always in action, it would
appear that such a lively reaction of the interior of the earth
against the crust is incompatible with the constancy of its
volume.
    This apparent discrepancy between Cordier’s theory of the
connexion between the cooling of the earth and the reaction of
the interior on the exterior parts, and Laplace’s calculation
showing the constancy of the length of the day, a calculation
which is undoubtedly correct, has induced most scienti<U+FB01>c men
to abandon Cordier’s theory, and thus to deprive themselves of
any tenable explanation of volcanic activity.
 ‘ The continued cooling of the earth cannot be denied, for it
takes place according to the laws of nature; in this respect the
earth cannot eomport itself ditferently from any other mass,.
however small it be. In spite of the heat which it receives
from the sun, the earth will have a tendency to cool so long as
the temperature of its interior is higher than the mean tem
perature of its surface. Between the tropics the mean tempe
rature produced by the sun is about 28°, and the sun therefore

                Dr'. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.                   423
is as little able to stop the cooling-tendency of the earth as the
moderate warmth of the air can prevent the cooling of a red-hot
ball suspended in a room.
    Many phenomena, for instance the melting of the glaciers
near the bed on which they rest, show the uninterrupted emis
sion of heat from the interior towards the exterior of the earth ;
and the question is, Has the earth in 25 centuries actually lost
no more heat than that which is requisite to shorten a radius of
more than 6 millions of metres only 15 centimetres?
    In answering this question, three points enter into our cal
culation :—(l) the absolute amount of heat lost by the earth in
a certain time, say one day; (2) the earth’s capacity for heat ;
and (3) the coe<U+FB02>icient of expansion of the mass of the earth.
    As none of. these quantities can be determined by direct
measurements, we are obliged to content ourselves with probable
estimates; these estimates will carry the more weight the less
they are formed in favour of some preconceived opinion.
    Considering what is known about the expansion and contrac
tion of solids and liquids by heat and cold, we arrive at the con
clusion that for a diminution of 1° in temperature, the linear
contraction of the earth cannot well be less than mfoooth part, a
number which we all the more readily adopt because it has been
used by Laplace, Arago, and others.
    If we compare the capacity for heat of all solid and liquid
bodies which have been examined, we <U+FB01>nd that, both as regards
volume and weight, the capacity of water is the greatest. Even
the gases come under this rule; hydrogen, however, forms an
exception, it having the greatest capacity for heat of all bodies
when compared with an equal weight of water. In order not
to take the capacity for heat of the mass of the earth too small,
we shall consider it to be equal to that of its volume of
water, which, when calculated for equal weights, amounts to
O'l84*.
   * The capacity for heat, as well as the coefficient of expansion of matter,
as a rule, increases at higher temperatures.    As, however, these two quan
tities act in opposite ways in our calculations, we may be allowed to
dispense with the in<U+FB02>uence which the high temperature of the interior of
the earth must exercise on these numbers. Even if, in consequence of
the high temperature of the interior, the earth’s’ mass could have 3 ca
pacity two or three times as great as that which it has from 0° to 1009, it
is to be considered, on the other hand, that the coe<U+FB02>icieut of expansion,
ii;-0°, only holds good for solids, and is even small for them, whilst in
the case of liquids we have to assume a much greater coe<U+FB01>icient: for
mercury between 0° and l0O°, it is about six times as great. Especially
great is the contraction and expansion of bodies when they change their
state of aggregation; and this should be taken into account when con
sidering the formation of the earth’s crust.

424           Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
   If we accept Laplace’s result, that the length of a day has
remained constant during the last 2500 years, and conclude
that the earth’s radius has not diminished 1-‘; decimetre in con
 sequence of cooling, we are obliged to assume, according to the
premises stated, that the mean temperature of our planet cannot
have decreased 1%-5° in the same period of time.
   The volume of the earth amounts to 2650 millions of cubic
miles. A loss of heat suf<U+FB01>cient to cool this mass         0° would
be equal to the heat given off when the temperature of 6,150,000
cubic miles of water decreases 1°; hence the loss for one day
would be equal to 6'74 cubic miles of heat.
   Fourier has investigated the loss of heat sustained by the
earth. Taking the observation that the temperature of the earth
increases at the rate of 1° for every 30 metres as the basis of his
calculations, this celebrated mathematician <U+FB01>nds the heat which
the globe loses by conduction through its crust in the space of
100 years to be capable of melting a layer of ice 3 metres in
thickness and covering the whole surface of the globe; this
corresponds in one day to 7'7’ cubic miles of heat, and in 2500
yegrs to a decrease of 17 centimetres in the length of the
ra lus.
 ‘ According to this, the cooling of the globe would be su<U+FB02>i
ciently great to require attention when the earth’s velocity of
rotation is considered.
   At the same time it is clear that the method employed by
Fourier can only bring to our knowledge one part of the heat
which is annually lost by the earth ; for simple conduction
through terra <U+FB01>rma is not the only way by which heat escapes
from our globe.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place, we may make mention of the aqueous
deposits of our atmosphere, which, as far as they penetrate our
earth, wash away, so to speak, a portion of the heat, and thus
accelerate the cooling of the globe. The whole quantity of
water which falls from the atmosphere upon the land in one day,
however, cannot be assumed to be much more than half a cubic
mile in volume, hence the cooling effect produced by this water
may be neglected in ou1' calculation. The heat carried off by all
the thermal springs in the world is very small in comparison
with the quantities which we have to consider here.
   Much more important is the effect produced by active vol
canos. As the heat which accompanies the molten matter to
the surface is derived from the store in the interior of the earth,
their action must in<U+FB02>uence considerably the diminution of the
earth’s heat. And we have not only to consider here actual
eruptions which take place in succession »or-simultaneously at
different parts of the earth’s surface, but also volcanos in a

            Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.            425
quiescent state, which continually radiate large quantities of
heat abstracted from the interior of the globe. If we compare
the earth to an animal body, we may regard each volcano as a
place where the epidermis has been torn off, leaving the interior
exposed, and thus opening a door for the escape of heat.
   Of the whole of the heat which passes away through these
numerous outlets, too low an estimate must not be made. To
have some basis for the estimation of this loss, we have to re
collect that in 1783 Skaptar-Jokul, a volcano in Iceland,
emitted su<U+FB01>cient lava in the space of six weeks to cover 60
square miles of country to an average depth of 200 metres, or,
in other words, about 112- cubic mile of lava. The amount of
heat lost by this one eruption of one volcano must, when the
high temperature of the lava is considered, be estimated to be
more than 1000 cubic miles of heat ; and the whole loss resulting
from the action of all the volcanos amounts, therefore, in all
probability, to thousands of cubic miles of heat per annum.
This latter number, when added to Fourier’s result, produces a
sum which evidently does not agree with the assumption that
the volume of our earth has remained unchanged.
   In the investigation of the cooling of our globe, the in<U+FB02>uence
of the water of the ocean has to be taken into account. Fourier’s
calculations are based on the observations of the increase of the
temperature of the crust of our earth, from the surface towards
the centre. But two-thirds of the surface of our globe are
covered with water, and we cannot assume it priori that this
large area loses heat at the same rate as the solid parts; on the
contrary, various circumstances indicate that the cooling of our
globe proceeds more quickly through the waters of the ocean
resting on it than from the solid parts merely in contact with
the atmosphere.
   In the <U+FB01>rst place, we have to remark that the bottom of the
ocean is, generally speaking, nearer to the store of heat in the
interior of the earth than the dry land is, and hence that the
temperature increases most probably in a greater ratio from the
bottom of the sea towards the interior of the globe, than it does
in our observations on the land.      Secondly, we have to con
sider that the whole bottom of the sea is covered by a layer of
ice-cold water, which moves constantly from the poles to the
equator, and which, in its passage over sand-banks, causes, as
Humboldt aptly remarks, the low temperatures which are
generally observed in shallow places. That the water near the
bottom of the sea, on account of its great speci<U+FB01>c heat and its
low temperature, is better <U+FB01>tted than the atmosphere to with
draw the heat from the earth, is a point which requires no
further discussion.

426          Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.
   We have plenty of observations which prove that the earth
suffers a great loss of heat through the waters of the ocean.
Many investigations have demonstrated the existence of a large
expanse of sea, much visited by Whalers, situated between Ice
land, Greenland, Norway, and Spitzbergen, and extending from
lat. 76° to 80° N., and from long. 15° E. to 15° W. of Green
wich, where the temperature was observed to be higher in the
deeper water than near the surface-—an experience which neither
accords with the general rule, nor agrees with the laws of hy
drostatics.   Franklin observed, in lat. 77° N. and long. 12° E.,
that the temperature of the sea near the surface was ——%°, and
at a depth of 700 fathoms +6°. Fisher, in lat. 80° N. and
long. 11° E., noticed that the surface-water had a temperature
of 0°, whilst at a depth of 140 fathoms it stood at +8°.
   As sea-water, unlike pure water, does not possess a point of
greatest density at some distance above the freezing-point, and
as the water in lat. 80° N. is found at some depth to be warmer
than water at the same depth 10° southward, we can only ex
plain this remarkable phenomenon of an increase of temperature
with an increase of depth by the existence of a source of heat
at the bottom of the sea. The heat, ‘however, which is required
to warm the water at the bottom of an expanse of ocean more
than 1000 square miles in extent to a sensible degree, must
amount, according to the lowest estimate, to some cubic miles
of heat a day.
    The same phenomenon has been observed in other parts of the
world, such as the west coast of Australia, the Adriatic, the
Lago Maggiore, &c.      Especial mention should here be made of
an observation by Horner, according to whom the lead, when
hauled up from a depth varying from 80 to 100 fathoms in the
mighty Gulf-stream off the coast of America, used to be hotter
than boiling water.       ‘
    The facts above mentioned, and some others which might be
 added, clearly show that the loss of heat suffered by our globe
 during the last 2500 years is far too great to have been without
sensible effect on the velocity of the earth’s rotation. The
reason why, in spite of this accelerating cause, the length of a
 day has nevertheless remained constant since the most ancient
times, must be attributed to an opposite retarding action.
This consists in the attraction of the sun and moon on the
liquid parts of the earth’s surface, as explained in the last
chapter.
    According to the calculations of the last chapter, the retard
ing pressure of the tides against the earth’s rotation would
cause, during the lapse of 2500 years, a sidereal day to be
lengthened to the extent of ,—‘¢,'rth of a second; as the length of

              Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial Dynamics.         4127
a-‘day, however, has remained constant, the cooling effect of
the earth during the same period of time must have shortened
the day Tlgth of a second. A diminution of the earth’s radius
to the amount of 4% metres in 2500 years, and a daily loss of
200 cubic miles of heat, correspond to this effect. Hence, in
the course of the last 25 centuries, the temperature of the
whole mass of the earth must have decreased 111°.                '
   The not inconsiderable contraction of the earth resulting
from such a loss of heat, agrees with the continual transforma
tions of the earth’s surface by earthquakes and volcanic erup
tions; and we agree with Cordier, the industrious observer of
volcanic processes, in considering these phenomena a necessary
consequence of the continual cooling of an earth which is still
in a molten state in its interior.
   When our earth was in its youth, its velocity of rotation
must have increased to a very sensible degree, on account of
the rapid cooling of its then very hot mass. This accelerating
eause gradually diminished, and as the retarding pressure of
the tidal wave remains nearly constant, the latter must <U+FB01>nally
preponderate, and the velocity of rotation therefore continually
decrease. Between these two states we have a period of equi
librium, a period when the in<U+FB02>uence of the cooling and that of
the tidal pressure counterbalance each other; the whole life of
the earth therefore may be divided into three periods-youth
with increasing, middle age with uniform, and old age with
decreasing velocity of rotation.
    The time during which the two opposed in<U+FB02>uences on the
rotation of the earth are in equilibrium can, strictly speaking,
only be very short, inasmuch as in one moment the cooling,
 and in the next moment the pressure of the tides must prevail.
 In 9; physical sense, however, when measured by human stand
 ards, the in<U+FB02>uence of the cooling, and still more so that of the
 tidal wave, may for ages be considered constant, and there
 must consequently exist a period of many thousand years’ dura
 tion during which these counteracting in<U+FB02>uences will appear to
 be equal. Within this period a sidereal day attains its shortest
 length, and the velocity of the earth’s rotation its maximum-—
 circumstances which, according to mathematical analysis, would
 tend to lengthen the duration of this period of the earth’s ex
 istence.
    The historical times of mankind are, according to Laplace’s
 calculation, to be placed in this period. Whether we are at the
 present moment still near its commencement, its middle, or
 are approaching its conclusion, is a question which cannot be
 solved by our present data, and must be left to future ge
 nerations.

 428          Dr. J. R. Mayer on Celestial D_r/namics.
     The continual cooling of the earth cannot be without an
 influence on the temperature of its surface, and consequently on
 the climate; scienti<U+FB01>c men, led by Button, in fact, have ad
 vanced the supposition that the loss of heat sustained by our
 globe must at some time render it an un<U+FB01>t habitation for organic
 life. Such an apprehension has evidently no foundation, for
 the warmth of- the earth’s surface is even now much more de
 pendent on the rays of the sun than on the heat which reaches
 us from the interior. According to Pouillet’s measurements,
 mentioned in Chapter III., the earth receives 8000 cubic miles
 of heat a day from the sun, whereas the heat which reaches
 the surface from the earth’s interior may be estimated at 200
 cubic miles per diem. The heat therefore obtained from the
latter source every day is but small in comparison to the diurnal
heat received from the sun.
    If we imagine the solar radiation to be constant, and the heat
we receive from the store in the interior of the earth to be cut
off, we should have as a consequence various changes in the
physical constitution of the_surface of our globe. The tempe
rature of hot springs would gradually sink down to the mean tem
perature of the earth’s crust, volcanic eruptions would cease,
earthquakes would no longer be felt, and the temperature of the
water of the ocean would be sensibly altered in many places—
circumstances which would doubtless affect the climate in many
parts of the world. Especially it may be presumed that
Western Europe, with its present favourable climate, would
become colder, and thus perhaps the seat of the power and
culture of our race transferred to the milder parts of North
America.
 - Be this as it may, for thousands of years to come we can pre
dict no diminution of the temperature of the surface of our
globe as a consequence of the cooling of its interior mass; and,
as far as historic records teach, the climates, the temperatures
of thermal springs, and the intensity and frequency of volcanic
eruptions are now the same as they were in the far past.
    It was different in prehistoric times, when for centuries the
earth’s surface was heated by internal <U+FB01>re, when mammoths
lived in the now uninhabitable polar regions, and when the tree
ferns and the tropical shell-<U+FB01>sh whose fossil remains are now
especially preserved in the coal-formation were at home in all
parts of the world.

LIX. On the Commotion of Energy. By P. G. Tan‘, M.A.,
    Professor ofNatural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh.
        MY DEAR. Sm DAVID BREWSTER,
      FEAR I must trouble you with a second letter on the history
        of the “ Conservation of Energy ;” but it shall be as brief
as possible. And, as Professor Tyndall has demanded, though
not from me, proofs of some assertions made in my former letter,
I shall take this opportunity of giving them.
    The conservation of energy as regards ordinary mechanics was
completely stated by Newton, in its differential form, as a corol
lary to his third law of motion, in the remarkable words, “ Si
ceslimeiur agentis actio ea‘ ejus vi et velocitate conjunctim, et simi
liter resistentis reactio wstimetur conjunctim ex ejus partium sin
yularum velocilalibus et viribus resistendi ab earum altritione, co

 . . . . . sibi invicem semper ¢equales.” In an integral form it

430           Prof. Tait on the Conservation ofEnergy.
occurs, completely proved for a single moving particle, in Sect.
 VIII. Prop. XL. of the Principle.
    So that when Davy experimentally showed that “the imme
 diate cause of the phenomenon of heat is motion, and the laws
 of its communication are precisely the same as the law of the
 communication of motion,” the dynamical theory of heat was so
far completed that it required only a quantitative determination
of the mechanical equivalent. The immense additions it received
from Carnot, and subsequently from Clausius, Rankine, Thomson,
&c., are really only the development of the theory ; and much of
them must rest on hypotheses until we know the intimate struc
ture of matter, and the kind of motion to which heat belongs.
    But the general principle of conservation of energy is founded
on the experimental determination of relations of equivalence
between the various forms of energy, and especially between heat
on the one hand, and each of the others in succession. This was
begun by Joule in 1840, and had already produced a vast amount
of important results, before the appearance of Mayer’s <U+FB01>rst paper.
    That paper, about which so much has lately been written, con
tains in its fundamental statements an essentially false analogy
between the falling together of material masses by gravitation
and the condensation of a gas by the external application of me
chanical force. The idea that heat developed by compression is
an equivalent for the work spent (radically fallacious as it is) is
so important a part of Mayer’s theoretical speculations, that he
has repeated it in his ‘Celestial Dynamics’ (184.8), and his
‘ Remarks on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat’ (1851).
    So far from being a step in advance, the method suggested by
Mayer for the deduction of the mechanical equivalent of heat was
a retrograde step, and tended only to introduce confusion.
   Joule saw that experiment, not hypothesis, was required to
arrive at knowledge regarding the heat evolved by compression.
He thus arrived experimentally in 1844 or 1845 at the know
ledge that when air is compressed the heat evolved is very nearly
the true equivalent of the work spent. In later investigations he
veri<U+FB01>ed Thomson’s'deductions from Carnot’s theory as to the
heat evolved by the compression of liquids (mercury and water),
and application of pressure or tension to solids. Thus while, as
a general principle, Mayer’s hypothesis is essentially false and
misleading, and is signally at variance with the trut when ap
plied to liquids, it is, as Joule’s experiments have shown, approxi
mately veri<U+FB01>ed in air and gases. Having obtained this result,
Joule, <U+FB01>nding no such agreement between Mayer's equivalent
and his own as might have been expected, was led to investigate
the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air; and this important datum, without which
Mayer’s method (even supposing it had been founded on correct

            Prof. Tait on the Conservation of Energy.           431
principles) could never have given even an approximation, was
furnished by Joule in 1851 and 1852, by means of his own value
of the mechanical equivalent as determined from the friction of
liquids, and by actual experiments on the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air
made for the purpose of verifying this deduction.
   In the application of energy to organic processes, Joule pre.
ceded Mayer (at all events as far as publication is concerned) by
two years; and in its application to shooting-stars and some
other points of celestial dynamics he had at least one year's
priority.
   Mayer’s later papers are extremely remarkable and excessively
interesting, and certainly deserve high credit; but, as we have
just seen, they are, though greatly superior in development to
the earliest cosmical speculations of Joule, certainly subsequent
to them in publication.
   My remark about Séguin was already virtually made by Joule
in his published letter of August last. He there gives Séguin’s
equivalent as 363 kilogrammetres, and Mayer’s as 365; and
quotes from Séguin the following sentence which embodies the
assumption of Mayer (but without his false analogy) :—“ La
force mécanique qui apparait pendant l’abaissement de tempéra
ture d’un gaz comme de tout autre corps qui se dilate, est la
mesure et la representation de cette diminution de chaleur.” I
am not aware that Prof. Tyndall has pointed out any inaccura
cies in that letter.
   That Joule gave in 1843 the value 772' foot-pounds (or 770,
which, as Prof. Thomson and I remarked in our article in ‘ Good
Words,’ is within about -gh-th of difference) is denied by Prof.
Tyndall. Prof. Tyndall strangely enough quotes all Joule’s
published values for that year with this remarkable exception;
and this is the more strange that in a foot-note to his last
paper he quotes Joule’s very next sentence. In ‘ Good Words’
we distinctly said “the actual method which he [Joule] <U+FB01>rst em
ployed was to force water through small tubes.” The determi
nations which Prof. Tyndall has quoted were made by means of
the magneto-electric machine, and, considering the excessive ex
perimental di<U+FB01>iculties which this process involves, it is wonderful
that they were not much more widely discordant.

7. On the Crystalline Form and the Optical Properties ofMalachite.
                       By Viktor von Lang.
      ALACHITE crystallizes in the oblique system ; but hitherto
        the whole of its completely crystallographic elements were
not capable of being determined, as on the crystals of this mineral
there had only been found the plane 1 l 0, 1 0 O, 0 1 0, 1 O 1,
which do not yield a suf<U+FB01>cient number of independent angular ele
ments for the purpose. But there are in the mineral collection of
the British Museum crystallized specimens from several localities,
on which several other planes besides these occur. The angles
of these new planes could not be determined with great accuracy,
partly because the crystals themselves are very small, partly also
on account of the imperfection of these faces. But as the <U+FB01>nal
results are in tolerably good accordance, and as some of the cry
stals investigated di<U+FB01>'er in their form from those hitherto known,
I will give here the description of them, adding some remarks
on the optical properties of malachite.
   The following planes have been observed (Plate VI. <U+FB01>g. 10) :
 1oo, 010, 110, 101, 102, 103,104, 1 12,124, 134;
and from the measurements the crystallographic elements

                         ac= 91° 30'
were deduced. With them are calculated the angles of the fol

     The combinations observed belong to two types. The crystals
  of the <U+FB01>rst type, as represented in <U+FB01>gs. 1 to 4, are elongated
  parallel to the axis of the prism (1 1 O) ; the planes at their lower
  end, by which they rest on the mass, could not be observed, and
  the crystals appear therefore in the drawings terminated only by
' the very perfect cleavage-plane 1 O 1. The crystals of this group
  are all twinned, the twin face being 1 O O: the two individuals
  penetrate one another sometimes in a very complex manner,
  which may often cause the unevenness of the prism-planes. I
  succeeded several times in splitting out of such a twin crystal a
  form of an apparently prismatic character, such as is represented
   in a section parallel to the plane of symmetry in <U+FB01>g. 5, where the
   perfect cleavage-planes are marked with the letter c. But a slide
   parallel to this section showed in polarized light the true struc
   ture, as the parts marked with the same number become dark at
   the same azimuth between two crossed Nicol prisms. Similar
   penetrations of two twinned crystals are found also on other
   oblique minerals, as for instance in gypsum. Such were also
   lately described by G. vom Bath on crystals of epidote. The
   forms in <U+FB01>gs. 1, 3, 4 were observed on specimens occurring in a
   kind of sandstone from Wallaroo and Burra Burra in South
   Australia. These specimens are either very small crystals of
   malachite of a light green colour, disseminated on chrysocolla,
   or the crystals on them are larger and of a darker colour, and
   occur in the hollows of denser accumulations of crystallized ma
   lachite together with blue carbonate of copper. Fig. 2 gives the
   form of small deep green crystals of malachite from Grimberg
   near Siegen, on limonite.
      Fig. 1.-110, 115, 105, 101.                   The following angles

      * It seems to me more convenient to give in this form the angles be
   tween planes of two twin individuals, putting the plane (or zone-axis) on
   which they are twinned in the middle, than, as has been usual hitherto, to
   write the plane of the second individual with inverted letters.

   After the engravings of Plate VI. were done, I found on a.
specimen of melaconite from Joachimsthal
in Bohemia small crystals of malachite show
ing only the forms 11 O, 1 OO, O 1 O, 1 O 1,
but remarkable for the unusual predomi
nance of the plane 100, as is represented
in the accompanying woodcut. On some of
the crystals the prism planes were not to be
found at all.
  The second type of crystallization was found
on specimens which came from the same
locality in Australia, the malachite coating
the sandstone in a uniform layer. The crystals are shortened in
the direction of the axis of the zone of the prism 1 00; they
adhere to the stone by their posterior part, and seem to occur
sometimes also not twinned like <U+FB01>g. 6, which is a combination
of110.100.010.I34. Ifoundonsuchacrystal

                is4.1io=106 ap. (105 26 ,, )
   But other crystals, as in <U+FB01>g. 7, are twinned, the two individuals
penetrating each other in the same manner as described before.
The prism-planes of the two individuals are very seldom in one
plane, but form reentering angles of from O to 7 degrees. The
crystal <U+FB01>g. 6, a section of which parallel to the plane of sym
metry is given in <U+FB01>g. 8, is a combination of 1 1 0 and I 24, and
yielded the angle
                I 24.15 4=2a<> 22' (23° 46').
   In this group, however, the planes I 2 4, I3 4, I 04 are stri
ated parallel to their mutual intersection, and therefore cannot be
measured with accuracy.
   With regard to the optical properties of malachite I have the

     Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mirwralogical Notes.         435
following remarks to make. A slide parallel to 1 01, which is
easily obtained by cleavage, shows in the polarizing apparatus
one of the optic axes; and it is possible by inclining the slide a
little to get also the second axis into the <U+FB01>eld of view. One
perceives in this way that the plane of the optic axes is parallel
to the plane of symmetry, and that the optical character of the
<U+FB01>rst mean line is negative. As the crystals are also cleavable
parallel to the plane (0 1 0), although not so perfectly, it is pos
sible to obtain a slide parallel to the plane of symmetry. Such
a slide out of a twin crystal gave, with the aid of a polarizing
microscope, for the angle which the axes of greatest elasticity of
the two individuals make with one another, the approximate value
of 47° 40’, which by the notation before introduced may be ex
pressed by the equation
                       n (1 0 O) n=47° 40'.
Hence we <U+FB01>nd
                       n (1 01)=4° 43'.
Let N in <U+FB01>g. 9 represent the normal to the plane (1 01) ; A, B

They are the result of an accidental crystallization occurring after
the expulsion of the mercury from a mass of the gold amalgam
obtained in the ordinary way.
    The crystals, which are tolerably large, had a pyramidal ap
pearance from the want at certain planes of the cube and the
dodecahedron, as is shown in Plate VII. <U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2. Only the
planes which are represented in the <U+FB01>gures were well developed;
no planes could be observed on the posterior side. Several small
planes were found to belong to the two forms (1 1 3) and (1 2 3),
the latter of which has, I believe, not yet been observed on cry
stals of gold. The data for the calculation of the indices of this
form were (fig. 2),—

   9. On some Combinations of Eudialyte. By Viktor von Lang.
    There are in the handbooks of mineralogy only two or three
combinations of eudialyte represented by drawings. I have under
taken therefore to add a few more, the forms of which were ob
servedon c stals from Kangersluardsuk, South Greenland, in the
mineral col ection at the British Museum. In studying these
crystals also three new planes were found, so that the planes now
known on this mineral are
    o(1l 1), a(O1l), b(2ll), r(100), t(211), _1/(611),
             ¢(o11), s(l1 1), h(] 22), z(20i), n(210),
g], h, n being the new planes. Fig. 7, Pl. VII. gives the principal
zones formed by these planes.

         Notices of Aérolites. By Nevil Story Maskelyne.
                              10. Perth.
   A small stone fell on the <U+FB01>eld known as the North Inch at
Perth on May 17, 1830. The only record of its fall that I have
as yet been able to trace is that which accompanied two small
specimens of the aerolite, and is in the handwriting of the late
Dr. Thomson of Glasgow, in whose collection it was preserved.
Mr. Nevill became the owner of the specimens, and presented
one of them to the Museum. He very liberally also let me have
a microscopic section cut from his own specimen.
    The note in Dr. Thomson’s writing is as follows :—“ Part of a
 meteorolite that fell on the North Inch of Perth during a thunder
 storm on the 17th of May, 1830, at half-past 12 o’clock noon.
The mass of which this is a portion was about 7 inches in dia
meter.”
    The section of this little stone exhibits a beautiful structure,
 placing it high in the series of chondritic aérolites. The sphe
 rules in it are rather numerous and pretty distinct, and exhibit
 great variety. The fanned kind of spherule, and some very sharp
 crystals of a mineral with a diagonal cleavage, are set in a small
 amount of a granular ground-mass. The general aspect of the
 stone presents a bluish-grey hue.
    The iron in it is present in small particles very sparingly
 scattered, and also in some amount as <U+FB01>ne microscopic (intro
 crystalline) dust. The particles of meteoric pyrites are in con
 siderable excess over the iron particles, and there are seen here
 and there on a section small isolated spots of rust.
    Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity is =3'494.

    The larger of the two stones which fell near the village of Par
nallee, sixteen miles south of Madura in the Carnatic (lat. 9° 14',
long. 78° 21'), on.February 28, 1857, was preserved in the cen
tral museum at Madras. It weighs 127 lbs., and has been pre
sented to the British Museum by His Excellency Sir William
Denison, K.C.B., Governor of the Madras Presidency.
    The smaller stone, weighing about 37 lbs., was presented by
the Government of Madras to the gentleman to whom we are
indebted for the account of the fall and the preservation of the
specimens, the Rev. H. S. Taylor, an American missionary cler
gyman. He transmitted it to his native country, where it is now
preserved in the museum of the Western Reserve College of
Hudson, Ohio.      This smaller stone has been described in general
terms and <U+FB01>gured by Professor Cassels in Silliman’s Journal for
November 1861, page 401. Hofrath Haidinger* has also noticed
it, and has drawn attention to the beauty of its polished surface.
    The description of the circumstances attending the fall of the
aérolites was forwarded, mainly through the instrumentality of
Mr. Taylor, to the Madras Government, and may be epitomized
as follows. The two stones fell two or three miles apart, the
larger one to the north of the smaller one and a few seconds
before it. How the priority in time of the fall of the larger stone
came to be observed is not recorded; nor is it very easy to see
how it could be established, as neither stone was seen during its
passage through the air.
    Judging from the inclination of the hole made in the ground
by the larger mass, and which measured 2 feet 5 inches in depth
(whether inclusive or exclusive of the huge stone is omitted from
the account), it was estimated that it came from a direction about
10° west of north, and at an angle with the perpendicular of some
15° or 20°.    Mr. Taylor, however, speaks of the small stone, like
the large one, falling “about perpendicularly.” It would be a
curious fact if the smaller stone <U+FB02>ew further than the larger;
but the difference in the resistance offered to their passage
through the atmosphere by their very different forms may explain
this if the statement be correct. The reports were like two claps
of thunder, and were heard as far off as Tuticorin on the Gulf of
Manar, a distance of 40 miles nearly due south. This last fact,
coupled with the idea some of the natives had formed that the
stones had been shot by guns on ships from Tuticorin, or had
been brought by a Brahman by his muntrums from the sea, in
cline me to believe an E. by S. to a W. by N. direction to have
been that of the aérolites rather than the opposite direction, as

supposed by Mr. Taylor. The stones, however, as before ob
served, were not seen in the act of falling ;- the dust only was
seen which their concussion with the earth raised into the air;
and Mr. Taylor’s observations seem to have been made on the
whole with so much intelligence as to give weight to his opinion
on a subject upon which a person on the spot ought to have the
best means of forming a judgment.
   The large stone now preserved in the Britism Museum is cer
tainly one of the most interesting, as it is one of the largest of
existing aérolites.
   Its form, as seen from two opposite points, is represented in
Plate VIII. It is difficult to de<U+FB01>ne the form of so irregularly
shaped a mass. Two nearly opposite sides of it are comparatively
smooth; the remainder is one mass of pit-marks, sharp, deep,
and irregular, and in two or three cases the pit-marks are deep
holes or <U+FB01>ssures penetrating to some depth into the stone. The
crust is of a grey brown, tolerably thick, but on one of the much
pitted sides presenting the aspect of a less thick coating than
is seen elsewhere on the aérolite, and probably indicating a sur
face of disruption-perhaps the one from which the smaller
Parnallee stone may have been broken while the whole aérolitc
was in its transit through the atmosphere.
   The material of the stone takes a good polish, and presents
a beautiful mottled surface. It is in fact a mass of spherules,
and though not so varied as the really marbled and veined stone
of Akbarpiir, or the coarse breccias of Assam, Aigle, &c., it is
not less striking than any of these, from the peculiar character
imparted to its polished surface by its highly spherular structure
and compact nature.
   In the microscope it forms the most beautiful and instructive
 object I have yet seen among the sections of aérolites. Like
Borkut in the number of its spherules, it differs from that sin
gularly pisolitic stone in the compactness with which its sphe
rules are compacted into a solid whole ; indeed it is probably to this
compact solidity of structure that we are indebted for its falling
in so large an unbroken mass.
   The spherules are well de<U+FB01>ned in form, and are cemented
together in a great degree by meteoric iron and by a considerable
amount of meteoric pyrites, each of which, but especially the
pyrites, is often, as it were, moulded round and between the
closely packed spherules. They are mixed, and their interstices
<U+FB01>lled with a dark mineral (Hyalosiderite? or Fayalite ?) in small
amount. - The marvellous variety revealed by the microscope in
the structure and contents of these spherules makes a slide of
the Parnallee stone an aerolitic microcosm in itself. Some are
seen to consist of porphyritic assemblages of crystals held in a

compact homogeneous granular mass ; others exhibit in their
sharpest features either the barred, the fanned, or the mottled
minerals, of which I shall give descriptions in a future article*.
The iron, again, may be seen in every condition as irregularly
shaped grains and particles, or as microscopic dust; or it
may be found entangled in or entangling sponge-like masses
of meteoric pyrites ; while either of these bodies may be seen in
turn penetrating the spherules, or containing a spherule com
pletely enclosed in them. Or, again, we may <U+FB01>nd one of those
curious veins of metal or of meteoric pyrites, or of these asso
ciated with other minerals highly charged with oxide of iron,
which betray a stage in the history of the aérolitic rock subse
quent to that in which the mass had become compacted as we
now see it, a stage during which it underwent a subsequent split
ting along a direction now indicated by the narrow vein that
<U+FB01>lls the <U+FB01>ssure, and which, running through the spherules, has
divided them and “ heaved” them. Such a vein brings evidence
to prove, by the non-continuity of the outlines of the spherules
on either side of it, that there have been stages in the progress
of the slag-like mass from the <U+FB01>rst origin of the spherule--in
perhaps a seething lake of mixed and molten metals on which a
rare oxygenous atmosphere was acting and fermenting out as it
were the more oxidizable elements—to the <U+FB01>nal state of compact
continuity in which the spherules are found agglutinated together
or imbedded in a magma of mineral.
    Parnallee is in these respects more singular, and it presents
also a more beautiful object in the microscope than do even Bor
kut, Mezo-Madaras, Bremeviirde, Tabor, or Seres.

    The aérolite which fell at Durala on February 18, 1815, was
presented, in the state in which it fell, to the East India Com
pany. After remaining in the library of the East India House
till the change of government took place, it was presented in
1861 to the British Museum by the Secretary of State for India
in Council. The following circumstances attending its fall are
taken from the Report of the British Association for 1850.

                                          “ Loodianah, April 5, 1815.
    “ On the 18th of February last some people who were at work
in a <U+FB01>eld about half a mile distant from the village of Dooralla,
were suddenly alarmed by the explosion of what they conceived
to be a large cannon, ‘ the report being louder than that of any
other gun they had ever heard,’ which report was succeeded by
a rushing noise like that of a cannon-ball in its greatest force.
When looking towards the quarter from whence the noise pro
ceeded, they perceived a large black body in the air, apparently
moving directly towards them, which, passing with inconceivable
velocity, buried itself in the earth at the distance of about sixty
paces from the spot where they stood. The Brahmins of the
village hearing of it, proceeded to the spot withtools for digging
        .
 it u“pThey  found the surface broken, and the fresh earth and
 sand thrown about to a considerable distance; and at the depth
 of rather more than 5 feet, in a soil of mingled sand and loam,
 they found the stone which they cannot doubt was what actually
 fell, being altogether unlike anything known in that part of the
 country. The Brahmins conveyed it to the village, covered it
 with wreaths of <U+FB02>owers, and started a subscription for the pur
 pose of raising a small temple over it. It fell on the 18th of
 February about midday, in a <U+FB01>eld near the village of Dooralla,
 which lies about lat. 30° 20', long. 76° 41', within the territory
 belonging to the Pattialah Rajah, 16 or 17 miles from Umballa,
 and 80 from Loodianah. The day was very clear and serene,
  and, as usual at that season of the year, not a cloud was to be
  seen, nor was there in the temperature of the air anything
  to engage their attention; the thermometer therefore may be
  stated at about 68° in the shade. The report was heard in all the
  circumjacent towns and villages to the distance of 20 coss, or 25
  miles from Dooralla. The Rajah, having been led to consider it
  as a messenger of ill-omen, according to my wish gave immediate
  orders for its conveyance to Loodianah, but with positive injunc
  tions that it should not approach his place of residence. It
   weighs rather more than 25 lbs., and is covered with a pellicle,
   thinner than a wafer, of a black sulphurous crust, though it emits
   no smell of sulphur that I can discover.        It is an ill-shapen
   triangle; and from one of the corners a piece has been broken
   of, either in its fall or by the instruments when taking it out of
   the ground. This fracture discloses a view of the interior, in
   which iron pyrites and nickel are distinctly visible. No Hindoo
   ventures to approach it but with closed hands in apparent devo
   tion, so awful a matter is it in their eyes.”
      “This aerolite was brought from India by Lieut.-Colonel

 4-42    Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
 Penington, and presented to the Hon. East India Company,
 who have deposited it in their museum.”                      _
    With the exception of a small portion broken off at what may
 be termed the apex of the aérolite, the entire stone was sent to
 Europe. Its form is rudely pyramidal, of which the edges,
 especially where they culminate at the broken apex, are rounded
 so as to give aconvex character to that part of the mass. Ridges
 and valley-like depressions converge towards the apex, which,
 while they grow deeper and more marked the further they recede
 from it, become mere linear markings or cracks in the crust
 where they traverse the convex surfaces that would culminate
 on the summit. On the base of the aérolite, on the underside,
 namely opposite to the apex, the crust is accumulated in pitch
like prominences ; in other parts it presents a smooth dull aspect,
 and has a dark rich brown colour.    It exhibits <U+FB01>ssures and lines,
 resulting no doubt from contraction as it cooled. It has also
small shining dark points which correspond apparently with
 spherules.
    The structure of the Durala stone is that of a rather loosely
aggregated chondritic aiirolite. The ground-mass is of a pale
 grey hue, exhibiting a whitish granular mineral interspersed
among waxy nodules. Like Nellore, it does not take a polish.
It differs from Nellore in the distribution of the iron, which is
scattered in somewhat larger particles, and less evenly than in
that aérolite. Some of the iron granules are as much as -,-‘,-th
of an inch in diameter.     On the other hand, in no aerolite
that I have seen is this metal diffused in a more minute form of
dust than in Durala. The ground-mass exhibits under the
microscope a larger amount of the granular mineral than Nel
lore; and spherules and nodules, some smooth, some angular in
outline, are distributed through this mass, and most frequently
  resent under the microscope the usual characteristics of the
waxy (probably olivine) spherule. Occasionally, too, we see a
barred structure sometimes fanned out and radiated, or a mine
ral with a mottled aspect and without much colour in polar
ized light, or very de<U+FB01>nite planes of polarization. Other sphe
rules, again, exhibit a number of crystals within them enclosed
in a mass with sometimes a hexagonal outline, but not with an
orientation exhibiting any evident morphological relation to that
outline.
   The individual minerals are very much like those in Nellore;
and a very few crystals of a felspar-like mineral may be also
detected in Durala.             _
   The cut face has two metallic veins running across it. Its

    This <U+FB01>ne mass, which fell at Yatoor, Nellore, lat. 141° 18',
 long. 79° 46', at half-past 4 P.M. on January 23, 1852, was pre
 sented to the Museum by His Excellency Sir William Denison,
 K.C.B., Governor of Madras. The history of its fall is recorded
in the following deposition :—
    “Deposition of Chella Vencataramoodoo, an inhabitant of
Yatoor in the Talook of Toomalatalpoor, dated the 25th of
January, 1852.
    “ Q.—The circumstance of a sound being heard and a ball
falling on the lands of Yatoor Village was communicated by the
village moonsiif. State where you were then, whence and how
the ball fell, and all you know about it.
    “ A.—At about half-past 4 o’clock P.M. the day before yester
day, I and Cherukoor Soobadoo were grazing cattle near the
ChoutaVagoo, south of Yatoor; and just about <U+FB01>ve or six ghadies,
before it was dark, a noise as of the <U+FB01>ring of a musket was <U+FB01>rst
heard, and as we were looking towards the west we heard a 1'um
bling noise for a moment, and espied at the distance of about forty
yards dust rising to the height of a man. We three then went
to the spot, and found a hole made in the ground 2 spans deep
and 2 spans wide, and a white stone in it; and as it was not
possible to take it out, we took a small piece of that stone that
was on the ground a11d informed the circumstance to the village
mooniff, who went to the spot yesterday morning and dug up
the stone. The soil of the place where the ball fell is composed
of clay and soda.
   “ Q.-—You stated that you were at the distance of forty yards
when the ball fell; did you see then any lightning?
   “ A.——I did not observe any lightning; the sound was indeed
an extraordinary one; the sky was clear and calm; the cattle
ceased grazing, and lifting up their heads, ran away in amaze
ment. We were struck with fear and looked all round.
   “This mark of Chella Vencataramoodoo taken before me on
the aforesaid date. (Signed) T. Marcandaloo, Talzsilda1'.”
   The evidence of another witness was to precisely the same
effect.
   The foregoing facts have been quoted by Hofrath Haidinger
from the same source as that from which I have drawn them.
   The weight of the mass as it arrived in the British Museum
was 30 lbs. Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity = 3'63.
   Its form was rudely prismatic, one end and two sides and the
truncated edge of a third coated with crust, the whole of which
is much pitted with hollows. The colour of the crust is a deep
reddish brown (coloured apparently by ferric oxide). It presents
cracks (as if from cooling), and in some parts it has the pitch

  444      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
  like appearance seen when the crust of an aelrolite has become
  accumulated. This is most the case on the end of the meteorite.
  It is thick and of a dull lustre, and there is no evidence of suc
  cessive formation in different parts of it.
      In structure the Nellore aérolite may be described as composed
  of a friable and porous, pale bluish-grey ground-mass, very much
  stained in patches by ferric oxide, and containing many small
  semiopake, occasionally grey, but often greenish black irregu
  larly formed spherules, and also much granular iron distributed
  pretty evenly in medium-sized particles, with a few larger ones
  scattered at greater intervals. Meteoric pyrites is also seen
  associated with the iron to the amount of about one-third its
  bulk, and occasionally also minute particles of a yellow mineral,
  which is probably iron pyrites. There is also a little of a black
  mineral which appears to be chromite. Examined more closely
  by the microscope, the magma of this a'eIrolite is found to be
  formed of distinct crystals and crystalline aggregates of minerals,
  the latter forming often a <U+FB01>ne grey sort of network in which the
  former are set. This aggregated granular but crystalline mineral
  is like one which forms an important feature in Bachmut and
' the aérolites of its class, in which it is seen surrounding and
  entangling as in a. network the other minerals. It owes its grey
  hue sometimes to microscopic particles of iron and often to minute
  <U+FB01>ssures, among which what appear to be hollow bubbles without
  liquid in them are in Nellore occasionally to be discerned.
      The crystals which are suspended in this ground-mass are of
  different kinds. The most frequent is a mineral with but little
  cleavage, and that parallel to the planes of polarization, which
  doubtless consists of olivine. There are also present minerals
  similar in general appearance and characters to the last, but
  exhibiting a greater amount of cleavage, and that in directions
  diagonal to the prismatic outlines of the crystal and oblique to
  the planes of polarization, though the angles vary with the direc
  tion of the section. The directions of the planes of polarization
  in these minerals usually indicate the prismatic system as being
  probably that of this form of mineral. But a few cases occur in
  which a mineral is seen the system of which does not seem to be
  prismatic, as both the symmetry of the crystal (the section of
  which generally affects the form of a rhomboid) and the direc
  tions of the planes of polarization suggest an oblique or anorthic
  form. This latter mineral is possibly a felspar, as its crystal
  generally presents itself in juxtaposition with another similar
   crystal, evidently, from the different directions of its planes of
   polarization, twinned with it. The former mineral will perhaps
   be found to consist of Enstatite, the prismatic magnesian augite
   (if it may so be termed), for our acquaintance with the true cha

  racters of which we are indebted to the re<U+FB01>ned optical inves
  tigations of M. Des Cloiseaux.
     The spherules appear in different aspects under the microscope:
 greenish-brown wax-like nodules with a laminar structure are
 frequent among them, while others exhibit a more decidedly
 crystalline appearance. In section these nodules present the cha
 racters (and the probably prismatic system) of what for the pre
 sent we may call the fanned mineral--grey in tint from an
 in<U+FB01>nitesimal dust of iron and other foreign matter chie<U+FB02>y accu
 mulated between the laminae ; and they seem to pass by differ
 ent stages into a mottled mineral (or minerals) which, from a
 confusedly crystalline structure, acts on polarized light as agate
 does. This mottled form of mineral in particular cases may be
 seen to consist of the fanned or the barred mineral seen in a
 section cut across the <U+FB01>bre, so to say, of the prisms, and pre
 senting therefore a vast number of sections of these in confused
 arrangement. It would be an arduous task, and take a large
 amount of material, to pick out enough of the several varieties
 of these nodules from the bruised fragments of an aérolite to
 furnish a sufficient quantity for a trustworthyfanalysis. But the
 fanned and mottled minerals are among the ver few the
 spherules of which might perhaps be so treated in t is class of
 aerolites. Some of the spherules exhibit a quasi-crystalline
 exterior, and these are generally such as consist of crystals, and
 in Nellore generally of one imperfect individual crystal, usually
 surrounded by a fringe of irregularly disposed an minute cry
 stalline fragments; while in other aérolites (as in Aussnn for
 instance) we <U+FB01>nd such spherules often to contain perhaps four
 or <U+FB01>ve largish and well-de<U+FB01>ned crystals with a number of minutcr
 ones interspersed between them. But the planes of polarization,
 and therefore the orientation, of each crystal seem quite inde
pendent of those of the rest, and the apparent crystalline out
line of the spherules seem seldom in these cases signi<U+FB01>cative of
an internal crystallographic structure.
' The singular observation of the natives, that the Nellore stone
was white when it fell, may be accounted for on the suppo
sition that it has acquired its rusty stains since. This rusty
character, so obvious a feature of the aérolites of Mainz, Char
wallas, and Segowlee, and in a less degree of Nellore among
others, is certainly the result of oxidation since their fall.  The
di<U+FB01>iculty of taking the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of an aérolite illustrates
its porosity. Even the most compact aérolites absorb much
water in that process. In the microscope the stains of ferric
oxide are seen surrounding the larger granules of metallic iron,
curiously distinguishing them from the meteoric pyrites; but

they are con<U+FB01>ned to the <U+FB01>ssures that penetrate the crystalline
magma in which the iron particles are enclosed.
' Thus, of Segowlee the Asiatic Society of Calcutta sent to Lon
don a very small complete stone with a minute fracture at one
end. That fracture seemed bluer than the large <U+FB01>ssured mass of
Segowlce, of which pieces had before come to Europe. I obtained
Dr. Oldham’s assent on behalf of the Society to a section being
made of it; and the result was a surface exactly like in structure
and material to the original Segowlce, presenting the same irre
gular mixture of crystalline granules of all sizes interspersed with
rather large olivine-like crystals ill de<U+FB01>ned in their outline, and
here and there with spherules remarkable for the illustrations
they a<U+FB01>'ord of the fanned and radiated mineral rich in iron span
gles. But, unlike the brown Segowlee stone, it was as free from
the iron-stains which give its brown hue to that aérolite, as are
the curious stones of Klein-Wenden and Erxleben, with their
 thin crystalline spangles of iron <U+FB01>xed in their clear, colourless,
 and transparent crystal setting.

                             14. Dhenayur.
    An aérolite somewhat similar to, but less chondritic than those
 of Dnrala and Nellore fell at a place called on the label Kheragur,
 on March 28, 1860.         This aérolite was presented by Major
 Bouverie, the Governor-General’s agent at Bhurtpiir, to the
 Asiatic Society of Bengal, and is stated in their ‘Proceedings’ for
  1860, p. 212, to have fallen at avillage about 15 miles south of
 that place. There is also in the same volume a notice in a
 letter from R. F. Saunders, Esq., Deputy Commissioner at
 Kangra, in which he describes the Dhurmnala fall, and inci
 dentally states that an aerial meteor or waterspout (l) had taken
 place in the neighbourhood of Bhurtp<U+FB01>r, “where an aerolite is
  said also to have fallen.” There is no place of the name of
 ‘Kheragur to be found on the great Survey Map of India; but
  S.W. of Bhurtpiir, at some 10 or 12 miles. distance, is a village
 called Dhenagur. I have little doubt that the name Kheragur
  is a mistaken reading of this name, the D and the n being
 readily mistaken for K and 7'. There is a Kyreegur in Oude west
  of a little place called Bhurtapiir, but it is not likely to be the
  place, as the Bhurtpiir known all over India is that in the dis
  trict which takes its name from it. Pending a greater certainty
  as to the position reaching me from India, I shall call this
  aérolite Dhenagur, and I hope on a future occasion to give an
  account of the circumstances attending its fall.
     The specimen in the British Museum was the large half of

the fragment preserved in the collection of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal, and was included among the specimens presented
to the Museum by that Society.
    The crust is very black and dull in lustre; it is thick and
somewhat foliated. The portion retained by the Society exhibits
this crust on three of its sides.
    The ground-mass of this aérolite consists of a nearly white
mineral highly charged with spherules of greenish-yellow olivine
(the waxy mineral), in some cases very da.rk in hue, and pre
senting under the microscope the characteristics of that mineral
 as exhibited in other aérolites.
    It is not sufficiently compact to take a polish.      _
    There is less iron apparent than is the case in Nellore, though
 more than in Durala ; and it is in rather large grains.
     The meteorite is somewhat stained by patches of rust round
 the iron granules ; the result, no doubt, of its porous and loosely
 aggregated character.
     There is a good deal of meteoric pyrites, somewhat crystalline
 and generally in association with the iron.
     By re<U+FB02>ected light in the microscope a white opake <U+FB02>occulent
 mineral is seen in some little quantity, rarely clouding the other
 minerals present as it does in Bishopville, Mallaigaum, &c., but
 usually in fragments and small nodules (as in Borkut, Seres, and
  some other aérolites) intermixed with the other materials of the
  stone.

      The village of Mhow (or Mow) stands on the right bank of
  the Tons, an arm of the Gogra. It is about 37 miles north of
  Ghazeeplir, alld 80 miles south-east of Azimqur, and 57 miles
  south-east of G0ruckp1ir,lat. 25° 54!, long. 33° 37'. Five miles
  from this village, at 3 o’clock in the day, on February 27, 1827,
  an aérolitic shower fell from a serene sky. The largest stone
  recorded weighed 3 lbs. Fragments were picked up four or <U+FB01>ve
  miles apart, one of which broke a tree, and another wounded a
   man. The fall was accompanied by noises like the roar of ord
  nance.
      The fragment preserved in the collection of the Asiatic Society
   at Calcutta weighed 12% ounces, and for a portion of that speci
   men the National Museum is indebted to the liberality of that
   important Society.
      The specimen exhibited in the Museum weighs 53;} ozs. The
   original specimen, when entire, was of a peculiar form. Rudely
   four-sided and somewhat pyramidal, it presented a curved shape,
   so as to look like a fragment splintered from a shell or a hollow
                                  2H2

  mass. It was coated with crust on all its sides, but its ends
  were not incrusted. The crust was dark brown, in parts black,
  in some places with a foliated appearance. It was rather lustrous,
  but not approaching in brilliancy to the enamelled coating of the
  eulcritic varieties of aerolitcs. Its thickness was equal over the
  whole surface, and was considerable. Here and there darker and
  more lustrous spots were seen, and on the convex and concave
  sides there were shallow pittings.
     Under the microscope, in texture and material the Mhow
  aerolite resembles very closely the aerolite of Bachmut, and
  approaches it in speci<U+FB01>c gravity—that of Bachmut being 3'596,
  while that of Mhow is 3'521.
     The structure of this meteorite is that of a tolerably compact
 bluish-grey mass containing spherules disseminated sparsely
 through it, very variable in size, and but little more compact
 than the magma that contains them. The larger iron particles
 are generally surrounded by stains of ferric oxide. The mottled
 bluish-grey colour seems due to the admixture of a white or pale
 brownish-yellow with an iron-grey mineral.
     The iron in it is rather abundant, partly as largish irregular
 granules, partly as small particles, and also as an in<U+FB01>nitesimally
 minute dust disseminated especially through the iron-grey
 mineral.
     Meteoric pyrites is present in the proportion of perhaps one
 fourth or one-<U+FB01>fth of the bulk of the iron.
    A black mineral (chromite?) is also present in some quantity
 in parts of the aerolite, as also several others.
    A microscopic inspection of the materials forming the Mhow
stone exhibits in it a good deal of a granular mineral, forming a
magma in which the spherules and many distinct crystals are set.
This magma is a congeries of (probably for the most part olivi
nous) granules aggregated into a mass which is not at all com
pact, and is similar to the ground-mass of Bachmut and the
aérolites analogous to it, but of rather larger grain than is the
case in Bachmut. In the spherules, which are by no means a -
marked feature of this aérolite, we <U+FB01>nd the grey mineral which
I have before described as occurring in prisms and sometimes
with a fanned or radiated structure. There are also large sphe
rules consisting of a mottled mineral, and containing iron in small
<U+FB02>akes dispersed as if spurted through it.
    Besides these there is a substance in very clear, little, colourless
crystals possessing a diagonal cleavage, and apparently belonging
to the prismatic system. These form groups that, with some of the
granular mineral intervening, build up spherules; but they are
sometimes isolated and outside the spherules. In the latter
state some transparent crystals are also to be seen with a pale

      ' Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.         44-9
   <U+FB02>esh-tint like the olivine in Lherzolite when seen by transmitted
   light.
       It seems not to be dichroic,- it has a cleavage parallel to a
   plane of polarization, and is probably olivine.
                               16. Moradabad.
       An aérolite fell in the densely peopled district of Moradabad
   (in Rohilcund) in the year 1808. The precise date and the cir
   cumstances attending its fall do not seem to be known; but a
   small portion was preserved at Calcutta in the Asiatic Society’s
   Museum, and the British Museum owes to the liberality of that
   Society the fragments it possesses.
       Its place in a classi<U+FB01>cation of aérolites would be near Chateau
   Renard and Bachmut. Coarser-grained in the granular ground
   mass than the latter of these stones, and therefore much more
   so than the former, it exhibits fewer isolated crystals than
   Bachmut, and in this respect is nearer to Chateau-Renard.
       The chondritic character of the stone is barely asserted by a
   very few grey spherules, of which about two may be seen on a
   section of half an inch square. The iron is present chiefly in
   very small particles, very little in microscopic dust, and is asso
   ciated with a considerable proportion, perhaps an equal bulk, of
  meteoric pyrites, Rust-stains are seen in small isolated patches
  on the section. The crust is rather thick and beautifully black.
  From the smallness of the fragments it was di<U+FB02>icult to obtain a
  speci<U+FB01>c gravity, even of the imperfect value usually obtainable
  with aerolites. The result it gave was 3'l43.
                              17. Paulograd.
      My friend Mr. Greg, in an article in the Philosophical Maga
  zine for January (Suppl. to vol. xxiv.), has given an account of
- some very interesting fragments of aérolites, for the acquisition
  of which the National Collection is directly or indirectly indebted
  to him. One of these is the stone of Ekatharinoslav. The
  doubt about this stone was <U+FB01>rst raised, I believe, as some other
  doubts regarding specimens in the British Museum have been,
  by gentlemen at Vienna; and Hofrath Haidinger has published
  a notice about the aérolite in question. A specimen of this fall
  does not exist in the Vienna Collection; but the authorities
  there are making efforts to obtain one from Odessa, which I
  trust may be crowned with success. The grounds of the doubt
  thus raised may be stated to be, that the Paulograd stone in
  the British Museum is one of the many stones very similar to
  Bachmut, and that Bachmut is in the same government as
  Paulograd—both being in that of Ekatharinoslav, and distant
  from each other some 60 or 70 miles. These arguments are

450     Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
certainly in favour of the dpriori assumption that the stones are
fragments of the same fall. To these may be added the statement
in the Allan Catalogue, that the fall took place in the year 1825,
whereas the Paulograd fall is well authenticated as having occurred
on May 19, 1826—that at Bachmut having occurred on February
3, 1814.                                                          ’
    Mr. Greg has, however, so effectually disposed of these rather
plausible objections that I will not repeat his arguments. I
content myself with stating the terms in which Mr. Allan
described his acquisition when it was fresh in his collection, and
with making an observation or two of my own. Mr. Allan's
note, in his own handwriting, is :-—
    “ 1828. No. 15. Fragment of a stone weighing about 85 lbs.
fell in 1825 in the government of Ekatharinosloff; the principal
mass is deposited in the Museum at Odessa: given me by Dr.
Dowler ; the texture of this stone is remarkably distinct. Polish
Ukrain.”
    The question arises, Was Dr. Dowler likely to have made a
blunder between the years 1814 and 1826, rather than that the
 1826 should have been mistaken for 1825, a very probable error
in a copyist? He wasphysieian to CountWoronzow, then recently
appointed governor of that part of Russia, and resident at Odessa.
 As the entry is made in 1828, the present must have been given
by Dr. Dowler within two years of the Paulograd fall, which
happened within the jurisdiction of the illustrious Russian in
whose service he was, and which was far more likely to have
 excited Dr. Dowler’s interest than that of 1814.
    The fall of 1814 at Bachmut consisted, I believe, of two
 masses, severally of 40 lbs. and 20 lbs. in weight, the history of
 which i known. This mass of 85 lbs. could hardly be confounded
with either of them.
    Under the microscope, the stone from the Allan Collection
 exhibits all the characters of the sparsely chondritic class of aero
lites, of which Baehmut is an exam le. It closely resembles this
latter stone in the granular materia that forms the ground-mass
of both, though perhaps that of the Paulograd stone is the finer
in texture, while the isolated crystals in both stones are very
similar in character, but the Bachmut stone seems somewhat the
less rich in them.
    Their speci<U+FB01>c gravities (that of Paulograd =3'584, and that
 of Bachmut =3'596) present too small a difference to support
 any argument against their identity. I have no hesitation in
 retaining the name and date of the Paulograd stone as the true
 designation for the Allan aérolite, as I have entire con<U+FB01>dence in
 its edigree ; and I sincerely hope soon to hear that the Vienna
 Qollection has obtained a <U+FB01>ne mass of it from the original at

      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.       451
Odessa, and that their anxiety on behalf of the authenticity of
the specimen in the British Museum is set at rest.
                        18. Pleskowitz Aiirolite.
     Mr. Greg does not con<U+FB01>ne himself in his paper of January
last to his programme, which included only specimens “ with
which he has happened to have had to do at various times.” He
enters also on the discussion of two stones with which he had but
a slight acquaintance. One of these was the stone of Pleskowitz.
     The British Museum has the good fortune to possess a speci
men of this fall. The indefatigable researches of M. Kesselmeyer
have brought to light the fact that specimens of it were preserved
at Prague, as he has also traced the history of a specimen of the
Tabor fall into the collection of Colonel Greville, a collection
that became the property of the British Museum in 1810. But
the original specimens of the Pleskowitz and Libosehitz fall
appear to have disappeared from notice at Prague; and it is dif
<U+FB01>cult at present to ascertain how Heuland, from whom this
specimen was purchased, became possessed of it.                   "_
     That he attached a very high value to it and appreciated its
 true character is evident from the terms in which he describes it
 in the original invoice, and indeed also from the price paid for
 it; these terms are as follows :— ~
     “ Meteoric stone (weight 1% oz.) from Reichstadt, Bohemia;
 fell the 2nd of June, 1823, and is the only specimen seen by
 Mr. Heuland from that locality. It is surrounded by its crust,
 and both surfaces show an unusually compact character; it is
 mixed with brown oxide of iron. £4/’
     Were there any cause to doubt the honesty or the accuracy of
 this description of Mr. Heuland’s, it would probably be founded
 upon the external similarity of the falls of Pleskowitz and Tabor.
     It was on this similarity that Mr. Greg founded his own doubt.
 But in point of fact this comparison con<U+FB01>rms in a twofold manner
 the genuineness of the Pleskowitz specimen: <U+FB01>rst, by the fact
 of their apparent external similarity, and secondly, by the great
  differences the two stones exhibit in their internal structure. I
  am greatly indebted to M. Kesselmeyer for the courtesy with
  which he has communicated‘ to me everything he has as yet
  ascertained in his laborious researches among old writings about
  these aerolites. That gentleman informs me of a passage in
  Dr. John Mayer’s work, Beytrag zur Geschickte der meteorisc/zen
  Steine in Bohmen, Dresden, 1805, wherein Mayer quotes from a
 ‘most scarce treatise (not in the British Museum) by Stepling,
  ale Placid lapiclezi anni 1753, ad Strkow et ejus causis Meditatio,
  Pragae, 1754, in which he describes no less than three stonefalls
  in Bohemia, viz. :--                                       ' - 1

 452      Prof. Maskelyne and Dr. Lang’s Mineralogical Notes.
     in 1.723 on the 22nd of June, at Liboschitz and Pleskowitz ;
     in 1743 ——                  —, likewise at Liboschitz ;
   and 1753 on the 3rd of July, at Plan and Strkow near Tabor;
  and this, says he, is exceedingly wonderful that the stone he
  (Stepling) has preservedfrom the stonefall of 1723 at Liboschitz
  and Pleskowitz is exactly like the stones of 1753 from Tabor!
     Mr. Greg wrote to ask me whether the Pleskowitz stone was
 like that of Tabor, and whether I did not think the two stones
 might be in fact identical. My reply was, that the two were
 externally curiously alike, but that a closer inspection showed
 the more rusty appearance of the surface of Pleskowitz to be ac
 companied by a greener tint in the ground-mass. I have since,
 by order of the Trustees, had both stones cut and polished, and
 microscopic sections made of them. The answer is decisive. The
 two stones are entirely distinct, and present no point of similarity.
 The Pleskowitz belongs rather to the granular than to the more
 emphatically spherular varieties of chondritic stones, of which
 latter Tabor is a characteristic illustration. It contains far less
 iron than the latter aérolite, and the metallic grains are more
 clustered and less evenly distributed than is the case in Tabor.
 In Tabor, the rust-stains are dotted somewhat dendritically over
the whole face of a section; in Pleskowitz they form patches
rather bright in colour, much seen at the outer part of the section,
even where the crust occurs, and far less in amount in the interior,
large parts of the area of which are quite free from them. The
proportion of meteoric pyrites to meteoric iron is rather higher
in the Pleskowitz stone, and it is disseminated in more minute
particles. This stone also contains the microscopic kind of iron
particles in rather greater abundance than Tabor. When I add
that the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of Tabor is 3'693, and that of Pleskowitz
is 3'49] , as determined with much care from specimens in every
respect similar, and that I know as yet, out of <U+FB01>fty of the most
important falls that I have examined in section, not one that is
like Pleskowitz, I think the original accuracy of Heuland’s
description will be allowed to have been vindicated.
                             19. l/Viborg.
    The second of the two stones regarding the authenticity of
which Mr. Greg has raised doubt, though himself not connected
with their history, is that called in my catalogue Lontalux
(Loutolax or Luotalaks).                       -
    I hope soon to obtain a specimen of the true Loutolax for
comparison; but I feel convinced that the stone so named in
our collection cannot be correctly designated. The description
given by Rose of the true Loutolax, which -he places in his

            On-the Theorems relating to “Canonic Roots.”       ‘ 453
 “ Howardite ” class, and the speci<U+FB01>c gravity as recorded by
 other observers (307), areiquite inconsistent with our very highly
 chondritic stone called by this name being a true specimen of the
 Loutolax fall. Its speci<U+FB01>c gravity is 3'671—3'674. Mr. Greg
 imagined it might be a specimen of Timochin erroneously labelled.
 But it di<U+FB02>“ers from that aérolite very widely in the character of
 its spherules, which are singularly round, numerous, and distinct,
 —and also in the rust-stains-—a very good characteristic where
 aiirolites exhibit them, as the mode of distribution of the stain
 depends on the nature of the porosity of the stone and on the
 mode of dissemination of the iron, which are both important and
 constant features.
    The iron in both is very similarly distributed; but the stains
 are more patchy in the Timochin stone, and the spherules are
 not so sharply relieved by their colourless character from the
 rust around them. Their speci<U+FB01>c gravities are also very nearly
 the same, that of Timochin being 3'636.
    I cannot as yet <U+FB01>nd any meteorite quite like the stone in the
 British Museum, though, until I had sections made, I believed
 Barbotan to be so. It is, however, a very di<U+FB01>"erent stone. I
 should make one remark which I do not think is without im
 portance. This stone was obtained from that sound mineralo
 gist and generally accurate observer Heuland. His original
 description of it, preserved in the archives of the Museum, de
 scribed it as a stone that fell at VVib0rg in March 1814 ; whereas
the stone known as Loutolax fell on December 13, 1813. Heu
 land does not mention the name Loutolax. It is not impossible
that aérolitic falls took place in the neighbourhood of Wiborg on
these two several dates ;. but until some further facts are ascer
 tained on the subject, either con<U+FB01>rming or condemnatory of this
hypothesis, I shall place the “Wiborg” stone of the Museum
among the many specimens of problematical aérolitcs.
LXI. Sequel to the Theorems relating to “Canonic Roots” given
   in the last March Number of this Magazine. By J. J. SYL
   VESTER, F.R.S.*
THE theorems kindly communicated from me by Mr. Cayley
         in the March Number of this Magazine were originally
 designed to appear as a note or ezcursus to a memoir in prepa
ration on the extension of Gauss’s method of approximation from
single to multiple integrals by a method which invariably leads
to the construction of a canonizant whose roots are all real. To
establish this reality, recourse may advantageously be had to a
                     * Communicated by the Author.

454          ‘      Prof. Sylvester on the Theorems
theorem of Jacobi, given at the end of his well known memoir
" De Eliminatione Variabilis e duabus zequationibus,” Crelle,
vol. xv. . 101, a very slight inspection of which at once leads to
the furt er and interesting inference that the resultant of the
canonizant of an odd-degreed function of w and unity, and of the
eanonizant of the second differential coe<U+FB02>icient of that function in
respect to w, is an exact power of the catalecticant of the <U+FB01>rst
zlitferential coe<U+FB01>icient of .2: in respect to the same. This is the
essence of the matter communicated by Mr. Cayley ; but subse
quent successive generalizations of the theorem have led me on,
step by tep, to the discovery of a vast general theory of double
determinants, i. e. resultants of bipartite lineo-linear equations,
constituting, I venture to predict, the dawn of a new epoch in the
history of modern algebra and the science of pure tactic.
    I will begin this note upon a note, by reproducing in brief the
<U+FB01>rst of my two demonstrations of the simple theorem in question’K.
Let us write
                        1m               1"” “Q              I

and so on.        And again, let
                                a  b               a   b   c
               7t|=a,   X2= I b    6 ,    7\3=     II  c   d
                                                   c   d   e
 and so on. The theorem in effect to be proved is simply this,
 that the resultant of X; and X,-_, is an exact power of 7t,-, which
 (as will at once be seen) is the coe<U+FB02>icient of .22‘ in X,-. In what
 follows, I shall use R(P, Q) 01.‘ R(Q, P) to denote indifferently
 the positive or negative resultant of any two functions P and Q,
 ignoring for greater simplicity all considerations as to the proper
 algebraical sign to be a<U+FB02>ixed to a resultant of two functions taken
 in an assigned order.
     Jacobi’s theorem above referred to, stated so far as necessary
 for the purpose in hand, is as follows :
                   X,,= (A.z'+l3)Xn_,       X”2 X,,_,.
                                        _ 7",’;-1
 Hence, by virtue of a general theorem of elimination 1',
                                             A?
               R(X.., X,._.)=>;;__,R (- X3" 'X..-., X.._1 ;
                                              -1
    * The second has been communicated by Mr. Cayley in the March
 Number of this Magazine.
    1' This theorem is best seen by dealing in the <U+FB01>rst instance with U, V,
  any two homogeneous functions of av, 31 of degrees 11, n—1 respectively

                       relating to “ Canonic Roots.”                       455
or, neglecting as premised all considerations of algebraical sign,
                                          ("-1)

or if any one of my readers <U+FB01>ndd a di<U+FB02>iculty in admitting that
R(a.22—b, l)=a, he can stop short at Ekxélii, which may
 easily be veri<U+FB01>ed to be equal to unity.             Hence
                      R(X,,, X,,_1) =7\.f‘"“’.      Q. E. D.‘
 Thus we see that if X,,, X,,_, have one root in common, 7\.,, must
 vanish ; but then, by the cited theorem of Jacobi, it follows that
 X,, completely contains X,,_1 ; from this it was easy to infer the
 necessity of the function* of which X, is the canonizant, having
 in<U+FB01>nity for one of its “ canonic roots ”-or, in other words, of its
 being reducible to the form
     lc|(.z'+h1)2""I +k,(a +h,)""‘ + . . . +k,,__,(.z-+h,,__,)"'"" +k,,.
 And so it became natural to establish a priori the existence of
 this condition, and thus to obtain the proof virtually reproduced
 by Mr. Cayley in the article referred to.
     In what precedes, X,,_, was a first prinmpal minor of Xn ; and
 it occurred to me to institute an inquiry into the form of the
 resultant of two functions related to each other as X,,_1 is to X,,,
 with the sole but important difference that the constants in X,
 are not to be contained in a concatenated order from one line to
 another, but to be taken perfectly independent as in the example

   The Resultant of this matrix means the quantity R which,
equated to zero, will indicate the possibility of the simultaneous
nullity of all its <U+FB01>rst minors, so that R will be the factor common
to the resultants of every couple of these minors. If we name

minant obtained by suppressing the uppermost (or .2-) line of the
rectangular matrix C3 . . . C,,..1 C".
   To <U+FB01>nd R, we may proceed in the general case in the manner
indicated in the example following, where n—1 is made 4.
Taking the two extreme <U+FB01>rst minors and dividing them respect
ively by y and a", we have two equations of the following form
for determining R, viz.

the fruits of his meditations to perish (as has been the fate of
too many foregone theories, the still-born progeny of his brain,
now'for ever resolved back again into the primordial matter
of thought), or venturing to produce from time to time such
imperfect sketches as the present, calculated to evoke the mental
cooperation of his readers, in whom the algebraical instinct has
been to some extent developed, rather than to satisfy the strict
demands of rigorously systematic exposition.
    LXII. On the Source and Maintenance of the Sun’s Heat.
         By Professor CHALLIS, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
F-l‘HE most recent speculations to which the question of the
        maintenance of the sun’s heat has given rise are chie<U+FB02>y
these which follow. In a paper contained in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (vol. xxi. part 1. p. 63) and
in the Philosophical Magazine for December 1854, Professor
William Thomson has concluded that “the source of energy
from which solar heat is derived is undoubtedly meteoric.” He
contends that the waste of heat by radiation can be supplied in
no other way than by the heating effect of the impact of small
                    " Communicated by the Author.

 bodies descending in spiral courses to the sun’s surface, and
 supposes that these bodies constitute by their aggregate visibility
 the phenomenon of the zodiacal light. This theory appears,
 however, to have been subsequently abandoned for the most
 part, if we may judge from statements made by Professors
 Thomson and Tait in the article “ On Energy” (in the Number
 of ‘ Good Words ’ for October 1862), which on another account
 is now attracting the attention of men of science. The authors
 there admit that an explanation which “supposes the loss by
 radiation at present not to be compensated by fresh in<U+FB02>ux
 of meteoric matter” is probably the true one. According
to this explanation, the sun “must be at present in the con
 dition of a heated body cooling. But being certainly liquid
for a great depth all round his surface, if not throughout,
the super<U+FB01>cial parts must sink by becoming heavier as they
contract through cooling. The currents thus produced, bring
ingfresh portions from below to the surface, and keeping all the
liquid thoroughly stirred up, must distribute the loss of heat
very equably throughout the whole liquid mass, and so prevent
the surface from cooling quickly, as it certainly would do if the
 super<U+FB01>cial stratum were solid.” This new theory has apparently
not satis<U+FB01>ed Sir John Herschel, who, in an article “ On the Sun ”_
contained in the Number of the same publication for April 1863,
has suggested that the permanence of the sun’s light and heat
might possibly be accounted for by attributing a species of vita
lity to Nasmyth’s ‘ willow-leaves.’
    I will not disguise that I have cited the above views because
in my opinion they give evidence of themselves, without the
necessity of any argument, that the problem of the sun’s heat
has not yet been solved, and justify the course I am about to
take of attempting the solution of it on entirely different prin
ciples. The investigation which I now proceed to enter upon
will rest, <U+FB01>rst, on the hypothetical constitution of matter which
I have already so frequently enunciated, viz. that all visible and
tangible substances consist of discrete inert atoms of spherical
form and constant magnitude; and secondly, on the mathema
tical theory of heat which I have expounded in the Philosophical
Magazine for March 1859. This theory assumes that the force
of heat is due to the dynamical action of the direct vibrations of
the mther, the lawsof the vibrations being inferred by mathe
matical reasoning applied to the medium on hydrodynamical
principles, and on the supposition that it is a continuous and
perfect <U+FB02>uid varying in pressure proportionally to variations of
its density.
    Before applying the above principles to the present problem,
an instance of the dynamical action of aerial vibrations will be

462                Prof. Challis on the Source and
adduced, which will serve to illustrate the subsequent reasoning.
It is a well-known fact that if vibrations are excited at one.end
of a cylindrical tube open at both ends, by blowing across it, or
other means, there will be formed in the tube equidistant posi
 tions of minimum velocity and intermediate positions of minimum
 change of density. These facts are accounted for by supposing
 that two series of vibrations are propagated along the tube in
 opposite directions. If the series are exactly alike and equal, the
 velocity will be zero at the former positions, and at the other
there will be no condensation. In actual instances the vibrations
are not generally exactly equal when they originate in the man
ner above mentioned. But for our present purpose we may
assume them to be so, taking no account of a slight excess of
the vibrations of one set above those of the other. Now the
vibrations propagated from the end where the disturbance is
made are clearly due to the disturbance itself. But what is the
origin of the returning vibrations? The answer to this question
is, that the tube is at the other end relatively a. cause of disturb
ance by suddenly ceasing to con<U+FB01>ne the vibrations as they reach
it. At both ends the condition must he satis<U+FB01>ed that the density
is permanently very nearly the same as in the surrounding air.
At the further end this condition is ful<U+FB01>lled by the relative dis
turbance producing re<U+FB02>ected waves, of which the condensation in
that position is just equal and opposite in sign to the condensa
tion due to the direct waves. At the other end the same con
dition is ful<U+FB01>lled by the condensation due to the re<U+FB02>ected waves
being equal and opposite in sign to that impressed by the dis-_
turbance. Under the circumstances supposed, the motion is
evidently alike on the two sides,of a plane dividing the tube
transversely into two equal parts, and in the position of this
plane the velocity is zero.     Conceive now the column of <U+FB02>uid in
the tube to be divided by an inde<U+FB01>nitely thin partition placed in
that position. That half of the column which is furthest from
the disturbance will then become quiescent, and the vibrations
of the other half will remain just as before. Consequently the
total movement of the <U+FB02>uid will be only half as much in the case
of the closed tube as in that of the open tube, although the ori
ginal disturbance is the same in the two cases.     In fact, there is,
in the latter case, an additional relative disturbance, due to the
rigidity, or constancy of form, of the tube. _We have thus been
conducted to a remarkable principle, peculiar to the motion of a
<U+FB02>uid, viz. that the ‘effect of a disturbance impressed actively may
be subsequently increased by a relative disturbance due to a
passive rigid body. The above considerations are not merely
illustrative of the principle, but amount to a proof that it holds
good in aerial vibrations, and by consequence in aetherial vibra

tions, the aether, according to our hypothesis, being constituted
like air of given temperature. But the mode of its application
is in some respects di<U+FB01>erent, as we shall presently see, in the
theory of the sun’s heat.
   Reverting now to the mathematical theory of heat. above
referred to, it_ is <U+FB01>rst to be noticed that, according to that theory,
the constituent atoms of substances are kept apart bya repulsion
due to the dynamical action of vibrations re<U+FB02>ected from their
spherical surfaces. It is there shown mathematically that such
vibrations propagated in the directions of the produced radii of
an atom, and impinging on a neighbouring atom, may cause a
 permanent motion of translation of the latter, repelling it from
the other. It is not, however, this effect that we are at present
concerned with. We have rather to consider what modi<U+FB01>cations
the impinging undulations are subject to in consequence of the
inertia and constant spherical form of the atom on which they
are incident. ‘We "will suppose that the undulations propagated
from the <U+FB01>rst atom (without at present considering how they
may have originated) are alike in all directions from its centre;
in which case the velocity V and condensation 0' at the time t
and at the distance r from the centre are given by the known
equations,                                                ‘

   Since it may be inferred from exp_erimental_facts that the
radius of an atom must be very small compared to the mean in
terval between adjacent atoms, and also that this mean interval
is very small compared to the values of 7» for waves of light and
heat, the above expressions prove that the <U+FB01>rst term of the value
of V has an extremely small ratio to the other at the surface of
the atom from which the waves radiate, and also a very small

   This being premised, let us now consider the modifications
which the waves de<U+FB01>ned by the above equations undergo on en;
countering the adjacent atom, with especial reference to the
secondary waves which the presence of the atom gives rise to-.

 Respecting the condensation represented by 0', we may at once
 assert that it is neither increased nor diminished by the inci
 dence of the waves on the second atom, on the general principle
 that condensations and rarefactions once generated are never
 destroyed, but are dissipated by propagation into unlimited
 space.    They may be diverted, expanded, and contracted; but
 the total quantity of condensation and‘ rarefactioii remains the
 same.
    Next we have to investigate the effect of the incidence of that
 part of the velocity V which is represented by the second term,
 and is unaccompanied by condensation. Neglecting, for the
 sake of simplicity, the motion of the atom, and supposing the
 velocity of impact at its surface to be W, and the angle of inci
 dence at any point to be 0, the velocity due to the resistance of
 the surface will be W cos 0. Now, although the incident velo
 city was not accompanied by condensation, it is evident that the
 surface of the atom cannot impress this velocity without pro
 ducing pressure, and therefore condensation, since action and
 reaction must be equal.      Consequently there will be, apart from
 the original condensations of the incident waves, new conalensations
 due to the inertia, and constancy ofform, of the atom. This is a
 very important result as regards the theory of the internal heat
 of the sun, or of any other body, on the undulatory hypothesis
 of heat.
    Any vibratory motion which the atom might have, whether
 caused by extraneous waves, or by the dynamic effect of those
'under consideration, would produce condensations by impressing
 the fluid, which would coexist with those due to the atom’s re
 action, but would not alter the above general inference.
    The part of the value of V which is equal to /can‘, regarded
 independently of the accompanying condensation, will operate
 in the same manner as the other part, and will equally give rise
 to new condensations by the reaction of the atom. These, how
 ever, will generally be of much smaller magnitude than the
 others.
    Such secondary undulations at the surface of the second atom
 as those which we found to result, by the reaction of its surface,
 from undulations emanating from the <U+FB01>rst, will also result from
 undulations emanating from all the surrounding atoms. And
 since we may suppose the atoms to be distributed equally in all
 directions from any one of them, the secondary undulations of
 that one will, in the aggregate, be equal at all points of the
 surface, as was assumed to be the case, without assigning a
 reason, at an early stage of this argument. Accordingly we are
led to the conclusion that the undulations which emanate equally
 in all directions from each atom, and constitute by their dynamic
                        --u-_—_—- __         i

                  Maintenance of the Sun’s Heat.                465
action the repulsion of heat, are mainly produced by the reaction
of the atoms, due to their inertia and impenetrability. It is plain,
however, from this reasoning, that there must be an original and
independent source of undulations. Now obviously such a supply
may be conceived to be furnished to the sun by undulations ema
nating from the stars. We have ocular evidence that stars trans
mit light-undulations, and it is quite possible that they originate
others not sensible to the sight. Also, according to our pre
liminary hypothesis respecting the constitution of bodies, the
sun must be regarded as atomically constituted throughout.
Hence the stellar-undulations, of whatever kind, entering his
vast body, have their effects multiplied to an incalculable amount
by the reaction of the immense number of atoms. This is the
theoretical explanation of the sun’s internal heat. The continual
generation of new undulations both maintains the heat, and sup
plies the loss resulting from the continual propagation of undu
lations from the body of the sun. If the external supply be con
stant, the sun’s internal heat must eventually be constant also.
For if at any time the loss of undulations by emanation exceeded
the supply by internal generation, the heat would decline, and
the atoms of the sun being brought closer together by the con
sequent contraction, the generation of undulations would increase
till it became adequate to the supply of the loss. So if at any
time the generation of undulations and the internal heat were in
excess, the supply would be diminished by the expansion of the
mass. Hence the sun’s heat will be constant so long as the calori<U+FB01>c
action of the universe is constant.
   In a previous communication entitled a “ Theory of Molecular
Forces,” contained in the Philosophical Magazine for February
 1860, I have shown how the waves propagated from the indivi
dual atoms of a body constitute by their aggregation compound
waves of di<U+FB02>erent orders, the highest of which is the order of
gravity-undulations. It is under this form of compound undu
lations that the above-mentioned loss by emanation takes place.
    This theory is not complete unless an explanation be given of
the origin of the light-undulations which come from stars. In
asmuch as our sun is a star, the inquiry is the same as that of
ascertaining the origin and generation of the sun’s light. Solar
light is always accompanied by heat—the latter being due to
direct vibrations, and the other to transverse.     But this heat is
to be regarded in its origin and e<U+FB01>'ects as quite distinct from the
internal heat above treated of. Observations of the sun’s disc
seem to indicate that the solar rays which are at once light
bearing and heat-bearing, come chie<U+FB02>y from the upper super<U+FB01>cial
boundary of a stratum of cloudy matter, which, with occasional
interruptions in the form of spots, perpetually surrounds the

466      On the Source and Maintenance of the Sun’s Heat.
body of the sun. The phenomena of the spots show that the
stratum is of great thickness. The movements it undergoes
justify the assumption that it is in composition cloud-like—that is
to say, that it consists of a congeries of very minute masses, as
terrestrial cloud consists of extremely minute globules of water.
Now the <U+FB02>ow of undulations from the sun, spoken of in the
foregoing explanations, must traverse this stratum of molecules;
and though the undulations will pass through the molecules, for
the same reason that they pass through the substance of the sun,
yet in the case of such insulated bodies the passage cannot take
place without some degree of disturbance and the generation of
secondary undulations. These views being understood, the
theory I now propose of the generation of the sun’s sensible
light and heat is, that it is owing to the collision of the second
ary undulations originating in the cloud-stratum with the pri
mary large undulations emanating from the sun’s body. On a
like principle I account for the zodiacal light by the collision
of the same large undulations with steady gyrations about the
sun. -(See the articles on the Zodiacal Light in the Philoso
phical Magazine for February and March 1863.) What seems
to con<U+FB01>rm this explanation is, that the solar light comes princi
pally from the superior boundary of the stratum, up to which
limit the supposed collision must be accumulative, and at this
limit also there is a sudden break of continuity of the disturb
ances. The amount of collision between the primary and the
resulting secondary waves will depend on the number and com
bination of the latter, and will clearly be greatest where the
boundary of the stratum cuts at right angles the directions of
the propagation of the primary waves. According to this view
the slanting surfaces of a depression, constituting the penumbra
of a spot, are less bright than the general surface, because they
are inclined to the directions of the sun’s radii, and on this ac
count the resultants of the secondary waves come less directly
into collision with the primary waves. For the contrary reason,
the faculae, or bright streaks, are due to crests and elevations of
the cloud-matter. On the same principle the general mottled
appearance of the sun’s face is readily explained—the brighter
parts corresponding to the rounded tops of cumuli, and the
shaded parts to their slanting sides.
   In this manner the theory accounts for the sensible light and
heat of the sun; and on the hypothesis that the same operations
are going on in the stars as in the sun, the theory at the same
time accounts for the sensible light and heat, and for the in
ternal heat, of every body of the universe.
   It may be remarked that in giving the above explanations I
have not deviated in the least particular from the physical prin-.

       Historic Notice of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.          467
ciples I have so often asserted in this Magazine, nor from the
views of the ultimate qualities of matter, and the nature of phy
sical forces, which Newton has left on record.        The readiness
with which those principles apply in the solution of the dii<U+FB01>cult
problem of the sun’s heat, may be taken as evidence of their
being founded in truth. If the tendency of the explanations is
to show that all the forces of nature are either active pressures
of the acther, or passive resistances of atoms, I do not see that
this conclusion should not be accepted because it reduces physical
forces to such conceptions as can be perfectly reached by experi
ment and common observation.

   LXIII. Historic Notice of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.
                         By M. VERDE'1‘*.
     HE importance to be attached to this new theory (the dy
        namical theory of heat) makes it a duty on my part to
<U+FB01>nish this exposition by a short historic review, in which I shall
attempt to render justice to the principal discoverers. This is
all the more necessary as I have hitherto constantly followed
the logic of the ideas without any regard to the historic order of
the discoveries.                         -
   Two periods may be distinguished in this history. During one
of these, which extends to the year 1842, ideas similar to that em
bodied in the mechanical theory of heat have been expressed by
various authors, while in some cases the same phenomena that
this theory explains have been regarded in accordance with other
principles, and useful attempts have been made to refer them to
general laws. But the true principle not being found, these
efforts remained isolated, sterile, and without sensible in<U+FB02>uence
on the general progress of science. All this labour, however,
<U+FB01>nished by hearing its fruit, and towards the year 1842 the new
idea, as is often the case with great discoveries, clearly revealed
itself to several minds almost at the same moment. Soon
afterwards began that period of rapid progress which always
follows the discovery of a true principle, and a few years su<U+FB01>iced
to establish the magni<U+FB01>cent assemblage of results which I have
attempted to lay before you.
    The <U+FB01>rst name on the list of those who may be regarded as
the precursors of the mechanical theory of heat is that of the
illustrious Daniel Bernoulli. The ‘ Hydrodynamics ’ of this
great geometer and physicist contained—for a century for
   * Translated from the Expose’ de la Théorie Mécanique de la Chaleur,
p. 109-118.

468        .       M. Verdet’s Historic Notice of
gotten and neglected by all the world——the theory of the consti
tution of gases to which I have referred towards the close of our
<U+FB01>rst meeting. His contemporaries saw probably in this theory
only a portion of the débris of ancient Cartesian hypotheses; and
until quite recently nobody would suppose that in them would
be found the germ of a new science.          -
    In 1780, a little more than forty years after the publication
of the ‘ Hydrodynamics,’ Lavoisier and Laplace, discussing in
their memoir on heat the two hypotheses which could be enter
tained regarding the nature of this agent, express themselves in
the following manner :—
    “Other physicists think that heat is only the result of the
insensible vibrations of matter. . . . In the system which we
are examining heat is the living force which results from the
insensible motions of a body, it is the sum of the products of the
mass of each molecule by the square of__its velocity. . . . VVe
will not decide between the two preceding hypotheses; several
phenomena appear favourable to the latter, such, for example, as
 the heat produced by the friction of two solid bodies; but
 there are others which are more simply explained by the <U+FB01>rst
hypothesis; perhaps both of them occur at the same time.”
    But after this assertion, so clear and so precise, in no part of
the memoir do we meet the idea of comparing the living force of
heat with the ordinary living force which is sensible in the
 motion of a body’s centre of gravity or in the motion of rota
 tion. Never did Lavoisier and Laplace compare heat except
 with itself; and hence it mattered little for the fertility of their
 reasonings, whether they considered heat as an indestructible
body, or as a quantity of living force.
    More than this, in a subsequent part of their work they
 regard as evident a proposition which is directly opposed to the
 principle of the conversion of heat into work. All 1:a1'iaii0ns of
 heat, they say, whether real or apparent, e.I]m'icnccd by a s_1/stem
 of bodies, in changing their state, are produced in the inverse order
 when the system returns to its <U+FB01>rst condition. If they had added
 that this equality occurs only when the changes of condition are
 accompanied by no exterior work, the mechanical theory of heat
 would have been founded; but without this complement the
 assertion of Lavoisier and Laplace is an error, disproved every
 day by the action of a steam-engine or an elcctro-magnetic ma
 chine.
    No one knows the extent to which the views of Lavoisier on
 this subject might have been modi<U+FB01>ed had he lived. ‘It can
 only be presumed, from the reading of his treatise on chemistry,
 that in 1789 he had not entirely abandoned the theory which
 refers heat to molecular motions. It is true that, yielding per

                  the Mechanical Theory of Heat.              469
haps to the in<U+FB02>uence of the current opinions of his time, he
speaks of gases as if they resulted from the combination of cer
tain bases with caloric. But he always showed a reserve, no
trace of which is to be found in the writings of his disciples; it
was not without scruple that he placed light and calorie at the
head of the list of elementary bodies.
~ As to Laplace, his ideas changed very quickly, and in all that
he wrote after the period of his association with Lavoisier
he has shown himself the convinced defender of the theory of
the materiality of caloric. His imposing authority even
produced partisans of that theory long after it had been shown
to be without the least foundation.
    Towards the end of the eighteenth century, in 1798 and 1799,
two experiments were made which were sufficient to demonstrate
the inanity of the theory adopted by the author of the lllécanique
 Céleste. These were the celebrated experiments of Rumford and
Davy on the heat disengaged by friction. Rumford had measured
in a precise manner the heat produced in the boring of a cannon
in the royal foundry at Munich; and to leave no doubt as to the
origin of this heat, he determined the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the solid
bronze and of the rubbed-off portions of this metal. No sensible
difference appeared to exist between the two speci<U+FB01>c heats. The
only reasonable explanation that could be given of the pheno
menon according to the material theory of heat was thus perem p
torily refuted. It had indeed been admitted that in pulverized
 bodies the speci<U+FB01>c heat was much less than in the same bodies
 in a compact condition, and it would certainly follow from this
hypothesis that the pulvérization of a body by friction ought to
 liberate heat. But it was forgotten that friction liberates heat
 even when there is no alteration of the rubbing surfaces. The
 incorrectncss of the hypothesis was moreover shown by the
 experiment of Rnmford.
    The experiment of Davy, later by ayear than that of Rumford,
 was, if possible, still more conclusive. Two pieces of ice rubbed
 against each other by Davy were rapidly melted, and a liquid
 was produced the speci<U+FB01>c heat of which is more than double
 that of ice. Davy, moreover, had taken all care to prove that
 the liberation of heat by friction was not compensated by any
 sensible absorption of heat in any portion of the apparatus.
    Among the contemporaries of Rumford and Davy, Young was
 the only man who comprehended the full bearing of their expe
 riments. In his ‘ Lectures on Natural Philosophy,’ published in
  1807, he has connected them with his immortal discoveries on
 the nature of light, and he almost arrived at the true principle
 of the mechanical theory of heat. He was the <U+FB01>rst to call in
 question the principle, assumed by Lavoisier and Laplace, of

470                  M. Verdet’s Historic Notice of
which I have <U+FB01>rst spoken. It has not perhapsbeen demonstrated
in a single case, says Young in his ‘Lecture on the Measure
ment and Nature of Heat,’ that the quantity of heat absorbed in
any phenomenon is precisely equal to the heat disengaged when the
phenomenon is inverted. In this simple doubt was virtually con
tained the whole mechanical theory of heat*.
    Unhappily this was an epoch in which the law of double refrac
tion was considered as an argument in favour of the theory of
 emission; it was the epoch when the most beautiful memoirs of
 Fresnel remained forgotten, and for years ran the risk of being
lost. Thus when in 18241 the original mind of Sadi Carnot,
struck by the spectacle of the industrial revolution accomplished
by the steam-engine, sought to discover the general laws of the
motive power of <U+FB01>re, he did not hesitate for an instant to take
as the point of departure for his reasonings the materiality, and
consequently the indestructibility of caloric-I-. I shall perhaps
astonish you if I add that, in spite of this fundamental mistake,
the name of Sadi Carnot and that of his learned commentator
M. Clapeyron, will always occupy an important place in the
history of the science. Sadi Carnot is the author of the forms
of reasoning employed incessantly in the mechanical theory; it
is in his essay that we <U+FB01>nd the <U+FB01>rst examples of those cycles of
operations which consist in taking a body in a certain state,
causing it to pass to a different one by following a certain path,
and then causing it to return by a different route to its <U+FB01>rst con
dition. M. Clapeyron has cleared up what remained obscure in
the memoir of Carnot, and has shown how we may translate
analytically, and represent geometrically, this mode of reasoning,
so new and so fruitfuli. These two geometers have in a manner
created the logic of the science. VVhen the veritable principles
had been discovered, nothing was necessary but to introduce them
into the forms of that logic ; and it may be believed that, without
the previous labour of Carnot and Clapeyron, the progress of the
new theory would not have been nearly so rapid as it has been.
    Finally, I will terminate this <U+FB01>rst part of my historic exposi
 tion by mentioning that M. Séguin, in a memoir published in
 1839, and more especially devoted to political economy than to
physics, has considered the steam-engine from a point of view
which closely resembles the manner in which I attempted in our
   * Lectures on Natural Philosophy, vol. i. p. 651 of the edition of 180'/'.
Young admits that the equality of the heat absorbed and the heat liberated
is probable ; but the simple utterance of a doubt regarding this sort of axiom
in 1807 is very worthy of remark.

   I now come to the labours, from 1842 to 1849, which have de
<U+FB01>nitely established the science.        These labours are the exclusive
work of three men, who without concert, without even knowing
each other, arrived at the same time, and almost in the same
manner, at the same ideas. The priority in the order of publi
cation belongs without any doubt to the German physician,
Jules Robert Mayer, whose name has occurred so often in these
discourses ; and it is interesting to know that it was in re<U+FB02>ecting
on certain observations in his medical practice that he conceived
the idea of the necessity of a relation of equivalence between work
and heat. The variations of the difference of colour of arterial
and venous blood directed his attention to the theory of respira
tory phenomena. He soon saw in the respiration of animals the
origin of their motive power; and the comparison of animals to
thermic machines afterwards suggested to him the important
principle with which his name will remain for ever connected.
Such is the account which he gives himself of the development
of his ideas, in his memoir “On Organic Motion and Nutrition,”
published in 1845. His <U+FB01>rst paper, entitled “ Remarks on the
 Forces of Inanimate Nature,” published in 1842 in Liebig’s
 Annalen, does not, however, contain any allusion to vital pheno
mena, and deduces simply the equivalence of heat and work from
the comparative study of friction, of the steam-engine, and of the
properties of gases.
    We <U+FB01>nd moreover in this memoir a <U+FB01>rst determination of the
mechanical equivalent of heat deduced from the properties of
gases, perfectly exact in principle, but the result of which, in
consequence of the inaccurate values of the coe<U+FB01>icient of expan
 sion and the speci<U+FB01>c heat of air which were current in science
twenty years ago, is considerably wide of the truth. The memoir
 “ On Organic Motion and Nutrition,” and the “ Celestial Dyna
 mics,” published in 1848, contain physiological and astronomical
 applications of the new principle, and show that, notwithstanding
 a scienti<U+FB01>c education imperfect on many points, Mayer compre
 hended the bearing of his discovery, and knew how to follow it up.
    Towards the epoch of the <U+FB01>rst publication of Mayer, M. Cold
 ing, Hydraulic Engineer of the city of Copenhagen, presented
 to the Royal Scienti<U+FB01>c Society of Denmark a series of memoirs
 on the power of the steam-engine and gas-engine, which con
 tained ideas almost identical with those of Mayor, and an ex
 perimental determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat
 by friction, which does not appear to be very exact. These
 titles suf<U+FB01>ce to assure to M. Colding a place among the disco
 verers of the new theory.        But we ought to remember that the
          * Etude sur l’in_<U+FB02>uence des chemins defer, p. 380.

472       Historic Notice of the Mechanical Theory of Heat.
various memoirs of this physicist, written in a language the
knowledge of which is but little extended, and <U+FB01>rst printed
several years after their presentation to the Academy of Copen
hagen, have exerted scarcely any in<U+FB02>uence on the subsequent
developments of the science.
   The third discoverer of whom it rests with me to speak, Mr.
Joule, is the one who perhaps has done most for the demonstra
tion of the new principle, and for its <U+FB01>nal adoption. His <U+FB01>rst in
vestigation, published only in 1843, is incontestibly posterior by
some months to the <U+FB01>rst publications of Mayer and Colding. It
contains experiments on the heat developed by induced currents,
and does not appear to have excited much attention. It is to
his experiments in 1845 on the calori<U+FB01>c eifects of the dilatation
and compression of gases that belongs the privilege of giving the
right of citizenship in science to the new ideas *. It is his expe
riments on friction that have given the <U+FB01>rst determination of
the mechanical equivalent of heat which is worthy of con<U+FB01>dence.
It is his views on the constitution of gases which <U+FB01>rst gave the
only example, up to the present time, of a complete explanation
of a phenomenon of which the theory might predict the laws,
but could not indicate the mechanism.
   Immediately after these three names, that of M. Helmholtz
ought to appear, for having in 1847, in his memoir on the
Conservation of Force, united in a body the doctrine of the new
ideas, and for having made fruitful and important applications
of them to the phenomena of induction, to electro-chemistry,
and to thermo-electric currents.
   Lastly, the <U+FB01>nal constitution of the science, the clear and
methodical establishment of the proper processes of investi
gation and of reasoning, as also its application in detail to the
theory of machines, are principally due to the eiforts of three
authors, which a1'e the last that I will cite—MM. Clausius,
Macquorn Rankine, and William Thomson. Their most im
portant researches have been published between 1849 and 1851.
   Since the epoch last referred to, there have been many other
researches conducted under the inspiration of the same ideas.
I have had occasion to refer to several of them during the course
of these two lectures. Others are mentioned in the table of

already published to be maintained throughout. This portion, con
sisting altogether of 384 pages, carries the work as far as “ Arsenic ” ;
so that a considerable share of Part III. will evidently still be needed
 to make room for all the articles which come under the <U+FB01>rst letter
 of the alphabet. With more than an eighth of the total space
 assigned to the work thus occupied by the letter A, it is easy to
 foresee that the subjects falling under the remaining letters must
 be treated very much less fully, or else that the book must be ex
 tended considerably beyond the limits at present contemplated. A
 new edition of the <U+FB01>rst part (comprising the letters A to E) of the
 great German Dictionary of Chemistry, commenced twenty-six years
 ago by Liebig, Poggendortf, and Wohler, was begun in 1856 and
 <U+FB01>nished last year. Here the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve letters of the alphabet extend
 over more than 4500 pages, and the letter A alone over 1720 pages,
 while in the <U+FB01>rst edition, which is at last approaching the other end
 of the alphabet, we <U+FB01>nd the letter S occupying upwards of 1400
 pages. Of course the plan of Mr. Watts’s Dictionary is altogether
 less comprehensive than that of the German one; yet, on examining
 the Parts before us, we <U+FB01>nd that the difference in the amount of
 really useful information contained in the two works is much less
 than the mere consideration of the size of each would have led us
 to expect. Mr. Watts has very judiciously economized space by
 the total omission of articles of small importance, instead of cur
 tailing those devoted to more important subjects. In some instances,
 indeed, we find more information in his work than in the correspond
 ing articles of its much more bulky Germ an contemporary. The adop
 tion of a close but clear type, and of a style that is condensed with
  out being awkward, have also tended to increase still further the
  amount of matter which could be compressed into a small space.
  But, making every allowance for the saving thus effected, we cannot
  think that 4000 pages, instead of the 3000 which sixteen Parts such
  as the two already issued would provide, would be found to afford
  anything more than the space absolutely necessary for the comple
 tion of the work in a satisfactory manner. We have said so much
  on this point because we feel that it would be a serious loss to
  British science if the utility of a work like the present were to be

 474                 Notices respecting New Books.
 sacri<U+FB01>ced through the desire to compress it within limits that are
 obviously too narrow.
     Probably the <U+FB01>rst point that will strike the attention of every
 reader of this work, is the fact that the scale of atomic weights
 adopted in it is the so-called “unitary” scale proposed twenty
 years ago by Gerhardt. It is an important indication of the direc
 tion in which chemical opinion has been moving of late years, that
 Mr. Watts—a chemist of far too much experience and too sound
judgment to have been influenced by the mere charms of novelty;
 should have found it desirable to adopt Gerhardt’s notation, and the
 general system of ideas of which that notation is the exponent, in a
 work which is in no way designed to advocate any particular set of
 theoretical views, but simply to set forth in as clear and direct a
 manner as possible the results of chemical investigation. Whatever
 objections some chemists may still urge against this system, it is
 a fact, which can no longer be overlooked, that the school by which
 it has been adopted has acquired a degree of importance which
 makes it necessary for every one engaged in chemical pursuits to be
 acquainted with it; and hence a work, such as the present, in which
 this system is consistently carried out and applied to all chemical
 compounds, acquires avalue that is quite independent of any opinion
 as to the truth or falsehood of the system itself.      For the bene<U+FB01>t,
 however, of persons who are likely to consult the Dictionary for
 the sake of practical rather than of scientific information, the old
 formulae, as well as the new, are given in all articles to which they
 may be expected to refer.
     Although by far the greater portion of the two Parts now before us
is the work of Mr. Watts himself, several very valuable articles have
 been contributed by other writers, who seem to have well seconded
 the editor in endeavouring to bring down to the most recent date
 possible the information on the various subjects treated by them.
     One specially valuable characteristic of the work is the fulness
 with which analytical processes of all kinds are described. Besides
 an. excellent series of articles devoted to the various branches of
 analytical chemistry (Inorganic Analysis, by Mr. F. T. Conington ;
 Organic Analysis, elementary and proximate, by the Editor; V0111
 metric Analysis of Liquids and Solids, by Mr. Dittmar ; and V0111
 metric Analysis of Gases, by Dr. Russell), and those on Acidimetry,
 Alkalimetry, and Alcoholometry, all of which are very complete, we
 find under the heading of each of the more important substances._.
 such as Acetic Acid, Ammonia, Antimony, Arsenic--a detailed ac
 count of the processes to be adopted for its detection and quantitative
estimation.
1-.. In a work of such magnitude, occasional errors in detail must be
looked for as a matter of course ; but almost all those that we have ob
served are either obviously misprints, or have probably arisen from
the length of time which the work has necessarily occupied in going
through the press. To this latter cause is also doubtless due the
occasional omission of any mention of very recent discoveries, F01
instance, in the article ALKALI, we <U+FB01>nd nothing about caesium Qi

                     Notices respecting New Books,                    475
 rubidium, and under AMIDES we miss a good many newly discovered
 " polyammonias.” At page 214, however, a paragraph, apparently
 inserted at the last moment, refers us to LIGHT for a description of
 the methods of spectrum-analysis ; so that we may hope that other
 opportunities will be found for supplying, in the course of the work,
 all similar omissions.
    In conclusion, we have only to say that Mr. Watts is producing‘
 a work of which the value will be at once apparent to every chemist,
 and one which is admirably adapted for use as a book of reference
 by those who, though not constantly occupied with chemical pur
 suits, nevertheless require from time to time to consult some trust
 worthy and nearly complete authority on particular points ; while,
 from the clearness of the style and the fulness of information on
 many subjects that are hardly treated at all in the common text
 books, many parts of his Dictionary may be read with great advan-_
 tags by every chemical student who has already mastered the <U+FB01>rst‘
 rudiments of his science.
   Dual Arithmetic, a New Art. Invented and developed by Omvxn
                Brave. London: Bell and Daldy, 1863.
    No greater service can be rendered to mathematical science than
 the facilitation of its ultimate reduction to numerical measurement.
 Notwithstanding all that has been done to ease calculation, still the‘
 actual work of arithmetic remains the great incubus.           All prac
 tical mathematics resolve themselves ultimately into numbers, and,
 sooner or later, every practical mathematician has to face the arith
 metical labour; yet there still remains, as a reproach to science, the
 difficulty of saying whether this ultimate reduction is most feared by
 those who, to avoid it, take refuge in analysis or in geometry, or by
 those to whom a superior energy or a different taste gives a mastery
 over its laborious detail.
    We receive with a satisfaction, altogether independent of its suc-‘
cess, any attempt like the present to place arithmetic on a more
compact basis.
    Mr. Byrne has done himself a great injustice by neglecting to place
 prominently before his reader a distinct and logical statement of the
intention and objects of his method, and of the means by which he__
attains them. We conceive that we shall be doing a service to him,
as well as to our readers, by endeavouring partially to supplythis defect.
We say partially, because we feel that our perusal of a work, the
completion of which is avowedly reserved for future treatises, can
but imperfectly replace the clear and symmetric idea which exists in‘
the author’s mind, and of which, as we must be permitted to say, it
is his part to present a clear and symmetric statement to the public.
If we fail in reproducing his meaning with exactness, the blame
must fall on him, for presenting us with a chaos of rules, examples,_
and notes, without any logical guide beyond a table of contents.

     It will be obvious that the product or sum of any two numbers so
 represented is expressible at sight, without further labour than‘ the
 multiplication or division of the numbers lying to the left of the
 symbol +, and the addition or subtraction of the numbers to its
 right.    Thus the product of

the numbers to the right of the arrow being, in fact, indices.
 _ We must refer to the treatise itself for the mode of expressing
ordinary numbers in a notation of this kind, and of comparing dif
ferent expressions of the same number, whether absolute or approxi
mate. It is obvious that every number may be expressed in an in<U+FB01>
nite variety of ways under this notation. For instance, 1001 may
be expressed indifferently as
                         1o0Lioto,Loro1tL
Whether this indeterminate character of the notation be an advan
tage or a hindrance, we have not sufficient experience to decide.

   In practice, this index, which may be always taken ad libitum, is
a <U+FB01>xed number. Mr. Byrne chooses for this the number 8 and sup
presses the index. The result is that the expression X=_l or 8-4]
means nothing more than that w is the logarithm of X to the base
P00000001, or 1+ 1-01“, and that its use as such is the key to the
whole work done.               ~                           >        '
   We confess to considerable disappointment at discovering this to
be the “resultant” of the method. It is quite certain that arith-'
metic is not to be revolutionized or even materially simpli<U+FB01>ed by
such means as this; and we are driven to the conclusion that there
is more merit in the attempt than value in the result. After a
perusal made with sufficient care to discover a few typographical
errors in a carefully printed book, we <U+FB01>nd ourselves obliged to state
that all Mr. Byrne’s arithmetical skill and ingenuity do not enable
him to solve his problems with as little work as a good selection of
ordinary methods would require. We rise from our perusal far more
convinced of the power of the author than of his method.
   Mr. Byrne concludes his introduction as follows :—
   “In my works on Algebra and the Calculus, which are being
prepared for publication, the whole subject and its different applica
tions will be treated in a general and exhaustive manner. My work
on the Calculus, to be termed the ‘ Calculus of Form,’ unfolds a new
science, and establishes modern analysis on a purely mathematical
basis, rejecting the reasoning of the differential and other methods.”
   We do not quite understand what reasoning it is that Mr. Byrne
 proposes to reject, or why. But we gather that he entertains some
objection to the existing systems, probably thinking them illogical,
complex, and prolix. Now we are not bigoted to them. We are
painfully aware of their de<U+FB01>ciencies in the last two respects, and we
are not without some misgivings on the <U+FB01>rst head. But we may be
forgiven for reminding Mr. Byrne that a proposal of change is as
 disagreeable as a dose of physio, and requires even more tact in its
administration.    If he expects to gain the ear of mathematicians,
he must do what he has not done in his ‘ Dual Arithmetic ’—give a
clear and succinct statement of his plan, his principle, and his results,
so that the educated reader may see the. value of the prize which is

    Mr. Gore on the Properties of Electra-deposited Antimony. 479
     The determination of the optical constants of these substances
leads to many interesting conclusions; among which the following
may be stated z»
     1. That transparent bodies, as well as metals, possess a coefficient
of re<U+FB02>exion, which is sometimes very sensible, although there are
bodies in which it is very small.
     2. That Silver is the only substance which possesses the qualities
of brillitmcy and lustre, represented by the coe<U+FB02>icients of refraction
and re<U+FB02>exion, in a high degree.
     3. Of the metals which have high brilliancy and little lustre may
be named Mercury, Palladium, Zinc, and Iron.
     4. Of the metals which have high lustre and little brilliancy
there are only two, Gold and Copper.
     5. Results of the highest interest appear from an examination of
the optical constants of the alloys of copper and zinc, which cannot
be given in an abstract.
     6. In the details of the several experiments, the author calls atten
tion to several remarkable laws, or indications of laws, which appear
to him to require some notice from theorists.
     a. When the azimuth of the incident beam is less than the circular
limit, the axis major of the re<U+FB02>ected ellipse, at the principal incidence,
lies in the plane of incidence; but when the azimuth is greater than
the circular limit, it is perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and
as the incidence varies, the axis major twice approaches to a minimum
distance from that plane.
     6. There appears to the author to be some indication in the expe
  .                                    .                   .         J .
nments on metals, that the quantity known to theorists as (1)19,
not a function of the incidence only; a conclusion which, if correct,
would require the intervention of a third wave suppressed, or some
such theoretical supposition, to account for it.
     “ On the Properties of Electra-deposited Antimony.”       By George
Gore, Esq.
     In this communication the author has described two additional
kinds of electro-deposited antimony possessing the property of evol
ving heat ; one of them is obtained from a solution of bromide, and
the other from a solution of iodide of antimony ; there is also given
additional information respecting the peculiar heating-antimony ob
tained from the aqueous terchloride.
     The following is a brief statement and comparison of some of the
properties of the three kinds of thermically active antimony. The
speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the chloride deposit is 5'8, the bromide one 5'44,
and the one from the iodide 5'25. The amount of heat evolved is
greatest with the one from the chloride solution, and least with that
from the iodide; the former evolves all its heat at 60° Fahr.,
contact with a red-hot wire, the bromide one at 280° Fahr.,' whilst
the iodide one requires a temperature of 340° Fahr.; the latter also
acquires a reddish-brown colour by exposure to solar light.
     The chloride deposit contains about 6-3 per cent. of saline matter,
                                  2K2

480     '                  Royal Society :—
the bromide one about 20, and the one from the iodide liquid about
22'2.     The quantities deposited by a single equivalent of zinc were
about 42'5 in the chloride, 50 in the bromide, and 51 in the iodide
solution.
   The explanation proposed of their formation is, that the antimony
in depositing, being in the “nascent” state, combines chemically in
a feeble manner with the saline ingredients of the electrolyte; but
the complete sources of the evolved heat remain undecided.

   “On the Forces concerned in producing the larger Magnetic
Disturbances.” By Balfour Stewart, M.A., F.R.S.
   The author begins by alluding to a previous communication made
to the Royal Society, containing an account of the great magnetic
storm of August 28-September 7, 1859, in which he had shown
that the <U+FB01>rst e<U+FB01>'ect of this great disturbance was to diminish in
intensity both components of the earth’s magnetic force at Kew,
during a period of about six hours. Such an effect, he argues, can
scarcely be supposed due to any combination of earth-currents, of
which the period is only a few minutes.
   But another appearance is noticeable on the photographic curves
which regard the progress of this great disturbance.
   While the great wave of force had a period of about six hours,
there were superimposed upon it smaller disturbances having a
period of a few minutes, and therefore comparable in this respect
with earth-currents.
   These smaller disturbances are of very frequent occurrence, and
show themselves in the Kew magnetograph curves as serrated appear
ances, occasionally magni<U+FB01>ed into peaks and hollows.
   Two hypotheses may be entertained regarding them.
   lst. They may be conceived to represent small and rapid changes
in the intensity of the whole disturbing force which acts upon the
magnet ; and since (as stated above) this force cannot be supposed
due to earth-currents, so neither can its variations be caused by these.
   2nd. The peaks and hollows may be supposed due to the direct
action of earth-currents upon the magnets.
   The following argument is advanced to show that the second of
these hypotheses is untenable.
   Let us compare together the two magnetic disturbances of August
and September 1859 and August 1860; and suppose the peaks
and hollows of the disturbance curves of these dates to be caused by
earth-currents. This would require that currents of the same name
should have simultaneously travelled between Margate and Ramsgate,
and between Ramsgate and Ashford during the latter disturbance,
whereas during the former these currents should have been of
different names, that is to say, the one positive and the other negative.

 On the Forces concerned in producing Magnetic Disturbances. 481
According to Mr. Walker's observations, however, on both these
occasions a current between Margate and Ramsgate was simultaneous
with one of the same name between Ramsgate and Ashford.
    Thus, if we adopt the second hypothesis, it would appear that
these lines ought to have been a<U+FB01>"ected differently on these two
occasions, whereas by observation they were affected in the same
manner; the conclusion is that this hypothesis does not represent
the truth.
    The author then shows that earth-currents observed simultaneously
with a very abrupt disturbance which commenced about 1 1h 17”‘ A.M.,
September 1, 1859, would lead us to infer that the former are induced
currents due to sudden and rapid changes in the magnetism of the
earth.
    Referring now to the <U+FB01>rst hypothesis, which asserts that the peaks
and hollows represent small and rapid changes in the intensity of
the whole disturbing force which acts upon the magnet, it would
follow that these peaks and hollows should in this case comport
themselves with regard to the three elements of the earth’s magnetism
in the same way as the whole disturbing force of which they repre
sent the changes. Thus, if the tendency of the great body of the
disturbing force is to raise the curves for the three elements simul
taneously, then a small peak in one element should correspond to a
peak, and not to a hollow, in the other two. But if, on the other hand,
the tendency of the disturbing force is to raise one of the curves
and lower the other two, then a peak in the <U+FB01>rst should correspond
to a hollow in the others.
    This is shown to be the case in the disturbances extending from
the beginning of 1858 to the end of 1860 ; and the author therefore
concludes that peaks and hollows represent small and rapid changes
in the intensity of the whole disturbing force which acts upon the
magnet.
    It is then shown that use may be made of these peaks and hollows,
if we wish to analyse the forces concerned in producing disturbances.
Let us suppose that several independent forces are concerned. It is
very unlikely that a small and rapid change takes place at the same
instant in more than one of these. The measurement therefore of
simultaneous abrupt changes for the three elements may enable us to
determine the character of one of the elementary disturbing forces at
work.
   It is not even necessary to con<U+FB01>ne ourselves to very rapid changes,
provided we take peaks or hollows which present a similar appearance
for all the elements, as such can only be produced by the action of a
single force.
   The author then shows that a peak of the horizontal force always
corresponds to a peak of the vertical force, and not to a hollow, and
that, when similar peaks are compared together, the horizontal-force
peak is always as nearly as possible double in size that of the vertical
 orce.
   This curious fact would imply that the resolved portion of the
disturbing force which acts in the plane of the magnetic meridian is

482                        Royal Society :—
always in nearly the same direction.     The dip of this resolved por
tion will be about 17%°.
   It is also found that a declination peak corresponds to a peak of
either force, except in the case of the great disturbance of August to
September 1859, during the most violent portion of which a peak of
the declination corresponded to a hollow in either force.    The length,
however, of a declination peak does not bear an invariable ratio to
that of a force peak—this ratio varying much from one disturbance
 to another, but not much from one part to another of the same dis
turbance.     In this last case, however, the variation of the ratio,
 although not great, is yet greater than that of the ratio between the
 two force peaks; so that it is somewhat difficult to obtain similar
 peaks when comparing the declination curve with that of either
 force.
    It thus appears that the force which acts upon the magnets does
 not vary much from one part to another of the same disturbance,
 and it therefore becomes possible to give the elements of this force,
 which will thus characterize the disturbance.
    The author then attempts, by means of comparing similar appear
 ances, to represent the force at work for each disturbance between the
beginning of 1858 to the end of 1860. The great disturbance of
August to September 1859 is here remarkable as one in which two
independent disturbing forces seem to have acted at once,—one of
these being of the normal type, in which all the elements were raised
or depressed together, while in the other the declination was raised
when both elements of the force were depressed.
    It will be observed that this method of analysis does not completely
 determine the disturbing force, but merely <U+FB01>xes the line of its
resultant action, along which the force itself may be either positive
or negative; or, again, there may be two nearly opposite forces acting
against one another, the visible disturbance denoting merely the
difference in strength between the two; and there is some reason to
think that this last supposition represents the true state of the
 case.
    For while the de<U+FB01>nite relation which exists between the peaks of
the two force-components shows that all disturbing forces affect these
 in nearly the same way, yet sometimes, though very rarely, in the
 general progress of the curve one of the elements will be above the
 normal while the other is below it. Now, this may be accounted for
in the following manner. Suppose we have a disturbance producing
 an elevation in the horizontal force represented by +40, and one in
the vertical force represented by +20. This will be of the normal
 type. Suppose now that at the same time we have another force
 nearly similar, whose action on the two force-elements is represented
 by -39 ——2l. This is also suf<U+FB01>ciently near the normal type. The
 result of these two disturbances superimposed will be +1 and -1,
 showing that the one element is raised above its normal position,
while the other is depressed below it. This idea of two opposite
forces acting simultaneously in disturbances is that entertained by
 General Sabine from other considerations.

 Transmission ofElectric Signals througll Submarine Cables.           483
   “Experimental Researches on the Transmission of Electric Signals
through Submarine Cables.”—Part I. Laws of Transmission through
various lengths of one Cable. By Fleeming Jenkin, Esq.
   Professor W. Thomson has in various papers stated and de
veloped the mathematical theory of the transmission of signals
through long submarine cables. The present paper contains an ex
perimental research into the same subject. The conclusions arrived
at by theory are con<U+FB01>rmed by the experiments, and some new facts
of considerable importance are established.
   All the observations in this part of the paper were made on the
Red Sea cable, when coiled in iron tanks at Birkenhead.
   By observation on a re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer, an arrival-curve was
obtained for various lengths of cable with various arrangements of
battery. By arrival-curve is meant the curve representing the
gradual rise of the current at the remote end of the cable when the
near end is put in permanent connexion with the batter .            '
   The analysis of the various arrival-curves led to the tbllowing con
clusions :
   l. “ The electromotive force has no appreciable effect on the
velocity with which the current is transmitted.
   2. “ The rate of decrease in the current at the remote end, after
contact has been made for a given time with earth at the near end, is
the same as the rate of increase observed after making contact with
the battery at the near end for an equal time.”
   With reference to the use of alternate positive and negative
currents as compared with alternate connexion with the positive or
negative pole of a battery and earth,               _    '
   3. It was found that the “reversals in no way modi<U+FB01>ed the
arrival-curve during its increase, nor did they modify the curve
showing the decrease of the current.”
   The effect of ordinary morse signals was next observed on the gal
vanometer through various lengths of cable.
   The changes in the received current, caused by repeated dots, by
repeated dashes, by dots and dashes alternately, and by dots and
dashes separated by a pause, were observed at dilferent speeds.
Re eated dots, when represented graphically, give an even wavy line
with large amplitudes of oscillation for slow speeds or through short
lengths, but rapidly approaching a straight line as the speed of
transmission or the length of the cable was augmented.
   If the maximum permanent de<U+FB02>ection caused by the battery be
called 100, dots sent at the rate of 15 per minute through 2192
knots of cable caused oscillations in the received current of 12'? per
cent. ; and sent at the rate of 50 per minute, this caused an oscillation
of less than 1 per cent.
   4. From this it was concluded that “on all submarine cables
there is a limit to the number of signals which can be sent per mi
nute, a limit which cannot be exceeded by any ingenious contrivance.”
   If we continue to call the maximum de<U+FB02>ection due to permanent
contact 100, the mean height of the current observed during dots is

 484                         Royal Society :—
 below 50, on account of time lost between the two contacts while
 moving the sending-key.
    When dashes or lines are sent, 2'. e. long contacts with the battery
 followed b    short earth-contacts, an even wavy line is obtained, the
 mean heig t of which is above 50; and when dots and dashes are
 combined, the curves representing the changes of the current become
 very irregular, sometimes <U+FB02>ying above 50, sometimes falling below
 this line; and when long pauses, or a succession of long battery-con
 tacts are introduced, the curves become hopelessly confused, especi
 ally at the higher speeds, so that the signals cannot be disentangled,
 even when the change of current can be continually followed. From
 this it is concluded that,
    5. “There is a wide margin between the limit set to the speed of
 transmission by the gradual diminution of the received signals, and
 that set by their interference.”
    Reverse currents have been recommended as a means of accelerat
 ing the rate of speaking through submarine cables. Their effect was
 tested; the arrival-curves and signal-curves obtained by their use
 differed in no way from those obtained by simple currents and earth
 contacts.    Hence it was concluded that,
    6. “ The use of reverse currents does not alter the limit set by the
 gradual diminution of the received signals, nor that set by their in
terference.”
    It occurred to the author that, if by any means the current could
invariably after each signal be brought to one constant strength and
maintained at that strength between the signals, the confusion of
interference would be avoided. He considered that, if the second or
earth-contact of each signal bore a <U+FB01>t proportion to the <U+FB01>rst contact,
this object might be effected ; and he considered that a succession of
very short pairs of contacts of a certain relative length, would main
tain the current at the constant <U+FB01>nal strength during any pause sepa
rating signals. He therefore prepared a paper band with openings cut
so as to make pairs of equal battery- and earth-contacts for dots, long
battery-contacts, followed by nearly equal earth-contacts, for a dash,
and a succession of pairs of very short contacts wherever a pause was
required, the battery contacts being rather the shorter of the two.
   The success of this plan was such that the signals were distinctly
recorded, not only by the galvanometer, but by a relay when the total
variations caused by the shortest signals were invisible on the galvano
meter, i. e. even less than 1 per cent. of the maximum <U+FB01>nal current.
   7. Hence it was concluded that by the means adopted, or by
analogous means, “ signals can be sent without confusion at any
speed which will allow the shortest signal used to cause a sensible
variation in the received current.”
   These experiments were tried on dry cable coiled in iron tanks, and
might therefore not be applicable to extended and submerged cables.
   The author has, however, proved that the retardation and insula
tion of an iron-covered cable are very little affected by the mere pre
sence or absence of water; and wherever the conclusions obtained
from the experiments agree with the deductions of theory, it is clear

    Transmission ofElectric Signals through Submarine Cables.                485
   that the experiments and theory con<U+FB01>rm one another, and the con
   clusions may be safely applied to the practical case of a submerged
   and extended cable ; for it is impossible to suppose that results due
   only to an accidental arrangement of the cable should by chance
   coincide with the deductions from a defective hypothesis.
       The experimental arrival-curves do not exactly agree with the
   curve given by Professor W. Thomson (Proceedings of the Royal
   Society, 1855.       Phil. Mag. 1856).
       The experimental curve approaches its maximum much more slowly
   than the mathematical curve, and continues to rise l or 2 per cent.
   long after all effects from retardation as given by theory would cease.
       Some of this effect may be due to the mutual in<U+FB02>uence of the coils
  of the cable* ; but the greater part of the discrepancy is due to the
   change of the insulation due to continued electri<U+FB01>cation, <U+FB01>rst published
   by the author in a paper read before the Royal Society in 1859-601".
       The identity of the arrival-curve during increase and decrease
  shows that,
       8. “The apparent increase of resistance of the gutta percha is
   rather due to an absorption of electricity which is again given out,
   than to a real change in the conductivity of the materia .”
      The theoretical and practical COI1ClllSl0I1S on the effect of repeated
  signals were next examined. Little change of insulation could take
  place during the repeated signals, because the greater part of the
   cable remained continually electri<U+FB01>ed ; and greater coincidence between
  the experiments and the theory was therefore to be expected.
      The curve expressing the rate at which the amplitude of oscillation
  in the received current diminishes as the number of signals increases,
V was constructed from Professor W. Thomson’s equationst ; and the
  experimental amplitudes with 1500, 1802, and 2192 knots of cable
  in circuit, were found to coincide in the most accurate manner with
  this curve—-establishing completely the soundness of the mathemati
  cal theory.
       9. These results prove beyond all question that “ the rate of trans
  mission varies as the square of the length, whether by rate of trans
  mission he meant that speed at which repeated signals fail to produce
  any sensible effect, or the rate producing so great an amplitude that
  common hand-signals can be received without confusion.”
       It is also found (when small compared with the total resistance)

  duces nearly the same e<U+FB01>'ect as the addition of an equal length of sub

    “ On the Thermal Effects of Fluids in Motion.”—Part IV.            By
J. P. Joule, LL.D., F.R.S., and Professor W. Thomson, F.R.S.
    A brief notice of some of the experiments contained in this paper
has already appeared in the ‘ Proceedings.’ Their object was to
ascertain with accuracy the lowering of temperature, in atmospheric
air and other gases, which takes place on passing them through a
porous plug from a state of high to one of low pressure. Various
pressures were employed, with the result (indicated by the authors in
their Part II.) that the thermal effect is approximately proportional to
the difference of pressure on the two sides of the plug.     The experi
ments were also tried at various temperatures, ranging from 5° to
 98° Cent., and have shown that the thermal effect, if one of cooling,
 is approximately proportional to the inverse square of the absolute
 temperature. Thus, for example, the refrigeration at the freezing
 temperature is about twice that at 100° Cent. In the case of hy
 drogen, the reverse phenomenon of a rise of temperature on passing
 through the plug was observed, the rise being doubled in quantity
 when the temperature of the gas was raised to 100°. This result is
 conformable with the experiments -of Regnault, who found that
 hydrogen, unlike other gases, has its elasticity increased more rapidly
 than in the inverse ratio of the volume. The authors have also
 made numerous experiments with mixtures of gases, the remarkable
 result being that the thermal effect (cooling) of the compound gas
 is less than it would be if the gases after mixture retained in integrity
 the physical characters they possessed while in a pure state.
    “ On the Spectra of Electric Light, as modi<U+FB01>ed by the Nature of
the Electrodes and the Media of Discharge.”           By the Rev. T. R.
Robinson, D.D., F.R.S
    The author, after referring brie<U+FB02>y to the researches of previous
inquirers, and the hypothesis now generally adopted, that the bright
lines observed in these spectra depend so absolutely on the chemical
nature of the substances present that their occurrence is an unerring
test of that presence, expresses his belief that it cannot be admitted
in its full extent without much more decisive proof than has yet been
afforded.     It assumes,
    1. That each substance has a set of lines peculiar to itself.
    2. That those lines are not produced or modi<U+FB01>ed by any molecular
agent except heat.
    3. That the spectrum of one substance is in nowise modi<U+FB01>ed by
the presence of another ; and in such cases both spectra coexist in
dependently, and are merely superposed.
    4. As may be inferred from 2, that electricity does not make
matter luminous directly, but only by heating it ; so that the electric
spectrum differs in nothing from that produced by heat of suf<U+FB01>cient
ntensity.

              Dr. Robinson on the Spectra ofElectric Light.             487
      His attention was directed to this subject several years ago by the
‘ di<U+FB01>'erence of colour of discharges in carbonic oxide at common and
  diminished pressure; and the results of his experiments appear to
   show that none of these four points is universally true.
      His apparatus ‘consisted of a powerful induction machine, with
   which a Leyden jar was connected; of prisms, <U+FB01>rst one of 45°, after
   wards one of 60° (whose deviations were reduced to the scale of the
  <U+FB01>rst); and of an optical theodolite, in which a collimator with a
   variable slit gives the beam whose spectrum is observed. He points
   out an important defect of this arrangement, and discusses the pro
   bable liabilities to error proceeding from the graduation reading only
   to minutes, and from other sources of uncertainty.
      The media of discharge were air, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and
   carbonic oxide, to which were added in some instances the vapours
   of mercury, phosphorus, and bisulphuret of carbon. For electrodes,
   23 metals and graphite were used—l5 with each of the <U+FB01>ve gases at
   common pressure and at one of 0°'2, the others only with some of
   them. In all, 185 dgferent spectra were measured, of which 93
   were at common pressure.
      At common pressure the spectra show a number of bright lines on -
 - a coloured ground, the light of which is in general stronger towards
   the red than the violet end, and strongest in the green.         In some
   this ground is so bright as to efface all but the most luminous lines:
   this is especially the case with hydrogen. Of the lines, some are very
   brilliant ; but they range in light down to the very lowest degree of
   faintness, such that (at least with the author’s apparatus) they can
   only be seen when the room is entirely dark, and are bisected with
   great di<U+FB02>iculty. They vary also in width, from a mere hair’s breadth
   to six or seven times the apparent width of the slit.
       On exhausting the tube in which the discharge is made, at <U+FB01>rst
   the only change is that the brilliant lines lose a little of their lustre,
   till at pressures varying from 3° to 0°'5 the spectrum rather suddenly
   fades away, sometimes leaving only a suspicion of one or two lines;
   with others the least-refrangible rays vanish, while the violet remain,
   though very faint, especially with aluminium.       In hydrogen spectra
   the three bright bands of this gas vanish at unequal densities; and
   it is remarkable that this occurs when the gas is diluted to the same
   proportions by mixing air with it.
      Exhausting yet further, this transition spectrum becomes again
   bright; fresh lines appear, and it is changed into a new one, which,
   however, is never as splendid as that at common pressure, especially
   at the red end, and in which the very brilliant lines are less frequent.
   This want makes the difference between the two kinds of spectra
   seem greater than it really is. Fewer lines are visible in the rare<U+FB01>ed
   media, and of these about four-tenths are not found in the spectra of
   common pressure.
       If the tables in which the measures are given be examined in re
   ference to the points alluded to as doubtful, it will be obvious,
       1. That many lines are found in all the gases, and in many, perhaps
   all the metals: the existence of such lines must be independent of

488                         Royal Society : —
the chemical nature of electrodes or media; it is otherwise with their
brightness, which may be intense with one substance and feeble with
another. This unchemical origin is still more clearly shown by a
modi<U+FB01>ed experiment of Pliicker, where the discharge is made by the
induction of glass without the presence of any metal. When the same
glass vessel was <U+FB01>lled in succession with nitrogen, oxygen, and hy
drogen, though not above twenty-three lines were seen in its capillary
tube, and those very faint, yet more than half the number were
common to two of the gases, or to the three. These might perhaps
be referred to soda or lead detached from the glass ; but some of them
are not found in those spectra.
   2. The difference between the common-pressure, transition, and
rare<U+FB01>ed spectrum shows that the character and even the existence of
certain lines depend on the mere density of the medium, the chemical
circumstances remaining unchanged.
   3. That the spectra are not merely superposed without change is
evident from several facts. The spectra of air do not in every case
show all the lines of oxygen and nitrogen, and occasionally have some
not visible in either of them: the spectrum of graphite in oxygen is
quite different from those of carbonic oxide. There is even reason to
believe that for certain lines the actions of bodies may be antagonistic.
The spectrum of mercury electrodes and mercury vapour showed
48 lines, and the author expected that the spectra for any gas with
mercury electrodes would add to those of mercury the peculiar lines of
that gas, which could thus he certainly determined. In the nitrogen
spectrum, however, 20 of the mercurial lines had disappeared, in the
hydrogen 18, and in the carbonic oxide 13.
   4. The brilliancy or visibility of the lines is very little increased by
greatly augmenting the heating power of the discharge. The two
halves of the induction machine can be made to act either consecu
tively for tension, or collaterally for quantity. In the latter case the
quantity is doubled, and therefore the heating power quadrupled.
When the apparatus is so used, the violet bands are something brighter,
but not so much so as to be noticed by an unpractised observer. The
red and green show no appreciable di<U+FB01>erence; but the author is in
clined to think the change may be greater in the ultra-violet part. He
proposes, however, to repeat the experiment with coils of much greater
power as to quantity. If electricity can produce thermic vibrations
by its transmission, there seems no 1) priori reason why it cannot
produce luminous ones; and no evidence that it cannot is known
to him.
   It seems to follow from these observations that the tendency to
show such lines belongs to matter in general, but that different forms
of it have di<U+FB01>'erent powers of manifesting that tendency, and that
those powers may sometimes interfere. If this be con<U+FB01>rmed by
further research, the result will be that, though the electric spectrum
may give useful indications to the analyst, it should never be his sole
dependence, or be trusted without full cognizance of the conditions
which may affect its indications.

Oxidation and Disoxidation ejected by the Alkaline Perozides. 489
   “On Fermat’s Theorem of the Polygonal Numbei-s.”—Second
Communication. By the Right Hon. Sir Frederick Pollock, F.R.S.,
Lord Chief Baron.                   .
   “On the Oxidation and Disoxidation e<U+FB01>'ected by the Alkaline
Peroxides.” By B. C. Brodie, Esq., F.R.S.
   A preliminary notice containing an abstract of the greater portion
of this paper has already appeared*.                           .
   Having shown that the alkaline peroxides are capable of acting
either as agents of oxidation or reduction, the author proceeds to
connect the double function of this class of peroxides with the
peculiar catalytic decompositions which they undergo. It is shown
that the catalytic decomposition may be regarded as a combination
of these two actions, an oxidation and a reduction simultaneously
occurring.    Thus in an alkaline solution of the peroxide of hydrogen,
protoxide of manganese is oxidized to peroxide.           In the acid solution
the peroxide of manganese is reduced to protoxide, the results being
expressed in the following equations :—
                   Mn2 O+H,O,=H,O-l-Mn, O2,
                   Mn2 O,-i-H2 O,,=Mn2 O+H,O-i-0,;
while the result of the catalytic decomposition effected by the peroxide
of manganese is given in the equation derived from the above by
elimination,
                          2H, O,=2H2 O+O,,
the result being the same as though the peroxide of manganese were
alternately reduced and oxidized by the alkaline peroxide. We are
thus enabled to analyse the catalytic action into its constituent de
compositions.
   That in numerous cases the catalytic change is brought about by
the intervention of intermediate compounds, which are alternately
 formed and destroyed during the action, is shown in various examples.
 For instance, the addition of a solution of peroxide of sodium to an
 excess of a solution of a protosalt of copper causes the formation of
a precipitate of a yellow peroxide of copper. If, on the other hand,
 a few drops of the salt of copper be added to an excess of the alkaline
peroxide, the same yellow body is formed, but the whole of the
 peroxide is ultimately decomposed ; after the decomposition hydrated
protoxide of copper remains. Similar phenomena occur with an
ammoniacal solution of the copper-salt. If a few drops of this
 solution be added to an ammoniacal solution of the peroxide of
hydrogen, the solution becomes of a yellow colour, and the cata
lytic action is set up. This action may continue, in dilute solutions,
for several hours ; during the whole of this time the yellow colour is
 permanent; but ultimately, when the peroxide is entirely decom

ON THE VELOCITY OF THE PROPAGATION OF SOUND IN GASEOUS
                        BODIES.    BY J. STEFAN.
 IT appears not to have been noticed that the new theory of gases
      admits of the application of Newton's formula for the velocity
of sound, if a regular arrangement of the molecules be assumed, such
as Kronig has employed in his important work on the theory of
 heat.
    Let us suppose an in<U+FB01>nitely extended space <U+FB01>lled with a gas to be
divided by parallel planes into very thin layers. When condensation
takes place in one layer, it will pass on from layer to layer with a
velocity which is the velocity of the propagation of sound. The new
theory of gases, according to which the molecules are in very rapid
progressive motion and behave like elastic balls when they strike one
 another, requires that the velocity of the progression of sound should
 be dependent upon the velocity of the progressive motion of the
 molecules. These two velocities would be exactly equal if the
 movements of the molecules were all in the direction in which the
 propagation of sound took place.
    Following Kronig, let us divide the whole space <U+FB01>lled with gas
 into equal ‘cubes, all of them placed in the same direction. Let us
suppose in each of these cubes three molecules, each one moving
 perpendicularly between two opposite sides of the cube. Let us
 assume that each molecule only strikes against molecules which are
 moving in the same line and which are situated in the neighbouring
 cubes. These hypotheses relative to the constitution of gases are
 suf<U+FB01>cient, as Kronig has shown, to explain the most important pro
 perties of gases. But in order to make the explanation simple and
 natural, it is necessary in each particular case to represent the divi
 sion of the space into elementary cubes in ade<U+FB01>nite manner.       If we,
 for example, in the case before us, arrange the cubes so that their
 two opposite sides lie parallel with the surfaces of the layers into
 which we have divided our gas, it follows that only one third of the
 molecules take part in the transmission of vis viva from layer to layer,
 the third, namely, which is composed of those molecules moving
 perpendicularly to the surfaces of the layers. In order that all the
 molecules may play the same part in this transmission, it is necessary
 so to place the elementary cubes that the diagonal drawn through two
opposite angles of the cube shall be perpendicular to the surfaces of
the layers, The velocity with which the vis viva or the condensation

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               491
from layer to layer moves is then equal to the velocity of a molecule
estimated in the direction of the diagonal. The length of this
diagonal is 4/8-, when 1 equals the length of a side of the cube.
The cosine of the angle which is formed by the diagonal and the
side of the cube equals therefore                 Let u be the velocity of
a molecule, then the component of the same, estimated from the
normals, is                            u
                                 1‘=7§
   Let p be the pressure of the gas against the unit of surface, 11 a
certain volume, In the number of molecules in the same, and m the
magnitude of a molecule, then, according to the theory developed ‘by
Kriinig and. Clausius, we have the relation

 which is Newton’s formula for the velocity of the propagation of
 sound.
    A more complete theory of the propagation of sound, grounded
 upon the new notions about the construction of gases, requires
 moreover that Laplace’s correction should be applied to the above
 formula.    In order to arrive at this, it is necessary to enter into the
 irregularities in the movements of the molecules, and perhaps also
 to consider the circumstance that, as Clausius has shown, over and
 above the progressive motions of the molecules, motions must take
 place in the molecules themselves.                     "
    The above disposition of the elementary cubes is also applicable
 to the theory of the conduction of heat, when the object in view is
 only to‘obtain an approximative value of the conducting-power.-—

                          BY DR. TSCHERMAK*.
    The general opinion in regard to these rocks is that they are of
 igneous origin,——in fact, that they are a sort of lava whose vesicular

cavities have been <U+FB01>lled with various substances. But, lately, M.
Volger has asserted that amygdaloids are merely metamorphosed
conglomerates of sedimentary origin. Indeed a closer examination
of these rocks shows the existence of three distinct varieties of them.
In the <U+FB01>rst, and by far the most common of these varieties, decom
position has begun with the crystallized minerals imbedded in the
rock, changing them into amorphous nodules, and at last leaving
only the cavities in which they were included. The second variety,
of far scarcer occurrence, owes its origin to the <U+FB01>lling up of pre
existing cavities. Those of the third variety, in conformity with
M. Volger’s views, are really metamorphosed conglomerates inclu
ding geodes, which have originally been pebbles rolled by water.
Metamorphism and pseudomorphism act within geodes exactly in
the same way as on minerals included in veins or in solid rocks.
Amygdaloids are consequently only a particular stage in those
changes which rocks are continually undergoing.—Imper.'al Academy

   I have never had the slightest intention of misrepresenting Dr.
Draper, or of detracting from the merit due to his industry and skill.
But I deny that the paper which he published in your Magazine in
1840, or the volume which he published in 1844, contains the
true theory of the motion of camphor towards the light, or that I
ever admitted that it did so. The former contains a question which,
had it been followed out and properly tested by experiment, would
have led to the true theory; but that it was not thus tested is proved
by the fact that in the volume of 1844 it was again published as a
question and nothing more.                               »
   I now leave my claims and those of Dr. Draper to be settled by
persons who may feel interest enough in the subject to read my
papers and his volume. I think they will <U+FB01>nd that the latter, full
as it is of details of ingenious experiments, leaves one as much in
doubt at the end as at the commencement, and cannot possibly be
considered as the earlier and later steps of a successful inquiry.
Indeed it is so difficult to trace any consecutive steps that the volume
was viewed by me as a whole, and as containing the latest revised
opinions of the author.

      LXVII. Remarks on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
                         By Dr. J. R. MAYER*.
 THE vast and magni<U+FB01>cent structure of the experimental
        sciences has been erected on only a few pillars.
    History teaches us that the searching spirit of man required
thousands of years for the discovery of the fundamental princi
ples of the sciences, on which the superstructure was then raised
in a comparatively short time.
    But these very fundamental propositions are nevertheless so
clear and simple, that the discovery of them reminds us, in more
 than one respect, of Columbus’s egg.
    But if, now that we are at last in possession of the truth, we
 speak of a method by the application of which the most essen
tial fundamental laws might have been discovered without waste
of time, it is not that we would criticise in any light spirit the
efforts and achievements of our forerunners: it is merely with the
object of laying before the reader in an advantageous form one
of the additions to our knowledge which recent times have
brought forth.                                                           -
    The most important——-not to say the only—rule for the genuine
investigation of nature is, to remain <U+FB01>rm in the conviction that
the problem before us is to learn to know phenomena, before
seeking for explanations or inquiring after higher causes. As
soon as a fact is once known in all its relations, it is therein
explained, and the problem of science is at an end.
' Notwithstanding that some may pronounce this a trite asser
tion, and no matter how many arguments others may bring to
oppose it, it remains none the less certain that this primary rule
has been too often disregarded even up to the most modern
times; while all the speculative operations of even the most
highly gifted minds which, instead of taking <U+FB01>rm hold of facts

as such, have striven to rise above them, have as yet borne but
barren fruit.
    We shall not here discuss the modern naturalistic philosophy
(Naturphilosqihie) further than to say that its character is already
su<U+FB01>iciently apparent from the ephemeral existence of its offspring.
But even the greatest and most meritorious of the naturalists of
antiquity, in order to explain, for example, the properties of the
lever, took refuge in the assertion that a circle is such a marvel
 lous thing that no wonder if motions, taking place in a circle,
 offer also in their turn most unusual phenomena. If Aristotle,
 instead of straining his extraordinary powers in meditations upon
 the <U+FB01>xed point and advancing line, as he calls the circle, had
 investigated the numerical relations subsisting between the
 length of the arm of the lever and the pressure exerted, he
 would have laid the foundation of an important part of human
 knowledge.
    Such mistakes, committed as they were, in accordance with
 the spirit of those times, even by a man whose many positive
 services constitute his everlasting memorial, may serve to point
 as in the opposite road which leads us surely to the goal. But if,
 even by the most correct method of investigation, nothing can
  be attained without toil and industry, the cause is to be sought
 in that divine order of the world according to which man is
  made to labour. But it is certain that already immeasurably
  more means and more toil have been sacri<U+FB01>ced to error than were
  needed for the discovery of the truth.
    The rule which must be followed, in order to lay the founda
 tions of a knowledge of nature in the shortest conceivable time,
 may be comprised in a few words.           The natural phenomena
 with which we come into most immediate contact, and which are
 of most frequent occurrence, must be subjected to a careful
 examination bymeans of the organs of sense, and this examination
 must be continued until it results in quantitative determinations
 which admit of being expressed by numbers.
    These numbers are the required foundations of an exact inves
 tigation of nature.
    Among all natural operations, the free fall of a weight is the
 most frequent, the simplest, and-—witness Newton’s apple—at
 the same time the most important. VVhen this process is ana
 lysed in the way that has been mentioned, we immediately see
 that the weight strikes against the ground the harder the greater
 the height from which it has fallen; and the problem now con
 sists in the determination of the quantitative relations subsisting
 between the height from which the weight falls, the time occupied
 by it in its descent, and its <U+FB01>nal velocity, and in expressing these
 relations by de<U+FB01>nite numbers.

    Dr. J. R. Mayeron the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat. 495
   In carrying out this experimental investigation, various diffi
culties have to be contended with; but these must and can be
overcome; and then the truth is arrived at, that for every body
a fall of 16 feet, or a time of descent of one second, corresponds
to a <U+FB01>nal velocity of 32 feet per second.
   A second phenomenon of daily occurrence, which is in appa
rent contradiction to the laws of falling bodies, is the ascent of
liquids in tubes by suction. Here, again, the rule applies, not
to allow the maxim, velle rerum cognoscere causas, to lead us into
error through useless and therefore harmful speculations con
cerning the qualities of the vacuum, and the like; on the con
trary, we must again examine the phenomenon with attention
and awakened senses ; and then we <U+FB01>nd, as soon as we put a tube
to the mouth to raise a liquid, that the operation is at <U+FB01>rst quite
easy, but that afterwards it requires an amount of exertion
which rapidly increases as the column of liquid becomes higher.
Is there, perchance, an ascertainable limit to the action of suc
tion? As soon as we once begin to experiment in this direc
tion, it can no longer escape us that there is a barometric height,
and that it attains to about 30 inches. This number is a second
chief pillar in the edi<U+FB01>ce of human knowledge.
    Question now follows question, and answer, answer.          We
 have learned that the pressure exerted by a column of <U+FB02>uid is pro
portional to its height and to the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the fluid;
We have thus determined the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the atmosphere,
and by this investigation we are led to carry up our measuring
 instrument, the barometer, from the plain to the mountains, and
 to express numerically the effect‘ produced by elevation above
the sea-level upon the height of the mercury-column. Such expe
 riments suggest the question, Whether the laws of falling bodies,
 with which we have become acquainted at the surface of the earth,
 do not likewise undergo modi<U+FB01>cation at greater distances from
 the ground. And if, as dpriori we cannot but expect, this should
 be really the case, the further question arises, In what manner is
 the number already found modi<U+FB01>ed by distance from the earth '1’
 We have thus come upon a problem the solution of which is
 attended with many difficulties ; for what has now to be accom
plished, is to make observations and carry out measurements in
places where no human foot can tread. History, however, teaches
 that the same man who put the question was also able to furnish
 the answer. Truly he could do so only through a rich treasure
 of astronomical knowledge. But how is this knowledge to be
 attained by us?
    Astronomy is, without question, even in its <U+FB01>rst principles,
 the most di<U+FB01>icult of all sciences. VVe have here to deal with
 objects and spaces which forbid all thought of experiment,
                                2L2

 496     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
 while at the same time the motions of the innumerable heavenly
 bodies are of so complicated a kind, that astronomical science,
 in its stately unfolding, is rightly considered the highest triumph
 whereof human intellect here below is able to boast.
     In accordance with the natural rule that, both in particulars
 and in general, man has to begin with that which is easiest and
 then to advance step by step to what is more di<U+FB01>icult, it might
 well be supposed that astronomy must have arrived at a <U+FB02>ourish
 ing state of development later than any other branch of human
 knowledge. But it is well known that in reality the direct
 opposite was the case, inasmuch as it was precisely in astro
 nomy, and in no other branch, that the earliest peoples attained
 to really sound knowledge. It may, indeed, be asserted that the
 science of the heavenly bodies had in antiquity reached as high
 a degree of perfection as the complete want of all the auxiliary
 sciences rendered possible.
     This early occurrence of a vigorous development of astronomy,
 which, indeed, was a necessary forerunner of the other sciences,
 since it alone furnished the necessary data for the measurement
 of time, is observable among the most various races of mankind:
 the reason of it, moreover, lies in the nature of things, and in the
 constitution of the human mind. It furnishes a remarkable
 proof that a right method is the most important condition for
 the successful prosecution of scienti<U+FB01>c inquiry.
     The explanation of this phenomenon lies in the fact that the
 need which was felt at a very early period, of a common stand
 ard for the computation of time, made it necessary to institute ob
 servations such that their results required to be expressed by de<U+FB01>
 nite numbers. There was a felt necessity of determining the time
 in which the sun accomplishes his circuit through the heavens,
 as well as the time in which the moon goes through her phases,
 and other similar questions. In order to meet this necessity,
 there was no temptation to take up the Book of Nature, after
 the manner of expositors and critics, merely to cover it with
 glosses:
               “ Mit eitler Redo wird hier nichts gescha<U+FB02>"t.”
    It was numbers that were sought, and numbers that were found.
 The overpowering force of circumstances constrained the spirit
 of inquiry into the right path, and therein led it at once from
 success to success.
     Now that after long-continued, accurate, and fortunate obser
 vations the needful knowledge of the courses and distances of
 the nearest heavenly bodies, as well as of the <U+FB01>gure and size of
 the earth, has been acquired, we are in a position to treat the
  uestion, What is the numerical in<U+FB02>uence exerted by increased
' istanee from the earth upon the known laws of falling bodies ?

     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of.Heat.        497
 and we thus arrive at the pregnant discovery that, at a height
 equal to the earth’s semidiamcter, the distance fallen through
 and the <U+FB01>nal velocity, for the <U+FB01>rst second, is four times less than
 on the surface of the earth.
    In order to pursue our inquiry, let us now return to the objects
 which immediately surround us. From the earliest times, the
 phenomena of combustion must have claimed in an especial
 degree the attention of mankind. In order to explain them, the
 ancients, in accordance with the method of their naturalistic
 philosophy, put forward a peculiar upward-striving element of
 Fire, which in conjunction with, and in opposition to, Air,
 Water, and Earth, constituted all that existed. The necessary
 consequence of this theory, which they discussed with the most
 acute sagacity, was, that in regard to the phenomena in question
 and all that related to them, they remained in complete
 ignorance.
    Here, again, it is quantitative determinations, it is numbers
 alone, which put the Ariadne’s clue in our hand. If we want
 to know what goes on during the phenomena of combustion, we
 must weigh the substances before and after they are burned;
 and here the knowledge we have already acquired of the weight
 of gaseous bodies comes to our aid. VVe then <U+FB01>nd that, in every
 case of combustion, substances which previously existed in a
 separate state enter into an intimate union with each other, and
 that the total weight of the substances remains the same both
 before and after the combination. We thus come to know the
different bodies in their separate and in their combined states,
and learn how to transform them from one of these states into the
other 5 we learn, for instance, that water is composed of two kinds
of air which combine with each other in the proportion of 1 : 8.
An entrance into chemical science is thus opened to us, and
the numerical laws which regulate the combinations of matter
 (die Stochiometrie) hang like ripe fruit before us.
    As we proceed further in our investigations, we <U+FB01>nd that in
all chemical operations-—coInbinations as well as decomposi
tions--changes of temperature occur, which, according to the
varying circumstances of different cases, are of all degrees of
intensity, from the most violent heat downwards. We have
measured quantitatively the heat developed, or counted the
number of heat-units, and have so come into possession of the
law of the evolution of heat in chemical processes.                     -
   We have long known, however, that in innumerable cases heat
makes its appearance where no chemical action is going on ; for
instance, whenever there is friction, when unelastic bodies strike
one another, and when aiériform bodies are compressed.
    What then takes place when heat is evolved in such ways as these .9

498     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
   We are taught by history that in this case also the most
sagacious hypotheses concerning the state and nature of a peculiar
“matter” of heat, concerning a “thermal acther,” whether at
rest or in a state of vibration, concerning “thermal atoms,”
supposed to exercise their functions in the interstices between
the material atoms, or other hypotheses of like nature, have not
availed to solve the problem. It is, notwithstanding, of no less
wonderfully simple a nature than the laws of the lever, about
which the founder of the peripatetic philosophy cudgelled his
brains in vain.
    After what has gone before, the reader cannot be in any
doubt about what is the course now to be pursued. Vile must again
make quantitative determinations: we must measure and count.
    If we proceed in this direction and measure the quantity of
heat developed by mechanical agency, as well as the amount of
force used up in producing it, and compare these quantities with
each other, we at once <U+FB01>nd that they stand to each other in the
simplest conceivable relati0n—that is to say, in an invariable
direct proportion, and that the proportion also holds when,
inversely, mechanical force is again produced by the aid of heat.
    Putting these facts into brief and plain language, we may say,
    Heat and motion are trunsformable one into the other.
    We cannot and ought not, however, to let this su<U+FB01>ice us.
We require to know how much mechanical force is needed
for the production of a given amount of heat, and conversely.
In other words, the law of the invariable quantitative rela
tion between motion and heat must be expressed numerically.
    When we appeal hereupon to experiment, we <U+FB01>nd that raising
the temperature of a given weight of water 1 degree of the Gen
tigrade scale corresponds to the elevation of an equal weight
to the height of about 1200 [French] feet*,
    This number is THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT or Hnar.
    The production of heat by friction and other mechanical
operations is a fundamental fact of such constant occurrence,
that the importance of its establishment on a scienti<U+FB01>c basis will
 be recognized by naturalists without any preliminary enumera-.
 tion of its useful applications; and, for the same reason, a few
 historical remarks touching the circumstances attending the dis
 covery of the foregoing fundamental law, will not be out of place
here.
    In the summer of 1840, on the occasion of bleeding Euro
peans newly arrived in Java, I made the observation that the
   * [Applying the corrected speci<U+FB01>c heat of air, M. Regnault <U+FB01>nds the

     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.           499
blood drawn from the vein of the arm possessed, almost without
exception, a surprisingly bright red colour.
   This phenomenon riveted my earnest attention. Starting
from Lavoisier’s theory, according to which animal heat is the
result of a process of combustion, I regarded the twofold change
of colour which the blood undergoes in the capillaries as a sensible
sign—-as the visible indication—-—of an oxidation going on in the
blood. In order that the human body may be kept at a uniform
temperature, the development of heat within it must bear a quan
titative relation to the heat which it loses-—a relation, that is, to
the temperature of the surrounding medium* ; and hence both
the production of heat and the process of oxidation, as well as
the dzference in colour of the two kinds of blood, must be on the
whole less in the torrid zones than in colder regions.
    In accordance with this theory, and having regard to the
known physiological facts which bear upon the question, the
blood must be regarded as a fermenting liquid undergoing slow
combustion, whose most important fuuction—that is, sustain
ing the process of combustion—is ful<U+FB01>lled without the consti
tuents of the blood (with the exception, that is, of the products
of decomposition) leaving the cavities of the blood-vessels or
coming into such relation with the organs that an interchange
of matter can take place This may be thus stated in other
words: by far the greater part of the assimilated food is burned
in the cavities of the blood-vessels themselves, for the pur
pose of producing a physical effect, and a comparatively small
quantity only serves the less important end of ultimately enter
ing the substance of the organs themselves, so as to occasion
 growth and the renewal of the worn-out solid parts.
    If hence it follows that a general balance must be struck in
the organism between receipts and expenditure, or between work
done and wear and tear, it is unmistakeably one of the most
 important problems with which the physiologist has to deal, to
 make himself as thoroughly acquainted as it is possible for him
 to be with the budget of the object of his examination. The
 wear and tear consists in the amount of matter consumed; the
 work done is the evolution of heat. This latter effect, however,
 is of two kinds, inasmuch as the animal body evolves heat on
 the one hand directly in its own interior, and distributes it by
 communication to the objects immediately surrounding it; while,
 on the other hand, it possesses, through its organs of motion,
 the power of producing heat mechanically by friction or in
 similar ways, even at distant points. We now require to know

     Whether the heat directly evolved is ALONE to be laid to the
 account of the process of combustion, or whether it is the SUM of
 the heat evolved both directly and indirectly that is to be taken into
 calculation.
    This is a question that touches the very foundations of science ;
 and unless it receives a trustworthy answer, the healthy develop
 ment of the doctrine concerned is not possible. For it has been
 already shown, by various examples, what are the consequences
 of neglecting primary quantitative determinations. No wit of
 man is able to furnish a substitute for what nature offers.
    The physiological theory of combustion starts from the funda
 mental proposition, that the quantity of heat which results from
 the combustion of a given substance is invariable-—that is, that
 its amount is ynin<U+FB02>uenced by the circumstances which accompany
 the combustion; whence we infer, “in specie,” that the chemi
 cal effect of combustible matter can undergo no alteration in
 amount even by the vital process, or that the living organism,
 with ,all its riddles and marvels, cannot create heat out of
 nothing.
    But if we hold <U+FB01>rm to this physiological axiom, the answer to
 the question started above is already given. For, unless we wish
 to attribute again to the organism the power of creating heat
 which has just been denied to it, it cannot be assumed that
 the heat which it produces can ever amount to more than the
 chemical action which takes place. On the combustion-theory
 there is, then, no alternative, short of sacri<U+FB01>cing the theory itself,
 but to admit that the total amount of heat evolved by the
 organism, partly directly, and partly indirectly by mechanical
 action, corresponds quantitatively or is equal to the amount of
 combustion.                 '
    Hence it follows, no less inevitably, that the heat produced
mechanically by the organism must hear an invariable quantitative
relation to the work expended in producing it.
    For if, according to the varying construction of the mecha
nical arrangements which serve for the development of the heat,
the same amount of work, and hence the same amount of organic
combustion, could produce varying quantities of heat, the quan
tity of heat produced from one and the same expenditure of
material would come out smaller at one time and larger at
another, which is contrary to our assumption.          Further, inas
much as there is no difference in kind between the mechanical
performances of the animal body and those of other inorganic
sources of work, it follows that
   AN INVARIABLE QUANTITATIVE RELATION BETWEEN HEAT AND
WORK Is A POSTULATE or THE PHYSIOLOGICAL THEORY or COM
BUSTION.

      Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.             501
    While following in general the direction indicated, it was
accordingly needful for me in the end to <U+FB01>x my attention chie<U+FB02>y
on the physical connexion subsisting between motion and heat;
and it was thus impossible for the existence of the mechanical
equivalent of heat to remain hidden from me. But, although I
have to thank an accident for this discovery, it is none the less
my own, and I do not hesitate to assert my right of priority.
    In order to ensure what had been thus discovered against
casualties, I put together the most important points in a short
paper which I sent in the spring of 1842 to Liebig, with a
request that he would insert it in the Amuilen der Chemie und
Pharmacie, in the forty-second volume of which, page 233, it
may be found under the title “Bemerkungen <U+FB01>ber die Krafte
der unbelebten Natur”*.
    It was a fortunate circumstance for me that the reception
 given to my unpretending work by this man, gifted with so deep
 an insight, at once secured for it an entrance into one of the <U+FB01>rst
 scienti<U+FB01>c organs, and I seize this opportunity of publicly testi
 fying to the great naturalist my gratitude and my esteem.
    Liebig himself, however, had about the same time already
 pointed out, in more general but still unmistakeable terms, the
 connexion subsisting between heat and work. In particular, he
 asserts that the heat produced mechanically by a steam-engine
 is to be attributed solely to the effect of combustion, which can
 never receive any increase through the fact of its producing
 mechanical effects, and, through these, again developing heat.
     From these, and from similar expressions of other scienti<U+FB01>c
 men, we may infer that science has recently entered upon a
 direction in which the existence of the mechanical equivalent of
 heat could not in any case have remained longer unperceived.
     In the paper to which reference has been made, the natural
 law with which we are now concerned is referred back to a few
 fundamental conceptions of the human mind. The proposition
 that a magnitude, which does not spring from nothing, cannot be
 annihilated, is so simple and clear that no valid argument can
 be urged against its truth, any more than against an axiom of
 geometry; and until the contrary is proved by some fact esta
 blished beyond a doubt, we may accept it as true.
     Now we are taught by experience, that neither motion nor
  heat ever takes its rise except at the expense of some measur
  able object, and that in innumerable cases motion disappearswith
  out anything except heat making its appearance. The axiom
     [* A translation of this paper appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for
 November last (see vol. xxiv. p. 371). In this translation are embodied
 the corrections of several misprints in the original, given by the author
 in a foot-note inserted at this point of the present paper.—G. C. F.] _

that we have established leads, then, now to the conclusion that
the motion that disappears becomes heat, or, in other words,
that both objects bear to each other an invariable quantitative
relation. The proof of this conclusion by the method of experi
ment, the establishment of it in all its details, the tracing of a
complete harmony subsisting between the laws of thought and
the objective world, is the most interesting, but at the same
time the most comprehensive problem that it is possible to find.
What I, with feeble powers and without any external support or
encouragement, have effected in this direction is truly little
enough ; but—-ultra posse nemo obligatus.
   In the paper referred to (vol. xxiv. p. 375)I have thus expressed
myself with regard to the genetic connexion of heat and moving
force :-—
   “If it be now considered as established that in many cases
-(exceptio con<U+FB01>rmat regulam) no other effect of motion can be
traced except heat, and that no other cause than motion can he
found for the heat that is produced, we prefer the assumption
that heat proceeds from motion, to the assumption of a cause
without effect and of an effect without a cause,—just as the
chemist, instead of allowing oxygen and hydrogen to disappear
without further investigation, and water to be produced in some
inexplicable manner, establishes a connexion between oxygen
and hydrogen on the one hand and water on the other.”
   From this point there is but one step to be made to the goal.
At page 376 it is said: “The solution of the equations subsist
ing between falling-force [that is, the raising of weight] and
motion requires that the space fallen through in a given time,
e. g. the <U+FB01>rst second, should be experimentally determined; in
like manner, the solution of the equations subsisting between
falling-force and motion on the one hand and heat on the other,
requires an answer to the question, How great is the quantity
of heat which corresponds to a given quantity of motion or falling
force? For instance, we must ascertain how high a given weight
requires to be raised above the ground in order that its falling
force may be equivalent to the raising of the temperature of an
equal weight of water from 0° to 1° C. The attempt to show
that such an equation is the expression of a physical truth may
be regarded as the substance of the foregoing remarks.
    “ By applying the principles that have been set forth to the
relations subsisting between the temperature and the volume of
gases, we <U+FB01>nd that the sinking of a mercury column by which a
gas is compressed is equivalent to the quantity of heat set free
by the compression; and hence it follows, the ratio between the
capacity for heat of air under constant pressure and its capacity
under constant volume being taken as =1'42~1, that the warm

    Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mech_anical Equivalent of Heat.       503
ing of a given weight of water from 0° to 1° C. corresponds
to the fall of an equal weight from the height of about 365
metres.”
   It is plain that the expression “equivalent” is here used in
quite a different sense from what it bears in chemistry. The
difference will be shown most distinctly by an example. When
the same weight of potash is neutralized, <U+FB01>rst, with sulphuric
acid, then with nitric acid, the numbers which express the ratio
which the absolute weights of these three substances bear to one
another are called their equivalents ; but there is no thought here
either of the quantitative equality or of the transformation of
the bodies in question.
    This peculiar signi<U+FB01>cation which the word “equivalent” has
acquired in chemistry, is doubtless connected with the fact
that the chemist has been able to determine the object of his
investigation by a common quantitative standard, their abso
lute weights. Let us suppose, however, that we could determine
one body, for instance water, only by weight, and another, water
forming or explosive gas, only by volume, and that we had
agreed to choose 1 lb. as the unit of weight, and 1 cubic foot as
 the unit of volume ; we should then have to ascertain how many
 cubic feet of explosive gas could be obtained from one pound of
 water, and conversely. This number, without which neither the
 formation nor the decomposition of water could be made the
 subject of calculation, might then be suitably called “the explo
 sive-gas equivalent of water.”
    In this latter sense a raised weight might, in accordance with
 the known laws of mechanics, be called the “equivalent” of the
 motion resulting from its fall. Now, in order to compare these
 two objects, the raised and the moving weight, which admit of
no common measure, we require that constant number which is
 generally denoted by g. This number, however, and the mecha
 nical equivalent of heat, whereby the relation subsisting between
 heat and motion is de<U+FB01>ned, belong both of them to one and the
 same category of ideas.
    In the paper that I have mentioned it is further shown how we
 may arrive at such a conception of force as admits of being con
 sistently followed to its consequences and is scienti<U+FB01>cally tenable ;
 and the importance of this subject induces me to return to it
 again here.
    The word “ force” (Kraft) is used in the higher or scienti<U+FB01>c
 mechanics in two distinct senses.
    I. On the one hand, it denotes every push or pull, every effort
 of an inert body to change its state of rest or of motion; and
 this effort, when it is considered alone and apart from the result
 produced, is called “pushing force,” “pulling force,” or shortly _

 504    Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
 “force,” and also, in order to distinguish between this and the
 following conception, “ dead force ” (vis mortua).
    II. On the other hand, the product of the pressure into the
 space through which it acts, or, again, the product—or half-pro
 duct—of the mass into the square of the velocity, is named
 “force.” In order that motion may actually occur, it is in fact
 necessary that the mass, whatever it may be, should under the
 in<U+FB02>uence of a pressure, and, in the direction of that pressure,
 traverse a certain space, “ the effective space” (Wirkungsraum) :
 and in this case a magnitude which is proportional to the “ push
 ing force” and to the effective space, likewise receives the name
 “force ;” but to distinguish it from the mere pushing force, by
 which alone motion is never actually brought about, it is also
 called the “ vis viva of motion,” or “ moving force.”
    With the generic conception of “force,” the higher mechanics,
 as an essentially analytic science, is not concerned. In order
 to arrive at it, we must, according to the general rule, collect
 together the characters possessed in common by the several
 species.   As is well known, the de<U+FB01>nition so obtained runs thus—
 “ Force is everything which brings about or tends to bring about,
 alters or tends to alter motion.”
    This de<U+FB01>nition, however, it is easy to see, is tautological ; for
 the last fourteen words of it might be omitted, and the sense
would be still the same.
    This erroneous solution is occasioned by the nature of the
 problem, which requires an impossibility. Mere pressure (dead
 force) and the product of the pressure into the effective space
 (living force) are magnitudes too thoroughly unlike to be by pos
sibility combined into a generic conception. Pressure or attrac
tion is, in the theory of motion, what affinity is in chemistry—
an abstract conception: living force, like matter, is concrete;
and these two kinds of force, however closely connected in the
region of the association of ideas, are in reality so widely sepa
rated that a frame which should take them both in must be able
to include the whole world.
    There are several conceivable ways of escaping from the di<U+FB01>i
culty. For instance, just as we speak of absolute weight, speci<U+FB01>c
weight, and combining weight, without its ever entering any
one’s head to want to construct a generic idea out of these
distinct notions, so two or more meanings may be attached to the
word force. This is what is actually done in the higher mecha
nics, and hence in this branch of science we meet with no men
tion of a generic conception of “force.”
   There has been no lack of recommendations to carry, in like
manner, the notions of “dead” and “living force” as distinct
and separate through the other departments of science; it has,

     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.        505
however, been found impossible to put in practice such recom
 mendations; for the use of ambiguous expressions, which can
 in no case contribute anything to clearness, is altogether inad
 missible if confusion can possibly arise. It is true that the
mathematician is in no danger of confounding in his calcula
 tions a product with one of its factors ; but in other departments
 of knowledge a systematic confusion of ideas exists on this point ;
 and if anything is to be done towards clearing it up, the source
 of the error must be stopped; for if we once recognize two mean
 ings of the word “ force,” it would be the labour of Sisyphus to
 try to distinguish between them in each separate case. In order,
 then, to arrive at any result, we must make up our minds to do
 without any common denomination of the magnitudes mentioned
 above as I. and II., and either to give up the use of the word
 “force” altogether, or to employ it for one only of these two
categories.
    The notion of force was consistently employed in the latter
 sense by Newton. In solving his problems, he decomposes the
product of the attraction into the effective space .into its two
factors, and calls the former by the name “force.”
    As an objection to this mode of proceeding, it must, however,
be remarked that in many cases it is not possible thus to decom
pose the product in question. Let us take, for instance, the
following very simple case: a mass M, originally at rest, is
 caused to move with the (uniform <U+FB01>nal) velocity c; from the
knowledge of the magnitudes M and c it is certainly possible to
 deduce thevalueof the product of the f0rce(in Newton’s sense) into
 its effective space, but we are not thereby enabled to conclude
 as to the magnitude of this force itself.
    As a matter of fact, the necessity soon made itself felt of treat
ing and naming this product as awhole.         It also has been called
“force,” and the expressions “vis viva of motion,” “moving
force,” “working force,” “horse-power” (or force), “muscular
force,” &c. have been long naturalized in science.
    However happy we may, in many respects, think the choice of
this word, there is still the objection that a new meaning has been
<U+FB01>xed upon an already existing technical expression, without the old
one having been called in from circulation at the same time. This
formal error has become a Pandora’s box, whence has sprung a
Babylonian confusion of tongues.
    Under existing circumstances no choice is left us but to with
draw the term “force” either from Newton’s dead force or from
Leibnitz’s living force; but in either case we come into con<U+FB02>ict
with prevailing usage. But if once we have made up our minds
to introduce into our science a logically accurate use of terms,
even at the cost of existing expressions which have become easy

506     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.
and pleasant to us by long usage, we cannot long hesitate in the
choice we have to make between the conceptions I. and II.
   Let us consider the elementary case of a mass, originally at
rest, which receives motion: this happens, as has been already
said, by the mass being subjected to a certain push or pull under
the influence of which it traverses a certain space, the effective
space. Now, however, both the velocity and also the intensity
of the push (Newt0n’s force) always vary at every point of the
effective space; and in order to multiply these variable magni
tudes into the effective space, that is, to deduce the quantity of
motion from the intensity of the pushing force, we must call in
the aid of the higher mathematics.
   But hence it follow that, except in statics, where the effec
tive space is nought and the pressure constant, the Newtonian
conception of force is available only in the higher branches of
mechanics ; and it is plainly not advisable so to choose our con
ception of “force ” that it cannot be consistently employed in
that branch (namely the elementary parts of the theory of motion)
which of all others is chie<U+FB02>y concerned with fundamental notions.
   It is, however, a totally mistaken method to try to adapt the
idea of a. force, such as gravity, conceived in Newton’s sense, to
the elementary parts of science, by leaving out of consideration
one of its most important properties, namely its dependence on
distance, and to make a “force” out of G-alileo’s gravity thus
inexactly and in some relations most incorrectly conceived. Some
such ideal force (No. III.) seems to hover before the minds of
most writers on natural science as the original type of a “ force of
nature.”
   Such quantitative determinations as hold good only approxi
mately and under certain conditions ought never to be employed
to establish de<U+FB01>nitions. In a calculation, it is true, we may cor
rectly enough take an are, which is suf<U+FB01>ciently small in com
parison with the radius, as equal to the sine or to the tangent;
but if we attempted to use such a relation in settling <U+FB01>rst prin
ciples, we should lay a foundation for fallacies and errors.
   The Newtonian idea of force, however, transplanted in the
manner that is commonly done into the region of elementary
science, is no whit better than the notion of a straight curve.
Newton’s force, or attraction, in specie gravity, 9, is equal to the
                                                                 dc
differential quotient of the velocity by the time; that is, _g=
                                        _                         dt'
This expression is quite exact, but in order to understand and
apply it a knowledge of the higher mathematics is required. On
the other hand, it is quite true that, so long as we have to do
only with cases in which the space fallen through is so small in
comparison with the earth’s semidiameter that it may be disre

    Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.        507
garded, the equation just given may be abbreviated into the
                              0
very convenient form g=-t without any considerable error; but
this expression can never be mathematically exact so long as the
space fallen through has any calculable magnitude. But on
 the strength of an equation thus radically inaccurate, there are
 planted in the receptive mind of youth such false notions as,——
 that gravity is a uniformly accelerating        force, a moving
 force whose action is proportional to the time ; that force is
 directly proportional (B) to the velocity produced; and many
 other like errors.
      It would certainly be a great merit if authors of treatises on
 physics would help to remedy this state of things, and in fra
  ming their de<U+FB01>nitions would start only from thoroughly exact
  determinations of magnitudes; for elementary physics in its
  present form, instead of being a well-grounded science, is only
  a sort of half-knowledge, such that on passing to the higher and
  strictly scienti<U+FB01>c departments the student must try to forget its
  principles and theorems as quickly as he can.
      If we have once convinced ourselves by unprejudiced exami
- nation that the retention, under that name, of the conception of
  force distinguished above by I. has nothing but its origin to
  recommend it, but much to condemn it, the rest follows almost
  spontaneously. It accords with the laws of thought, as well as
  with the common usage of language, to connect every produc
  tion of motion with an expenditure of force. Hence “force ” is—
       Something which is expended in producing motion; and this
   something which is expended is to be looked upon as a cause
   equivalent to the effect, namely, to the motion produced.
       This de<U+FB01>nition not only corresponds perfectly with facts, but
   it accords as far as possible with that which already exists ; for,
   as I shall show, it contains by implication the conception of
  force as met with in the higher mechanics, and referred to above
   bylfII.a mass M, originally at rest, while traversing the effective
   space s, under the influence and in the direction of the pressure
  p, acquires the velocity c, we have ps=lVlc2.       Since, however,
   every production of motion implies the existence of apressure
    (or of a pull) and an effective space, and also the exhaustion of
   one at least of these factors, the effective space, it follows that
   motion can never come into existence except at the cost of this
   product, ps=Mc'l. And this it is which for shortness I call
   “force.”
       The connexion between expenditure and performance (in other
   words, the exhaustion of force in producing its effect) presents
   itself in the simplest form in the phenomena of gravitation.   The

  508     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.
  necessary condition of every falling motion is that the centre of
  gravity of the two masses concerned in it (that is, of the earth
  and of the falling weight) should approach each other. But in
 the case of the falling together of the two masses, the approach
 of their centres of gravity reaches its natural limit, and hence
  the production of a falling movement is thus bound up with an
 expenditure, namely, with the exhaustion of the given falling
 spacc, and thereby also of the product of that space into the
 attraction. The falling down of a weight upon the earth is a
 process of mechanical combination; and just as in combustion
 the capacity of performance (that is, the condition of the deve
 lopment of heat) ceases when the act of combination comes to an
 end, so also the production of motion ceases when the weight
 has fallen to its lowest position. The weight, when lying on the
 solid ground, is, like the carbonic acid formed in combustion,
 nothing but a caput mortuum.       The af<U+FB01>nity, whether mechanical
 or chemical, is still there after the union just as much as before,
and opposes a certain resistance to the reduction of the compound;
but its power of performance (Leistungsfiihig/ceit) is at an end as
soon as there is no further available falling-space.
     Whenever the attraction becomes inde<U+FB01>nitely small, or ceases .
 altogether, space is no longer effective space ; and thus it follows,
 from the diminution which gravity undergoes with distance, that
 falling-space is limited in the centrifugal direction also, and hence
 that the cause of motion or “ force” is, under all circumstances,
 a <U+FB01>nite magnitude which becomes exhausted in producing its
effect.
    This fundamental physical truth will be most easily perceived
when applied to a special case and reduced to <U+FB01>gures. When a
pound weight is lifted one foot from the ground, the available force
is, as every one knows, =1 foot-pound. If the falling-height of
this weight amounts to n feet, n not being a large number, the
force may be taken as approximately =n foot-pounds. But sup
posing n, or the original distance of the weight from the earth, to
be very considerable, or indeed in<U+FB01>nite, the force (that is, the num
ber of foot-pounds) does not by any means thereby become in<U+FB01>
nite, but, according to Newton’s law of gravitation, it becomes
at most =r foot-pounds, whereris the number of feet contained
in the earth’s semidiameter. Thus how great soever the distance
through which a weight falls against the earth, or the time
occupied by its fall may be, it can acquire no higher <U+FB01>nal velo
city than 34,450 Paris feet per second. On the other hand,
were the mass of the earth four times as great as it is, its bulk
remaining the same, the force would likewise become four times
as great, and the maximum velocity would be 68,900 feet.
    It is one of the essentials of a good terminology that it should

   -‘Dr. J. R. Mayer on t/ie Mechanical Equivalenl ofHeal. 509
put fundamental facts of this kind in a clear light; exactly the
opposite, however, is done by the nomenclature at present in use.
A few expressions, employed by a very meritorious naturalist in
combating my views, may serve to-support this assertion.
   “Although,” he says, “it is quite true that in nature no
motion can be annihilated, or that, as it is commonly expressed,
the quantity of motion once in existence continues unceasingly
and without any lessening, and although in this sense the cha
racter of indestructibility belongs to every proximate cause even,
everyprimarycause, that is, everytrue physical force, possesses the
additional characteristic of being inexhaustible. These charac
teristics will best admit of being unfolded by the closer conside
ration of gravity, the most active and widely diffused of the
natural forces (primary causes), which, as it were the soul of the
world,i11destructibly and inexhaustibly upholds the life of those
great masses on whose motions depends the order of the universe,
while requiring no food from without to call forth its ever renewed
activity.”
   If these words are intended to contain a material contradic
tion of the views I have put forward, they must be meant to
imply that, by virtue of its being inexhaustible, the attractive
power of the earth must be capable of imparting to a falling
weight, under certain conceivable circumstances, an in<U+FB01>nite velo
city. But our author himself in several places lets us see that
he has a (quite well-founded) mistrust of any so decided a con
clusion : this is shown in the following, among other passages :—
“ If we follow up the chain of causes and effects to its <U+FB01>rst
beginnings, we come at length to the true forces of nature, to
those primary causes whose activity does not require that they
should be preceded by any others, which ask for no nourishment,
but which can ever call forth new motions, as it were, out of an
inexhaustible soil, and can uphold and quicken those that are
already in being.”
   Again: “If the moon every moment falls, at least virtually, a.
certain distance towards the earth, what is the force which the
next moment pulls it away again, as it were, in order to give rise
to a new falling force? It is precisely its indestructibility and
inexhaustibility, its power at all times and under all circumstances
to bring about without ceasing, at least virtually, the same effects,

   This “ as it were” and “ at least virtually,” which always
slips in at the critical moment, affords room for the suspicion
that our author is himself not quite con<U+FB01>dent of the power of his
“true natural causes” to give rise to an inexhaustible amount
of motion (of actual exertion of force) ; and the inde<U+FB01>niteness of
these expressions is quite characteristic of the Protean part which

  the force of gravity plays in writings on natural science. The
  most arbitrary explanations are given of this word, and then,
  when facts no longer admit of anything else, a retreat is sought
  in the Newtonian conception.
      Gravity being called a force, and at the same time the term force
  being connected, in accordance with the common use of language,
  with the conception of an object capable of producing motion,
  leads to the false assumption that a mechanical effect (the pro
  duction of motion) can be produced without a corresponding
  expenditure of a measurable object; and here is likewise plainly
  the reason why our author could neither keep clear in his facts
  nor consistent in his reasoning. If once the production of motion
  out of nothing is granted, the annihilation of motion must also
  be admitted as a consequence; and the magnitude of motion
  must, in accordance with this assumption, be simply propor
  tional to the velocity, or =Mc, and the “quantity of motion
  once in existence” must be = +Mc—-Mc=0.                But notwith
   standing his “inexhaustible forces,” the writer referred to
  expressly declares that motion is indestructible; but, instead
  of stating his opinion as to what becomes of motion which dis
  appears by friction, he saysin another place again that it remains
   “ undecided ” whether the effect of a force (the amount of motion
   produced by it) is measured by the <U+FB01>rst or by the second power
   of the velocity (that is, whether it is or is not destructible): he
   even appears, from repeated expressions, to hold it possible that
  .a given quantity of heat can produce motion in in<U+FB01>nituml If
   such were the case, it would certainly be useless to consider the
   convertibility of these magnitudes : the ground would rather have
  been won for the contact theory.
      The polemics of my respected critic, whom I have here intro
   duced as the representative and spokesman of prevailing views,
   and to whom I feel that my sincere thanks are due for his atten
   tive examination of my <U+FB01>rst publication, appear to me to be
_ necessarily without result, inasmuch as the <U+FB01>rst problem in com
   bating my assertions, which all revolve about the one point of an
   invariable quantitative relation between heat and motion, must
   be to <U+FB01>nd out that this relation is variable, and in what cases.
   Formal controversy without a material basis is only beating the
  air; and as to what relates specially to the questions about
  ‘force, the <U+FB01>rst point to consider is, not what sort of thing a
   “force” is, but to what thing we shall give the name “force.”
   Backwards and forwards talk about gravity is fruitless, since all
  _who understand the matter are agreed as to its nature ; for gra
   vity is and remains a differential quotient of the velocity by the
 '_,time, directly proportional to the attracting mass, and inversely
 proportional to the square of the distance: on this point a <U+FB01>nal

decision was come to long ago.        Butwhether it is expedient to
call this magnitude :1 force is quite another question. »             '
    Since, whenever an innovation of essential importance is pro
posed, the public is so ready to misapprehend, I will here state
once more, as clearly as I can, my reasons for saying that “the
force of gravity” is an improper expression.
    It is an unassailable truth that the production of every falling
motion is connected with a corresponding expenditure of a mea
surable magnitude.       This magnitude, if it is to be made an
object of scienti<U+FB01>c investigation (and why should it not 1’), must
have a name given to it; and in accordance with the logical
instinct of man, as manifested in the genius of language, no
other name can be here chosen than the word “force.” But
since this expression is already used in a quite different sense,
we might be tempted to create for the conception which is as yet
 —in the fundamental parts of science at least—unnamed an»
 entirely new name. But before betaking ourselves to this extreme
 course, which for reasons that are not far to seek would be the
 one whereby we should be brought most into con<U+FB02>ict with exist
 ing usage, it is reasonable to inquire whether the word “force,”
 which in itself answers so well to the requirements of the case,
is in its right place where it was <U+FB01>rst put by the schools.
    According to the common custom of speech, we understand
 by “ force ” something moving—-a cause of motion; and if, on
 the one hand, the expression “moving force” is for this reason,
 strictly speaking, a pleonasm, the notion of a not moving or
 “ dead ” force is, on the other hand, a contradictio in azijecto.
 If it be said, for instance, that a load which presses with its
 weight on the ground exerts thereby a force-—a force which,
 though never so great, is unable of itself to bring about the
 smallest movement-— the mode of conception and of expression
 is quite justified by scholastic usage, but it is so far-fetched that
 it becomes the source of unnumbered misapprehensions.
     Between gravity and the force of gravity there is, so far as I
 KIIOW, no difference ; and hence I consider the second expression
 unscienti<U+FB01>c, inasmuch as it is tautological.
     Let it not be objected that the “force” of pressure, the “force”
 of gravity, cohesive “force,” &c. are the higher causes of pres
 sure, gravity, and the like. The exact sciences are concerned
 with phenomena and measurable quantities. The <U+FB01>rst cause of
 things is Deity—a Being ever inscrutable by the intellect of
  man; while “higher causes,” “supersensuous forces,” and the
  rest, with all their consequences, belong to the delusive middle _,
 region of naturalistic philosophy and mysticism.
     By a law that is universally true, waste and want go hand in_
  hand. If to the case before us, where this rule likewise meets;

  with con<U+FB01>rmation, we apply an equalizing process, and take away
  the word “force” from the connexion in which it is super<U+FB02>uous
  and hurtful, and bring it to where we are in want of it, we get
  rid at one time of two important obstacles. The higher mathe
  matics at once cease to be required in order to gain admittance
  into the theory of motion: nature presents herself in simple
  beauty before the astonished eye, and even the less gifted may
  now behold many things which hitherto were concealed from
  the most learned philosophers.
     Force and matter are indestructible objects. This law, to
  which individual facts may most simply be referred, and which
  therefore I might <U+FB01>guratively call the heliocentric stand-point,
  constitutes a natural basis for physics, chemistry, physiology,
  and philosophy.
     Among the facts which, though known, have been hitherto
  only empirically established and have remained isolated, but
  which can be easily referred to this natural law, is the one that
  electric and magnetic attraction cannot be isolated any more than
  gravity, or that the strength of this attraction undergoes no
  alteration, so long as the distance remains the same, by the in
  tervening of indifferent substances (non-conductors).
     Among facts which have remained unknown up to the most
  recent times, I will refer only to the in<U+FB02>uence which the ebb and
 <U+FB02>ow of the tide exerts, in accordance with the known laws of
 mechanics, on the motion of the earth about its axis. A fact of
 such importance, standing, as it does, in close relation with the
 fundamental law just stated, having been able to escape the atten
 tion of naturalists, is of itself a proof that the prevailing system
 has no exclusive title.
     For the rest, it will not have escaped those who are acquainted
 with the modern literature of science that a modi<U+FB01>cation of scien
 ti<U+FB01>c language in the sense of my views is actually beginning to
 take place. But in matters of this kind the chief part of the
 work must be left to time.
     According to what has been said thus far, the vis viva of mo
 tion must be called a force. But since the expression vis viva
 denotes in mechanics, not only a magnitude which is propor
 tional to the mass and to the square of its velocity, but also one
 which is proportional to the mass and to the height from which .
 it has fallen, force thus conceived naturally divides itself into two
 very easily distinguished species, each of which requires a distinct
 technical name, for which the words motion (Bewegung) and
falling-force (Fall/craft) seem to me the most appropriate*.
    [* The distinction here drawn between “motion ” and “falling force ” is
the same as that made by Helmholtz (Die Erhaltung der Kraft, 1847) be
tween “ vis viva” (lebendige Kraft) and “ tension ” (Spankraft). The En

      Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.               513
     Hence, according to this de<U+FB01>nition, “motion” is always mea
  sured by the product of the moved mass into the square of the
  velocity, never by the product of the mass into the velocity.
     By “falling-force” we understand a raised weight, or still
  more generally, a distance in space between two ponderable
  bodies. In many cases falling-force is measured with su<U+FB01>icient
 accuracy by the product of the raised weight into its height;
 and the expressions “foot-pound,” “kilogramme-metre,” “horse
 power,” and many others, are conventional units for the mea
 surement of this force, which have of late come into general use,
 especially in practical mechanics. But in order to <U+FB01>nd the exact
 quantitative expression for the magnitude in question, we must
 consider (at least) two masses existing at a determinate distance
 from each other, which acquire motion by mutually approaching;
 and we must investigate the relation which exists between the
 conditions of the motion, namely, the magnitude of the masses
 and their original and <U+FB01>nal distance, and the amount of motion
 produced.
    It very remarkably happens that this relation is the simplest
 conceivable ; for, according to Newton’s law of gravitation, the
 quantity of motion produced is directly proportional to the masses
 and to the space through which they fall, but inversely propor
 tional to the distances of the centres of gravity of the masses
 before and after the movement. That is, if A and B are the two
 masses, 0 and c’ the velocities which they respectively acquire,
 and h and h' their original and <U+FB01>nal distances apart, we have
                      Ae+Ba2= A.B(h—h')   h.h'

                                                    ’
 or in words, the falling-force is equal to the product of the masses
 into the space fallen through divided by the two distances.
    By help of this theorem, which, as will be easily seen, is
nothing but a more general and convenient expression of New
glish expressions “ dynamical energy ” and “ statical energy ” were used by
Prof. W. Thomson (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. iv. p. 304, 1852) in the same sense,
but were afterwards abandoned by him in favour of the terms “actual energy”
am “ potential eneigy ” introduced by Prof. Rankine. More recently
(‘ Good Words ’ for    ctober 1862) Professors Thomson and Tait have em
ployed the expression “kinetic energy ” in place of “ actual energy.”   The
German word Kraft in the text has been uniformly translated force, to which
term the ambiguity of the German original has thus been transferred. This
ambiguity, however, may be avoided in English by allowing the word
“force ” to retain the meaning which it bears in common language, that is,
to denote all resistances which it requires the exertion of a power to over
come (whence the expressions gravitating force, cohesive force, &c.), and      _

    'ton's law of gravitation*, the laws of the fall of bodies from cos
     mical elevations, and also the general laws of central motions,
     can be developed without its being needful to employ equations
     of more than the second degree.
        Having now become acquainted with two species of force
     motion and falling forcc—we can arrive at a conception of “a
     force” in general, according to the well-known rule, by collect
     ing together the common characteristics of the two species.                To
     this end, we must consider the properties of these objects some
     what more closely. Their most important property depends on
     their mutual relation. Whenever a given quantity of falling
     force disappears, motion is produced; and by the expenditure of
     this latter, the falling force can be reproduced in its original
     amount.
         This constant proportion which exists between falling-force
     and motion, and is known in the higher mechanics under the
     name of “the principle of the conservation of vis viva,” may be
     shortly and <U+FB01>tly denoted by the term “transformation” (Um
     wandlung). For instance, we may say that a planet, in passing
     from its aphelion to its perihelion, transforms a part of its falling
     force into motion, and, as it moves away from the sun again,
     changes a part of its motion into falling force. In using the
     word “transform” in this sense, nothing else can or is intended
     to be expressed but a constant numerical ratio.
         But it follows from the axiom mentioned at page 500, that
     the production of a de<U+FB01>nite quantity of motion from a given
     quantity of falling-force, and vice vcrsci, implies that neither fall
     ing-force nor motion can be annihilated either totally or in part.
      We thus obtain the following de<U+FB01>nition :—
         Forces are transformable, indestructible, and (in c0ntradistinc
     tion from matter) impomlerable objects. (Conf. paper already
     quoted, p. 502.)
         It is easy to see that this de<U+FB01>nition embraces, among other
     things, the fact that the motion which disappears in mechanical
      processes of different kinds bears a constant relation to the heat
     thereby produced, or that motion is convertible, as an indestruc
      tible magnitude, into heat. Thus heat is, like motion, a force;
     and motion, like heat, an imponderable.
         I have characterized the relation which various forces bear to
        ‘ Newton’s formula relates to the particular case in which the two di
      stances (the initial and the <U+FB01>nal distance) are equal, so that their product
      becomes a square.     In this case, however, both the space fallen through
      and the velocity become nought; and hence, when this expression has to
      be taken as the starting-point for the calculation of real velocities, mathe
      matical arti<U+FB01>ces become necessary which are inadmissible in the elementary
-.1   branches of science.                         '

 one another by saying (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxiv. p. 872) that
 they are “di<U+FB01>'erent forms under which one and the same object
 makes its appearance.” At the same time I have expressly
 guarded myself from making the certainly plausible, but un
 proved and, as it seems to me, hazardous deduction that thermal
 phenomena are to be regarded as merely phenomena-of motion. ,
 The following is what I said upon this point (lac. cit. p. 376):—
    “ But just as little as the connexion between falling-force and
 motion authorizes the conclusion that the essence of falling-force
 is motion, can such a conclusion be adopted in the case of heat.’
 We are, on the contrary, rather inclined to infer that before it
 can become heat, motion—whether simple, or vibratory as in
 the case of light and radiant heat, &c.——must cease to exist as
 motion.”
    The relation which, as we have seen, subsists between heat and
 motion has regard to quantity, not to quality; for (to borrow the
 words of Euclid) things which are equal to one another are not
 therefore similar. Let us beware of leaving the solid ground of
 the objective, if we would not entangle ourselves in difficulties of
 our own making.                                                  _
    In the mean time it at least results from the foregoing consi
 derations that the phenomena of heat, electricity, and magnetism
 do not owe their existence to any peculiar <U+FB02>uids; and the im
 materiality of heat, asserted half a century ago by Rumford,
becomes, through the discovery of its mechanical equivalent, a
 certainty.                                                    _
    The form of force denoted by the name “ heat ” is plainly not
 single, but includes several distinct, though mutually equivalent,
 objects, three principal forms of which are distinguished in com
 mon language: namely, 1. Radiant Heat; II. Free (sensible),
 Heat, Speci<U+FB01>c Heat; and III. Latent Heat.
    There can he no doubt that radiant heat must be regarded as
 a phenomenon of motion, especially since the recent detection
 of phenomena of interference in the radiation of heat. But‘
 whether there really exists, as is commonly assumed, a peculiar
 aether, of which the vibratory motion is perceived by us as radiant
 heat, or whether the seat of this motion is the particles of mate
rial bodies, is a question that is not yet made out.
    Still greater obscurity hangs about the essential nature of
speci<U+FB01>c heat, or what goes on in the interior of a heated body. "
Not only does the unanswered question of the aether enter again’
here, but, before we can be in a position to form any clear ideas
 on this subject, we require to have an exact knowledge of the
internal constitution of matter.    We are, however, still far from
having reached this point; for, in particular, we do not know
whether such things as atoms exist—,-that is, whether matter‘.-'

  5l6 Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
  consists of such constituents as undergo no further change of
  form in chemical processes.
     But a span of that time which stretches both backwards and
  forwards into eternity is meted out to man here on earth, and
  the space which his foot can tread is narrowly bounded above
  and below: so also his scienti<U+FB01>c- knowledge <U+FB01>nds natural limits
  in the direction of the in<U+FB01>nitely small as well as of the in<U+FB01>nitely
  great. The question of atoms seems to me to lead beyond these
  limits, and hence I consider it unpractical. An atom in itself
  can no more become an object of our investigation than a differ
 ential, notwithstanding that the ratio which such immensely small
 auxiliary magnitudes bear to one another may be represented by
 concrete numbers.      In every case, however, the conception of an
 atom must be regarded as merely relative, and must be considered
 in connexion with some de<U+FB01>nite process; for, as is well known,
 the particles of an acid and base may play the part of atoms in
 the formation and decomposition of a salt, while in another pro
 eess these atoms may themselves undergo further division.
    But assuming that, in a chemical sense, atoms have a real
 existence——an assumption which, among other things, the laws
 of isomorphism certainly render probable—the further question
 arises whether, b the continued division of matter, we can at
 last arrive at mo ecules which are atoms in relation to the phe_
 nomena of heat, such that heat cannot penetrate to their interior,
 and such that, when the whole mass is heated, they for their
 parts undergo no increase of bulk. But since we are unable to
 grapple with such preliminary questions as these, we are forced
 to confess that, whether the existence of an aether and of atoms be
 admitted or not, we are, so far as regards the nature of speci<U+FB01>c
 heat, in a state of ignorance.
    The expression “latent heat” has reference to its correctly
 recognized property of indestructibility. In all cases in which
thcrmometrically sensible speci<U+FB01>c heat disappears, it must be
assumed that it eludes our perception only by taking on some
other state of existence, and that by an appropriate process of
inverse transformation the free heat can be reproduced in its
original amount. These are the facts on which the doctrine of
latent heat rests ; and hence, if we have regard to them only, all
the connected phenomena may be claimed as so many con<U+FB01>rma
tions of the principle of the transformation and conservation of
force.
    The conception of latent heat is accordingly nothing else than
the conception of something equivalent to free heat, and thus
the doctrine of free and speci<U+FB01>c heat embraces pretty nearly the
whole domain of physics. A few examples, chosen from among
the abundance of facts, may serve to show how, according to my

     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.       517
 view, the phenomena wherein heat becomes latent are to be
 regarded.
    If heat is communicated to a gas retained under constant
 pressure, the free heat of the gas is increased, and at the same
 time a calculable quantity of heat becomes latent; the gas is
 thereby caused to expand, and there is consequently produced
 an amount of vis viva proportional to the pressure and to the
 space through which expansion takes place. Therefore as soon
 as we know how much of the heat that has become latent is to
 be attributed to the expansion of the gas, we know also the
 amount of the remainder of the latent heat corresponding to the
 vis viva produced. Now Gay-Lussac has proved by experiment
 that the speci<U+FB01>c heat of a gas undergoes no sensible alteration
in <U+FB02>owing from a containing vessel into a vacuum. Hence it
follows that a gaseous body opposes no perceptible resistance to
the separation of its particles, and that the rarefaction of a gas
does not of itself (that is, when it occurs without any evolution
of force) cause any heat to become latent. The total quantity
of heat which becomes latent by the expansion of a gas is there
fore to be taken as the equivalent of the vis viva produced.
    It results from the principle of the indestructibility of heat-—
a principle which no one calls in question—-that the quantity of
heat which has thus become latent must again become free when
heat is in any way produced at the expense of the acquired vis
viva of motion. Motion is latent heat, and heat is latent motion.
    The celebrated law of Dulong, that the amount of heat pro
duced by the compression of a gas is dependent on the amount
of force expended, and not upon the chemical nature, tension, or
temperature of the gas, is a special application of the above
general principle. But in the communication so often men
tioned I have shown that this law of nature is capable of a very
much wider application, and that the heat which becomes latent
in the expansion of a gas reappears again in every case, if the
vis viva thereby produced is employed to generate heat, whether
by the compression of air, by friction, or by the impact of non
elastic bodies; and I have there calculated the mechanical equi
valent of heat upon principles of which the accuracy cannot be
disputed. I also measured at that time, by way of control, the
heat produced in the manufacture of paper in Holland, and
compared it with the working force expended, and so found a
su<U+FB02>icient degree of concordance between the two quantities. I
have recently, moreover,‘ succeeded in constructing, for the pur
pose of the direct determination of the mechanical equivalent of
heat, a very simple thermal dynamometer on a small scale, with
which the truth of the principle in question can be demonstrated
ad oculos; and I have reason to believe that the e<U+FB02>iciency of

 518     Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
 water-wheels and steam-engines might be easily and advan
 tageousl measured by means of a similar calorimotorial appa
 ratus. lt must, however, be left to the future judgment of prac
 tical men to decide whether, and to what extent, this method
deserves to be preferred to Prony's.
     Heat further becomes latent in certain changes of the state of
 aggregation of bodies. Since it is a settled fact that both solid
 and liquid bodies oppose a certain resistance to the separation
 of their parts, and since in general an expenditure of vis viva
 is required for the overcoming of mechanical resistances, we
 are led to conclude a priori that whenever the cohesion of a
 body is diminished or done away with, force or heat must
 become latent; and this, as is well known, perfectly accords
with experience.
    Starting from this point of view, the French physicist Person
 has attempted to detect a direct quantitative relation between
 the latent heat of metals, on which he has made a great number
 of observations, and their cohesion; but at present determina
 tions of this kind are beset with almost insurmountable dif‘<U+FB01>cul
 ties.
    The heat which becomes latent in the evaporation of water has
been considered from quite a similar point of view by Holtzmann
in his important memoir “ On the Heat and Elasticity of Gases
and Vapours.” Starting from the principle that elevation of tem
perature is equivalent to the raising of a weight, this philosopher
has likewise calculated the mechanical equivalent of heat from
the quantity of heat which becomes latent by the expansion of a
gas; and he very rightly conceives of the latent heat of steam as
made up of two parts, whereof one, the smaller, is expended in
overcoming the opposing pressure of the atmosphere, and can
hence be easily calculated by means of the mechanical equivalent
of heat, while the remaining part, the amount of which can also
be calculated, is what Holtzmann calls the heat required to destroy
the cohesion of the water. In all steam-engines this latter por
tion is wasted, and Holtzmann calculates from these data the
superior e<U+FB02>iciency of high-pressure compared with low-pressure
engines*.
    If the view here taken of the latent heat of fusion and evapo
ration is correct, heat must also become latent when hard bodies
are reduced to powder; and when such substances pass into
the liquid condition from a state of <U+FB01>ne division, they must
absorb a smaller quantity of heat than when they are lique<U+FB01>ed

instituted in this direction have not hitherto given any decisive
result.
   It is also worthy of notice that certain solid bodies which are
capable of assuming allotropic states, as, for instance, the oxygen
compounds of iron, evolve a considerable quantity of heat on
passing from a less to a more hard condition. Such facts, the
number of which will doubtless continually increase with time,
agree perfectly with the above principle, that diminution of
cohesion involves an expenditure of heat, and, on the other hand,
increase of cohesion a production of heat.
    Customary language, according to which gravity is called a
moving force and heat a substance, occasions, on the one hand,
the signi<U+FB01>cance of an important natural object, falling-space, or
the space through which a body falls, to be kept as much as
possible out of sight, and, on the other hand, heat to be removed
to the greatest possible distance from the vis viva of motion.
The sciences are thus reduced to an arti<U+FB01>cial system, over whose
<U+FB01>ssured surface we can advance in safety only by the powerful
aid of the higher analysis.
    Without doubt the fact that so simple and obvious a matter
as the connexion between heat and motion could remain unper
 ceived up to the most recent times must also be attributed to the
 same defect. Nevertheless,- as has been already pointed out,
the quantitative determination of chemical heating-effects and
of galvanic actions, as well as researches into vital phenomena,
instituted in the spirit of those of Liebig, must soon have led to
 the law, not di<U+FB02>icult to discover, of the equivalence of heat and
 motion.
    In reality this law and its numerical expression, the mecha
 nical equivalent of heat, were published almost simultaneously
 in Germany and in England.
    Starting from the fact that the amount of chemical as well as
 of galvanic effect is dependent only and solely on the amount
 of material expenditure, the celebrated English physicist Joule
 was led to the principle that the phenomena of motion and of
 heat rest essentially upon one and the same foundation, or, as he
 expressed himself, in the same way as I have done, heat and
 motion are transformable one into the other.
    Not only did this philosopher indisputably make an indepen
 dent discovery of the natural law in question, but to him belongs
 the credit of having made numerous and important contributions
 towards its further establishment and development. Joule has
 shown that when motion is produced by means of electro-mag
 netism, the heating effect of the galvanic current is diminished
 in a corresponding and <U+FB01>xed proportion. He has further ascer

 520    Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat.
 tained that by reversing the poles of a magnetic bar a quantity
 of heat is produced proportional to the square of the magnetic
 tension,-—a fact which was also discovered by myself, though at
 a later date. In particular, Joule has likewise demonstrated, by
 means of numerous experiments, that the heat evolved by friction
 under various circumstances stands in an unvarying proportion
 to the amount of force expended. According to his most recent
 experiments of this kind, he has <U+FB01>xed the mechanical equivalent
 of heat at 423 *.      '
    Joule has likewise investigated experimentally, in relation to
 this question, the thermal behaviour of elastic <U+FB02>uids when
 expanded, and has thereby con<U+FB01>rmed the earlier results of other
 physicists.
    The new subject soon began to excite the attention of learned
men; but inasmuch as both at home and abroad the subject has
been exclusively treated as a foreign discovery, I <U+FB01>nd myself
 compelled to make the claims to which priority entitles me ; for
 although the few investigations which I have given to the public,
 and which have almost disappeared in the <U+FB02>ood of communica
 tions which every day sends forth without leaving a trace behind,
 prove, by the very form of their publication, that I am not one
 who hankers after effect, it is not therefore to be assumed that I
 am willing to be deprived of intellectual property which docu
 mentary evidence proves to be mine.
    By help of the mechanical equivalent of heat many problems
can be solved which, without it, could not be attacked at all:
among them, the calculation of the thermal effect of the falling
together of cosmical masses may be especially mentioned. It
will not be out of place to indicate here brie<U+FB02>y a few results of
such calculations.
   The following is one problem of this kind. It is assumed
that a cosmical body enters the atmosphere of our earth with a
velocity of four geographical miles per second, and that, in con-.
 sequence of the resistance which it here encounters, it loses so
much of its vis viva of motion that its remaining velocity when
it again quits the atmosphere amounts to 3 miles: the question
now arises, How great is the thermal effect which accompanies
this process '3
   A simple calculation, based upon the mechanical equivalent of
heat, shows that the quantity of heat required is about eight
times as great as the heat of combustion of a mass of coal of
equal weight with the body in question, 1 kilogramme of coal
              * That is, 1 thermal unit = 423 kilogrammetresi

    Dr. J. R. Mayer on the Mechanical Equivalent ofHeat.                 521
being taken as yielding 6000 thermal units. Hence it follows
 that the velocity of the motion of shooting~stars and <U+FB01>re-balls,
 which, as is well known, attains, according to astronomical
 observations, to from 4 to 8 miles, is a cause fully su<U+FB02>icient to
 produce the most violent evolution of heat, and an insight into
 the nature of these remarkable phenomena is thereby afforded
 to us*.
    The following is a problem of a similar kind: if two cosmical
 masses, moving in space about their common centre of gravity,
 were by any cause whatever, for example by the resistance of
 the surrounding medium, caused to fall together, the question
 again arises, How great is the thermal effect corresponding to
 this process of mechanical combination?                               '
    Even though the elements of the orbits (that is, their excen
 tricity) may be unknown, we can nevertheless calculate from
 the given weight and volume of the masses in question the
 maximum and the minimum of the required effect. Thus let it
 be supposed, for the sake of an example, that our earth had been
divided into two equal globes which had united in the manner
described: calculation teaches us that the amount of heat
which would have been evolved in such a case would consider
ably exceed that which an equal weight of matter could furnish
by the most intense process of chemical action.
    It is more than probable that the earth has come into existence
 in some such way, and that in consequence our sun, as seen from
 the distance of the <U+FB01>xed sta1's, exhibited at that epoch a transient
 burst of light. But what took place in our solar system perhaps
 millions of years ago, still goes on at the present time here and
there among the <U+FB01>xed stars; and the transient appearance of
 stars, which in some cases, like the celebrated star of Tycho
Brahe, have at <U+FB01>rst an extraordinay degree of brilliance, may be
satisfactorily explained by assuming the falling together of pre
viously invisible double stars.
    Contrasting with such explosive bursts of light is the steady
radiation, shown continuously through enormous periods, by the
greater number of <U+FB01>xed stars, and among them by our sun. Do
these appearances, which in so special a manner tempt to higher
speculations, constitute a real exception to the exhaustion of a
cause in producing its eifect, which, in accordance with the fore
going considerations, we have regarded as an established law of
Nature? or does the small sum of human knowledge authorize
us in supposing that here also there is an equivalence between
   “ The idea that the meteors here referred to owe their light to a mecha
nical process—whether friction, or the compression of the air—is not new ;

        LXVIII. On some Reactions of Hydride of Benzoyle.
               By Aarnun H. Cnuacn, B.A. O.zon.*
              Action of Sodium on Hydride ofBenzoyle.
    T has been observed that when sodium is heated with pure
       hydride of benzoyle, although the metal disappears, there is
no evolution of hydrogen. While recording this phenomenon in
his Traité de C/zimie Organique, Gerhardt, struck by its singu
larity, expressed a doubt as to the accuracy of the observation.
The point evidently required further elucidation, yet the prone
ness of the materials to oxidize and otherwise change rendered
the investigation by no means inviting. However, in pursuing
it, I have been rewarded with several interesting results which I
would now brie<U+FB02>y record.
    Having prepared some hydride of benzoyle in a state of perfect
purity, I determined to bring it into contact with sodium in the
presence of a liquid solvent itself inert. For this purpose I chose
that portion of coal-naphtha which boils between 100° and
 110° C. After having rendered it anhydrous, I dissolved in it a.
 weighed quantity of the hydride (about one-twentieth of the
 naphtha used). Into the solution, contained in a small long
necked <U+FB02>ask with a condensing tube, a clean weighed globule of
 sodium attached to a platinum wire i introduced, and the <U+FB02>ask
 then gently warmed until an action has been set up. Occasion
 ally it becomes necessary to moderate the violence of the change
 by cooling the vessel. No gas whatever is evolved; and when
 the reaction is complete, the globule of fused sodium remains
 bright even when the liquid is long kept boiling, the dark green
 crusts of the new sodium-compounds ceasing to be formed. But
 further experiments showed that this reaction is more completely
 under control when sodium-amalgam is used in place of the
 pure metal : the new body is then obtained in nearly colourless
 gelatinous <U+FB02>akes. In order to determine quantitatively the
 nature of the change, I have weighed in several experiments
 the residual sodium withdrawn from the <U+FB02>ask when cold, and
plunged in a counterpoised vessel of Persian naphtha—the

direct determination in the whole quantity made from a known
weight of benzoic aldehyde. Of the following analyses, the most
accordant of a large number, the two <U+FB01>rst were performed on the
compound as prepared with pure sodium ; the two letter on the
body owing its origin to the action of sodium-amalgam. Although
the <U+FB02>asks were supplied with a slow stream of nitrogen in order
to prevent oxidation during the experiment, yet small quantities
of benzoate of sodium were invariably produced. This formation
explains the large discrepancies in my results, amounting in some
cases to a difference in the percentage of sodium of more than 3
perI.cent.

 for the sodium-compound, which requires 17'83 per cent. of
sodium. This formula is scarcely admissible on several grounds.
 To double it merely would not be to make it more intelligible;
 but I think a reasonable rearrangement of the doubled formula
is suggested by the decomposition which the new sodium-body;
undergoes when treated with water (or acids),—benzoic alcoho
 (hydrate of benzyle or toluenyle), benzoic aldehyde, and hydrate
of sodium being formed, according to the equation

            sodium.                      benzoyle.
   The correctness of these equations is abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed by
every observation hitherto made—such as the amount of sodium
absorbed, the non-evolution of hydrogen either in the action of
sodium on the aldehyde or in the action of water upon the
sodium-compound ; the actual experimental production, as above
mentioned, of (about) 1 equiv. of benzoic alcohol and 1 equiv.
of benzoic aldehyde to 2 equivs. of hydrate of sodium ; but above
all, the nature of the tw_o chief <U+FB01>nal products, benzoic alcohol
and benzoic aldehyde, which may most reasonably be supposed
to owe their origin to the action of water upon their respective
sodium-compounds. It should, however, be here stated that
when sodium is heated with hydride of benzoyle, the action is
occasionally arrested when but half complete: it is dit<U+FB01>cult to
account for the phenomenon, except on the supposition that
benzoyle is formed instead of benzoylide of sodium.
    Since the sodium-compounds do not admit of accurate analysis
or complete separation from one another, I have not only iden
ti<U+FB01>ed the benzoic alcohol and aldehyde which they yield when
treated with water, with the common forms of these substances,
but I have examined the action of hydrochloric acid and of chlo
ride of benzoyle upon them.
   When hydrochloric acid gas is passed through benzole in
which the sodium-compounds are suspended, chloride of tolu
enyle (benzylc) is produced. This liquid, identi<U+FB01>ed by Canniz
zaro* with chlortoluole, boils at 185° C.           It distils over with
some quantity of regenerated oil of bitter almonds. VVhen, in
this experiment, chloride of benzoyle is substituted for hydro
chloric acid, the benzole when distilled o<U+FB02>", after separation of the
chloride of sodium, leaves as a residue a partly crystalline mass
which theoretically should contain benzoyle along with the ben
zoyle-compound of benzoic alcohol—the benzoate of toluenyle,

    According to Gerhardt, hydride of cumyle, when heated with
 potassium, disengages hydrogen, forming cumylide of potas
 sium :—                    -
           2(e">n“o, H)+K’=2(G1°H" 9, K) +11% _
 I have not succeeded in obtaining an identical result. If potas
 sium or sodium and cuminole be heated to the boiling-point of
 the latter substance, a certain quantity of- hydrogen is indeed
 liberated, but far less than the volume demanded by the above
 equation; while this disengagement of gas is attended with a
 more profound and irregular decomposition. This change also
 occurs in the benzoyle series.      When, however, cuminole and
 so(lium~amalgam are brought together, as before described, in
 the presence of naphtha (cymole itself may be used), sodium
 cuminic alcohol and cumylide of sodium are formed in equivalent
 proportions. Water acting upon these compounds on the one
 hand regenerates the original hydride of cumyle, and on the
 other liberates cuminic alcohol

    The cuminic alcohol thus derived is identical with that which
occurs in minute proportion in cumin oil, and which is also
formed arti<U+FB01>cially from cuminole by the action of alcoholic
potash. It boils at 244° C. Besides these two bodies, a some,
what viscid oil occurs in the product of the reaction. This oil
distils over at a high temperature, above 300° C., and is appa
rently identical with Gerhardt’s cumyle. It may be more readily
obtained in another way. VVhen the product of the action of
sodium on cuminole is treated with chloride of cumyle, the
radical is formed, accompanied, however, with cuminate of
cymenyle.     This mode of procedure, accomplished by Gerhardt,
gives therefore a mixed product; and this fact explains one or
two anomalies noticed by that chemist, especially in the action of
chloride of benzoyle upon his so-called “cumylure dc potassium.”
When the above-named bodies are mixed and heated, the change
proceeds to some extent as follows :—

   Two methods of obtaining benzoic alcohol, in addition to the
process given above, have been described. M. Cannizzaro origi
nally prepared this body by the action of alcoholic potash upon
oil of bitter almonds; but M. Friedel* has lately procured it
from the same substance by the simultaneous action of water
and sodium (sodium-amalgam).              These somewhat analogous
reactions may be thus formulated :—

   Into an intimate mixture of 10 parts of pure hydride of hen

being repeatedly shaken with gradual addition of 2 more parts
of water. The <U+FB02>ask in which the experiment is made, after the
addition of some more sodium-amalgam, should be connected
with an apparatus from which hydrogen is being disengaged, and
then set aside for ten days or a fortnight, during which time it
should be frequently agitated, on each occasion a few drops of
water being poured in. The reaction being over, the <U+FB02>ask will
 be found to contain an aqueous solution of soda, benzoate of
 sodium, together with a semisolid cake chie<U+FB02>y consisting of
benzoic alcohol and a new white crystalline substance, which
 may either he gradually eliminated from the mass by repeated
 treatments with very dilute boiling alcohol, or be freed from the
 bodies accompanying it by repeated digestions with strong soda
solution. The substance thus puri<U+FB01>ed having been once recry
 stallized from dilute boiling alcohol, is to be washed with water,
 dried at 100° C., washed once with cold absolute ether, and
then twice recrystallized from the same liquid heated to ebulli

  benzole. The presence of benzoic alcohol, of atrace even, renders
   dicresole far more soluble, and prevents its crystallization.
      Dicresole dissolves in sulphuric acid with a deep green colour.
  Ehullition with nitric acid converts dicresole partly into nitro
  benzoic acid, and partly into a yellow nitro-substitution product.
   Heated for some time with strong potash solution, a portion
  appears to dissolve, but without colour, while the larger part of
   the dicresole remains unchanged.
      Dicresole dissolved in naphtha and boiled with potassium
   disengages hydrogen, with the formation of a red compound:
  the reaction is, however, incomplete and unsatisfactory.
      Dicresole melts at or near 129° C., and, on cooling, often
  remains liquid till the thermometer has fallen to 70° C. It boils
  at a very high temperature, and cannot be distilled without par
  tial decomposition.       The sublimed substance is deposited in the

   Dicresole may be distinguished from benzoine, which it re
sembles in some particulars, by its different fusing-point (lO" C.
higher), by the green colour which it produces with sulphuric
acid, and by its indifference to a strong solution of caustic pot
ash.    Benzoine itself, indeed, by the action of sodium-amalgam
and water, is partially hydrogenated, with the production of a
 substance apparently identical with dicresole. .
   I have obtained in the cumyle series a body seemingly homo
logous with dicresole, but the quantity was quite insui<U+FB01>cient for
quantitative analysis. It appears that the method of converting
an aldehyde into its alcohol by the action of sodium-amalgam
upon a solution of the aldehyde in an inert liquid such as bcn- _
zole, followed by treatment of the sodium compounds thus formed
with water, is of very general application. At the same time,
the alteration of the aldehyde consequent upon the presence of a
caustic alkali, as in Friedel’s process, is eliminated by thus divi
 ding the reaction into two stages.
            LXIX. On the Delineation of a Cubic Scrole.
                        By A. CAYLEY, Esq.*
    MAGINE a cubic scrole (skew surface of the third order) ge
      nerated by lines each of which meets two given directrix lines.
 One of these is a nodal (double) line on the surface, and I call it
the nodal directrix; the other is a single line on the surface,
and I call it the single directrix. The section by any plane is a
 cubic passing through the points in which the plane meets the
directrix lines; i. e. the point on the nodal directrix is a node
 (double point) of the curve, the point on the single directrix a
single point on the curve; the two directrix lines, and the cubic
curve, the section by any plane, determine the scrole. Consider
the sections by a series of parallel planes. Let one of these
planes be called the basic plane, and the section by this plane
the basic section or basic cubic; and imagine any other section
projected on the basic plane by lines parallel to the nodal direc
trix: such section may be spoken of simply as ‘the section,’ and
its projection as ‘the cubic.’ The cubic has a node at the node
of the basic cubic; that is, the two curves have at this point four
points in common. The two curves have, moreover, in common
the three points at in<U+FB01>nity (or, in other words, their asymptotes
                  ‘ "‘ Communicated by the Author.

 are parallel); in fact the points at in<U+FB01>nity of ‘either curve are
 the points in which the line at in<U+FB01>nity, the intersection of the
 basic plane and the plane of the section, meets the scrole ; and
 these points are therefore the same for each of the two curves.
 The remaining two points of intersection of the cubic with the
 basic cubic are also <U+FB01>xed points on the basic cubic, i. e. they are
 the points of intersection of the basic plane by the two genera
 ting lines parallel to the nodal directrix. Hence the cubic meets
 the basic cubic in nine <U+FB01>xed points, viz. the node counting as
 four points, the three points at in<U+FB01>nity, and the two points the
 feet of the generators parallel to the nodal direetrix. It follows
 that if U=O is the equation of the basic cubic, V=O the equa
 tion of some other cubic meeting the basic cubic in the nine
 points in question, then the equation of ‘ the cubic ’ is U +7tV=O,
_7t being a parameter the value of which varies according to the
 position (in the series of parallel planes) of the plane of the sec
 tion. Suppose that the basic cubic U=O is given, and suppose
 for a moment that the cubic V=O is also given, these two cubics
 having the above-mentioned relations, viz. they have a common
 node and parallel asymptotes: the cubic U-I-7\.V=O might be
 constructed by drawing through the node (say 0) a radius
 vector meeting the cubics in P, P’ respectively, and taking on
 this radius vector a point Q such that PQ= -i%PP', 01', what
                              OP + 7tOP'
 is the same thing, OQ=                   ; the locus of the point Q
                                 1 +7»
 will then be the cubic U+7\,V=O. And we may even suppose
 the cubic V=O to break up into a line and a conic (hyperbola),
 and then (disregarding the line) use the hyperbola in the con
 struction. In fact, if the hyperbola is determined by the follow
 ing <U+FB01>ve conditions, viz. to pass through the node and through the
 feet of the two generators parallel to the nodal directrix, and to
 have its asymptotes parallel to two of the asymptotes of the basic
 cubic, and if the line be taken to be a line through, the node
 parallel to the third asymptote of the basic cubic, then the
 hyperbola and line form together a cubic curve meeting the
 basic cubic in the nine points, and therefore satisfying the con
 ditions assumed in regard to the cubic V=O. And it is to be
 noticed that as- in general the cubic V=O is the projection of
 some section of the scrole, so the hyperbola and line are the
 projection of a section of the scrole, viz. the section through one
 of the generating lines (there are three such lines) parallel to
 the basic plane. But it is better to construct ‘the cubic ’ by a dif
 ferent method, using only the basic cubic U=0, and which re
 sults more immediately from the geometrical theory. Taking the

basic plane as the plane of the <U+FB01>gure,
let 0 be the node, or foot of the nodal
directrix, K the foot of the single
 directrix, K k the projection of the
single directrix, k being the projection
of the point in which the single direc
trix meets the plane of the section.
Drawing through 0 any radius vector
meeting the basic cubic in P, and the
line K k in r, and producing it to a pro
perly determined point Q, 0 P 1' Q will
be the projection of the generating line
which meets the nodal directrix, the
basic cubic, the single directrix, and the section in the points the
projections whereof are O, P, r, Q respectively. And the consi
deration of the solid <U+FB01>gure shows easily that the condition for
the determination of the point Q, is
                               i       Pr
                            PQ-—     - ;K'
Hence, starting from the basic cubic and the line K /c, we have a
construction for the point Q the locus whereof is the cubic, the
projection of a section of the scrole; for the projections of the
parallel sections, we have only to vary the length K It. By what
precedes, the construction gives for the locus of Q a cubic having
a node at O, and having its asymptotes parallel to those of the
basic cubic. As P moves up to K, the distances P r, r K become
inde<U+FB01>nitely small; but their ratio is <U+FB01>nite, hence the cubic, the
locus of Q, does not pass through the point K. The construction
shows, however, that it does pass through the points L, M, which
are the other two intersectionsof K /c with the basic cubic ; these
points L, M are in fact the feet of the generators parallel to the
nodal directrix.
    The general conclusion i, that a series of cubics having each
of them at one and the same given point a n0de—having their
asymptotes parallel——and besides passing through the same two '
given points—-—may be considered as the projections of a series of
parallel sections of a cubic scrole; and such a series of cubics
will thus afford a delineation of the scrole.

LXX. Observations on a passage in Professor Tyndall's Lectures
         on Force and on Heat. By D. D. HEATH, Esq.*
   N the abstract of Professor Tyndall’a Lecture on Force deli
      vered at the Royal Institution Juue 6, 1862, there occurs
the following passage :—
   “ There is one other consideration connected with the perma
nence of our present terrestrial conditions, which is well worthy
of our attention. Standing upon one of the London bridges, we
observe the current of the Thames reversed, and the water poured
upward twice a day. The water thus moved rubs against the
river’s bed and sides, and heat is the consequence of this fric
tion. The heat thus generated is in part radiated into space,
and then lost, as far as the earth is concerned. What is it that
supplies this incessant loss? The earth’s rotation. Let us look
a little more closely at the matter. Imagine the moon <U+FB01>xed, and
the earth turning like a wheel from west to east in its diurnal
rotation. Suppose a high mountain on the earth’s surface; on
approaching the moon’s meridian, that mountain is, as it were,
laid hold of by the moon, and forms a kind of handle by which
the earth is pulled more quickly round. But when the meridian
is passed the pull of the moon on the mountain would be in the
oppoite direction, it now tends to diminish the velocity of rota
tion as much as it previously augmented it ; and thus the action
of all <U+FB01>xed bodies on the earth’s surface is neutralized. But sup
pose the mountain to he always to the east of the moon’s meri
dian, the pull then would be always exerted against the earth’s
rotation, the velocity of which would be diminished in a degree
corresponding to the strength of the pull. The tidal wave occu
pies this position: it lies always to the east of the moon’s meri
dian‘; and thus the waters of the ocean are in part dragged as a
brake along the surface of the earth, and as a brake they must
diminish the velocity of the earth’s rotation. The diminution,
though inevitable, is, however, too small to make itself felt
within the period over which observations on the subject extend.
 Supposing then that we turn a mill by the action of the tide,
and produce heat by the friction of the millstones; that heat
has an origin totally different from the heat produced by another
mill which is turned by a mountain stream. The former is pro
duced at the expense of the earth’s rotation, the latter at the
expense of the sun’s radiation.”
    The paragraph is repeated word for word in the ‘ Lectures on
 Heat.’ There is a reference to Mayer in both places, which
leaves me in doubt whether Professor Tyndall has given any
 serious attention to the matter himself, or has merely copied
                     * Communicated by the Author.

 532               Mr. D. D. Heath on a passage in
 what he found in an author whom he trusts. Not having access
 to Mayer, I will speak of the argument as his own.
     I cannot persuade myself that it is not vague, incorrect, and
 inconsistent. If, however, it had appeared in any transactions
 or other work addressed to the learned, I should not have med
 dled with it: they can take care of themselves.          But where it
 is, it comes with the authority of a teacher, and its doctrine will
 be quoted in all the drawing-rooms in London, and I hope in
 all the schools in the kingdom. Therefore I think that, if ques
 tionable, it ought to be questioned, and an explanation called for.
    My <U+FB01>rst difficulty is in ascertaining what is meant to be
 asserted. The statement at the end, that “the heat produced
by the friction of the millstones of a tide-mill is produced at
 the expense of the earth’s rotation,” paralleled as it is with
 “the heat of another mill turned by a mountain stream ”-
 which is indisputably derived from the work done by, and there
 fore is entirely “ at the expense of the sun’s radiation,”-—leads
to the inference that the thing spoken of is all the heat produced
everywhere by the tidal action; and that it is conceived that this
heat, estimated in its dynamical equivalent, would on an average
be found to be at all events not greater than the contemporaneous
loss of vis viva of rotation.
    But the most elementary consideration of the matter shows
that this is not so. The heat developed at each point is practi
cally ascertained by the strength of the current (i. e. of the rela
tive velocity of the water), and the coefficient of friction ; and as
the velocity of the current is sensible and the supposed retarda
tion of rotation is quite insensible in thousands of years, it is
quite indifferent to the calculation whether there is a retardation
or not. When Professor Tyndall drops his leaden ball from the
top of his lecture-room, it is mathematically correct to state that
the earth moves, or tends to move, upwards to meet it with an
equal momentum *, and that the collision will generally cause a
loss of motion and of vis viva in the earth as well as in the ball :
but if the same experiment happened to be performing simulta
neously at his antipodes, the earth’s motion would be neutralized.
His formula, that “the heat generated increases as the square of
the velocity,” is strictly true only in the latter case; but the
error in the former is in<U+FB01>nitesimally small; for though the mo
mentum of the earth is equal to that of the ball, its loss of via
viva is immeasurably less. And in like manner, even if every
tidal motion over the whole ocean were checking the rotation,
the whole mass of the water is so small that the loss of vis viva
and production of heat would be rightly calculated from the loss
   * Mr. Grove, by the way, does not seem to be aware of this elementary
doctrine (Correlation of Forces, 4th ed. p. 20).

of relative motion in it alone. And much more is this true
when the tidal motions are contemporaneously acting in all pos
sible directions, some helping and others retarding the mean
rotation, and so, if not keeping it constant, at all events redu
cing the retardation to a small residual phenomenon.
   Is then the statement about “ the heat produced” and the
comparison with the stream-mill an inadvertence? 01' do I mis
understand it? And is the true meaning of the paragraph to be
found in the earlier portion, where it is said that “the earth’s
rotation supplies the loss of that part of the heat which is radi~
ated into space 1?” Of the whole energy extracted from the tide,
is a part restored to it in some way by the resulting heat ? and
does the rest escape, leaving the earth’s rotation in some way to
make up the balance?
   I have already said that the vis viva lost by the earth must be
immeasurably small compared to that lost by the tide. But what
part of the heat representing the total loss is ultimately radiated
into space? Is it reasonable to suppose it much, if at all, less
than the whole? I should suppose that much the greater part of
the heat generated would be at once seized by the wate1', and in
the <U+FB01>rst instance tend towards increasing the temperature of the
ocean, but that this tendency would discharge itself at the sur
face by evaporation and radiation, and that a similar passage
through the atmosphere would end in radiating the amount
received. And the course of the rest through the solid earth to
the atmosphere into space, though more complicated, would, I
suppose, be similar. If there is a secular change going on in the
temperature of the super<U+FB01>cial strata, of the sea, of the air, or if
there is any other increasing call for any of the work that heat
may do, the case may be otherwise. But all the heat produced
and not radiated must be for ever producible in the form of ad
 ditional temperature or work, mechanical or “internal,” done
 in the system: and I <U+FB01>nd in the passage quoted neither argu
ment nor even suggestion of any causal connexion either between
 the heat retained and the maintenance of the tide, or of the part
 radiated and the destruction of the rotation.
    I conceive, then, that it is certain that the total heat of the
 millstones is not “at the expense of,” or derived from, the de
 struction of the earth’s rotation, and that no reason is shown for
 thinking that the millionth part of it is so. Rather, I should
 say that, if there be any “slip ” or loss of rotation by the earth,
 there is ground for thinking the total heat generated is by so
 much less than it would have been had any extraneous cause
 maintained the original amount. And this seems to dispose of
the main point of the paragraph.
    But further, whether the rotation is diminishing or not, there

 534              Mr. D. D. Heath on a passage in
 does not appear to me to be any cogency in the very picturesque
 argument or illustration by which the a<U+FB02>irmative is enforced.
     For what are the essential conditions of the “ mountain on the
 earth’s surface?” It is <U+FB01>xed to the solid earth, otherwise equably
 rotating and indifferent to the moon’s action. The direct action
 is on the mountain alone, which therefore begins to move. This
motion is arrested by the <U+FB01>xed attachment of the base, and there
upon a tension is set up which is the efficient cause of the rest of
the mass participating in the impressed motion. The moving
force is the attraction on the mountain, and the mass moved the
whole earth, and the numerical calculation is perfectly de<U+FB01>nite:
but all depends on the actual strain. If the mountain were a
satellite close to the surface and subject to the attraction of the
solid earth, it would itself be affected by the moon’s attraction,
but would not affect the earth. Now none of these conditions
are proved to be present, and some are absent, in the tidal phe
nomena. There is no more cohesion between the crest of the
wave and its base than between an apparently <U+FB01>xed cloud and
the mountain top on which it rests: both are merely permanent
shapes of shifting materials. If one were to try to form the
equation for the moving force and the mass moved, how would
one proceed? The only connexion is that of friction and of
pressure. Both of these (if the latter can be at all conceived as
an unilaterally effective force exerted by the superimposed crest
on the subjacent waters) depend directly on the velocities and in
ternal disposition of the waters; only indirectly, through these,
on the moon’s action; and for aught that is shown these may
be acting in the direction of the rotation at that point, and at
any rate are as likely as not to be less energetic there, in whatever
direction, than at some other points. All that can be said, as it
appears to me, is that the moon’s attraction at the crest tends to
increase any existing velocity towards the west, or to diminish
any in the opposite direction. But then the rest of the ocean is
swaying to and fro also, and it cannot be asserted that it (like
the supposed solid globe) is indifferent, or that this increased
attraction at the crest may not be merely the exact equipoise
wanted to prevent an acceleration of rotation.
    The question, therefore, whether “the waters are in part
dragged as a brake from east to west,” seems to me unaffected,
or at least not settled by the fact of the existence of crests lying
obliquely to the moon. Are they? Laplace and Airy say they
are not * ; but in the cursory inspection I have made of their pages
I have not lighted upon the proof of their assertion. They also
give proofs'|' that precession and nutation (and it fortiori the

earth’s rotation) are una<U+FB02>"ected by the <U+FB02>uctuations and friction
of the tides. But I will not take upon myself to say their proofs
are conclusive; and indeed my impression is that all Laplace
means is that the difference, if an ', is of an order that may be
neglected in comparison with the disturbances he takes account
of. The following considerations, which have suggested them
selves, or partly have been suggested to me on this subject, are
only added in the hopes of eliciting some remarks from one or
other of the accomplished mathematicians who write in this
Magazine.
   If m be the mass of the moon, rits distance, and 1:: its angular
velocity (both projected on the equatorial plane), MKiz the mo
ment of inertia of the earth and sea taken in its instantaneous
shape, (0 its angular velocity; and if P be taken to represent
twice the sum of the products of each molecule of the sea by the
square of its distance from the polar axis and by its relative velo
city eastward ; we shall have, from age to age, by the principle of
the conservation of areas,
             m<U+FB01>w + MKQw + P = a constant quantity.
P is an extremely small quantity compared with the other terms;
and MK*, though it may vary, must do so within narrow limits.
If therefore rear, or the area described by the moon in a second,
vary much, it must be “ at the expense of” w, the earth’s velocity
of rotation.
   Now it seems very precarious to assume as a permanent law
of nature, or even as an established existing fact, that the con<U+FB01>
guration of the ocean under tidal in<U+FB02>uence may be even roughly
likened, as to its attraction on the moon, to a prolate spheroid.
A glance at a tide-map will show but little outward resemblance
to this <U+FB01>gure; and as to theory, the Astronomer Royal warns us
(p. 285) that “the amount of elevation of the water depends in
a remarkable degree upon other circumstances than the magni
tude of the forces. . . . . In two parallel canals of different depths
acted on by precisely the same forces, there might be high water
in one when there was low water in the adjacent part of the
other: or there might be elevations and depressions at the same
time in both, but their magnitudes might bear any proportions
whatever.”
   But if this common representation has so much substantial
truth as to justify us in assuming two wave-crests exactly anti
podal to each other, and either equal in elevation or the nearest
to the moon not less than the other, we should then have an ex
ceedingly small tangential force (being the dz<U+FB01>krence of two small
attractions multiplied by the sincs of two small and nearly equal
angles) in the direction of the moon’s motion; and this would

constantly increase the area described per second, or r’or. ' And
if this state of things continued for ever, it would seem that the
diurnal rotation must be drawn upon. But as the tidal effects
would decrease with the increasing distance of the moon, and so
the disturbing elevations themselves tend to disappear, and pro
bably also to become less oblique, it is perhaps premature to assert
anything on this subject. Whether in the course of this process
there would be a loss of ois viva in the whole system more than
enough to account for the work done in pushing the moon away
from the centre, would be another question to be solved before
Professor Tyndall could draw upon this fund for some in<U+FB01>nite
simal supply of heat.
   lf, then, the continual maintenance of the tides is incompa
tible with the existence of internal friction without some external
renewing force, I conceive the natural and the only conclusion
would be, that the tidal <U+FB02>uctuations themselves must be dimi
nishing, and that whether the rotation be also slackening or not.
But as I do not see my way to imagining any state of things in
which an ocean solicited by external bodies can be without tidal
motion, I confess I believe that there is no such incompatibility—
that the simple account of the matter is, that the moon’s attrac
tive force (which, acting on a world where the coe<U+FB02>icient of fric
tion happened to be less, would produce a greater oscillation)
spends itself partly on overcoming friction, and partly on produ
cing a constant wave, but one less than is indicated by a theory
which neglects friction.      I suppose that the sudden addition of
a satellite to a planet would get up a tide in spite of frictional
resistance. If so, its continual presence can keep it up.

                        [Continued from p. 219.]
          STE.-CLAIRE DEVILLE has made* the following
       0 observations on the phenomenon of the dissociation of
water.
    When even a rapid current of hydrogen is passed through a
 porous tube and the emergent gas collected, it is found to con
 sist of pure air instead of hydrogen. Hence the hydrogen is
 dispersed in the atmosphere, and the air is absorbed in the
 inside of the porous tube in virtue of endosmose.
    If this porous tube is <U+FB01>tted, by means of perforated corks,
                  * Comptes Renolus, February 2, 1863.

             M. Deville on the Dissociation of Water.          537
in a shorter impermeable porcelain tube, an annular space is
obtained between the tubes which may be <U+FB01>lled with any gas.
For this purpose a glass tube is <U+FB01>tted in the cork at each end,
by one of which the gas is admitted, and by the other of which
it emerges. The porous tube is likewise <U+FB01>tted with tubes, by
which a different gas may enter the tube at one end and emerge
at the other. The apparatus being thus arranged, if a current
of carbonic acid is introduced into the annular space between
the two tubes, and a regulated current of hydrogen into the
interior of the porous tube, hydrogen gas may be lighted at the
tube <U+FB01>tting in the annular space where the carbonic acid would
be expected to emerge, while from the porous tube almost pure
 carbonic acid emerges. Thus in virtue of endosmose these
 gases have changed place; the experiment is well suited for lec
 ture purposes.
    If the apparatus thus arranged be heated in a furnace from
 1100° to 1300°C., it may be used to demonstrate the pheno
 menon of the spontaneous decomposition of water which Deville
has called diss0ciation*. In this case the annular space is
<U+FB01>lled with coarse fragments of biscuit-porcelain. Instead of hy
 drogen, aqueous vapour is made to arrive in the interior of the
porous tube, while carbonic acid is passed into the annular space.
 The gases are collected in long glass tubes placed in a bath
 containing caustic potash, to stop all carbonic acid. When the
 furnace is in full activity, a highly explosive gaseous mixture is
 collected consisting of hydrogen and oxygen. Here the aqueous
 vapour is spontaneously decomposed inside the porous tube; the
 hydrogen traverses the porous diaphragm, which thus, like an
 ordinary <U+FB01>lter, separates it from the oxygen. A considerable
 quantity of carbonic acid diffuses and mixes with the hydrogen.
    The detonating gas is not quite pure: the action of hydrogen
 on carbonic acid produces a certain quantity of carbonic oxide.
 Notwithstanding all possible precautions, too, a certain quantity
 of hydrogen always escapes, and the detonating gas always con
 tains an excess of oxygen. It further contains some nitrogen,
 which is introduced along with carbonic acid.
    The carbonic acid determines in the operation the separation
 of the gases by endosmose, but it may also act mechanically.
 Water alone, heated in a porcelain tube even to almost the fusing
 point of platinum, emerges entirely unchanged, and is not de
 composed to any appreciable extent.
    To explain these facts, Deville enters into the following con
 siderations. The temperature of the combustion of hydrogen
 and oxygen docs certainly not exceed 2500° C. At this point
 the gases occupy a volume ten times that which they occupy at
                      " Phil. Mag. vol. xx. p. 448.

  38       ' M. Deville an the Dissociation of Water.
0°: it is the limit beyond which water is entirely decomposed.
But this decomposition is accompanied, as will be seen, by a
considerable absorption of latent heat, which is necessary to
maintain the molecules of hydrogen and oxygen at a greater
distance than the radius of the sphere of their a<U+FB02>inity. The
phenomenon is analogous to that of the ebullition of liquids, in
taking place at the same temperature, whatever be that of the
source of heat.    In short, water cannot resist the action of a
temperature which decuples its volume at 0°, and then it decom
poses, while its elements absorb latent heat, which he calls
latent heat of decomposition, the amount and existence of which
may be readily calculated.
   According to Clausius, the speci<U+FB01>c heat of a body does not vary
with the temperature. Thequantity of heat produced in the
formation of a gramme of water, from Favre and Silbcrmann’s
determinations, is 3883 thermal units. Now the quantity of
heat absorbed by a gramme of water in passing from 0° to 2500°
is given by the formula
                 637+ (2500—100)0'475=1680,
in which 637' is the quantity of heat needed to transform 1
gramme of water into vapour at 100°, while (f2500—100)0'475
is the heat needed to raise this vapour from 100° to 2500°. The
di<U+FB01>ierence between 3833 and 1680: 2153 thermal units repre
sents the latent heat of the decomposition of water, the heat
absorbed by its elements at the moment of their separation.
   The comparison between the effects of cohesion and affinity
is maintained in the inverse phenomena, volatilization and de
composition. Assuming this relation, the decomposition of
bodies at a relatively low temperature, or the phenomenon of
dissociation, corresponds to the vaporization of a liquid at a
temperature below its boiling-point, and the quantity of the
body decomposed will be proportional to its tension’ of dissocia
tion expressed in millimetres of mercury, as the quantity of
vapour formed above a liquid is proportional to the maximum
tension of its vapour.
   A liquid has no tension in its own vapour, and the quantity of
water vaporized in a closed space compared with the volume of .
water is very small. In like manner the quantity of vapour
dissociated at 1200° in a porcelain balloon is so small that the
density of vapour is not affected by it.
   Of water placed in a closed vessel of small volume, the quan
tity vaporized is very small, the tension of the liquid being
annulled as soon as the space is saturated; but if a fragment of
chloride of calcium is introduced, the water will evaporate until
this is lique<U+FB01>ed, the tension always remaining the same. This

                M. Wiihler on a New Oxide of Silicon.          539
is the part which silver and oxide of lead play in aqueous vapour
dissociated at 1000°. They absorb the oxygen; and if simul
taneously the hydrogen were removed, the decomposition would
continue until the complete saturation of the auxiliary bodies.
   In heating aqueous vapour as described in this memoir, an
effect is produced analogous to that of exposing a volatile liquid
to a current of gas, a vessel full of water in a current of dry air.
In the above experiment the carbonic acid carries away, while
the porous tube separates, the quantities of oxygen and hydrogen
which the tension of the dissociation of aqueous vapour at this
temperature produces.
   According to W6hler*, when a mixture of chloride of calcium,
silico<U+FB02>uoride of sodium, and sodium are melted together, a
compound of calcium with silieium is obtained. This silicide
of calcium forms small cylindrical prisms which have the appear
ance of graphite, and are of an iron-black colour with a semi
metallic lustre.     These prisms, like some crystals of mica, may
be split into small round discs. The body is unaltered by air
or water, but is violently attacked by hydrochloric acid with
a copious disengagement of hydrogen, and is changed into a
yellow substance without losing the form of the disc.
   The body thus formed appears to be a new oxide of silicon,
and has the following properties. It is of an intense sulphur
yellow colour, and consists of small transparent laminae: when
moist, it gradually becomes white in the air. Gently heated in
the air, it ignites, and burns with a luminous <U+FB02>ame, leaving
silicic acid, which is coloured by amorphous silicon. Heated in
a tube, it disengages spontaneously in<U+FB02>ammable siliciuretted
hydrogen gas, and leaves a mixture of silica and amorphous
silicon in dark-brown lustrous lamina. Treated with dilute
ammonia, it is converted into gelatinous silica, hydrogen being
copiously disengaged. VVith stong ammonia it ignites. Soda
acts in the same manner, while <U+FB02>uoric acid is without action.
   Hitherto the analyses have not given conclusive results, which
arises from the di<U+FB01>icnlty of obtaining the body quite pure.
   Linnemann has investigated']' the action of nascent hydrogen
on benzophenone, the ketone of benzoic acid. The material was
prepared by distilling benzoate of lime with lime, and the part
distilling between 290° and 325° taken for experiment. The
action of sodium-amalgam upon it is brisk, but little hydrogen
is liberated. After some time the soda formed diminishes the
energy of the action ; and this is removed by neutralization with
sulphuric acid and <U+FB01>ltration from sulphate of soda, which is <U+FB01>rst

 washed with alcohol, then with ether. These united wash
 ings are mixed with water until turbidity sets in; the liquid is
 then agitated with ether; on evaporating the ether, the substance
 remains free from soda. This is again dissolved in aqueous
 alcohol, and treated with sodium-amalgam until free hydrogen
 is disengaged. The substance is <U+FB01>nally exhausted with ether,
 shaken with water to remove alcohol, and <U+FB01>nally evaporated
 spontaneously. A yellowish liquid is left which solidi<U+FB01>es on
 lengthened standing, or immediately if touched. This is <U+FB01>nally
 crystallized from benzole, from which it is deposited in white
 silky needles.     The composition of the substance, which Linne
 mann provisionally calls benzhydrole, is G‘3 H" 9 ; it is formed
 from benzophenone, G“ H‘° 9, by the assimilation of four atoms
 of hydrogen.
    It is insoluble in cold water, but completely soluble in alcohol,
 ether, and benzole. It melts at 67°'5, and it distils at 296° to
 297° without decomposition. As far as it has yet been investi
 gated, it appears to be a monatomic alcohol. By being heated
 with benzoic acid, it forms a compound which can be obtained
 crystallized in small colourless transparent cubes which melt at
 80°, and are decomposed by potash into benzoic acid and benz
hydrole. The analysis of this compound led to the formula

    Lautemann has examined* the action of iodide of phosphorus
 on picric acid. VVhen iodide of phosphorus is added to a strong
aqueous solution of picric acid, a violent reaction is set up,
which raises the liquid to ebullition; when almost all iodide of
phosphorus is decomposed and phosphuretted hydrogen begins
to be disengaged, carbonic acid is passed through the liquid,
which drives off water and excess of hydriodic acid. The liquid,
when adequately concentrated in this manner, solidi<U+FB01>es, on
cooling, to a mass of long needles. These constitute the ter
iodide of a new triatomic ammonium which the author names

It cannot resist the feeblest oxidizing action, and even by being

hydrated oxide of picrammonium or its triamine have failed.

      MM. Millon and Commaille on the Reduction ofSilver.        541
  The author has described the sulphate,‘ the acid sulphate, and
  the acid phosphate, all of which salts crystallize well.
     Lautemann has found* that, by the action of hydriodic acid,
  kinic acid, C“H" O", is reduced to benzoic acid, C“ H5 O‘;
  the action succeeds both by heating an aqueous solution of
 hydriodic acid with kinic acid, and by heating an aqueous solu
 tion of -kinic acid with iodide of phosphorus. In the latter case
 the quantity of benzoic acid obtained is almost that required
 theoretically.
     The author has also found that kinic acid is reduced to benzoic
 acid when taken into the organism.
     According to Millon and Cornmaille"I', when a solution of
 ammoniacal subchloride of copper is added to a solution of
 nitrate of silver, also containing ammonia, an instantaneous
 precipitate of absolutely pure metallic silver is obtained. The
 precipitated silver is amorphous, and in the very <U+FB01>nest state of
 division, while that obtained by electric currents or by metals
 is always crystalline and generally lustrous. The amorphous
 silver is of alight grey, but sometimes almost white ; under the
 burnisher it takes the brightest metallic lustre, and in virtue of
 its <U+FB01>ne state of division it can be applied to the most varied
 materials, such as wood, stone, leather, 860.
    By the weight of silver precipitated, the quantity of suboxide
of copper engaged in the reaction is at once determined; the
presence of protosalt does not interfere with the reaction, which
thus gives at once an accurate method of analysing a mixture of
proto_ and sub-salt of copper.
    The authors <U+FB01>nd that the chloride of silver in ammoniacal
solution is precipitated by this method, which is thus very well
  uited for working up laboratory residues. They also suggest
its application on the large scale to the extraction of silver from
argentiferous minerals.
    Kolbe and Lautemann foundi that when sodium is dissolved
in phenylic alcohol, C" H6 O‘*, in an atmosphere of carbonic acid,

the homologous cresylic alcohol, C“ H8 O’, and thymylic alcohol,

alcohol. The eugenic acid was prepared by boiling oil of cloves
with caustic soda to expel hydrocarbons, precipitation with
hydrochloric acid, and recti<U+FB01>cation of the oil thus separated.
Scheuch found that the eugenic acid thus prepared contained
salicylic acid, from which it was separated by treatment with
ammonia.
    About 50 grammes of the puri<U+FB01>ed oil were placed in a retort
 and a rapid current of carbonic acid passed through it, while
 about 3 grammes of sodium were added ; the mixture was <U+FB01>nally
 somewhat heated to complete the reaction. The product solidi
 <U+FB01>ed on subsequent cooling to a mass consisting of undecom
 posed eugenic acid, the soda-salt of a new acid, eugetinic acid,
 NaO, C” H11 07, and of the soda-salt of an isomeric acid analo
 gous in its composition to carbovinic acid.        This is treated with
 hydrochloric acid, which liberates eugenic acid, and decomposes
 the carboeugenic acid into carbonic acid and eugenic acid, chlo
 ride of sodium being formed. The eugenic acid separates as
 oil and is removed, while the eugetinic acid remains in solution.
 On treating this liquid with carbonate of ammonia, then adding
 hydrochloric acid, shaking with ether, the eugetinic acid is dis
 solved out. On subsequently evaporating the etherial solution
 and crystallizing the residue from hot water, the new acid is
 obtained in long, thin, colourless prisms, which melt at 124° C.

 ultimately, however, acquired greater similarity to that of amylic
 alcohol. The alkaline liquid from this <U+FB01>rst treatment was then
 treated several times successively with fresh amalgam, and the
 resultant liquid mixed with chloride of calcium and distilled. To
 this distillate chloride of calcium was added, on which a super
 natant liquid, amounting to about one-tenth of the acroleine
 used, was separated. This was repeatedly recti<U+FB01>ed over chloride
 of calcium and then fractionally distilled. About two-thirds
 distilled over between 86° and 90°, and the rest between 90° and
 100°. Of the fraction between 86° and 90° the boiling-point
 was found to be constant at 87° to 88°. This had the composition
 of propylic alcohol, and the boiling-point is also the same as that
 found by Friedel for propylic alcohol prepared from acetone1'.
 The fraction distilling betwen 90° and 99° was found to have a
 constant boiling-point at 96° to 98°, which is that of propylic
 alcohol obtained from fermentation, and its composition is also
 the same. Linnemann thinks that there are two isomeric pro
 pylic alcohols whose boiling-points differ by about 10°, and both
 of which are formed by the treatment of acroleine with sodium
 amalgam. Their formation takes place by the assimilation of
 two molecules of hydrogen,

acid, G3 H4 9’, into propionic acid, G3 H6 92, by the action of
 sodium-amalgam, that is, by means of hydrogen in the nascent
state.

            “ On the Relative Speed of the Electric Wave through Subma
     rine Cables of dilferent lengths, and a unit of Speed for comparing
     Electric Cables by bisecting the Electric Wave.”      By Cromwell F.
     Varley, Esq.
        The present paper gives the results of some experiments which
     were undertaken to determine, <U+FB01>rst, the relative speed of the elec
     tric wave through cables of various lengths; secondly, the retarding
     c<U+FB01>'ect of the iron covering of the cable; and thirdly, methods for the
     increase of the speed of the electric wave.
        When a long submarine cable or subterranean wire is connected at
     one end through a galvanometer to the earth, and the other end is
     connected with a battery, a current <U+FB02>ows through it, de<U+FB02>ecting the
 , galvanometer-needle.
         If the needle be made very light and small, so as to have but a
      small amount of inertia, and the cable be long, the current will be
      seen to arrive after the lapse of a short but appreciable interval of
      time, and will gradually augment in intensity approaching to, but
. never attaining, the maximum.
        Professor Thomson has investigated this subject mathematically,
      and arrived at the conclusion that in submarine cables of di<U+FB02>"erent
     lengths the speed is inversely as the square of the distance.
        Through the Atlantic Cable, the conducting wire of which weighed
      93 lbs. to the statute mile, and the length of which was rather more
     than 2300 statute miles, the electric current did not show itself on
  ' Thomson’s sensitive re<U+FB02>ecting galvanometer until more than one
     second after contact had been made with the battery at the other end.
         In experiments made by the author in 1854 upon 1600 miles of
     wire between London and Manchester, connected up in one continuous
     circuit, the current was not visible upon the chemical recording
     instruments then in use until after the lapse of about three seconds.
        These experiments were repeated by Professor Faraday; and he
     has made known the results.

On the Speed ofthe Electric Wave Ehrough Submarine Cables. 549
   From the imponderable nature of electricity (considered for a mo
ment as a <U+FB02>uid), from its incompressibility, and other circumstances,
the author infers that the electric current commences <U+FB02>owing out at
the one end at the very instant that contact is made with the batterv
at the other end; but it is a considerable time before it reaches ah
appreciable strength; it then goes on augmenting in strength, ap
proaching to, but never absolutely attaining, its maximum force.
   As the <U+FB01>rst part of the wave commences to appear instantly, and
as the top of the wave would require an inde<U+FB01>nitely long period of
time to be reached, it will be evident that the part of the wave best
suited for investigation is half the maximum, as at that period the
changes of its intensity in a given time are more rapid than at any
other.
   When attempting to measure by means of a galvanometer the
arrival of the wave at half its maximum, the weight and momentum
of the magnet of the galvanometer were found to interfere so much
that, excepting through very long lengths of cable, nothing approach
ing to an accurate determination of the speed could be obtained.
The use of electro-magnets was equally, if not more, objectionable,
as they require a very appreciable but uncertain time to be mag
netized.
   The following method, however, of bisecting the electric wave has
obviated these di<U+FB01>iculties, and admits of the determination of the
relative rates of transmission through cables of different lengths with
very great accuracy.
   The machine used consisted of an axle carrying two “commuta
tors.”    This axle was driven by clockwork, governed, in one case,
by a <U+FB02>y rotating in mercury, and in the second experiment by
means of a <U+FB02>y in the air, together with a friction spring.
    The commutator consists of two wheels, each wheel being in two
halves.    Upon the broad edge of the wheel rest two springs, one of
which is connected with one pole of the battery, and the other with
the other pole.      The two halves of the wheel were constantly
connected, by means of two other springs, the one with the cable
wire, and the other with the earth, so that when the wheel was
turned round, during one half of the revolution a positive current
was <U+FB02>owing through the cable wire, and during the other a negative.
 The other commutator on the same axle was precisely similar in
construction; but the two springs resting on the edge of the wheel
 were connected with two wires of a galvanometer, and one half of
 the wheel was connected with the receiving end of the cable wire
 tested, and the other half of the commutator was connected with
the earth.
    The two commutators were so arranged that when, by the rotation
of the wheel, the current of electricity from the battery was reversed,
 the connexions of the galvanometer were reversed also ; and there
 fore, if the speed of the electric wave through the cable were inde
 <U+FB01>nitely great, the currents would <U+FB02>ow through the galvanometer in
 one direction, no matter how fast the currents in the cable are re
 versed. As, however, a given amount of time elapses before these
 waves reach theirmaximum at the distant end of the _circuit, and

550 ._       _   i      '  Royal Society                       ' f     ,
as also a given time elapses after the battery has been reversed
at the one end before the current is reversed at the other or
distant end, it is clear that by gradually augmenting the rate of
rotation of the commutator until the wheel is a quarter of a revo
lution in advance of the wave, a point is arrived at when the galva
nometer’s connexions are reversed precisely at the moment that the
wave reaches its maximum strength, and consequently the wave is bi
sected, one half of it <U+FB02>owing through the galvanometer in one direction,
and the other half in the other. At this rate of rotation the galva
nometer falls to zero ; because, the wave being exactly bisected, the
one half tends to de<U+FB02>ect the needle to the right, and the other to the
left, but, owing to the weight of the needle and the rapidity of the
reversals, it (the needle) stands nearly steadily at zero. The galva
nometer used consisted of a rather heavy astatic pair of needles
suspended by a silk <U+FB01>bre. The wire acting upon the needles was
about the twentieth part of an inch in thickness, in order that it
should offer no serious resistance to the electric current. Its re
sistance was less than one Varley unit (1 mile copper wire 71;; inch in
diameter).
   The rate of rotation necessary to obtain the <U+FB01>rst zero is the point
recommended for comparing the relative speeds of the electric waves
through submarine cables of dilferent dimensions.          '
   By augmenting the speed beyond that necessary to produce the
<U+FB01>rst zero, the needle becomes de<U+FB02>ected in the opposite direction and
gradually approaches a maximum ; that is to say, when the electric
wave is half a revolution behind, the currents all <U+FB02>ow through the
galvanometer in one direction again. This is termed the second
maximum (the <U+FB01>rst maximum being that obtained when the wheel
is not rotating at all) ; and by augmenting the speed still more, until
the wave is three-quarters of a revolution behind, the wave is again
bisected and a second zero is obtained, and so on.               .
   The great variation of speed necessary to give these and other re
sults was such that the means then at the author’s disposal in the
<U+FB01>rst experiments were not sufficiently regular to admit of very ac
curate readings.
   The experiments now communicated were made upon two cables,
one containing six conducting wires, a portion of which was laid in
the Mediterranean. This cable had been lying exposed to sun and
weather in the East India Docks for some years, and the gutta percha
had become deteriorated to a considerable extent ; its exact length
was not known; and from these combined causes it could not be used
for determining the rate at which the wave travels through given
lengths, but it has served to demonstrate that Thomson’s “law of the
squares” is substantially correct in practice.
   In the experiments made on this cable, the resistance of the galva
nometer was equal to one mile of the cable. The battery power
used averaged from 12 to 36 cells of Daniell’s battery, each cell
offering a resistance of one-sixth of a mile of the cable.
   The <U+FB01>rst experiment was made upon two wires forming a loop of
about 150 miles in length; and when the currents were reversed at
the rate of 1516 per second, the needle came tozero.

On the Speed of the Electric Wave t/z1"ou_'gh Submarine Cables. 551'.
 . The second experiment was made through three wires, that is to
say, 225 miles of cable. The speed then obtained was 6'5 7. Through
four wires (i. e. double the length of <U+FB01>rst experiment) 3'78 reversals
per second were obtained.
     Through six wires, or three times the length of the <U+FB01>rst experi
ment, 1'75 per second were obtained, or inversely as the square of
the length.
  » In the foregoing experiments the current was made to pass up
one wire and down the second, up the third and down the fourth,
and so on; but in experiment No. 5, the current was made to pass
through all the six wires, one after the other, in the same direction,
the object being to determine, if possible, what amount of retarda
tion was attributable to the magnetization of the iron covering. On
the current through the <U+FB01>rst wire ceasing, a magneto-electric current
is produced in the opposite direction to the <U+FB01>rst magneto-electric
current; and consequently, when the wires were so connected that
the current went up one wire and down the second, up the third and
down the fourth, as in experiment No. 4, the magneto-electric
action upon No. 2 wire is counterbalanced by the magneto-electric
action upon No. 3, and so on; but in experiment No. 5 the mag
neto-electric current was in full force on all the wires.     The result,
however, did not show any appreciable difference in the speed of the
wave, as the machine then used could not be governed with sufficient
 accuracy.
   . Experiments were made to determine the effect of applying resist
ance to one end of the cable.    For instance, a telegraphic instrument,
when applied to the cable, augments the resistance of the circuit;
and when a resistance equal to half that of the cable was applied at
 one end, the rate of the electric wave through it was decreased to
 three-quarters. When a resistance equal to the whole of the cable
 was added at one end, so as to double the resistance of the whole
 circuit, the speed was reduced to about three-<U+FB01>fths; and when resist
 ance double that of the cable was added, the speed was reduced
 rather more than one-half.
     Variations in the electromotive force produced no sensible varia
 tion in the speed of the waves.
     The second series of experiments were tried upon the Dunwich
 and Zandvoort cable, after it was submerged, and consequently in It
 straight line, and not, as in the previous experiment, in a coiled mass ;_
 it was therefore exposed to much less magneto-electric induction.
 The insulation of_ this cable was very high indeed.
      The experiments on this cable, among other results, show that
 doubling the length of the circuit reduced the speed nearly four
 times. The experiments on the Mediterranean cable showed that
 with three times the length, the speed was reduced nearly nine times.
 With twice the length the speed was reduced nearly four times, or
 inversely as the square of the distance nearly.
      The mean of the experiments through 270 miles of cable are 4'76
 revolutionsof the wheel per second, or 9'52 reversals of the current
 per second.       -   -                                      -

552                        Geological Society :—
 cable, the speed was l'326 revolution of the wheel, or 2'65 reversals
 per second.      The reason why they do not follow the law of the
 squares exactly, is probably to be attributed to the resistance of the
battery used on this occasion, and also to the fact of the magneto
 electric induction of the iron exterior.
    Experiment 9 shows that, on the introduction midway in the cir
cuit of an escape (circuit derive), the resistance of which is equal
to half the circuit, the <U+FB01>rst zero is obtained at the rate of 2'7 8 revo
lutions per second, or 5'56 reversals per second; the introduction
of this escape about doubles the speed of transmission ; and thus,
by the establishment of a series of escapes judiciously along the cable,
the speed may be augmented to a very high degree without weaken
ing the current too much for the purposes of telegraphy. Expe
riments were then tried with currents of various durations ; and the
results of these experiments are very important, the highest speed
being obtained when the cable was connected to the battery for a very
short interval of time and immediately afterwards put to earth.         In
this way, through the 540 miles, the speed of the wave was increased
from 1326 to 3'7.
   In the experiments in which resistances of various amounts were
added to one end of the cable, the consequent retardations agree very
nearly with the results obtained upon the Mediterranean cable. It
was found to be immaterial at which end of the circuit the resistance
was added : this, however, can only hold good with highly inulated
wires ; for it is evident, upon a little consideration of the matter, that,
where the line is imperfectly insulated, the resistance added at the
sending end will produce more retardation than if applied to the re
ceiving end.
   In the experiments on the second zero and second maximum, it
is shown that, if the speed required to produce the <U+FB01>rst zero be taken
as unity, double that speed is necessary to produce the second maxi
mum, and four times the speed to get the second zero.
   Notwithstanding the difficulties under which these experiments
were made (from the necessity of using a machine the rates of whose
motion could not be very accurately governed), the results are still
sufficiently accurate for all “practical” purposes of submarine tele
graphy ; but such nice points as the retarding in<U+FB02>uence of the iron
covering cannot be inferred with any precision from these experi
ments.     It is certain, however, that in long cables the retarding
influence of the external iron covering is so small, compared with the
retardation due to electrical induction, that it may be neglected in

   "On the Permian Rocks of North-eastern Bohemia.” By Sir
Roderick I. Murchison, K.C.B., F.R.S., F.G.S. &c.
   The author, accompanied by Dr. Anton Fritsch, of Prague, made

           On the Permian Rocks 0fNortIz-eastern Bohemia.            553
 a transverse section of the rocks exposed by railroad-cuttings be
 tween Josefstadt on the S.S.E. and Semil on the N.N.W. These
 rocks, simply termed Roth-todt-liegende by the Austrian and Saxon
 geologists, are, however, of very varied mineral characters and of
 very considerable dimensions. They consist, in ascending order, of,
  1st, coarse conglomerate and sandstone, followed by thin courses
 of schist, with <U+FB01>shes (Palmonisci, &c.), and interstrati<U+FB01>ed igneous
 rocks (basaltic clinkstone, porphyry, &c.); 2nd, alternations of
 coarse grits and sandstone, with large Araucariles and other
 plants; and 3rd, of bituminous schists, in parts containing coal,
 with some layers of limestone, copper-slate, &c., and many fossil
 <U+FB01>shes in bituminous <U+FB02>agstone passing up into red-and-green-spotted
 sandstones and marls.                           i
     This series of rocks, though subject to local undulations, assumes
 at Liebstadtl a steady dip to the S.E., or away from the Riesenge
 birge; this is well seen'on the railway between Liebstadtl on the
 S.E. and Semil on the N.W., which section was described by the
 author in detail. The igneous rocks, chie<U+FB02>y amygdaloids and por
 phyries (Melaphyr), occur at various horizons in the series, and are
 supposed to have been for the most part of contemporaneous forma
 tion with the regular aqueous sediments.
     Alluding to the animal remains, as enumerated by Geinitz, the
 author stated that he was disposed to view the group as having
 chie<U+FB02>y an estuarine character, the various sauroid <U+FB01>shes and the
 coarse conglomerates leading to that inference; at the same time
 he admits that portions of it were probably freshwater and terrestrial
 accumulations. After pointing out the chief localities of the large
 fossil stems of the Araucarites and other plants, allusion was made
 to the opinion of Giippert and Geinitz, that the fauna of this group
 is, as a whole, distinct from that of the carboniferous age. He
-shows that the thickness of the whole of these rocks in Northern
 Bohemia is very considerable, as (at Erlbach) in the adjacent coun
 try of Saxony, the inferior half only of these deposits, or the lower
 Roth-liegende, has actually been sunk through by a shaft, in search
 of coal, to the depth of 2300 feet, as brought to his notice by Pro
 fessor Keilhau.
    In referring to the general relations of these rocks, he suggests
 that, as they vary very considerably in different regions, they are
 best de<U+FB01>ned by the word Permian, which, according to its original
 de<U+FB01>nition by himself and his associates in Russia, simply means that
 such rocks lie between the upper coal, on which they rest uncon
formably, and the lowest portion of the Trias, by which they are
 covered.
    It was observed that, in proceeding from north to south (in East
 ern Germany), the Zechstein thins out; and seeing the vast dimen
 sions which the group assumes where true Zechstein is no longer
traceable, the author suggests that some of the higher members of
the Bohemian Roth-liegende may represent that limestone in time.
The term Dyas, recently applied to the whole Permian group by
 Geinitz, is objected to, since it is based on the theory that the lower
portion of the Permian is exclusively of freshwater origin, as con

 554          '          Geological Society :—- '
 trasted with the superjacent marine Zechstein, and also because the
 geographical term Permian, involving no theory, had previously
 been widely adopted, and even used by Geinitz himself.
    Sir Roderick having expressed his great obligations to Dr. Geinitz,
 to whose excellent work (‘ Dyas ') he made many references, and to
 the name of which only he objected, concluded by presenting to the
 Society a very large collection of rock specimens of the Lower Per
 mian of Saxony.

    The order of succession of the subdivisions of the Inferior Oolite
 observed in passing from the southern side of the Mendips to the
 typical section of that formation at Leckhampton, with the litholo
 gical characters of the strata, were described in this paper. The
 classi<U+FB01>cation of the members of the Inferior Oolite employed by Mr.

 author; and it was shown that in proceeding from Bath northwards
 the two upper subdivisions may be seen to rise, the Building Free- -
 stone at the same time becoming thicker, while at Aveling the
 Oolite Marl is <U+FB01>rst seen interposed between the Lower Ragstone
 and the Lower Freestone, and at Nailsworth the former is separated
 from the Oolite Marl by the Upper Freestone, all these beds becoming
 thicker towards Cheltenham, and thinner in the opposite direction,
 towards Bath. Dr. Holl concluded with some remarks on the strata

    “On recent Changes in the Delta of the Ganges.” By James
Fergusson, Esq., F.R.G.S. Communicated by the President.
    Before describing the local phenomena of the Ganges, the author
explained, <U+FB01>rst, the laws that govern the extent of the oscillations
in reaches of rivers, either laterally or in the direction of their course ;
secondly, the causes operating to raise the banks of rivers <U+FB02>owing
through very <U+FB01>at plains above the level of the country at a little
distance from their margins ; and lastly, the immense relative thick
ness of the early deposits in deltas over those of later periods, when
the conditions of the river had come more nearly in equilibrium.             -
    Mr. Fergusson then proceeded to point out that in historical
 times the Brahmapootra and Ganges, on entering the plains of
 Bengal—passing Goalparah and Rajmahal respectively—ran ori
 ginally to the sea in a nearly due north and south course, parallel to
 one another. This symmetry was <U+FB01>rst disturbed by the upheaval of
 the Modopore jungle, north of Dacca, by which the Brahmapootra
 was diverted in a south-eastern direction into the depression known
 as the Sylhet Jheels, which were the result of the upheaval just
 described. He then further explained how the river, having <U+FB01>lled
 up these Jheels, had returned to its former bed within the limits of
 the present century.
    The paper then described the eifect this change had already pro
 duced in reopening the rivers of the western half of the Delta, and
 showed that, if it were maintained, it would have the effect of so
 raising the eastern half as to restore the course of the two great
 rivers very nearly to the position they occupied before the disturb
  ance above alluded to.
     The next point adverted to was the gradual retrocession of all
  the mouths of the tributaries of the Ganges, in consequence of the
  tilting back of the plain, by the gradual rise of the Deltaic plains.
     Mr. Fergusson then stated that he conceived we had su<U+FB02>lcient
  historical indications to show that within the last 5000 years the
  plain of Bengal has been nearly in the same condition that the
  valley at Assam now is-a jungly swamp, with only a few habit
  able spots here and there on the banks of the larger rivers.
     The last phenomenon alluded to was the “ Swatch of low ground’?
  1n the Bay of Bengal. This was ascribed to the action of the tides,
  which, being accelerated on either shore of the bay, acquired a;
  rotatory motion at the sand-heads, and, meeting in the centre of the
  bay, scooped or swept out this depression in the centre, and by
  this action prevented the growth of the Delta seaward to the extent
  that would otherwise take place.                      '

 ON THE OSCULATING TWISTED CUBIC TO A CURVE OF DOUBLE
    CURVATURE.       BY SIR WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON, LL.D., ETC
        To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
 IT may interest some readers of the Philosophical Magazine to
       know that one of the applications which, in my forthcoming
 work (Elements of Quaternions), have been made of my calculus to
 geometry relates to the determination of the osculating twisted cubic
 (or gauche curve of the third degree) to any proposed curve of double
 curvature.
    Another application relates to the locus of the osculating circle,
 which is at the same time the envelope of the osculating sphere, to any
 such curve in space.
    If permitted, I shall be happy to give some short sketch of each of
 those two investigations, in the Philosophical Magazine: and, in the
 mean time, I have given an outline of one of them to the Royal Irish
 Academy, at their general meeting.
        ON THE INDUCTIVE CAPACITY OF INSULATING BODIES.
                             BY M. GAUGAIN.
    The new theory of induction, propounded by Mr. Faraday twenty
 years ago, has given rise to numerous controversies; and it is not
 generally allowed that the inductive capacity is a special property,
 distinct from ordinary conductibility. But the problem of the deter
 mination of inductive capacities, viewed in the mannerl am about to
 point out, is a purely experimental question, and can be treated quite
 independently of any theoretical idea.
    According to Faraday’s views, the inductive capacity consists in
 the greater or less facility with which neutral electricity is decom
posed and recomposed in the interior of the same molecule, while
 conductibility consists in the greater or less facility with which the
electricity of one molecule is transmitted to the adjacent ones. But
holding to these notions, it would appear di<U+FB02>icult, if not impossible,
to distinguish the e<U+FB01>'ects of the inductive capacity from those of
ordinary conductibility; and to isolate the <U+FB01>rst, Mr. Faraday has
found no other means than that of rapidly charging and discharging
the condensers which he used.       But it seemed to me that, by work
ing in this manner, a new principle is virtually introduced, which
consists in assuming that the inductive capacity may be completely
manifested in an inappreciable time, while conductibility always
requires, to develope its e<U+FB01>ects, more or less of time. Taking this
character as a de<U+FB01>nition, the problem of the determination of the
inductive capacities may be stated in precise terms.
   As I have pointed out in a previous note (Phil. Mag. vol. xxiv.
p. 495), the charge of a given condenser put in communication with
a source of electricity depends on the time during which contact is
established (at all events when the dielectric is a solid body). Hence
the charge ought to have a maximum and a. minimum value ;
and the investigation of these two limits constitutes two perfectly

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                557
de<U+FB01>nite problems. But it follows from preceding considerations, that
the lower limit of these charges is precisely what is called the induc
tive capacity.
    In the above-mentioned note I have occupied myself in deter
mining the higher limit of the charge ;‘ in the present one my prin
cipal concern is with the lower limit. In both cases I have followed
the same method of experimentation. I constructed a series of ful
minating panes of the same dimensions with dilferent dielectrics; I
charged them successively by putting them for a. given time in com
munication with a source of electricity of constant tension, and in
each case measured the quantity of electricity condensed by the
inducing armature by what I have called the method of gauging.
    Working in this way, I have found that the quantity of electricity
condensed diminishes with the duration of the charge, even when
only small intervals of time are considered. Thus the following
numbers were obtained for the charges of a condenser made of com
mercial stearic acid, the charge of an air-condenser of the same size
being taken as unity :—
                                                  Quantity of electricity
                    Duration of the charge.                 condensed.
                   A fraction of a. second . . . . . . . . . . 1'3
                   2seconds.................... 1'8
                   40secouds ..                                2'7
                   Severalhours.... . . . .                    7'0
    Hence if the conductibility and inductive capacity are two distinct
properties, it will be necessary, in order to eliminate the <U+FB01>rst, to
work more rapidly than I have done. Physicists who have worked
on the inductive capacity have not usually noted the time during
which their condensers were charged. Faraday merely mentions
that he worked rapidly ; but I think that at least three or four seconds
would be needed to execute the manipulation which his method
requires ; and it is indubitable that during this interval conductibility
may manifest its action, since, in the example cited, the quantity of
electricity condensed where the duration of the charge is 2 seconds
is four times as much as with a charge whose duration I estimate at
1—,‘,T,th of a second.
   I have not yet reduced the duration below this fraction of a. second ;
but I consider it certain that in this small interval of time conducti
bility may exert a certain action, and I am led to believe that for
stearic acid the true value of the lower limit of the charges is unity,
which amounts to saying that stearic acid has exactly the same in
ductive capacity as air.
   All the insulating substances I have worked with have not com
ported themselves like stearic acid, and some of the results obtained
appear at <U+FB01>rst to furnish a decisive argument in favour of Faraday’s
theory. Thus, with two fulminating panes of the same size, one of
sulphur and one of stearic acid, I found that the latter exceeds the _
former when the duration of the charge is some seconds, but that
the former decidedly preponderates over the latter when the duration
of the charge is reduced to -1-givth of a second. At <U+FB01>rst sight it seems
impossible to explain this inversion without introducing some pro

 perty distinct from conductibility; but yet it is easy to see that the
 assumption of this new property may be dispensed with, if it be
 assumed that at least one of the dielectrics offers a certain hetero
 geneity of composition or of structure. If we conceive, on the one
 part, a homogeneous dielectric endowed with a. feebly, and on the
 other hand a dielectric composed of a perfectly insulating mass, in
 the midst of which are fragments of another perfectly conducting
 substance, it is easy to see that the second dielectric might exceed
 the <U+FB01>rst when the duration of the charges was su<U+FB01>iciently small, and
 that, on the contrary, the homogeneous dielectric might preponderate
 when the charges are su<U+FB02>iciently prolonged.
     This in<U+FB02>uence of heterogeneity I have been able to demonstrate by
 means of two cakes of <U+FB02>our of sulphur of the same size, one contain
 ing a small quantity of water, and the other a somewhat larger one
 of olive oil. Compared in the same manner as solid discs, I found
 that the disc containing water gave a charge almost double that of
 the other when the duration was only a. fraction of a second, but
 that when the duration was some minutes, the cake impregnated with
  oil gave the greater charge.
     Is it now possible to attribute to sulphur such a heterogeneous
  structure as I describe? The researches of MM. Regnault, Ch. De
 ville, and Berthelot have shown us that this body may undergo
  various modi<U+FB01>cations ; and it appears natural to assume that its elec
  trical properties may vary at the same time as its other properties.
  With specimens of amorphous sulphur and of octahedral sulphur I
  constructed pulverulent cakes which I investigated in the usual man
  ner, and I found that the quantity accumulated by the octahedral
  sulphur-condenser increases with the duration of the charge, and for
  even very small durations is greater than the quantity accumulated
  by an air-condenser of the same dimensions. The charge of a con
  denser constructed of amorphous sulphur does not vary with the time,
  and is exactly equal to the charge of an air-condenser of the same
  dimensions.
      In short, all my investigations on these subjects lead me to believe
  that they would all be affected in the same way by electrical in<U+FB02>u
   ence if they could be completely deprived of their conductibility.
   Hence I think Mr. Faraday’s theory must be modi<U+FB01>ed in one point.
   According to the views of this illustrious physicist. induction and
   conduction are only the two extreme terms of the same mode of pro
   pagation, which in all cases is e<U+FB01>ected by the intervention of the ma
   terial molecules. But it seemed to me quite established by my pre
   ceding researches, that the mathematical laws of transmission are the
   same in the cases of induction and of conduction; but it does not
   therefore follow that these two modes of propagation take place in
   the same medium. 'It appears probable, on the contrary, that elec
   tricity, like heat, may be propagated by the intervention of the aether
   as well as by the intervention of ponderable matter; and I am led to
' believe that in<U+FB02>uence or induction takes place by the <U+FB01>rst of these
   two ways, while conduction employs the second.——C0mptes Rendus,
