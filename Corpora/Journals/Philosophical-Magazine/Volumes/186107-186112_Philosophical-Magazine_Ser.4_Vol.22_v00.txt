  ing current     formed which accelerates the process. The cooling
                  is
is   likewise promoted        by
                            the capacity of the gas to transmit heat (or
  its diathermaney), as well as      its conductibility, assuming that
                                        by
  gases can conduct heat.     Dulong and Petit, in enunciating their
 laws of the loss of heat in their comprehensive memoir Sur                     la

 they could neglect them as being in<U+FB01>nitely small in comparison
 with the in<U+FB02>uence of the ascending current.         Accordingly, since
 the appearance of their memoir,         has been universally assumed
                                             it
 that the differences of cooling in various gases depend on the
 di<U+FB02>'erent mobility of their particles.      This was the more justi
<U+FB01>able, because almost simultaneously with Dulong and Petit’s in
vestigation Sir H. Davy’s celebrated memoir-I- on Flame appeared,
in which he says, “        appears that the property of elastic <U+FB02>uids

stitution of the light gases which makes them capable of with
drawing caloric from these surfaces in a manner different to what
other gases would do, which doubtless depends on the mobility
of their particles.” Such a mobility is met with in other cases.
I   have shown* that hydrogen passes through <U+FB01>ne clefts and
apertures more easily than atmospheric air ; and in fact the
different degree of diffusion in gases mainly depends on their
greater or less readiness to penetrate into capillary apertures.
Along with this difference in the mobility of the particles, which,
as follows from experiments on the transpiration of gases through
narrow apertures, depends on the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the gas,
there may also be a different degree of friction within the gas
itself. It     however, dif<U+FB01>cult to assume that this friction alone
                      is,
occasions the great differences observed on cooling in different
gases.      hope to show in the following pages that the conduc
               I
tibility of heat             by
                      gases exercises an essential in<U+FB02>uence on the
internal cooling.
   In 1792 Count Rumford published memoir on heat-1', in which
                                                             a
he contended that the propagation of heat in gases and vapours
is   only produced by the motion of the gaseous particles, and
that     communication of heat from particle to particle—a con
           a
duction—does not take place in gases.           Subsequently,      the                  in
seventh of his ‘Essays I,’ he has extended his researches to
liquids, and has denied that they possess the property of conduct
ing heat.
     This assertion was soon opposed by John Dalton§, While
 Murray“ and Dr. Thomas Thomson<U+FB02> afterwards endeavoured
to refute            it     by
                    comprehensive investigations.     Biot also**,                           in
 reporting  on  the  memoir  of the latter, observed that  Rumford’s
 experiments only justi<U+FB01>ed the conclusion that liquids conduct
 heat to    very small extent, and not that the property
                 a                                            entirely             is

      Despretz has since shown* that the conduction of heat in
  water follows the laws given by Fourier for its conduction in
  metals.     A eonduetibility of heat in gases has never been ima
  gined to exist.       Although it is in any case very small, it ap
 peared interesting to investigate what in<U+FB02>uence it might exert,
 and whether differences existed in the conductibility of different
 gases; for the department of gases is of especial importance, not
 only for the laws propounded by Dulong and Petit, but also for
 any theory of the nature of heat.
      The more immediate inducement to this investigation was a
 repetition of Grove’st interesting experiment, that a platinum
 wire is less strongly heated by a galvanic current when surrounded
 by hydrogen than when it is in atmospheric air or any other gas.
      On the <U+FB01>rst publication of these experiments,M.Poggendori1' t
 expressed the opinion that they depended on the laws which
 Dulong and Petit had established for the cooling of a body heated
 in the ordinary manner.          Clausins§ has since shown the con
cordance between Grove’s results and. the numbers obtained by
Dulong and Petit.
     In repeating Grove’s experiments,           I  found that hydrogen
exerts its preventive action even when only a ver thin layer
surrounds the platinum wire.            Two very thin, equa ly long pla
tinum wires were enclosed in tubes of             l  millim. diameter, one
 of the   tubes   being  <U+FB01>lled   with atmospheric air and the other with
 hydrogen. On passing the current through both wires in sud:
 cession, the one surrounded by atmospheric air became strongly
 incandescent, while the other did not even reach a red heat.              It
is scarcely necessary to say that the result was always the same,
whichever of the two tubes was <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen.              Even when
the tube <U+FB01>lled with hydrogen was quite horizontal, the wire did
not become incandescent.            As the existence of currents in such
a narrow horizontal tube can scarcely be assumed, it appeared
improbable that the mobility of the particles of hydrogen was
the cause of the strong cooling of the wire.
    It is also iinpossible to conceive why currents produced by
differences of temperature should be stronger in hydrogen than
in other gases. This gas, it is well known, instead of being more,
is even somewhat less expansible than atmospheric air.                Hence
the same differences in temperature produce in hydrogen less
change in the speci<U+FB01>c gravity than in atmospheric air.             But it is
by these changes alone that currents are produced in gases.
Even if the friction of the particles exercises any in<U+FB02>uence, and

 offers a greater hindrance to motion in other gases than in hy
 drogen, still this hindrance is in any case so small as not to
 cancel the in<U+FB02>uences of the greater expansibility of other gases,
 such as carbonic acid or sulphurons acid.
    But if the expansion in hydrogen can produce no stronger
 currents than in other gases, there remains no other assumption
 to explain the more rapid cooling in it than that this gas can
 conduct heat—that       is,
                         can give      from particle to particle, as
 the case with metals—and that            it it
                                         possesses this property in
                                                                                          a is
 higher degree than other gases.      The small density of hydrogen
 militates against this assumption       and

                     a
bulb was in the middle of the tube, while the graduation was
abOVe the cork.     In order to <U+FB01>ll the tube with different gases,
there were two narrow glass tubes <U+FB01>tted into holes near the
thermometer.      Outside the tube they were bent at right angles,
and could be closed      by
                          stopcoeks.     After water had been boiled
in  a capacious  <U+FB02>ask  until  all air had    been expelled, the tube
which had been previously <U+FB01>lled with gas, was introduced into
the <U+FB02>ask, during the ebullition, in such          manner that

 Davy* and others; but they, like Dulong and Petit, introduced
 the heated thermometer into a space which was successively
 <U+FB01>lled with different gases, and observed the times which were
 necessary for the same cooling in these gases.      Currents were
 thereby produced within the gas, which in my experiments
 were very small if not entirely absent, for the tube containing
 the gas was heated almost equally on all sides, above as well as
 below.   But as the times which the thermometer required to
 become heated varied considerably, it appeared probable that
 the heating in the gases was not produced by currents alone,
 but that there was also a propagation of heat from particle to
 particle—in other words, a conduction. Accordingly 1 next made
a series of experiments in which the gases were only heated from
above, and observed the temperatures which a thermometer placed
in them ultimately assumed.       As in this case also the tem
perature   was  always higher  in hydrogen than in other gases,
and was also very di<U+FB02>‘erent in them,               I
                                        was con<U+FB01>rmed in the con
clusion that gases can conduct heat. It might still be objected
that in the heating from above currents were formed, which
caused the di<U+FB01>'erences in temperature.    There was a ready means
of testing this objection. For if gases actually can conduct heat,
the temperature which a thermometer assumes in a space heated
from above, must be lower when the conducting substance is

Under these conditions also the gradual increase of the tempe
rature, up to the maximum, took place in such                    manner that
                                                                        a

temperature.      This concordance furnished proof of the accuracy

   Before turning to    a    few of the conclusions from the numbers
obtained,  it  will be convenient to enter upon the circumstances
which in<U+FB02>uence the maxima of temperature.

    propagated either by radiation alone, or by radiation and con
    duction. The thermometer is indeed protected from direct radia
    tion by the cork screen ; but this screen itself becomes heated by
    a long-continued action of the rays, and then gives part of its
    heat to the thermometer.               I
                                     confess                   I
                                                 at <U+FB01>rst believed that
    the heat transferred in this manner to the thermometer would
    be scarcely perceptible with a screen of 2 millims. thickness, and
    would in any case be less than with a metal screen.      Hence the
    greater part of the ex eriments were made with a cork screen.
    Afterwards, however, i) found that a metal screen, although six
    times as thin as a cork screen, is a better protection against
    radiation. This doubtless depends upon the fact that a metal
    screen absorbs fewer of the rays, and also radiates worse than
    the cork screen ; for when the silvered copper foil was blackened
    on both sides by a tallow candle, the thermometer was heated
    more than by the cork screen.        Hence the metal screen was
    never used blackened.     But whatever the nature of the screen,
    even when it consisted of two metal plates with an interposed
    layer of air, the thermometer after the lapse of a suf<U+FB01>cient time
    always attained an invariable temperature, just as it did when
    without a screen. Other circumstances being the same, this was
    highest when the thermometer was without a screen. In an
    apparatus similar to that represented in ABC, Pl. I. <U+FB01>g. 1,
    but in which the thermometer was somewhat more distant from
    the vessel of boiling water, the temperatures which it indicated
    in atmospheric air under a pressure of 1 atmosphere were as
    follows :—
              2   <U+FB01><U+FB01>imi'<U+FB01>iiii.            1Tlliiiiril’iiiii‘i‘i'.‘

       It might be thought that the temperatures obtained in different
    gases, with the use of different screens, would be proportional to
    one another, since the different screens would absorb propor
‘
    tional quantities of the heat incident upon them, and would again
    part with proportional quantities.      But the result has shown
    that, although these temperatures do follow the same series (that
    is,  ifin one gas the temperature with the use of one screen                     is
    higher than in another,          also higher when another screen

                                    is
    This arises from the fact that, besides the screen, the side of the
    vessel AB'which becomes heated during the experiment, also
    acts on the thermometer.     Although the vessel      surrounded on

 glass in the neighbourhood of C, assumes temperatures which
 are higher than 15° C.     Although the thermometer is protected
 against rays which proceed from the side above, it is directly ex
posed to the rays which come from those parts of the side which
 are lower than the screen. And as these parts of the side receive
more rays when the vessel AB is <U+FB01>lled with a gas which readin
 transmits heat (that        is,
                          with    better-conducting gas) than

   It folIOWs from these numbers that hydrogen really conducts
heat in a manner similar to the metals; for the temperature
which a thermometer placed in it ultimately assumes is higher
as the gas is denser.
   Of all gases this is only the ease with hydrogen, with all the
others the temperature is higher when they are more rare<U+FB01>ed.
It follows therefore that these gases oPpose a hindrance to the
transmission of radiant heat, and that they are athermanous to
such an extent that their athermancy exercises a greater resist
ance than their capacity to conduct heat.        This property ‘is,
however, not entirely ahsent; for, a art from other reasons already
 adduced by Dalton and Blot, which speak for a conductihility of
 heat by gases, it would           be,
                                    contrary to all other known laws                        if
 we assumed thatthe capacity of conducting heat Was, Con<U+FB01>ned                                to
 hydrogen, But       it   is  certainly very remarkable that this gas, the
 lightest    of  all, possesses the reatest conductibility.                   I             _
      This surprising result healed me                 to

 AB in the neighbourhood of                   C  became gradually heated,
it   might be supposed that although the temperature of this side
 decreases from above downwards, yet that “currents are produced
 in the gases contained         inAB, and that the differences of témpe
 rature observed only arise from these currents.             This assumption

   After these results it cannot be doubted that hydrogen con
ducts heat, and that in a higher degree than all other gases.
This is the more unexpected, since although the conductibility is
not directly dependent on the density of bodies (for example, pla
tinum conducts worse than copper or silver), yet the metals, the
densest of all bodies, are the best conductors, and in general the
looser and less dense substances conduct worse than the denser
ones.   If  hydrogen exhibits in this respect a deviation, a new
proof is afforded of that similarity to the metals, so often main
tained from its chemical relations.

      II.        On a supposed Failure of the Calculus of Variations.
                  By G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal't'.

PROFESSOR
    the Calculus                 of Variations, has alluded twice (pages 161
 and 365) to the problem “To construct upon a given base AB
 a curve such that the super<U+FB01>cial area of the surface generated by
 its revolution round A B may be given, and that its solid con
 tent may be a maximum.” The curve found by Professor el                              J
lett’s treatment is a semicircle, and the solid therefore is a sphere.
 On this he remarks, page 365, “ The solution is not given by
the sphere, inasmuch as its super<U+FB01>cial area is a determinate
function of AB [that               is,
                               supposing the sphere of the solution to
have its diameter equal      to and coinciding with AB], and cannot
therefore be made equal to any other given quantity.”          And in
                             “ The method therefore fails altogether.”
page 366 he concludes,
     Mr. Todhunter has cited this solution and remark of Professor

     Isubmit the following solution, as what    believe to be the                  I
real interpretation of the formulae given by the Calculus.    It is
founded upon these three principles :—
   (1) There is nothing to prevent us from accepting as solution
of the problem a discontinuous curve, provided the different parts
meet in a way which is suitable to the conditions of the problem.
Mr. Todhunter in several places has alluded to such disconti
nuity (see pages 19 and 174).
   (2) If, in the solution given immediately by the Calculus of
Variations, we are certain that no accidental or adventitious
factor has been introduced; and if we <U+FB01>ndthat the solution,
expressed under the form                                        Zap-l,

of two factors, then we are bound to consider each of the curves
represented by the two factors as    good and suf<U+FB01>cient solution

of the problem.
   (3) And, to exhibit the solution in its utmost generality, We
must use both the solutions given                            by
                                      these curves, in such com
bination as the circumstances of the problem indicate to be
proper.

before us.

sidercd   as a scienti<U+FB01>c basis for a new classi<U+FB01>cation of the latter.
He objects to the four types admitted by Gerhardt, namely,
hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, water, and ammonia, that they sue,
tain to organic compounds only arti<U+FB01>cial and external relations,
while he conceives that between these and certain other: bodies
there are natural relations having reference to the origin of the
organic species. Starting from the fact that all the bodies of
the carbon series found in the vegetable kingdom are derived
from carbonic acid with the concurrence of water, he proceeds to
show how all the compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen
may be derived from the type of an oxide of $8.?qu which is
either CSI O4, ()2 O’, or the hypothetical C“- Q.
    When in the former we replace one atom of oxygen by one of
hydrogen, we have C‘2 03 H, or anhydrous formic acid ; the re,
placement of a second equivalent would yield C2 Q9 9, or the
 unknown formic aldehyde; a third, CSI 0 B3,the oxide 0, methyle;
 and a fourth, C9 H4, or formene. 'By substituting methyle for
 one or more atoms of hydrogen in the previous formula, we oh
 tain those of the corresponding bodies of the vipic series; and
 it will be readily seen that by introducing the higher alcnha is
 radicals, we may derive from Cit O.“ the formulas of all the elepho ic

   16                  Mr. T. S. Hunt    on the Theory
   and '“iEta, are by Kolbe assimilated to the oxides of ZnO, PbO’,
   and mm.
      Ad.Wurtz, in the Répertoire de Chimie Pure for October
   1860, has given an analysis of Kolbe’s memoir (to which, not
   having the original before me,     I am indebted for the preceding
   sketch), and   follows it by a judicious criticism.        While Kolbe
  adopts as types a. number of mineral species, including the
  oxides of carbon, of sulphur and the metals, Wurtz would main
  tain but three, hydrogen (11’), water (H‘2 09), and ammonia
  (N H3); and these three types, as he endeavoured to show in
  1855, represent different degrees of condensation of matter.
  The molecule of hydrogen, He (M9), corresponding                 to four
  volumes, combines with two volumes of oxygen (09) to form
  four volumes of water, and may thus be regarded as condensed
  to one-half in its union with oxygen, and derived from a double
  molecule, Mit M“.      In like manner four volumes of ammonia
  contain two volumes of nitrogen and six of hydrogen, which,
  being reduced to one-third, correspond to a triple molecule,
  Ma Ma, so that these three types and their multiples are redu
 cible to that of hydrogen more or less condensed *.
     As regards the rejection of water as a type of organic com
 pounds, and the substitution of carbonic acid, founded upon the
 consideration that these in nature are derived from C2 O‘, Wurta
 has well remarked that water, as the source of hydrogen, is
 equally essential to their formation, and indeed that the carbonic
 anhydride, C“ 0“, like all other anhydrous acids, may be regarded
 as a simple derivative of the water type.       Having then adopted
 the notion of referring a great variety of bodies to a mineral
 species of imple constitution, water is to be preferred to carbonic
 anhydride,—-<U+FB01>rst, because we can compare with it many mineral
 compounds which can with dif<U+FB01>culty be compared with carbonic
 acid; and secondly, because, the two atoms of water being
replaceable singly, the mode of derivation of a great number
 of compounds (acids, alcohols, ethers, &c.) is much more sim
 ple and natural than from carbonic acid.            As “’urtz happily
remarks, Kolbe has so fully adopted the theory of types, that he
wishes to multiply them, and even admits condensed types, which
are, however, molecules of carbonic acid, and not of water;
                                                                     “ he
combats the types of Gerhardt, and at the same time counterfeits
them.”
    Thus far we are in accordance with M. Wurtz, who has shown
himself one of the ablest and most intelligent expounders of
this doctrine of molecular types, as above de<U+FB01>ned, now almost
universally adopted by chemists.          He writes, “To my mind
this idea of referring to water, taken as a type, a very great

number of compounds, is one of the most beautiful conceitl ions
of modern chemistry* ; ” and again, he declares the idea of
regarding both water and ammonia as representatives of the
hydrogen type, more or less condensed, to be so simple and so
general in its application, that it is worthy “ to form the basis of
a system of chemistry-la”
   \Ve have in this theory two important conceptions: the <U+FB01>rst
is that of hydrogen and water regarded as types to which both
mineral and organic compounds may be referred; and the
second is the notion of condensed and derived types, according
to which we not only assume two or three molecules of hydrogen
or water as typical forms, but even look on water as the deriva
tive of hydrogen, which is itself the primal type.
   As to the history of these ideas, Wurtz remarks that the pro
position enunciated by Kolbe, that all organic bodies are derived
by substitution from mineral compounds, is not new, but has been
 known in the science for about ten years. “ Williamson was the
<U+FB01>rst who said that alcohol, ether, and acetic acid were comparable
to water—organic waters. Hofmann and myself had already com
pared the compound ammonias to ammonia itself. * * * * *
To Gerhardt belongs the merit of generalizing these ideas, of
developing them, and supporting them with his beautiful dis
covery of anhydrous monobasic acids.            Although he did not
introduce into the science the idea of types, which belongs to
M. Dumas, he gave it a new form, which is expressed and essen
tially reproduced by the proposition of Kolbe.             Gerhardt re
duced all organic bodies to four types—hydrogen, hydrochloric
acid, water, and ammoniaI.”
    The historical inaccuracies of the above quotation are the
more surprising, since in March 1854 I published in the Ame
rican Journal of Science (vol. xvii. p. 194) a concise account of
the progress of these views.       This paper was republished in the
‘Chemieal Gazettc’ (1854, p. 181), and copies of it were by
myself placed in the hands of most of the distinguished chemists
of England, France, and Germany.                           I
                                            In this paper have shown
that the germ of the idea of mineral types is to be found in an
essay of Auguste Laurent§, where he showed that alcohol may
be looked upon as water (H2 0‘) in which ethyle replaces one
atom of hydrogen, and hydric ether as the result of a complete
 substitution of the hydrogen by a second atom of ethyle.          Hence
 he observed that while ether is neutral, alcohol is monobasic and
the type of the monobasic vinic acids, as water is the type of

18                      Mr. T. S. Hunt     on the Theory
bibasic acids.        In extending and developing this idea of Lau
rent’s,    I insisted in March 1848, and again in January 1850,
upon the relation between the alcohols and water as one of ho
mology, water being the <U+FB01>rst term in the series, and H9 being
in like manner the homologue of acetone and formcne, while
the bases of Wurtz were said to “sustain to their corresponding
                                                                          '
alcohols the same relation that ammonia does to water*.”
    In a notice of his essay, published in September 18481",                     I
endeavoured to show that Laureut’s view might be further ex
tended, so as to include in the type of water “all those saline
combinations (acids) which contain owygen ;" and in a paper read
before the American Association for the Advancement of Science
at Philadelphia, in September 1848,            I  further suggested that as
many      neutral    oxygenized compounds which do not possess a
saline character are derivatives of acids which are referable to
the type H9 0’, “we may regard all oxygenized bodies as belong
ing to this type,” which         I further showed in the same essay is
but a derivative of the primal type H“, to which I referred all
hydrocarbons and their chlorinized derivatives, as also the vola
tile alkaloids, which were regarded “as amidized species” of
the hydrocarbons, in which the residue amidogcn, N H*, re
placed an atom of H or C1, or what is equivalent, the residue
N H was substituted for O” in the corresponding alcoholsI.
    In the paper published in September 1848,                   I showed that
while water is bihasic, the acids which, like hypochlorous and
nitric acid, were derived from it by a simple substitution of Cl
and NO4 for H, were necessarily monobasic ; and                 I then pointed
out the possible existence of the nitric anhydride (NO“)‘2 09,
which was soon after discovered by Deville. Gerhardt at this
time denied the existence of anhydridcs of the monobasic acids,
while be regarded anhydrides as characteristic of polybasic acids,
and indeed was only led to adopt my views by the discovery of
the very anhydrides whose formation             I  had foreseen §.
    In explaining      the  origin  of bibasic  acids,  I described them as
produced by the replacement, in a second equivalent of water, of
an atom of hydrogen by a monobasic saline group; thus sul
phuric acid would be (S’ H06 H) 09‘. Tribasic acids, in like
manner, are to be regarded as derived from a third equivalent of

water, and becomes an anhydride, as C" H2 O“--II2 O"=C2 0‘. So that
both classes of anhydrides are to be referred to the type of one molecule

The idea of polymeric types was further illustrated in the same
paper, where three hydrogen types were proposed, (HH), (HQHQ),
and (H8113), corresponding to the chlorides MC], MCla, and
MCI”. It was also illustrated by sulphur in its ordinary state,
          I
which showed is to be regarded as a triple molecule 83 (or 86:4
volumes), and referred sulphurous acid S09 to this type, to which
also probably belongs selenic oxide.              (At the same time    I sug.
gested that the odorant form of oxygen or ozone was possibly 03.)
“'urtz, in his memoir published in 1855, adopts my view, and
makes sulphur vapour at 400° C. the type of the triple molecule.
I   further suggested* that gaseous nitrogen is NN, an anhy
dride amide or nitryle, corresponding to nitrite of ammonia,
(N03, NH“ O) — H4 O4=NN. This view a late writer attributes
to Gerhardt, who adopted it from met.                May not nitrogen gas,
as   I  have elsewere   suggested, regenerate under certain conditions
ammonia and a nitrite, and thus explain not only the frequent
formation of ammonia in presence of air and reducing agents,
but certain cases of nitri<U+FB01>cationI ?
     I  endeavoured still further to show that hydrogen is to be
looked upon as the fundamental type, from which the water type
is derived by the replacement of an atom of H by the residue
HOQ§.        1n the same way      I regarded ammonia as water in which
the residue NH replaced 0“.
      I have always protested against the view which regards the
 so-called rational formulae as expressing in any way the real
 structure of the bodies which are thus represented.               These for
 mulae are invented to explain a certain class of reactions, and we
 may construct, from other points of view, other rational formulae
 which are equally admissible.           As I- have elsewhere said, “the
 various hypotheses of copulates and radicals are based upon the
 notion of dualism, which has no other foundation than the ob.
 served order of generation, and can have no place in a theory of

     I  The formation of a nitrite in the experiments of Cloez appears to be
independent of the presence of ammonia, and to require only the elements
of air and water (Comples Rendus, vol. lxi. p. 135). Some experiments now
in progress lead me to conclude that the appearance of a nitrite in the
various processes for ozone is due to the power of nascent oxygen to de
 stroy by oxidation the ammonia generated by the action of water on ni
 trogen, the nitrous nitrer ; so that the odour and many of the reactions
 assigned to ozone or nascent oxygen are really due to the nitrous acid
 which is set free when the former encounters nitrogen and moisture.       On
 the other hand, nascent hydrogen, which readily reduces nitrates and ni
 trites to ammonia, by destroying the regenerated nitrite of the nitryle,
 produces ammonia in many cases from atmospheric nitrogen.

20                    Mr. T. S. Hunt   on the Theory
science.”       All
                 chemical changes are reducible to union (iden
ti<U+FB01>cation), and division (di<U+FB01>‘erentiation). When in these changes
only one species is concerned, we designate the process as meta
morphosis,which is either by condensation or by expansion (homo
geneous differentiation).    In metagenesis, on the contrary, un
like species may unite, and by a subsequent heterogeneous dif
ferentiation give rise to new species, constituting what is called
double decomposition, the results of which, differently inter
preted, have given origin to the hypothesis of radicals and the
notion of substitution by residues, to express the relations be
tween the parent bodies and their progeny.      The chemical his
tory of bodies is then a record of their changes; it       in fact,
                                                             is,
their genealogy; and in making use of typical formula; to indi
cate the derivation of chemical species, we should endeavour
to show the ordinary modes of their generation *.
   Keeping this principle in mind, let us now examine the theory
of the formation of acids.     As we have just seen,     I taught in
1848 that    the monobasic, bibasic, and  tribasic acids are derived
respectively from one, two, and three molecules of water, H‘2 0’.
M. Wurtz, seven years later (in 1855), put forth similar view.
                                                        a
He supposes      monatomic radical PC“,
                 a                           adiatomic radical P03",
and   a triatomic radical POQ'", replacing respectively one, two,
and three atoms of hydrogen in HQ 03, H4 0‘, and H6 06, thus
(PO‘<U+FB02> H) 09, (POM H2) 04, and (POW H3) 06.            These radicals
evidently correspond   to PO5  which  has  lost  one, two, and three
atoms of oxygen     in reacting upon   the  hydrogen    of the water
type; and these acids may be accordingly represented as formed
 by the substitution of the residue PO5—O for H, 81.0.
   To this manner of representing the generation of polybasic
acids we object that       encumbers the science with numerous
                               it
hypothetical radicals, and that       moreover fails to show the
                                     it

    Gerhardt long since maintained that we cannot distinguish
between polybasic salts and what are called subsalts, which are
as truly neutral salts of a‘ particular type.         Thus the bibasic and
tribasic phosphates are to be looked tipon as subsalts which
sustain the same relation to the monobasic phosphates that the
basic nitrates bear to the neutral nitrates.           He succeeded in pre

    Without counting the still more basic sulphates of zinc and
copper, described by Kane and Schindler, we have the following
salts, which, in accordance with Wurtz's notation, correspond to
the annexed radicals :—
        1.  Unibasic             .   .  S52 1107   :89 O5     monatomic.
        2.  Bibasic . .      .    .  .  S2 H9 08   =S2    O4  diatomic.
        3.  Quadribasic      .   .   .  S52 H4  0'0:  S"2 O?  tetratomic.
        4.  Sexbasic     .   .    .  .  S’ H6   O":   Si      hexatomic.
        5.  Octobasie.   .   .       .  Sa H8   0“:   39—09 octatomic.
     It is easy to apply a similar reduclio ad absurdum to the ra
 dical theory in the case of the oxychlorides and other basic salts,
 and to show that the radicals of the dualists are often merely
 algebraic expressions. (See further my remarks in the American
 Journal of Science, vol. vii. pp. 1102-4041:)

  process as it takes place in nature, dispenses alike with hypo
  thetical radicals and residues, both of which are, however, con
  venient for the purposes of notation.       In the selection of a
  typical form, to which a great number of species may be referred,
  hydrogen or water merits the preference from its simplicity, and
  from the important part which it plays in the generation of
  species.   Vl'ater and carbonic anllydridc are both so directly
  concerned in the generation of the bodies in the carbon series,
  that either may be assumed as the type; but we prefer to
  regard C52 0", like the other anhydridcs, as only a derivative of
  the type of water, and eventually of the hydrogen type.
     These views were <U+FB01>rst put forward by myself in 1848, when
 I   expressed the opinion that they were destined to form “the
  basis of a true natural system of chemical classi<U+FB01>cation ;” and it
  was onl after having opposed them for four years to those of
  Gerhardlt, that this chemist, in June 1852, renounced his views,
 and without any acknowledgment        adopted my own*.       Already
 in 1851, Williamson, in a paper read before the British Associa
 tion, had developed the ideas on the water type to which W urtz
 refers above; and to him the English editor of Gmelin’s ‘ Hand
 book’ ascribes the theory.     The notion of condensed ty es, and
                                                         I
 of H‘2 as the primal type, was not, so far as am aware, rought
 forward by either of these, and remained unnoticed until resus
 citated by Wurtz in 1855, seven years after         I
                                                had <U+FB01>rst announced
 it, and one year after my reclamation, published in the American
Journal of Science, in March 1854.
     My claims have not, however, been overlooked        Dr VVoleott
                                                                  by
Gibbs.     In an essay on the polyaeid bases, he remarks that in
a   previous paper he had attributed the theory of water types to
Gerhardt and Williamson, and adds, “ In this <U+FB01>nd have not    I     I
done justice to Mr. T. Sterry Hunt, to whom          exclusively due
                                                             is
the credit of having <U+FB01>rst applied the theory to the so-called
oxygen acids and to the anhydrides, and in whose earlier papers
may be found the germs of most of the ideas on classi<U+FB01>cation
usually attributed to Gerhardt and his disciples-In” It will be
seen, from what precedes, that       not only applied the theory, as
                                      I
Dr. Gibbs remarks, but, except       so far as Laurent’s suggestion
 goes, invented     and published
                   it                   in all its details some years

                    I
justice to the memory of Auguste Laurent, and will ascribe to
whom     it  due the credit of having given to the science theory

for    by  Daniel Bernoulli, partially given                    by

    2. To simplif my references to the mathematical prop0sitions
of this theory,     Iyshall commence             by
                                              laying down the following
de<U+FB01>nitions :—
    qu. 1.     A   simple harmonic function                function which
                                                               is    a
varies  as  the sine   or cosine  of the  independent variable, or of an
angle varying in simple proportion with the independent vari
able.    The harmonic curve            the well-known name applied to
                                           is
the graphic representation, on the ordinary Cartesian system, of
what  I   am now de<U+FB01>ning as           simple harmonic function.

the form of     a string vibrating in such         manner as to give the
                                                          a
simplest and smoothest possible character of sound; and, in this
case, the displacement of each particle of the string                   har   is   a
monic function of the time, besides being               harmonic function
                                                               a
of the distance of its position of equilibrium from either end
of the string. The sound in this case may be called                  perfect  a
unison.

function <U+FB01>rst acquires a maximum value.       The augmentation of

  3.     Composition and Resolution                of Simple Harmonic Functions
of one   Period.
    Prop. The sum of any two simple harmonic functions of one
period is equal to one simple harmonic function whose amplitude
is the diagonal of a parallelogram described upon lines drawn
from one point to lengths equal to the amplitudes of the given
 functions, at angles measured from a <U+FB01>xed line of reference
 equal to their epochs, and whose epoch is the inclination of the
same diagonal to the same line of reference.
    Cor. 1. If A, A’ be the amplitudes of two simple harmonic
functions of equal period, and s, 6' their epochs, that is to say,
if A cos (mt—e), A' cos (mt—6') be two simple harmonic func
 tions, the one simple harmonic function equal to their sum has
 for its amplitude and its epoch the following values respect
ively :—

period, added together, are equivalent to single harmonic func

tion of which the amplitude and epoch are derived from the ampli
tude and epochs of the given functions, in the same manner as
the magnitude and inclination to a <U+FB01>xed line of reference, of the
resultant of any number of forces in one plane, are derived from
the magnitudes and the inclinations to the same line of reference
of the given forces.
    Cor. 3. The physical principle of the superposition of sounds
being admitted, any number of simple unisons of one period co
existing, produce one simple unison of the same period, of which
the intensity (measured by the square of the amplitude) and the
epoch are determined in the manner just speci<U+FB01>ed.
    Car. 4. The sum of any number of simple harmonic functions
of one period vanishes for every argument, if it vanishes for any
two arguments not differing by a semicircumference, or by some
multiple of a semicireumference.
    Cor. 5. The co-existence of perfect unisons may constitute
perfect silence.
    Car. 6. A simple harmonic function of any epoch may be
resolved into the sum of two whose epochs are respectively zero
and a quarter period, and whose amplitudes are respectively
equal to the value of the given function for the arguments zero
and a quarter period respectively.
   4. Complex Harmonic Functions—Harmonic functions of dif
ferent periods added can never produce a simple harmonic func
tion. If their periods are commensurable, their sum may be
called a complex harmonic function.
    Cor. A complex harmonic function is the proper expression
for a perfect harmony in music.
   5. Ezpressibility of Arbitrary Functions by Trigonometrical
series.
   Prop. A complex harmonic function, with a constant term
added, is the proper expression, in mathematical language, for
any arbitrary periodic function.

Arbitrary Function—Any arbitrary periodic function whatever
being given, the amplitudes and epochs of the terms of a com.

value of the independent variable, may be investigated by the

 not appreciably influenced by the general curvature, and sensibly
  agreeing with what would be produced if the surface were an
 in<U+FB01>nite plane, except insofar as they are modi<U+FB01>ed 'by super<U+FB01>cial
 irregularities. Hence Fourier’s formulae for an in<U+FB01>nite solid,
 bounded on one side by an in<U+FB01>nite plane, of which the tempera
 ture is made to vary arbitrarily, contain the proper analysis for
 diurnal or annual variations of terrestrial temperature, unless a
 theory of the effect of inequalities of surface (upon which no in
 vestigator has yet ventured) is aimed at.
    9. The effect of diurnal variations of temperature becomes
 insensible at so small a distance below the surface, that in most
 localities irregularities of soil and drainage must prevent any very
 satisfactory theoretical treatment of their inward progression and
 extinction from being carried out.           At depths exceeding three
 feet  below   the  surface,  all periodic   effects of daily variations of
 temperature become insensible in most soils, and the observable
 changes are those due to a daily average, varying from day to
 day.     If now the annual variation of temperature were truly
 periodic,   a  complex harmonic function could be determined to
represent for all time the temperature at three feet or any greater
depth.      But in reality the annual variation is very far from
 recurring in a perfectly periodic manner, since there are both
 great differences in the annual average temperatures, and never
 ceasing irregularities in the progress of the variation within each
 year.     A full theory of the consequent variations of temperature
 propagated       downwards,      must include the consideration          of
non-periodic changes ; but the most convenient <U+FB01>rst step is
 that which     I propose to take in the present communication, in
which the average annual variations for groups of years will be
 discussed according to the laws to which periodic variations are
subject.
    10. The method which Fourier has given for treating this and
other similar problems is founded on the principle of the inde
pendent superposition of thermal conductions.                This principle
holds rigorously     in  nature, except insofar as the conductivity or
amount at a depth of 25 French feet, and is scarcely sensible at a depth of
50 French feet (being there reduced, in such rock as that of Calton Hill,
to 76,7).   Hence, at a depth of 50,000 French feet, or about ten English
miles, a variation having one million years for its period would be reduced
to 3%,. If the period were ten thousand million years, the variation would
similarly be reduced to I)”; at 1000 miles’ depth, and would be to some
appreciable extent affected by the spherical <U+FB01>gure of the whole earth,
although to only a very small extent, since there would be comparatively but
very little change of                    than 3‘6 of the super<U+FB01>cial amount)

the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the conducting substance may vary with the
changes of temperature to which it is subjected ; and it may be
accepted with very great con<U+FB01>dence in the case with which we
are now concerned, as it is not at all probable that either the
conductivity or the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the rock or soil can vary at all
sensibly under the in<U+FB02>uence of the greatest changes of tempera
ture experienced in their natural circumstances ; and, indeed, the
only cause we can conceive as giving rise to sensible change in
these physical qualities is the unequal percolation of water, which
we may safely assume to be con<U+FB01>ned in ordinary localities to
 depths of less than three feet below the surface.     The particular
mode of treatment which          I
                              propose  to apply  to the present sub
ject consists in expressing the temperature at any depth as a
complex harmonic function of the time, and considering each
term of this function separately, according to Fourier’s formulae
for the case of a simple harmonic variation of temperature, pro
pagated inwards from the surface.       The laws expressed by these
formulae may be stated in general terms as follows.
    11. Fourier’s Solution stated*.—If the temperature at any
point of an in<U+FB01>nite plane, in a solid extending in<U+FB01>nitely in all
directions, be subjected to a simple harmonic variation, the tem
perature throughout the solid on each side of this plane will
follow everywhere according to the simple harmonic law, with
epochs retarded equally, and with amplitudes diminished in a
constant proportion for equal augmentations of distance.         The
retardation of epoch expressed in circular measure (are divided
by radius) is equal to the diminution of the Napierian logarithm
of  the amplitude; and the amount of each per unit of distance
is equal to
               “7%;     if   cdenote the capacity for heat of a unit bulk
of the substance, and k its conductivity            1'.
   12. Hence,    the complex harmonic functions expressing the

varying temperature at two different depths be determined, and
each term of the <U+FB01>rst be compared with the corresponding term
of the second, the value of     \/      31%
                                              may be determined   either   by
dividing the difference of the Napierian logarithms of the ampli
tudes, or the difference of the epochs         by
                                         the distance between the
points. The comparison of each term in the one series with the

     1‘   is to say, the quantity of heat conducted per unit of time across
a unit area of a  plate of unit thickness, with its two surfaces permanently
maintained at temperatures differing by unity.

 80             Prof. W. Thomson      on the Reduction   of
 corresponding    term in the other series gives us, therefore, two
 determinations    of the value of
                                    \/        which should
fectly, if (1) the data were perfectly accurate, if
                                                              agree per

mal surfaces throughout ware parallel planes, and if (3) the
speci<U+FB01>c heat and conductivity of the soil were everywhere and
 always constant.
     As these conditions are not strictly ful<U+FB01>lled in any natural
application, the <U+FB01>rst thing to be done in working out the theory
is to test how far the different determinations agree, and to judge
accordingly of the applicability of the theory in the circumstances.
If the test thus afforded prove satisfactory, the value of the con.
ductivity in absolute measure may be deduced from the result
with the aid of a separate experimental determination of the
speci<U+FB01>c heat.
     13. The method thus described differs from that followed by
Professor Forbes, in substituting the separate consideration of
separate terms of the complex harmonic function for the exami,
nation of the whole variation unanalyscd, which he conducted
according to the plan laid down by Poisson.
    This plan consists in using the formulae for a simple harmonic
variation, as approximately applicable to the actual variation.
At great depths the amplitudes of the second and higher terms
of the complex harmonic function become so much reduced as
not sensibly to in<U+FB02>uence the variation, which is consequently
there expressed with sufficient accuracy by a single harmonic
term of yearly period ; but at even the greatest depths for which
continuous observations have actually been made, the second (or
semi’annual) term has a very sensible in<U+FB02>uence, and the third
and fourth terms are by no means without effect on the varia
tions at three feet and six feet from the surface.       A close agree.
ment with theory is therefore not to be expected, until the me
thod of analysis which      I  now propose is applied.        It may be
added that in the theoretical reductions hitherto made, either
by Professor Forbes or others, the amplitudes of the variations
for the different depths have alone been compared, and the very
interesting conclusion of theory, as to the relation between the
absolute amount of retardation of phase and the diminution of
amplitude for any increase of depth, has remained untested.

     The semi-annual terms in these equations present so great
irregularities (those for the Calton l-lill station, for instance,
showing a greater amplitude at 6 feet depth than at 3 feet), that
no satisfactory result can be obtained by including them in the
theoretical discussion on which we are now about to enter. \Ve
shall see later, however, that when an average for the whole period
of eighteen years for the Calton Hill station is taken, the semi
annual terms are, for the 3 feet and 6 feet depths, in fair agree
ment with theory ; and for the two greater depths are as small as
i necessary for the veri<U+FB01>cation of the theory, and so small as not
to be much in<U+FB02>uenced by errors of observation and of reduction,

equal,       if the conditions of uniformity supposed in the theoretical
solution were ful<U+FB01>lled. The discrepancies are, with the excep
tion of one of the numbers for Craigleith Quarry, on the whole
small; smaller, indeed, than might be expected when the very
notable deviations of the true circumstances from the theoretical
conditions are considered.    The mean results over the 21 feet,
shown in the last line, present very remarkable agreements,-—-the
numbers derived from amplitudes being identical with that
derived from epochs for the Calton Hill station, while the dif
ferences between the corresponding numbers for the two other
stations are in each case only about three per cent.      Taking

slightly differing numbers derived from amplitudes and from

               contemporary meteorological reports from numerous
WHEN     stations are printed one after another in a column (such
as we may see in newspapers and certain foreign publications),
they present no picture to the reader’s mind.      Lists of this de
scription are therefore insuf<U+FB01>cient to do more than supply data
which meteorological students must protract as they best can,
upon a map, in some notation intelligible to themselves, at a
considerable expense of labour and artistic skill.
   It is needless to enlarge upon the serious obstacle which the
necessity of doing this opposes to the pursuit of meteorology.
It has suf<U+FB01>ced to convert what might be a very popular science
into a laborious and dif<U+FB01>cult study. we require means of print
ing, not lists of dry <U+FB01>gures, but actual charts which should record
meteorological observations pictorially and geographically, with
out sacri<U+FB01>cing detail.   It is then in the belief that an attempt                 I
have just made to supply this desideratum might interest some

 rent: thus,    D    means wind from the west.         An included spot
 3,0r line 3, or        cross  3,   respectively signify that the wind
 is gentle, moderate, or strong ; where neither dot, line, nor cross
 are inserted, the force of the wind is unknown.         Thermometrical
 data are expressed by <U+FB01>gures, printed below the wind symbols.
 The <U+FB01>rst two <U+FB01>gures of each set stand for the height of the ordi
 nary thermometer, and the last <U+FB01>gure (in a different type) for
 the difference between this and the thermometer with a wetted
 bulb. To save confusion of <U+FB01>gures, barometer heights are not
inserted on the face of the present map; but lines of equal bar0~
metric pressure have been deduced from the existing observations,
and the places where lines corresponding to each integral one
tenth of an inch cut the marginal columns, have been marked.
Thus a straight line joining the pair of <U+FB01>gures, 29-7, is approxi
mately the line of that pressure.
    I do not consider the types here employed as forming a com
plete series.    An additional shade for cloud is especially wanted.
    It will be observed that no space would be lost by this mode
of representation, supposing we possessed observations corre
sponding to every type space of the map.

                      Lustre.             By Prof. O. N. R001),     Troy*.             of
       the Farbenle/zre, p. 177, Prof. Dove writes, “ In every
IN    case where a surface appears lustrous, there      always                                      is              a
transparent or translucent re<U+FB02>ecting stratum of minor intensity,
through which we see another body.           therefore externally         It     is
                 "     From Silliman’s American Journal for May 1861.

  re<U+FB02>ected    light in combination with         internally  re<U+FB02>ected or
 dispersed    light, whose combined action        produces the idea of
  lustre.”
     Thus by c0mbining in the stereoscope two projections of a
 pyramid, one drawn in black lines on a white ground, the other
 in white lines on black ground, Dove found that the pyramid
 appeared lustrous as though made of graphite.                [To me it
 recalls rather the idea of highly polished glass.]        He found also
 that a yellow and blue surface, when combined in the stereoscope
 and viewed through a plate of violet glass, produced, in the act
 of combination, the idea of a polished metal.
     Similar to Dove’s theory of lustre is that of Prof. Reute*.
     This view of the nature of lustre opens to us the possibility
 of reproducing by the stereoscopic combination of suitably
 coloured    urfaces, the individual lustre and appearance of gold,
 copper, brass, &c.; it also affords us a means of examining
 separately the components which may produce the appearances
peculiar to each.
    1.  I combined inlthe stereoscope on white or on black grounds,
a piece of tinfoil one inch square with a piece of yellow paper
of the same size. The value of the tint on the chromatic circles
of Chevreul was, 1st circle, orange-yellow, No. 4. When the
<U+FB01>eld containing the tinfoil was somewhat shaded by the hand
or otherwise, the surface seen in the stereoscope could not be
distinguished from gold-leaf. The union of the images took
place as readily and the illusion was as strong with persons un
accustomed to the use of the instrument.
    2. By combining in the same way tinfoil with orange-tinted
paper (1st circle, orange),the lustre and appearance of copper is
imitated.
    3. Tinfoil in the act of combination with Nos. 14! and 15 of
the red and black scale imitate bismuth.
    4. Tinfoil or silver-foil in the act of combination with ultra
marine paper appears scarcely blue, rather black like foliated
                                                                       '
     phite.
    5. Gold-leaf in combination with paper of a tint nearly that
of the green of the 1st circle imitated murexide.
    6. Gold-leaf in combination with ultramarine paper resembled
a surface of graphite.
    Upon substituting dark grey paper for the tinfoil the same
effects in degree were not produced, owing, as it seemed to me,
to the fact that the well-known texture and appearance of the
paper forcing itself on the attention, precluded the idea of any
thing metallic.       To remove this dif<U+FB01>culty I employed two
means    :—

      1.    A
            crumpled sheet of tinfoil was photographed, and from
 the negative, prints were taken by the “ ammonia-nitrate pro
 cess,” which were tuned to the so-called black of the photo
 graphers.       This furnished dark paper upon whose surface was
 an accurate drawing of the irregularities characteristic of me
 tallic foil ,- the surface of the paper was of course wholly with
                                            '
out lustre.
    (a) Upon combining, in black or white <U+FB01>elds, a square inch
 of one of those photographs with the above-mentioned yellow
 paper, and shading the photograph a little, a representation of
 gold was obtained but little inferior to that given by the use of
the real tinfoil.
        This photographic paper in combination with orange paper
      (b)
 (1st circle, orange) made an imitation of metallic copper.
        The ultramarine paper in combination with the photo
      (c)
 graph of tinfoil gave         astriking imitation of foliated graphite.
 The blue colour     is perceived much less than would be expected.
   2. The surface of plate of brass
                           a                    inch square was polished,

and. then rather heavily scratched               by coarse <U+FB01>le.
                                                      a           Into the
scratches        a small amount of yellow or white oil paint was
rubbed, and upon this prepared surface dark grey or black
paper was laid, and the whole submitted to the action of a press
as in copper-plate        printing.    By this means        drawing of a
                                                            a
scratched metallic surface was transferred              to paper.    These
markings       serve also  to  enable   the   observer  much   more  easily
to direct his attention simultaneously to the two impressions
presented.
     (a) Upon combining dark grey paper (black and white scale,
 Nos. 18, 19, 20) prepared in this way with the above-mentioned
 yellow paper, the appearance of      polished, scratched plate of
                                             a
 gold was obtained.
    (6) When these dark prepared papers were combined with
 yellow paper coloured         by
                           gamboge (yellow and black scale, No. 9),
 the
  '   appearance and lustre of brass were obtained.
    According to Dove’s theory the darker surface in the stereo
 scope represents the dispersed light, the brighter, that regularly
reflected.   As the polish of   metallic surface
                                         a           proportional to
                                                           is
 the smallness in amount of the light       disperses, we should be
                                                 it
led to expect that      varying the shade of the black paper, we
                          by
should be able to alter the apparent degree of polish of these
imitated metallic surfaces.
    This     the case: yellow paper
            is                            st circle, orange-yellow
                                                 (1
No. 4), in combination with black (No. 21), gives the idea of              a
very highly polished golden surface; as we descend in the scale,
the lustre and resemblance to polished metal regularly dimi
nishes till at grey, No.      almost no effect like gold
                                    8,                        to be   is
perceived.

                      with Dove’s Theory of Lustre.                      41
    On the other hand, by diminishing the brightness of the
 yellow paper, the black tint remaining constant, the idea of a
 polished golden plate in the shade, or so placed as to re<U+FB02>ect the
 image of some dark object, is produced.          Thus we may descend
through the circles of Chevreul to the 7th, when by combining
 the orange-yellow of that circle with No. 21 of the grey scale,
 the idea of a golden plate much shaded is produced.                 I con
 structed tables expressing the effects produced by varying the
 intensity of the two components; but it is not worth while to
 introduce them here.
    As we are accustomed to see gold tinted variously from nearly
 a yellow as in gold-leaf, to almost a copper hue as in some spe
 cimens of our American coin, so the tint of the paper placed in
 the stereoscope may be varied within certain limits, without
 greatly affecting the results.
    Prof. Helmholtz, in his admirable work on Physiological
 Optics*, mentions that by a peculiar arrangement he was able to
cause the homogeneous golden-yellow light of the spectrum to
appear brown, proving thus~that the tint brown is only weak
yellow light.       These stereoscopic experiments give us, on the
other hand, the means of apparently converting brown into a
metallic golden yellow; for many specimens of even brown
wrapping paper, when combined in the stereoscope with very
black prepared paper, acquire the lustre and appearance of yellow
plates in the shade, and re<U+FB02>ecting images of dark objects.
    In the same manner, and corresponding to the investigations
of Helmholtz, I found that the stereoscopic union of black
glazed paper with red (No. 14-, red and black scale), imitated
with surprising perfection the appearance of a glazed plate of
chocolate.
    The chromatic      scales of Chevreul furnish us with a ready
means     of combining in rapid succession in the stereoscope a
great number of de<U+FB01>nite tints; thus by cutting in a card-board
two parallel apertures 1'},- inch broad and 1 inch long, their
distance apart being 2'6 inches, and pasting under one of them
black prepared paper, the other can be brought over any de
sired tint and the effect noted.
    1. In this way I found that a pretty good representation of
the appearance of slightly tarnished lead was produced by the
stereoscopic union of grey No. 18 and No. '4 on the blue-violet
and black scale.
    2. A somewhat inferior imitation of antimony was given by
No. 1 blue and black scale, with grey Nos. 18 to 20, or by using
No. 17 blue and black scale with white.

       4. Ultramarine paper, with some of the lighter violet-blues,
    gave an imitation of blue glass. The idea of blue polished glass
   was also obtained by using in combination with the ultramarine
    paper No. 1 of the yellow and black scale.
       I will mention here that the stereoscopic union of this blue
   with yellow paper, never induced in my mind the idea of green.
       I made some experiments to ascertain how far the stereoscopic
   mixture of two masses of different coloured light corresponded
   to their true mixture by the method of rapid rotation, use being
   made of the imitations above described.      It is however so di<U+FB01>i~

   the results obtained; in many cases a certain moderate amount
   of agreement in the resultant tints was observed. Briieke found,
  when a deeply-coloured yellow glass was held before one eye
  and a blue cobalt glass before the other, that a landscape viewed
  through this combination was simply darkened in appearance.
  I  repeated this experiment with similar glasses, and obtained a.
  like result; objects appeared darkened, but in their natural
  colours, though sometimes the blue or yellow tint predominated
  a little.   But when I presented to a single eye these two masses
  of light, a very different result was obtained; the plates of glass
  were attached to a blackened disk opposite suitable perforations,
  and it was set in rapid rotation; a landscape viewed through it
  appeared deep purple, though not a trace of this colour was to
  be perceived in the binocular use of these glasses.
      When these two glasses were held before the same eye, a
 landscape viewed through them was very much darkened but
 scarcely coloured.
                Sir David Brewster’s Theory of Luslre.
     Sir David Brewster opposes Dove’s theory of lustre,     as he has
 found that when black and white surfaces without drawings are
 combined in the stereoscope, no lustre is produced.        The lustre,
 then, according to this philosopher, is due not to one mass of
 light passing through another, but to the effort of the eyes to
                                                                 -
 combine the stereoecopic pictures.
     Admitting the correctness of Sir David's experiment, Dove
has shown that the objection founded on it is without weight
 (p. 3, Optical Studies).
     In repeating Brewster’s experiment    I always obtain the oppo
site result; in combining uniform black and white surfaces, with
out drawings, I always obtaiu a distinct impression of lustre,
like that of the blackened mirror of a polariseope, and in strict
accordance with Dove’s theory ; when the black <U+FB01>eld is so dark

ened that no light is sent from it to the eye, this lustre vanishes,
and the white paper alone is perceived.          This disagreement is
not a cause of astonishment when we re<U+FB02>ect that De Haldat’s
original experiment waited nearly half a century for con<U+FB01>rma
tion.
     To Brewster’s own theory, the simple objection, which has
already      been  made by others,    that we daily perceive lustre
plainly with one eye, would       seem suf<U+FB01>cient.
                Production of Lustre in Monocular Vision.
     I   proceed now to describe some experiments where by the
action upon a single eye of two masses of light of unequal in
tensity, the idea of lustre is produced.
     1. If a disk of coloured card-board, out of which a number of
 sectors has been removed, be made to rotate rapidly, and an
 object be viewed through it by a single eye, two masses of light
 will reach the eye, which apparently proceed from the object;
 one is re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the disk, the other emanates
 from the object behind the disk, and passes through the <U+FB01>rst
 mass of light.       Dark objects viewed in this way assume to me,
 to a small extent, an appearance like that of blackened glass. The
 effect is not at all striking, and would be overlooked by many
 persons;      I therefore prepared paper in a peculiar way, so as to
 imitate distantly the appearance of foliated graphite or crumpled
 mica.
      White smooth drawing-paper was rubbed over irregularly
 with a brush slightly moistened with a weak wash of India ink
 or lampblack; when dry, another wash of a deeper hue applied
 as before, care being taken to leave many small spots untouched.
 The <U+FB01>nal wash was laid on with pure black.            If the brush be
 kept nearly dry and passed only lightly          over the paper, it is
  easy to obtain a surface hearing some very distant resemblance
  to the minerals above mentioned; it is of course without lustre.
  Similar papers were prepared with red and blue water colours.
      \Vhen these papers were held behind disks of ultramarine or
  orange-tinted paper, from which equal alternate sectors had been
  removed, and which were revolving at such rates that their
  surfaces seemed uniform, or at lower rates, they often appeared,
  to a single eye, highly lustrous.     This was true of the prepared
  paper in a state of rest; when moved slightly by the hand it
  glittered strongly. Dark photographs of tinfoil held behind a
  revolving disk of ultramarine paper and viewed by a single eye,
  assume often to a striking degree the lustre and appearance of
   foliated graphite.
       2. If a piece of this peculiarly blackened paper Q- an inch
   square be placed in a blue <U+FB01>eld (rather light ultramarine paper)

 44                  On Dove’s Theory of Lustre.
 and be steadily regarded for some minutes by'one eye, it assumes
 a red-orange hue, and appears suspended over the blue paper
 and nearer to the eye than the latter; at the same instant it
 appears lustrous like crumpled mica.            The illusion with me
 often lasts half a minute in great perfection; this is particularly
 the case when the eye is not quite accurately focused on the
 p a er.
        If a sheet of this prepared paper be brightly illuminated
 by light from swindow, and be held so near one eye as to pro_
 duce indistinct vision, it often apparently becomes highly lus
 trous. In this case enlarged images of the white and grey
 points are formed on the retina, which overlap, so that again we
 have two masses of light, one passing through the other.
    4. If a roll of black paper like the above, but coarser in its
 markings, be brightly illuminated on one side and viewed through
 deeply coloured plates of glass (red, green, blue), in a few
 seconds it appears lustrous, resembling a roll of polished zine
which has been irregularly and deeply corroded by an acid.
 Upon removing the glass, the surface of the paper appears lus
trous for an instant.
    5. A sheet of the <U+FB01>ner variety of this prepared paper viewed
through a large rhomb of calc-spar, gives often in spots the ap
pearance of lustre, particularly when the head of the observer,
 or the rhomb, is slightly moved.        Some persons compared this
to the appearance of water.
    It would seem probable that in all cases where two masses of
light reach a single eye, one passing through the other, particu
larly when there is any percqzliun of their individuality, that the
appearance of more or less lustre is produced, though from habit
we often overlook it.     ThusiHelmholtz remarks* (upon the com
bination of two    coloured   surfaces in monocular vision by means
of a simple instrument he <U+FB01>gures),
                                         “ It is
                                                 particularly favourable
when the drawings, or spots on the two surfaces, are made to
shift their position. Then we often believe that we see both
colours simultaneously in the same place, the one through the
other.     We have an impression in such cases of seeing objects
through a coloured veil or re<U+FB02>ected from a coloured surface.”
    I found, in fact, that by placing stereographs consisting of co
loured paper for one eye and a photographic drawing of tinfoil
for the other in this instrument, that lustre could be perceived,
particularly with the imitations of copper.
    The diagram represents the instrument referred to; it consists
of a plate of glass, P, with parallel sides, which is properly
supported over a blackened board B.         Differently coloured papers
are placed at K and Y; one is seen through the plate, and the

slight movement of the head induces in the mind the idea of one
 object seen through another.

     In closing, will remark that while many of the experiments
above mentioned are easily repeated, others require considerable
 practice in this kind of observation.

          my tactical paper in the May Number of the                         I
  IN considered the number of groupings and of typesMagazine,        of group
 ings of synthems formed out of triads of three names of three
 elements each.        The <U+FB01>rst example of considering the ensemble of
 the groupings of a de<U+FB01>ned species of synthemes (each of such
 groupings being subjected to satisfy a certain exhaustive con
  dition) was, as already stated, furnished by me in this Magazine,
  April 18%. In that case the synthemes consisted of duads
 belonging to a single nome of 6 elements, and the total number
 of the groupings was observed to be 6, all contained in one type
 or family. The total number of synthemes in that instance being
  15, and there being 6 groupings of 5 synthemes each, it fol
  lowed that in the whole family every syntheme is met with twice
  over; once in one grouping, and once in another.                In the case
  treated of in my last communication to the Magazine, the total
  number of the synthemes of the kind under consideration is 36
   (for it may easily be shown that the number of synthemes of
  n-nomial n-ads of n nomes ofq elements each is (1.2.3. . . q)”");
  and as each grouping contains 9 synthemes, these 36 are distri
  buted without repetition between the 4 groupings of the smaller
  of the two natural species,——a phenomenon of a kind here met
   with for the <U+FB01>rst time in the study of syntax.            If now we go on
   (as  a natural   and   irrepressible   curiosity  urges)   to ascertain the
   groupings    of   the   synthemes    of  binomial   triads   of the same 3

   nomes of three elements each, we advance just one step further in
   the direction of type-complexity; that is to say, we meet with the
   existence of 3, and not more than 3, types or species in which all
   such groupings are comprised.       The investigation by which this
   is made out appears to me well worthy to be given to the world,
  as affording an example of a new and beautiful kind of analysis
  proper to the study of lactic, and thus lighting the way to the
  further opening up of this fundamental doctrine of mathematic,
  the science of necessary relations, ofwhich, combined with logic                            (if
  indeed the two be not identical), tactic appears to me to constitute
  the main stem from which all others, including even arithmetic
  itself, are derived and secondary branches. The key to success in
  dealing with the problems of this incipient science (as suppose of      I
  most others) must be sought for in the construction of an apt
  and expressive notation, and           the discovery of language
                                            in                                                by
  force of which the mind may be enabled to lay hold of complex
  operations and mould them into simple and easily transmissible
 forms of thought.          must then entreat the indulgence of the
                             I

      Let us, as before, represent the nine elements         the numbers 4, by
                                                                         5,

 belonging to the above nomes, and           out of such syntheme we

longing to the second and third nomes variously compounded
with the elements of the <U+FB01>rst nome.
     This framework may be advantageously divided into two parts,
each containing nine terms, and which             shall call respectively

     It   is of cardinal importance to notice that the order in which
the imperfect synthemes are arranged in U and        is one of ab
solute reciprocity.  It is in this reciprocity, and in the fact of
U or U being     each in strict regimen (so to say) with the other,
that the cause of the success of the method about to be applied
essentially resides.
   The slightest re<U+FB02>ection will serve to show that every complete
syntheme of the kind required_will be of the form
                                             UxP

one of the forms (by no means necessarily the same) represented
generally by the framework of defective synthemes hereunder

second and third nomes are supposed to be omitted),

                 a is
the fact of    repetition of the same triad or triads in the same
grouping, contrary to the nature of       grouping. Hence, then,

or 144.
   But now comes the more dif<U+FB01>cult question of ascertaining
between how many distinct species or types these groupings are
distributed.            If we    study the form of            P   or   P,   it   is   obvious that

                  _
    Now as regards the types: since the order of the elements in
 one nome is entirely independent of the order of the elements in
 any other, it is obvious that it is not the particular form of P or
of  P which   can have any in<U+FB02>uence on the form of the type, but
 solely the relation of I’ and          to one another.        In order then to
<U+FB01>x the ideas,   I   shall for the moment consider           P  equal to
                                     123

                                     312
This at once enables us to <U+FB01>x a limit to the number of distinct
types.    In the <U+FB01>rst place, the essentially distinct FORMS of the
<U+FB01>rst column in P, with respect to that of P, may be suf<U+FB01>ciently
represented by taking the two columns identical, or differing by
a single interchange, or else having no two elements in the same
place.    Hence P, so far as the ascertainment of types is con
cerned, may be limited to the six forms following :—
                         (¢)             (1)         (f)

 I   say designedly that the  number    of types    at utmost limited

to these <U+FB01>ve.   But      it     by
                           no means follows that the number         so               is
great as <U+FB01>ve; for     will not fail to be borne in mind that these
                        it
di<U+FB01>'erences have reference to the peculiar mode in which we have
chosen to decompose in idea each syntheme,             viewing   as      by         it    a
symbolical product of an arrangement containing only the ele
ments of the second and third names                           by
                                               an arrangement con
taining only those of the <U+FB01>rst nomes. But the nomes are inter
changeable, and therefore       may very well be the case that two
                                         it
types  which  appear to be  distinct  are in reality identical, their
elements in the groupings appertaining to such types having
absolutely analogous relations to different orderings of the nomes,
so that the groupings will be convertible into each other        per-v              by
mutations among the given elements. We must therefore aseer~
tain how the above types, or any speci<U+FB01>c forms of them, come to

ascertain which admit of being pcrmutable into each other, and
which not.
   The largest species of 108 groupings, it may be observed, is
subdivisible into 3 varieties, not really allotypical, of 36 each,—
the characteristic of those groupings which belong to the same
variety being that they permute ewelusivcly into each other
when the permutations of the elements are con<U+FB01>ned to perturba
tions of the order of the elements in the same nome or nomes,
and the di<U+FB02>‘erent nomcs are subject to no interchange of elements
betWeen themselves.
   Just so the species of 36 groupings of trinomial triads, treated
of in my preceding paper, subdivides into 3 varieties or sub
families characterized by a similar property.                                                   '

I   N the investigation of the new metal     caesium (Cs), which stands
      nearest potassium, Bunsen* has found that, besides caesium,
 there exist sanother metal previously unknown, and which seems
 to resemble potassium as closely as does caesium.
    The platinum salt of caesium is more dif<U+FB01>cultly soluble in water
than that of potassium.          On trying to separate the latter from
the former by repeated boilings with water, in proportion as the
quantity of potassium decreases, the continuous potassium spec
trum between        K:and K3 becomes fainter, and new lines appear,
more especially two very intense ones in the violet between Sr8 -
and KB. A limit is soon reached at which the quantity of potas
sium cannot be further diminished. This is the case when the
sum of the atomic weights of the metals, combined with platinum
and chlorine, has reached 109 (H=1).                     If
                                                    from the platinum

from the dried mixture of the salts principally the hydrated
oxide of caesium.       If this operation be repeated, limit ulti 9.           is
mately   attained   at   which the part dissolved in alcohol has                    a
constant composition.         This limit     reached when the atomic

this enormous weight (next to gold and iodine the highest
known) forms        deliquescent hydrate, as caustic as hydrate of
                    a

lute alcohol at the ordinary temperature, and an anhydrous
 nitrate, which, unlike nitre,    not rhombic but

obtained on the <U+FB01>rst treatment with bichloride of platinum

intense manner, but not a trace of the lines Csu.           If this plati

the blue line Csa must have been visible, together with the
violet ones ; for with the product obtained from the Diirckheim
mineral water, on increasing the quantity of chloride of potas
sium the violet lines always disappear <U+FB01>rst, but the caesium lines
much later, and indeed only with a great excess of the potassium

there must be a <U+FB01>fth alkali metal, which is present in small
quantities in Diirckheim, Kreuznach and other similar mineral
springs, but in lepidolite in larger quantity.
    M. Ste.-Claire Deville    and Troost, in continuation of their in
vestigation   on  the  reproduction of the natural minerals, have
described the preparation of some sulphurets*.
    Sulphuret of zinc is very easily prepared by melting together
equal parts of sulphate of zinc, of <U+FB02>uoride of calcium, and of
 sulphide of barium.     A fusible gangue of sulphate of baryta and
 of <U+FB02>uoride of calcium is obtained, in which are found beautiful
crystals of sulphuret of zinc, either imbedded or arranged in
geodes.     Analysis proved them to be identical in composition
with the natural blende; but they have an entirely different
 form.    Instead of belonging to the monometrie system, they
crystallize in a regular double hexagonal prism, which is pre
cisely the form of the crystals of sulphuret of cadmium.             This
 singular observation supplies a link in the analogies of sulphur
 and cadmium, and establishes the dimorphism of sulphuret of
 zinc. It has received a timely con<U+FB01>rmation in a discovery
’which Friedel has made'l' of the existence of a natural sulphide
of zinc which crystallizes in the hexagonal system. On exa
 mining an argentiferous antimonio-sulphide of lead, he found
 imbedded certain crystals which had all the chemical reactions
 and composition of ordinary zinc blende, but was entirely dif
 ferent in crystalline form.       The crystals consisted of a double
 hexagonal pyramid,     with  occasionally the faces of the hexagonal
 prism. These faces      are   strongly striated parallel to the base,
 and the angle between the adjacent faces of the pyramid was
 found to be about 129°, which is very near that of one of the
 pyramids of Greenockite.        It has four easy cleavages parallel to
 the base and to the faces of the hexagonal prism.          lts action on
 polarized light   further   establishes  the  crystalline form of the

substance.     Friedel proposes to give the name Wurtzite to this
dimorphous variety of zinc blende.
   Deville and Troost have also obtained this hexagonal blende
by a kind of sublimation.            Some sulphuret of zinc placed in
trays   in  a porcelain     tube,  was   heated to bright redness in a
current of hydrogen.          N0  hydrogen was absorbed, and no trace
of sulphuretted hydrogen produced.             Notwithstanding this the
sulphuret of zinc appeared as if volatilized, and was removed to
the cooler parts of the tube in the form of transparent crystals
of the greatest regularity. Hexagonal blende had been formed,
as was seen by a powerful action on polarized light.             The re
action had doubtless taken place in the following manner.             The
sulphuret of zinc at a red heat had been reduced by hydrogen,
forming a mixture of zinc vapour and sulphuretted hydrogen.
Arrived slowly in the cooler parts of the tube, an inverse reaction
occurred; the zinc again took up sulphur to form hexagonal
blende, and hydrogen became free. It served as mineralizing
agent; and the native sulphide may have been formed in the
same manner.       That the volatilization of zinc was only apparent,
was proved by heating sulphide of zinc to a very high tempera
ture in a current of sulphuretted hydrogen.            No trace of subli
mation was obtained in the porcelain tube.
    A   number of crystallized oxides may be obtained by heating
in a platinum crucible          a mixture of the sulphates of these
 oxides and   of  alkaline    sulphates.    The oxide thus liberated at a
 very high temperature in melted sulphate of potass or soda cry
 stallizes. Debray, who had previously obtained glucina in this
 way, has also succeeded in preparing magnesia (periclasc) and
 oxide of nickel *. With sulphate of manganese pretty large cry
 stals of red oxide of manganese, Mn3 0“, were obtained, but they
 were so interlaced that it was impossible to measure their
 angles with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy to be enabled to identify them
 with Hausmannitc.          They have the same composition and hard
 ness ;   the colour   of    their powder is the same, but the arti<U+FB01>cial
 crystals are transparent.
    Alumina, magnetic oxide of iron, and green oxide of uranium
 may be obtained by an analogous method, based on the decom
 position of certain phosphates by alkaline sulphates at a high
 temperature.

numerous analyses, and they would differ according as the com
bustion was free or in a closed space, and whether it was
slow or rapid.    Assuming that the possible products of decom
position of the ferrocyanide are nitrogen,                of potassium,

might be represented in the following manner :—

according to which 100 parts of the powder would yield 52'56
parts of non-volatile, and 47'44 of gaseous substances.
   The decbmposition may take place in conformity with other
reactions, but from a preliminary investigation this appears the
most probable.
   In accordance     with this, 100 parts of the powder           would
yield—

    Pohl calculates from this that the quantity of heat furnished
by the combustion of this substance would be equal to 5063
thermal units. The temperature of the combustion, is obtained
by dividing the number of thermal units by the sum of the spe
ci<U+FB01>c heats of the products of combustion, which amounts to
02636 ; and this gives 1920° C. as the temperature. From Bun
 sen and Schischkoif’s research *, it appears that the heating effect
of ordinary gunpowder is 6195 thermal units, and that the
temperature of its free combustion is 29930 C.          It furnishes in

100 parts 68-06 of solid residue, and 31-38 of gaseous products,
corresponding  to 19310 cubic centims.     From these data the
relation between the two substances is—

        The residues    .  . .  .           .       1        :        0'77
But for the respective temperatures of combustion the reduced
volumes of gas would be for black powder 231411 cubic cen
tim.,  and for white powder 300798 cubic centims., and hence
the quantities of gas would be as       l
                                    : 1'13.            .
   In the combustion  in a con<U+FB01>ned space the temperature of the
combustion would be altered, for there would be a great di<U+FB01>'er
ence in the speci<U+FB01>c heat of the products of combustion.    Hence
the volume of gas, when reduced to the normal temperature and
pressure, would vary.    For white gunpowder, Pohl calculates
the temperature of combustion in a closed space at 26040 C., and
the volume of gas furnished by 100 parts at 431162 cubic cen
tims. Under similar circumstances Bunsen and Schischko<U+FB02>‘
found that the temperature was 3340(3 C., and the volume of gas
258420 cubic centims.
   Hence the relation between the products of combustion in
con<U+FB01>ned space would be—
                                   Blaek powder.   White powder.

    The volumes of gas    .   .   .     .       .       1        :        1'669
   As the action of an explosive powder principally depends on
the volume of the gases formed, for equal weights the new white
powder would produce 1'67 times the action of the other.   But
for equal volumes of the powder the ratio would be different.
Pohl found that a vessel which held 102'542 grms. of white
powder, held 132'355 grms. of ordinary black powder.     Hence
the density of the new powder in reference to the other would
be as 0774 : 1, and the work performed by equal volumes would
be as 1'292 : 1.
   In order to produce the same effect on projectiles, in <U+FB01>ring
mines, 860., 60 parts by weight of the new, would be required for
100 parts of the old. The weights of the residues in the two cases
are respectively 3153 and 68 parts.       Another advantage of the
white powder  is,that the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame      much lower;   is
a greater   number   of shots could  be  <U+FB01>red  without  heating the
projectile too much.     The  new powder      more energetic in its
                                                        is
action than the old, and in this respect stands nearest gun-cotton.
It has the advantage over this substance of being cheaper and

           M. Deville   on certain Phenomena   of Di<U+FB01>‘usion.   61
easier to prepare, and it can be kept for a long time without
undergoing any change.
   The new powder contains chlorate of potash; and this, in all
substitutes for gunpowder of which it is a constituent, forms
products of combustion at a high temperature, which attack the
<U+FB01>rearms.    If the decomposition of the white powder takes place
in accordance with the equation already given, it is not easy to
see why this evil is to be feared.    It could be most simply de
cided by <U+FB01>ring  olf a certain number of shots with a given weapon.
Another advantage of the new powder is its dif<U+FB01>cult explosibility
by pressure and percussion.      Explosion is only produced by the
heaviest blow of iron upon iron; it is not produced by the fric
tion of wood upon metal, or between stones, See. The new pow
der is also far easier of preparation than the old; and if the raw
materials are at hand, a large quantity of it may be prepared in
a few hours with no other apparatus than a stamping-mill and
mixing tub.
  The following observations      have been made by Ste-Claire
Deville* on the in<U+FB02>uence exerted by the sides of certain vessels
on the motion and composition of gases traversing them.
   In laboratories, earthen and stoneware vessels are often used
for reaction with gases at a high temperature.      They are suit
able for most gases; but they are permeable to hydrogen, and
they absorb water.
   1. A rapid current from hydrogen is passed through one of
these tubes. The tube is closed by two corks, in which are <U+FB01>tted
glass tubes; one of these tubes admits hydrogen; the other,
 which dips in water, serves for the escape of the gas. On
closing the stopcock by which hydrogen enters, not only does
the gas cease to be liberated, but the water rises to a height of
60 to 70 centimetres above its level, as if the hydrogen had been
drawn into the interior of the apparatus.       With coal-gas the
 aspiration is less, and appears to depend on the density of the
 gas ; and there is none at all in the case of carbonic acid.
    2.If  the air be passed more slowly into the interior of the
 tube, but still more rapidly than in the majority of operations,
 the gas collected in the trough is no longer hydrogen, but pure
air.

current of hydrogen be passed through       it,

 lowing method :—--the earthen tube is enclosed in a larger glass
 tube, and carbonic acid is passed into the annular space between
 the two tubes, while hydrogen traverses the earthen tube.            The
 two gases emerge by two distinct delivery tubes.          One of the two
 currents of gas is in<U+FB02>ammable, and it is precisely that which pro

31.               misconception     of my theory of material forces
       THE   displayed  in the remarks of Professor Challis *, seems
to require    a brief and,   I  trust, clearer restatement of the pro
posed <U+FB01>rst principle of Molecular Mechanics, along with its
second and third principles, before proceeding to their applica
                                            '
tion and development.
    32. (L) Matter is conceived as made up, not of an elastic
aether and inelastic atoms, but of elastic molecules of different
orders as to size and density.
    If a rough physical conception of these molecules be required,
they may be conceived as aethereal nuclei, the axther of the nuclei
of a lower being made up of nuclei of a higher order, and so on
ad in<U+FB01>nitum.
    I  shall, perhaps, best defend this principle by restating the
experimental objections to that for which it is substitutcdz—(l)
We are led by experiment to conclude that all matter is elastic,
and hence we are not justi<U+FB01>ed in assuming two kinds of matter,
an elastic and inelastic.       (2) Not to speak of the inconsistency
of denying to the atoms the elasticity which is attributed to the
tether, which must be made up of atoms, it is impossible to con
ceive that, from any arrangement of inelastic atoms, the elasticity
of the bodies they constitute should arise; though it is at once
admissible that degrees of elasticity may depend on the arrange
ment of elastic atoms.         (3) The action of an elastic tether, or
                                                               ” is
anything else, on an “absolutely hard, ultimate atom                expe
rimentally inconceivable; for all known action of one body on
another implies motion of the particles of that other body.            If
a body is struck, it is heated, and moves; if it moves little, it is
                    * Phil. Mag. p. 504,, June 1861.

                          Principe: of Energetics.                 63
much heated.     (4) The analogy “to the production of secondary
waves, when a small obstacle is encountered by primary waves,
propagated on the surface of water,” is fallaeious. For all such
obstacles are elastic, and it seems a prodigious assumption to
 imagine that unknown inelastic, would have the same effect as
 known elastic bodies.     (5) Not only the generation of (secondary
 waves, but the origination of primary waves is experimentally
 inconceivable.   For the hypothesis is—inelastic atoms of the same
 inertia in a uniform tether; and the experimental condition of
 motion is—dz<U+FB01>erence of pressure.
    33. (IL) Physical phenomena are to be explained from the
 conception of motions of different orders of molecules.
    This conception has been forced on me by the impossibility of
reconciling the notion of Electricity, Light, Heat, Actinism, &c.
as states of molecular strain or motion, with the experimental
facts of their coexistence, and mutual modi<U+FB01>cation.
    34. (111.) Chemical phenomena are to be explained from the
conception of systems of different orders of molecules in dyna
                            ‘

    Bodies are thus conceived as systems of molecular motion;
their sensible differences as dependent on di<U+FB02>'erences of the
orders, and motions, of their constituent molecules; their per
manence as dependent on the continuance of dynamic equili
brium, that    is,of the same state of motion at ever point; and
dissolution, combination, or the formation of new bodies as the
result of di<U+FB02>'erence between two or more systems of molecular
motion, in mediate or immediate contact.         As an illustration of
this and the preceding principle, take the explanation a<U+FB01>'orded
of Dr. Tyndall's discovery of the greater absorption and radia
tion of compound gases*.         compound gas will, in this theory,
                                    A
be conceived as      system, the moving molecules of which are of
                     a
a  relatively low order. Now        clear that, suppose, for instance,
                                    it   is
the molecules, whose motions determine the chemical character
of the gas, are of order (1), and that the molecules, whose vibra
tions give the sensation of heat, arc of order (6), there are the
motions of <U+FB01>ve, instead of, as in     simple gas,
                                          a          smaller number

of orders of molecules to be affected. Hence, degree of absorp
tion of motion      seen to depend on the number of motions to
                     is
be affected.
   ButI    must reserve     fuller explanation of this and con

  raised when any separate order of molecules is considered.                    But
  that there will be found great analytical dif<U+FB01>culty in passing
  from a higher to a lower order of molecules, and in expressing
  the correlations of their motions, is not to be concealed.                   And
  that little help is to be found in existing analytical investigations,
  except, perhaps, those relative to the conduction of heat in cry
  stalline media, is not to be wondered at, seeing how recent is the
  conception of the Correlation of Forces.

   distillation, ,it begins to boil at 94° C., and between this temperature
   and 140° a considerable quantity of a colourless liquid distils over.
   The distillation then suddenly stops, the thermometer rises rapidly,
   and, to avoid secondary products of decomposition, the operation
   should now be interrupted.            The materials remaining in the retort
   solidify,   on  cooling,  into   a   mass  of large crystals, which are a com
  pound     of ethylate  of zinc   with   zincethyle. On recti<U+FB01>cation, the distil

   which temperature the last two-thirds of the liquid passed over and
  were received apart.          The product thus collected exhibited a con

   Boric ethide possesses the following properties      is a colourless               :-It
mobile liquid of a pungent odour; its vapour is very irritating to the
mucous membrane. and provokes a copious <U+FB02>ow of tears.         The spe
ci<U+FB01>c gravity of boric ethide at 23° C. is '696l ; it boils at 959 C.,
and the results of several determinations of its vapour-density give
the number 3'4006. The calculated vapour-density of boric ethide,
volumetrically composed like terchloride of boron, is 3'3824.
    Boric ethide is insoluble in water, and is very slowly decomposed
by prolonged contact with it. Iodine has scarcely any action upon
it, even at 100° C.    It <U+FB02>oats upon concentrated nitric acid for several
minutes without change      but suddenly violent oxidation takes place,
                                          ;                          a

 time artial decomposition, and invariably leaving a slight residue of
 boracic acid. Its vapour tastes intensely sweet.              It reddens litmus

 It is very soluble in water, alcohol,'and ether. Ex osed to a gentle
 heat it fuses, and at a higher temperature boils wit partial decom

 _(glycol) that propionic acid bears to ordinary alcohol.                Propionic
 acid can be obtained by treating the cyanide of the alcohol radical

of the glycol radical with the same reagent, or is it an isomeric acid

 then heated gently as long as acid vapours continued to be evolved,
 digested with absolute alcohol, and <U+FB01>ltered, and then the <U+FB01>ltrate was

‘The electric organ is always charged.           It may be conclusively shown

  to be equal in electromotive power ; subject a certain number of them
  to repeated stimulation, and then, by means of the method of opposed
  couples, compare the muscles which have been exercised with those
  which have been left at rest, and it will be found that the latter
  will manifest a much greater degree of electromotive power than
  the former.       The nervous excitation, which causes muscular con~
  traction, developes heat, generates mechanical force and consumes
  chemical af<U+FB01>nity; and as the electromotive apparatus of muscle
  operates throu h means of that af<U+FB01>nity, it must get weakened, like a
 pile in which t e acid has become weaker.                 In the Torpedo, on the
 other hand, there is neither heat nor mechanical force produced, and
 the electromotive apparatus is set up again, as it were, through the
 in<U+FB02>uence of the nerves, after the manner of a secondary pile.”

     Among the numerous compounds into which benzol, when sub
mitted to reagents, is converted, azobcnzol and its derivatives have as
yet received but limited attention.                Although more than twenty
<U+FB01>ve      ears have elapsed since this interesting body was discovered
by       itscherlich, both its formation and its constitution remain still
doubtful.
    Mitscherlich *, who discovered azobenzol in 1834, when submitting
nitrobenzol to the action of an alcoholic solution of potassa, repre
sented this compound by the formula

unexplained.         In 1845 this body        was repreparcd by Hofmann and
MusprattI,       who     observed among      the collateral products of the reac
tion aniline and oxalic acid.                 They represent the formation of

adding at the same time that they are far from considering this
equation as more than the representation of one phase of the trans
formation of nitrobenzol, since several other rather inde<U+FB01>nite com
pounds or products are formed simultaneously.
    At about the same period Zinin made the interesting observation

       Considering the physical characters both of nzobenzol and of ben

   ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen in the latter compound, the sum of
   the number of equivalents of these two elements not being divisible
   by 2, many chemists were inclined to double the formula: of both
   bodies, and to represent them by the following expressions :—

       The molecular value of benzidine being thus almost exclusively
  <U+FB01>xed by the determination of the formula of the compound from

       With this view I have determined the vapour-density of azoben

presents itself as a well-de<U+FB01>ned diacid diamine.               The molecular con
struction of the diatomic base remained to be decided.
     I have endeavoured to solve this problem by the process of
ethylation, as yet the simplest and the best guide in determining
questions of this kind.               Benzidine in the presence of alcohol is
rapidly attacked by iodide of ethyle.                After two hours’ digestion at
100° C. in sealed tubes, the reaction is complete.                   The solution on
evaporation yields a crystalline iodide,

from which ammonia separates a solid crystalline base very similar
to henzidine.           This compound, which fuses at 65° C., and resolidi~
<U+FB01>es at 60° C., is diethylbenzidine:
                           Cw H20 N2=Ciz H10 (02 "5): N2,
which forms well-crystallizable salts with the acids, and yields with
dichloride of platinum a dif<U+FB01>cultly soluble crystalline platinum-salt
containing                       Cm H22 Na Cl2      2PtCl,.
 ‘   When diethylbenzidine is treated again with iodide of ethyle, the
 phenomena previously observed repeat themselves.                     The iodide

 Tetrethylbenzidine          resembles      the diethylated and the non-ethylated
 base.      It   fuses at 85°    C., resolidifying    at 80° C., produces with the
 acids crystalline compounds, and furnishes with dichloride of plati

      The further action of iodide of ethyle upon tetrethylbenzidine is
  extremely slow.          After 12 hours’ digestion at 100° C. only a very
  minute quantity         of  the base had been transformed into an iodide.

have   hitherto been produced only by the action of potash upon'
bromisatine and chorisatine, the indirect method, by which they were
originally obtained by Dr. Hofmann; it appeared therefore of some
interest to ascertain whether the bodies generated directly from
compounds of phenylamiue would exhibit differences in their proper
ties similar to those which distinguish alpha- and beta-nitrophenyl
amine.
   With the view of deciding this question experimentally, I have
submitted acetylphenylamide to the action of bromine and chlorine,
in the hope of thus forming directly from phenylamme the bromi
nated and chlorinated compounds in question.

 which a slight difference was observed.             Both compounds are
 capable of crystallizing either in needles or in well-de<U+FB01>ned octahedra,
the former being generally obtained from water, and the latter from
 alcohol. The bromphenylamine, obtained from the acetyle-compound,
 appears to be more inclined to crystallize in needles than in octa

 examination of the products of decomposition of the two brom
 phenylamines; and the uestion whether these two bodies are really
 identical, or similarly re ated as the two nitro-eompounds, must be
 decided by further experiments*.

 although    still isomeric,      essentially    differ   in their   properties;      amido
benzoic acid being         transformed        into   a   new   acid,—oxybenzoic          acid,
whilst anthranilic       acid    yields   salicylic   acid.
    It appeared of some interest to try whether the substitution of ni
 trogen for hydrogen in anthranilic acid would furnish a compound
 isomeric with the double acid obtained from amidobenzoic acid.                             A
 current of   nitrous    acid,    when    passed    into   a cold   alcoholic    solution   of
 anthranilic acid, rapidly transforms this substance into a compound
 crystallizing in white prisms, which is easily obtained by allowing
 the alcohol to eva orate at the common temperature.                         The new body
is extremely     soluble    in   water,   insoluble     in  ether.    By    analysis   it was
proved to     contain         ,
                                        CH‘HQ N5     0,.
    The new com ound is thus seen to be far from isomeric with the
  derivative of amidbbenzoic acid produced under similar circumstances,
 with which, in fact, it shows no analogy whatever. I have not yet
 arrived at a de<U+FB01>nite view regarding the molecular construction of
 this body; nevertheless its deportmcnt with water shows even now
 that the nitrogen in it exists in two different forms.                     Gently heated
 with   water,  the   new    compound         disengages      torrents    of nitrogen ; on

  nearly a straight line from north to south, commencing at the Grey
   hound Pit, near Oakengates Tunnel of the Shrewsbury and Bir
  mingham Railway, and terminating at John Anstice and Co.'s
   Hales<U+FB01>eld Pits near Madely.       Particular reference was made to the
  explanation    of the nature of the Great East or Symon Fault.      The
  author commenced making his observations on the Malinslee and
  Stirchlee Royalties in 1843; and in 1845 he came to the conclusion
  that what the miners termed in this locality the " Symon Fault,”
  that is the successive dying out of certain coal-seams, ironstones,
  8w. at various depths underground, was due to an old denudation
  which had produced an inclined surface at the expense of some of
  the beds before the upper measures were deposited. Having obtained,
  in course of time, correct sections of several pits situated in the
  N.-S. line above mentioned, the author, taking the “ Little Flint "
  (the lowest workable coal) as a base-line, plotted the several shifted
  segments of the coal-<U+FB01>eld in a vertical plan, and thus restored the
  original outline of the denuded area (one side of a valley) as seen in
  a transverse section.     Six sinkings in the N.-S. line having indi
  cated the successive disappearance of five workable coal-beds in a
  distance of 2484 yards, a seventh pit, 2000 yards further south, was
  found to yield all the coals again ; and the author thinks that between
  the 6th (the Grange) and the 7th (Hales<U+FB01>eld) pit the coals re-occur
  successively on the opposite side of the old valley of denudation, and
  that they may here be sought for and worked advantageously. The
  line of the old valley of denudation apparently strikes the Great East
 fault, as laid down on the Geological Survey Map, at a considerable
  angle.

         “ On  the Occurrence of Cyrena'<U+FB02>uminalis associated with Ma
 rine Shells in Sand and Gravel above the Boulder-clay at Kelsey Hill
  near Hull."      By Joseph Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S., Treas.G.S. &c.
     The author's. observations tended to show that the Cyrena <U+FB02>ami
 nalis, instead of being limited, in its occurrence, to beds beneath the
  Boulder-clay (under which circumstance it is found in Norfolk), oc
  curs in deposits of newer date, and that the argument, that the
  Well-known beds at Grays, in Essex, are older than the Boulder
  clay, depending much on the presence of this shell, would lose much
  of its force if this Cyrena were proved to belong also to the newer
  geological horizon. The question is now the more important. as this
  shell has been found by Mr. Prestwich in the beds that contain <U+FB02>int
 implements at Abbeville.
     The author proceeded to show that some gravels and sands near
  Hull in Yorkshire, formerly described by Professor Phillips. contain
  abundance    of the Cyrena <U+FB01>uminalis, associated with twenty-two
  species of marine shells, two of which have Arctic characters, the
  others being common littoral forms. These gravels and sands were
  proved, by well-sections and other exposures, especially by borings
‘and trenches made by the author and Mr. T. J. Smith, of Hull, to
 overlie the Boulder-clay.                             ~  - -         ~ f

                            BY M. L. DUFOUR.
       a preceding communication it has been shown that water, kept
IN    in suspension in a liquid of its own density, could be cooled much
below 0° without solidifying.        It was probable that other bodies
placed in similar conditions would experience a similar retardation of
solidi<U+FB01>cation.    The following are three examples :—
    Sulpliur.—The persistence of this body in the <U+FB02>uid state below
115° has been already noted (M. Person and Prof. Faraday), but it is
an exception not frequently mentioned.                   -
    It is easy to prepare a solution of chloride of zinc which has the
same or a little higher density than that of liquid sulphur.           This
solution can be heated to 115° without boiling; sulphur may be
melted in      it,
                 and then <U+FB02>oats in spheres.         In order to keep the
spheres Surrounded by liquid,         layer of oil may be poured on the

solution.     On cooling, the solidi<U+FB01>cation scarcely ever takes place at
the melting-point.      The liquid globules usually sink to 70°, 50°.
81c. before solidifying.      The solidi<U+FB01>cation        spontaneous, or
                                                                  is               it

                                                 is
in order to avoid contact of the air. The liquid transparent glo
bules of phosphorus are easily seen, and their solidi<U+FB01>cation does not
take place till far below 44°. Globules,             to   millims. in diameter,
                                                                  2

 so, against the side of the glass.    In virtue of the slight difference
in density, this liquid     assumes the spheroidal form, and does not
adhere to the glass.       I have seen globules 8 millims. in diameter
 retain the liquid state to 55°.
    It is probable that other bodies, if placed in suitable conditions,
would also present the phenomenon which the preceding bodies mani
fest in such a pronounced degree.       Unfortunately it is di<U+FB02>icult with
 a large number to realize the essential condition, which is to pass
the ordinary temperature of change of state while the body <U+FB02>oats in
equilibrium in a liquid of the same density.         The liquid selected
must, in point of fact, ful<U+FB01>l the four following conditions: it must
 have the same density as the body under experiment, retain the <U+FB02>uid
state above and below its melting-point, and not exert any chemical
action.    Spite of these requirements, I do not doubt that chemistry
will furnish the means of successfully applying to other substances
the method by which the retardation of the solidi<U+FB01>cation of water,
sulphur, and phosphorus is so easily and certainly effected.—

ON THE     CHANGES PRODUCED IN THE POSITION 01" THE PIXIED
    LINES lN THE SPECTRUM 0F HYPONITRXC ACID BY CHANGES
    IN DENSITY.      BY M. WEISS.
    Weiss has found by actual measurement that the distance between
the dark lines in the spectrum of hyponitric acid diminishes as the
density of the gas increases.     The measurements were made with an
Oertling's circle reading directly to two seconds of arc, and, by a
<U+FB01>lar micrometer in the ocular, to a single second.     The same pheno.
menon occurs with the spectrum of chlorophyll.         The stronger the
extract in ether, the less is the distance of the absorption-bands.
Thus the absorption-band in the red, in the case of a strong extract,
corresponds quite well with Fraunhofer's line C; in the case of a
weak extract it stands at some distance from it. The other absorp
tion-bands in this spectrum undergo similar dislocations.
    These changes in the distances of the dark lines are very sensible,
even in the spectrum of hyponitric acid, when the changes in the
density of the gas are considerable; they are not, however, equal for
all the dark lines.
    The cause of these dislocations is to be sought, according to Weiss,
in a one-sided absorption which each line undergoes toward the
violet end of the spectrum when the density of the body is increased.
This is shown by direct observations and comparisons with the solar
spectrum as well as by numerous measurements.           There is no spe
ci<U+FB01>c absorption upon both sides of each line, but only an absorption
upon the side of the line which lies toward the violet end of the
spectrum. In this manner the bands become broader, and the di
stance between them less.       The author has observed similar changes
in the breadth of Fraunhofer’s lines at sunset.     In this case also the
absorption was only upon one side.        From this it appears that the
lines of hyponitric acid cannot be used as standards in determinations
of indices, &c.-—Poggendor<U+FB01>"sz1nnalen, vol. cxii. p. 153, Jan. 1861 ;

              Klaprothine or lazulite is comparatively a rare mineral.
 THEIt appears         to have been <U+FB01>rst recognized by Widenmann
 in l791,in the valley of the Muhr, near Krieglach in Upper Styria.
 By \Verner it was mistaken for felspar; and, although examined
 by Klaproth, its true nature was not detected until the analysis
 by Fuchs of specimens afterwards discovered near \Verzen in
 Salzburg.       Brandes then examined the Kricglach specimens,
 and showed their identity in composition            with the examples
 analysed by Fuchs-1'.      The   other known   localities of this mineral
 comprise Vorau near Gratz in Styria (examples from which spot

If we transpose these numbers, as regards the silica (an impurity) and the
half per cent. of water said to have been obtained, his analysis will agree
closely with those of other chemists.

Prof. T. Sterry Hunt, of the Geological Survey of Canada, I
propose in the present place to offer a brief notice of its leading
                              ‘
mineralogical characters.                                    _
   All the earlier determinations of lazulite crystals referred the
mineral to the trimetric or rhombic system.       Priifer of Vienna
was the <U+FB01>rst to maintain its monoclinic character; and the angles
given in the more recent works on mineralogy are adopted from
his measurements.     The European crystals present in general a
somewhat complicated aspect, although certain combinations
closely resemble thosesof the trimetric system.        Two “augite
      ” are                    These,            to Priifer, measure
pairs       always present.           according
respectivcl over a front edge 100° 20' and 99° 40', the difference
being but ittle more than half a degree. According to the same
observer, moreover, the inclination of the base on the prism-plane          ‘
(OonoP, in the notation of Naumann) only differs from a
right angle by 23'. \Vere these values consequently all that we
had to depend upon, it would be manifestly unsafe to rely upon
them as proofs of the monoclinic crystallization of lazulite.   But
in some combinations the forms below the middle zone of the
crystal are less numerous than those above this zone, or otherwise
differ from the latter in their measurements.       Nevertheless in
certain trimetric minerals, and notably in datolitc and \Volfram,
we have the same peculiarity, and we might therefore look upon
these lazulite crystals as trimetric combinations hemihcdrally
modi<U+FB01>ed.      From my examination of the North Carolina speci
mens,  I  cannot but think that this view will in the end prevail.
It is supported by the fact that in many combinations the upper
and lower forms do actually correspond in number and character,_
and that practised crystallographers like Phillips and Lévy, skilled
in the use of the goniometcr, were unable to detect in their mea
surements the differences announced by Priifer*.
    The North Carolina crystals (presuming those in my possession
to represent the generality of crystals obtained at this locality),
although usually distorted, are of extreme simplicity, contrast
ing remarkably in this respect with the majority of European
examples.    At first sight they resemble a monoclinic prism ter
minated by a single “augite pair” 'or hemi-pyramid; but they
really consist      monoclinic) of two hemi-pyramids, the four
                   (if
planes of one of which are greatly elongated; or      trimetric (as
                                                             if
I conceive them to be), they form    rbombic octahedron in which

  *   These observers appear to be the only crystallographers who have
  ractieally examined crystals of lazulite. Thus the measurements of Phil
 ips are followed  byHausmnnn, Breithaupt, and others; those of Lévy, by
Dufre'uoy; and those of Priifcr, by Naumann, Dana, Quenstedt, and Miller.

    The measurements of Phillips give for the octahedral angles,
as deduced    by Hausmann, 99° 16' (over front edge), 96° 39'
(over  side  edge),  and 136° 20’ (over middle edge).            The posi
tion of the crystals,     as  adopted by Phillips,      is  here  changed,
however, his middle edge being made a front polar edge, and
the reverse.
    Many of these North Carolina crystals appear to possess
another form in addition to those enumerated above.                 This is
the front polar or macrodome, occurring generally on two opposite
edges only, and thus presenting a monoclinic character, but
lying sometimes on only one edge, and being consequently (if
the mineral be trimetric) a tetartohedral modi<U+FB01>cation.               It is a
mere line,  dull  like  the  other   planes, and  too  narrow  to  admit  of
satisfactory measurement.         The crystals are sometimes implanted
                         I
in one another; but have not detected any de<U+FB01>nite twin-combi
nations.    The crystals extractcd from my specimen, together
with those exposed on the surface of this, do not amount, how
ever, to more than ten or twelve in number.                 The hardness
of these crystals is equal to 5'75, or very nearly to 60.               The
speci<U+FB01>c gravity (one determination only)         I  found to equal 3'108,
a value corresponding       sufficiently with that obtained by Smith
and Brush (3-122).        The cleavage Ihave not been able to deter
mine in a satisfactory manner.            The blowpipe reactions are as
follows :—
    In the closed tube the assay gives off water and loses its
colour, becoming ellowish or greyish white.
    Per se, it exfoliates and expands greatly in bulk, changes
colour, tinges the <U+FB02>ame green, and crumbles away without
                                    '
fusing.
    In borax it dissolves very easily, imparting to the glass        a pale
ferruginous tinge.                      .
    In salt of phosphorus it dissolves also very readily, and with
slight c<U+FB01>‘crvescence.                      .
    In carbonate of soda it dissolves partially, but the dissolved
portion is in great part precipitated as the glass cools, forming a
white enamel.      Ifthc bead be dissolved in a little boiling water,
a drop of nitric acid added to decompose the excess of carbonate
of soda, and the clear supernatant liquid be then poured upon a

small crystal of nitrate of silver, 8. yellow precipitate of phosphate
is at once obtained.     In employing this test for phosphates, the
beginner   should  be cautioned,   however, that silicates      decom    (if
posable     by
            carbonate   of soda) will produce  the   same reaction,  but
the silica may be eliminated              by
                                    adding several drops of acid and
evaporating to dryness.      By treatment with salt of phosphorus,
moreover, silicates are at once recognized.      If the solution of our
mineral, as obtained above, be treated with acetate of lead, the
precipitate presents the well-known blowpipe reaction of phos
phate of lead,   i.e. the formation of       faceted globule without
                                                     a

 86       Prof. Magnus on        the Propagation  of Heat in  Gases.
 The above experiments with cotton and cider-down speak against
 this 5 for it can scarcely be assumed that the heating takes place
 through radiation. Moreover, the experiments which’Dr. Franz
  has published* on the radiation through hydrogen, show that
  more heat-rays do not pass through hydrogen than through at
 mospheric air.        It appeared, however, necessary, before main
 taining that gases can conduct heat, to determine by new
  experiments how far that doubt was founded.            Hence the deter
 minations on the passage of heat-rays through various gases
 were concluded when          I communicated to the Academy, in July
 of last year (1860), the investigation           on the conduction of
 heat.
    As far as I know, Dr. Franz’s are the only experiments which
 have hitherto been published on the diathermancy of the gases.
 These, which moreover only refer to atmospheric air, hydrogen,
 and carbonic acid, could not be suf<U+FB01>cient for the present pur
  pose, because an argand lamp was used as a source of heat.
  But it was not merely possible, but even probable that the
 transmission of thermal rays would differ with the source whence
 they came.       If therefore the experiments were to be conclusive,
 the transmission must be investigated for rays proceeding from
 the same source of heat, that of boiling water.
                    Boiling water as a source    of Heat.
    Dr. Franz in his experiments enclosed the gases in tubes
 closed at both ends by pieces of plate glass.           Now from Mel
 loni’s experiments-1', rays from so low a source of heat penetrate
 plate glass in scarcely perceptible quantities.        Even when   I used
 plates of rock-salt to close a tube a metre in length, the action
 which the rays of boiling water produced upon the thermo-pile
 were so small, that a comparison of the different gases furnished
 no satisfactory results. It further appeared desirable to avoid any
 kind of plates, even of rock- salt; for although, from Melloni’s
 experiments, the rays which have passed through this substance
'comport themselves exactly like those which proceed directly
 from the source of heat and have only passed through air, yet
 the rock-salt might possibly alter the rays, and exert an in<U+FB02>uence
 on their subsequent passage through different gases.              I  have
 accordingly undertaken new experiments on the diathermancy
 of gases for obscure heat, in which it was my object to allow the
 rays of heat to pass through the gases without necessitating
 their passage through any plate.
    When these experiments were <U+FB01>nished,           I  saw from the ‘Pro
               * Poggendor<U+FB01>’s Annalen, vol. xciv.

     ceedings of the Royal Society*’ that Dr. Tyndall in London
     was engaged with an inVestigation on the transmission of heat
     through gases. As Dr. Tyndall, whose research is only just
     announced, has experimented with'tubes which were closed by
     plates of rock-salt,            I
                             considered that the following investigation
     was independent of that of Dr. Tyndall.
         The apparatus which                       I
                                      used was constructed        as follows.
     Upon the plate of an air-pump TT, <U+FB01>g. 2. Plate                     which                        1.,

     cemented on the plate.         The mounting of this pile was of
     brass, and had an internal diameter of 24 millims. and            length                        a
     of 118 millims. The pile itself was only 30 millims. long.                                                It
     contained 56 pairs of antimony and bismuth, which together
     formed      section of 30 millims. square.
                    a                                 The wires from this

by means of a very delicate multiplier with a double needle,
which was connected by copper wires with the binding screws
LL. The wire of the multiplier consisted of copper which had
been galvanoplastically deposited, and was free froin iron. It is
themultiplier whichI used in my investigation on thermo-clectric
currents.      I tried to use in its stead a multiplier with a steel
mirror, which was read by means of a telescope and scale; but
spite of this mode of observation I found it less delicate, mani
festly because the steel mirror was not astatic.           \Vhether a
 multiplier with mirror and astatic needle would not be better
for these observations I have not tried; but I doubt it; for the
 reading off by means of a mirror is only suited for small dif
 ferences of angles, while in using an astatic needle greater
 deviations are observed.      The multiplier used was placed upon a
 <U+FB01>rm stand separate from the rest of the apparatus.
      In investigating the diathermancy of a gas, water at 100° C.
 was poured into the vessel C, and kept at that temperature by
 means of steam passed into it from a <U+FB02>ask in the neighbourhood.
 The moment the screen ccee was displaced, the needle began
 to move slowly, and after it had reached its greatest de<U+FB02>ection,
 it assumed a <U+FB01>xed position in the course of about two minutes,
 after a few very small oscillations.       This was read off partly
  directly, and partly by means of a telescope; in the latter case
  a rectangular prism was placed directly over that part of the
  divided circle which was to be observed, so that the position of
  the needle could be seen by re<U+FB02>exion.       When this was e<U+FB02>‘ccted,
  the screen was replaced over the pile, upon which the needle
 reverted to its original position.    It was never, however, exactly
  over the null-point of the scale, either because the torsion of the
  wire had changed a little, or because there had been a slight
  difference of temperature in the pile.     As in the multiplier used
  the coils of wire were quite free from magnetism, the replace
  ment at 0° could easily have been effected by turning the
   divided circle independently of the magnetic needle.       But this
  might easily have produced <U+FB02>uctuations of the entire apparatus,
  and it therefore appeared better to take the mean of the positions
   of equilibrium before and after the de<U+FB02>ection, and to subtract
   this from the observed de<U+FB02>ection.       The observations thus ob
  tained agreed very well with each other when several were made
   successively.    It was only after the experiments had been c0n~
   tinned some time that the numbers somewhat disagreed, because
   the pile became a little warmer at one end.      Four to six of such
   observations were always made in succession, and the mean of
   these taken.
       The values corresponding to the de<U+FB02>ections of the galvano
   méter were determined by the method given by Melloni in his

       Prof. Magnus on the Propagation of Heat in Gases.          89
‘
  Thermochrose,’ page 59. As far as l4°'5 the strengths of the
current were proportional to the deviations.
   In order to <U+FB01>ll the apparatus with any given gas, it was <U+FB01>rst
exhausted, the gas admitted by the stopcock H, then again
exhausted and <U+FB01>lled a second time with the gas, and so on for'
four times, upon which the atmospheric air could be considered
to be completely removed.        With gases like cyanogen and
ammonia which attack the pump, the <U+FB01>lling was performed by
displacement,   the gas being admitted by the stopcock C, and
escaping by the stopcock K, under the plate TT. For this pur
pose the whole apparatus, with the plate T T, was removed from
the air-pump and placed on a tripod. On the lower part of the
stopcock K a glass tube was <U+FB01>tted, through which the gas passed
into an absorbent liquid.    If the gas was to be used in a rare<U+FB01>ed
state, the rarefaction was effected, after the <U+FB01>lling was complete,
by means of the air-pump.       The rarefaction thus produced was
either directly observed by the barometer, or a manometer was
introduced, which was read off by means of a cathetometer. Thus
the most di<U+FB02>'crent gases could be examined as to their capacity
of transmitting heat, with the exception of those which attacked
the metal of the pile. This excluded, to my great regret, all
coloured gases. .
   The gases were prepared exactly as in the experiments on
conduction.
   As the intensity of the galvanometer might have changed in
the course of time, in almost every case before the apparatus was
<U+FB01>lled with a new gas the radiation through atmospheric air was
determined.      In this way the relation of the radiation in the
particular gas to that of atmospheric air was obtained.         This
method of comparison        have always retained, for it ensures
great certainty. In experiments with boiling water this compa
rison was ultimately found super<U+FB02>uous, for the galvanometer
remained so unchanged that the values obtained at different
times for atmospheric air agreed very closely.      Nevertheless in
the following Table the observed de<U+FB02>ections are so arranged that
the control experiments with atmospheric air are found in one
column, and the gases examined either directly before or after
are placed opposite, being separated from the rest by a horizontal
line.
   For the gases which exhibit the greatest deviation, the radia
tion has been determined at different times.        Since the num
bers obtained agreed as closely as could be expected with such
experiments and with such angles, I have only adduced one series.

   If the de<U+FB02>ections obtained with atmospheric            air under  a pres
sure of 1 atmosphere are collated, we obtain
   we,     14%, 14%, 14P-5, 149-3, 14P-5, 149-4, 14%, 14%,
            14-45, 142-4,
the mean    being 14°“4.
   For all other gases the de<U+FB02>ections are less.          But as the de<U+FB02>ec
tions  are proportional to the intensities of the current up to
140-4, and as these are proportional to the increase in tempera
ture of the pile, the quantities of heat which pass through differ
ent gases under the same pressure are as follows :—
               Atmospheric air . .          144 or 100

               Ammonia        .   .  .  .      6'3   ,,    43'7
   As oxygen gave exactly the same value as atmospheric air, it
 was unnecessary to examine nitrogen.
    For atmospheric air the de<U+FB02>ections were for a pressure of—
                         8 millims.    = 15°‘8
                         9 millims.    = 15 '8
 This de<U+FB02>ection is no longer proportional to the intensity of the
 current, but corresponds to a value of 162, the value for 1° be
 tween 0° and 14° being placed equal to 1.               If  it be assumed
 that the radiation through vacuum would produce the same de
 <U+FB02>ection, the heat which passes through vacuum would be to that
which   passes  through atmospheric air under        a pressure   of 1 atmo
 sphere, as
                      16'2  :   144:100    :  88-88.
    In order to obtain greater certainty for this proportion, I de
termined the radiation through rare<U+FB01>ed air by interposing in the
conduction a wire which offered considerable resistance, in order
that the de<U+FB02>ections might be smaller, and proportional to the
intensities of the current. In the three following determinations
the air was under a pressure of 41 millims.             Directly before and
after each of them the radiation through atmospheric air under
a pressure of one atmosphere was determined.                The correspond
ing  determinations    are indicated   by the    same    number.

   Although these values cannot be looked upon as quite reliable,
inasmuch as variations may occur from imperfect purity of the
gas, or from other almost unavoidable impurities, they yet show
how considerable   are the differences which perfectly transparent
gases exhibit in reference to the property of transmitting heat.
This surprising dcportment, which           had alread     I
                                                        established
before   laid the <U+FB01>rst part of this treatise “ On the Conduction of
         I
Heat ” before the Academy, led me to make a separate investiga
tion of the radiation through gases, and <U+FB01>rst of all to ascertain
whether similar differences prevailed when another source of heat
was used.
                      A    Gas-<U+FB02>ame as source                  of Heat.
    Idesired <U+FB01>rst of all to use a source of heat at a higher tempe
rature, for which purpose the apparatus depicted in <U+FB01>g. 2, Plate
I. was un<U+FB01>tted.        I
                      was accordingly compelled to use the gases
in a tube closed at both ends by plates. In testing this method,
I had occasion to make some observations which have probably
also been made by others, but which           have nowhere found I
mentioned.
                     In<U+FB02>uence         of   the side       of the Tube.
    If therays from any source of heat be allowed to act upon a
thermo-pile without having passed through any tube, a smaller
de<U+FB02>ection is obtained than when the rays from the same source of
heat placed at the same distance from the thermo-pile are allowed
to pass through a tube open at both ends, that         not closed by       is,
any  kind  of  plate.  This  increased  action     obviously caused   is
 bythe rays re<U+FB02>ected from the inner side of the tube, so that the
thermo-pile     acted on, not only
                is                                   by
                                       the rays which come directly
from the source of heat, but also                by
                                      those which fall obliquely into
the tube and are again re<U+FB02>ected.       Even    the tube were black

cncd on the   inside, or    as  if,
                               was usually the case in the following

   The in<U+FB02>uence of the tube can, it is true, be diminished by
introducing diaphragms, which hinder the irradiation of the

diathermancy of gases      best seen from the following experi

   In these experiments strong gas-<U+FB02>ame with double draught,
                                a                            a
surrounded     by  aglass cylinder, was used as source of heat.
                                                         a                    It
was provided with         small parabolic metallic mirror, which re
                            a
<U+FB02>ected the rays of the lamp in such         manner that they passed
                                                  a
into  a  tube  1 metre long and 35 millims. in internal diameter,
at the other end of which was the above-named thermo-electric
  ile.   Between the tube and the lamp, and somewhat nearer the
Fetter, there was      screen consisting of two metal plates at
                        a                                          di     a
stance of 12 millims. from each other.        This could be removed
when the rays were to fall on the pile, and replaced as soon as
this was <U+FB01>nished.      Betw'een this screen and the tube was second  a
similar screen, which had an aperture 30 millims. square, the
centre of which was in         line with the axis of the tube.
                                a                                This
screen, which was always       in   <U+FB01>xed position, protected the rays
                                          a
of the lamp from the outside of the tube when the other was
removed.       There was another screen with          similar aperture
                                                          a
close to the thermo-pile and between         and the tube, the object
                                                   it
of which was to protect the pile from all external rays.
    When using this arrangement, the rays were allowed to pass
through    a  tube open at both ends, and lined with rough black
paper;     the  de<U+FB02>ection of the needle amounted to 24°‘7, corre
 sponding to 32-2 units. On removing the tube the de<U+FB02>ection
 was only 10°, corresponding        to 10.    If, after removing the
tube, the rays were allowed to pass through two glass plates                  4
millims. thick, placed at the same distance at which they would
be   if they closed the tube, the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle would
only be 1° to 2°. If, on the contrary, the blackened tube, as
the tube lined with black paper will for the future be called, was
between the glass plates, the de<U+FB02>ection increased to l2°'6, corre
sponding to 126.        If the tube closed with glass plates was not
blackened on the inside, the de<U+FB02>ection increased to 64°, corre
sponding to 320.
    From this      will be seen how greatly investigations on the
                   it
passage of heat-rays will be affected              by

   It is known that light presents a deportment entirely similar
to radiant heat.     It“ passed through a tube, it produces a far
greater illumination than without the use of a tube.      This phe
nomenon, which depends on repeated re<U+FB01>exion from the inner
side of the tube, is especially evident in the case of the so-called
liquid jet. Even if the tube is lined on the inside with black
paper, it produces, as                            I
                             have found, a very surprising increase

     In order the better to ascertain the in<U+FB02>uence of the side of the
 tube in the passage of heat-rays,      have investigated, in the case

    As the gas-<U+FB02>ame could not always be obtained of exactly the
 same intensity, the radiation of each individual gas was compared
 with that of atmospheric air, so that both were investigated
 directly after each other.    The relation between the two      given                                   is

    In all the experiments the tube was the same, as also were the
 glass plates      which     by
                             was closed.    The determinations were

the lamp itself at greater distances.    For it appeared not impro
bable that the values of the galvanometer corresponding to the
de<U+FB02>ections, which for greater de<U+FB02>ections are not capable of such
exact determination as for smaller ones, might have caused the
great difference in the radiation through rare<U+FB01>ed air, and through

temperature (not 2 per cent. of its volume at 16° C.) could exercise
no in<U+FB02>uence on the radiation, it appeared desirable to determine
experimentally that this supposition was correct.      “'ith this view
I  made comparative determinations        of the radiation through
perfectly dry air and through air entirely saturated with moisture.
The air was passed through several chloride of calcium tubes,
and afterwards, by means of a respirator, was drawn through the
unblackencd tube in such quantity that all the air previously in
the tube might be considered as displaced.        After the radiation
was determined, the air was   exhausted   by means   of the air-pump,
and fresh air admitted, which before entering had passed through
water slowly and in small bubbles.      This air was then exhausted,
and  a  fresh quantity  admitted   under   the same circumstances.
After moist air had been    thrice  successively admitted, it could
be assumed that the whole of the air contained in the tube at
the temperature 16° C., and pressure 764‘6 millims., was satu
rated with aqueous vapour.
   The capacity of dry air and moist air to transmit heat-rays of
100° C. was investigated in exactly the same way by means of
the apparatus described in page 87’.   In this way the following
results were obtained :—

   These experiments show that the water present in the atmo
sphere at 16° C. exercises no perceptible influence on the radia

the vapour separates as fog, appears very probable.

       GENTLEMEN,
           weeks ago            I
                          received a letter from Professor Joaquin
SOME
   Balcells     of Barcelona, stating that he had heard of a large
fall of meteorites, accompanied by tremendous detonations, said
to have taken place at Ca<U+FB01>ellas, near Villanova in Catalonia, at
some distance from Barcelona, on the 14th of May this year.
I have just received from him another letter dated the 27th of
June, enclosing an account of his expedition to Ca<U+FB01>ellas for the
purpose of procuring additional information, and also, if possible,
some specimens.             I
                       give the following translation of this part of
his letter :—
    “ There is no doubt that stones
                                            really fell on May 14 at
about l mu. ; but the greater number are lost, from having fallen
with such violence upon the arable land that they could not be
found. Two or three fell, however, upon rocks, which they
penetrated and cut up to a depth of 5 inches (pouces) in a direc
tion towards NE. at an angle of 45°. They broke into pieces with
a tremendous noise and great light.         The largest specimen only
weighed 18 ounces, and is already destined for the Natural
History Museum at Madrid. The second specimen which saw,              I
was destined for the Professor of Physics, Senor Arba of Barcelona.
I likewise saw other specimens of from 5 to 9 grammes in weight,
which were in the hands of the peasants, who would not part
with them at any price, because they fancied that these stones,
coming from heaven, would bring them good luck. From this
cause      I
         was only able to procure for myself one small fragment
of 5 grammes weight.”
    An aerolitic fall is mentioned in ‘ Cosmos’ for April 26, 1861,
as having taken place at Tocane St. Apre in Dordogne, France;
an ae'rolite fell on the 14th of February, 1861, with a streak of

        MY nnaa. MILLER,
 A       FEW days ago, after       a lecture at College on Cohesion and
           Adhesion, one of my pupils asked me,
                                                    “ What is the cause
of the remarkable agitation that takes place when sulphuric ether
is dropped on the surface of water?”           I put that same question
to myself more than <U+FB01>ve and twenty years ago while studying
chemistry, and made a large number of experiments on the sub
                          I
ject, some of which have lately had the pleasure of showing you.
As you were kind enough to express great interest in them, and
a desire that       I would complete the inquiry by pushing it to’a
de<U+FB01>nite conclusion,‘I have endeavoured to do so, and will with
your permission submit the whole inquiry to you from my own
point of view.
                                I
    But in order to do this must go back to the years 1837—38,
when      I  obtained a large number of results, and embodied them
in three Articles which are now before me in MS.              I   did not
 publish them, because the conclusions were not quite satisfactory
 to my own mind. But being engaged about that time in seeing
      ‘
my Students’ Manual of Natural Philosophy’ through the press,
 I included the principal experimental results in that work, where
 you will <U+FB01>nd them at pages 545—549, and again at pages 553—
 555.       The popular nature of this work doubtless caused these
 experiments to remain unknown to scienti<U+FB01>c men; and venture    I
 to think that they will even now strike many with an air of novelty.
 This is my excuse for a short summary of old results by way of
introduction to new ones, or, at least, to such as have not been
published.
                        * Communicated by Dr. Miller.

112              Mr. C. Tomlinson on    the Action of
    One of my <U+FB01>rst experiments, made with the view to ascertain
what takes place when ether is brought into contact withwater,was
the following  :-A    goblet being quite <U+FB01>lled with water was placed
                                                                       -
in a good light, and the <U+FB01>nger well wetted with ether was brought
down very near the surface.       On looking along this surface in
the direction of the light, a cup-shaped depression was evident.
I  then dusted the surface of the water with a light powder, such
as lycopodium, and on presenting the <U+FB01>nger wet with ether there
was a strong repulsive action; the powder was forcibly driven
aside, and the surface of the water was laid bare, evidently in a
state of agitation under the in<U+FB02>uence of the vapour of ether.       I
tried many sorts of powders with a similar result, but none
answered better than lycopodium.
    My next proceeding was to try to represent the action of the
ether by means of <U+FB01>lms of oily compounds formed by the spread
ing of an oily drop on the surface of water.      A large soda-water
glass was <U+FB01>rst employed, but a common white dinner-plate showed
the effects best.   Oil of turpentine, many of the turpentine var
nishes, such as gold-size, black Japan, carriage, copal, &c., make
admirable <U+FB01>lms.      Some of the <U+FB01>xed and essential oils also answer
very well.    In experiments of this kind, a single drop of the oily
substance must be gently placed on, or rather delivered to the
water without any fall or disturbance; otherwise the varnish,
8w. may sink below the surface in the form of a perfectly sphe
rical bead, and so remain as a good example of cohesion.          The
best method of obtaining a <U+FB01>lm is to dip a glass rod into one of
the oily liquids, and allow it to drain so that it may deliver only
a single drop to the surface of the water.      The plate <U+FB01>lled with
water should be placed before a good light, when a drop of the oily
substance, being gently placed on the centre, usually spreads
out with a beautiful exhibition of colour, or the <U+FB01>lm may be
quite colourless.    Take the latter case.    The <U+FB01>nger, or, what is
better, a <U+FB02>at piece of sponge tied with thread over the rounded
end of a glass stirring-rod, wetted with ether and held over the
<U+FB01>lm, produces a cup-shaped cavit , within which a beautiful set of
Newton’s rings may be seen so ong as the sponge is wet with
ether.    In this case the vapour of ether attenuates the <U+FB01>lm ; the
point immediately below the sponge is the point of greatest action,
and here the black of the centre of the <U+FB01>rst series of rings is seen :
the action diminishes from this depressed point, where the <U+FB01>lm is
thinnest, and it gradually increases in thickness until it unites
with the rest of the <U+FB01>lm, where colour ceases to be displayed.
The <U+FB01>lm is in fact under tension so long as the ether vapour is
acting upon it; and the tension is greatest in the direction of a
vertical ray from the sponge to the water, and gradually dimi
nishes as the rays increase in length from the sponge to the
     we,                              _

                     certain Vapour-s on Films,  Eye.              113
water.     Now as these thicknesses vary, for water, from about the
0'38 to the 57-75 millionths of an inch, the <U+FB01>lm gives all or some
of the series of colours known as Newton’s rings. In the second
place, supposing the drop of oil, Ste. to form a coloured <U+FB01>lm (and
most of the turpentine varnishes do so to perfection), the ether
sponge still developes a system of rings, not always beginning with
those of the <U+FB01>rst series, but exhibiting the colours of the second,
third, fourth, See. The diameter of the coloured rings on the oil
<U+FB01>lm may vary from I} of an inch to 2 or 3 inches, and in general
they close up and disappear as soon as the ether-sponge is re-
movad or gets dry.
    But not only was ether found to produce these effects, but also
liquor ammoniae, wood-spirit, alcohol, and naphtha, and, as           I
afterwards found, chloroform, benzole, bisulphide of carbon—in
fact any substance that throws o<U+FB02>' vapour with facility—when a
sponge wetted with one of these <U+FB02>uids was held over the <U+FB01>lm.
The eii'ects were not always so good as with ether, but each sub
stance had peculiar features of its own, and no two <U+FB01>lms of differ
 ent oils, &c. exhibited the same phenomena; indeed the <U+FB01>lms of
 the same substance would vary from day to day with varying tem
 peratures 0f the air and other causes.      It may be remarked that
 a sponge wetted with ammonia and held over the <U+FB01>lm often pro
 duced so violent an action as to break it up and scatter it about.
 It also forms with it a soapy compound which dissolves in the
 water.    Ether-vapour may also produce as violent an action as
 ammonia.      For example, a drop of oil of cinnamon produces on
 water a mottled <U+FB01>lm, reminding one of marbled paper. A sponge
 dipped in chloroform and held over the <U+FB01>lm, spreads it with a
 development of colour and incipient rings.        The ether-sponge is
 then powerfully repulsive, spreading, breaking up and scattering
 the numerous discs into which a single drop of the oil forms.
 But the ammonia-sponge occasions a remarkable spreading, rapid
 motion, producing <U+FB01>rst coloured rings, and then a granular soapy
 structure, after which all further action ceases, from the <U+FB01>lm_com
 bining with the water.
     In this way I accumulated a large number of results, which
 did not appear to throw much light upon the question as to what
 takes place between ether and water.           There seemed to be a
 repulsive action of some kind, and I tried to measure it by means
 of a delicately hung torsion-balance of straw, making the straw
 carry a piece of <U+FB01>ltering-paper which was saturated with water,
 while another piece of paper saturated with ether was brought
 up near to it; but 1 obtained no results in this way.         I there
 fore tried the action of ether on a thin sheet of Water just suf<U+FB01>
 cient to cover the surface of clean mercury in a wine glass, or
  spread over a glass disc 5 or 6 inches in diameter with a ledge of

114                    Mr. C. Tomlinson         on the   Aclion of
bees’-wax run round it.         On presenting the ether-sponge to the
centre of this sheet of water, the vapour drove away the water
and left a circular dry space in the centre of the mercury or of
the disc.     This is a striking experiment, especially on the sur
face of the mercury, which shows the effect very well, and allows
the thickness of the sheet of water to be somewhat greater than
on the glass.      The cohesion of the water is also Well shown by
its not closing up again when the ether-vapour is removed; but
it forms a beautiful circular pupil with a convex surface towards
the mercury.        If, instead of the sponge, a dropping-tube con
taining   ether   be  brought down to the surface of the water on the
glass disc, the water will open as before ; and on letting the ether
fall the water will be still further repelled, so as to form a more
convex ring round the liquid other than it did around its vapour.
Other volatile liquids produce different effects on this sheet of
water.     A single drop of creosote placed on the centre disperses
the water, and leaves a long irregular portion of the glass dry.
Several hundred drops of naphtha form a lenticular disc on
the water without displacing it.         A single drop of ether brought
down upon it disperses both naphtha and water, and <U+FB01>nds its
way to the glass, leaving a convex-bounded ring which slowly
closes in upon the dry space of glass.          But the mOst remarkable
result is with benzole: a disc of this being formed on the sheet
of water, and the ether-sponge held over                       it,
                                                          hollows      out it
Into  a  thick ring and holds        in that state for some time.

fact there    is   thick convex ring of benzole on water, the force

                        occupies          by
                                      itself as in   pit of solid matter.

The ammonia-sponge, when presented to the chloroform, drives
small globules of the latter out of the cavity, and forms with the
remainder     a soapy looking compound which permanently excludes
the water.
    Results of this kind, however curious, only served to con
vince me that          itfar more easy to multiply phenomena than
                            is
to discover laws.        Being strongly impressed with the idea of
repulsion which these results seemed to favour, tried the effects

striking experiments had not then been contrived; and my <U+FB01>rst
acquaintance with that class of phenomena was derived from
Dumas’s C/n'mie Alqiliquée, vol.          p. 31, where
                                               i.           described the

with spirits of wine,        saline   solutions, and     even mercury.   I
changed the nature of the hot surface, and found that ether
Would roll about on hot mercury, hot oil, and hot water.                 I
also found it perfectly easy to place a drop of water on rape or
olive-oil heated to about 400° or 500°.           All that was necessary
was to deliver the water gently from a dropping-tube to the oil
without any fall or splashing; it would then roll about for a
considerable    time.     If ether were also placed on the hot oil, it
would unite with the water and form a shell about it.
   When M. Boutigny showed his remarkable experiments in
your laboratory in 18~l5, you informed him of my results, and
he admitted that they were quite new to him.
   On trying some of the <U+FB01>xed oils on the surface of hot water
and mercury, turpentine on hot sulphuric acid, &c., the single
drop used for each experiment either became spheroidal, or <U+FB02>at
tened into a disc, the latter rotating on a vertical axis.        Experi
ments of this kind were connected in my mind with the motions
of camphor on the surface of water, as well as the agitation of
ether and other liquids.         I tried the effect of various vapours on
camphor    while   rotating   on  water; and the results <U+FB01>rst suggested
to me what    I  think is the key, if not the master-key, to these
                          I
experiments; for, as shall hereafter endeavour to show, elec
tricity has some share in these results.              A pellet of sponge
saturated with benzole held over a rotating piece of camphor,
had the effect of increasing the rotations of the smaller frag
ments to such an extent that the form of the camphor often
became quite indistinct, and appeared as a mere cloudy haze.
After an experiment of this kind, the morsel of camphor displays
one or two brilliant points where the structure is altered and the
light abundantly re<U+FB02>ected. These points are the effect of solu
tion.    The benzole vapour seizes the camphor and begins to dis
solve it; and during this action there is a contest between the
cohesion of the camphor and the <U+FB01>lm formed by the condensed
vapour of benzole, and the diffusive tendency of the water: there
is a contest, in fact, between cohesion and adhesion. The forma
tion of this <U+FB01>lm about the camphor may be plainly seen by
holding another sponge dipped. in chloroform instead of benzole
over camphor: it <U+FB01>rst produces a rapid spinning, the effect
of solution; but nearly as fast as the solution is formed the
camphor is displaced by the water, and a solid opake crust of
camphor is formed.          Bisulphide of carbon held over the spin
ning camphor drives it about; and when a drop of that sub-.
stance is placed on‘the water, it does not arrest the motions of
the camphor, but follows it about.           Persian naphtha causes the
camphor to spin more rapidly; and a drop of that substance
placed on the water will pursue the camphor with great swift

creosote; the cohesion of the creosote tends to prevent this
action, and the struggle between the two is manifested by a
series of vibrations which take place at the edge of the disc;
the creosote tends to spread, its cohesive force struggles to pre
vent the spreading.     Small globules, however, are constantly
being torn away from the parent drop, and as these spin round
and disappear, they leave a <U+FB01>lm which gradually covers more or
less of the surface of the water.    The motions of the parent
disc and of the globules cease; but as the <U+FB01>lm becomes dissolved
by the water, the motions (now very slow ones) set in again with
the formation of another <U+FB01>lm, which in its turn is dissolved.
But if the quantity of water be small, the globules soon cease to
be disturbed, since the water has become saturated, or the adhe
sion of the water balances the cohesion of the globule, and hence
the quiescence.
   When    I  showed you this experiment, it naturally struck you
as a case of solution, and you inquired whether the motions of
the disc would take place in a saturated solution.          I  had already
ascertained that          when one drop, or rather disc of creosote,
                          if,
is  in rapid agitation, and also moving about on the water,               a
second drop be placed            by

                     is                                   In other words,
the water      is sooner saturated.         further ascertained that
                                              1                          if,
when the discs of creosote are at rest in               small quantity of

water—a wine-glass full, for example—the contents of such
wine-glass were transferred to            half-pint goblet nearly full of
                                          a
water (the transfer being gently made, so as to keep the crco.
sotc on the surface), the motions of the discs will begin again
with as much energy as before.             When this half-pint of water
is  saturated and all motion has ceased, the motions will be re
newed   if  the half-pint of water be poured into           a large soda
water glass, two-thirds <U+FB01>lled with water.
   Thus,       byincreasing the quantity of water, we remove             it
further from the point of saturation, and favour the gyrations
and other motions of the creosote.             The same effect may be
produced   if  (the quantity     of  water  being   <U+FB01>xed) we increase its
solvent power.       For example,        disc
                                          a    of  creosote is  very lively
for some minutes on the surface of water; but as the latter be
comes saturated the motions decline, and then ccasc.                If    we

                           is
the creosote set in again.        So also these and other motions may
be produced     if we hold over the quiescent globule the vapours
of substances in which creosote             soluble.

    the globule while the latter is under the immediate in<U+FB02>uence of
    the gas.       The benzole sponge acts with remarkable energy,
     causing the creosote to spread to the utmost, verge of its cohe
     sion, and then to split with ajerking kind of motion.                 Bisul
     phide   of  carbon   has  also  a  powerful   action.     The   motions   are
     also exceedingly    curious   when  a drop  of one   of these  substances   is
     placed on the surface of water with the creosote, and about half
     an inch away from it.          There is an interchange of action be
     tween them, an apparent repulsion, but in fact a contest be?
     tween the solvent powers of the water and of the naphtha, &c.
     for the creosote.      If a drop of bisulphide of carbon be placed
     near the creosote, the former remains lenticular, and does not
    evaporate so quickly as when placed alone on water; the creo
     sote bombards it with a number of small globules, and is active
    only on the side nearest to it. If a drop of bisulphide be
    placed on either side of the creosote, the latter will carry on the
    bombardment from two sides.             A drop of benzole       is,in certain
    states   of  saturation   of  the  water,  so  exceedingly    active  that  it
    pursues the creosote, and attacks            it    with lifelike motions.
    The latter darts about as      if   seeking to escape from          it,
                                                                         and re
    minds one of an aquatic beetle pursuing its prey on the surface
    of   a pond.     These globules of creosote, benzole, &c., have thus
    a   decided action on each other, but the lenticular discs which
    they form on water do not coalesce; they often attract each
    other with increasing velocity up to           a certain point, and then
    repel  each   other, sailing slowly away      until the force of attraction
    brings them near together again.
        The phenomena may be further complicated               by  the action of
    vapours     on  the   two   dissimilar   lenses.    Thus    creosote  in ,the
    presence     ofa   naphtha globule may          be   very lively, and the
    ether-sponge held over the creosote may break                  it up with a
    very decided action, and yet have little or no action on the
    naphtha.
    I    should detain you too long were       to describe the varied
                                                   I
    phenomena of this kind.     They have an especial interest to me,
    because they led me to explain some of the other results partly
    by  the same laws of solution.   Thus one of my earliest experi
    ments—the repulsion     of  lycopodium dust on the surface of
    water    byether—was not altogether    case of repulsion, but also
                                               a
    of attraction—the attraction, in fact, of ether for water.    But
    <U+FB01>rst, as to repulsion. That many of these phenomena display
    repulsion cannot be denied        by
                                    any one who has witnessed them.
    The very circumstance of ether assuming so readily the vaporous
    state implies  astrong degree of repulsion.   As the ether leaves
    the saturated sponge, its comparatively feeble cohesion becomes
    changed into repulsion,    e. the liquid becomes vapour, which
                                 i.

                   certain Vapo-urs on Films,   g-c.             119
vapour being very heavy, falls down upon the excessively at—
tenuated <U+FB01>lm, whose thickness must be measured by millionths
of an inch.       This heavy repulsive vapour then sweeps aside
the <U+FB01>lm in a regular manner, producing in some cases a large
central opening, and then a thinning off of the <U+FB01>lm, suf
<U+FB01>cient to allow of the interference of the light required for the
phenomena of coloured rings.         This descending vapour, more
over, meets with an ascending vapour from the <U+FB01>lm, and the
contact of the two produces further complications in the way of
chemical and electrical effects which I will not ask you to con
sider at present.     I will only remark, <U+FB01>rst, that the electrical
condition of these vapours is very decided, and must be con
sidered before the explanation of these phenomena is at all
complete; and secondly, that during solution, as of a salt in
water, current electricity is (as I have reason to believe) largely
concerned in the action and in the motions of the solid in the
solvent.   But my immediate point is with the mechanical action
of this repulsive vapour from the wet sponge upon the <U+FB01>lm, the
light powders, and the mobile discs of creosote, &c. There is
a mechanical action about this vapour which goes some way to
explain the production of the rings. A stream of gas from a
gas-bottle produces them, and, what is equally remarkable, the
vapour of oil of turpentine will repel a turpentine <U+FB01>lm. A drop
of turpentine on water forms a good <U+FB01>lm, often at <U+FB01>rst without
colour, but as it evaporates it displays colour.       As soon, how
ever, as the <U+FB01>lm is formed, if a sponge dipped into the same
bottle from which the drop was taken be held over the <U+FB01>lm, it
will spread out into very beautiful rings.
   But now let us consider the in<U+FB02>uence of attraction. Ad
mitting for the moment that water becomes saturated with one
eighth of its bulk of ether, it will be found that there is a very
strong attraction between ether and its vapour for water up to
this point. The water quickly becomes saturated, but the com
bination up to saturation is very energetic, especially at <U+FB01>rst.
The great density of ether-vapour also assists the attractive force
of the water; it falls down, the water seizes          it,
                                                        and disperses
any dust or powder      that  may   be  in its way.   If   <U+FB01>lm of oil
                                                             a
or varnish be interposed,   it   begins to dissolve that, and thins
it out to the gradually decreasing thicknesses necessary to the
display of Newton’s rings, often making     a   complete perforation,
half an inch    in  diameter,  in the  <U+FB01>lm  to get to the water, and
showing the rings of colour at the inner edge of this perfo
ration.                                              .

boiled and <U+FB01>ltered, and, when cold, the surface was again dusted

of the powder, not so decidedly as with plain water, but still a
good repulsion.
   The solution of ether was also made to carry an oil-<U+FB01>lm.   A
drop of varnish formed an exquisite series of coloured rings,
and the ether-sponge also displayed some very beautiful rings;
but after a minute or two, when the adhesion between the solu
tion and the <U+FB01>lm was complete, the ether-sponge was power
less.
   It may also be mentioned that a vapour acts differently on
the <U+FB01>lm according as it has a greater attraction for the water or
for the <U+FB01>lm.      If
                  it has a strong attraction for the water, it will thin
out and disperse the <U+FB01>lm. If its attraction is strong for the <U+FB01>lm,
it will gather it up, thicken        it,
                                   and deprive      of colour.

with    <U+FB01>lm of oil of lavender the ether scatters and disperses,

while the benzole sponge thickens and attracts; in fact the
benzole vapour condenses into little discs, which unite with
the <U+FB01>lm.    So also      if
                          adrop of oil of peppermint be placed on
water,    spreads out into
         it                   honeycombcd <U+FB01>lm displaying colour.

      APPLI at the Thermomelric Station, Calton Hill.—The observa
tions on thermometers <U+FB01>xed by Professor Forbes at the different
depths in the rock of Caltou Hill, have been regularly continued
weekly till the present time by the staff of the Royal Edinburgh
Observatory, and regularly corrected to reduce to true tempera
tures of the bulbs, on the same system as before. Tables of these
corrected observations, for the twelve years 1842 to 1854 inclu
sive, having been supplied to me through the kindness of Professor
Piazzi Smyth,        I  have had the <U+FB01>rst. <U+FB01>ve terms of the harmonic
expression for each year determined in the following manner* :—
In the <U+FB01>rst place, the observations were laid down graphically,
 and an interpolating curve drawn through the points, according to
 the method of Professor Forbes. The four curves thus obtained
 represent the history of the varying temperature, at the four dif
 ferent depths respectively, as completely and accurately as it can
 be inferred from the weekly observations.           The space correspond
 ing to each year was then divided into thirty-two equal parts
 (the <U+FB01>rst point of division being taken at the begining of the
 year), and the corresponding temperatures were taken from the
 curve.     The eoe<U+FB02>icients of the double harmonic series (cosiues
 and sincs) for each year were calculated from these data, with
 the aid of the forms given by Mr. Archibald Smith, and pub
 lished by the Board of Admiralty, for deducing the harmonic
 expression of the error of a ship’s compass from observations on
 the thirty-two points. The general form of the harmonic expres
 sion being written thus—
   V=A°+AI        cos 27rl+   B, sin 21rI+A9    cos 4114-1-13, sin 41d +&c.,
 where V denotes the varying temperature to be expressed, and t
 the time, in terms of a year as unit. The following Table shows
 the results which were obtained, with the exception of the values
 of A0:—

    The values which were found for A0 should represent the
annual mean temperatures.          They di<U+FB01>'er.slightly from the an
nual means shown in the Royal Observatory Report, which, de
rived as they arc from a direct summation of all the weekly
observations, must be more accurate.         The variations, and the
<U+FB01>nal average values of these annual means, present topics for
investigation of the highest interest and importance, as I have
remarked elsewhere (see British Association’s Report, Section A,
Glasgow, 1855); but as they do not belong to the special sub
ject of the present paper, their consideration must be deferred
to a future occasion.
    18. Theoretical Discussion.—The mean value of the coef<U+FB01>cients
 in the last line of the Table being obtained from so considerable
a number of years, can be but very little in<U+FB02>uenced by irregu
 larities from year to year, and must therefore correspond to har
 monic functions for the different depths, which would express
 truly periodic variations of internal temperature consequent upon
 a continued periodical variation of temperature at the surface.
    19. According to the principle of the superposition of thermal
 conductions, the difference between this continuous harmonic
 function of <U+FB01>ve terms for any one of the depths, and the actual
 temperature there at the corresponding time of each year, would
 be the real temperature consequent upon a certain real variation
 of superficial temperature.     Hence the coefficients shown in the
 preceding Table afford the data, <U+FB01>rst by their mean values, to
 test the theory explained above for simple harmonic variations,
 and to estimate the conductivity of the soil or rock, as I propose
 now to do ; and secondly, as    I may attempt on a future occasion,
 to express analytically the residual variations which depend on
 the inequalities of climate from year to year, and to apply the
 mathematical theory of conduction to the non-periodic variations
 of internal temperature so expressed.
    20. Let us accordingly now consider the complex harmonic
 functions corresponding to the mean coef<U+FB01>cients of the preceding
 Table; and in the <U+FB01>rst place, let us reduce the double harmonic
 series in each case to series in each of which a single term repre
 sents the resultant simple harmonic variation of the period to
 which it corresponds, in the manner shown by the proposition
 and formula: of § 3 above.
    21. On looking to the annual and semiannual terms of the
 series so found, we see that their amplitudes diminish, and their
 epochs of maximum augment, with considerable regularity from
 the less to the greater depths.     The following Table shows, for
 the   annual terms,  the logarithmic rate of diminution of the am
 plitudes, and the rate of retardation of the epoch between the
 points of observation in order of depth :

there are certainly greater differences than can be attributed to
errors of observation.         Thus the means of the numbers in the two

follows :—

numbers which seem to indicate an essential tendency to dimi
nish at the greater depths.                   This tendency is shown very deci
dedly in each column separately; and it is also shown in each of
the corresponding columns, in tables given above, of results de
rived from Professor Forbes’s own series of a period of <U+FB01>ve years.
    23. There can be no doubt that this discrepance is not attri
butable to errors of observation, and it must therefore be owing
to deviation in the natural circumstances from those assumed for
the foundation of the mathematical formula.                                  In reality, none
of the conditions assumed in Fonricr’s solution is rigorously ful
<U+FB01>lled in the natural problem; and it becomes a most interesting
subject for investigation to discover to what particular violation
or violations of these conditions the remarkable and systematic
difference discovered between the deductions from the formula
and the results of observation is due.                              In the <U+FB01>rst place, the
formula is strictly applicable only to periodic variations, and the
natural variations of temperature are very far from being pre
cisely periodic; but if we take the average annual variation
through a suf<U+FB01>ciently great number of years, it may be fairly
presumed that irregularities from year to year will be eliminated :
and that the discrepance we have now to explain does not de

               Observations   of Underground Temperature.                125
pend on residual inequalities of this kind seems certain, from
the fact that it exists in the average of Professor Forbes’s <U+FB01>rst
<U+FB01>ve years’ series no less decidedly than in that of the period of
thirteen years following.
    24-. For the true explanation we must therefore look either to
inequalities (formal or physical) iu the surface at the locality,
or to inequalities of physical character of the rock below.                It
may be remarked, in the <U+FB01>rst place, that if the rates of diminu
tion of logarithmic amplitude and of retardation of epoch, while
less, as they both are, at the greater depths, remained exactly
equal to one another, the conductivity must obviously be greater,
and the speci<U+FB01>c heat less in the same proportion inversely, at
the greater depths.         For in that case, all that would be neces
sary to reconcile the results of observation with F ouricr’s formula,
would be to alter the scale of measurement of depths so as to
give a nominally constant rate of diminution of the logarithmic
amplitude and of the retardation of epoch; and the physical
explanation would be, that thicker strata at the greater depths,
and thinner strata at the less depths (all of equal horizontal
area), have all equal conducting powers and equal thermal capa
cities*.
    25. Now in reality, a portion, but only a portion, of the dis
crepance may be done away with in this manner; for while the
logarithmic amplitudes and the epochs each experience a some
what diminished rate of variation per French foot of descent at
the greater depths, this diminution is much greater for the for
mer than for the latter; so that, although the mean rates per_
foot on the whole 21 feet are as nearly as possible equal for the
two (being “1160 for the logarithmic amplitudes, and '1156 for
the epoch), the rate of variation of the logarithmic amplitude
exceeds that of the epoch by about 6 per cent. on the average of
the stratum of 3 to 6 feet; and falls short of it by somewhat
more than 2 per cent. in the lower stratum, 12 to 24 feet.                To
<U+FB01>nd how much of the discrepance is to be explained by the varia
tion of conductivity and specific heat in inverse proportion to
one another at the different depths, we may take the mean of the
   ‘  The “ conducting    power” of a solid plate is an expression of great
convenience, which 1 de<U+FB01>ne as the quantity of heat which it conducts per
unit of time when its two surfaces are permanently maintained at tempera
tures differing by unity.   In terms of this de<U+FB01>nition, the speci<U+FB01>c conduc
tivity of a substance may be de<U+FB01>ned as the conducting power per unit area
of a plate of unit thickness.   The conducting power of a plate is calculated
by multiplying the number which measures the speci<U+FB01>c conductivity of its
substance by its area, and dividing by its thickness.
   The thermal capacity ofa body may be de<U+FB01>ned as the quantity of heat
required to raise its mass a unit (or one degree) of temperature.         The
speci<U+FB01>c heat of a substance is the thermal capacity of a unit quantity of it,
which may be either a unit of weight or a unit of bulk.

depth, and alter the scale of longitudinal reckoning downwards,
so as to reduce the numerical measures of these rates to equality.
This, however, we shall not do in either the <U+FB01>ve years’ or the
thirteen years’ term, which we have hitherto considered sepa
rately, but for a harmonic annual variation representing the
average of the whole eighteen years 1837 to 1854.

plicitly shown above), derived from the <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve years’ average,
and multiplying by 5; taking similarly the coef<U+FB01>cients A], B1
for the succeeding thirteen years’ average, and multiplying by
13; adding each of the former products to the corresponding
one of the latter, and dividing by 18 ; we obtain, as the proper
average for the whole eighteen years, the values shown in the
following Table, in the columns headed A“ 13,.    The amplitudes

see  that the discrepancies are very much diminished; and we
cannot doubt that the conductive power of the rock         less in                                           is
the lower parts of the rock, and that the amount of the varia

        approximately represented     Table VII. We have, how by

consider variation in the value of kc as the only appreciable de

thermometric errors may have considerable in<U+FB02>uence, since there
is  necessarily some uncertainty in the corrections estimated for
the temperatures of the different portions of the columns of liquid
above the bulbs; and before putting much con<U+FB01>dence in the dis
crepancies we have found as true expressions of the deviations
 in the natural circumstances from Fourier’s cenditions, careful                       a
 estimate of the probable or possible amount of error in the ob
 served temperaturcs should be made.                That chn with perfect
 data of observation as great discrepancies should still be found
 in final reductions such as we have made, need not be unexpected
 when we consider the nature of the locality, which                 described     is
 by  Professor Forbes in the following terms :—
    The position chosen for placing the thermometer was below
 the surface “in the Observatory enclosure on the Calton Hill, at

             Observations    of Underground Temperature.             129
a height    of 350   feet  above the sea.     The rock is a porphyritic
trap, with    a somewhat      earthy  basis,  dull and tough fracture.
 The exact position is a few yards east of the little transit house.
There are also other buildings in the neighbourhood.        The ground
rises slightly to the east, and falls abruptly to the west at a di
stance of <U+FB01>fteen yards.       The immediate surface is <U+FB02>at, partly
covered with grass, partly with yravel*.”
    I have marked by italics those passages which describe circum        I
stances such as it appears to me might account for the discre-
panc1es   in question.
    31. Application to Semiannual Harmonic Terms—The har
monic expressions given above (§ 15) for the average periodic
variations for the three stations of Professor Forbes’s original
series of <U+FB01>ve years’ observations,          contain semiannual terms
which are obviously not in accordance with theory.            The retar
dations of epochs and the diminutions of amplitudes are, on the
whole, too irregular to be reconcileable by any supposition as
to the conductivities and specific heat of the soils and rocks
involved, or as to the possible elfects of irregularity of surface;
and in two of tlic three stations the amplitude of the semi
annual term is actually greater as found for the six-feet deep
than for the three-feet deep thermometer, which is clearly an im
possible result.     The careful manner in which the observations
have been made and corrected seems to preclude the supposition
that these discrepancies, especially for the three-feet and six-feet
thermometers,      for which the amplitudes of the semiannual
terms are from “28° to 74° (corresponding to variations of double
those amounts, or from "50° to 1°48), can be attributed to
errors in the data.       It must be concluded, therefore, that the
semiannual terms of those expressions do not represent any
truly periodic elements of variation, and that they rather depend
on irregularities of temperature in the individual years of the
term of observation.        Hence, until methods for investigating the
conduction inwards of non-periodic variations of temperature are
applied, we cannot consider that the special features of the pro
gress of temperature during the <U+FB01>ve years’ period at the three
stations, from which our apparent semiannual terms have been
derived, have been theoretically analysed.         But, as we have seen,
every irregularity depending         on individual years is perfectly
eliminated when the average annual variation over a suf<U+FB01>ciently
great number of years is taken.          Hence it becomes interesting
to examine particularly the semiannual terms for the eighteen
years’ average of the Calton Hill thermometers, which we now
proceed to do.

with the approach to agreement presented by these results, de
pending as they do on only eighteen years in all, and we may
espect that, when the average is of a still larger term of observa
tion, the discrepancies will be much diminished. In the mean
time we may regard the semiannual term we have found for
the three-feet deep thermometer as representing a true feature
of the yearly vicissitude ; and it will surely be interesting to <U+FB01>nd
whether it is a constant feature for the locality of Edinburgh, to
be reproduced on averages of subsequent terms of observation.
   34. It may be remarked that the nearer to the equator is the
locality, the greater relatively will be the semiannual term;
that within the tropics the semiannual term may predominate,
except at great depths; and that at the equator the tendency
is for the annual term to disappear altogether, and to leave a
semiannual term as the <U+FB01>rst in a harmonic expression of the
yearly vicissitude of temperature.     The facilities which under
ground observation a<U+FB02>'ords for the analysis of periodic variations
of temperature when the method of reduction which I have
adopted is followed, will, it is to be hoped, induce those who
have made similar observations in other localities to apply the
same kind of analysis to their results; and it is much to be
desired that the system of observing temperatures at two, if not
more depths below the surface may be generally adopted at all
meteorological stations, as it will be a most valuable means for
investigating the harmonic composition of the annual vicissitudes.

   35. Notwithstanding the dif<U+FB01>culty we have seen must attend
any attempt to investigate all the circumstances which must be
understood in order to reconcile perfectly the observed results
with theory, the general agreement which we have found is quite
suf<U+FB01>cient to allow us to form a very close estimate of the ratio of
the conductivity of the rock to its speci<U+FB01>c heat per unit of bulk.
Thus, according to the means deduced from the whole period of
eighteen years’ observation, the average rate of variation of the
logarithmic amplitude of the annual term through the whole
space of twenty-one feet is '1157, and of the epoch of the same
term, '1 154. The mean of these,_or '1156, can differ but very little

whole quantity of the refrigerating matter thus used to carry
away the heat conducted through the stratum must amount to
235,000 cubic feet for each square foot of area, which will be at

    39. To deduce the conductivities of the strata in terms of uni
form thermal units, Professor Forbes had the “ speci<U+FB01>c heats”
of the substances determined experimentally by M. Regnault.
The results, multiplied by the speci<U+FB01>c gravities, gave for the
thermal capacities of portions of the three substances, in terms
of that of an equal bulk of water, the values "5283, '3006, and
"1623 respectively.         Now these must be the values of c if the
thermal unit in which I: is measured is the thermal capacity of
a  French cubic foot of water.         Multiplying the values of g found
above by these values of c, we        <U+FB01>nd for k the following values :—

    Although many comparisons have been- made between the con
ducting powers of different substances, scarcely any data as to
thermal conductivity in absolute measure have been hitherto
published, except those of Professor Forbes, and probably none
approaching to their accuracy.            The slightly different numbers
to which we have been led by the preceding investigation are no
doubt still more accurate.
    40. To reduce these results to any other scale of linear mea‘
surcment, we must clearly alter them in the inverse ratio of' the
square of the absolute lengths chosen for the units*.                   The
   "  Because the absolute amount of heat <U+FB02>owing through the plate across
e nal areas  will be inversely as the thickness of the plate, and the effect
of equal quantities of heat in raising the temperature of equal areas of the
water will be inversely as the depth of the water. The same thing may be
perhaps more easily seen by referring to the elementary de<U+FB01>nition of ther
mal conductivity (footnote to § 11 above). The absolute quantity of heat
conducted across unit area of a plate of unit thickness, “ith its two sides
maintained at temperatures differing by always the Sillth amount, will be
directly as the areas, and inversely as the thickness, and therefore simply
as the absolute length chosen for unity.      But the thermal unit in which
these quantities are measured, being the capacity of a unit bulk of water, is

length of a French foot being 106575 of the British standard
foot, we  must   therefore multiply the preceding     numbers by
1'13581 to reduce them to convenient terms.
   41. We may, lastly, express them in terms of the most common
unit, which is the quantity of heat required to raise the tempera
ture of a grain of water by 1°; and to do this we have only to
multiply each of them by 7000 x 62447, being the weight of a.
cubic foot in grains.                     .

The reaction was terminated in two or three days ; the contents
were digested with strong alcohol, <U+FB01>ltered, and the alkaline
liquor neutralized with acetic acid and distilled. When the water
and alcohol had passed over, the thermometer rapidly rose, and
between 180° and 190° n colourless oily liquid distilled over,‘
which was found to have all the properties, physical and chemical,
of Wurtz’s propylglycol.
    Ordinary glycol was converted into alcohol by an analogous
process.       Hydrochloric glycol, diluted with half its volume of
water, was mixed with excess of sodium-amalgam.                   When left
at the ordinary temperature, it became converted into ordinary
alcohol; at a higher temperature the character of the reaction
was different, some oxide of ethylene being formed.                 The pro
duct of the reaction was distilled off in the water-bath, and the
distillate, dried by carbonate of potash and by caustic baryta,
was found to have the composition and properties of ordinary
alcohol.
    It is exceedingly      probable that the transformation of propylic
glycol into propylic alcohol would take place just in the same
way.
    Strcckcr has published* a very interesting investigation on
the relations between guanine,’lxanthine, caffeine, theobromine,
and creatinine.
    He describes a modi<U+FB01>cation of the method of preparing gna
 nine, and also describes some compounds which it forms with
 nitrate of silver and with baryta, and which are analogous to the
compounds with sareinc and xanthine.
    Unger found, by oxidizing guanine with chlorate of potash,
 that an acid was formed which had the formula C‘0 H5 N“ ()9,
 and which he named peruric acid.             These experiments have been
 repeated by      Strecltcr,   who   has  found    that the acid in question
 is parabanic acid, C6119 N9 06.            The mother-liquor contains, in
 addition to this, the hydrochlorate of a new organic base, which
 he calls guanidinc.         Itis a strengly alkaline body, which forms
 neutral crystalline salts with most acids. 'The free base is a cry
 stalline mass with a caustic taste, which rapidly attracts water
 and carbonic acid from the air, and thus is un<U+FB01>tted for direct
 analysis.      Its formula, (J2 H"7 N”, was determined from the ana
 lysis  of   its  platinum-salt, C9 H6 N3 HCl, PtClQ; its carbonate,
 C9 H‘stllO, (102; and its oxalate, C9 H5 N82HO, C4 H’ O“.

Streeker has indeed shown that theobromine may be converted
into caffeine, to which it bears the same relation as aniline t0
methylaniline. \Vhen theobromine is dissolved in ammonia, and
nitrate of silver added, a precipitate forms which readily dissolves
in warm ammonia.        On boiling this, a granular crystalline pre
cipitate is deposited, which  is theobrotnine-silver.     When this is
treated with   iodide of methylc,   iodide of silver is formed, and a
crystalline body, which is ca<U+FB02>eine:

Strecker attempted a similar transformation of xanthine into
theobromine by treating the silver compound of xanthine, which
contains 2 equivs. of silver, C'° H2 Ag” N‘2 04, with 2 equivs. of
iodide of methyle.    He obtained a body of the same composition
as theobromine,   but  which is simply isomeric, and not identical
with it.
   Gerhardt had already pointed out that choleslroplzane, a pro
duct of ‘the decomposition of caffeine, might be regarded as a bi
methylated parabanic acid; and from this point of view Hlasiwetz
endeavoured, but without success, to convert parabanic acid into
this body. Strecker, by treating parabanate of silver with iodide
of methyle, has succeeded in etfecting the change; that                              is,   by

terminations differ from those of preceding chemists—that                  is,   in
the quantities taken, which are very considerably larger than
those usually employed; the balances used were on correspond     8.

 mentioned that he found any kind of glass attacked when heated
directly  by  <U+FB02>ame  ;  but that, when protected            by

 dergoing any alteration in weight.       In all cases, where practi

     The present communication refers to the atomic weights of
 nitrogen, chlorine, sulphur, potassium, sodium, and silver, and
 their relation to the atomic weight of hydrogen. The author
 made for this purpose the synthesis of the following substances—
 chloride of silver, sulphide of silver, nitrate of silver, nitrate of
 lead, sulphate of lead; the analysis of chlorate of potash, and
 sulphate of silver and be determined the relations between the
                    ;
 atomic weights of the following substances :—silvcr and chloride
 of potassium, silver and chloride of ammonium, silver and chlo
 ride of sodium, nitrate of silver and chloride of potassium, nitrate
  of silver and chloride of ammonium.
   A    most essential point was the preparation of pure metallic
  silver. Several different methods were used, one of which con
  sisted in digesting   adilute solution of silver with <U+FB01>nely divided
  phosphorus.     This  actionis   slow, but the metal, after having
been digested with ammonia,        is
                                    quite pure.
   The synthesis of chloride of silver was effected           heating by
pure silver in current of chlorine, and expelling the excess of
                a
chlorine   by dry air. In three experiments there were obtained
for 100   parts of silver, 132'841, 132843, and 132-843 respect
ively of chloride of silver.    Chloride of silver was also prepared
by passing hydrochloric acid gas over the surface of solution of  a
silver in acid.   The precipitate was dried in the same vessel, and
fused in an atmosphere of hydrochloric acid.         Two experiments
of this kind, one of which was made      with  400  grammes of silver,
gave respectively 132-849 and 132846 of chloride of silver from
 100 parts of silver.     In another series the silver was dissolved
in nitric acid, and precipitated        by
                                         feeble excess of hydrochloric
                                             a
acid, washed, and     fused  in
                              a   current  of the gas. This gave for
 100 of silver 132'846 of chloride. In the last series, solution
of silver was precipitated   by  chloride of ammonium, the precipi

tate washed, dried, and fused in hydrochloric acid.                    From 100
of silver there  were   obtained       132848 and 132'8417 of chloride
of silver.
    The synthesis of nitrate of silver was effected by dissolving
 pure silver in nitric acid, evaporating to dryness in a Bohemian
 glass vessel, heating in a current of dry air, and fusion till con
stant.     The mean of eight experiments gave for the relation
between silver and nitrate of silver
                               100   :  157-492.
    Sulphuret of silver was prepared by heating a known weight
of silver, either in the vapour of pure sulphur or in sulphurettcd
hydrogen gas. In the mean of <U+FB01>ve experiments, 100 parts of
silver gave 114'8522 of sulphuret.
    The method for estimating the relation between the equivalents
of silver and of the chlorides of sodium, ammonium, and potas
sium, was that of Gay-Lussac.            It consisted in dissolving a known
weight of silver   in  nitric   acid,   and   adding an equivalent of the
chloride in question; the equivalents being calculated according
to Prout’s km       The excess of silver after precipitation, estimated
by   standard  solutions,   gave the required relations.
    The chloride of potassium was prepared either from carefully
puri<U+FB01>ed chlorate of potash, from platinochloride of potassium,
from nitrate of potash, or from tartrate of potash.                    The mean
of  19  experiments    with   quantities     of    pure   silver  varying from 3
to 32 grms., gave for     the   relation,
                        Ag: K 01:         100   :  69'103.
    Fourteen similar experiments with chloride of sodium led to
the relation
                      Ag : Na Cl = 100        :   54'2078.
    The relation between the equivalent of silver and that of chlo
ride of ammonium, as obtained from ten experiments, was
                    Ag: NH‘ Cl: 100 : 49-5944.

    The preparation of pure lead was attended with greater dif<U+FB01>
culties even than that of pure silver.              It was effected by digest
ing solution of acetate of lead in a leaden vessel with thin lead
foil until all copper and silver were precipitated.                    Sulphuric
acid was    then  added   so  as  to   form   sulphate       of  lead, which was

converted into carbonate by digestion with ammonia and carbon
ate of ammonia. This carbonate of lead was dried and reduced by
cyanide of potassium.    Pure lead was also obtained by the reduc
tion of the chloride, either by fusion with cyanide of potassium,
or with a mixture of cyanide and black <U+FB02>ux.
   The lead was converted into nitrate by heating it with strong
nitric acid until it was completely converted into nitrate, and
then evaporating to dryness in the same vessel in a current of
dry air at 140°.
   100 parts of lead gave 159-974- of nitrate of lead.
   The synthesis of sulphate of lead gave the relation

The analysis of chlorate of potash, that    the determination ofis,
the quantity of oxygen, was effected either      heating chlorate     by
of potash alone, or     heating  bywith  hydrochloric acid.

The analysis of sulphate of silver was effected   reduction with          by

   It will thus be seen that the atomic weights of nitrogen and
ammonium differ by 4'02 instead of by 4.         Hence if the syn
thesis of nitrate of silver is correct, the atomic weight of hy
drogen cannot be exactly one-eighth that of water.       The author
proposes to return to the synthesis of water, for his researches
lead him to believe that the error will be found there rather than
in the synthesis of nitrate of silver.
   Stas, who at the commencement of his researches had con
<U+FB01>dence in the hypothesis of Prout, has been led to the conclusion
that it is untenable, as well as the modi<U+FB01>cation introduced by
Dumas*. He says, in conclusion, “ So long as, in establishing the
laws of matter, we are to adhere to experiment, we must consi
der Prout’s law as an entire delusion, and must regard the un
decomposable bodies of our globe as distinct beings having no
relation to each other.    The undoubted analogy of properties
observed in certain elements must be sought for in other causes
than those derived from the ratio of the weight of their acting
masses.”
   In reference to Stas’s investigation, Marignac'l', in giving an
 abstract of          it,
                 objects to the conclusion as too absolute.      He
 says
       “ he can only form   clear  idea of the
                                             a degree of  con<U+FB01>dence
 which the determination of an atomic weight deserves when this
 weight has been obtained                             by
                                  several methods absolutely inde
 pendent of each other, based on the analysis of several distinct
c0mpounds.”_
   When M. Stas, as control of the synthesis of nitrate of silver,
                                     a
refers to the experiments                        by
                               which he determined the proportion
between this nitrate and the chloride     potassium, which latterof,
is directly connected  with silver, M. Marignac only sees    con                             a
<U+FB01>rmation of the exactitude of the experiments themselves, but                                    by

       M. Stas’ s New Determination of the Atomic      PVeig/zls.    143
    If, for instance, we suppose that nitrate of silver does not con
tain its elements exactly in the proportion of their atomic weights,
even the best methods for its analysis or synthesis will give with
the same inaccuracy the relation of this weight.
    In developing his ideas on this point, M. Marignae refers to
his own experiments on monohydrated sulphuric acid.               He has
shown that this compound, which was always considered very
stable, is really very unstable; it is only when it contains a
slight excess of water (1 per cent.) that it is quite stable, other
wise the least increase of temperature causes it to give off va
pours of anhydrous sulphuric acid.
    Who could say it priori that the sulphuret and nitrate of silver
are not capable of retaining at high temperatures a trace of sul
phur or nitric acid, seeing that sulphuric acid can retain a slight
excess of water far above 100°?
    Causes of error of this kind, to which others might be added,
lead M. Marignac to doubt whether the differences between ex
 periment and Prout’s law do not arise from the imperfection of
 experimental     methods.
     M. Mai-ignac has another objection against Stas’s conclusion.
 “If   the numbers of M. Stas do not absolutely coincide with
 those of Prout, they approximate to such an extent that they in
 fact cannot be considered accidental.        What has been said of
 Mariotte’s and Gay-Lusaac’s laws ma be applied to Prout’s
law's.    These laws, long considered abso ute, were found to be in
exact   when  the experiments were made with the accuracy attained
 by M. Regnault and by M. Maguus.              Nevertheless they will
 always be considered as expressing natural laws, whether from
 a practical point of view (for by their means the changes of
 volume in gases may be calculated with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy) or
 from the point of view of theory ; for they probably express the
 normal law of these changes of volume abstracted from some dis
 turbing in<U+FB02>uences, the effects of which may some day be calcu
 lated. The same may be believed of Prout’s law.”
     M. Marignac terminates his remarks by an observation due
 to Dumas :——The fundamental principle which led Prout to pro
 pound his law, that is to say, the idea of the unity of matter
 and all the conceptions which have been based on this principle,
 is quite independent of the magnitude of the unit which might
 serve as common divisor of the atomic weights.          \Vhether this
 weight    be that  of an  atom  of hydrogen,   of half or  a quarter of
 an atom, or     whether  it be any in<U+FB01>nitely  small fraction, all these
 considerations would nevertheless retain the same degree of pro
 bability.    The relations between the constitution merely become
 somewhat     less simple between the different elements.

XX.    Remark on the Taelic      of 9 Elements. By J. J. Svaas'ran,
   11111., F.R.S., Professor of Mal/rematics at His Royal Illililary
   Academy, lVoolwic/M.
        the end of my preceding paper in this Magazine for July,
AT I hazarded          an opinion that any grouping of 28 synthemes
comprising the 84 triads belonging to a system of 9 elements,
might be regarded as made up of 1 syntheme of monomial triads,
18 synthemes of binomial triads, and 9 of trinomial triads, the
denominations (monomial, binomial, and trinomial) having refer
ence to a duly chosen distribution of the 9 elements into 3 nomes
of 3 elements each. This conjecture is capable of being brought
to a very signi<U+FB01>cant, although not decisive test, by examining a
peculiar and important distribution of the 28 synthemes into 7
sets of 4 synthemes each, the property of each set being that its
12 triads contain amongst them all the 36 duads appertaining to
the 9 elements.         I discovered this mode of distribution very
many years ago; but it was <U+FB01>rst published independently by a
mathematician whose name          I forget, either in the Philosophical
Magazine    or in the    Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal,
I  think at some      time   between the years 1847—53.       A similar
mode of distribution exists for any system of elements of which
the number is a power of 3. \Vithout pausing to give the law of
formation, I shall simply observe that for 9 elements we may
take as a basic arrangement the square

and form from this, by a          ymmetrical method, the annexed six
derived arrangements :—

   If, now, we take any distribution of the 9 elements into nomes
other than 123, 456, 789, we shall <U+FB01>nd that some of the syn
themes will contain trinomials, some binomials only, but others
(in number either 9 or 18, according to the distribution chosen)
will contain binomials and trinomials mixed; but if we adopt
123, 456, 789 as the nomes, then it will be found that the
remaining 27 synthemes (after excluding the monomial syntheme
123, 456, 789) will consist of 18 purely binomial triads, and 9
purely trinomial triads.      The former will consist of the <U+FB01>rst,
second, and fourth synthemes of the 6 derived groups ; the latter
of the second, third, and fourth of the basic group, and of the
second synthemes of each of the 6 derived groups.
   It may be remembered that there are two types or species of
groupings of trinomial triad synthemes appertaining to 3 nomcs of
3 elements ; one of these species contains    the other 36 individual
                                                        4-,

                 may easily  be  ascertained that the grouping above
indicated belongs to  the <U+FB01>rst (the less  numerous) of these species.

  derived from any 6111141., I repeat that a “syntheme” is the general
  name for any consoeiation of the single or combined elements of
   a given system of elements in which each element is once and
  once only contained.         A name, from VE/MD (to divide), means a
  consociation of a certain number out of a given system of ele
   ments; and a binomial, trinomial, or r-nomial combination of
   any speci<U+FB01>ed sort, means a combination whose elements are dis
  persed between 2, 3, or r of the names between which the entire
   system of elements is supposed to have been divided.

 “         the Physical Basis of Solar Chemistry.”    By John Tyndall,
    ON Esq., F .R.S-,    Professor of Natural Philosophy,   Royal Insti
 tution.
    Omitting all preface, the speaker drew attention to an‘experi
 mental arrangement intended to prove that gaseous bodies radiate
 heat in different degrees.    Behind a double screen of polished tin
 was placed an ordinary ring gas-burner; on this was placed a. hot
 copper ball, from which a column of heated air ascended: behind
 the screen, but so placed that no ray from the ball could reach the
 instrument. was an excellent thermo-electric pile, connected by wires
 with a. very delicate galvanometer.     The thermo-electric pile was
 known to be an instrument whereby heat was applied to the genera
 tion of electric currents; the strength of the current being an accu
 rate measure of the quantity of the heat.     As long as both faces of
 the pile were at the same temperature no current was produced;
 but the slightest ditl'erence in the temperature of the two faces at
 once declared itself by the production of a current, which, when
 carried through the galvanometer, indicated by the de<U+FB02>ection of the
 needle both its strength and its direction.
    The two faces of the pile were in ,the <U+FB01>rst instance brought to the
 same temperature, the equilibrium being shown by the needle of the
 galvanometcr standing at zero. The rays emitted by the current of
 hot air already referred to were permitted to fall upon one of the
 faces of the pile; and an extremely slight movement of the needle
 showed that the radiation from the hot air, though sensible, was
 extremely feeble.    Connected with the ring-burner was a holder con
 taining oxygen gas; and by turning a cock, a stream of this gas was

    148                       Royal Institution   :—
    permitted to issue from the burner, strike the copper ballI and ascend
    in a heated column in front of the pile. The result was that oxygen
    showed itself, as a radiator of heat, to be quite as feeble as atmo
                                          ’
    spheric air'.
        A second holder containing ole<U+FB01>ant gas was also connected by
    its own system of tubes with the ring-burner.          Oxygen had already
    <U+FB02>owed over the ball and cooled it in some degree.              Hence, as a
    radiator in comparison with oxygen, the ole<U+FB01>ant gas laboured under a
     disadvantage.      It was purposely arranged that this should be the
    case; so that   if,  notwithstanding its being less hot, the ole<U+FB01>ant gas
    showed itself better radiator, its claim to superiority in this respect
                   a
    would be decisively proved. On permitting the gas to issue upwards,
    it  cast an amount of heat against the adjacent face of the pile suf<U+FB01>cient
    to impel the needle of the galvanometer almost to its stops at 90°.
    This experiment proved the vast dilTerence between two equally
     transparent gases with regard to their power of emitting radiant
    heat.
        The converse experiment was now performed. The thermo-eleetric
    pile was removed and placed between two cubes <U+FB01>lled with water kept
     in a state of constant ebullition; and it  was so arranged that the quan
    tities of heat falling from the cubes on the opposite faces of the pile
    were exactly equal, thus neutralizing each other. The needle of the
    galvanometer being at zero, a sheet of oxygen gas was caused to issue
    from slit between one of the cubes and the adjacent face of the pile.
          a
     If this sheet of gas possessed any sensible power of intercepting the
     thermal rays from the cube, one face of the pile being deprived of the
    heat thus intercepted,    a    difference of temperature between its two
    faces would instantly set in, and the result would be declared by the
    galvanometer.        The quantity absorbed by the oxygen under those
    circumstances was too feeble to affect the galvanometer; the gas, in
    fact, proved sensibly transparent to the rays of heat.         It had but  a
    feeble power     of radiation; it   had an equally feeble power of absorp
    tion.
        The pile remaining in its position,      a   sheet of ole<U+FB01>ant gas was
‘   caused to issue from the same slit as that through which the oxygen
     had passed.     No one present could see the gas;    it was quite invisible,
     the light went through   it   as freely as through oxygen or air, but its
     effect upon the thermal rays emanating from the cube was what
     might be expected from    a    sheet of metal.    A quantity so large was
     cut off that the needle of the galvanometer, promptly quitting the zero
    line, moved with energy to its stops. Thus the ole<U+FB01>ant gas, so light
     and clear and pervious to luminous rays, was most potent destroyer
                                                      a
     of the rays emanating from an obscure source. The reciprocity of
     action established in the case of oxygen comes out here; the good
    radiator  is  found by this experiment to be the good absorber.
        This result, which was exhibited before a public audience this
    evening for the <U+FB01>rst time, was typical of what had been obtained with
    gases generally.       Going through the entire list of gases and vapours
    in this way, we should <U+FB01>nd radiation and absorption to be as rigidly
    associated as positive and negative in electricity, or as north and south

        Prof. Tyndall on     the  Physical Basis    of Solar Chemistry.    149
   polarity in magnetism.        The  gas which, when heated, is most com
   petent to generate a calori<U+FB01>c ray, is precisely that which is most com
   petent to stop such a ray.       If  the radiation be high, the absorption
   is high; if the radiation be moderate, the absorption is moderate; if
   the radiation be low, the absorption is low; so that if we make the
   number which expresses the absorptive power the numerator of a frac
   tion, and that which expresses its radiative power the denominator,
   the result would be that, on account of the numerator and denomi
  nator varying in the same proportion, the value of that fraction would
  always remain the same, whatever might be the gas or vapour expe
  rimented with.
      But why should this reciprocity exist? What is the meaning of
  absorption? what is the meaning of radiation? \Vhen you cast a
  stone into still water, rings of waves surround the place where it falls;
  motion is radiated on all sides from the centre of disturbance.       When
  the hammer strikes a bell, the latter vibrates; and sound, which is
  nothing more than an undulatory motion of the air, is radiated in all
  directions.     Modern philosophy reduces light and heat to the same
  mechanical category.         A luminous body is one with its particles in
  a state of vibration ; a hot body is one with its particles also vibrating,
  but at a rate which is incompetent to excite the sense of vision; and
  as a sounding body has the air around it, through which it propagates
  its vibrations, so also the luminous or heated body has a medium
  called tether, which accepts its motions and carries them forward
  with inconceivable velocity.       Radiation, then, as regards both light
 and heat, is the transference of motion from the vibrating body to the
 rather in which it swings; and, as in the case of sound, the motion
 imparted to the air is soon transferred to the surrounding objects,
 against which the aerial undulations strike, the sound being, in
 technical language, absorbed, so also with regard to light and heat,
 absorption consists in the transference of motion from the agitated
 rather to the particles ofthe absorbing body.
     The simple atoms are found to be bad radiators; the compound
 atoms good ones: and the higher the degree of complexity in the
 atomic grouping, the more potent, as a general rule, is the radiation
 and absorption.        Let us get de<U+FB01>nite ideas here, however gross, and
purify    them   afterwards   by the process of abstraction.     Imagine our
simple    atoms   swinging   like single spheres in the tether; they cannot
create the swell which a group of them united to form a system can
produce.      An oar runs freely edgeways through the water, and im
parts   far less  of its motion to the water than when its broad <U+FB02>at side
is brought to bear upon it. In our present language the oar, broad
side vertical, is a good radiator; broad side horizontal, it is a bad
radiator.     Conversely, the waves of water, impinging upon the <U+FB02>at
face of the oar-blade, will impart a greater amount of motion to it
than when impinging upon the edge.              In the position in which the
oar radiates well it also absorbs well.        Simple atoms glide through
the nether without much resistance; compound ones encounter this,
and yield up more speedily their motion to the aether. Mix oxygen
and nitrogen mechanically, they absorb and radiate a certain amount.

150                        Royal Instilulion  :—
Cause these gases to combine chemically and form nitrous oxide, both
the absorption and radiation are thereby augmented 250 times!
     In this way we look with the telescope of the intellect into atomic
systems, and obtain a conception of processes which the eye of sense
can never reach. But gases and vapours possess a power of choice
as to the rays which they absorb.      They single out certain groups of
rays for destruction, and allow other groups to pass unharmed.       This
is best illustrated by a famous experiment of Sir David Brewster’s,
modi<U+FB01>ed to suit the requirements of the present discourse.         Into a
glass cylinder, with its ends stopped by discs of plate glass, a small
quantity of nitrous acid gas was introduced, the presence of the gas
being indicated by its rich brown colour. The beam from an electric
lamp being sent through two prisms of bisulphide of carbon, a spec
 trum 7 feet long and 18 inches wide was cast upon a screen.          In
 troducing the cylinder containing the nitrous acid into the path of
 the beam as it issued from the lamp, the splendid and continuous
 spectrum became instantly furrowed by numerous dark bands, the
 rays answering to which were struck down by the nitric gas, while
 it permitted the light which fell upon the intervening spaces to pass
 with comparative impunity.         _
      Here also the principle of reciprocity, as regards radiation and
 absorption, holds good; and could we, without otherwise altering its
 physical character, render that nitrous gas luminous, we should <U+FB01>nd
 that the very rays which it absorbs are precisely those which it would
  emit. When atmospheric air and other gases are brought to a state
 of intense incandescence by the passage of an electric spark, the
  spectra which we obtain from them consist of a series of bright bands.
  But such spectra are produced with the greatest brilliancy when,
 instead of ordinary gases, we make use of metals heated so highly as
  to volatilize them. This is easily done by the voltaic current.       A
  capsule of carbon was <U+FB01>lled with mercury, which formed the positive
  electrode of the electric lamp; a carbon-point was brought down upon
  this ; and on separating one from the other, a brilliant arc containing
  the mercury in a volatilized condition passed between them. The
  spectrum of this are was not continuous like that from the solid carbon
  points, but consisted of a series of vivid bands, each corresponding
  in colour to that particular portion of the spectrum to which its rays
  belonged.     Copper gave its system of bands; zinc gave its system -,
   and brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc, gave a splendid
   spectrum made up of the bands belonging to both metals.
      Not only, however, when metals are united like zinc and copper
   to form an alloy is it possible to obtain the bands which belonged to
   them.     No matter how we may disguise the metal—allowing it to
   unite with oxygen to form an oxide, and this again with an acid to
   form a salt; if the heat applied be suf<U+FB01>ciently intense, the bands
   belonging to the metal reveal themselves with perfect de<U+FB01>nition.
   Holes were drilled in a cylinder of retort carbon, and, these being
   <U+FB01>lled with pure culinary salt, the carbon was. made the positive elec—
   trode of the lamp; the resultant spectrum showed the brilliant yellow
   lines of the metal sodium.    Similar experiments were made with the

      l’rof. Tyndall on     the Physical Basis of Solar Chemistry.           151
chlorides of strontium, calcium, lithium', and other metals; each
salt gave the bands due to the metal. Different salts were then
mixed together and rammed into the holes in the carbon; a spectrum
was obtained which contained the bands of them all.
    The position of these bright bands never varies; and each metal
has its own system.         Hence the competent observer can infer from
the bands of the spectrum the metals which produce it.               It is a lan
guage addressed to the eye instead of the ear; and the certainty
would not be augmented if each metal possessed the power of
audibly calling out,       “I  am here!"      Nor is this language affected
by distance.       If we find that the sun or the stars give us the bands
of our terrestrial metals, it is a declaration on the part of these orbs
that such metals enter into their composition.             Does the sun give
us any such intimation? Does the solar spectrum exhibit bright
lines which we might compare with those produced by our terrestrial
metals, and prove either their identity or difference? No. The
solar spectrum, when closely examined, gives us a multitude of tine
 dark lines instead of bright ones.         They were <U+FB01>rst' noticed by Dr.
 Wollaston, were investigated with profound skill by Fraunhofer, and
named from him F raunhofer’s lines. They have been long a standing
puzzle to philosophers.         The bright lines which the metals give us
 have been also known to us for years; but the connexion between
 both classes of phenomena was wholly unknown, until Kirchhoff,
 with admirable acuteness, revealed the secret, and placed it at the
 same time in our power to chemically analyse the sun.
     We have now some hard work before us; hitherto we have been
 delighted by objects which addressed themselves rather to our aesthetic
 taste than to our scienti<U+FB01>c faculty.          We have ridden pleasantly to
 the base of the <U+FB01>nal cone of Etna, and must now dismount and march
 wearily through ashes and lava, if we would enjoy the prospect from
 the summit.        Our problem is to connect the dark lines of Fraunhofer
 with the bright ones of the metals. The white beam of the lamp is
 refracted in passing through our two prisms, but its different com
 ponents are refracted in different degrees, and thus its colours are
 drawn apart. Now the colour depends solely upon the rate of oscil
 lation of the particles of the luminous body,—red light being pro
  duced by one rate, blue light by a much quicker rate, and the colours
  between red and blue by the intermediate rates. The solid incan
  descent coal-points give us a continuous spectrum; or, in other
  words, they emit rays of all possible periods between the two ex
  tremes of the spectrum. They have particles oscillating so :s to
  produce red; others to produce orange; others to produce yellow,
  green, blue, indigo, and violet respectively.           Colour, as many of
  you know, is to light what pitch is to sound. \Vhen a violin-player
     " The   vividncss of the colours of the lithium spectrum is extraordinary:

 presses his <U+FB01>nger on a string he makes it shorter and tighter, and
 thus, causing it to vibrate more speedily, augments the pitch.     lma~
 gine such a player to move his <U+FB01>nger slowly along the string, short
 ening it gradually as he draws his how, the note would rise in pitch
 by a. regular gradation; there would be no gap intervening between
 note and note. Here we have the analogue to the continuous spec
 trum, whose colours insensibly blend together without gap or in
 terruption, from the red of the lowest pitch to the violet of the
 highest.    But suppose the player, instead of gradually shortening
 his string, to press his <U+FB01>nger on a certain point, and to sound
 the corresponding note; then to pass on to another point more or
less distant, and sound its note; then to another, and so on, thus
 sounding particular notes separated from each other by gaps which
correspond to the intervals of the string passed over; we should
then have the exact analogue of a spectrum composed of separate
bright bands with intervals of darkness between them. But this,
though a perfectly true and intelligible analogy, is not suf<U+FB01>cient for
our purpose ; we must look with the mind's eye at the very oscillating
atoms of the volatilized metal. Figure these atoms connected by
springs of a certain tension, and which, if the atoms are squeezed
together, push them asunder, or, if the atoms are drawn apart, pull
them together, causing them, before coming to rest, to quiver at a
certain de<U+FB01>nite rate determined by the strength of the spring.      Now
the volatilized metal which gives us one bright band is to be <U+FB01>gured
as having its atoms united by springs all of the same tension, its
vibrations are all of one kind.    The metal which gives us two bands
may be <U+FB01>gured as having some of its atoms united by springs of one
tension, and others by a second series of springs of a different ten
sion.    Its vibrations are of two distinct kinds ; so also when we have
three or more bands, we are to <U+FB01>gure as many distinct sets of springs,
each set capable of vibrating in its own particular time and at a dif
ferent rate from the other. If we seize this idea de<U+FB01>nitely, we shall
have no dif<U+FB01>culty in dropping the metaphor of springs, and substi
tuting for it mentally the forces by which the atoms act upon each
other.     Having thus far cleared our way, let us make another effort
to advance.
  Here is       a   pendulum,—aheavy ivory ball suspended from a string.
I blow against this ball;      single puff of my breath moves it a little
                                  a
way   from  its position of rest; it swings back towards me, and when
it reaches the limit ofits swing l puff again. It now swings further;
and thus by timing my puffs I can so accumulate their action as to
produce oscillations of large amplitude.        The ivory ball here has
absorbed the motions which my breath communicated to the air.           I
now bring the ball to rest. Suppose, instead of my breath, a wave
of air to strike against     it,
                              and that this wave     followed by
                                                      is        a  series
of others which succeed each other exactly in the same intervals as
my puffs;       itperfectly manifest that these waves would communi
                     is
cate their motion to the ball and cause     it to swing as the puffs did.
And   it   equally manifest that this would not he the case
           is                                                 if the im
pulses of the waves were not properly timed; for then the motion

     Prof. Tyndall   on the Physical Basis of Solar Chemistry.     153
imparted to the pendulum by one wave would be neutralized by an
other, and there could not be that accumulation of effect which we
have when the periods of the waves correspond with the periods of
the pendulum.      So much for the kind of impulses absorbed by the
pendulum.     But such a pendulum set, oscillating in air produces
waves in the air; and we see that the waves which it produces must
be of the same period as those whose motions it would take up or
absorb most copiously if they struck against it.      Just in passing I
may remark that, if the periods of the waves be double, treble,
quadruple, &c. the periods of the pendulum, the shocks imparted to
the latter would also be so timed as to produce an accumulation of
motion.
    Perhaps the most curious effect of these timed impulses ever de
scribed was that observed by a watchmaker named Ellicott, in the
year 1741. He set two clocks leaning against the same rail; one
of them, which we may call A, was set going; the other, B, not.
Some time afterwards he found, to his surprise, that B was ticking
also.   The pendulums being of the same length, the shocks imparted
by the ticking of A to the rail against which both clocks rested were
propagated to B, and were so timed as to set B going.     Other curious
effects were at the same time observed.     When the pendulum dif
fered from each other a certain amount, A set E going, but the reac
tion of B stopped A. Then B set A going, and the reaction of A
 stopped B.    If the periods of oscillation were close to each other,
but still not quite alike. the clocks mutually controlled each other,
 and by a kind of mutual compromise they ticked in perfect unison.
    But what has all this to do with our present subject? They are
 mechanically identical.    The varied actions of the universe are all
 modes of motion ; and the vibration of a ray claims strict brotherhood
 with the vibrations of our pendulum. Suppose zethereal waves stri
king upon atoms which oscillate in the same periods as the waves
 succeed each other, the motion of the waves will be absorbed by the
 atoms; suppose we send our beam of white light through a sodium
 <U+FB02>ame, the particles of that <U+FB02>ame will be chie<U+FB02>y affected by those un
 dulations which are synchronous with their own periods of vibration.
 There will be on the part of those particular rays a transference of
 motion from the agitated ether to the atoms of the volatilized sodium,
 which, as already de<U+FB01>ned, is absorption. \Ve use glass screens to
 defend us from the heat of our <U+FB01>res; how do they act? Thus :—
 The heat emanating from the <U+FB01>re is for the most part due to radia
 tions which are incompetent to exeite the sense of vision; we call
 these rays obscure.     Glass, though pervious to the luminous rays,
 is opake in a high degree to those obscure rays, and cuts them off,
 while the cheerful light of the <U+FB01>re is allowed to pass. Now mark
 me clearly.    The heat cut off from your person is to be found in the
 glass, the latter becomes heated and radiates towards your person;
 what, then, is the use of the glass if it merely thus acts as a tempo
 rary halting-place for the rays, and sends them on afterwards? It
 does this :—it not only sends the heat it receives towards you. but

154                       Royal Institution    :—
scatters it also in all other directions round the room. Thus the
rays which, were the glass not interposed, would be shot directly
against your person, are for the most part diverted from their original
direction, and you are preserved from their impact.
   Now for our experiment.       I pass the beam from the electric lamp
through    the two  prisms. and  the   spectrum spreads its colours upon
the screen.     Between the lamp and the prism I interpose this snap
dragon light. Alcohol and water are here mixed up with a quantity
of common salt, and the metal dish that contains them is heated by
a spirit-lamp.    The vapour from the mixture ignites, and we have
this monochromatic <U+FB02>ame.        Through this <U+FB02>ame the beam from the
lamp   is  now   passing; and   observe   the result upon the spectrum.
You see a dark band cut out of the yellow,—not very dark, but suf
<U+FB01>ciently so to be seen by everybody present. Observe how the
band quivers and varies in shade as the amount of yellow light cut
off by the unsteady <U+FB02>ame varies in amount.        The <U+FB02>ame of this mono
chromatic lamp is at the present moment casting its proper yellowlight
upon that shaded line; and more than this, it casts in part the light
which it absorbs from the electric lamp upon it; but it scatters the
greater portion of this light in other directions, and thus withdraws
it from its place upon the screen; as the glass, in the case above sup
posed, diverted the heat of the <U+FB01>re from your person.           Hence the
band appears dark; not absolutely, but dark in comparison with the
adjacent brilliant portions of the spectrum.
   But let me exalt this effect.     I place in front of the electric lamp
the intense <U+FB02>ame of a large Bunscn's burner.        I have here a platinum
capsule into which I put a bit of sodium less than a pea in magni
tude. The sodium placed in the <U+FB02>ame soon volatilizes and burns
with brilliant incandescence. Observe the spectrum. The yellow
band is clearly and sharply cut out, and a band of intense obscurity
occupies its place. I withdraw the sodium, the brilliant yellow of
the spectrum takes its proper place: I reintroduce the sodium, and
the black band appears.
    Let me be more precise :—The yellow colour of the spectrum ex
tends over a sensible space, blending on one side into orange and on
 the other into green. The term “ yellow band” is therefore some
what inde<U+FB01>nite.      I want to show you that it is the precise yellow
band emitted by the volatilized sodium which the same substance
absorbs.     By dipping the coal-point used for the positive electrode
into a solution of common salt. and replacing it in the lamp, I obtain
that bright yellow band which you now see drawn across the spec
trum.     Observe the fate of that band when I interpose my sodium
light. ltis <U+FB01>rst obliterated, and instantly that black streak occupies
its place. See how it alternately <U+FB02>ashes and vanishes as I withdraw
and introduce the sodium <U+FB02>ame!
   And supposing that instead of the <U+FB02>ame of sodium alone I intro
duce into the path of the beam a <U+FB02>ame in which lithium, strontium,
magnesium, calcium, &c. are in a state of volatilization, each metallic
vapour would cut out its own system of bands, each corresponding
exactly in position with the bright band which that metal itself would

    Prof'. Tyndall an the Physical Basis    of Solar Chemistry.    155
east upon the screen.     The light of our electric lamp then shining
through such a composite <U+FB02>ame would give us a. spectrum cut up by
dark lines, exactly as the solar spectrum is cut up by the lines of
Fraunhofer.
    And hence we infer the constitution of the great centre of our
system.     The sun consists of a nucleus which is surrounded by a
<U+FB02>aming atmOsphere.       The light of the nucleus would give us a con
tinuous spectrum, as our common coal-points did ; but having to pass
through the photosphere, as our beam through the <U+FB02>ame, those rays
of the nucleus which the photosphere can itself emit are absorbed, and
shaded spaces, corresponding to the particular rays absorbed, occur
in the spectrum. Abolish the solar nucleus, and we should have a
spectrum showing a bright band in the place of every dark line of
Fraunhofer. These lines are therefore not absolutely dark, but dark
by an amount corresponding to the difference between the light of the
 nucleus intercepted by the photosphere, and the light which issues
 from the latter.
     The man to whom we owe this beautiful generalization is Kirch
 ho<U+FB01>‘, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Heidelberg;
 but, like every other great discovery, it is compounded of various ele
 ments. Mr. Talbot observed the bright lines in the spectra of coloured
 <U+FB02>ames. Sixteen years ago Dr. Miller gave drawings and descriptions
 of the spectra of various coloured <U+FB02>ames. Wheatstone, with his accus
 tomed ingenuity, analysed the light of the electric spark, and showed
 that the metals between which the spark passed determined the bright
 bands in the spectrum of the spark. Masson published a prize essay
  on these bands; Van der Vl'illigen, and more recently Pliicker, have
  given us beautiful drawings of the spectra obtained from the dis
  charge of Ruhmkorff’s coil.      But none of these distinguished men
  betrayed   the least knowledge of the connexion between the bright
  bands of the metals and the dark lines of the solar spectrum.     The
  man who came nearest to the philosophy of the subject was Angstrom.
  In a paper translated from Poggendor<U+FB01>’s Annalen by myself, and
  published in the Philosophical Magazine for 1855, he indicates that
  the rays which a body absorbs are precisely those which it can emit
  when rendered luminous.      In another place he speaks of one of his
  spectra giving the general impression of reversal of the solar spec
  trum.    Foucault, Stokes, and Thomson have all been very close to
  the discovery; and, for my own part, the examination of the radia
  tion and absorption of heat by gases and vapours, some of the results
  of which I placed before you at the commencement of this discourse,
  would have led me in 1859 to the law on which all _Kirchhoi¥’s spe
  culations are founded, had not an accident withdrawn me from the
  investigation.   But Kirchhofs claims are unaffected by these cir
  cumstances. True, much that I have referred to formed the neces
  sary basis of his discovery; so did the laws of Kepler furnish to
  Newton the basis of the theory of gravitation.     But what Kirchhoff
  has done carries us far beyond all that had before been accomplished.
  He has introduced the order of law amid a vast assemblage of empi

rical observations, and has ennobled our previous knowledge by
showing its relationship to some of the most sublime of natural
 phenomena.
   Postscript, July 24.—As far back as the year 1822 Sir John
 Herschel described the spectra of various coloured <U+FB02>ames in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.          In his “ Treatise
on Light" in the Encycl. lllelropol., published in 1827,he describes the
spectra derived from the introduction of various salts into <U+FB02>ames,
and <U+FB01>nds exactly as Bunsen and Kirchhoff have recently found, the
muriates most suitable for such experiments, on account of their
volatility.   He also adds the distinct statement, that “ the colours

    “ Contributions towards the History of the Monamines."—No. III.
Compound Ammonias by Inverse Substitution. By A. W. Hofmann,
LL.D., F.R.S.     820.    Received  July  24, 1860.           '
                       I
   Many years ago showed that the bromide or iodide of a quartary
ammonium splits under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat into the bromide or
iodide of an alcohol-radical on the one hand, and a tertiary monamine
on the other.
   Having lately returned to the study of this class of substances,      I
was led to examine the deportment, under the in<U+FB02>uence of heat, of
the tertiary, secondary, and, lastly, of the primary monammonium
salts.
   Experiment has shown that these substances undergo an ana
logous decomposition.        The chloride of a tertiary monammonium
when submitted to distillation yields, together with the chloride of an
alcohol-radical, a secondary monamine; the chloride of a secondary
monammonium, together with an alcohol‘chloride, a primary mona
mine; "lastly, the chloride of a primary monammouium, the chloride
of an alcohol-radical and ammonia.
   Exactly, then, as my former experiments show that we may rise in
the scale by replacing the four equivalents of hydrogen in ammonium
one by one by radicals, so it is obvious from these new experiments
that we may also step by step descend, by substituting again hy
drogen for the radicals in succession.

point    of view, admit of but limited application in practice. The
purity of the result is disturbed by several circumstances, which
it is dif<U+FB01>cult to exclude. Unless the temperature be suf<U+FB01>ciently
high, a small portion of the ammonium-salt submitted to distillation
sublimes without change; again, a portion of the same salt is repro
duced in the neck of the retort and in the receiver', from the very
constituents into which it splits; lastly, if the temperature be too
high, the chloride of ethyle is apt to be decomposed into ethylene
and hydrochloric acid, the latter producing, with the monamine
liberated in the reaction, a salt which in its turn is likewise decom

   Thus    the  chloride   of   diethylammonium,        for instance,    together with
chloride    of  ether   and     ethylamine, yields ethylene          and   chloride of
ethylammonium        which      splits into   chloride   of ether    and   ammonia.
   The idea naturally suggested itself, to attempt, by means of this

     In  a note addressed to the Royal Society* at the commencement
of   this year,    I
                  have shown that the molecules of the diamines, like
those  of all other well-examined compounds, correspond to two
volumes of vapour'f, and I have endeavoured to explain the apparent
anomalous vapour-densities of the hydrated diamines by assuming
that the vapour-volume eXperimentully obtained was a mixture of
the vapour of the anhydrous base and of the vapour of water.
Thus, hydrated ethylene-diamine was assumed to split under the
in<U+FB02>uence of heat into anhydrous ethylene-diamine (2 vols. of vapour)
and water (2 vols. of vapour).

   The vapour-density of the anhydrous base was found by experi
ment to be 57'6l, showing that the molecule of diethyl-ethylcne
diamine corresponds to 2 vols. of vapour, the theoretical density
   On submitting the crystalline hydrate to experiment,    I arrived at
the vapour-density 33-2. This number is in perfect accordance with
the result obtained in the case of ethylene-diamine.   The legitimate
interpretation of this number is that here again the hydrated base
splits into the anhydrous diamine and water, and that the density
observed is that of a mixture of equal volumes of diamine-vapour
and of water-vapour, the theoretical density of which is  57+o_   _33.
                                                             2
The correctness of this interpretation admits of   an elegant    experi
mental demonstration.
   Having observed that the hydrate loses its water when repeatedly
distilled with a large excess of anhydrous baryta, the idea suggested
itself, to attempt the decomposition of the hydrate in the state of
vapour.    If the vapour obtained by heating this hydrate to a tem
perature 15° or 20° higher than its boiling-point actually consisted
of a mixture of equal volumes of its two proximate constituents in a
state of dissociation (to use a happy term proposed by Deville), it
appeared very probable that the volume would be halved b the
introduction of anhydrous baryta.       Experiment has veri<U+FB01>e       this
anticipation.
   The upper half of a glass tube
<U+FB01>lled with, and inverted over, mer
cury, was surrounded by a second
glass tube open at both ends and of
a diameter about treble that of the
former, the annular space between
the two being closed at the bottom
of the outer tube by a well-<U+FB01>tting
cork. The vessel thus formed round
the upper part of the inner tube
was moreover provided with a small
bent copper tube open at the top
and closed at the bottom, which
was likewise <U+FB01>xed in the cork. The
vessel being <U+FB01>lled with paraf<U+FB01>n and
a lamp being applied to the copper
tube, the upper part of the mer
cury-tube could be conveniently
kept at a high and constant temperature, whilst the lower end,
immersed in the mercury-trough, remained accessible.       A glance at
the <U+FB01>gure explains the disposition of the apparatus.    A small quan
tity of the hydrated base was then allowed to rise on the top of the
mercury in the tube; and the paraf<U+FB01>n hath having been heated to
 l70°, the volume of the vapour was observed.        Several pellets of

160                            Royal Society :—
anhydrous baryta were then allowed to ascend into the vapour
volume, while the temperature was maintained constant.           The mer
cury began immediately to rise, becoming stationary again, when a
fraction of the vapour had disappeared, which amounted, the neces
sary corrections being made, to half the original volume.

  hamidobenzamine, a new base ; and some Remarks upon Ureas and
so-called Ureas.       By A. W. Hofmann, LL.D., F.R.S. Received
July   24, 1860.
    Among the numerous compounds capable of the metamorphosis
involved in Zinin’s beautiful reaction, the nitriles have hitherto
escaped the attention of chemists.         This is the more remarkable,
since some of these bodies are easily converted into crystalline
nitro-compounds.
    When examining several of the diamines which             I have lately
submitted to the Royal Society *, I was induced to study the trans
formation which benzonitrile undergoes under the successive in<U+FB02>u~
ence of nitric acid and reducing agents.
    Benzonitrile, when treated with a mixture of sulphuric and fuming
nitric acid, furnishes, as is well known, a solid nitro-substitute which
crystallizes from alcohol in beautiful white needles, containing
                      0, H, N, o,=c,    (11,,  N0,) N1:
    In order to obtain this body, it is desirable to perform the opera
tion with small quantities, and to cool the liquid carefully, otherwise
 the formation of appreciable proportions of nitrobenzoic acid can
 scarcely be avoided.
    The nitro-compound is readily attacked by an aqueous solution of
 sulphide of ammonium ; sulphur is abundantly precipitated, and on
 evaporating the liquid, a yellowish red oil is separated, which
 gradually and imperfectly solidi<U+FB01>es.       This substance possesses the
 characters of a weak base, dissolving with facility in acids, and being
 again precipitated by the addition of ammonia and the alkalies. The
 preparation in the state of purity, both of the base itself and of its
 compounds, presents some dif<U+FB01>culty.            This circumstance has pre
 vented me from analysing the base.        I  have, however, examined one
 of its products of decomposition, which leaves no doubt that nitro
 benzonitrile, under the in<U+FB02>uence of reducing agents, undergoes the
 well-known transformation of nitro-compounds, and that the com
 position of the oily base is represented by the formula
                          C7 Ha N2=C7   H, (N11,) N.
    The oily base, when left in contact with sulphide of ammonium,
 is gradually changed, a crystalline compound being formed, which is
 easily soluble in alcohol and in ether, but di<U+FB01>icultly soluble in water,
 and which may be puri<U+FB01>ed by several crystallizations from boiling

      1. "Description of two Bone-caves in the Mountain of Ker, at
 Massat, in the Department of the Arriege." By M. Alfred Fontan.
 Communicated by M. E. Lartet, For. Mem. G.S.
     The valley of Massat, on the northern side of the Pyrenees, is of a
 triangular shape, its northern angle being narrowed by the projecting
 limestone mountain of Ker.         Among the <U+FB01>ssures and grottos that
 traverse this mountain in every direction are twa caves in particular:
 one is situated near the top, at about 100 metres above the valley;
 the other is near the base, at about ‘20 metres above the river. They
 both open towards the north.          In the upper cave M. Fontan found
 a sandy loam with pebbles (the pebbles being of rocks di<U+FB02>'erent from
 that of the mountain), extending inwards for 100 metres, and con
 taining a large quantity of bones of Carnivore. Ruminantia, and
Rodentia,—those of the great Cave-bear, a large Hyena, and a large
Felis being the most numerous.           On the surface some fragments of
pottery, an iron poignard, and two Roman coins were found, with a
quantity of cinders and charcoal; and at a depth of more than 3
feet in the ossiferons loam another bed of cinders and charcoal was
met with, and in this M. Fontan found a bone arrow-head and two
human teeth; the latter were at a distance of5 or 6 metres one
from the other.
    In the lower cavern a blackish earth, with large granitic and other
pebbles, was found to contain bones of the Red Deer, Antelope.

    Aurochs, and Lynx; also worked <U+FB02>ints and numerous utensils of
   bone (of deer chie<U+FB02>y), such as bodkins and arrows; the latter have
   grooves on their barbs, probably for poison.         Some of the bones
   bear marks made of incisions by sharp instruments in <U+FB02>aying or cut
    ting np the carcases.     In each cavern a chasm crosses the gallery
    and terminates the deposits—in the upper cave at 100 metres, in the
    lower one at about 7 metres from the entrance.
       The author argues that, from the facts which he has noticed, these
    caverns must have been subjected simultaneously to the effects of a
   great transient diluvial cataclysm coming from the N.N.W. or West,
   in the opposite direction to the present course of the waters of that
   region; that man and all the other animals the remains of which
    are buried in these caves existed in the valley before this inundation ;
   and that the greater part of the animals inhabited the caves, but
   that man was not contemporary with all of them.
       2. “ Notes   on some further Discoveries of Flint Implements in the
   Drift;   with  a few suggestions for search elsewhere."     By  J. Prest
   wich, Esq., F.R.S., Treas.G.S.
       Since the author's communication to the Royal Society last year
   on the discovery of Flint Implements in Pleistocene beds at Abbe
   ville, Amiens, and Hoxne, similar implements have been found in
   some new localities in this country.
       In Suffolk, between Icklingham and Mildenhall, Mr. Warren has
   met with some specimens in the gravel of ltampart Hill in the valley
   of the Lark. This gravel is of later date than the Boulder-clay of
   the neighbourhood.      In Kent, Mr. Leech, Mr. Evans, and the author
   found some specimens at the foot of the cliffs between Herne Bay
  and the Reculvers.       The author believes them to have been derived
  from a freshwater deposit that caps the cli<U+FB02>“, and which has been
  found by Mr. Evans and himself to yield similar specimens at Swale
  Cli<U+FB02>' near Whitstable.      In Bedfordshire, Mr. J. Wyatt, F.G.S., has
  found some specimens in the gravel at Biddenham, near Bedford ;
  this gravel also is of freshwater origin, and is younger than the
  Boulder-clay.       In Surrey, a specimen found in the gravel of Pease
  marsh twenty-<U+FB01>ve years ago has been brought forward by its dis~
  coverer, Mr. Whitburn of Guildford. In Herts, Mr. Evans has found
  a specimen in the surface-drift on the Chalk Hills nearAbbotsLangley.
  Lastly, the author recommended that diligent search be made in the
  gravel and brick-earth at Copford and Lexden near Colchester, at
  Grays and Ilford in Essex, at Erith, Brentford, Taplow, Hurley,
  Reading, Oxford, Cambridge, Chippenham, Bath, Blandford, Salis
  bury, Chichester, Selsea, Peasemarsh, Godalming, Croydon, Hert
  ford, Stamford, Orton near Peterbcrough, &c.

         GENTLEMBN,                                     Parsonstown,    July   1861.
     SAW last week in     some newspaper a notice that in America mi
     crometers have lately been made by means of photography. Ido
not know from what publication this notice has been taken; but as I
have been for the last month or so engaged occasionally in making
experiments with the same intention as an original idea, I send
you a short account of what I have done, for publication if you think
it suf<U+FB01>ciently interesting.
   My endeavour was to get a. glass slide for a microscope marked so
as to measure very minute objects; and as the micrometer I have
 (measuring Tllwth of an inch) was useless tor the purpose I had in
view, it occurred to me that by the diminishing power of the camera
I might succeed in obtaining smaller divisions. I tried <U+FB01>rst for pic
tures of dark lines, Tlgth of an inch in breadth, on a white ground,
reduced to a small compass, but I did not succeed even with a very
small aperture to the lens. I then substituted lines ith of an inch in
breadth removed to a greater distance, andl got a pretty sharp pic
ture; but I found that the sharpest and best-marked picture of distant
lines I obtained was given by opake bars, placed so that the light
from a clear sky came to the camera between them.
   By nailing rods of blackened wood, ith of an inch broad and 2th of
an inch asunder, across a frame, and placing this at a suitable distance
with a clear light behind, and using an aperture of about 3L0] of an
inch in diameter, I easily obtained well-marked and sharp lines the
W‘<U+FB01>th of an inch apart and the 1 l,th of an inch in breadth, suf<U+FB01>
                                         010
ciently accurate for all the purposes of    micrometer.
                                               a            The picture
of the lines requires to be covered with transparent varnish to pre
vent rubbing.     I have taken the picture on very thin talc, and ce
mented      to glass with the collodion between the plates; and for
           it
object-glasses of small power Ihave found      answer; but the thick
                                                   it
ness of the talc     istoo much for the higher powers, as the object
viewed and the lines do not suf<U+FB01>ciently agree in focus.
 I   suppose the reason why lines with spaces between them give                   a
better picture than black lines ruled on      white ground
                                               a                becauseis

there is no irradiation of light from behind, at least not nearly so much
from the spaces as from the white ground.          At all events, whatever
the cause may be, I have found the lines with the spaces give a much
better and sharper impression.
   The picture of the lines should be a positive one, and very clear.
I found the collodion prepared with the iodide of iron, according to
the formula given in this Magazine, July 1854, to act admirably.            It
must be very sensitive, on account of the smallness of the aperture
necessary for the required sharpness.
    I have no doubt that much <U+FB01>ner lines than these I have got might
be obtained by the same process.

         ON THE BOILING OF LIQUIDS.             BY M. L. DUFOUR.
   The ebullition of liquids, instead of taking place under normal
circumstances of temperature and pressure, varies, as is well known,
with the vessel in which the liquid is contained. In an earthen
vessel, for instance, the ebullition is at a higher point than in one of
metal; and Marcet has shown that the treatment the glass has
experienced, washing with sulphuric acid, &c., often modi<U+FB01>es the
boiling-point to the extent of several degrees.          Water deprived of
air and placed in the conditions of a water-hammer, may be heated
several degrees above 1000 C. without passing into the gaseous state,
but it then boils violently.        Donny has shown that water free from
air and carefully heated, may be raised to 135° without assuming
the gaseous state.      This retardation of ebullition is further found in
other liquids; and the violent production of vapour is a frequent in
dication of it in glass vessels.
   The ebullition not being produced except at a temperature higher
than that at which the elastic force of the vapour is equal to the ex
ternal pressure, is due to two causes,—<U+FB01>rst, the adhesion of the liquid
to the substance of the vessel; and secondly, the absence of air in
solution.
   There are nevertheless some curious cases in which the retardation
of boiling cannot be explained by the adhesion to a solid, and the
absence of air, yet where the contact of a solid produces a sudden
formation of vapour.        If linseed oil be heated in a dish to 105° or
 HO" and a few drops of water be allowed to fall, they will sink to
the bottom of the vessel.       The moment they touch there is a. sudden
formation of vapour; the globule of water, slightly diminished, is
repelled a few millimetres from the bottom; it again sinks, giving
rise to a fresh disengagement of vapour, which raises it again, and
so on.     There is no perceptible evaporation from the globules of
water so long as they <U+FB02>oat on the oil, and are not in contact with
the side of the vessel; and it is only on the sudden contact of the
solid that a bubble of vapour is suddenly produced.           It is natural to
inquire   what  would    take   place if the water during  its  being heated

was kept from the side of the vessel, and <U+FB02>oated in a medium of the
same density as its own.       The medium to be employed ought to
exceed 100° without boiling, have the same density as water, and
not form aqueous mixtures.      Oils are unsuitable, but certain essences
realize these conditions.
    Essence of cloves, to which a small quantity of oil has been added,
forms a liquid in which water remains in equilibrium in round
spheres, and perfectly movcable in the interior.      1f heated carefully,
a temperature far above 100° may frequently be attained before the
ebullition of the water ensues.      A temperature of 120° and 130° is
frequently reached; and I have often had these aqueous spheres 10
 millims. in diameter at 140° to 150°.     Smaller spheres, l to 2 mil
 lims. in diameter, have often been raised to 170°, and even 175°;
 that is, to temperatures at which the tension of aqueous vapour is
 8 atmospheres.       The water had undergone no preparation; it was
 neither distilled nor free from air. At these high temperatures there
 is not, as might be thought, a slow and continuous ebullition.       The
 spheres are as limpid and calm at 150° as at 10°.
    Ebullition ensues when the globules come in contact with a solid.
 If, carried by the currents which are produced during the heating.
 they strike against the side of the vessel or the bulb of the thermo
 meter, there is a sudden production of vapour. The globule, which
 has become somewhat smaller, is driven to some distance from the
 point at which the explosion is produced, but it continues to <U+FB02>oat.
 1f, when the temperature exceeds 115° to 120°, the aqueous globnle
 is touched with a glass or metal rod, a similar effect is produced; an
 eXplosion takes place at the point of contact, a bubble of vapour is
 disengaged which traverses the essence. and the globule is driven
 away as if the point had exerted on it a sudden repulsion. The solids
 best <U+FB01>tted for producing this effect are a pointed piece of wood or of
 charcoal.    Glass or metal rods occasionally fail; the contact of
 saline crystals is generally successful.               ‘
    The preceding phenomena may also be produced with other liquids
 when heated under suitable conditions.        Chloroform, for example.
 heated in a solution of chloride of zinc, may be raised to 900 or 100°.
    It is natural to connect these phenomena with those in which the
 contact of a solid induces the crystallization of supersaturated saline
 solutions, as well as with the sudden solidi<U+FB01>cation of water, sulphur,
 &c., reduced below the ordinary temperature of solidi<U+FB01>cation.       They
 are also intimately connected with the phenomenon of liquids re~
 sisting solidi<U+FB01>cation when they are immersed in a <U+FB02>uid medium.          It
 appears as if the contact of solids were a determining cause for the
 change of condition in liquids; and it may be that the limits of tem
  perature which we have assigned to the different conditions of bodies
 are less absolute than they appear.-Camptes Rendus, May 13, 1861.

 § 1.             researches on glaciers which    I have had the honour
         THE   of submitting from time to time to the notice of the
 Royal Society, directed my attention in a special manner to the
observations and speculations of De Saussure, Fourier, M. Pouil
let, and Mr. Hopkins, on the transmission of solar and terrestrial
heat through the earth’s atmosphere.          This gave practical effect
to a desire which I had previously entertained to make the
mutual action of radiant heat and gases of all kinds the subject
of an experimental inquiry.
    Our acquaintance with this department of Physics is exceed
ingly limited.      So far as my knowledge extends, the literature
of the subject may be stated in a few words.                     .
    From experiments with his admirable thermo-elcctric appa
ratus, Melloni inferred that for a distance of 18 or 20 feet the
absorption of radiant heat by atmospheric air is perfectly insen
sible'i'.
    With a delicate apparatus of the same kind, Dr. Franz of
Berlin found that the air contained in a tube 3 feet long ab
sorbed 3'54 per cent. of the heat sent through it from an Ar
gand lamp; that is to say, calling the number of rays which
passed through the exhausted tube 100, the number which
passed when the tube was <U+FB01>lled with air was only 96461.

      In    the sequel   I shall refer to circumstances which induce me
to conclude that the result obtained by Dr. Franz is due to an
inadvertence in his mode of observation.                  These are the only
experiments of this nature with which                 I  am acquainted,    and
they       leave the   <U+FB01>eld  of inquiry  now   before   us perfectly  unbroken
ground.
      § 2. At an early stage of the investigation,          I  experienced the
 need of a <U+FB01>rst-class galvanometer.               My instrument was con
 structed by that cxccllent workman, Sauerwald of Berlin.                  The
 needles are suspended independently of the shade; the latter is
 constructed so as to enclose the smallest possible amount of air,
 the disturbance           of aerial currents being thereby practically
 avoided.        The plane glass plate, which forms the cover of the
 instrument, is close to the needle; so that the position of the
 latter can be read off with ease and accuracy either by the naked
 eye or by a magnifying lens.
       The wire of the coil belonging to this instrument was drawn
 from copper obtained from a galvano-plastic               manufactory in the
 Prussian Capital; but it was not free from the magnetic metals.
       In consequence of its impurity in this respect, when the
 needles were perfectly astatic they deviated as much as 30° right
 and left of the neutral line. To neutralize this, a “ compensator
                                                                               ”
  was made use of, by which the needle was gently drawn to zero
  in opposition to the magnetism of the coil.
       But the instrument suffered much in point of delicacy from
  this arrangement, and accurate quantitative determinations with
  it were unattainable.           I therefore sought to replace the Berlin
  coil by a less magnetic one. Mr. Becker <U+FB01>rst supplied me with
  a coil which reduced the lateral de<U+FB02>ection from 30° to 3°.
       But even this small residue was a source of great annoyance
  to me ; and for a time          I almost despaired of obtaining pure cop
   per wire.       I  knew that Professor Magnu had succeeded in ob
   taining it for his galvanometer, but the labour of doing so was
   immense *.         Previous to undertaking a similar task, the thought
   occurred to me, that for my purpose a magnet furnished an
  immediate and perfect test as to the quality of the wire.                Pure
   copper is diamagnetic; hence its repulsion or attraction by the
   magnet would at once declare its <U+FB01>tness or un<U+FB01>tness for the pur
   pose which       I  had in View.
        Fragments of the wire <U+FB01>rst furnished to me by M. Sauerwald
    were strongly attracted by the magnet.               The wire furnished by
    Mr. Becker, when covered with its green silk, was also at
   tracted, though in a much feebler degree.
         I  then removed the green silk covering from the latter and
    tested the naked wire.          It was repelled. The whole annoyance

was thus fastened on the green silk; some iron compound had
been used in the dyeing of it; and to this the deviation of my
needle from zero was manifestly due.
  I   had the green coating removed and the wire overspun with
white silk, clean hands being used in the process.            A perfect
galvanometer    is the result.   The  needle, when  released   from the
action of a current, returns accurately to zero, and is perfectly
free from all magnetic action on the part of the coil.           In fact
while we have been devising agate plates and other elaborate
methods to get rid of the great nuisance of a magnetic coil*, the
means of doing so are at hand.           Nothing is more easy to be
found than diamagnctic copper wire.         Out of eleven specimens,
four of which were furnished by Mr. Becker, and seven taken at
random from our laboratory, nine were found diamagnetic and
only two magnetic.
    Perhaps the only defect of those <U+FB01>ne instruments with which
Du Bois'Raymond conducts his admirable researches in animal
electricity is that above alluded to. The needle never comes to
zero, but is drawn to it by a minute magnet.         This defect may
be completely removed.         By the substitution of clean white silk
for green, however large the coil may be, the compensator may
be dispensed with, and a great augmentation of delicacy secured.
The instrument will be rendered suitable for quantitative mea
surements; effects which are now beyond the reach of experi
ment will be rendered manifest; while the important results
 hitherto established will be obtained with a fraction of the length
of wire now in use'l'.                         _
    §  3. Our  present  knowledge    of the deportment   of liquids and
 solids, would lead to the inference that, if gases and vapours
 exercised any appreciable absorptive power on radiant heat, the
 absorption would make itself most manifest on heat emanating
 from an obscure source.       But an experimental dif<U+FB01>culty occurs
 at the outset in dealing with such heat.         How must we close
 the receiver containing the gases through which the calori<U+FB01>c
 rays are to be sent? Melloni found that a glass plate one-tenth
 of an inch in thickness intercepted all the rays emanating from
 a source of the temperature of boiling water, and fully 94, per
cent. of the rays from a source of 400° Centigrade.    Hence a tube
closed with glass plates would be scarcely     more  suitable for the
purpose now under consideration, than         its ends were stopped
                                              _if
by plates of metal.

  1'  Mr. Becker, to whose skill and intelligence   I have been   greatly in
debted, furnished me with several specimens of wire of the same   <U+FB01>neness as
that used by Du Bois Raymond, some covered with green silk        and others
with white.    The former were invariably attracted. the latter    invariably
repelled.  In  all cases the naked wire was repelled.

172               Prof. Tyndall     on the  Absorption and
   Rock-salt immediately suggests itself as the proper substance;
but to obtain' plates of suitable size and transparency was ex
ceedingly dif<U+FB01>cult.       Indeed, had I been less e<U+FB02>iciently seconded,
the obstacles thus arising might have been insuperable.                To the
Trustees of the British Museum I am indebted for the material
of one good plate of salt; to Mr. Harlin for another; while Mr.
Lettsom, at the instance of Mr. Darker*, brought me a piece of
salt from Germany from which two fair plates were taken.                   To
Lady Murchison, Sir Emerson Tennant, Sir Philip Egerton, and
Mr. Pattison my best thanks are also due for their friendly
assistance.
    The <U+FB01>rst experiments were made with a tube of tin polished
inside, 4 feet long and 2'4 inches in diameter, the ends of which
were furnished with brass appendages to receive the plates of
rock-salt.      Each plate was pressed <U+FB01>rmly against a <U+FB02>ange by
means of a bayonet joint, being separated from the <U+FB02>ange by a
suitable washer.         Various descriptions of leather washers were
tried for this purp0se and rejected.                The substance <U+FB01>nally
chosen was vulcanized india-rubber very lightly smeared with a
mixture of bees-wax and spermaceti.                A T-piece was attached
to the tube, communicating on one side with a good air-pump,
and on the other with the external air, or with a vessel contain
ing the proper gas.
    The tube being mounted horizontally, a Leslie’s cube contain
ing hot water was placed close to one of its ends, while an excel
lent thermo-eleetric pile, connected with its galvanometer, was
presented to the other.          The tube being exhausted, the calori<U+FB01>c
rays sent through it fell upon the pile, a permanent de<U+FB02>ection of
30° being the consequence.             The temperature of the water was
in the <U+FB01>rst instance purposely so arranged as to produce this
de<U+FB02>ection.
    Dry air was new admitted into the tube, while the needle of
the galvanometer was obserVed with all possible care.                Even by
the aid of a magnifying lens            I  could not detect the slightest
change of position.        Oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, subjected
to the same test, gave the same negative result.              The tempera
ture of the water was subsequently lowered so as to produce a
de<U+FB02>ection of 20° and 10° in succession, and then heightened till
the de<U+FB02>ection amounted to 40°, 50°, 60° and 70° ; but in no
case did the admission of air, or any of the above gases into the
exhausted tube, produce any sensible change in the position of
the needle.
    It is a well-known peculiarity of the galvauometer, that its
higher and lower degrees represent different amounts of calori<U+FB01>c

action.          In
                my instrument, for example, the quantity of heat
 necessary to move the needle from 60° to 61° is about twenty
 times that required to move it from 11° to 12°.               Now in the
 case of the small de<U+FB02>ections above referred to, the needle was, it
 is true, in a sensitive position; but then the total amount of
 heat passing through the tube was so inconsiderable that a small
 per-centage of         it,
                       even     absorbed, might well escape detection.
                                    if
 In the case of the large de<U+FB02>ections, on the other hand, though
 the total amount of heat was large, and though the quantity
 absorbed might be proportionate, the needle was in such             posi a
 tion as to require       very considerable abstraction of heat to pro
                                a
 duce any sensible change in its position.              Hence arose the
 thought   of  operating,           if
                                possible,  with large quantities of heat,
 while the needle intended to reveal its absorption should con
 tinue to occupy its position of maximum delicacy.
    The first attempt at solving this problem was as follows :—My
 galvanometer           differential one—the coil being composed of
                       is   a
 two wires wound side                   by
                                  side, so that    current could be sent
                                                      a
 through either of them independent of the other.            The thermo
electric pile was placed at one end of the tin tube, and the ends
 of one of the galvanometer wires connected with it.                  A
                                                                   copper
 ball heated to low redness being placed at the other end of the
tube, the needle of the galvanometer was propelled to its stops
 near 90°.     The ends of the second wire were now so attached
to  a second pile that when the latter was caused to approach the
copper ball, the current thus excited passed through the coil in
a  direction opp0sed to the <U+FB01>rst one. Gradually, as the second
pile was brought nearer to the source of heat, the needle de
scended from the stops, and when the two currents were nearly
equal the position of the needle was close to zero.
    Here then we had          powerful <U+FB02>ux of heat through the tube;
                                    a
and     if  column of gas four feet long exercised any sensible
             a
absorption, the needle was in the position best calculated to
reveal it.    In the <U+FB01>rst experiment made in this way, the neutral
ization of one current                  by
                                the other occurred when the tube was
<U+FB01>lled with air; and after the exhaustion of the tube had com
menced, the needle started suddenly off in               direction which
                                                            a
indicated   that    less
                       a  amount     of heat passed through the partially
exhausted tube, than through the tube <U+FB01>lled with air.                 The
needle, however, soon stopped, turned, descended quickly to zero,
and passed on to the other side, where its de<U+FB02>ection became per
manent.      The air made use of in this experiment came direct
from the laboratory, and the first impulsion of the needle was
probably 'due to the aqueous vapour precipitated as                 cloud
                                                                      a
by  the sudden exhaustion of the tube.             When, previous to its
admission, the air was passed over chloride of calcium, or

174              Prof. Tyndall  on the Absorption and
pumice-stone moistened with sulphuric acid, no such effect was
observed.     The needle moved steadily in one direction until its
maximum de<U+FB02>ection was attained, and this de<U+FB02>ection showed that
in all cases radiant heat was absorbed by the air within the tube.
    These experiments were commenced in the spring of 1859,
and continued without intermission for seven weeks.       The course
of the inquiry during this whole period was an incessant struggle
with experimental di<U+FB02>iculties. Approximate results were easily
                    I
obtainable; but aimed at exact measurements, which could not
be made with a varying source of heat like the copper ball.            I
resorted to copper cubes containing fusible metal, or oil, raised
to a high temperature; but was not satis<U+FB01>ed with their action.         I
<U+FB01>nally had a lamp constructed which poured a sheet of gas-<U+FB02>ame
 along a plate of copper ; and to keep the <U+FB02>ame constant, a gas
 regulator specially constructed for me by Mr. Hulet was made
 use of.    It was also arranged that the radiating plate should
 form one of the walls of a chamber which could be connected
 with the air-pump and exhausted, so that the heat emitted by
 the copper plate might cross a vacuum before entering the expe
 rimental tube. With this apparatus 1 determined approximately
 the absorption of nine gases and twenty vapours during the
 summer of 1859.         The results would furnish materials for a
 long memoir; but increased experience and improved methods
 have enabled me to substitute for them others of greater value;
 I shall therefore pass over the work of these seven weeks with
 out further allusion to it.
     On the 9th of September of the present year (1860)     I  resumed
 the inquiry.                       I
                  For three weeks worked with the platc‘of copper
 as my source of heat, but <U+FB01>nally rejected it on the score of in
  suf<U+FB01>cient constancy.      Iagain resorted to the cube of hot oil,
  and continued to work with it up to Monday the 29th of
  October.    During the seven weeks just referred to,        I  experi
  mented from eight to ten hours daily; but these experiments,
  though more accurate, must unhappily share the fate of the
  former ones.      In fact the period was one of discipline—a con
  tinued struggle against the dif<U+FB01>culties of the subject and the
  defects of the locality in which the inquiry was conducted.
     My reason for making use of the high sources of heat above
  referred to was, that the absorptive power of some of the gases
  which   I had examined was so small that, to make it clearly
  evident,  a  high temperature was essential.       For other gases,
  and for all the vapours that had come under my notice, a source
  of lower temperature would have been not only suf<U+FB01>cient, but
  far preferable.    I 'was <U+FB01>nally induced to resort to boiling water,
  which, though it gave greatly diminished effects, was capable of
  being preserved at so constant a temperature that de<U+FB02>ections

    which, with the other sources, would be masked by the errors of
    observation,   became with it true quantitative measures of absorp
    tion.

    composed of brass, polished within, and connected, as shown in
    the <U+FB01>gure, with the air-pump, AA.          At S and S' are the plates
    of rock-salt which close the tube air-tight.        The length from S
    to S' is 4 feet.    C is a cube containing boiling water, in which
    is immersed the thermometer t.           The cube is of cast copper,
    and on one of its faces a projecting ring was cast to which a
'
    brass tube of the same diameter as 88/, and capable of being
    connected air-tight with the latter, was carefully soldered.        The
    face of the cube within the ring, is the radiating        late, which is
    coated with lampblack.        Thus between the cube        and the <U+FB01>rst   (2,

     to the bottom of the vessel; the water escapes through the ef<U+FB02>ux

 176             Prof. Tyndall  on the Absorption      and
 the contrary, as in the case of atmospheric air, both moisture            '
 and carbonic acid were to be removed, the potash tube was in
 cluded.    G G is a holder from which the gas to be experimented
 with was sent through the drying-tubes, and thence through
 the pipe 11 p into the experimental tube S S'.         The appendage at
 M and the arrangement atOO may         for the  present be disregarded;
 I shall refer to them particularly by and by.
    The mode of proceeding was as followsz—The tube S S' and
 the chamber F being exhausted as perfectly as possible, the con
nexion between them was intercepted by shutting o<U+FB02>" the cocks
m, m'.    The rays from the interior blackened surface of the ‘cube
 C passed <U+FB01>rst across the vacuum F, then through the plate of
 rock-salt S, traversed the experimental tube, crossed the second
plate 8', and being concentrated by the anterior conical re<U+FB02>ector,
 impinged upon the adjacent face of the pile P.                Meanwhile
the rays from the hot cube C' fell upon the opposite face of the
 pile, and the position of the galvanometer needle declared at
once which source was predominant.           A movement of the screen
 H back or forward with the hand su<U+FB02>iced to establish an approxi
mate equality; but to make the radiations perfectly equal, and
thus bring the needle exactly to 0°, the <U+FB01>ne motion of the screw
above referred to was necessary.         The needle being at 0°, the
gas to be examined was admitted into the tube; passing, in the
<U+FB01>rst place, through the drying apparatus.           Any required quan
tity of the gas may be admitted; and here experiments on gases
and vapours enjoy an advantage over those with liquids and
solids, namely, the capability of changing the density at plea
sure.    When the required quantity of gas had been admitted,
the galvanometer was observed, and from the de<U+FB02>ection of its
needle the absorption was accurately determined.
    Up to about its 36th degree, the degrees of my galvanometer
are all equal in value; that is to sa , it requires the same amount
of heat to move the needle from 1 to 2° as to move it from 35°
to 36°.    Beyond this limit the degrees are equivalent to larger
amounts of heat.      The instrument was accurately calibrated by
the method recommended by Melloni (Thermochrose, p. 59) ; so
that the precise value of its larger de<U+FB02>ections are at once obtained
by reference to a table.     Up to the 36th degree, therefore, the
simple de<U+FB02>ections may be regarded as the expreSsion of the ab
sorption ; but beyond this the absorption equivalent to any de<U+FB02>ec
tion is obtained from the table of calibration.
    § 5. The air of the laboratory, freed from its moisture and
carbonic acid, and permitted to enter until the tube was <U+FB01>lled,
produced a de<U+FB02>ection of about                .    .  .   .  .   .   .  1°.
    Oxygen    obtained   from  chlorate   of   potash   and   peroxide  of
manganese produced      a  de<U+FB02>ection of  about    .  .   .  .   .   .  1°.

                Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours.                                177
    One specimen of nitrogen, obtained from the decomposition
of nitrate of potash, produced a de<U+FB02>ection of about . . .                               1°.
    Hydrogen from zinc and sulphuric acid produced a de<U+FB02>ection
of about      .   .  .   .   .   .     .    .    .   .    .    .    .     .    .    .   1°.
    Hydrogen obtained from the electrolysis of water produced a
de<U+FB02>ection of about .         .   .                                                      1°
    Oxygen obtained        from    the     electrolysis       of   water, and sent
through a series of eight bulbs containing a strong solution of
iodide of potassium, produced a de<U+FB02>ection of about                             .    .   1°.
    In the last experiment the electrolytic oxygen was freed from
its ozone. The iodide of potassium was afterwards suppressed,
and the oxygen, plus its ozone, admitted into the tube; the de
<U+FB02>ection produced was                  .    .    .    .    .    .    .   .     .    .   4°.
    Hence the small quantity of ozone which accompanied the
oxygen in this case trebled the absorption of the oxygen itself*.
    I have repeated this experiment many times, employing
different sources of heat.           With sources of high temperature
the difference between the ozone and the ordinary oxygen comes
out very strikingly.        By careful decomposition a much larger
amount of ozone might be obtained, and a corresponding large
effect on radiant heat produced.
                                                       I
    In obtaining the electrolytic oxygen, made use. of two differ
eut vessels.     To diminish the resistance of the acidulated water
to the passage of the current, I placed in one vessel a pair of
very large platinum plates, between which the current from a
battery of ten of Grovc’s cells was transmitted.                          The oxygen
bubbles liberated on so large a surface were extremely minute,
and the gas thus generated, on being sent through iodide of po
tassium, scarcely coloured the liquid; the characteristic odour
of ozone was also almost entirely absent.                   In the second vessel
smaller plates were used.          The bubbles of oxygen were much
larger, and did not come into such intimate contact with either
the platinum or the water.           The oxygen thus obtained showed
the characteristic reactions of ozone ; and with it the above result
was obtained.
    The total amount of heat transmitted through the tube in
these experiments produced a de<U+FB02>ection of                               .          71°‘5.
    Taking as unit of heat the quantity necessary to cause the
needle to move from 0° to 1°, the number of units expressed by
the above de<U+FB02>ection is         .   .     .    .    .    .   .    .    .     .    .    308.
    Hence the absorption by the above gases amounted to about
0'33 per cent.
    I am unable at the present moment to range with certainty
oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and atmospheric air in the order of
   " It will be seen further on that this result is in harmony with the sup
position that ozone, obtained in the manner described, is a compound body.

178            Prof. Tyndall   on the Absorption   and
their absorptive powers, though I have made several hundred
experiments with the view of doing so.       Their proper action is
so small that the slightest foreign impurity gives one a predomi
nance over the other.       In preparing the gases, I have resorted
to the methods which I found recommended in chemical trea
tises, but as yet only to discover the defects incidental to
these methods.       Augmented experience and the assistance of
my   friends will, I trust, enable me to solve this point by and by.
An examination of the whole of the experiments induces me to
regard hydrogen as the gas which exercises the lowest absorp
tive power.
     We have here the cases of minimum gaseous absorption.            It
will be interesting to place in juxtaposition with the  above   results
some of those obtained with ole<U+FB01>ant gas—the most highly ab
sorbent permanent gas that     I  have hitherto examined.      I select
 for this purpose an experiment made on the 21st of November.
     The needle being steady at zero in consequence of the equa
 lity of the actions on the opposite faces of the pile, the admis
 sion of ole<U+FB01>ant gas gave a permanent de<U+FB02>ection of .         .   70°'3.
     The gas being completely removed, and the equilibrium re
 established, a plate of polished metal was interposed between
 one of the faces of the pile and the source of heat adjacent.
 The total amount of heat passing through the exhausted tube
 was thus found to produce a de<U+FB02>ection of       .   .  .   .   .   75°.
      Now a de<U+FB02>ection of 70°‘3 is equivalent to 290 units, and a
  de<U+FB02>ection of 75° is equivalent to 360 units; hence more than
  seven-ninths of the total heat was cut off by the ole<U+FB01>ant gas, or
 about 81 per cent.
      The extraordinary energy with which the needle was de<U+FB02>ected
  when the ole<U+FB01>ant gas was admitted into the tube, was such as
  might occur had the plates of rock-salt become suddenly covered
  with an opake layer.     To test whether any such action occurred,
 I   polished a plate carefully, and projected against it for a con
  siderable time a stream of the gas; there was no dimness pro
  duced.     The plates of rock-salt, moreover, which were removed
  daily from the tube, usually appeared as bright when taken out
  as when they were put in.
      The gas in these experiments issued from its holder, and had
   there been in contact with cold water.     To test whether it had
   chilled the plates of rock-salt, and thus produced the effect, I
   <U+FB01>lled a similar holder with atmospheric air and allowed it to
   attain the temperature of the water; but its action was not
 thereby sensibly augmented.
    In order to subject the gas to ocular examination,   had a I
 glass tube constructed and connected with the air-pump.    On
 permitting ole<U+FB02>ant gas to enter     it,
                                   not the slightest dimness or

               Radiation of Heat by Gases and      Vapour-s.          179
opacity was observed.         To remove the last trace of doubt as to
the possible action of the gas on the plates of rock-salt, the tin
tube referred to at the commencement was perforated at its
centre and a cock inserted into it; the source of heat was at
one end of the tube, and the thermo-electric pile at some distance
from the other.       The plates of salt were entirely abandoned, the
tube being open at its ends and consequently full of air.              On
allowing the ole<U+FB01>ant gas to stream for a second or two into the
tube through the central cock, the needle <U+FB02>ew off and struck
against its stops.       It was held steadily for a considerable time
between 80° and 90°.
    A slow current of air sent through the tube gradually removed
the gas, and the needle returned accurately to zero.
    The gas within the holder being under a pressure of about 12
inches of water, the cock attached to the cube was turned quickly
on and off; the quantity of gas which entered the tube in this
 brief interval was su<U+FB02>ieient to cause the needle to be driven to
 the stops, and steadily held between 60° and 70°.
    The gas being again removed, the cock was turned once half
 round as quickly as possible.         The needle was driven in the
 <U+FB01>rst instance through an arc of 60°, and was held permanently
 at 50°.
    The quantity of gas which produced this last effect, on being
 admitted into a graduated tube, was found not to exceed one
 sixth of a cubic inch in volume.
     The tube was now taken away, and both sources of heat
 allowed to act from some distance on the thermo-electric pile.
 When the needle was at zero, ole<U+FB01>ant gas was allowed to issue
 from a common argand burner into the air between one of the
 sources of heat and the pile.         The gas was invisible, nothing
 was seen in the air, but the needle immediately declared its pre
 sence, being driven through an arc of 41°.           In the four experi
 ments last described, the source of heat was a cube of oil heated
 to 250° Centigrade, the compensation cube being <U+FB01>lled with
 boiling water*.
     Those who like myself have been taught to regard transparent
 gases as almost perfectly diathermanous, will probably share the
 astonishment with whiehI witnessed the foregoing effects.                I
 was indeed slow to believe it possible that a body so constituted,
 and so transparent to light as ole<U+FB01>ant gas, could be so densely
 opake to any kind of calori<U+FB01>c ray; and to secure myself against
 error, I made several hundred experiments with this single sub
 stance. By citing them at greater length, however, Ido not think I
    * With a cube
                    containing boiling water I have since made this experi
 ment visible to a large audience.

 180                 Prof. Tyndall      on Me Absorption   and
could add to the conclusiveness of the proofs just furnished, that
the case is one of true calori<U+FB01>c absorption *.
     § 6. Having thus established in a general way the absorptive
                                                       “ What is the relation
power of olc<U+FB01>ant gas, the question arises,
which subsists between the density of the gas and the quantity
of heat extinguished?”
    I sought at <U+FB01>rst to answer this question in the following way :—
An ordinary mercurial gauge was attached to the air-pump; the
experimental tube being exhausted, and the needle of the galva
nometer at zero, ole<U+FB01>ant gas was admitted until it depressed the
mercurial column 1 inch, the consequent de<U+FB02>ection being noted ;
the gas was then admitted until a depression of 2 inches was ob
served, and thus the absorption effected by gas of l, 2, 3, and
more inches tension was determined.                 In the following Table
the <U+FB01>rst column contains the tensions in inches, the second the
de<U+FB02>ections, and the third the absorption equivalent to each de
<U+FB01>ection.

    No de<U+FB01>nite relation            between the density of the gas and its
absorption       is here    exhibited.      We see that an augmentation of
the density seven times about doubles the amount of the absorp
tion 3 while gas of 20 inches tension effects only 2% times the
absorption of gas possessing 1 inch of tension.“
    But here the following re<U+FB02>ections suggest themselves :—It is
evident that ole<U+FB01>ant gas of 1 inch tension, producing so large a
de<U+FB02>ection as 56°, must extinguish a large proportion of the rays

posing the quantity of gas <U+FB01>rst introduced to be so inconsiderable
that the number of rays extinguished by it is a vanishing quan
tity compared with the total number capable of absorption, we
might reasonably expect that in this case a double quantity of
gas would produce a double effect, a treble quantity a treble
effect, or in general terms, that the absorption would, for a time,
be proportional to the density
    To test this idea, a portion of the apparatus, which was pur
posel omitted in the description already given, was made use
of.     0, Plate III., is a graduated glass tube, the end of which
dips into the basin of water B.             The tube can be stopped above
by means of the stopcock r; d d is a tube containing fragments
of chloride of calcium.          The tube 00 being <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>lled with
water to the cock r, had this water displaced by ole<U+FB01>ant gas;
and afterwards the tube S S', and the entire space between the
cock 1' and the experimental tube, was exhausted.                   The cock n
being   now   closed  and    1" left  open,   the  cock    7' at the top of the
tube   00    was carefully turned on and the gas permitted to
enter the tube S S' with extreme slowness.                  The water rose in
 O 0, each of whose smallest divisions represents a volume of I'Uth
 of a cubic inch. Successive measures of this capacity were
 admitted into the tube and the absorption in each case deter
 mined.
    In the following Table the <U+FB01>rst column contains the quantity
 of gas admitted into the tube; the second contains the corre
 sponding de<U+FB02>ection, which, within the limits of the Table, ex
 presses the absorption; the third column contains the absorp
 tion, calculated on the supposition that it is proportional to the
 density.

182                 Prof. Tyndall    on the  Absorption and
   This Table shows the correctness of the foregoing surmise, and
proves that for small quantities of gas the absorption is exactly
proportional to the density.
    Let us now estimate the tensions of the quantities of gas with
which we have here operated.             The length of the experimental
tube is 48 inches, and its diameter 2'4 inches; its volume is
therefore 218 cubic inches.           Adding to this the contents of the
cocks and other conduits which led to the tube, we may assume
that each <U+FB01>ftieth of a cubic inch of the gas had to diffuse itself
through a space of 220 cubic inches.             The tension, therefore, of
a single measure of the gas thus diffused would be
an atmosphere,—a tension capable of depressing the mercurial
                                                                mth          of
column connected with the pump 3évth of an inch, or about leth
of   a millimetre    l
    But the absorptive energy of ole<U+FB01>ant gas, extraordinary                as it
is shown to be by the above experiments, is far exceeded by that
of some of the vapours of volatile liquids.              A glass <U+FB02>ask was
provided with a brass cap furnished with an interior thread, by
means of which a stopcock could be screwed air-tight on to the
<U+FB02>ask.      Sulphuric ether being placed in the latter, the space
above the liquid was completely freed of air by means of a
 second air-pump.         The <U+FB02>ask, with its closed stopcock, was now
 attached to the experimental tube; the latter was exhausted and
 the needle brought to zero.            The cock was then turned on so
 that the ether-vapour           slowly entered the experimental tube.
 An assistant observed the gauge of the air-pump, and when it
 had sunk an inch, the stopcock was promptly closed.                 The gal
 vanometric de<U+FB02>ection consequent on the partial cutting off of
 the calori<U+FB01>c rays was then noted; a second quantity of the
 vapour, suf<U+FB01>cient to depress the gauge another inch, was then
 admitted, and in this way the absorptions of <U+FB01>ve successive
 measures, each possessing within the tube 1 inch of tension,
 were determined.
     In the following Table the <U+FB01>rst column contains the tensions
 in inches, the second the de<U+FB02>ection due to each, and the third the
 amount of heat absorbed, expressed in the units already referred
 to.   For the purpose of comparison             I  have placed the corre
 sponding absorption of ole<U+FB01>ant gas in the fourth column.

  For these tensions       the absorption of radiant heat by the
vapour of sulphuric ether is more than twice the absorption of
ole<U+FB01>ant gas.     We also observe that in the case of the former
the successive absorptions approximate more quickly to a ratio
of equality. In fact the absorption produced by 4 inches of
the vapour was sensibly the same as that produced by 5.
    But re<U+FB02>ections similar to those which we have already applied
to ole<U+FB01>ant gas are also applicable to ether.     Supposing we make
our unit-measure small enough, the number of rays <U+FB01>rst destroyed
will vanish in comparison with the total number, and for a time
the fact will probably manifest itself that the absorption is
directly proportional to the densit . To examine whether this
is the case, the other portion of t e apparatus, omitted in the
general description, was made use of.       K is a small <U+FB02>ask with a
brass cap, which is closely screwed on to the stopcock c'.        Be
tween the cocks c' and c, which latter is connected with the ex
perimental tube, is the chamber M, the capacity of which was
accurately determined.        The <U+FB02>ask It was partially <U+FB01>lled with
ether, and the air above the liquid removed.         The stopcock 0'
being shut off and 0 turned on, the tube S S' and the chamber
M are exhausted. The cock 0 is now shut off, and 0' being
turned on, the chamber M becomes <U+FB01>lled with pure ether vapour.
By turning   (.1 off and
                       c    on, this quantity of vapouris  allowed to
 diffuse itself through the experimental tube, and its absorption
 determined; successive measures are thus sent into the tube,
 and the effect produced   by    each
                                   is   noted.   Measures of various
 capacities were made use of, according to the requirements i of the
vapours examined.
     In the <U+FB01>rst series of experiments made with this apparatus,   I
 omitted to remove the air from the space above the liquid   ,-  each
 measure therefore sent in to the tube was    a    mixture of vapour
 and air.    This diminished the effect of the former; but the
 proportionality, for small quantities, of density to absorption
 exhibits itself so decidedly as to induce me to give the observa
 tions.   The <U+FB01>rst column, as usual, contains the measures of
 vapour, the second the observed absorption, and the third the cal
 culated absorption.     The galvanometric de<U+FB02>ections are omitted,
 their equivalents being contained in the second column.           In
 fact as far as the eighth observation, the absorptions are merely
 the record of the de<U+FB02>ections.

   Up to the 10th measure we <U+FB01>nd that density and absorption
augment in precisely the same ratio.        While the former varies
from 1 to 10, the latter varies from 41'5 to 45.            At the 20th
measure, however, a deviation from proportionality is apparent,
and the divergence gradually augments from 20 to 30.              In fact
20 measures tell upon the rays capable of being absorbed,—the
quantity destroyed becoming so considerable, that every addi~
tional measure encounters a smaller number of such rays, and
hence produces a diminished effect.
   With ether vapour alone, the results recorded in the following
Table were obtained.    Wishing to determine the absorption ex
ercised by vapour of very low tension, the capacity of the unit
measure was reduced to <U+FB02>'mth of a cubic inch.

    vapours.    The method of experiment was in all cases the same
    as that just employed in the case of ether, the only variable ele

   As far as the sixth measure the absorption is proportional to           ’
the density; after which the effect of each successive measure
diminishes. Comparing the absorption e<U+FB02>‘ected by a quantity
of vapour which depressed the mercury column half an inch,
with that effected by vapour possessing one inch of tension, the
same deviation from proportionality is observed.

   These numbers simply express the galvanometric              de<U+FB02>ections,
which, as already stated, are strictly proportional to the absorp
tion as far as 36° or 37°. Did the law of proportion hold good,
the absorption due to 1 inch of tension ought of course to be
296 instead of 18'8.
   Whether for equal volumes of the vapours at their maximum
density, or for equal tensions as measured by the depression of
the mercurial column, bisulphide of carbon exercises the lowest
absorptive power of all the vapours which             I  have hitherto ex
amined.    For very small quantities, a volume of sulphuric ether
vapour, at its maximum density in the measure, and expanded
thence into the tube, absorbs 100 times the quantity of radiant
heat intercepted by an equal volume of bisulphide of carbon
vapour at its maximum density.          These are the extreme limits

            Radiation of Heat by Gases and Vapours.                           187
of the scale, as far as my inquiries have hitherto proceeded.
The action of every other vapour is less than that of sulphuric
ether, and greater than that of bisulphide of carbon.
    A very singular phenomenon was repeatedly observed during
the experiments with bisulphide of carbon.        After determining
the absorption of the vapour, the tube was exhausted as perfectly
as possible, the trace of vapour left behind being exceedingly
minute. Dry air was then admitted to cleanse the tube.           On
again exhausting,  after the <U+FB01>rst few strokes of the  pump a jar was
felt and a kind of explosion heard, while dense volumes of blue.
smoke immediately issued from the cylinders.         The action was
con<U+FB01>ned to the latter, and never propagated backwards into the
experimental tube.
   It is only with bisulphide of carbon that this effect has been
observed.                         I
             It may, think, he explained in the following man
ner :—-To open the valve of the piston, the gas beneath it must
have a certain tension, and the compression necessary to produce
this appears su<U+FB02>icient to cause the combination of the consti
tuents of the bisulphide of carbon with the oxygen of the air.
Such a combination certainly takes place, for the odour of sul
phurous acid is unmistakeable amid the fumes.
   To test this idea              I
                        tried the effect of compression in the air
syringe.    A bit of tow or cotton wool moistened with bisulphide
of carbon, and placed in the syringe, emitted a bright <U+FB02>ash
when the air was compressed.       By blowing out the fumes with
a glass tube, this experiment may be repeated twenty times with
the same bit of cotton.
   It is not necessary even to let the moistened cotton remain in
the syringe.    If the bit of tow or cotton be thrown into     and      it,
out again as quickly as          can be ejected, on compressing
                                       it

brighter <U+FB02>ash than atmospheric air. These facts are in bar
mony with the above explanation.

produced      by benzole with a measure possessing only T‘ath of a
cubic inch in capacity; and yet for equal tensions of 05 of an
inch, alcohol cuts off precisely twice as much heat as bcnzole.
There is also an enormous difference between alcohol and sul
phuric ether when equal measures at the maximum density are
compared; but to bring the alcohol and ether vapours up to a
common tension, the density of the former must be many times
augmented.         Hence it follows that when equal tensions of these
 two substances are compared, the difference between them dimi
 nishes considerably.       Similar observations apply to many of the
 substances whose deportment is recorded in the foregoing Tables;
 to the iodide and chloride of amyle, for example, .and to the pro
 pionate of ethyle.       Indeed it is not unlikely that with equal
 tensions the vapour of a perfectly pure specimen of the sub
 stance last mentioned would be found to possess a higher
 absorptive power than that of ether itself.
     It has been already stated that the tube made use of in these
 experiments was of brass polished within, for the purpose of
 bringing into clearer light the action of the fecbler gases and
 vapours.      Once, however, I wished to try the effect of chlorine,
 and with this view admitted a quantity of the gas into the ex
 perimental tube. The needle was de<U+FB02>ected with prompt energy;
  but on pumping out *, it refused to return to zero. To cleanse
 the tube, dry air was introduced into it ten times in succession ;
  but the needle pointed persistently to the 40th degree from zero.
  The cause of this was easily surmised: the chlorine had attacked
  the metal and partially destroyed its re<U+FB02>ecting power; thus the
  absorption by the sides of the tube itself cut off an amount of
  heat competent to produce the de<U+FB02>ection mentioned above.                  For
  subsequent     experiments   the  interior   of  the tube   had   to  be   re
  polished.
      Though no other vapour with which           I had experimented pro
  duced a permanent effect of this kind, it was necessary to be
  perfectly satis<U+FB01>ed that this source of error had not vitiatcd the
  experiments.      To check the results, therefore,      I had a length of
  2 feet of similar brass tube coated carefully on the inside with
   lampblack, and determined by means of it the absorptions of all
  the vapours which     I  had previously examined, at a common ten
   sion of 0'3 of an inch. A general corroboration was all I sought,
   and I am satis<U+FB01>ed that the few discrepancies which the mea
   surements exhibit would disappear, or be accounted for, in a
   more careful examination.

    The order of absorption is hero shown to be the same in both
 tubes,   and the quantity absorbed in the bright tube            in                          is,
 general,  about 4%  times that  absorbed in  the black one.  In the
 third column, indeed, have placed the products of the numbers

                                     4'5. These results completely
 dissipate the suspicion that the effects observed with the bright
tube could be due to         change of the re<U+FB02>ecting power of its
                                          a
inner surface           by
                   the contact of the vapours.
    With the blackened tube the order of absorption of the fol
lowing substances, commencing with the lowest, stood thus :—
                        Alcohol,
                        Sulphuric ether,
                        Formic ether,
                        Propionate of ethyle;
whereas with the bright tube they stood thus :—
                        Formic ether,
                        Alcohol,
                        Propionate of ethyle,
                        Sulphuric ether.
   As already stated, these differences would in all probability
disappear, or be accounted for on re-examination.       Indeed very
slight differences in the purity of the specimens used would be
more than suf<U+FB01>cient to produce the observed di<U+FB01>'erences of ab

         the above paper    1‘, page 92 (2nd paper),M. Siemens states,
LIN“ It may         be asserted without all doubt, that the most expe
rienced and skilful physicists, even with the best instruments and
most appropriate localities, are not able to determine resistances
in absolute measure which do not vary several per cent.               A stand
ard      so little accuracy would not even answer the requirements
         of
of  technical purposes.”       M. Siemens, however, does not give the
grounds on which he bases the above assertion.

electrical science.”    I  have always understood that the determina
tions of resistances in absolute measure bchber’s methods were
most accurate      ; and in order to be able to answer this point more
de<U+FB01>nitely, wrote to Prof. W. Thomson and asked him to give
              I
me his opinion on the subject, knowing that the opinion of such
a   distinguished physicist would have great weight—in fact,
would settle the question.
    Prof. Thomson’s answer was the following :—
    “ There can scarcely be doubt but that Weber’s original deter
                                  a
 mination     ofresistance in absolute measure (I’ogg. Ann. vol. lxxxii.

 of the two methods srparatcly present so much consistence, that the
possibility    of so great an error as one half per cent. could not be
 admitted in the mean result               either considered alone, unless
                                               of
 through some error in the corrections directly applied to it.              Any
 such doubt seems perfectly removed                  by
                                                the close agreement between
 the two results derived from the two different methods, with di<U+FB02>crcnl

    2. M. Siemens states, page 93 (2nd paper), “Because the differ
ences found in the conducting powers of the gold-silver alloys
I  had made in different places amount to 1'5 per cent., the alloy is
useless for the purpose proposed by me (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1861),
namely, the reproduction of a resistance by means of which the
observations of different experimenters may be compared With
each other, or the reproduction of a resistance in absolute mea
sure.   For if two alloys are made and their resistances deter
mined, we should certainly come within one half per cent. of the
true value, six out of the eight alloys tested agreeing within
that limit.” Let us now for a moment see what M. Siemens
says of his proposed mercury standard ; and on referring to                                                      his

    M. Siemens, when speaking of the differences he found, says
they are not greater than were to be expected; and further on, he
continues, the temperatures         the étalon (copper) and the mercury
                                              of
varied 2—3° C. during the experiments but does not state which      ;
of the determinations were made at the higher or lower tempe
rature, so that the differences he <U+FB01>nds may be greater or smaller,
as the case may be. Now on comparing the above values                  will                                it
be seen that the maximum differences are in each case the same.
If, therefore, in the opinion of M. Siemens, the gold-silver alloy
is  useless as   a  standard, how much more must his mercury
standard be so, when, according to his own determinations with
‘     Prof. Weber, in letter written
                                 a      short time since to Prof. Thomson,
                                                     a
states, when speaking of some new determinations of resistance in absolute
measure he isabout to undertake, that by some improvements in the me
thod and apparatus he hopes to arrive at a still greater accuracy than that
which he formerly obtained.

the same mercury in tubes carefully picked from a large quan
tity, he does not arrive at a greater accuracy than                                                I  did with
alloys made in diverent places, by di<U+FB02>'ererzt persons, of dz<U+FB02>erenl
gold and silver, and drawn by di<U+FB02>erent wire-drawers. If, on the
contrary,           I     had made ‘and drawn the eight alloys myself of the
same gold and silver,                             I should undoubtedly have obtained re
sults not varying 0'1 per cent.                                        If new different experimenters
determine the conducting power of mercury, is it not probable
that much greater differences would be found between their
results than those obtained by M. Siemens himself? Now it so
happens that different observers have already determined the
conducting power of mercury. Let us compare their results ; and
we will <U+FB01>rst compare the conducting powers of the metals,
taking silver =100, and afterwards taking mercury =100.
Now       I    maintain that if the values obtained for one and the
same metal by these different observers agree better when com
pared with silver than with mercury as unit, then M. Siemens’s
proposed standard must be useless as such.

    These results prove that the mercury standard proposed by
 M. Siemens cannot be a useful and good one; for, in fact, we
obtain more concordant results if we take in the above series any
other metal as unit.       The mercury employed by three of the
 observers was stated by them to have been pure.
    3. Page 93 (2nd paper), M. Siemens states, “German-silver wire
is much better for resistance coils than the gold-silver alloy, on
account of its high conducting power and expense.”          I quite agree
 with him. 1 only proposed the gold-silver alloy to be used for
 the same purpose as he does mercury.
    4. Page 93 (2nd paper), M. Siemens states, “ Even             the con
 ducting power of the gold-silver alloys were the same, yet small
resistances cannot be accurately compared with them, as there
                                                                          '
 would always be a slight di<U+FB02>‘erence in the resistance at points
 where the alloy is connected with the connectors of the almamtus.”
 I  may, however, mention that       I always solder the ends of the
 normal wire to two thick copper wires (of 2—3 millims. diameter
 and about 35 millims. long), the free ends of which are carefully
 amalgamated by dipping them into a solution of nitrate of mer
 cury in dilute nitric acid ; and the connexions are made by means
 of mercury cups, the bottoms of which are amalgamated copper
plates.     These can be removed, and are of course from time to
 time reamalgamated.       The free copper ends of the normal wire
 are reamalgamated every time before use. This arrangement gives
 most satisfactory results; not the slightest change in the resist
ance is observed when the normal wire is taken out of the mer
 cury cups and put in again.        If, however, a wire of the gold
 silver alloy has once been made and arranged for use, when
 wanted it is only necessary to reamalgamate the ends, and it may
then be used without further loss of time.          On the contra , for
 M. Siemens’s proposed unit there must be a great deal 0 time

and the In<U+FB02>uence        of Temperature       on the Resistance      of Metals. 199
spent in cleaning the tube (in which operation the tube is liable
to be broken) and in purifying the mercury.
   5. Page 95 (2nd paper), M. Siemens gives a table, by which
he wishes to prove that he is able to reproduce resistances of
exactly the same values.        He, however, only proves that he is
able to <U+FB01>ll the same tubes with different mercury, and that their
resistances only vary 0'05 per cent.; for he compared three un
known resistances with two equal ones (when reduced to equal
lengths and diameters), and obtained very nearl the same values.
Now   if, instead of taking normal tubes, calle          and     he had
                                                                   3       7,

observed than the mean of the conducting powers of the relative
volumes of the metals employed; and as in no case             had foundI
an increment        the conducting power of

ducting power of mercury.
  As mercury behaves in this respect differently from the other
metals, instead of assuming, as   did in my paper on the con
                                        I
ducting power of alloys*, that the metals may be classed under
two heads, viz.,—
1. Those metals which, when alloyed with each other, conduct
     electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes;
11. Those metals which, when alloyed with one of the metals
     belonging to the first class orwith one another, do not conduct
     electricity in the ratio of their relative volumes, but always
     in   lower degree than the mean of their volumes,—
          a
we must now have three classes of metals, the third probably

    For the calculations, the conducting power of tin was taken at
 17209, that of bismuth 17'88 ; the speci<U+FB01>c gravity of mercury
 13'573, that of bismuth 9823, and that of tin 7'294.
    The resistances of the amalgams were determined in the same
 tube as the mercury, so that any error in the measurement of the
 length or diameter will'not have any in<U+FB02>uence on the relative
values obtained.
    From the above Table we see that even bismuth, a worse con
 ductor than mercury, increases the conducting power of mercury,
 as would be expected from the above assumption.                         The experi
 ments with the amalgams show how important it would be, if
 mercury were to be taken as unit for determinations of resistances,
 that it should be absolutely chemically pure.                      We cannot be
 surprised to <U+FB01>nd discrepancies in the values obtained for mercury
 by different observers, when such small traces of impurity so
 materially affect its conducting power.
    7. Page 103 (2nd paper), M. Siemens gives a Table, from
 which he deduccs that the increase in the resistance of mercury
 between 0° and 100° C. is in direct ratio with the increase of
 temperature.     In other words, M. Siemens assumes that the
formula
                                  w: 1 + at
expresses the resistance of mercury at any temperature between
0° and 100°.      Let us now calculate from his results the values

                                   as there is a gradual increment
in the values there can be no doubt that a formula'with two

    FLEEMING JENKIN, C.E.1
        an article in the last May Number of this Magazine, “ On
 IN   the Galvanic Polarization of buried Metal Plates,” translated
from Poggendor-H’s Annulm, N0. 10, 1860, Dr. Carl describes
 certain interesting experiments on the electro-polarization       pro_
 duced between two large zinc plates buried in the garden of the
 Observatory of Munich, by opposing and by augmenting the
natural earth-current between them by the application of a single
element of Daniell’s;        and concludes with the following re
mark :—
    “ The above
                   experiments disclose nothing at variance with tln
known laws of galvanism; but it nevertheless appeared to me ad
visable to make them known, as they afford a simple explanation
 of certain phenomena which Professor Thomson has described
 (Report of the Twenty-ninth Meeting of the British Association,
 Aberdeen, 1859, Trans. of Sections, p. 26), and which he seems
to attribute to entirely different causes.”
    In the report of Prof. Thomson’s communication to the Bri
 tish Association here referred to, it is stated that (after mention~
 ing certain experiments by Mr. F. Jenkin on submarine cables
 coiled in the manufactory of Messrs. Newall and Co., Birkenhead,
in which one end of the battery used, and one end of the cable
experimented on, in each case was kept in connexion with the earth

experiments were in the contrary direction to that which the true
 discharge of the cable would give ;” and at Prof. Thomson’s
          “ Mr. Jenkin repeated the experiments,
request                                                           watching care
 fully for indications of reverse currents to those previously noted.
 It was thus found that the <U+FB01>rst effect of pressing down the key
 [to throw the cable from battery to earth through galvano
meter] was to give the galvanometer a deflection in the direction
corresponding to the true discharge current, and that this was
 quickly followed by a reverse current generally greater in degree,
which gave a deflection corresponding to a current in the same
 direction as that of the original <U+FB02>ow through the cable.
    “ Professor Thomson explained this second current, or false
 discharge, as it has since been sometimes called, by attributing
it to mutual electro-magnetic induction between different parts of
the coil, and anticipated that no such reversal could ever be
found in a submerged cable. The effect of this induction is to
produce in those parts of the coil <U+FB01>rst in<U+FB02>uenced by the motion
of the key, a tendency for the electricity to <U+FB02>ow in the same
direction as that of the decreasing current <U+FB02>owing through the
remoter parts of the coil.     Thus, after the <U+FB01>rst violence of the
back <U+FB02>ow through the key and galvanometer, the remote parts
of the cable begin, by their electro-magnetie induction on the
near parts, to draw electricity back from the earth through the
galvanometer into the cable again, and the current is once more
in one and the same direction throughout the cable.”

201;      Prof. W. Thomson and Mr. F. Jenkin            on the   True and
    The phenomena         thus described and explained are entirely
different from any that could result from the galvanic polarization
supposed by Dr. Carl to account for them*.                It is true that the
discharging earth-plate might become polarized by the discharge
in certain cases suf<U+FB01>ciently to cause a slight reversal in the cur
rent through the galvanomcter coil, after the subsidence of the
violent discharge current through it. But in no case could the
whole quantity of electricity <U+FB02>owing in this supposed polariza
tion current be more than a very small fraction of the quantity
which previously <U+FB02>owed in the true discharge current, of _which
it is a feeble electro-chcmical re<U+FB01>exion.            Its effect on the gal
vanometer needle must in every case be as nothing in com
 parison to the great impulsive de<U+FB02>ection produced by the true
 discharge current ; and there is no combination of circumstances,
 as to size of the earth-plates, amount of the battery power, and
 rapidity or sensibility of the galvanometer needle, in which the
 cause supposed by Dr. Carl could possibly be adequate to explain
 the phenomena described in Prof. Thomson’s communication.
     In point of fact, all effects of polarization of the earth-plates
 were extremely small in comparison with the main currents
 observed, which in the experiments               on cables with one and
 kept to earth, consisted of (1) the constant through-current, pro
 duced by a battery of 72 elements Daniell’s in series ; (2) the
 true discharge through the galvanometer to be observed instantly
 after breaking the battery connexion of the end of the cable to
 which the battery was applied, and making instead a connexion,
 through the galvanomcter coil, between the same end of the
  cable andthe earth ; and (3) the
                                          “ false discharge, ” so called be
 cause it must have been often mistaken for the true discharge,
 which almost necessarily escapes notice altogether when short
 lengths of coiled cable are tested with slow galvanomcter nee~
     " They are also different from any effects which could result from polari
  zation of the plate connecting the far end of the cable with earth—a cause
  suggested by Prof. thutstone in a report published by the Committee
  appointed by the Board of Trade to inquire into the Construction of Suh
  marine Cables.     In support of his opinion, Prof. VVheatstone quotes some
  experiments in which he could observe only the well-known effects due to
  polarization, which on the short pieces of wire at his command quite over
    owered both the true and false discharge. The current from the polarized
  end of a cable is always in the direction of the true discharge when the
  battery has been long enough applied :_ it is observed on both straight and
  coiled cables, and is capricioust variable. ‘ The details given in the present
  paper show that the currents due to olectro-magnctic induction, called
  false discharge currents, are on the contrary always in the oppOsitc direc—
  tion to that of the true discharge, that they can only be observed on coiled
  cables, and that they are in each case sensibly constant.       The galvano
  mcter used by Mr. Jenkin would not have been de<U+FB02>ected half a degree by
  the current from a polarized earth-plate at the end of cables from {500
  to 500 knots in length.

                  False Discharge         of a    Coiled Electric Cable.         205
 dles.   The through-current (l) was measured at the beginning
 of the discharge experiments by introducing the galvanometer
 into the circuit of cable and battery.                           Neither the whole
 amount of the true and false discharges, nor the rapidly varying
 strength of the current from instant to instant, could be distinctly
 observed, because the period of vibration of the galvanometer
 needle, being about 4% seconds each way, was neither incompa
 rably greater nor incomparably smaller than the duration of the
 current in either direction. Thus the back-flow, or true dis
 charge, which was of comparatively short duration, <U+FB01>rst gave
 the needle an impulse to the left (let us suppose); but before
 its natural swing, from even an instantaneous impulse, could
 have allowed it to begin to return, it was caught by the reverse
 current of false discharge and turned and thrown to the other
 side of zero through an angle to the right, which, except in the
 cases of the longest lengths of cable experimented on, was much
 greater than the angle of the <U+FB01>rst de<U+FB02>ection to the left.                      It is
 obvious from         what      has been     stated, that the durations of these
 de<U+FB02>ections of the needle on the two sides do not even approxi
 mately coincide with the times during which the current <U+FB02>owed
 in the directions of the true and false discharges respectively,
 but that they depend in a complicated manner on the inertia of
 the needle and the varying forces to which it is subjected. The
 general character of the phenomena will be made suf<U+FB01>ciently
 clear by the following examples, which are quoted from letters of
 Mr. Jenkin’s to Prof. Thomson, of dates April 9 and April 22,
 1859.

   If  the whole duration of current, with or without reversal,
through the galvanometer coil had been in<U+FB01>nitely small in com
parison with the natural time of oscillation of the needle (which,
reckoned in one direction, was about 412» seconds), the recoils
would have been sensibly equal to the <U+FB01>rst throws in the con
trary direction, being only less by the effect of resistance of the
air, 8L0. to the motion of the needle.      Hence the numbers in
 the last column of the preceding Table prove that at some inter
val of time, not incomparany less than 4% seconds, after the
<U+FB01>rst motion of the needle, there was a current through the gal~
vanometer coil opposite in direction to that which produced the
<U+FB01>rst or rig/1t deflection, in each case except N0. 5, or that in
which the remote end of the cable was insulated.           It may be
safely  assumed  that  the conductors  used  in cases 2,  3,  and 4- to
give the stated resistances between    the  remote end of the cable
and the earth, exercised no sensible electro-magnetic        influence,
and held no sensible charge, in the actual circumstances; and it
is interesting to see how the greater the resistance thus intro
duced, that is to say the more nearly the remote end is insulated,
the greater is the <U+FB01>rst throw (due, as explained above, to true
discharge), and the less is the excess of the recoil above it.
    This excess, shown in the last column of the Table, exhibits
the etfect of the electro-magnctic induction~ from coil to coil
which stops short the true discharge, and produces after it a
reverse current constituting the “false discharge.”           The fol
lowing experiments, performed by      Mr.   Jenkin   on  the   19th of
April, 1859, on different lengths of the Red Sea cable, illustrate
the relations between true and false discharge.
  ‘ The resistance of this unit            was found by experiment to be equal to about
190x l06 British absolute units of feet per second, or to     nautical miles         ti}
of the Alexandria and Candie cable, or to 4‘39 of the Dardanelles, or to 7'44
of the Red Sea.

       or in several coils, and on the dimensions of the coil or coils, as

city of the near portions of the conductor has an effect analogous
to that of Fizcau’s condenser in the Ruhmkortf coils; and there
was little or no spark (none was observed, although it was
looked for, in the key) on breaking the battery circuit, and con
sequently, as nearly as may be, the whole mechanical value of
the current left by the battery must have been expended in the
development of heat in the conductor itself, and by induced
currents in the iron of the sheath; and therefore we need not
wonder at the great length of time during which electric motion
remains in the cable.
    The <U+FB01>rst column of results for experiments Nos. 1, 2, and 3,
and the two columns for Nos. 4, 5, and 6, show that the con
tinued <U+FB02>ow of the main current through the cable, after the near
end is removed from the battery and kept insulated, is to reduce
its potential gradually from that of the battery (which for the
moment we may call positive), through zero, to negative, in some
time less than <U+FB01>ve seconds, and to keep it negative eVer after, if
it is kept insulated, as long as any trace of electro-dynamic
action remains’l‘.      It is probable that, at the same time, there
may    be  oscillations  of current backwards and forwards again            1',
and of potential to negative, and positive again, in some parts,
especially towards the middle, of the cable.          The mathematical
theory of the whole action       is very easily  reduced    to equations;
but anything like      a complete practical analysis   of these equations
presents what may be safely called insupcrable                 dif<U+FB01>culties,
 because of the mutual electro-magnetic         in<U+FB02>uence of the differ

them.      These peculiar dif<U+FB01>culties do not, theoretically viewed,

will be found practicable after the cable is laid.
   The theoretical conclusion that the “false discharge” would
not be observed in submerged cables, has been recently veri<U+FB01>ed
        J
by Mr. enkin on various lengths of Bona cable up to 100 miles,
which he was engaged in recovering, and which, under careful
tests, never gave the slightest indication of “false discharge,”
although, even when the remote end had completely lost insula
tion, they gave not only polarization effects *, but also, in the same
direction as these, but distinguishable from them, indications of
true discharge. ' But, in fact, a fortnight before the theoretical
conclusion was published by Prof.~ Thomson at the Aberdeen
meeting, a most remarkable and decisive experimental demon
stration of it was published by Mr. Webb, Engineer to the Elec
tric and International Telegraph Company, who had indepen
dently discovered the phenomena which form the subject of
this paper, and given substantially the same explanation as that
which we now maintain.           If
                                 there could be a doubt as to the
electro-magnetic theory, the following extract from a letter of
Mr. Webb’s, published in ‘The Engineer’ of August 26, 1859,
is decisive :—

 return current.        I have had perhaps peculiar facilities for obser
 ving this striking phenomenon.            Whilst picking up a cable at
 sea, I frequently test the length I am operating on for return
 current ; and as the cable becomes coiled into the ship the de<U+FB02>ection
 of the  needle, when testing    for return current, becomes reversed.
    “It   is also my practice to cut the cable at certain distances
 as it is picked up, and then test such sections separately.               On
 these occasions, sections which, when one end is insulated, will
 give a charge and discharge of 5°, will when that end is to earth,
 give a current at the battery end, after contact, of 90°, but in the
 reverse direction to that in which the discharge or return current
would be if the cable were laid out straight.”
 XXVI.      On the Movements of Gases.           By J.   A. WANKLYN, De
      monstrator of Chemistry in the University          of Edinburgh’F.
         HEN     a gas heavier than air is placed in a cylindrical
 w          vessel closed at the top and open at the bottom, it does
not descend rapidly. In like manner, a gas lighter than air con~
taincd in a cylinder closed below, but freely communicating with
the atmosphere above, does not move upwards with rapidity.
    By simply placing a gas in a vertical cylinder shut at one end,
the ordinary course of gravitation is disturbed—t0 how great an
 extent few people would anticipate.
    The following experiments show how remarkably the fall of
gases is retarded by such an arrangement.
    A tube-1' <U+FB01>lled with carbonic acid was allowed to remain with
its mouth open and directed downwards for the space of <U+FB01>ve
 seconds.     After the lapse of that time, the gaseous contents of
the tube were analysed in order to ascertain how much carbonic
acid had made its escape.
    The composition of the gas was—

    The differences observed between the quantities of gas which
escaped in the same times in the different experiments are no
doubt caused by the action of currents of air which are produced
by the act of unclosing the tube, which currents are necessarily
variable in extent and direction.           Though it would be idle to
draw any inference as to the precise numerical relation subsist
ing between times of exposure and quantities of gas fallen, yet
these oscillations in our different experiments do not at all affect
the certainty of the general result.
    In <U+FB01>ve seconds about one quarter of the carbonic acid escaped ;
in twenty seconds about one half.
    Let us translate this into retardation of the fall of the gas.
    Our tube was 232 millimetres long. Therefore, in <U+FB01>ve seconds
three-fourths of the gas cannot have fallen more than 60 milli
metres in vertical distance. By comparing this with the distance
through which carbonic acid, contained in a balloon, would fall
in <U+FB01>ve seconds, we arrive at an estimate of the retardation which
we seek to measure.
    At <U+FB01>rst sight, the cause of this retardation would appear to be
friction between the carbonic acid and air which must enter
 to supply the place of the carbonic acid.           But if we carefully
consider the conditions undEr which we <U+FB01>nd the gases in these
experiments, we shall see that another explanation is possible.
    For, notwithstanding the absence of cohesion in gases, the
 carbonic acid in our experiment seems to be very much in the
condition of water in the two arms of an equal-armed siphon;
the essential difference between the two cases being that, where
as the cohesion betwecn the particles of water hinders all move

stratum of molecules alone whose gravitation would tend to
cause motion.     All the molecules, situated above the plane of
contact between our gas and the air, Would be in equilibrium, as
the descent of one of them would involve the ascent of another.
   During the <U+FB01>rst instant the lowest plane of carbonic acid
would change place with the uppermost plane of air. Thus                   a
plane of air-molecules would be interposed between the mass of
carbonic acid above and plane of carbonic acid-molecules below.

 In moving through any <U+FB01>nite portion of the medium, the body
 would encounter an in<U+FB01>nite number of times its weight of the
 medium.      It would therefore have to communicate its motion to
 its weight multiplied        by   in<U+FB01>nity.

214       Mr.  J. A. XVanklyn  on the Movements   of Gases.
   Hence in traversing a <U+FB01>nite space its velocity would become
32 feet divided by in<U+FB01>nity.    It would therefore require an in
<U+FB01>nite time to traverse a <U+FB01>nite space. A fortiori, in a second it
could not traverse a <U+FB01>nite space.
   In like manner, any <U+FB01>nite time being assigned, it can be shown
that in that time no <U+FB01>nite space can be traversed.
   We are thus led to expect that carbonic acid should not
escape from a tube more rapidly when its mouth is turned down
wards than when it is turned upwards.        Nor does the fact, that
in the actual experiment the escape was more rapid in the former
position than in the latter, disprove the proposition; for in
the experiment there is a very great imperfection: viz., it is im
possible to open a tube without creating a current.         When a
current is set up, the gas moves en masse, and then it is quite
conceivable how gravitation can increase the movement; so that
the descent of a quarter of the gas in our experiments is no proof
that if the tube could be opened without disturbance there would
be a higher rate of egress than there is when simple diffusion
acts.
   In order to show experimentally that it is the upward cur
rent of air which produces the retardation, the following expe
riment was devised and executed.
   A tube 9 to 10 millimetres in diameter and 242 millimetres
long was provided with ground-glass plates, closing both top
and bottom.      The top was <U+FB01>xed on with tallow, and the tube
used as though it consisted of a single piece.        It was <U+FB01>lled
with mercury and inverted in the mercurial trough, when it
proved to be tight.    Carbonic acid was then introduced in the
usual way.     The tube charged with that gas was then closed
with the other ground-glass plate and rem0vcd from the trough.
The top was taken off.       The bottom was then removed and
replaced   in <U+FB01>ve  seconds.   The top was then put on, and the
tube taken back to the trough, and its gas passed into a
graduated tube and examined.       It consisted of almost pure air:
91'111 vols. left 90'665 vols. not capable of absorption by
potash.
   This shows clearly that, however we may account for the mode
of action of the upward current of air, it is the upward current
which produces the remarkable retardation forming the subject
of this paper.
   Here it may be well to mention that a trial was made to
ascertain the extent of movement produced by simple diffusion.
The tube employed in the six <U+FB01>rst experiments was <U+FB01>lled with
carbonic acid and exposed, mouth opening upwards, for <U+FB01>ve
seconds.
   Only about 3 per cent. of carbonic      acid had left the tube,

and probably even that small amount was chie<U+FB02>y due to the
disturbance on opening the tube.
   The following experiment was made with hydrogen (not dried).
The same tube as was used in the six <U+FB01>rst experiments was <U+FB01>lled
with that gas and exposed for <U+FB01>ve seconds, with the open end
upwards.      The residual gas after the experiment contained—

    It will be obvious, on a little consideration, that the same
causes are in operation in thi instance as in the former instances
where carbonic acid refused to descend.
    To show that the same phenomena occur in very wide tubes,
the following experiments may be cited.
    A tube, 38 millimetres in diameter, 256'5 cubic centimetres
in capacity, but of the same length (232 millim.) as the former
tube, was <U+FB01>lled with carbonic acid.
    The residues in different experiments consisted of—
                      Exposure  of  5 seconds.          Exposure  of 105 seconds.

   The loss of carbonic acid is therefore greater than when the
narrow tube is employed.            We may explain this by the greater
extent of current, which is of necessity produced on unclosing a
wider tube.
    Lastly, an experiment may be brought forward in which a
mixture of gases, was used, and in which the point aimed at was,
whether or not relative change takes place in the composition of
a mixed gas.
    The mixed gas was prepared by heating oxalic acid with
sulphuric acid*. An analysis previously to the experiment gave—
                   Carbonic acid         .      .          50'62

    After exposure in the narrow tube opening downwards                        for
60 seconds, the product contained—
   * No doubt a trace of 80" was present, but this it was not deemed
necessary to remove.

                         By M. llOLZMANN, Ph.D.*
          continuing my former researches on the cerium com
 ()N pounds'f,l         found a new class of double nitrates of cerium
 which do not contain the cerium in the state of protosesquioxide,
 but simply as protoxide.           I prepared the cerium double salts of
 ammonium, potassium, strontium, magnesium, zinc, manganese,
 nickel, cobalt, and uranium, partly by dissolving the metal in a
 solution of nitrate of protosesquioxide of cerium containing a
 considerable quantity of free acid, partly by mixing the solutions
 of the two nitrates.         The deoxidation of the protoeesquioxide of
 cerium was effected in the <U+FB01>rst case by the hydrogen generated
 in dissolving the metal; in the second by boiling the nitrate of
 protosesquioxide of cerium with alcohol.                   If the solution of
 the cerium-salt contains an excess of nitric acid, the alcohol must
 be added in small quantities, as the disengagement of gas causes
 a violent ebullition. The analyses of the ammonium, magnesium,
 zinc, manganese, nickel, and cobalt salts were already <U+FB01>nished,
 when a paper was published by L. Th. Langei, in which the
 same salts are described,—in consequence of which I have dis
 continued my research, and will now only state those of my ob
 servations which do not agree with Langc’s.
    The double salt of nitrate of cerium and nitrate of magnesium,
 prepared by myself, is not of a pale pink colour, but perfectly
 colourless, and only contains six atoms of water of crystal
 lization. As this composition differs from that of the other salts
                                         I
 belonging to the same group, analysed the products of several
 preparations, but always obtained the same results.                   The salt
 was obtained by mixing equal parts of concentrated solutions of
 nitrate of magnesium and nitrate of protoxide of cerium, and
 leaving the mixture to crystallize over caustic lime and chloride
 of calcium.       The crystals, representing perfectly developed hex

  The double nilrate of cerium and ammonium has not been prepared
by Lange.           It is obtained by mixing equal parts of rather con
 centrated solutions of the two salts, concentrating the liquid

calcium     and     caustic  lime.   If the liquid cools gradually, it soli

therefore only to half the quantity of nitric acid contained in the salt.

stantaneously oxidized, and at the same time a dirty green pre
cipitate was formed.                In this way even a very small quantity of
the proto-sesquioxide may be detected; for the liquid, when dilute,
directly assumes a red colour.
    The nitrate of the protoxide of cerium seems to form double
salts with the nitrates of some of the organic bases, with the in
vestigation of which I am now engaged.
    A mixture of the solutions of proluc/iloria'e of cerium and biclrlo
ride ofplalinum, when highly concentrated, deposits on cooling
orange-coloured crystals, easily soluble in water and alcohol, but
insoluble in ether.               They fuse in the water-bath, and are deli
quescent in moist air.                 An alcoholic solution, when slowly eva
porated     over   chloride        of   calcium, often furnishes perfectly deve
loped rectangular prisms.                   For analysis, the salt was twice recry
stallized from water and dried over caustic lime and chloride of
calcium.
    (1) 09615 grm., treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, gave,
after <U+FB01>ltering and igniting the sulphide of platinum, 0'2375 Pt.
The <U+FB01>ltrate, boiled and precipitated with oxalate of ammonium,
gave 0'2671 Ce3 0".                  The remaining liquid, when treated with
nitrate of silver, gave 1'3185 Ag Cl.
    (2) 0782 grm., dissolved in alcohol and mixed with chloride
of ammonium, gave after ignition of the ammonio-chloride of
platinum 0'1904: Pt. The <U+FB01>ltrate, precipitated by oxalate of
ammonium, gave 0'22 Ce8 0‘.
    (3) 06215 grm., treated in the same manner, gave 0151 Pt,
and 01724 Ce8 0“.

   The double chlorides of manganese or magnesium with plati
num differ from this composition; for their formula, according
                                                            '

Bonsdorff*, is M Cl, Pt Cl‘M-GHO.
    When mixed solutions of protochloride of cerium and iodide of
zinc are left for some time over chloride of calcium, a syrupy
mass is generally obtained; very rarely a crystalline double salt
is deposited from the solution.    I have not succeeded in purify
ing this compound, as it attracts water with great avidity, and
can hardly be recrystallized in consequence of its extreme solu
bility in water and alcohol.    On concentrating a solution of the
salt in the water-bath, iodine is liberated.

   In conclusion may mention that oxalate of cerium, lanthanium,
or didymium may be obtained in perfectly developed rhombohe
drons, attaining often a diameter of 2 or 3 millims., when dissolved
in moderately concentrated nitric acid and allowed to evaporate
slowly over caustic lime. An acid salt, however, is not obtained in
this way, even when free oxalic acid is dissolved together with the
oxalate: for 0'7968 grm. of oxalate of cerium, dried over caus
tic lime and chloride of calcium, left, on ignition, 0'3605 Ce8 0",
corresponding to 36'70 per cent. of cerium; and 1'3862 grm.,
burnt with oxide of copper, gave 04784 CO2 and 04175 HO,
corresponding to 9‘41 per cent. of carbon, and 3'35 per cent. of
hydrogen. The formula C4 O8 Ce9+8HO requires 3651 of
cerium, 9'52 of carbon, and 3'18 per cent. of hydrogen.       When
the nitric acid is employed in a too concentrated state, and when
the solution is heated to ebullition, a partial decomposition takes
place, and a mixture of crystals of the oxalate and of free oxalic
acid is obtained.

other persons whom         Ihave asked to perform the experiment,
have observed; but these are liable to exceptions.           Occasionally,
the librating spectrum observed at the end of the tube in the
<U+FB01>rst part of the experiment, acquires afaint rose, green, or violet
tint.    Sometimes      have seen the spectra of the right and left
                         I
eyes, in  the  second  part of the experiment, reversed as regards
colour.
   These facts appear to prove the following propositions :—
   1.  That colour sensations may be excited in the retina, or
brain, altogether independently of any external colour-stimulus.
   2. That as an optical analysis of white light may be effected
by a  prism, so with the eye we possess the power of effecting,
what may be called, its physiological analysis.
   3. The last proposition tends to the conclusion that white light
consists of three fundamental colours—magenta, emerald-green,
and indigo-violet—corroborating      in   remarkable manner the
                                                      a

subject.

in the other, although this latter has not been exposed to the

in<U+FB02>uence of light in any part of the experiment; that, in a word,
a very close sympathy exists in the two retime, of which the
consentaneous action of the two irides is probably but a re<U+FB02>ex
nervous consequence.
    I  may here allude to a distinction in ocular spectra which has,
I   believe, not been taken much account of by observers of these
phenomena.       Some spectra seem as if projected on the plane to
 which we direct the eye, and in that case appear, as have found       I
 from numerous measurements, linearly magni<U+FB01>ed in proportion
 to the distance of the eye from the plane of projection.       Other
 spectra, on the contrary, are perceived, so to say, in the eyeball
 itself, and are ofa subjective nature.      Independent of the dif
 ferences of their apparent seats, the two classes of spectra pre
 sent certain other well-de<U+FB01>ned distinctions.       Projected spectra
 are only perceived with the eyes open, and are generally but
 faint in colour; while subjective ones may be seen with the eyes
 shut, and are always intense in colour.      At the same time am                   I
 disposed to ascribe  the differences  of colour, in a certain degree,
 to the diluting influence of extraneous light; for projected
 spectra are always seen more vivid in a dark room than in day
light.
     The green spectrum observcd on a sheet of white paper, after
 prolonged contemplation       of a red wafer, has been commonly
 explained thus :—“ “'hen the eye has been for some time <U+FB01>xed
 on the red wafer, the part of the retina occupied by the red
 image is deadened by its continued action, and insensible to the
 red rays which form part of the white light from the paper;
 consequently will see the paper of that colour which arises from
 all the rays in the white light of the paper, but the red; that                        is,
 of bluish-green colour, which
      a                                  therefore the true complemen
                                                   is
 tary colour of the red wafer*.”
     That this explanation       not correct seems to me to be proved
                                          is
 by the following experiment :—

                  rather to corroborate Plateau’s view. If the two halves of card                     a
                  painted red and green respectively be illuminated           green or  by   a
                  red light, they appear black.      In the same way, but depending
                  on different cause, the two halves of the card,
                       a                                               viewed through
                                                                               if
                  green or red glass, appear black.
                     Another set of observations, connected in        degree with the
                                                                               a
                  preceding, may    be here  noticed.    Chevreul§  distinguishes  two
                  chief species of contrast  of  colours, simultaneous and successive
                  contrasts. But an examination of these distinctions shows them
                  in my judgment to be more apparent than real, and but the
                  expression of one fundamental fact, viz. that the eye on per
'r'r              ceiving any one colour acquires     atendency to see its complemen
“                 tary. Thus, to take an example of Chevreul’s simultaneous
                  contrast :—-If slip of red and one of yellow paper be viewed
                                      a

                           side, near the line of contact the red paper inclines to
                  violet, the yellow to green.      The rationale of this      at once       is
                  obvious: the red mingling with the complementary of yellow,

and this same law holds good in the juxtaposition of any two
colours whatever.      By the term successive contrast Chevreul
designates   the  familiar   phenomena of complementary           ocular
spectra,  of which    most   comprehensive history has been given

et seq.    Du Tour* thought that the two eyes cannot perceive
each     separate colour at once.
           a                         He says that    e. y.,_a blue disc
                                                                   if,
be presented   to one eye and     yellow one to the other, the result
                                              a
is that the mind perceives alternately the one or the other colour,
but not the two at once. But           would submit that these two
                                                  I
statements do not include the whole facts of the case.              took          I
two tubes,   each  10%  inches long,  and applying the end    of  one to
each eye, viewed the sky through them.          found that when the

contiguous edges of the tubes at their further ends were some
inches apart, two distinct white circles of sky were seen; these
circles touched when the edges of the tubes were from 27'; to 2,1;
inches apart, and, when closer, the two circles appeared as one.
If now the further end of one tube was covered with apiece of
green glass, the end of the other with       piece of red, as long as
                                                           a
the ends of the tubes were kept not closer than           to 2,1; inches  2%
asunder the two coloured discs were perceived perfectly distinct
from one another; no alternation of either colour to the exclusion
of the other, as in Du Tour’s experiment, ensued, so long as the
tubes were inclined to each other at this or any greater degree
of divergence.
   Another very interesting series of phenomena depending on
the intrinsic sensibility of the eye to the impressions of colours,
are those of coloured shadows.      The <U+FB01>rst exact observations on
these were made               by
                      Count Rumford'l'. He observed that the two
shadows of an object placed in front of      white ground, froma                             a
white and     coloured light, were of the two colours complemen
                    a
tary to the latter.      have investigated this fact
                                  I                     little more        a
closely.   The method adopted has been to throw        white and           a                 a
coloured (red) circle of light from two magic lanterns on      white               a
screen, before which       slender wooden rod was placed.

easy to satisfy ourselves that the red shadow     produced      theis                by

    The following facts seem to form the basis of the explanation
of coloured shadows :-—First, the experiment of Rumford*,—
that      piece of grey paper placed next to
           a                                                   piece of coloured

                              a           with   the  exclusion of extraneous
light, appears tinged with the complementary colour. Secondly.

                my own experiments that                   dark room, the screen

greenness      of the shadow     and   the  redness    of  the  ground on which
it  appears are inversely proportional to one another. By approxi
 mating the red light to the screen this becomes redder, whilst
 the shadow of the rod placed before                   becomes less green and
                                                                    it

 other hand, removing the red light till                leaves the white screen

 but faintly tinged with red, brings out the green shadow very
 prominently, and on admission of light into the room,                       second    a
 faint  red  shadow    comes    out.
     Meusnier observed “that when the sun shone through hole                               a

            an absolute Standard.                 By WILHELM Want-inf.
 §     1.   Explanation      of   the absolute       unit   of   measure   for Electric
                                      Resistances.
       there are measures for time and space, special fundamental

no special fundamental measure for electric resistance       needed             is                 if
there are measures for electromotive force and for intensity of
the current; for then that resistance can be taken as unit
measure, which       CIOsed conductor possesses in which the unit
                         a                                                                         of of

tensity.    Upon this depends     the reduction of the measurements
of electric resistance to an absolute standard.
   It might be thought that this reduction would be more simply
effected        by
              reverting to the special dimensions, length and sec
tion, and adhering to that metal (copper) which        best <U+FB01>tted and is
is most frequently used for such conductors.         In that case the
absolute unit of measure of resistance would be that resistance
which     copper conductor possesses whose length
            a                                            equal to the      is
measure of length, and whose section         equal to the measure of
                                                        is
surface, in which, therefore, besides measure of length and sur
face, thc specific resistance    copper must be given as unit for the

                   The question then arises, as to what are the measurements of
               electromotive forces and intensities?    In measuring these magni

              bar magnetism.      The absolute measures of bar magnetism and of
              terrestrial magnetism are known from the treatise of Gauss,

                 From this statement      it   isclear that the measures of electric
              resistances can be referred to an absolute standard, provided mea

    measures, the measure of mass does not come into consideration,
    as follows from the following summary of the simple relations
    which are established by the determination of the absolute mea
    sures of these various kinds of magnitude.
       As fundamental measures, there are to be considered the mea

hence if the four numbers f, s, m, t are determined, the number
w is also directly obtained.   The numberfis obtained by mea
suring the area of the plane embraced by the conductor; s is
found by measuring the time; and there only remain the num
bers m and t, which are obtained by measuring the bar mag—
netism by the method described by Gauss in the above paper.
The unchangeability of the unit of measure for electric resistance
can accordingly be guaranteed so long as the four given measures
(space, time, and the units of measure for the earth’s magnetism
and for bar magnetism) are obtained unchanged.            But it by no
means follows that the maintenance of these four given measures
is a necessary condition for the unchangeability of the unit of
measure of electric resistances ; the simple maintenance of that
unit of measure for velocities is suf<U+FB01>cient for the purpose.

the preceding paragraph, are adequate for the determination of
electric resistance, presuppose circumstances on the convenient

Remembering that the current passing through the circle B also
traverses the circle A, we might also calculate the action of the
circular current A upon the needle in C ; but, for the sake of
simplicity, it may be assumed that the distance AC is so great
that this action vanishes in comparison with the action of the
circular current B; in that case the aclual/y observed de<U+FB02>ection
of the needle in C gives directly the value of a.

of nearly 105 square metres. This ring was placed vertically,
and by means of a winch could be rapidly rotated in a semi
circle, so that the perpendicular upon the plane of the ring at
the commencement and at the end of the rotation coincided with
the magnetic meridian.     The other 153 kilogrammes were used
for the ring B, which consisted of 1854 windings, giving toge
ther a section 202 millims.in breadth, and 70'9 millims. in height:
the internal diameter of this ring was 303'51, and the external
37441 niillims. This second ring was <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xed, and its plane
coincided with that of the magnetic meridian.            In the centre of
this second ring B, a small magnetic needle 60 millims. long,
provided with a mirror, was suspended by a <U+FB01>lament of silk, as
in a small magnetometer; and the Oscillations and de<U+FB02>ections of
the needle were observed with a telescope, directed to the mirror,
on a scale about 4 metres from the mirror.
   The observations were made in the following manner.                The
ring  A   was  <U+FB01>rst   so  placed  that  its  plane   coincided   with  the
magnetic meridian,      and  the needle   in the  middle  of the ring was
thereby brought to rest; thereupon the ring A was suddenly
turned 90°.     By this means the needle in the middle of the ring
was set in rotation, and by means of the telescope the position
of the needle was observed on the scale at its greatest (positive)
de<U+FB02>ection after half an oscillation.       After a complete oscillation,
and therefore an oscillation and a half after the beginning, the
needle attained its greatest de<U+FB02>ection on the opposite side, which
Was also observed on the scale.         In the moment at which the
needle passed its original position of rest, and therefore two
oscillations after the beginning of the experiments, the ring A
was rotated 180°.        The oscillating needle was thereby arrested
in the middle of its motion, and thrown backwards, upon which
its greatest negative and greatest positive de<U+FB02>ections were observed
on the scale.    After the expiration of four oscillations from the
commencement, that        is,  at the moment at which the needle
returning   from  its  last de<U+FB02>ection  passed its original poaition of
rest, the ring was again turned forwards           by180°, and then the
 same oscillation observed as in the <U+FB01>rst case, and in this manner
the experiments were continued until          asuf<U+FB01>cient series of obser
vations was obtained.         For each series, in the <U+FB01>rst column of
the following Table are given the de<U+FB02>ections observed on the scale
 and arranged in order under one another; in the second column
the mean between two            successive   positive    or negative   de<U+FB02>ec
tions are added.   In the third column are the differences of the
mr-ans referring to positive and negative de<U+FB02>ection, that     the      is,
magnitude of the whole arc.

  We are to take into account the in<U+FB02>uence of the fact that the
  rotation of the ring A cannot be effected in a time so small that
  it can be neglected in comparison with the time of oscillation of
  the needle.      From this we obtain for a the value

    Finally, on account of the great distance of the two rings in a

    if T' is the terrestrial magnetism for A, T” for B, we have
                               T' : T"=47O : 471.
        These observations are suf<U+FB01>cient for determining the resist
    ance of the whole closed conductor; and by accurate calculation

               § 4. Application of     the principle of Deadening.
         Instead of using terrestrial magnetism to obtain an clectromo
     tive force which can be referred to an absolute measure, bar mag
     netism may be employed ; in that case it is obvious that the most
     convenient position for the bar-magnet whose magnetism is to be
     used, will be in the centre of the ring formed by the closed con
     ductor. The magnet may then either be <U+FB01>xed, and the ring
     moveable about its diameter at right angles to the magnetic axis
     of the bar; or inversely, the ring may be <U+FB01>xed and the magnet
     moved backwards and'forwards about that diameter.             In the
     latter case a strong oscillating magnetic needle may be used, sus
     pended in the centre of the ring.

             Resistance according to an absolute Standard.           237
     The current produced in the closed conductor by the electro
 motive force arising from the bar magnetism of a magnetic
 needle oscillating in the centre of the ring, itself reacts accord
 ing to the principle of deadening on the oscillating needle, and
  produces a diminution in the amplitude of its oscillations which
  can be observed with great accuracy; and the intensity of this
 current may also, from these observations, be determined accord
 ing to an absolute standard with great accuracy.             It is then
 evident that the current does not need to be passed through a
 second ring serving as galvanometer, in order to measure the
 intensity of the current. Hence the whole conductor, whose
 resistance is to be measured, can be used to form a single ring
 which serves at once for indicator and multiplicator.
     According to this simpli<U+FB01>cation, the observation of the arcs of
 oscillation of a magnetic needle oscillating in [/18 centre of the ring
 is suf<U+FB01>cient: by their magnitude the strength of the electromo
 tive force, and by their decrease the intensity of the current
produced in the closed conductor by that electromotive force,
can be determined.
     In executing the observations according to this principle of
 deadening, it is of prime importance that the magnetism of the
needle Oscillating in the centre of the ring be very powerful;
 and also that the length of the needle be very small as com
pared with the diameter of the ring, in order that, in calculating
 the resistance, there shall be no necessity for an accurate know
ledge of the distribution of the magnetism in the needle, the
 determination    of which would be dif<U+FB01>cult. In the ring now
solely used, which is that previously called B, and which has
 303'51 millims. internal, and 374'41 millims. external diameter,
 and is 202 millims. in height, a magnetic needle 90 millims. long,
and as strong as possible, was suspended.         The experiment was
commenced by detaching from each other the ends of the wire
forming the ring. The needle was then set in oscillation, and
its time of oscillation and the decrease of its amplitude, or the
logarithmic decrement of this decrease, was determined accord
ing to the method given by Gauss in the ‘ Results of the Obser
vations of the Magnetic Verein in the year 1837*.’           Thereupon
the annular conductor was closed, and the same observations
repeated. The results of these observations are given in the fol

    force of a small magnet oscillating in the centre of a circular
     conductor, whose magnetic axis makes the angle ¢ with the
     plane of the circle, is directly proportional to its magnetism M,
    to the cosine of the angle             ¢, and to the velocity of rotation            (3:3,

        the researches of the ancient geometers a problem presented
 IN itself   to them in an almost tangible shape; the eye was a most
 important auxiliary to the brain; and, without questioning the truth
of the old French de<U+FB01>nition, “La géométrie est une science par
 laquelle on raisonne droit sur des <U+FB01>gures faites de travers," there is
no doubt that a well-drawn <U+FB01>gure would often suggest a property or
 method of investigation which might otherwise have escaped; and
 at any rate the ancients never contemplated reasoning on symbols
 which bore no resemblance whatever to the <U+FB01>gure.                The modems,
 however, without any loss of distinctness of conception, have, by the
 introduction of symbols, gained important advantages.                    Among
 others, they have freed themselves from the necessity of verifying
 their results in every variation of ease arising from a mere change
 of position in the data of a problem, and they have acquired an
 almost unlimited power of generalization.
    The coordinate geometry was one of the <U+FB01>rst grand steps in this
 direction; but many important additions have been made since Des
 cartes; and of late years new methods of investigation have been
 pursued which bid fair to carry science onwards with a speed and
safety hitherto undreamt of.
    The book before us makes known in a simple and intelligent
 manner the characteristic features of these new methods; it seems
 especially prepared with reference to the wants of students in the
 University of Cambridge, and will prove a valuable complement to
 the works now in use there as text-books.                 In his preface, the
 author says    that his object   in   writing   on the  subject of trilinear co~
 ordinates has mainly been to place it on a basis altogether indepen
 dent of the Cartesian system; but as several results of that system
 are assumed, as, for instance, in the de<U+FB01>nition of a conic, p. 33, and
 in the means of determining the centre of a conic, p. 35, it is oh
 viously not intended to be throughout a perfectly independent Work
 which may he studied without any previous knowledge of any other;

for   a student who should attempt this would <U+FB01>nd his progress stayed
at the beginning of the second chapter.               This, however, does in no
way detract from the merit of the book, which, we repeat, must be
considered as a complement and a valuable step in advance.
     The terms Trilinear coordinates, Anharmonic ratio, lnvolution,
Reciprocal Polars, &c., have been for some years familiar terms in
 the studies of the University of Cambridge; and those who have
read Salmon's ‘ Conic Sections' or Todhunter's ‘Coordinate Geometry,’
know the immense power they confer as a means of investigation;
 but we meet here with a term which to many students will be a new
 one, although the subject owes its existence and vitality chie<U+FB02>y to
 the labours of our own countrymen, Sylvester, Salmon, Boole, Spot
tiswoode, Cayley, and others.              What is a determinant? Answer:
 Write down n rows of symbols with 12 symbols in each row, and en
 close the whole between two vertical lines. That is a determinant.
 It is a conventional form of expressing in a concise manner a com
 plicated function of these 1: symbols; and these same functions are
 so frequently recurring, not only in investigations concerning curves.
 but in almost every branch of mathematical inquiry, that an abridged
 notation for them was absolutely needed. A determinant of 5 rows,
 and therefore containing 25 symbols, would, if written at full length,
 contain 120 terms with 5 symbols in each term, i. e. 600 symbols
 instead of '25. Chapter III. of the book is devoted to a clear exposi
 tion of the simplest laws of combination of these functions, and will
  serve as a most useful introduction to the study of many modern
 scienti<U+FB01>c memoirs.        We are only sorry that Mr. Ferrers does not
  dwell at greater length on them, and give us exact proofs of some
  of the remarkable results to be found in Spottiswoode, Salmon,
  Brioschi. Crelle’s Journal, &c.
      We cordially recommend this little work to those of our readers
  who have mastered the ordinary coordinate geometry.

       In our former experiments *, Cahours                and myself had often
   observed this substance, but we did not succeed in obtaining it in a
   state of purity <U+FB01>t for analysis. Nevertheless, founding our conclu
   sion on the composition of the corresponding sulphur-compound,
   and having regard to the analogies presented by the corresponding
   terms of the arsenic- and antimony-series, we designated this body as

                          C, H,, PO=     (Ca 11,)a  PO *.
  I  have since con<U+FB01>rmed this formula by actual analysis.
      The dif<U+FB01>culties which in our former experiments opposed the
  preparation of this compound in the pure state, arose entirely from
  the com aratively small quantity of material with which we had to
  work.      - othing is easier than to obtain the oxide in -a state of'
  purity, provided the available quantity of material is suf<U+FB01>cient for
  distillation.    In the course of a number of preparations of triethyl
  phosphine for new experiments, a considerable quantity of the
  oxide had accumulated in the residues left after distilling the zinc
  chloride-compound with potash. On subjecting these residues to
  distillation in a copper retort, a considerable quantity of the oxide
  passed over with the aqueous vapours, and a further quantity was
 obtained, as a tolerably anhydrous but strongly coloured liquid, by
  dry distillation of the solid cake of salts which remained after all the
 water had passed over.        The watery distillate was evaporated on the
 water-bath as far as practicable, with or without addition of hydro
 chloric acid; and the concentrated         solution was mixed with solid
 hydrate of potassium, which immediately separated the oxide in the
 form of an oily layer <U+FB02>oating on the surface of the potash. The
 united products were then left in contact with solid potash for
 twenty-four hours and again distilled.             The <U+FB01>rst portion of the
 distillate still contained traces of water and a thin super<U+FB01>cial layer
of tricthylphosphine.         As soon as the distillate solidi<U+FB01>ed, the
 receiver was charged, and the remaining portion—about nine-tenths
 —eollected separately as the pure product.            To prevent absorption
 of water, the quantity required for analysis was taken during the
 distillation.
    With reference to the properties of oxide of triethylphosphine,            I
may add the following statements to the description formerly given'f‘.
This substance crystallizes in beautiful needles, which, if an appreciable
 quantity of the fused compound be allowed to cool slowly, frequently
acquire the length of several inches. I have been unable to obtain
well-formed crystals; as yet I have not found a solvent from which
 this substance could be crystallized.       It is soluble in all proportions,
 both in water and alcohol, and separates from these solvents on
 evaporation in the liquid condition, solidifying only after every
trace of water or alcohol is expelled.             Addition of ether to the
alcoholic solution precipitates this body likewise as a liquid.             The
fusing-point      of  oxide  of  triethylphosphine     is 44°;   the  point of
solidi<U+FB01>cation at the same temperature.         It boils at 240° (corn).
    As no determination of the vapour-density of any member of the
group of compounds to which oxide of triethylphosphine belongs
has yet been made, it appeared to me of some interest to perform
this experiment with the oxide in question. As the quantity of
material at my disposal was scarcely sufficient for the determination
b Dumas’s method, and Gay-Lussac’s was inapplicable on account
of the high boiling-point of the compound, I adopted a modi<U+FB01>ca

weight of the mercury driven out of the other arm. Since intend               I
to publish a full description of this method, which promises to be
very useful in certain cases, I shall here content myself with stating
                                                                         ‘

     These numbers prove the vapour-density of oxide of triethyl
phosphine to be 66'30, referred to hydrogen as unity, or 4'60 re
 ferred to atmospheric air.        Assuming that the molecule of oxide of
 triethyl hosphine corresponds to 2 volumes of vapour*, the spec.
 grav. 0 its vapour=l+li=67, when referred to hydrogen, and 4'63
 when referred to air.         Hence we may conclude that in oxide of
 triethylphosphine the elements are condensed in the same manner as
 in the majority of thoroughly investigated organic com pounds.
     From the facility with which triethylphosphine is converted into
 the oxide by exposure. to the air, even at ordinary temperatures, and
 the very high boiling-point of the resulting compound, in consequence
 of which the vapour of the latter can exert but a very slight tension
 at the common temperature, I am induced to think that the phos
 phorus-base may be used in many cases for the volumetric estimation
 of oxygen. \V hen a paper ball soaked in triethylphosphine is passed
 up in a portion of air con<U+FB01>ned over mercury, the mercury immedi
  ately begins to rise, and continues to do so for about two hours, after
 which the volume becomes constant, the diminution corresponding
  very nearly to the proportion of oxygen in the air.                  To obtain very
  exact results, however, it would be probably necessary in every case
  to remove the residual vapour of triethylphosphine by means of a
  ball saturated with sulphuric acid.
     Oxide of triethylphosphine exhibits in general but a small tendency
  to unite with other bodies.         Nevertheless it forms crystalline com
  pounds with iodide and bromide of zinc.                     I  have examined more
  particularly the iodine-compound.

 to a concentrated solution of dichloride of platinum in absolute

ever, rapidly, the compound formed in the commencement of the
reaction uniting with an excess of hydrochloric acid. The viscous
liquid which ultimately remains behind, when heated loses the excess
of hydrochloric acid, leaving an exceedingly deliquescent crystalline
mass, very soluble in alcohol, insoluble in ether.
    For analysis, the new compound was washed with absolute ether
and dried over sulphuric acid in vacuo, either at the common tem
perature or at 40°.       Three chlurine-determinations in specimens of
different preparations, which, owing to the extraordinary avidity of
this compound for moisture, exhibit greater discrepancies than are

F. T. Gregory, Esq.
    The author <U+FB01>rst described     the granitic and gneissose tract of the
elevated    table-land ranging northwards from Cape Entrecasteaux
and comprising the Darling Downs.          The igneous rocks and quartz
dykes were next referred to, and also the clays, sandstones, and
 conglomerates capping the table-land.         Carboniferous, cretaceous,
and pleistocene rocks were also alluded to; and some evidences of
 the recent elevation of the coast were brought forward.            Besides
 specimens of rocks and minerals, the following fossils from Western
 Australia were exhibited: Carboniferous fossils and cannel-coal from
the Irvin River; Fossils of secondary age (Trigonize, Ammonites, and
 fossil wood) from the Moresby Range; fossil wood from the Stirling
 Range and from the Upper Murchison River; Ventriculites in <U+FB02>int
from Gingin, and Brown-coal from the Fitzgerald River. The
author's views of the geology of the district were shown by an ori

              IN THE AUGUST NUMBER OF THIS JOURNAL.
       DEAR Sm,            To Dr. PVilliam Francis.
             the transmission of my paper on the American crystals of
SINCE   Klaprothine or Laznlite. I have received a communication from
Professor George J. Brush of Yale College, New Haven, informing
 me that the crystals in question do not come from North Carolina,
but from Georgia.          They occur at Graves' Mountain in Lincoln
 County of that State. The North Carolina examples, analysed by
 Smith and Brush, do not appear to have been met with in crystals.
    Prof. Brush also informs me that these Georgian crystals have
been described and figured in a paper by Prof. Shepherd, in the
 American Journal of Science and Arts, vol. xxvii. (2nd series).
 This paper had quite escaped my notice, and I have at present no
 means of referring to it.        I hasten, however, in apologizing for past
 negligence, to point     out   the fact of its publication.    As regards the
 assumed    Trimetric    character   of  these crystals, my  views,  I may ven
 ture  to observe,   remain    unchanged.

                        BY '1‘. STERRY HUNT, r.a.s.
    The formation of a nitrite when moist air is ozonized by means of
the electric spark (the old experiment of Cavendish) or by phos
phorus, was shown by Rivier and de Fellenberg, who concluded that
the reactions ascribed by Schonbein to ozone were due to traces of
nitrous acid. The subsequent experiments of Marignac and An
 drews have, however, established that ozone is really a modi<U+FB01>cation
 of oxygen, which Houzeau has shown to be identical with the so
 callcd nascent oxygen, which is evolved, together with ordinary
 oxygen, when peroxide of barium is decomposed by sulphuric acid
 at ordinary temperatures.        The spontaneous decomposition of a
 solution of permanganic acid also evolves a similar product having
the characters of ozone.                 _
    Believing that the nitrous acid in the above experiments is not an
 accidental product of electric or catalytic action, but dependent
 upon the formation of active or nascent oxygen, I cuuSed a current
 of air to pass through a solution of permanganate of potash mixed
 with sulphuric acid. The air, which had thus acquired the odour
 and other reactions of ozone, was then passed through a solution of
potash; by which process it lost its peculiar properties, while the
potash solution was found to contain a salt having the reactions of a
nitrite.                                                       '
    As I suggested in this Journal in 1848, I conceive gaseous nitrogen
 to be the anhydride amide or nitryle of nitrous acid, which in con
 tact with water might under certain circumstances generate nitrous
 acid and ammonia.        From the instability of the compound of these
two bodies, however, it becomes necessary to decompose one at tl.e
 instant of its formation in order to isolate the other.          Certain
redUcing agents     which   convert nitrous acid into  ammonia may thus
transform nitrogen (NN) into QNHJ.            In this way I explain the
action of nascent hydrogen in forming ammonia with atmospheric
nitrogen in presence of oxidizing metals and alkalics.          (Zinc in
presence of a heated solution of potash readily reduces nitrates and
nitrites with the evolution of ammonia.)
    Now an agent which, instead of attacking the nitrous acid would
destroy the newly formed ammonia, would permit us to isolate the
nitrous acid. Houzeau has shown that nascent oxygen is such an
agent, at once oxidizing ammonia with formation of nitrate (nitrite?)
of ammonia; and thus when ozone (nascent oxygen) is brought in
contact with moist air, both of the atoms of nitrogen in the nitryle
(NN) appear in the oxidized state.
   From this view it follows that the odour and most of the reactions
ascribed to ozone are due to nitrous acid which is liberated by the
decomposition of atmospheric nitrogen in presence of water and
nascent oxygen.        We have thus a key to a new theory of nitri<U+FB01>ca
tion, and an explanation of the experiments of Cloez on the slow
formation of nitrite by the action of air exempt from ammonia upon
porous bodies moistened with alkaline solutions.-Silliman’s Ame
rican Journal for July 1861.

XXXIII.      On the Cohesion-Figures of Liquids. By CHARLES TOM
    LINSON, Lecturer on Science, King’s College School, London*.
                             [With  a Plate.]
WE of       are accustomed to consider a solution as an example
               adhesion, as when water adheres to and dissolves
a salt, or mercury a metal.      In such cases the adhesion is suf<U+FB01>
ciently powerful to overcome the cohesion of the solid.            This
process continues until the adhesion of the liquid and the cohe
sion of the solid counterbalance each other, and we then get
what is called saturation.     The solution of one liquid in another
is also a case of adhesion overcoming cohesion.         The solution of
a gas or of a vapour in a liquid may also be regarded as a case of
adhesion ; but often accompanied by this additional phenomenon,
that the particles of the gas or vapour reassume the cohesive
states of their liquids. For example, if we hold a pellet of sponge'
saturated with sulphuric ether about half an inch over the sur
face of Water, a portion of the vapour of the ether will be con
densed upon the surface in the form of a <U+FB01>lm with a sharp,
well-de<U+FB01>ned edge; and this will continue so long as the sponge
is wet, but diminishing in size as the ether evaporates.            So
powerful is the adhesion between the water and the ether, that,
if the surface of the former be dusted with lycopodium or tripoli,
or any 100se dry powder, the ether vapour will sweep it aside,
and it will be seen, in a state of agitation, outside the edge of the
ether <U+FB01>lm.
   \Vhen one liquid is added to another, and solution takes place
between them, there is always a breaking up of the cohesion of

 one or other      liquid: where there is no solution, there may be
 simply adhesion.         In both cases, whether there be solution or
 not, one of the liquids displays the phenomena of cohesion in a
 characteristic manner.         For example, the essential oils are but
 slightly soluble in water.        If we place a drop of oil of lavender
 on the surface of water, the adhesion of the water will cause it
 to spread out into a<U+FB01>lm; but the cohesion of the oil immediately
 begins to reassert itself; the <U+FB01>lm opens in a number of places,
 forming long irregular arms or processes resembling the pattern
 assumed by wood when it has been much worm-eaten.                    These
processes     tend  to gather up   into separate discs  or  lenticules ; the
 adhesion of the water spreads them out, the cohesion of the oil
struggles to prevent this,,and soon prevails; the almost immediate
issue being the formation of the original drop into a number of
discs with sharp, well-defined outlines and convex surfaces. The
action is often so rapid, and the pattern so complicated, that it
requires repeated observation to become master of all the phe
nomena.         (See Plate IV. principal <U+FB01>gure, and the subsidiary
<U+FB01>gures    (1, b, c, d.)
    Now this struggle on the part of the oil of lavender to pre
serve its cohesion gives rise to a <U+FB01>gure which is characteristic of
the substance, and which         I  propose to name its cohesion-<U+FB01>gure.
It may be regarded as the resultant of the cohesive force of the
substance, its density, and the adhesion of the surface on which
it is placed.     I  believe that every independent liquid has its own
cohesion-<U+FB01>gure.         By an independent liquid,     I mean not a solu
tion ; for in the solutions of solids and liquids cohesion has been
already overcome.
   The cohesion-<U+FB01>gures of liquids can be conveniently studied by
gently placing on the surface of water, of mercury, 8w. a drop
of the substance in question, which we will suppose exerts no
chemical action on the receiving surface.            Now the cohesion
<U+FB01>gures   of   liquids will be more or less permanent in the inverse
ratio of the solubility of the substance.         A drop of one of the
<U+FB01>xed oils placed on the surface of water will spread out into a
<U+FB01>lm, which is characteristic of the substance, and may last some
minutes or even hours, according to the degree of force with
which cohesion rcasserts itself.         A drop of one of the essential
oils will also give a characteristic <U+FB01>lm or cohesion-<U+FB01>gure which
may change every moment from evaporation and display some
beautiful effects of colour; but all these phenomena will be cha
racteristic of the substance in question, and will enable it to
be recognized.        A drop of a substance like creosote, which is
slightly soluble in water, may continue <U+FB01>ve minutes; a drop of
ether or of alcohol may last only a fraction of a second; but
whether the time be long or short, these <U+FB01>gures are typical of the

       Mr. C. Tomlinson       on the Cohesion-<U+FB01>gures       of Liquids.     251
 substances that produce them ; and so sensitive are they to any
variations in the conditions under which they are produced, that
a slight alteration in one of those conditions leads to a marked
change in the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure.           Thus the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure of wood
spirit on water is very different from what it is on mercury, since
the surface attraction or adhesion of mercury is very different
 from that of water.
    Now let us examine the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure of a liquid that is
sparingly soluble in water, such as creosote. If we deliver a drop
of this substance from the end of a glass rod to the surface of
one ounce of water, we may witness a struggle between cohesion
and adhesion that will last about <U+FB01>ve minutes.                  The creosote
sails about on the surface of the water in a state of considerable
agitation, discharging a number of small globules on all sides,
which, in their turn, are greatly agitated; they rotate and dis
appear, leaving behind them a thin silvery <U+FB01>lm. Meanwhile the
parent globule diminishes in size, but preserves all the charac
teristics of its cohesion-<U+FB01>gure, until at length it disappears in
the form of a <U+FB01>lm.        If a second drop of creosote be now placed
on the water, its behaviour will resemble that of the <U+FB01>rst in a mi
tigated form; it will be much less energetic, and will last a
much longer time before it disappears in the form of a <U+FB01>lm. A
 third drop will remain on the surface in the form of a double
 convex lens sharply de<U+FB01>ned, showing that the cohesion of the
 creosote exactly balances the adhesion of the water; or, in other
 words, that saturation has been attained.              If we now add more
 water, or increase its solvent power by the addition of a drop of
acetic acid, the action will set in again, and the lens will change
into the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure. (See Plate.)
    The following comparative experiment was made with fresh
colourless creosote (Morson’s) in two exactly similar shallow
glasses, one containing one ounce, and the other two ounces of
New River water.         In such water adhesion is diminished by its
mineral contents.       In distilled water the phenomena are the
same, but the time is diminished, a drop of creosote disappear

   In   connexion       with
                          creosote, the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure        of carbolic
acid is interesting.  (See Plate.)    It is an exaggerated form of the
<U+FB01>gure of creosote; the water seems to tear it to pieces; the cris
pations are amazingly active, and the disc quickly breaks up and
disappears.     Indeed, while a drop of creosote will endure <U+FB01>ve
minutes in an ounce of distilled water, a drop of carbolic‘ acid
will last only a few seconds in the same quantity of water. The

     is in rapid motion and agitation, but the water seen through the
     central perforation is tranquil.    Both the outer and the inner
     edges of this disc are perfectly sharp and well de<U+FB01>ned.         The
     cohesive force of the ether prevents it from breaking up, and
     even produces a rebound : the disc closes in upon itself, becomes
     smaller and smaller, still preserving its central perforation and
\    well-de<U+FB01>ned form, until at length it vanishes under the in<U+FB02>uence
     of evaporation, adhesion of the water, and probably electrical
     action; or, as is generally the case, the attraction of the sides of
     the vessel causes the mobile body to disappear by dashing up
      against the glass.     If two or three drops be allowed to fall in
      quick succession, the perforated discs become partially super
     posed, hut still preserve their distinctive features, (See <U+FB01>gs. 0, b, c
      in the sulphuric-ether <U+FB01>gure.)
         On placing a drop of recti<U+FB01>ed ether on the surface of water, it
      is evident that it has a much stronger cohesion than when adul
      terated with alcohol, or rather the water has a less adhesion for
     it. The drop of ether becomes lenticular, and in doing so dis
     charges from all sides a portion of its substance, which assumes
      the form of a tolerany smooth <U+FB01>at ring: this in its turn dis
      charges a portion of ether into the water, which, in seizing               it,
     produces     a troubled motion.        Hence we have the true ether
      <U+FB01>gure, consisting    of   central
                                 a        lenticule,  surrounded      by nearly

      were diffusing.  I  have attempted, with the assistance of an artist,
      to represent this in the Plate. It       tolcrably accurate but need
                                               is                 ;        I

                                 a           eye retains such <U+FB01>gures better
      than an artist’s ;  for to the one they are expressions of natural

     which he endeavours to frame into laws; while to the artist
     these things are mere forms—if beautiful, so much the better—
     but still only forms, containing no latent truths.
      I    may also remark that, in order to get the typical form of each
     substance, certain precautions are necessary.          The water may be
     distilled but this not absolutely necessary, provided
              ;            is                                          be che

     becoming quickly saturated;         for  as the   water approaches satu
     ration, the <U+FB01>gure becomes slightly modi<U+FB01>ed, although                  pre
                                                                           it
     sents the no small advantage of greater persistence.                  The
     ether <U+FB01>gure will remain for about              asecond in   a nearly sa
     turated solution. But what          isin many cases absolutely neces
     sary to success       is,that  the    glass containing the water be
     quite clean;      should be puri<U+FB01>ed from the organic <U+FB01>lm which

sulphuric acid, and then in a solution of caustic potash.   If, after
this, the water completely wet the glass, it may be rinsed and
used.   It had better not be wiped. Having been once washed
with sulphuric acid, it will serve for a great number of experi
ments, provided it be washed in a weak solution of caustic pot
ash after each experiment, and rinsed with clean water.          The
substance of which the <U+FB01>gure is to be determined must, as already
remarked, be pure : the <U+FB01>gure given by pure washed ether becomes
changed into the perforated discs by the addition of a few drops
of absolute alcohol to a small quantity of the washed other ; and
the unwashed ether, if exp0sed in an open vessel for a few mi
nutes, will throw off its ethereal portion, and the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure
will quickly pass into the alcohol <U+FB01>gure.    It is quite remarkable
how rapidly this change takes place.        Ihad poured some un
washed ether into a test-glass, from which       Ifed the dropping
tube, and in about ten minutes the ether <U+FB01>gure was completely
superseded by the alcohol one.       Ido not pretend to say that all
the substances made use of in this inquiry are pure.           Ihave
taken pains to procure them from the best sources, such as the
manufacturers themselves;      but some of the essential oils, for
example, are prepared     on the  Continent, and may possibly not
be quite pure.
    There is not so marked a difference between the cohesion
<U+FB01>gures produced by spirits of wine and absolute alcohol as
between unwashed and washed other: nor is this to be wondered
at, seeing that spirits of wine only differ from absolute alcohol
in having already received a portion of the water which the abso
lute aleohol takes up in forming its peculiar <U+FB01>gure on water.
The <U+FB01>gure of spirits of wine consists of a central disc with a
foliated outline surrounded by a tolerably smooth disc.          The
<U+FB01>gure of absolute alcohol (Pl. IV.) has the central disc more
minutely foliated than in the former case, and it has a greater
tendency to a stellar arrangement.
       Without further multiplying these examples,         I
                                                          may once
more recur to the law on which they seem to rest—viz. that each
<U+FB01>gure is the resultant of the cohesive force of the liquid, its den
sity, and the adhesion of the receiving surface.      If
                                                       this be true,
it follows that two liquids although of very different chemical
character, yet being of the same density, similarly cohesive,
whether viscid or <U+FB02>uid, and the adhesion of the receiving surface
being the same       e. having the same degree of solubility), we
                     (i.
get precisely the same cohesion-<U+FB01>gures for both liquids.        Now

liquids. It     true that both are hydro-carbons, and that each

numerous and important.       Nevertheless their physical resem

   blanees are striking: they are of about the same density                  e.
                                                                            (1'.      a
   little heavier than water); they are about equal in liquidity or
   cohesion, and they are both sparingly soluble in water.                  Now
  the cohesiom<U+FB01>gurcs         of these two substances are so much alike
  thata      casual observer would declare them to be identical.            (See
  Plate.) There are the same crispations in the oil of cloves as in the
  drop of creosote; the same <U+FB02>attened, indented, waving, agitated
  outline; the same sailing about     ;.   a  similar <U+FB01>lm, and the same re
  pulsion of the <U+FB01>lm; the same whirling off of small globules, and
  the rapid rotation and disappearance of those small bodies. Like
  the creosote, too, the second drop of oil of cloves reproduces the
  phenomena of the <U+FB01>rst in      a     mitigated form, and      is much longer
  in disappearing.        But now for the differences.        The <U+FB01>lm formed
 by     oil of cloves
                    is    more like smoke, more dense, persistent, and
  plicated    than  that  of creosote; and being constantly driven about
 by     the parent disc, it     becomes powdery, like <U+FB01>ne <U+FB02>our, on the
  surface of the water.         In the midst of this <U+FB01>lm, the parent glo
  bule will sometimes remain for several minutes, keeping               a  clear
  space    of considerable    extent  all  around   it,pulsating    in
                                                                    a    regular
  manner, and <U+FB02>ashing out lines which are visible only by the
 motions of the water.             But the most considerable difference
 between oil of cloves and creosote        is    in their respective duration.
 We have seen that       2    ozs. of New River water will dissolve three
 drops of creosote  ;      the same quantity of river water will not dis
 solve so much as two drops of oil of cloves.              After the <U+FB01>rst drop
 has disappeared,   a     second will be lively at intervals during nearly
 an hour, but after twenty-four hours some small lenticulcs of the
 oil will remain on the water.            Hence oil of cloves has only about              -
 half the solubility of creosote in water—only half the adhesion, in
 fact; but being denser than water,        it     tends to sink, and thus ap.
pears to be more adhesive than       it     really is.   An interesting result
may also be obtained with 01. pimentac, which             is   a  little heavier
than water (1021 to 1044).                 It  is  much more sluggish than
creosote and oil of cloves, but exhibits similar phenomena on a
small scale. If, however, the water be heated to about 110° I“.,
We get  a     large crispating <U+FB01>gure of great beauty. There are special
characters about    it    which
                              I      do not stop to describe.
      Should any one wish to repeat these observations on oil of
cloves, he may have some dif<U+FB01>culty in doing so on account of
the di<U+FB01>iculty of obtaining the pure oil.              The oil of the shops         is
commonly adulterated with the cheaper oils, such as oil of olives
or of almonds, or of turpentine and             I    have ascertained that
                                                                                   is a
                                      ;
single drop       of  oil of  olives  to  twenty drops of oil of cloves
su<U+FB02>icient to prevent         the   formation     of the cohesion-<U+FB01>gure, and
the display of those curious and interesting motions of the pure
oil.      Even in cases where the oil      is   not adulterated, the <U+FB01>xation

256     Mr. C. Tomlinson      on the Cohesion-Figures  Qf Liquids.
of oxygen, simple or ozonized, may prevent the display of these
characteristic phenomena ; but at the same time it will introduce
other results which are equally characteristic.
    Oil of turpentine is also used as an adulterant of the essen
tial oils.     Its presence can be detected by the brilliant iri
descent colours which it imparts to <U+FB01>lms that are otherwise
colourless.      It also makes many oils more limpid, and thus
renders them more active in the display of their peculiar pheno
mena.      Oil of turpentine alone gives a delicate <U+FB01>lm with iri
descent rings and an outer border of minute globules, with
bosses within the edge: these <U+FB02>atten into discs surrounded by
small dots.       Iridescent colours now set in and cover the <U+FB01>lm.
Suddenly the whole <U+FB01>lm opens into holes, which, in the midst of
the colours, have a beautiful e<U+FB01>‘ect.      The <U+FB01>lm slowly disappears,
leaving an outline lace-pattern which lasts for hours.
    Now when oil of lavender is adulterated with turpentine in
the proportion of 5 to 1, the <U+FB01>lm spreads with a brilliant display
of colour, which is characteristic of the turpentine, the lavender
being colourless; at the same time the peculiar worm-eaten
pattern of lavender is more minute, and its action much more
rapid than in the case of the pure oil. By increasing the pro
portion of the turpentine, the characteristics of the latter <U+FB01>lm
override those of the former.
    Now this brings me\to speak of the use to which these cohe
sion-<U+FB01>gures may be applied in detecting adulteration.              It is
perfectly easy to distinguish unwashed ether from recti<U+FB01>ed ether,
alcohol from spirits of wine, &c., by their respective cohesion
<U+FB01>gures.     It is also equally easy to name a varnish, a <U+FB01>xed, or an
essential oil, from the characters of the <U+FB01>lm which a drop of
each substance forms on water.           Having become acquainted
with the characters of each <U+FB01>lm, it is not dif<U+FB01>cult to detect the
<U+FB01>lms formed by mixtures, and even to name the component
parts of a mixture. For example, oil of cinnamon is now worth
about 5s per 02., so that there is an inducement to adulterate it.
 The readiest means of adulteration is with oil of olives or oil of
 sweet almonds.        To be able to detect the adultcration, we must
 become acquainted with the characters of the <U+FB01>lms of all three
 oils. Now, to begin with oil of cinnamon :---As soon as a drop
 of this substance is delivered to the surface of the water, it
 spreads out into a <U+FB01>lm, but the more <U+FB02>uid portion of the oil (the
 elmopten) precedes the <U+FB01>lm in radial lines of minute globules,
 and these form an outer boundary line of detached spots to the
 <U+FB01>lm. The <U+FB01>lm itself even on a large surface of water is not
 more than about an inch in diameter; it is of a beautiful delicate
 structure and silvery re<U+FB02>ection ; its edge is well de<U+FB01>ned, and it
has small bosses just within it.        Almost immediately after its
                                                                         <4

   formation, holes open near the edge, starting into existence and
   altering rapidly, and the <U+FB01>lm separates into a kind of network
   and two or three well-de<U+FB01>ned <U+FB01>at discs.
       When a drop of oil of olives is placed on water, the <U+FB01>rst thing
   that strikes the eye is a beautiful widening rainbow, which seems
   to deposit the <U+FB01>lm and then disappear.         The <U+FB01>lm itself is colour
   less, and it has an indented edge displaying a very light and
   elegant kind of lace-pattern, similar to what,       I believe, is called
   yuipure, in which a raised thread traces the outline. (Plate IV.)
   After a few minutes the pattern vanishes, and the oil collects into
   an irregular trail with ragged edges, surrounded by numerous
    small globules.
       A drop of oil of almonds on water spreads into a large <U+FB01>lm
   with a beautiful lace-like edge, which soon disappears by the
   holes opening into each other. (See Plate.)         The edge separates
   from the parent <U+FB01>lm, and forms small lenticules outside it. The
    edge of the <U+FB01>lm appears a little raised; the holes in it continue
    to open and widen, and the detached pieces shrink up into lenti
    cules ; and in a few minutes the parent <U+FB01>lm has diminished to
    the size of a shilling, surrounded by a number of lenticules of
    various degrees of smallness.
        Now when olive oil is used to adulterate oil of cinnamon, its
    presence may be detected by some of the characters which the
    oil-of-olivcs <U+FB01>lm exhibits alone, and especially by its iridescence.
    I  added one drop of oil of olives to ten drops of oil of cinnamon ;
    and the <U+FB01>lm formed by one drop of the mixture on water exhi
    bited the following characters z—lst. A display of beautiful iri
     descent rings, which shrank into angular masses and so disap
    peared.     2nd. A considerable portion of the <U+FB01>lm gathered itself
    up into a central disc about the size of a wafer.       3rd. This disc
    was surrounded by a delicate perforated silvery <U+FB01>lm which quickly
     evaporated, leaving some minute lenticules which became fringed
     with a kind of frill. And then, 5th. These lenticules exhibited
     minute systems of iridescent rings. These iridescent effects at
     the commencement and close of the observation do not belong
     to oil of cinnamon, but are characteristic of oil of olives.      These
     and the other phenomena are suf<U+FB01>cient to detect the presence of
‘a
     a small portion of oil of olives in oil of cinnamon.     By increasing
     the proportion of the adulterating oil, the properties of the oil of
     olives are displayed more strikingly.
        When one drop of oil of almonds is added to ten drops of oil
     of cinnamon, and one drop of the adulterated oil is placed on
     water, there is a shooting out of minute globules in radial lines,
     which is characteristic of oil of cinnamon; a delicate <U+FB01>lm is
     formed with holes in the edge which close and open again, and
     in a few minutes cohesion gathers up the <U+FB01>lm in the form of

258      Mr. C. Tomlinson     on the Cohesion-<U+FB01>gures      of Liquids.
long, ragged, irregular, oily-looking smears—an effect which is
 characteristic of oil of almonds.
    Alcohol is also used to adulterate the essential oils: its pre
 sence can be detected by phenomena which vary with the pro_
 portions used. There are also special phenomena with each oil,
 that would take a long time to describe.
    The <U+FB01>lms formed by such common oils as sperm and eolza are
also characteristic.      Sperm oil forms a smooth large <U+FB01>lm, which
 occupies   the   whole   surface and is accompanied by iridescent_
rings,   which   disappear when the <U+FB01>lm is formed.               Minute and
 nicely perforated holes open       in  the  <U+FB01>lm,   and  after  a short time
long, thin, narrow cracks open in        it,  darting out from the holes
and often connecting them together like beads on                   a  thread.
These cracks are characteristic of sperm oil. (See Plate.)
    Colza oil forms   a     large smooth <U+FB01>lm, accompanied          by   iride
scent rings, which immediately disappear.               Minute holes open
at the edge at intervals, three or four together, sharp and clean
as  if  punched.      Similar distinct perforations are also formed in
other parts   of  the  <U+FB01>lm and these widen and thicken at the edges
                          ;
until the surface    is   covered with  a   kind of honeycomb-pattern,
the holes pressing together in twos and threes.             The character
istic feature of the eolza <U+FB01>lm     is  to be found in these large holes
with thickened edges grouped together and opening into each
other. After about an hour the <U+FB01>lm becomes whitish and greasy
looking, and the holes are surrounded by dark rings.               It     may
be remarked, however, that an increase of temperature quiekens
and exalts the phenomena of this and other <U+FB01>lms.                   Thus the
effects are more      numerous    and  more    quickly brought about on
a <U+FB01>ne warm day than on dull and cloudy one.
                              a                           The <U+FB01>lms should
also be formed on     a   given <U+FB01>xed area of water, or the <U+FB01>lm of the
same liquid may‘vary in thickness at different times and thus
disturb the phenomena.        I  have found    a  conical foot-glass nearly
4   inches in diameter at the mouth, nearly <U+FB01>lled with Water,
answer well.
    A mixture of sperm and colza in various proportions forms            a
good <U+FB01>lm, in which may be recognized the cracks of the sperm
and the peculiar holes of the colza.     I      think
                                                    it    would be easy for
any one to detect the mixture of these two oils          by    the character    ‘1'
of the <U+FB01>lm. (See Plate.)
I      have thus brie<U+FB02>y indicated the mode of obtaining these
cohesion-<U+FB01>gures, and their value in determining the nature and
purity of various liquids in common use and which are liable to
adulteration, such as sulphuric ether, the essential and <U+FB01>xed oils,

for example, we can decide whether          it   contains alcohol or not.

      A considerable amount of labour requires to be expended on
  these cohesion-<U+FB01>gures         before the subject can be said to be ripe
  for extended practical application; and this labour, if health and
  opportunity be granted me, I intend to bestow on this most
  interesting subject.        It will be necessary to procure many speci
  mens from different markets of the pure liquid, to take the co
“
  hesion-<U+FB01>gure of each sample many times under varying tempera
  tures and hygrometric conditions of the air, to make drawings
  of these <U+FB01>gures, and to decide after repeated trials what is the
  characteristic feature of each liquid as constantly exhibited in its
  cohesion-<U+FB01>gure.         The next step will be to ascertain the charac
  teristics of mixtures of certain liquids made with a view to adul
  teration, and by means of cohesion-<U+FB01>gures to enable the observer
  to state not only whetheraeostly liquid be adulterated, but what
  it is adulteratcd with,- and the relative proportions of the adulte
  rated mixture.        I  have done all this for a moderate number of
  liquids,   but  very    much   remains to be done before the method
  can be considered as complete.           There are also certain scienti<U+FB01>c
  questions to be answered, such as the relations between the
  <U+FB01>gures of isomeric liquids.
      I  am aware that some of the phenomena of <U+FB01>lms on the sur
  face of water have, on a few occasions, attracted the attention
  of philosophers; but no one, so far as            I am informed, has con
  sidered <U+FB01>lms to differ from each other, or to be characteristic of
  the substances which produce them.              The behaviour of <U+FB01>lms has
  generally    had   reference,   in the labours    of others, to some point
  irrespective of the <U+FB01>lms themselves—as in the repulsion-theory
  of B. Prevost* and the epipolic theory of Dutroehet*.
      It was many cars ago observed by Ermann'l- that a drop of
  sulphuric acid eposited on the clean surface of pure mercury
  spreads out into a <U+FB01>lm.          M. Dutroehet <U+FB01>nds that many liquids
  also form <U+FB01>lms on the surfaces of glass, metal, &e., provided they
  be chemically clean ; and he attributes all these phenomena
                                                                         “ an
  développement subit et toujours de courte durée de la force épi
  pelique centrifuge.”         It seems to me (with great submission to
‘
  so distinguished an observer as the discoverer of endosmose and
  exosmosc) that many of the phenomena described as the e<U+FB02>'ects
  of the epipolic force are simple results of cohesion and adhesion.
  M. Dutroehet repeatedly states that his henomcna cannot be
  produced unless the surfaces be absolute y clean.               That, I am
  quite sure, is a correct observation; but the impurities, according

    to my view, do not act in preventing the exhibition of a new
    force, but simply by preventing adhesion.     Many of the pheno
    mena of cohesion-<U+FB01>gures             I
                                  have been unable to produce away
    from home in vessels which have been cleaned and wiped in the
    usual manner; but they have succeeded perfectly when the
    glasses were washed in a weak solution of caustic potash and
    rinsed in clean water.
       I have taken advantage of Ermann’s observation to obtain on
    mercury the cohesion-<U+FB01>gures of sulphuric acid and other sub
    stances which aet chemically when brought into contact with
    water.   In the case of sulphuric acid, the drop spreads instantly
    and covers the surface of the mercury ; but cohesion immediately
    begins to reassert its claims, and forms the acid near the edge
    into large <U+FB02>at bosses, each of which becomes a centre of action;
    minute globules pass in and out of it; similar small globules
    also move to and fro over the rounded edge of the mercury.
    After a few minutes all action ceases: the_<U+FB01>lm contracts with a
    smooth surface and a well-de<U+FB01>ned edge.       A drop of alcohol, or
    of ether held over the sulphuric acid <U+FB01>lm when at its widest,
    gathers it up in an instant into a small disc.    The reason for
    this   is,
            that there      much stronger adhesion between the acid

 XXXIV.       On the Measurement    of Electric Resistance according   to
            an absolute Standard.      By WILHELM Wanna.
                            [Concluded from p. 240.]
 § 5. Comparison of the Resistance determined according to abso
          lute measure witla Jacobi’s Standard of Resistance.
          compare the resistance of two conductors, there     are differ
 TO ent methods          which need no explanation.      The resistances
 considered in the preceding paragraphs           have been   compared
 according to the method examined in this memoir,             and it has
 been found that
                           w:w'=1138:1000.
 If the  <U+FB01>rst resistance be reduced to the second according to this
 proportion, we obtain
                              1000
 while the direct determination      in the preceding paragraph gave
  v                           w' = 189810”.
 From both these closely agreeing values, determined according
 to entirely different methods, the number 19108 will in future
 be assumed as the mean value of this resistance.
     Jacobi has dwelt on the importance of introducing a de<U+FB01>nite
 measure for resistance to be accepted by all physicists, especially
 at the present time, when so many voltaic investigations are being
 made with the most varied instruments, the comparison of whichis
  often of great importance.      For this purpose he has proposed as
  a standard measure     a copper wire, which he has sent to several
  physicists who are engaged with voltaic measurements, and has
  requested them to compare this standard with theirs, and for
  the future to give their measurements in this measure.
     This standard is a copper wire 7169} millims. in length, and
  g millim. in thickness, which weighs 22449,!6 milligrammes.
     The standard introduced by Jacobi, which, it is to be hoped,
  will <U+FB01>nd general acceptance, is by no means supplanted by the

262           M. W. Weber         on the Illcasurement    qf Electric

resistance can be directly

an absolute measure, which can be easily effected b comparing
the resistance determined as above according to an ahsolute mea

    Such a comparison has been made; and it has been found that
the two resistances are nearly as 82 : 10, or, more accurately, as
                                                                                               A." ti'._.

the resistance of    copper wire has been chosen as standard, the
                     a                                              a

unfortunately there       no determinate measure of resistance
                           is                                      for            ;
different pieces  of copper  of the  same   dimensions have different
resistance; and     it
                     follows, therefore, that the value of the induc

             Resistance according to an absolute Standard.         263
tion-constant e is left undetermined within the limits of that
variability of the resistance of copper.      Kirchhoff himself says,
“ Since the conductibility of copper varies within certain limits,
in giving the value of a, only a limited accuracy is of interest.”
Kirchho<U+FB01>' wished to give only an approximate value of e, which
would be suf<U+FB01>cient for his pu ose; and he was the more content
therewith because the metho s and instruments which he used
would scarcely have permitted a better determination of e if he
proposed a perfectly de<U+FB01>nite measure of resistance.
   The interest which an accurate determination of the value a
has, is lost in consequence of that uncertainty in the choice of
the measure of resistance; and it is important to restore it by the
removal of that uncertainty. This may be accomplished by
keeping, not to copper in general, but to the piece of copper
actually used by Kirchhoff in his investigations, and by choosing
the resistance of a wire of this copper 26'154 millims. in length,
and with a section of 684'! square millims. as a measure of resist
ance.    It is thus only necessary to reduce the result found by
Kirchho<U+FB01>", as well as the measures made therewith or referred
thereto, to the measure thus accurately determined in this manner.
Kirchho<U+FB02>‘ took one Prussian inch in a second as a measure of

velocity, and found in this way
                               —192’
from which it follows (since C'=26'154 C) that that resistance
which amounts to 52308 units of the above absolute measure
is the                resistance of a wire of Kirchho<U+FB02>f’s copper the
        $5 of the
length of which is 261541 millims. and the section 584 square
millims. ; in other words, that the measure of resistance chosen
by Kirchhoff is 10043 times that of the above absolute measure.
   Although this value of 6 can only be considered as approxima
tive, it is interesting to compare it with other values which have
been found by entirely different methods and with different in
struments, because an examination of the various natural laws
brought thereby into operation is obtained.          Kirchhotf’s mea
surements refer      to currents   produced by  voltaic induction, and
hence in his case it is the laws of voltaic induction which have
been used in determining the value of 6.        My measurements, on
the contrary, refer to currents produced by magnetic induction,
and hence in this case it is the laws of magnetic induction which
lead to the value of 6.
   First of all, the value of 6 shall be given which is obtained
from my measurements.          It is clear that the value of s can be
determined from these measurements, if only the resistance of.

264            M. WV. \Veber    on the Measurement                 of Electric
Kirchho<U+FB01>’s copper wire is compared with the resistance of
Jacobi’s standard.          I
                        have made that comparison by means of
the wire which Kirchho<U+FB01>‘ kindly sent to me, and can here give
the result of the comparison: it is as follows.
  A piece of Kirchhoff’s wire which was 13'573 Prussian inches
in length and 0'4061 square line in section, had a resistance
                                             J
which was to the resistance of acobi’s standard as
                                         1   :   106.
From this we get the relation of the resistance of the measure
                                                 J
chosen by Kirchhoff to that of acobi’s standard as
                                      144
           u
If J bethe resistance of        J acobi’s standard,            and     W' that of Kirch
ho<U+FB01>"s, we have
                                   I =510180.
                                 W,
Now the resistance of Jacobi’s standard is equal to 5980 million
units of the absolute measure found above; hence, if W be the
absolute resistance,
                                  J      = 5980000000              ;

                                                     is

                      taking for this unit the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of
a   body whose absolute resistance with         length =      and
                                                               a                 1    a

                 is                                          But the
determination of speci<U+FB01>c resistance according to this unit meets
with   a practical dif<U+FB01>culty in the accurate measurement of the

               Resistance according to an absolute Standard.                                                  265
section, especially in <U+FB01>ne wires, and hence, to obviate this dit<U+FB01>-'
eulty, Kirchhoff has indirectly ascertained the section of the wire
by determining its absolute and speci<U+FB01>c gravity.
   N ow the determination of speci<U+FB01>c resistance according to this
unit, presupposes that the resistance of a wire whose length
remains unchanged, but the thickness of which is increased or
diminished, varies inversely as the section.   This has not, how
ever, been proved, and, with the small alterations of section
Which are produced by pressure, can scarcely be proved.        There
is just as much reason for assuming that, if the mass and the
length of the wire remain unchanged, the resistance does not
alter even with a changing section.       On this assumption the
absolute unit would have to be <U+FB01>xed in another way than as
being the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of a body whose absolute resistance
for the length =1 and for a mass =1 is equal to the <U+FB01>xed mea
sure of resistance. According to this, the speci<U+FB01>c resistance of a
body would be determined by multiplying the resistance of a wire
formed of that substance expressed according to the <U+FB01>xed measure
of resistance by its mass, and dividing by the square of its length.
   The speci<U+FB01>c resistances of the wires used by Jacobi, Kirchhoff,
and myself will be determined according to the unit thus <U+FB01>xed;
for apart from the above considerations, this determination is in
any case the most applicable and capable of execution.

  In the last column here and in the upper Table are given the
different values of e which were obtained for the Neumann’s
induction-constant by adhering to the measure chosen by Kirch
hoff, but using the different kinds of copper which have been
mentioned.    Adhering, however, to the absolute measure <U+FB01>xed
as above, C'=C, W'= W, and s has always the value 2.
    § 7. On the constants      of the electric laws which             depend on the
                              choice of measures.
   The law of induced currents propounded by Neumann represents
the intensity of these currents as dependent on a constant the
value of which must be determined from the measures according
to which the magnitudes taken into consideration are to be deter
mined. This eonstant N eumann has called the induction-constant.
Such a constant occurs in the general expression of any natural
law which states how one magnitude is determined by another.
I  may here give a summary of these constants for all the funda
mental laws which refer to electromotive force, intensity, and
electric resistance.  Each of these laws represents the desired
magnitude     as  an expression of other measurable magnitudes,
which has a constant as a factor the value of which is to be de
termined from the measures chosen.
    1. The fundamental law of the voltaic circuit represents the
intensity of the current i as an expression of the electromotive
force e, and of the resistance w ; for, if the constant whose value
is to be determined is called a,
                                              l   e.
                                                  w
This constant a has the following meaning.     If J, E, W are the
absolute measures <U+FB01>xed as above for intensities, electromotive
forces, and resistance; and if          1',
                                 E', W' are the measures actually
used, we  have

Hence using the absolute measure itself, a=1.

270       Sir David Brewster           on the    Action of Uncrystallized Films
the refractive power of the plates and the intensity of the inci
dent pencil.
     This law, though admitted by M. Arago in his article on
Polarization in the Encyclopedia Britannica *, was called in ques
 tion by Dr. Young'l', on the ground that no <U+FB01>nite number of
plates could polarize the whole transmitted         beam, as a small
 portion of light must always remain unpolarizcd, or in the state
 of natural light. This is doubtless true; but, as Sir John Her
 schel has shown, it does not affect the truth of the law, which
 involves the intensity of the incident pencil.       According to the
 law of geometrical progression, indeed, a small portion of unpo
 larized light exists mathematically in the transmitted beam ; but
 a beam of light may be said to be completely polarized when the
 unpolarized portion is invisible, vanishing entirely in certain
 positions of the analysing prism.
     Neither M. Arago nor Dr. Young has made the slightest
 reference to that portion of the refracted light which is re<U+FB02>ected
 at the surfaces of each plate and returned into the transmitted
 beam. Sir John Herschel, however, has distinctly referred to                            it,
 and remarks that “         mixes with the transmitted beam, and,
                                  it
                                                                         '
 being in an opposite plane, destroys       part of its polarization 1.”

    Although the law of the tangent which              have mentioned

 refers only to the transmitted pencil, yet, in the paper which
 contains      it,
                 have shown that the light re<U+FB02>ected back into that
                 I
 pencil   isdistinctly visible, not as ordinary light, as Sir John
 Herschel maintains, but as light polarized in an opposite plane
 to the refracted pencil.
     When the angle of incidence        considerable, this oppositely
                                                 is

three distinguished philosophers       I  have named, and of all sub
sequent    writers;   and  the consequence of this has been that the
true action of a pile of plates or <U+FB01>lms has never been the sub
ject of research during the last forty-six years, though such
piles have been used in some of the most delicate and important
researches in physical optics.
     The dif<U+FB01>culty of procuring transparent plates with parallel
surfaces, and of suf<U+FB01>cient thinness, would have prevented the
 most skilful observer from making any progress in the inquiry ,
           I
and had not been fortunate enough to obtain, from the museum
of the Marquis Campana in Rome, a large quantity of glass in
 different stages of decomposition,    I could hardly have done more
 than con<U+FB01>rm the result which      I obtained in 1813, that the light
transmitted by a pile of transparent plates consists of two por
 tions of light polarized in opposite planes.
     In submitting the <U+FB01>lms of decomposed glass to the polarizing
 microscope,   I  observed a number of polygonal portions, approach
 ing more or less to circles, but often perfectly circular, and ex
 hibiting the black cross with coloured sectors and rings analo
 gous to those produced by uniaxal crystals.         This observation,
 which was made with decomposed glass given me forty years
 ago by the late Marquis of Northampton, was communicated to
 the British Association at Glasgow in 1855 ; but at that time        I
 regarded the black cross and its accompanying tints, as shown
 in the drawings on the table, as produced by the refraction and
 polarization    in different azimuths of the light transmitted
 through the spherical shells, like a group of watch-glasses, of
 which the circular portions were composed. The light surround
 ing the black cross was so highly coloured with the colours of
 the thin plates which composed the <U+FB01>lm of glass, that I failed in
 every attempt to analyse it.       After examining, however, many
 hundreds of these <U+FB01>lms from the new specimens which            I have
 mentioned,    I  succeeded in <U+FB01>nding a few in which there were no
 such colours, and which
                                                 Jr
 enabled me to arrive at
 results that could not                  B
 havebeenobtained from
 the <U+FB01>nest and the thin
 nest plates of glass arti-                        B   G  H
  <U+FB01>cially produced.                                                 N
     These results will be     “1
 understood from the an
 nexed diagram,in which
  M N is a thin plate and
  AB a ray of common
 light incident perpen-                           M

dicularly at B, and emerging at C in the direction . C D. As a
portion of the ray B C is re<U+FB02>ected at C, and again re<U+FB02>ected at
B and transmitted at C, the pencil CD will consist of two di
stinct portions, one of which has been twice refracted, and the
other and much feebler portion twice re<U+FB02>ected.          As neither of
these portions are polarized, no physical change is produced by
their combination, unless when the plate MN is so extremely
thin as to produce the colours of thin plates by the interference
of the re<U+FB02>ected with the refracted portions.
   When a ray RB is incident obliquely at B, it suffers refrac
tion at B and E, and the emergent pencil E F contains a portion
of light polarized by refraction.      This ray, in passing through
other plates or <U+FB01>lms parallel to M N, is at last completely polar
ized in one plane, having grown feebler in intensity by the
abstraction of the light re<U+FB02>ected at the two surfaces of each
plate.
   The portion of the refracted pencil B E which is re<U+FB02>ected at
E  and G, and a portion of it polarized, emerges at K as a pen
cil K L, partly polarized by retlcxion.       A portion of G K is
again re<U+FB02>ected at K and H, and emerges at P as a pencil P S,
more polarized by re<U+FB01>cxion than K L.          Hence the principal or
refracted pencil E F is combined with the pencils K L, P S (and
others by re<U+FB01>exions at P, &c.), polarized in an opposite plane, so
that with a certain number of plates, varying with the angle of
incidence, the emergent pencil E F, KL, and PS consists of
two oppositely-polarized portions of light approximately equal.
   When polarized light is incident upon a pile of these thin and
colourless <U+FB01>lms, and subsequently analysed, it exhibits all the
properties of a plate cut perpendicularly          to the axis of a
uniaxal crystal.    The line A D corresponds with the axis of the
crystal ; and the different azimuths in which the polarized ray
may be inclined to this axis correspond with the principal sec
tions of a uniaxal crystal.    The polarized tints have the same
value in every azimuth at the same angle of incidence, and
therefore form rings which, when cr0ssed with plates of sulphate
of lime, descend in Newton’s Scale like the tints of negative
uniaxal crystals.
   Out of hundreds of specimens now on the table,       I have found
a few so colourless and so perfect as to produce, at different inci
dences, all the polarized tints or' rings up to the blue of the
second order of Newton’s Scale.         These colours are so pure,
and so regularly developed by the inclination of the plate, that
the most skilful observer could not fail to pronounce it to be a
portion of a doubly refracting crystal.
   The production of the leading phenomena of doubly refracting
crystals, namely, two oppositely polarized pencils, and the system

    Absorption and Radiation   of Heat  by Gases and Vapours.   273
of coloured rings by the interference of these pencils, is certainly
one of the most remarkable facts in physical optics; and, in a
theoretical point of view, no less remarkable is the fact that one
of the interfering portions is a fasciculus of pencils returned into
the refracted beam by different routes, and having different
origins.
     Owing to the extreme thinn08s of the combined <U+FB01>lms, we
cannot, as with thick plates of uniaxal crystals, see at once the
black cross and its attendant rings ; but in numerous specimens
                                    I
of decomposed glass to which have already referred, the <U+FB01>lms
are spherical shells of different diameters and thicknesses, and
exhibit the black cross with the greatest sharpness and beaut .
 In many specimens these circular combinations are perfectly
 colourless, and the colours of the four luminous sectors which
 embrace the black cross rise only to the white of the <U+FB01>rst order.
     “Then the <U+FB01>lms are so thin as to give the colours of thin
 plates, the colour of the luminous sectors is generally the same
 as that of the <U+FB01>lm in which the circular portions occur, and the
 rings or bands which surround them have a very peculiar cha
 racter, owing to the manner in which the spherical shells are
joined to the <U+FB01>lms which compose the plate.
     How far these results may lead to new views of the struc
 ture which produces double refraction, it would be unpro<U+FB01>table
 to inquire in the present state of our knowledge of the atomical
 constitution of transparent bodies.

  hydrogen, and nitrous oxide.        The action of these gases is so
  much feebler than that of any of the vapours referred to in the
  last section, that, in examining the relationship between absorp
  tion and density, the measures used with the vapours were aban
  doned, and the quantities of gas admitted were measured by the
  depression of the mercurial gauge.

    The proportion here holds good up to a tension of 2'5 inches,
when the deviation from it commences and gradually augments.
    Though these measurements were made with all possible care,
I   should like to repeat them. Dense fumes issued from the
cylinders of the air-pump on exhausting the tube of this gas, and
I am not at present able to state with con<U+FB01>dence that a trace of
such in a very diffuse form within the tube did not interfere with
the purity of the results.

    Here the divergence from proportionality makes itself mani
fest from the commencement.
    I promised at the <U+FB01>rst page of this memoir to allude to the
results of Dr. Franz, and I will now do so. With a tube 3 feet
long and blackened within, an absorption of 3'54 per cent. by
 atmoapheric air was observed in his experiments.                  In my expe
riments, however, with a tube 4 feet long and polished within,
which makes the distance traversed by the re<U+FB02>ected rays more
than 4 feet, the absorption is only one-tenth of the above amount.
In the experiments of Dr. Franz, carbonic acid appears as a
feebler absorber than oxygen.            According to my experiments, for
small quantities the absorptive power of the former is about 150
times that of the latter; and for atmospheric tensions, carbonic
 acid probably absorbs nearly 100 times as much as oxygen.
    The differences between Dr. Franz and myself admit, perhaps,
 of the following explanation.           His source of heat was an argand
 lamp,  and   the   ends   of  his experimental     tube were stopped with
 plates  of glass.     Now     Melloni   has shown    that fully 61 per cent.
 of the heat-rays emanating from a Locatelli lamp are absorbed
 by a plate of glass one-tenth of an inch in thickness.               Hence in
 all probability the greater portion of the rays issuing from the
 lamp of Dr. Franz was expended in heating the two glass ends
 of his experimental tube.           These ends thus became secondary
 sources of heat which radiated against his pile.                 On admitting
 air into the tube, the partial ~withdrawal by conduction and con

 276                Prof. Tyndall   on the   Absorption and
 vcction of the heat of the glass plates would produce an effect
 exactly the same as that of true absorption.             By allowing the
 air in my tube to come into contact with the radiating plate,             I
 have often obtained a de<U+FB02>ection of twenty or thirty degrees,—the
  effect being due to the cooling of the plate, and not to absorp
  tion. It is also certain that had          I used heat from a luminous
 source,     I  should have found the'absorption of 0'33 per cent.
 considerably diminished.
            I
      § 8. have now to refer brie<U+FB02>y to a point of considerableinter
  est as regards the effect of our atmosphere on solar and terres
  trial heat. In examining the separate e<U+FB01>'ccts of the air, carbonic
 acid, and aqueous vapour of the atmosphere, on the 20th of last
  November, the following results were obtained :—
      Air sent through the system of drying-tubes and through the
 caustic-potash tube produced an absorption of about               .  .   1.
      Air direct from the laboratory, containing therefore its car
 bonic acid* and aqueous vapour, produced an absorption of . l5.
      Dcducting the effect of the gaseous acids, it was found that
 the quantity of aqueous vapour diffused through the atmosphere
 on the day in question, produced an absorption at least equal
 to thirteen times that of the atmosphere itself.
      It is my intention to repeat and extend these experiments on
 a future occasionT; but even at present conclusions               of great
 importance may be drawn from them.               It is exceedingly proba
 ble that the absorption of the solar rays by the atmosphere, as
 established by M. Pouillet, is mainly due to the watery vapour
 contained in the air.       The vast difference between the tempera
 ture of the sun at midday and in the evening, is also probably
 due in the main to that comparatively shallow stratum of aqueous
 vapour which lies close to the earth.            At noon the depth of it
 pierced by the sunbeams is very small; in the evening very
 great in comparison.
     The intense heat of the sun’s direct rays on high mountains is
 not,   I  believe, due to his beams having to penetrate only a small
 depth of air, but to the comparative absence of aqueous vapour
at tl10se great elevations.
     But this aqueous vapour, which exercises such a destructive
action on the obscure rays, is comparatively transparent to the
rays of light.       Hence the differential action, as regards the heat
coming from the sun to the earth and that radiated from the
earth into space, is vastly augmented by the aqueous vapour of
the atmosphere.
    “ And a portion of sulphurous       acid produced by the two gas-lamps
used to heat the cubes.
    1' The peculiarities of the locality in which this experiment was made
render its repetition under other circumstances necessary.

                   Radiation of Heat                by Gases and Vapours.   277
        De Saussure, Fourier, M. Pouillet, and Mr. Hopkins regard
     this interception of the terrestrial rays as exercising the most
     important in<U+FB02>uence on climate.      Now      as the above experi
                                                              if,
     ments indicate, the chief in<U+FB02>uence be exercised       the aqueous by
     vapour, every   variation  of  this constituent  must produce           a
     change of climate.     Similar remarks would apply to the car
     bonic acid diffused through the air, while an almost inappre
     ciable admixture of any of the hydrocarbon vapours would pro
     duce great effects on the terrestrial rays and produce correspond
     ing changes of climate.           It
                                       not, therefore, necessary to assume
                                               is
     alterations in the density and height of the atmosphere to account
     for different amounts of heat being preserved to the earth at dif-~
     ferent times;   a   slight change in its variable constituents would
     suf<U+FB01>ce for this.    Such changes in fact may have produced all the
_I
     mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal.
      However this may be, the facts above cited remain; they constitute
     true causes, the extent alone of the operation remaining doubtful.
         The measurements recorded in the foregoing pages consti
     tute only a   fraction of those actually made; but they ful<U+FB01>l the
      object of the present portion of the inquiry.     They establish the
      existence of enormous differences among colourless gases and
      vapours as to their action upon radiant heat; and the             also
      show that, when the quantities are suf<U+FB01>ciently small, the a<U+FB02>sorp

      to the density.
         These experiments furnish us with purer cases of molecular
      action than have been hitherto attained in experiments of this
      nature.    In both solids and liquids the cohesion of the particles
     is  implicated; they mutually control and limit each other.          A
      certain action, over and above that which belongs to them sepa
      rately, comes into play and embarrasses our conceptions.          But
      in the cases above recorded the molecules are perfectly free, and
      we <U+FB01>x upon them individually the effects which the experiments
      exhibit; thus the mind’s eye        directed more <U+FB01>rmly than ever

                         a
      heat.    He found the radiation from his alcohol lamp greatly
       augmented   by plunging     spiral of platinum wire into the <U+FB02>ame.

278              Prof. Tyndall  on the  Absorption and
tion, while when      the wire was withdrawn no trace of radiant
heat could    be  detected  by his apparatus.      He concluded from
this experiment that air possesses the power of radiation in so
feeble a degree, that our best thermoscopic instruments fail to
detect this power*.
    These are the only experiments hitherto published upon this
subject; and I have now to record these which have been made
in connexion with the present inquiry. The pile furnished with
its conical re<U+FB02>ector was placed upon a stand, with a screen of
polished tin in front of it.    An alcohol lamp was placed behind
the screen so that its <U+FB02>ame was entirely hidden by the latter;
on rising above the screen, the gaseous column radiated its heat
against the pile and produced a considerable de<U+FB02>ection.            The
same effect    was  produced   when   a  candle  or an  ordinary jet of
 gas was substituted for the alcohol lamp.
    The heated products of combustion acted on the pile in the
 above experiments, but the radiation from pure air was easily
 demonstrated by placing a heated iron spatula or metal sphere
 behind the screen.        A de<U+FB02>ection was thus obtained which,
 when the spatula was raised to a red heat, amounted to more
 than sixty degrees. This action was due solely to the radiation
 of the air; no radiation from the spatula to the pile was possible,
 and no portion of the heated air itself approached the pile so as
 to communicate its warmth by contact to the latter.             These
 effects are so easily produced that I am at a loss to account for the
 inability of so excellent an experimenter as Melloni to obtain them.
     My next care was to examine whether di<U+FB01>‘erent gases possessed
 different powers of radiation ; and for this purpose the following
 arrangement was devised. P (<U+FB01>g. 1) represents the thermo-electric
 pile with its two conical re<U+FB02>ectors ; S is a double screen of po
 lished tin; A is an argand burner consisting of two concentric
 rings perforated with ori<U+FB01>ces for the escape of the gas; C is a
 heated copper ball ; the tube    it  leads to a gas-holder containing
 the gas to be examined.        When the ball C is placed on the
 argand burner, it of course heats the air in contact with it ; an
 ascending current is established, which acts on the pile as in
 the experiments      last described.     It was found necessary to
 neutralize this radiation from the heated air, and for this pur
 pose a large Leslie’s cube L, <U+FB01>lled with water a few degrees
 above the temperature of the air, was allowed to act on the op
 posite face of the pile.
     When the needle was thus brought to zero, the cock of the
 gas-holder was turned on; the gas passed through the burner,
 came into contact with the ball, and ascended afterwards in a
 heated column in front of the pile.        The galvanometer was now

observed, and the     limit of the  are through which its needle was
urged was noted.        It is needless to remark that the ball was
entirely hidden by the screen from the thermo-electric pile,
and that, even were this not the case, the mode of neutraliza
tion adopted would still give us the pure action of the gas.
    The results of the experiments are given in the following
Table, the <U+FB01>gure appended to the name of each gas marking

latter urged the needle of the galvanometer*:—

   The radiation from air, it will be remembered, was neutralized
by the large Leslie’s cube, and hence the 0° attached to it merely
denotes that the propulsion of air from the gas-holder through
the argand burner did not augment the effect.           Oxygen, hydro
  . l  have also rendered these experiments on radiation visible to a large
audience.   They may be readily introduced in lectures on radiant heat.

280             Prof. Tyndall   on the   Absorption and
gen, and nitrogen, sent in a similar manner over the ball, were
equally ineffective.    The other gases, however, not only exhibit a
marked action, but also marked differences of action.            Their
radiative powers follow precisely the same order as their powers
of absorption.     In fact, the de<U+FB02>ections actually produced by
their respective absorptions at 5 inches tension are as follow :—

     It would  be easy to give    these experiments a more elegant
form, and to arrive at greater accuracy, which I intend to do on
a future occasion; but my object now is simply to establish the
general order of their radiative powers.         An interesting way of
exhibiting    both  radiation and    absorption is as follows z—W'hen
the polished face of a Leslie’s cube is turned towards a thermo
electric pile the etfect produced is inconsiderable,          but it is
 greatly augmented when a coat of varnish is laid upon the po
 lished surface. Instead of the coat of varnish, a <U+FB01>lm of gas may
 be made use of.      Such a cube, containing boiling water, had its
 polished face turned towards the pile, and its effect on the gal
 vanometer neutralized in the usual manner.           The needle being
 at 0°, a <U+FB01>lm of ole<U+FB01>ant gas, issuing from a narrow slit, was
 passed over the metal. The increase of radiation produced a de
 <U+FB02>ection of 45°.     When the gas was cut off, the needle returned
 accurately to 0°.
     The absorption by a <U+FB01>lm may be shown by <U+FB01>lling the cube
 with cold water, but not so cold as to produce the precipitation
 of the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere.           A gilt copper ball,
 cooled in a freezing mixture, was placed in front of the pile, and
  its effect was neutralized by presenting a beaker containing a
 little iced water to the opposite face of the pile.       A <U+FB01>lm of ole
  <U+FB01>ant gas was sent over the ball, but the consequent deflection
  proved that the absorption, instead of being greater, was less
  than before. The ball, in fact, had been coated by a crust of ice,
  which is one of the best absorbers of radiant heat. The ole<U+FB01>ant
  gas, being warmer than the ice, partially neutralized its absorp
  tion. \Vhen, however, the temperature of the ball was only a
  few degrees 10wer than that of the atmosphere, and its surface
  quite dry, the <U+FB01>lm of gas was found to act as a <U+FB01>lm of varnish ;
  it augmented the absorption.

               Radiation   of Heat   by Gases and Vapours.             281
   A remarkable effect, which contributed at <U+FB01>rst to the com
plexity of the experiments, can now be explained. Conceive the
experimental tube exhausted and the needle at zero ; conceive a
small quantity of alcohol or ether vapour admitted; it cuts off a
portion of the heat from one source, and the opposite source
triumphs.      Let the consequent de<U+FB02>ection be 45°.      Ifdry air be
now admitted till the tube is <U+FB01>lled, its effect of course will be
slightly to augment the absorption and make the above de<U+FB02>ec
tion greater.     But the following action is really observed :—
when the air <U+FB01>rst enters, the needle, instead of ascending, de
scends ; it falls to 26°, as if a portion of the heat originally cut
off had been restored. At 26°, however, the needle stops, turns,
moves quickly upwards, and takes up a permanent position a
little higher than 45°.       Let the tube now be exhausted, the
withdrawal of the mixed air and vapour ought of course to
restore the equilibrium with which we started; but the follow
ing effects are observed :—When the exhaustion commences, the
needle moves upwards from 45° to 54°; it then halts, turns, and
descends speedily to 0°, where it permanently remains.
    After many trials to account for the anomaly,            I
                                                           proceeded
thusz—A thermo-eleetric couple was soldered to the external
surface of the experimental tube, and its ends connected with a
galvanometer.      When air was admitted, a deflection was pro
duced,   which   showed   that the air, on entering the vacuum, was
heated.      On exhausting, the needle was also deflected, showing
that the interior of the tube was chilled. These are indeed
known effects; but    I  was desirous to make myself perfectly sure
of them.   I    subsequently had the tube perforated and thermo
 meters screwed into it air-tight.      On <U+FB01>lling the tube the ther
 mometric columns rose, on exhausting it they sank, the range
 between the maximum and minimum amounting in the case of
 air to 5° Fahr.
     Hence the following explanation of the above singular effects.
 The absorptive power of the vapour referred to is very great, and
 its radiative power is equally so. The heat generated by the air
 on its entrance is communicated         to the vapour, which thus
 becomes    a temporary source   of radiant heat, and diminishes the
 de<U+FB02>ection produced in the <U+FB01>rst instance by its presence.         The
 reverse occurs when the tube is exhausted; the vapour is chilled,
 its great absorptive action on the heat radiated from the adjacent
 face of the pile comes more into play, and the original effect is
 augmented.      In both cases, however, the action is transient;
 the vapour soon loses the heat communicated to              it,
                                                            and soon
gains the heat which       ithas lost, and matters then take their
normal course.

282'             Prof. Tyndall        on the   Absorption and
Conduction.-—Notwithstanding the great accessions of late years
to our knowledge of the nature of heat, we are as yet,  believe,   I
quite ignorant of the atomic conditions on which radiation,
absorption,     and    conduction         depend.   What are the speci<U+FB01>c
qualities which cause one body to radiate copiously and another
feebly? Why, on theoretic grounds, must the equivalence of
radiation and absorption exist? Why should a highly diather
manous body, as shown by Mr. Balfour Stewart, be a bad radi
ator, and an adiathermanous body a good radiator? How is heat
conducted? and what is the strict physical meaning of good
conduction and bad conduction? Why should good conductors
be, in general, bad radiators, and bad conductors good radia
tors? These, and other questions, referring to facts more or less
established, have still to receive their complete answers.  It is
less with a hope of furnishing such than of shadowing forth the
possibility of uniting these various effects by a common bond,
       I
that submit the following re<U+FB02>ections to the notice of the Royal
Society.
    In the experiments recorded in the foregoing pages, we have
dealt with free atoms, both simple and compound, and it has
been found that in all cases absorption takes place.    The mean
ing of this, according to the dynamical theory of heat, is that no
 atom is capable of existing in vibrating ether without accepting
a portion of its motion.    We may, if we wish, imagine a certain
roughness   of the surface  of  the atoms which enables the ether
to bite them and carry   the   atom along with it.  But no matter
what the quality may be which enables any atom to accept mo
tion from the agitated ether, the same quality must enable it to
impart motion to still ether when it is plunged in the latter and
agitated.   It is only necessary to imagine the case of a body
immersed in water to see that this must be the case.     There is a
polarity here as rigid as that of magnetism. From the existence
of absorption,'wc may on theoretic grounds infallibly infer a
capacity for radiation; from the existence of radiation, we may
with equal certainty infer a capacity for absorption ; and each of
them must be regarded as the measure of the other*.
   This reasoning, founded simply on the mechanical relations
of the ether and the atoms immersed in              it,
                                                completely veri<U+FB01>ed
                                                          is
by experiment.      Great di<U+FB01>crences have been shown to exist
among gases as to their powers of absorption, and precisely
similar differences as regards their powers of radiation. But
what speci<U+FB01>c property           which makes one free molecule a
                                is   it
strong  absorber,   while another  offers scarcely any impediment
to the passage of radiant heat?      think the experiments throw
                                          I
  "      was written long before Kirrshlio<U+FB01>’s admirable
    This                                                        papers on the
relation of emission   to   absorption were known to me.

               Radiation ofHeal by Gases and 'Vapours.                   288
some light upon this question.          If we inspect the results above
recorded, we shall <U+FB01>nd that the elementary gases hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, and the mixture atmospheric air, possess ab~
sorptive and radiative powers beyond comparison less than those
'of the compound gases.         Uniting the atomic theory with the
 conception   of  an  ether,  this  result appears to be exactly what
 ought to be expected.        Taking Dalton’s idca of an elementary
 body as a single sphere, and supposing such a sphere to be set
 in motion in still ether, or placed without motion in moving
 ether, the communication of motion by the atom in the <U+FB01>rst
 instance, and the acceptance of it in the second, must be less
 than when a number of such atoms are grouped together and
 move as a system.       Thus we see that hydrogen and nitrogen,
 which, when mixed together, produce a small effect, when chemi
 cally united to form ammonia, produce an enormous effect.
 Thus oxygen and hydrogen, which, when mixed in their elect
 trolytic proportions, show a scarcely sensible action, when chemif
 cally combined to form aqueous vapour exert a powerful action.
  So also with oxygen and nitrogen, which, when mixed, as in our
 atmosphere, both absorb and radiate feebly, when united to form
  oscillating systems, as in nitrous oxide, have their powers vastly
  augmented.     Pure atmospheric air, of 5 inches tension, does not
  effect an absorption equivalent to more than the one-<U+FB01>fth of
  a degree, while nitrous oxide of the same tension effects an
  absorption equivalent to <U+FB01>fty-one such degrees.           Hence the ab
  sorption by  nitrous  oxide  at  this tension  is  about  250   times that
  of air. N0 fact    in chemistry    carries the   same   conviction   to to
  mind, that air is a mixture and not a compound, as that just cit .
  In like manner, the absorption by carbonic oxide of this tension
  is nearly 100 times that of oxygen alone; the absorption b
  carbonic acid is about 150 times that of oxygen ; while the ab
  sorption by ole<U+FB01>ant gas of this tension is 1000 times that of its
  constituent hydrogen.        Even the enormous action last men
  tioned is surpassed by the vapours of many of the volatile
  liquids, in which the atomic groups are known to attain their
  highest degree of complexity.
      I have hitherto limited myself to the consideration,           that the
   compound    molecules   present   broad   sides  to the ether,   while the
-
   simple atoms with which we have operated do not,—that in con
   sequence of these differences the ether must swell into billows
   when the former are moved, while it merely trembles into rip
   ples when the latter are agitated,—that, in the interception of
   motion also, the former, other things being equal, must be far
   more in<U+FB02>uential than the latter; but another important consi
   deration remains.      All the gases and vapours whose deport
   mcnt we have examined are transparent to light ,' that is to say,

284,           .   .Prof. Tyndall on   the   Absorption and
the waves of the visible spectrum pass among them without sen
sible absorption.   Hence it is plain that their absorptive power
depends on the periodicity of the undulations which strike them.
At this point the present inquiry connects itself with the experi
ments of Niepce, the observation of Foucault, the surmises of
Angstrom, Stokes, and Thomson, and those splendid researches
of Kirchho<U+FB02>' and Bunsen which so immeasurably extend our
experimental   range.  By Kirchhoff it has been conclusively
shown that every atom absorbs in a special degree these waves
which are synchronous with its own periods of vibration. Now,
besides presenting broader sides to the ether, the association of
simple atoms to form groups must, as a general rule, render
their motions through the ether more sluggish, and tend to
bring the periods of oscillation into isochronism with the slow
undulations ot' obscure heat, thus enabling the molecules to
 absorb more effectually such rays as have been made use of in
 our experiments.
    Let me here state brie<U+FB02>y the grounds which induce me to
 conclude that an agreement in period alone is not suf<U+FB01>cient to
 cause pOWerful absorption and radiation—that in addition to
 this the molecules must be so constituted as to furnish points
 d’appui to the ether. The heat of contact is accepted with
 extreme freedom by rock-salt, but a plate of the substance once
 heated requires a great length of time to cool.     This surprised
 me when   I  <U+FB01>rst noticed it. But the effect is explained by the
 experiments of Mr. Balfour Stewart, by which it is proved that
 the radiative power of heated rock~salt is extremely feeble.
 Periodicity can have no in<U+FB02>uence here, for the ether is ca able
 of accepting and transmitting impulses of all periods; an the
 fact that rock-salt requires more time to cool than alum, simply
 proves that the molecules of the former glide through the ether
 with comparatively small resistance, and thus continue moving
 for a longer time; while those of the latter resenting broad
 sides to the ether, speedily communicate to it t e motion which
 we call heat.    This power of gliding through still ether pos
 sessed by the rock-salt molecules, must of course enable the
 moving ether to glide round them, and no coincidence of period
       I
 could, think, make such a body a powerful absorber.
    Many chemists,       I
                        believe, are disposed to reject the idea of
 an atom, and to adhere to that of equivalent proportions merely.
“They <U+FB01>gure the act of combination as a kind of interpenetration
 of one substance by another. But this is a mere masking of
 the fundamental phenomenon.        The value of the atomic theory
 consists in its furnishing the physical explanation of the law of
'equivalents: assuming the one, the other follows ; and assuming
 the act of chemical union as Dalton <U+FB01>gured              it,
                                                     we see that it

               Radiation ofHeal by Gases and Vapours.                   285
blends harmoniously with the perfectly independent              conception
of an ether, and enables us to reduce the phenomena of radia
tion and absorption to the simplest mechanical principles.
    Considerations     similar to the above may,      I  think, he applied
to the phenomena of conduction.           In the Philosophical Magazine
for August 1853,I have described an instrument used in exami
ning the transmission of heat through cubes of wood and other
substances.      When engaged with this instrument,             I had also
cubes of various crystals prepared, and determined with it their
powers of conduction.           With one exception,     I  found that the
conductivity augmented with the diathermaney.                The exception
was furnished by a cube of very perfect rock-crystal, which con
ducted slightly better than my cube of rock-salt. _The latter,
however, had a very high conductive power; in fact rock-salt,
calcareous spar, glass, selenitc, and alum stood in my experi
ments, as regards conductivity, exactly in their order of diather'
inancy in the experiments of Melloni.            I have already adduced
considerations which show that the molecules of rock-salt glide
with facility through the ether; but the ease of motion which
these molecules enjo          must facilitate their mutual collision.
Their motion, instead of being expended on the ether which
exists between them ,and communicated by it to the external ether,
is in great part transferred directly from particle to particle, or
in other words, is freely conducted.         When a molecule of alum,
on the contrary, approaches a neighbour molecule, it produces a
swell in the intervening ether, which swell is in part transmitted,
not to the molecules, but to the general ether of space, and thus
lost as regards conduction.           This lateral waste prevents the
motion from penetrating the alum to any great extent, and the
 substance is what we call a bad conductor*.
    Such -c0nsiderations        as these could hardly :occur without
carrying the mind to the kindred question of electric conduc
 tion ; but the speculations have been pursued suf<U+FB01>ciently far for
the present, and must now abide the judgment of those com
petent to decide whether they are the mere emanations of fancy,
 or a fair application of principles which are acknowledged to be
 secure.
    The present paper,        I   may remark, embraces only the <U+FB01>rst
 section of these researches.
    ‘  In the above considerations regarding conduction.      I have limited
 myself to the illustration furnished by two compound bodies ; but the ele
 mentary atoms also differ among themselves as regards their powers of
 accepting motion from the ether and of communicating motion to it.
 should infer, for example, that the atoms of latinum encounter more
 resistance in moving throu h the ether than he atoms of silver.         Itis
 needless to say that the p lysieal texture of a substance also‘has a great
in<U+FB02>uence.

 bubble of oil more than 12 centimetres in diameter,          in<U+FB02>ating    by
it  with the same alcoholic mixture, just as one obtains in air                        a

    It must be remembered, with regard to these <U+FB01>lms of oil,
 that in the experiment in my First Series where         ring, of oila                 is
 formed, this ring remains at <U+FB01>rst united to the central apparatus
 by thin <U+FB01>lm; and starting with that fact,

 of liquid <U+FB01>lms removed from the action of gravity,               shall    I

 Besides,   it is possible, withOut having recourse to mathematical
  analysis, suf<U+FB01>ciently to account for this identity. Let me repeat,
 for this purposc, a principle on which   I  have many times dwelt in
 the preceding series.       When a surface ful<U+FB01>ls the general condi
 tion of equilibrium, it is indi<U+FB01>'ercnt whether the liquid be on one
 side or on the other of this surface; in other words, to each
 <U+FB01>gure in a state of equilibrium, which is in relief, corresponds
 a <U+FB01>gure in a state of equilibrium, identical with the same, only
 in depression.     Now, the two faces of a liquid <U+FB01>lm, on account
 of the thinness of the latter, being capable of being considered
 as though they were two identical surfaces, the one in relief and
 the other depressed with regard to the liquid which forms the
 <U+FB01>lm, it follows, from the principle in question, that if one of these
 two faces constitutes a surface of equilibrium, it is the same with
 the other face, and that thus equilibrium exists throughout the
 entire <U+FB01>lm.
    Suppose, however, it was possible to form in air liquid <U+FB01>lms
 devoid of weight; these <U+FB01>lms would necessarily take the same
 form as the <U+FB01>lms of oil formed in the alcoholic mixture. Now
 liquid <U+FB01>lms formed in air (<U+FB01>lms of soapy water, for example)
 are so thin that the action of gravity upon them can generally
 be regarded as inappreeiable in comparison with that of mole
 cular forces; we should therefore obtain in air, with <U+FB01>lms of
 soapy water or of an analogous liquid, the same <U+FB01>gures in a
 state of equilibrium as with <U+FB01>lms of oil in the alcoholic mixture,
 and consequently, after what       I have said above, <U+FB01>gures which
 would belong to a full liquid mass devoid of weight. Therein
 consists the process which     I have mentioned.
    Thus we arrive at the curious result, that, with a liquid acted
upon by gravity and in a state of repose, one can produce on a.
large scale all forms of equilibrium which belong to a liquid
mass without weight and likewise at rest.
    Soap-bubbles offer the <U+FB01>rst example for the employment of
the process under consideration; <U+FB02>oating in air, they are sphe
rical, just as a full liquid mass would be if devoid of weight and
freed from all adhesion.                  .
    The <U+FB01>lms, however, which are obtained from common solution
of soap have but a very short existence, unless they be in a
close vessel; a soap-bubble of one decimetrc diameter, formed
in the open air of a room, rarely lasts two minutes; it was
therefore essential to <U+FB01>nd out some better liquid; and         I have
been happy enough to discover one which furnishes in the open
air, whilst preserving its liquid nature, <U+FB01>lms of great durability.
This liquid is formed by mixing, in proper proportions, glycerine,
water, and soap.       A glycerine which seems very pure and very
concentrated can be easily procured at no great cost in London,
at  Mr. Bolton’s, 146 Holborn Bars, for instance.       I shall point

288-          M.   I.   Plategm on the Figures     of Equilibrium
out in a note at the end of the memoir, the proper way to obtain
suf<U+FB01>ciently good results with the ordinary glycerine of com
merce.
   The mixture must be prepared in summer, and when the tem
perature out-of-doors is at least 19" Cent.     Dissolve at a gentle
heat one part by weight of Marseilles soap, previously cut into
thin shavings, in 40 parts of distilled water; and when the solu-,
tion is cold, <U+FB01>lter it. That done, carefully mix in a <U+FB02>ask by
violent and continual agitation, 2 vols. of glycerinc with 3 vols.
of the above-mentioned solution, and then allow it to stand. The
mixture,limpid at the time of itsformation,bcgins aftersome hours
to grow turbid ; a slight white precipitate is produced, which rises
with great slowness, and after some days forms a distinct layer
at the top of the liquid; the limpid portion is then collected by
means of a siphon, which draws off by a lateral tube, and the
preparation    is at an end.
   The liquid thus obtained, and which              I
                                                   name glyceric liquid,
gives  <U+FB01>lms of  great durability;    for  instance,  if with this liquid,
by means of a common clay pipe, a bubble 1 decimctre in
diameter be in<U+FB02>ated, and then placed in the open air of a room
upon a ring of iron wire 4 centimetres in diameter and
previously moistened with the same liquid, this bubble, provided
it is perfectly at rest, will remain entire for three hours.
    The glyceric liquid can be preserved about a year, after which
time it rapidly decomposes.           Ihave not observed any disen
gagement    of gas 3 however,   as the  liquid is of an organic nature,
it Would not be unlikely that such might be produced sometimes ;
and it would be prudent, to prevent a possible explosion, to
   gnly
       close the <U+FB02>ask with            cork which does not <U+FB01>t very
                                      a
  rmly.
    Just as the <U+FB01>lms of soapy water last very much longer in                a
 closed vessel than in the open air, the endurance of the <U+FB01>lms of
 glyceric liquid, already so great in the open air, becomes still
 much more considerable when these <U+FB01>lms are enclosed in vessel,        a
 especially   ifcertain precautions are taken.         shall quote an
                                                          I
 example of this further on.
     Having thus obtained       liquid easily furnishing <U+FB01>lms both
                                  a
 large and very durable,     employ
                              I         in order to produce
                                          it                    means  by
 of them all the <U+FB01>gures, in state of equilibrium, of revolution. In
                                a
 order not to give this analysis too great length, shall limit myself
                                                        I
 here to succinctly describing the formation of the cylinder.
     For this purpose, use     made of an apparatus of two rings of
                                is
 iron wire     7centimetres in diameter, similar to those men
 tioned   by me in the preceding series,‘ that       to say, the lower
                                                         is
  ring on tripod, and the upper ring, supported
          a                                                   by
                                                            fork, <U+FB01>xed
                                                                   a
  into the two extremities of its diameter; the end of this fork            is
  attached to  asupport, <U+FB01>xed in such       manner that the ring can
                                               a

                           of a Liquid Mass     devoid        of Weiyhh                        289
be raised or lowered by a gentle movement. Place the <U+FB01>rst ring
upon its stand on the table, sustain the second at a convenient
height over              it,
                  and well moisten both with the glyceric liquid;
then in<U+FB02>ate      bubble of about 10 centimetres diameter, place
                     a                                                                           it
upon the lower ring and withdraw the pipe; new lower the upper
ring until comes in contact with the bubble, which immediately
                it
attaches itself to it; at last gradually raise this ring, and the
bubble, which thus drawn out loses more and more its spherical
curvature,      converted,
                    is               by
                                certain separation of the rings, into
                                       a
a perfectly regular cylinder, having convex bases like the full
cylinders of oil.
  A   rather larger diameter can be given to the bubble; but
when      it too large, the cylindrical form
               is                                no longer obtained,
                                                                is
either because the cylinder which         desired to obtain exceeds
its limit of stability*, or because,             if it
                                                     it is
                                           be still within this limit,
it  begins to approach it; in this last case, in fact, the <U+FB01>gure
producing forces becoming very little intense, the small weight
of the <U+FB01>lm exerts an appreciable in<U+FB02>uence, and the <U+FB01>gure appears
more or less swollen at the lower half, and compressed at the
upper half. The tallest ' regular cylinder which can be formed
with the rings, before pointed out, has             height of about  a
 17 centimetres. Let us state in this place, that, for the complete
 success of experiments of this kind, the rings should have under
 gone     little preparation: when they leave the hands of the
           a
 workman they should be slightly oxidized on their surface by
 dipping them for two minutes into nitric acid diluted with four
 times its volume of water; afterwards wash them in pure water.
    In the memoir will be found the way to produce, in the
 laminated condition as well, the other forms of equilibrium of
 revolution, namely, those to which      have given-{- the names of
                                                 I
calenoids, onduloids, and nodoids.
   These experiments are very curious; there       peculiar charm    is   a
in the contemplation of these <U+FB01>gures, so slender, almost reduced
to mathematical surfaces, which make their appearance tinted
with the most brilliant colours, and which, in spite of their ex
treme frailness, endure for such   time. These same experiments
                                               a
can be readily performed, and in the most convenient manner.
 I   now pass on to another application of my new process.
Procure      collection of frames of iron wire, each one of which
               a
exhibits all the edges of a polyhedron—for example, of cube,                         a               3
regular octahedron, of prisms with triangular, pentagonal, and
other bases. Each of these frames     to be <U+FB01>xed like the upper

ring in the before-mentioned experiment,        fork attached to  by     a
two of its edges; they ought also to be oxidized      nitric acid.              by

 290           M.   J.   Plateau on       the   Figures of Equilibrium
 In    order to give an idea of the most convenient dimensions for
  this apparatus,    I  will just say that the edges of my cubical frame
  are 7 centimetres in length, and that. the iron wire, of which it
  is formed, is a little less than 1 millimetre in thickness.                    I
  haVc already employed similar frames in the experiments (men
  tioned in my second memoir) for the formation of liquid polyhedra.
      If  one of these frames were completely dipped (with the ex
  ception of the upper part of the fork) into the glyceric liquid
  and then withdrawn, it would be expected that the adhesion of
  this liquid to the solid frame would cause the formation of a set
 of <U+FB01>lms, occupying the interior of the frame; and this does take
 place; but a m0st remarkable thing it                     is,
                                                       that the arrangement
 of these <U+FB01>lms      is  not    matter of chance;
                                 a                                    is,
                                                             on the contrary,
                                                                 it
 perfectly    regular   and   perfectly  constant   for each  frame.     In the
 cubical frame,      for instance,    isinvariably   obtained     collectionaof
 twelve <U+FB01>lms, starting respectively from the twelve wires, and all
 converging on      a   much smaller thirteenth one of quadrangular
 form and occupying the centre of the apparatus.
     These systems of <U+FB01>lms, thus prepared in these polyhedral
 frames, have excited the admiration of all to whom               have shownI
 them; they have          a  perfect regularity; the liquid edges that
join ameng them the <U+FB01>lms of which they are composed are ex
 tremel <U+FB01>ne, and the <U+FB01>lms themselves after some time exhibit
 the ric est colours; again, the arrangement of these same <U+FB01>lms
is   regulated  by    simple and uniform laws, which            shall examine
                                                                       I
from       atheoretical point of view in the next series, and of which
here are the two principles :—                                                 _
    I.  At one and the same liquid edge never more than three <U+FB01>lms
can meet, and these same are inclined to each other at equal angles.
 7 II. When several liquid edges meet at one and the same point
in the interior of       a   stem, these edges are always four in num
                             s
ber,    and  are inclinedy   to each other, at the point in question, at
                                                                               '
     ual angles.
 I       had already obtained,             by
                                           totally different means, these
systems      of <U+FB01>lms    with   oil immersed    in the alcoholic liquid, as
will be seen in my second series; but they are far less perfect
and far less easily produced than                 by
                                               my present process.
.    We now pass on to another subject.              It    well known that
                                                                  is

                                                                            it
Mr. Henry, in an oral communication made in 1841-1 to the
American Society, has described experiments                           by
                                                             means of which
be measured        this  pressure by      the  height of the .column of

                                      a
arrived at the following result :—Let              stand for the density of

the same liquid rises in a capillary tube of   millimetre internal     l
diameter, d the diameter   of the  bubble, and lastly, let p denote
the pressure which this bubble exerts, or, more precisely speak
ing, the height of the column with which it would be in equili
brium"; then this pressure is expressed by the formula

                                          17:7
The product hp            is,
                       as can easily be shown, proportional to the
cohesion   of  the liquid; the pressure exerted          bubble upon        by   a
its enclosed air     consequently in direct ratio to the cohesion of
                        is
the liquid, and in inverse ratio to the diameter of the bubble.
I     verify my formula              by
                               the experiment with the glyceric liquid.
By means     of my apparatus, which       merely Mr. Henry’s slightly

difference of the level in the two branches of this instrument                                      is
measured       by
                means of     eathctometer; and the latter
                                     a                         likewise                  is
employed to measure the diameter of the bubble, for which pur~

smallest had    diameter of 7'55 millimetres, and the longest

22'75.    Except in the case of the two largest diameters, there
was very little difference from the general mean; and            the                           if
results are arranged in order, with the diameters increasin                                          ,

   It remains to compare the value of the product pd, thus de
duced     by
           experiment, with that which our formula gives; and

for this purpose it was necessary to determine, at the tempera~
ture of the preceding experiment, the density p and the height h
in regard to the glycerie liquid. This I have done, employing
every known precaution, and         I  have found    p:  11065 and
k=10'018 millimetres. One has consequently 2 hp=22'17, a
number that differs but little from 22'56, which experiment has
furnished me ; and the agreement appears still more satisfactory
when it is remembered that these two numbers are respectively
deduced from elements totally different.      The formula
                                    2hp
                               1'
                                  :71—
may therefore be regarded as clearly veri<U+FB01>ed by experiment.
    The accuracy of this formula requires, however, that the <U+FB01>lm
which constitutes the bubble should not have in any of its points
 a thickness less than twice the radius of appreciable molecular
attraction. In fact, the pressure exerted upon the enclosed air
is the sum of the two actions due to the curvatures of the faces
of the <U+FB01>lm ; and, on the other hand, it is known that in the ease
of a full liquid mass the capillary pressure of the liquid upon
itself emanates from all the points of a super<U+FB01>cial stratum having
for thickness the radius of activity in question. If, then, in all its
points the <U+FB01>lm has a thickness less than twice this same radius,
the super<U+FB01>cial layers of its two faces have no longer their com
plete thickness, and, the number of molecules contained in one
of these layers being thus diminished, these same layers must
necessarily exert a weaker action ; hence the sum of the latter,
that is to say the pressures on the enclosed air, must be less than
is indicated by the formula.
    I shall thence deduce a convenient method which furnishes an
approximate value for the radius of activity now under consider
ation, or at least within a limit extremely little below which this
radius is found. If, having in<U+FB02>ated a small bubble in the ori<U+FB01>ce
of the funnel of my apparatus, it is enclosed in a small glass
globe, it exhibits a remarkable phenomenon ; for, after some time,
by placing the eye on a level with its centre, one sees a large
space, perceptibly circular, coloured with a uniform tint, and sur
rounded by narrow concentric rings of other colours. One would
infer from this that the point has been reached at which the <U+FB01>lm
has thickness appreciably uniform throughout the whole extent
of the bubble, except of course the lowest part, where there is
always a small accumulation of liquid: the colours of the rings
which surround the central part evidently arise from the oblique
ness of the ra s from them to the eye.         This fact respecting
thickness has a ready been noticed by Newton, but only as oc
curring by chance, in the hemispherical bubbles of soapy water.
From the moment the bubble assumes this appearance it main

                  of 0 Liquid Mass devoid of Weight.              293
tains it till it bursts; the respective tints of the central space
and of the rings, however, vary progressively, changing in the
order of the colours of Newton’s rings, whence it follows that the
<U+FB01>lm becomes thinner and thinner but equally all over, always
 excepting the very lowest portion of the bubble.
    Now, after the <U+FB01>lm has acquired a uniform degree of thinness,
if the pressure exerted on the enclosed air experienced a diminu
tion, it would be rendered apparent by the manometer, and it
would be seen to proceed in a regular manner and in proportion
to the further weakening of the <U+FB01>lm. In this case the thick
ness of the <U+FB01>lm, when the_diminution of the pressure commenced,
could be determined by means of the colour which the central
space at that moment presented, and half of this thickness would
be the value of the radius of appreciable molecular attraction.
If, on the contrary, the pressure continued constant until the
bursting of the bubble, one would infer, from the colour of the
central space, the <U+FB01>nal thickness of the <U+FB01>lm, and the half of this
thickness would at least constitute the limit but a very little
below that in which is found the radius in question.
    I  have tried the application of this method.     By means of a
                                  I
number of precautions, which have pointed out in the memoir,
 a bubble, 2 centimetres in diameter, in<U+FB02>ated in the ori<U+FB01>ce of a
 small funnel and enclosed in a glass globe, existed for nearly
 three days, and at the time it burst it had reached the state of
 transition from yellow to white of the <U+FB01>rst order.     The levels of
 water in the manOmeter had made little oscillations during this
 period, sometimes in one direction, sometimes in another; still
 the last was indicative of an increase of pressure.     For reasons
 mentioned in the memoir, these oscillations could not be attri
 buted—at least entirely—to variations of temperature, and           I
 have thought it admissible that the continual diminution of the
 thickness of the <U+FB01>lm had not brought about any decrease of
 pressure; consequently the <U+FB01>nal thickness was most likely more
 than twice the radius of molecular attraction.
    Calculating the <U+FB01>nal thickness of the <U+FB01>lm by means of New
 ton’s numbers and the index of refraction of glyccric liquid, an
 index whose value, previously determined, was 1'377,         I  have
 found the thickness in question to be HB‘TT of a millimetre. Half
 of this quantity, or T771”? of a millimetre consequently constitutes
 the limit furnished by my experiment; but, to be on the safe
 side,  I prefer T711756.
    I  have thus arrived at a very probable conclusion, that in the
 glyceric liquid the radius of appreciable moleclIiar attraction is
 less than T<U+FB02>'mvth of a millimetre.
    I propose to continue this research in order to investigate the
 black colour, and to throw light on the question of the variations
 of the manometer.

             that the observed                                     disturbances            of the magnetic
needle, depending on the hours of solar or lunar time, follow
laws inconsistent with their being due to the direct magnetic
attraction of the sun or moon.          Hence it might be too hastily
concluded,   from   the  absence    of observed  effects following the
proper laws,   that these luminaries    are not magnetic. An inquiry
into the amount of this in<U+FB02>uence, however, shows that, though
the sun or moon were as highly magnetized as the earth, their
direct effects would be so small as to be masked by the more
powerful unknown perturbating causes which the observations
prove to be at work.

which Sdm=0*, the magnetic moment of the whole is the sum
of the magnetic moments of its parts; from which it follows that
the magnetic moments of similar bodies, if equally magnetized in
corresponding parts, are proportional to their volumes. There:
fore, as the action of the moon on our instruments varies as
     21%,   we may substitute          for the moon   a   hypothetical globe sub
tending at our instruments the same angle as the moon, and
equally magnetized bulk for bulk.      If, then, the moon be as
magnetic as the earth, its maximum effect will equal that of                           a
globe one metre in diameter, of materials as magnetic as the
earth, and placed at such    distance from the instrument as to
                                         a
subtend an angle of 2043", which            the greatest apparent
                                                      is
diameter of the moon as seen from the surface of the earth.
   Now Gauss found the magnetic moment of              steel magnet      a
bar one pound in weight, referred to his absolute unit, to be
100,877,000, and he has shown'l' that the moment of the earth’s
magnetism      equal to what would be produced
                    is                                   7'831 such       by
bars placed parallel to one another in each cubic metre of its
volume.    Hence the magnetic moment of           cubic metre mag—

7831 x 100,877,000; and multiplying this            '5236, the ratioby
of the  contents of   sphere to theacube  of  its diameter, we <U+FB01>nd
for the moment of the globe      metre in diameter, expressed in

                     M =0-5236 x 7831 x 100,877,000.
Again, 206264'8 being the number of seconds in radius unity,
the distance of the globe, in order to subtend the same angle as

the moon when nearest, will be              metres, or (to express
                                   2043
it   in Gauss’s unit of length)                            millimetres.
   Also, expressed      the same units, Gauss found the horizontal
                               in
intensity  at Glittingen on the 19th July, 1834;       17748, and        H:
the total intensity T=4'7414.     Therefore, <U+FB01>nally, the maximum
deviations, expressed in seconds, which the moon,      as magnetic       if
bulk for bulk as the earth, could produce at Gettingen were

  turbance   of the instrument    of declination does not amount, at its

      Now the observations with which these should be compared
 have been made at several stations.            The principal part of the
  observed lunar diurnal variation consists of a term depending
 on twice the lunar hour-angle, but there is also a small term
 containing the simple hour-angle. This latter is the one which,
 as Dr. Llo d has shown, the direct action of the moon wonld

                             —0'48 at Hobarton
for the inclination.
     There is then no ground for presuming, from the minuteness of
 the coef<U+FB01>cient, that the moon is not of as magnetic or even much
 more magnetic materials than the earth.               On the contrary, the
actual magnitudes of the coef<U+FB01>cients are too large to be with
probability attributed solely to the direct effect of the moon, even
if it were not evident from other considerations, that some cause
acting by different laws has contributed the greater part to them.
     If the comparison with the earth be made mass for mass
instead of bulk for bulk, the above disturbances must be reduced

thin layer on a  <U+FB02>at dish, and this was placed under    bell-jar       a
standing over milk-warm water, and kept continually <U+FB01>lled with
carbonic acid, the potassium was found in twenty-four hours to
be converted into     mixture of bicarbonate and of formiate of

The above mixture was supersaturated in the cold with sulphuric
acid, the acid liquor poured off from the bisulphate of potash
distilled, and the distillate neutralized with carbonate of lead.
On evaporating the hot <U+FB01>ltered solution, chemically pure for
miate of lead was obtained.
   Sodium exposed for twenty-four hours to the action of car
bonic acid and aqueous vapour, also gives rise to the formation
of formic acid, but in smaller quantity than potassium.

800                  M. Schischkoif     on Nitroform.
   He <U+FB01>nds that nitroform, G (N€)")"3 H, is a strong acid, and
readily exchanges its atom of hydrogen f0r metals, forming true
salts.    This hydrogen can also be replaced by bromine and by
hyponitrous acid.       When nitroi'orm, mixed with bromine, was
exposed    to  the sunlight, hydrobromie acid was formed, and the
mixture became decolorized.          The resultant product was washed
with water, in which it is somewhat soluble; it is liquid at tem
peratures above + 12° C., but below that point solidi<U+FB01>es to a cry
stalline mass. It has the formula G (N99)3 Br.
   In order to replace the hydrogen in nitroform by hyponitrous
acid, a current of air was passed through a mixture of nitroform
with sulphuric and nitric acids heated to 100°.              A liquid di
stilled over, from which, on the addition of water, an insoluble
oily liquid was precipitated.         This substance boils at 126° C.
without any decomposition; it is colourless, mobile, and <U+FB02>uid
at ordinary temperatures, but solidi<U+FB01>es at +13°C. to a white
crystalline mass. It has the composition G (N®*)4, and sin
gularly enough, although it contains an atom more hyponitrous
acid, it is more stable than nitroform ; it does not explode when
rapidly heated, but decomposes, giving off nitrous vapours.
    Schischko<U+FB01>' had found that trinitroacetonitrile, Q9 (NQ‘l)8 N,
was decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen,                 yielding a body
 G2 (NG)“’)‘i (N H") N, which he called binitroammonyle.          This he
has since found* to be the ammonium-salt of the body binitro
acefom'trile, G9 (N9?)$2 H N, which has strongly acid properties.
 Binitroacctonitrile is obtained by treating an aqueous solution of
binitroammonyle with sulphuric acid and agitating the mixture
with ether.      On evaporating the etherial solution, the acid cry
stallizes in large colourless plates.          The silver and potassium
salts of this body were prepared.           The silver-salt has the for
mula Q? (N€)")‘2 Ag N; when treated with bromine in presence of
water, bromide of silver is formed, and an oily product, which is
probably bromobinitroaeetonitrile, G2 (N99? Br N.
   A    series of experiments by Wurtz and Friedel on lactic
acid-l" con<U+FB01>rm the conclusion}; that lactic acid contains a dia
tomic radical, and that its two equivalents of replaceable hy
drogen are not of identical value.
    There are two ethers of lactic acid which are isomeric, but
completely di<U+FB02>'ercnt in properties.             One of them, ethylaetic
acid, is obtained by treating dilactate of cthyle with caustic
potash ; the other is neutral, and was <U+FB01>rst obtained by Strccker
in distilling lactate of lime with sulphovinate of potash.         W urtz

                 MM.Wurtz         and Friedel on Lactic Acid.                 301
and Friedel have found that it is also obtained by heating lactic
acid with alcohol in closed vessels to a temperature of 170°.
The former of these compounds is a true acid, and readily
forms salts.      When monoethylic lactate, as the latter compound
is called, is treated with potassium, hydrogen is disengaged, and a
compound is obtained isomeric with cthylaetate of potash, and
which, when treated with iodide of ethyle, forms dilactic other.
   These two ethers present a most curious example of isomerism.
They are formed by the same acid, both contain the same group
ethyle, and yet one of them is an energetic acid, while the other
is perfectly neutral. This is accounted for by the different parts
that the two atoms play in lactic acid.                One of them is strongly
basic, and can be replaced by a metal or by an organic group,
such as ethylc; in both cases'a neutral compound is obtained.
The other atom can be easily replaced by oxygen groups, such
as the radicals of monobasic acids. If replaced by an indifferent
group, such as ethyle, it is still acid, because the atom of basic
hydrogen has not been touched.                                             _
   The authors have noted similar isomeric relations between
lactamethane,      €"’H"NQ’,         and a new amide produced              by the
action of ethylamine on lactide, G3 “‘9’.                   By potash they un
dergo a different decomposition—the                 latter  into lactic acid and
ethylamine, and the former into ammonia and ethylactic acid.
   Lactyle, the radical of lactic acid, has the property of multi
plying itsclf in one and the same body so as to form compounds
which may be referred to condensed types analogous to the
polyethylenic compounds.

     Bisulphide of benzyle can readily be reduced to benzyle-mer
  captan by nascent hydrogen.
     Another remarkable and hitherto unexplained mode of form
 ing bisulphide of benzyle, by which it may be obtained in large
 transparent     crystals, consists in dissolving the mercaptan in
              ammonia and exposing the solution to spontaneous
 alcoholic
 evaporation.

     Kekulé has published* an interesting communication on fu
 maric and some allied organic acids.                 When malic acid,

     When fumaric acid is treated with bromine in the presence of
 water, no action takes place in the cold, but at the temperature
 of the water-bath the bromine rapidly disappears, and a quantity of
perfectly white crystals are obtained, which are dibromosuccinic
 acid, 'G‘ H4 Br‘1 9‘.     The formation of this body is interesting,
 inasmuch as it takes place by a simple addition of the elements,
 and not, as is usually the case in the action of bromine on
organic substances, by substitution: thus

hydriodic acid, but is most easily effected by means of nascent
hydrogen.       It is simpl necessary to add sodium-amalgam to a
solution of fumaric aci in water to convert it entirely into suc
cinic acid.

an organic substance unites directly with hydrogen.

   Kekulé has found that malcic acid, when acted upon by the
same reagents, yields the same bodies.
   In conclusion, he developcs his views as to the relations between
fumaric acid and its allied substances.      He establishes a close
and interesting analogy between fumaric acid and ethylene.
Fumarie acid stands in the same relation to malic acid as
ethylene does to alcohol; it stands to dibromosuccinic        acid as
ethylene does to bromide of ethylene ; and to monobromosuceinie
acid as ethylene to bromide of ethyle, and so on. Tartaric acid
is to fumaric acid what glycol is to ethylene.       In fact tartaric
acid is obtained when the bromide of fumaric acid, that        dibro    is,
mosuccinic acid,     heated with oxide of silver, just as an ether

   In Poggendor<U+FB02>’s Annalen for 1855, Kesslcr described volu                 a
metric method of estimating arsenic and antimony,            which      by
he made      determination of their atomic weights.
             a                                         The method
consisted in oxidizing these substances, which were emplo ed in
the form of arsenious and antimonious acids, to arsenic an anti
monie acids       by
                   means of     standard solution of bichromate of
                                     a
potash; the   excess  of bichromate of potash was determined                      by
means of     a standard solution of protochloride of iron.     The
applicability of this method depends upon the fact that proto
chloride of iron reduces bichromate of potash, but does not
affect arsenic or antimonie acid.    Kessler has since then made*
some additional experiments, partly con<U+FB01>rming and partly recti
fying previous results.
   From these experiments he concludes that the atomic weight
of arsenic   7515.
             is
   For the atomic weight of antimony, Kcssler’s previous                     experi~
ments led to the number 12378.          In his recent experiments,
in which some sources of error, to which his previous methods
were liable, have been avoided, he has obtained di<U+FB01>‘erent results.
   Pure oxide of antimony was prepared, and was further puri
         sublimation in    porcelain tube in      current of carbonic
      a by
<U+FB01>ed                           a                            a
acid;    given weight of   this  was  partially  oxidized       given  by   a
weight of pure chlorate of potash, and the oxidation completed
by means of standard solution of bichromate of potash; the
                  a
excess of the latter was estimated                by
                                                standard solution of
                                                       a
protochloride  of  iron.  In  this  way  six experiments gave num
bers for the equivalent of antimony, varying between 121'67 and
122-558, the mean being 122'16.
   In another case, in which pure metallic antimony was oxi

 dized to antimonic acid by bichromatc            of potash, the number
 found was 12234.
     In a third case, a double determination of terchloride of anti
 mony was made, by oxidation to pentachloridc, and by directly
 determining the quantity of_chlorine in the ordinary way. This
gave the number 122'37 for the equivalent of antimony.
     The mean of these results obtained by different methods is
 12229 ; they furnish a remarkable con<U+FB01>rmation of the excellent
 determinations of Dexter.         The method employed by this che
mist was that originally used by Berzelius, and consisted in the
 dircct oxidation of pure antimony to antimoniatc of oxide of
antimony, SbO’l.         By numerous very careful experiments he
obtained the mean number 12233.
    In the above series of experiments Kessler obtained the num
ber 26'1 for the atomic weight of chromium.
    De Luca describes* the following method of preparing oxygen
which he has used for some time; it only differs in manipula
tory details from that of Dcville and Debray'l'. A tubulated
retort is <U+FB01>lled three-quarters full with pumice and concentrated
 sulphuric acid, and lutcd on to a porcelain tube by means of a
mixture of asbestos and clay.           The tube also contains pumice;
it  is heated to redness, and the vapour of sulphuric acid passed
over it. The oxygen is disengaged with regularity, and is easily
puri<U+FB01>ed; in one operation 2 ounces of acid furnished about a
gallon and a quarter of gas. The process is analogous to that
in which hydrogen is prepared by decomposing water by iron ;
and it is not more dif<U+FB01>cult.
    Lapschin and Tichanowitschi have made a series of experi
ments on the electrolysis of organic and other substances, in
which they had at their disposal a battery of 1000 elements.
    Salicinc is decomposed by the battery ; the <U+FB01>rst stage appeared
to be its decomposition into grape-sugar and saligcnine.               On the
zinc pole gases were disengaged which were not collected; the
next stage appeared to be that the saligcnine was oxidized suc
cessively to hydride of salieylc and to salicylic acid.
    The action of a battery of 900 elements produced in crystal
lized acetic acid a rapid disengagement of gas at the carbon pole,
consisting of carbonic acid and carbonic oxide.               A very slight
quantity of gas was disengaged at the zinc pole, which, however,
was lost; at the same time an amorphous mass of carbon was
deposited.

    Absolute alcohol was almost unaffected by a battery of 900
elements; the quantity of gas collected after seven hours was so
small that it could not be analysed.         At <U+FB01>rst there was no
action, and a slight action was only set up after some time,
when the alcohol had attracted moisture by standing.         It may
be assumed, therefore, that absolute alcohol offers a complete
resistance to the current.
    Ether was unattacked by the action of a battery of 900 ele~
ments, even when the poles were only a millimetre apart. There
was no disengagement of gas; and the boiling-point remained
the same as before. When the electrodes were 20 millims.
asunder, there was an undulatory motion of the liquid from
the carbon to the zinc pole.
    With amylic alcohol 900 elements were used, the electrodes
being    I  millim. apart. The multiplier stood at 20°.  There was
an undulatory motion from the carbon to the zinc pole, and after
some time a yellowish deposit was formed on the zinc pole,
which, under the microscope, was seen to consist of a pulveru
lent mass of yellow colour. When, subsequently, the electrodes
were brought nearer, they melted together, the liquid became
heated, and a black carbonaceous mass was deposited.
     Valerianic acid, turpentine, and anhydrous boracic acid were
unaeted upon by a battery of 900 elements.
    950 elements produced no action on bisulphia'e of carbon ; the
multiplier stood at 0°. A previous experiment in 1858 with
800 elements gave an equally negative result.
     Silicic acid in the pulverulent form was placed in a clay
crucible and exposed to the action of the current. At <U+FB01>rst there
was no action, but afterwards the whole mass became ignited;
the side of the crucible nearest the zinc pole was perforated, and
a platinum globulc melted through, which was found to contain
silicon.
    300 elements produced no action on dry powdered oxide of
antimony, nor did 370 on ozychloride of antimony.
    With dried powdered oxide of zinc 370 elements produced an      ‘
energetic action, and the reduced zinc became ignited. The
decomposition       also ensued with 60 elements; even with 20
there was a slight action.
    40 elements acted strongly on sulphuret of antimony ; sulphur
was liberated at the charcoal pole and became ignited.
    Realyar required 260 elements for its decomposition; the
products of the action, sulphur and arsenic, immediately took
<U+FB01>re, and were converted into sulphurous and arsenious acids.

 THE“On         the Laws'v of the    Phenomena of the larger Disturbances
 of the Magnetic Declination in the Kew Observatory: with notices
 of the progress of our knowledge regarding the Magnetic Storms.”
 By Major-General Edward Sabine, R.A., Trees. and V.P.
    The laws manifested by the mean e<U+FB01>'ects of the larger magnetic
 disturbances (regarded commonly as effects of magnetic storms)
 have been investigated at several stations on the globe, being chie<U+FB02>y
 those of the British Colonial Observatories ; but hitherto there has
 been no similar examination of the phenomena in the British Islands
 themselves.      The object of the present paper is to supply this de
 <U+FB01>ciency, as far as one element, namely the declination, is concerned,
 by a <U+FB01>rst approximation derived from the photographs in the years
 1858 and 1859, of the self-recording declinometer of the observatory
 0f the British Association at Kew; leaving it to the photographs
 of subsequent years to con<U+FB01>rm, rectify, or render more precise the
results now obtained by a <U+FB01>rst approximation.            The method of in
 vestigation is simple, and may be brie<U+FB02>y described as follows :—
    The photographs furnish a continuous record of the variations
which take place in the direction of the declination-magnet, and ad
mit of exact measurement in the two relations of time, and of the
amount of departure from a zero line.           From this automatic record,
the direction of the magnet is measured at twenty-four equal inter
vals of time in every solar day, which thus become the equivalents
of the “hourly observations” of the magnetometers in use at the
Colonial Observatories. These measures, or hourly directions of the
magnet, are entered in monthly tables, having the days of the month
in successive horizontal lines, and the hours of the day in vertical
                             ”
columns. The “ means           of the entries in each vertical column indi
cate the mean direction of the magnet at the different hours of the
month to which the table belongs, and have received the name of
“ First Normals.”       On inspecting any such monthly table, it is at
once seen that a considerable        portion of the entries in the several
columns differ considerably from their respective means or <U+FB01>rst nor
mals, and must be regarded as
                                      “ disturbed observations.” The laws

years, months and hours, are then sought out, by separating for that
purpose a suf<U+FB01>cient body of the most disturbed observations, com
puting the amount of departure in each case from the normal of the
same month and hour, and arranging the amounts in annual, monthly,
and hourly tables.     In making these computations, the <U+FB01>rst normals
require to be themselves corrected, by the omission in each vertical
column of the entries noted as disturbed, and by taking fresh means,
representing the normals of each month and hour after this omission,
and therefore unin<U+FB01>uenced by the larger disturbances. These new

                                                                     '

   means have received the name of “ Final Normals,” and may be de
   <U+FB01>ned as being the mean directions of the magnet in every month and
   every hour, after the omission from the record of every entry which
   differed from the mean a certain amount either in excess or in defect.
      In this process there is nothing inde<U+FB01>nite ; and nothing arbitrary
   save the assignment of the particular amount of di<U+FB01>'erence from the
   normal which shall be held to constitute the measure of a large dis
   turbance, and which, for distinction sake, we may call “ the separating
   value.”    It must be an amount which will separate a suf<U+FB01>cient body
   of disturbed observations to permit their laws to be satisfactorily
  ascertained; but in other respects its precise value is of minor sig
  ni<U+FB01>cancy; and the limits within which a selection may be made,
  without materially affecting the results, are usually by no means
  narrow; for it has been found experimentally on several occasions,
  that the Ratios by which the periodical variations' of disturbance in
   different years, months and hours are characterized and expressed,do
  not undergo any material change by even considerable differences in
  the amount of the separating value. The separating value must ne
  cessarily be larger at some stations than at others, because the abso
  lute magnitude of' the disturbance-variation itself is very different in
   di<U+FB01>'erent parts of the globe, as well as its comparative magnitude in
  relation to the more regular solar-diurnal variation; but it must be
  a constant quantity throughout at one and the same station, or it
  will not truly show the relative proportion of disturbance in different
. years and different months.
      The strength of the Kew establishment being insuf<U+FB01>cient for
  the complete work of a magnetic observatory, the tabulation of
  the hourly directions from the photographic records has been per
  formed by the non-commissioned o<U+FB01>icers of the Royal Artillery,
  employed under my direction at Woolwich, where this work has been
  superintended by Mr. John Magrath, the principal clerk, as have
  been also the several reductions and calculations, which have been
  made on the same plan as those of the Colonial Observatories.
      In the scale on which the changes of direction of the declination
  magnet are recorded in the Kew photographs, one inch of space is
  equivalent to 22"04 of are.     On a general view and consideration of
  the photographs during 1858 and 1859, 0'15 inch, or 3"31 of
  arc appeared to be a suitable amount for the separating value to be
  adopted at that station; consequently every tabulated value which
  differed 3"31 or more, either in excess or defect from the <U+FB01>nal nor
  mal of the same month and hour, has been regarded as one of the
  larger disturbances, and separated accordingly.     The number of dis
  turbed observations in the two years was 2424 (viz. 12H in 18.58,
  and 1213 in 1859), being between one-seventh and one-eighth of the
  whole body of hourly directions tabulated from the photographs, of
  which the number was 17,319. The aggregate value of disturbance
  in the 24 24 observations, was 14,901 minutes of arc ; of which 7207
  minutes were de<U+FB02>ections of the north end of the magnet to the west,
  and 7694 to the east; the easterly de<U+FB02>ections thus having a slight
  preponderance.      The number of the disturbed observations, as well
  as their aggregate values, up roximated very closely in each of the
  two years, 1859 being very ightly in excess. The decennial period

of the magnetic storms, indicated by the observations       at the British
 Colonial Observatories between 1840 and 1850, had led to the antici
   ation that the next epoch of maximum of the cycle might take place
 in the years 1858-1859.      The nearly equal proportions in which the
 numbers and aggregate values of the larger disturbances took place
 in 1858 and 1859 are so far in accordance with this view.         Should
the records of the succeeding     cars at Kew, made with the same in
 struments, and examined by                                    tlie

distinct and dissimilar laws. The Ratios are also shown which the

Disturbances      of Magnetic Declination in the Kew Observatory. 313‘
    The westerly and easterly de<U+FB02>ections in the British Islands, as
represented by the automatic records at Kew, are obviously governed,
as in all other parts of the globe where the phenomena have been
analysed, by distinct laws. The westerly de<U+FB02>ections have their chief
prevalence from 5 A.M. to 5 P.M., or during the hours of the day;
the easterly deflections, on the other hand, prevail chie<U+FB02>y during the
hours of the night, the ratios being above unity from 7 PM. to 3 A.M.,
and below unity at all other hours.         The easterly have one decided
maximum, viz. at        ll  P.M., towards which they steadily and con~
tinuously progress from 5 P.M., and from which they as steadily and
continuously recede until 5 Add. the following morning.                The
westerly de<U+FB02>ections appear to have two epochs of maximum, one
from 6 to 7 A.M., the other about 3 P.M., progressing regularly
 towards the <U+FB01>rst named from 3 A.M., and receding from it to 9 A.M. ;
 at 9, 10, and l l A.M. the ratios remain almost sensibly the same, but
 towards noon they begin to increase afresh, and continue to do so
 progressively to the second maximum at 3 P.M., from which hour
 they progressively decrease to 7 P.M.        Those ratios which are less
 than unity, viz. those of the westerly de<U+FB02>ections from 6 PM. to
 4 A.M., and of the easterly from 4 A.M. to 6 P.M., do not in either
 case exhibit the same decided tendency to one or two well-marked
 minima, as the ratios which are above unity do in both cases towards
 their maxima. It is possible, however, that this may in some degree
 he explained by the following consideration :—
     The aggregate values of the disturbances prevailing at the di<U+FB02>'erent
 hours, as stated in the Table, are those which have prevailed, not
 only over the forces which would retain the magnet in its mean po
 sition, but also over any disturbing in<U+FB02>uences in an opposite direc
 tion, which may be conceived to have existed contemporaneously;
 and we cannot but suppose that as both westerly and easterly dis~
  turbances do record themselves as prevailing at the ame hours on
  di<U+FB02>'erent days, that these 0 posite in<U+FB02>uences may sometimes coexist,
  neutralizing each other and, not appearing in the record.       We may
  reasonably suppose     that the  degree in which the  aggregate values in
  the Table, both westerly and easterly, may be diminished thereby at
  the different hours, may be in some measure indicated by the dis
  parity, or the reverse, in the amount of the aggregate values of dis
  turbance in the opposite directions at those hours.         Thus we may
  suppose    that  at a particular  hour,  ll P.M.  for example, when the
  amount of westerly de<U+FB02>ections is very small, and of easterly very
  great, the diminution of the aggregate values of either by mutual
  counterbalance may be extremely small, while of equal absolute
  amount in both. Now a very small amount deducted from the large
  aggregate easterly value will scarcely have any effect whatsoever on
  the ratio at that hour to its unit or mean hourly value; whereas the
  same small amount deducted from the far less aggregate westerly
  value at the same hour would have a far more sensible effect upon
  its ratio.    Assuming, therefore, the probability that westerly and
  easterly disturbing in<U+FB02>uences do sometimes coexist and neutralize
  each other in the record, and that we may in some degree judge of
  the respective amounts of the con<U+FB02>icting in<U+FB02>uences at the several

  that the ratios which are below unity do not represent the actual
  variations of the disturbing in<U+FB02>uences at those. hours quite so purely
  as do the ratios which are above unity ; and that they are liable to
  be affected, though in a very subordinate degree, by the abstraction
  of the neutralized portion, when the aggregate values which they
  represent are very small.
      Without, however, resting undue weight upon this suggestion, we
  may safely say that the hours, when the ratios are below unity, are
  hours of comparative tranquillity, and that their variations from hour
  to hour are of a far less marked character than during the hours when
  the ratios exceed unity.     Thus viewed, the character of the disturb~
  ance-diumal variations may be conceived to have some analogy with
  that of the phenomena of the regular solar-diurnal variation. We may
  imagine the disturbance-variation (either the westerly or the easterly,
  it is indifferent which is taken),—divided as it is into two portions, by
  the ratios being in the one case above, and in the other below unity,—
, to correspond in one of its divisions to the hours when the sun is
  above the horizon, in the part of the hemisphere where the disturb
  ance may be imagined to originate, whilst the other division, or that
  in which the ratios are below unity, and manifest hours of compara
  tive tranquillity, may be viewed as the hours of night at the same
  locality.     The solar hours at a station of observation which are
  characterizedby disturbance ratios above unity, will in such case
   correspond in absolute time with the hours of the day at the sup
  posed originating locality, modi<U+FB01>cd (it may be) by a more or less
  rapid transmission of the disturbance.       It will be understood, that
  in this hypothetical suggestion, the purpOSe in view is to aid the
  imagination, if it may be so, in apprehending the ensemble of the
  phenomena as far as they are yet known to us, rather than to ad
  vance a theoretical explanation, when we have not yet sufficient facts
   before us by which it may be judged ; it may be remarked, however,
  that the conception of a double locality of origination of the disturb
  ances (easterly and westerly) in the one hemisphere will present no
  especial dif<U+FB01>culty to those who are conversant with the general facts
   of terrestrial magnetism.
      If our attention be limited to the consideration of the facts observed
   at a single station, unaccompanied by a'view of corresponding pheno
   mena elsewhere, we might be in danger of regarding some of the
   features, particularly perhaps those which are not the most pro
   minent, as having an accidental rather than a systematic origin;
   and we might thus lose a portion of the instruction which they
   may otherwise convey. On this account it has appeared desirable
   to exhibit the phenomena as observed at a second station, in com
   parison with those at Kew ; and I have selected for this purpose the
   results of a similar investigation to the present at Hobarth in
   Tasmania; not only because the facts have been remarkably well
   determined there, but also because, though it is a very distant station,
   differing widely in geographical latitude and longitude, and situated
   indeed in a different hemisphere, there is a striking resemblance

 Disturbances    of Magnetic Declination in Me Kew      Observatory.  315 H.
in the laws of the magnetic storms     experienced at both.   This resem
blance, which is not only general, but extends to very minute par
 ticulars, is such that it seems impossible to resist the impression that
 the accordance cannot be accidental ; and that the methods of obser
 vation and of analysis which have been pursued, have proved themselves
 well adapted to open to us the knowledge of the existence of system
 atic laws, pervading and regulating the action of the forces which
 are in daily operation around us, and are at least co-extensive with
 the limits of our globe ; and thus to lead us ultimately to the correct
 theory of these forces.    I have placed therefore beside each other in
 the next Table the Ratios of Disturbance at the different hours of local
 solar time at each of the two stations, separating them as before
 into westerly and easterly de<U+FB02>ections, and placing the westerly de<U+FB02>ec
 tions at Kew in immediate juxtaposition with the easterly at Hobar
 ton, and vice versd, as that obviously constitutes the just compari
 son. The Hobarth Ratios exhibit the relative prevalence of dis
 turbance at the several hours, derived from hourly observations con
 tinued for seven years and nine months, viz. from January 1, 1841
 to September 30, 1848 ; a series unparalleled in duration at any other
 of the Colonial Observatories, and which has borne admirably, as       I
shall hope to have a future opportunity of explaining to the Society,
an unquestionable test of its substantial accuracy and <U+FB01>delity.      The
number of recorded hourly observations was 56,202, of which 7638
differed from their respective normals of the same month and hour
by an amount equalling or exceeding T13 of arc, and constituted
the body of separated observations from which the aggregate value!
of disturbance at the di<U+FB01>'erent hours and their ratios have been
obtained.      The proportion of disturbed observations thus separated,
to the whole body of observations, is about 1 in 7'35 ; differing very
little from the proportion already noticed as obtained at Kew by a
 separating value of 3"3. The disturbing effects due to'magnetic
 storms are therefore somewhat greater at Kew than at Hobarton,
  though some portion of the difference may be ascribed to the cir
  cumstance, that the terrestrial horizontal force, antagonistic to the
  disturbing forces and tending to retain the magnet in its mean
 position, is less at Kew than at Hobarton, in the proportion, approx
imately, of 3'7 to 4'5.

       For the convenience of those who prefer graphical illustration, 1
  have represented on an accompanying woodcut the results to which
  1 have referred. The curves drawn in unbroken black lines, in <U+FB01>gures
  1 and 2, show the phenomena at Kew; those in dotted lines in the
  same <U+FB01>gures, the phenomena at Hobarton.             Fig. 1 presents westerly
  disturbances at Kew, and easterly at Hobarton in comparison with
  each other; they are obviously allied phenomena.                Fig. 2 presents
  easterly disturbances at Kew and westerly at Hobarton; these are
'also, obviously, allied Phenomena,       but are as obviously governed by
   distinct laws from those in <U+FB01>g. 1.
       Had the phenomena at KeW and Hobarton been the only ones
   known to us, we might have inferred that we had obtained the
   characteristic forms of the diurnal variations due to the action of two
   distinct and independent forces; and we might have expected with
   some degree of con<U+FB01>dence to have found curves of corresponding
   form by a similar analysis elsewhere ;—-and so far experience has
   been in accord with expectation.        But, as the forms of these two
   pair of curves are not only respectively similar, but as they also
   correspond in the [tours at which their chief characteristic features
   occur, we might also have formed an inference which would have
   proved erroneous, viz. that the hours as well as the forms would be
   the same at other stations.          Now this is so far from being in

     It may not be unsuitable on the present occasion to take a brief
 retrospective view of the progress of our knowledge respecting these
 remarkable phenomena, videlieet, the casual magnetic disturbances,
 or magnetic storms.       Antecedently to the formation of the German
 Magnetic    Association   and the publication of its <U+FB01>rst Annual Report
 in 1837, our information concerning them went no further than that
 there occurred at times, apparently not of regular recurrence, extra
 ordinary agitations or perturbations of the magnetic needle, which
 had been noticed in several instances to have taken place contempo
 raneously in parts of the European continent distant from each other;
 and to have been accompanied          by remarkable displays of Aurora,
 seen either at the locality itself where the needle was disturbed, or
 observed contemporaneously elsewhere.          The opinion which appears
 to have generally prevailed at this time, was that the Aurora and
 the magnetic disturbances were kindred phenomena, originating pro
 bably in atmospherical derangements, or connected at least in some
 way with disturbances of the atmospherieal equilibrium.              They
 were classed accordingly as “ Meteorological Phenomena,” and were
 supposed to have a local, though it might be in some instances a
 wide, extension and prevalence.
     The special purpose of the German Magnetic Association was to
 subject the “irregular magnetic disturbances” (as they were then
 called in contradistinctiou to the regular periodical and secular varia
 tions) to a more close examination, by means of systematized ub~
 servations made simultaneously in many parts of Germany. With this
  view, six concerted days in each year were set apart in which the di
  rection of the declination-magnet should be observed with great
 accuracy, by methods then for the <U+FB01>rst time introduced, at successive
  intervals of <U+FB01>ve minutes for twenty-four consecutive hours ; the me
  teorological instruments being observed at the same time.            The
  clocks at all the stations were set to Gottingen mean time (Giittingen
  being the birth-place of the Association), and the observations were
  thus rendered strictly simultaneous throughout.          The high respect
  entertained for the eminent persons with whom the scheme of the
  Association originated, obtained for it a very extensive cooperation,
  not limited to Germany alone, but extending over agreat part of the
  European Continent.         The observations of the “Term-days,” as
 they   were  called,  were  maintained   until 184], and were all trans
 mitted to Gottingen for coordination and comparison.
     The principal results of this great and admirably conducted co
 operative undertaking were published in works well known to mag
 neticians. They may be summed up as follows :—-The phenomena
 which were the subjects of investigation were shown to be of casual

  Disturbances    of Magnetic Declination in      the   Kew Observatory. 319
   and not regular occurrence; to prevail contemporaneously everywhere
 within the‘limits comprehended by the            observations ; and to exhibit
   a correspondence     surprisingly great, not only in the larger, but even
   in almost all the smaller oscillations; so that, in the words of the
   Reporters, MM. Gauss and Weber, “ nothing in fact remained which
   could justly be ascribed to local causes.”
       Equally decided were the conclusions drawn against the previously
  imagined connexion between the magnetic disturbances and derange
  ments of the atmosphere, or particular states of the weather. No per
  ceptible in<U+FB02>uence whatsoever on the needle appeared to be produced
  either by wind-storms or by thunder-storms, even when close at hand.
      The correspondence in the simultaneous movements of the declina
  tion-magnet, so strikingly manifested over an area of such wide extent,
  was however more remarkable in respect to the direction of a per
  turbation than to its amount.        The disturbances at different stations,
  and even, as was expressly stated, at all the stations, coincided, even
 in the smaller instances, in time and in direction, but with dissimilar
 proportions of magnitude.         Thus it was found generally that by far
 the greater number of the anomalous indications were smaller at the
 southern stations and larger at the northern; the difference being
 greater than would be due to the difference in the antagonistic
 retaining force      (i.e. the horizontal force of the earth’s magnetism,
 which   is    greater at the southern than at the northern stations).
 The generality of this occurrence led to the unavoidable inference,
 that, in Europe, the energy of the disturbing force must be regarded
 weaker as we follow its action towards the south.
     A close and minute comparison of the simultaneous movements at
 stations in near proximity to each other led to the further conclusion,
 also stated to be unavoidable, that
                                          “ various forces must be admitted
 to be contemporaneously in action, being probably quite independent
 of each other, and having very different sources        ;   the effects of these
 various    forces   being  intermixed   in  very   dissimilar   proportions at
 various places     of observation  according   to the directions  and distances
 of   these  from  the  sources  whence  the  perturbations    proceed.”     (Re
 sultate aus den Beob. des Mag. Vereins, 1836. pp. 99, 100.) The
dif<U+FB01>culty of disentangling the complications which thus occur at every
individual station was fully foreseen and recognized; and the Report,
which bears the initial of M. Gauss, concludes with the remark that
“it will be triumph of science,
              a                         if   at some future time we should
succeed in reducing into order the manifold intricacies of the com
binations, in separating from each other the several forces of which
they are the compound results, and in assigning the source and
measure of each.”
     Such was the state of the             when it   was entered upon by the
Royal Society. The Report inr‘luiry
                                  0   the Committee of Physics drawn up
(inter alia) for the guidance of the Magnetic Observatories esta—
blished by ILM. Government for           a    limited period in four of the
British Colonies, bears date in 1840.          The objects proposed by this
Report were       a   very considerable enlargement upon those of the
German Association, as well as an extension of the research to more
distant parts of the globe.         The German observations           had been

320    ,                     Royal Society   :—
limited for the most part to one only of the three elements required
in a complete investigation.          When the German Association com
menced its Operations,       the  Declination  was the sole element for which
an apparatus       had   been   devised  capable of recording its variations
with    the  necessary precision.      To  meet the de<U+FB01>ciency in respect to
the horizontal component of the magnetic force, M. Gauss constructed
in 1837 his bi<U+FB01>lar magnetometer, which was employed at Giittingen
and at some few of the German stations, concurrently with the
 Declinometer, in the term observations of the concluding years of
 the Association.      But an apparatus for the corresponding observa
 tion of the vertical portion of the Force was as yet wholly wanting;
without such an apparatus as a companion to the bitilar, no deter
 mination could be made of the perturbations or momentary changes
 of the magnetic Dip and Force: and withouta knowledge of these no
 satisfactory conclusion in regard to the real nature, amount and
 direction of the perturbing forces could be expected.          The ingenuity
 of Dr. Lloyd supplied the desideratum by devising the vertical force -
 magnetometer, which, with adequate care, has been found scarcely, if
  at all, inferior to the bitilar in the performance of its work.         The
 scheme of the British Observatories was thus enabled to comprehend
 all the data required for the investigation of the casual disturbances,
  whether that investigation was to be pursued as before by concerted
  simultaneous observations at di<U+FB01>'ercnt stations, or, as suggested in the
  Report, by the determination of the laws, relations and dependencies
  of the disturbances at individual stations obtained indelmzdcnlly and
  without concert with other observers or other stations.             Thus, in
  reference to these articular phenomena, the British system was both
  an enlargement      anii an extension of the objects of the German Asso
  ciation; but   it   also embraced within its scope the determinations
  witha     precision, not previously attempted, of the absolute values of
  the three elements, and of the periodical and progressive changes to
  which they are subject; premising however, and insisting with               a
  sagacity which has been fully justi<U+FB01>ed by subsequent experience, on
  the necessity of eliminating in the <U+FB01>rst instance the e<U+FB01>'ects of the
   casual and transitory variations, as an indispensable preliminary to       a
   correct knowledge and analysis of the progressive and periodical
   changes.  A     further prominency was given to investigations into the
   particular class of phenomena which form the subject of this paper,
   by the declaration that
                                 “ the theory of the transitory changes  is  in
   itself one of the most interesting and important points to which the
   attention of magnetic inquirers can be turned, as they are no doubt
   intimately connected with the general causes of terrestrial magnetism,
   and will probably lead us to  a      much more perfect knpwledge of these
   causes than we now possess.”
       The instructions contained in the Royal Society’s Report for the
   adjustments and manipulation of the several instruments provided for
   these purposes were clear, simple and precise.         In looking back upon
    them after the completion of the services for which they were
            it
    designed,    is  impossible to speak of the instructions otherwise than
    with unquali<U+FB01>ed praise.        But the guidance afforded by the instruc
    tions terminated with the completion of the observations. To have

 Disturbances      of Magnetic Declination in  the ch Observatory.      321
  attempted to prescribe the methods by which conclusions, the nature
  of which could not be anticipated, should be sought out from observa
  tions not yet made, would have been obviously premature. Yet
  without some discussion of the results, the mere publication of un
  reduced observations is comparatively valucless.        It has been well
  remarked by an eminent authority, whose opinions expressed in the
  Royal Society's Report have been frequently referred to in the course
  of this paper, that “ a man may as well keep aregister of his dreams,
  as of the weather, or any other set of daily phenomena, if the spirit
  of grouping, combining, and eliciting results be absent.” v It was
  indispensable that the attempt should be made to gather in at least
   the <U+FB01>rst fruits of an undertaking on which a considerable amount of
   public money and of individual labour had been expended; and the
   duty of making the attempt might naturally be considered to rest on
   the person who had been entrusted with the superintendence of the
   Government Observatories.        The methods and processes adopted for
-
    reducing, combining, eliminating, and otherwise eliciting results were
   necessarily of a novel description ; they were in fact an endeavour to
   <U+FB01>nd a way by untrodden paths to simple and general phenomenal
   laws where no de<U+FB01>nite knowledge of the origin or mode of causation
    of the phenomena previously existed. Happily it is not necessary
    to trespass on the time or attention of the Society by a description
    of the methods and processes which have been employed to elucidate
    some of the leading features of the magnetic storms, as these are fully
    described in the discussions pre<U+FB01>xed to the ten large volumes in which
    the observations at the Colonial Observatories have been printed. It
    will be only necessary to advert, and that very brie<U+FB02>y, to some of the
    principal conclusions which may be supposed to throw most light on
     the theory of these phenomena.
         The results of the extension of the term-day comparisons to the
     American Continent, and to the Southern Hemisphere and the
     Tropics, may <U+FB01>rst be disposed of in a very few words. The contem
     poraneous character of the disturbances, which had been shown by
     the German term-observations to extend over the larger portion of the
     European Continent, manifested itself also in the comparisons of the.
     term-days in 1840, 184], and 1842 at Prague andBreslau in Europe,
     and Toronto and Philadelphia in America, published ‘in 184:7; and
     the same conclusion was obtained by comparing with each other the
      term-days at the Colonial Observatories, situated in parts of the globe
     most distant from one another. The days of disturbance stillnppeared
      to be of casual occurrence, but were now recognized as affections com
      mon to the whole globe, showing themselves simultaneously at stations
      most widely removed from each other. When distant stations were
      compared, as for example stations in Europe with those in America,
      and either or both with Tasmania, discrepancies in the amount of par
      ticular perturbations, similar to those which had been found in com
      paring thc European stations with each other, presented themselves,
      but larger and more frequent, and extending occasionally even to the
      reversal of the direction of the simultaneous disturbance.    Instances
      were not nnfrequent of the same element, or of different elements,
      being disturbed at the same observation-instant in Europe and

     822                           Royal Socier :—
     America; and on the other hand, there were perturbations, sometimes
     of considerable magnitude, on the one continent, of which no trace
     was visible on the other.      Hence it was concluded, with the increased
     con<U+FB01>dence due to this additional and more extensive experience,
     that various forces proceeding from different sources were contem
     poraneously in action; and it was further inferred that the most
     suitable and promising mode of pursuing the investigation was by an
    endeavour to analyse the effects produced at individual stations, and
    to resolve them if possible into their respective constituents.
        The heurly observations which had becn commenced at the
    Colonial stations in 1841 and 1842, and continued through several
'
    subsequent years, furnished suitable materials for this investigation,
    the <U+FB01>rst fruits of which were the discovery, that the disturbances,
    though casual in the times of their occurrence, and most irregular
  ‘when individual perturbations only were regarded, were, in their
    mean effects, strictly periodical phenomena; conforming in each
    element, and at each station, on a mean of many days, to a law de-.
    pendent on the solar hour; thus constituting a systematic mean
    diurnal variation distinct from the regular daily solar-diurnal variation,
    and admitting of being separated from it by proper processes of
    reduction.     This conformity of the disturbances to a law depending
    on the solar hours was the <U+FB01>rst known circumstance which pointed to
    the sun as their primary cause, whilst at the same time a difference in
    the mode of causation of the regular- and of the disturbance-diurnal
    variations seemed to be indicated by the fact, that in the disturbance
    variation the local hours of maximum and minimum were found to
    vary (apparently without limit) in different meridians, in contrast to
    the general uniformity of those hours in the previously and more
   generally rccognized regular solar-diurnal variation.
       This <U+FB01>rst reference of the magnetic storms to the sun as their
   primary cause, was soon followed by a far more striking presumptive
    evidence of the same, by a further discovery of the existence of a
   periodical variation in the frequency of occurrence, and amount of
   aggregate effects, of the magnetic storms, corresponding in period,
   and coincident in epochs of maximum and minimum, with the dc
   cennial variation in the frequency and amount of the spots on the
   sun’s disk, derived by Schwabe from his own systematic observations
   commenced in 1826 and continued thenccforward.                   The decennial
   variation of the magnetic storms is based on the observations of the
   four widely distributed Colonial Observatories, and is concurred
   in by all.        This remarkable correspondence            between the mag
   netic storms and physical changes in the sun’s photosphere, of
   such enormous magnitude as to be visible from the earth even by
  the unassisted eye, must be held to terminate altogether any hypo
  thesis which would assign to the cause of the magnetic disturbances
  a local origin on the surface or in the atmosphere              of our globe, or
  even in the terrestrial magnetism itself, and to refer them, as cos
  mical phenomena, to direct solar in<U+FB02>uence; leaving for future solu
  tion the question of the mode in which that in<U+FB02>uence produces the
  effects which we believe we have thus traced to their source in the
  central body of our system'.
      * The existence of a decennial period of the magnetic storms was not, as some

  Disturbances      of Magnetic Declination in the Kew Observatory. 323
     ‘We ma regard as a step towards this solution the separation of
  the disturbances of the declination into two distinct forces acting in
  different directions and proceeding apparently from different foci;
  the phenomena of distinct (though in so many respects closely allied)
  variations exhibit the same peculiar features at all the stations to
  which the analysis has hitherto extended, and. have been exempli<U+FB01>ed
  by the observations at Kew, as shown in the early part of this paper.
  A similar separation into two independent affections, each having its
  own distinct phenomenal laws, has followed from an analysis of the
  same description                 to the disturbances of the magnetic dip and
  force at the Colonia   applied
                              stations; thus placing in evidence, and tracing
  the approximate laws of the effects of six distinct forces (two in each
  element) contemporaneously in action in- all parts of the globe, and
  pointing in no doubtful manner to the-existence of two terrestrial
  foci or sources in each hemisphere from which‘the action of the forces
  emanating from the sun and communicated to the earth may be con
. ceived to proceed.          Such an ascription naturally suggests to those
  conversant     with   the  facts  of terrestrial magnetism the possibility that
  Halley’s     two   terrestrial   magnetic foci in each hemisphere may be
  either   themselves     the  localities  in question, or may be in some way
  intimately    connected     with   them.    The important observations which
  we owe to the zeal and devotion of Captain Maguire, R.N. and the
  Of<U+FB01>cers of H.M.S. ‘ Plover,’ have made us acquainted with Point Bar
  row as a locality where the magnetic disturbances prevail with an
  energy far beyond ordinary experience, indicating the proximity of
  that station to the source or sources from which the action of the
  forces may proceed.          Now Point Barrow is situated in a nearly inter
  mediate position between what we believe to be the present localities of
  Halley’s northern foci, and at no great distance from either: in such
  a situation the exposure to disturbing in<U+FB02>uences proceeding from both
  might well be supposed to be very great. The displays of Aurora at
  Point Barrow exceed also in numerical frequency any record received
  from any other part of the globe.
      The further prosecution of this investigation ap ears to stand in
  need of some more systematic proceeding than wou d be supplied by
  the uncombined efforts of individual zeal.             Observations similar to
  those of the Kew Observatory, made at a few stations in the middle
  latitudes of the hemisphere, distributed with some approach to
  symmetry in their longitudinal distances apart, would probably fur
  liavc supposed, a fortuitous discovery; but a consequence of a process of exami
   nation early adopted and expressly devised, by the employment of a constant sepa
   rating value, to make knovm any period of longer or shorter duration which might
  fall within the limits comprised by the observations.   The period being decennial,
  and the epoch of minimum occurring at the end of 1843 or beginning of 1844,
  the epoch of maximum was necessarily waited for in order to ascertain the precise
  duration of the cycle. The maximum took place in 1848—1849, the observations
   in 1850 and 1851 showing that the aggregate value of the annual disturbances
   was again diminishing as it had been in 1842 and 1843.       The process of deter
   mining the proportion of disturbance in different years is a somewhat laborious
   one, and requires time: but in March 1852, I was able to announce to the Royal
   Society the existence of a decennial variation, based on the concurrent testimony
   of the observations at Toronto and Hobarton ; deeming it proper that so remark
   able a fact should not be publicly stated until it had been thoroughly assured
   by independent observations at two very distant parts of the globe.

 nish data, which by their combination might serve to assign the
 localities from whence the disturbances are propagated—contribute
 still further to disentangle the complications of the forces which pro
 duce thcm,—and thus hasten the attainment of that “triumph of
 science” foreseen and foreshadowed           by the great geometrician of
 the last age.    Of such a nature was the schemc contemplated by
 the Joint Committee of the Royal Society and British Association,
 and submitted to ILM. Government in the hope of obtaining
 their aid in the execution of such part of it as fell within British
 dominion; and of thus “ maintaining and perpetuating our national
 claim to the furtherance and perfecting of this magni<U+FB01>cent depart
                                                       ‘                     ’
 ment of physical inquiry."           (Herschel in       Quarterly Review
 September 1840, p. 277.)        The scheme was no unreasonable one:
 probably eight or nine statiOns in the contour of the hemisphere
 might suf<U+FB01>ce; and of these we already possess the observations at
 Toronto; those at Kew are in progress; and self-recording instru
 ments, similar to those at Kew, are now under veri<U+FB01>cation at Kew pre
 paratory to being employed on the \Vcstern or Paci<U+FB01>c side of the
 United States Territory, at a point not far from the previously desired
 Station of Vancouver Island, for which a substitute is thus provided.
This Observatory, as well as one at Key \Vest on the southern coast
 of the United States, in which self-recording instruments are already
at work, will be maintained under the authority and at the expense
of the American Government, and both have been placed under the
superintendcncc of the able and indefatigable director of the “ Coast
Survey,” Dr. Alexander Dallas Bache.            The Russian Observatory at
Pckin, the trustworthy observations of which are already known to
the Society, is understood to have rccommcnccd its hourly observa
tions, and stands only in need of an apparatus for the vertical force
(which might be readily supplied from this country), to contribute
its full complement to the required data.        M ore than half the stations
may therefore be regarded as already pr0vidcd for, and there are
other Russian observatories in the desired latitudes and longitudcs
Which might be completed with instruments for a full participation.
    It would be wrong to conclude these imperfect notices without
recognizing how greatly the researches have been aided in thcir
progress by the united and unfailing countenance and support of the
Royal Society and ofthe Britiin Association.         The Kew Observatory
owes its cxistcncc and maintenance         to funds  most liberally supplied
from year to year by the British Association ; and the cost of the
sclfrecording magnetic instruments, of which the <U+FB01>rst instalment. of
the results has formed the early part of this paper, was supplied from
funds at the disposal of the Council of the Royal Society.

      At some places near Reading (Maidenhatch Farm, about six miles
 to the W.; and Tilehurst, two miles to the S.W.), and also near
  Maidenhead, from 18 to 20 feet of broken chalk overlies the true
  chalk; and in places is overlain by the bottom-bed of the Reading
  Beds, and therefore must have been reconstructed before the depo
  sition of the Tertiary strata. For the most part, however, in Berk
  shire the VVoolwich and Reading Beds rest on an undisturbed surface
  of the Chalk.    In 'Wiltshire also the author has observed similarly
  reconstructed chalk, probably there also underlying Tertiary beds;

 ANALYSIS OF GYROLITE.                BY HENRY How, PROFESSOR OF CHE
          MIS'I‘RY, KING’S COLLEGE, WINDSOR, NOVA SCOTIA.
            mineral gyrolite was <U+FB01>rst described by Professor Anderson
(rHE     of Glasgow“ as a new species from the Isle of Skye; it is
 stated by Greg and Lettsom'l' to occur without doubt at two loca
lities in Greenland, and, according to Heddle, at Face. The only
 other notice of it that I am acquainted with is by L. Saemanni, who
 mentions that he examined a specimen, no locality being given,
 mixed or inter-laminated with pectolitc, and suggests that this mi
 neral losing its alkali becomes gyrolite, and losing its lime becomes
 Okenite.      No other analysis than the original one of Professor
 Anderson has, I believe, been published; the following account of
 its occurrence among the minerals of Nova Scotia shows it in such
 association as affords a mode of explaining its origin by change in
 apophyllite :--I met with it in Anapolis County, N. S., some twenty
 <U+FB01>ve miles south-west of Cape Blomidon, between Margaretville and
 Port George, on the surface of fractured crystalline apophyllite ; and
 on further breaking the mass a good many spherical concretions of
 pearly lustrous plates were observed in the interior, of sizes varying
 from that of a pin’s head to nearly half an inch in diameter: their
 outline was well de<U+FB01>ned, and the external characters as given by
 Anderson were recognized on examination; it afforded the following
 results on analysis :—'1‘he mineral was ignited for water, and the
 residue treated with HCl ; the resulting dried silica was weighed, and
 then fused with carbonated alkali ; and the weight of the small quan
 tities of alumina, 810. so separated was deducted from that of the

 A general accordance is        observed su<U+FB01>icient to show the identity
 of chemical composition in the minerals examined ; the small quan
 tity of potassa present'in my specimen probably modi<U+FB01>ed the blow
 pipe character a little, as I found it not to exfoliate completely,
 and it fused without any dif<U+FB01>culty, and even with some ebullition.
    Some of the numerous cavities in the apophyllite were empty.
 some entirely <U+FB01>lled with gyrolite, and in others separate plates of
 this mineral were standing edgewise, leaving vacant spaces, while
 upon and by the side of the plates were in some cases rhombohedral
 crystals which proved to consist of calcite, and were sometimes pre
 sent alone in the cavities, which varied from being quite shallow to
 half an inch in depth. It is mentioned by Anderson that gyrolite
 occurs associated with stilbite, Laumonite, and other zeolites, and is
 sometimes found coating crystals of apophyllite.
    The difference in chemical composition between apophyllite and
 gyrolite is very well seen on comparing the respective theoretical
 per-centages of their constituents, thus :—

 Gyrolite ‘       '    = 5218      32'26                1550
 and the existence of the calcite in the cavities seems clearly to show
 that the gyrolite is formed from the apophyllite by the waters which
 deposited the carbonate of lime reacting on the silicate of potash,
 and dissolving out at the same time the <U+FB02>uorine as <U+FB02>uoride of cal
 cium* : trial was made for <U+FB02>uorine on two fragments of the gyrolite,
 but no evidence of its existence obtained.—Si11iman’s American

  PRODUCTION        OF  THE GREEN MATTER on LEAVES UNDER THE
     INFLUENCE       OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT. BY M. HERVE MANGON.
     It appeared interesting to ascertain whether the green matter de
  veloped so readily in youngleaves imposed to the sun, was also pro
  duced under the in<U+FB02>uence of the bright light of the electric lamp.
  This experiment has been tried by the kind aid of M. Allard, chief
  engineer of lighthouses, who has allowed me to use for several days
 the powerful apparatus under his control.
     The electricity was produced by a powerful electro-magnetic ma
  chine driven by a steam-engine.        The-light was that of a charcoal
 lamp.
     The lamp was lit for eleven hours on the 30th of July, twelve
 hours on July 31, Aug. 1, and Aug. 2, and eleven hours and a half
  on Aug. 3. The temperature of the air varied from 22° to 25° C.,
  and that of the earth from 19° to 21° C.
     On the 80th of July, at 8 in the morning, small <U+FB02>ower-pots, each
-containing four grains of rye, sown respectively on the 24th, 26th,
  27th, and 28th of July, were placed in a perfectly dark room, about a
  yard from the lamp, and about 2 feet below the luminous focus, and
  without the interposition of any glass.
     The grains sown on the 24th and 26th had sprouted; the stalks

The grains sown on the 27th and,28th of July had not sprouted
on the 31st of July at 2 o’clock; the plants sown on the 24th and

             EMPLOYED IN‘REINSCII’S TEST non ARSENIC.
   . Lippert  has madéa Careful examination of the crust which forms
 upon    bright pmctallictcoppcr when this is placed in a solution of
 arsenic acidi<U+FB01>ed with _'ch_lorhydric ,acid.     "l‘his _coating had. been

 p. 141) called attention to the fact that it contained a large quan-'

 that the crust in question contains only 32 per cent. of arsenic, 68
 per cent. of its weight being copper. .This composition having been
 nearly, constant in sevéral specimens which he analysed, Lippert
 maintains that the compound is a de<U+FB01>nite alloy, As Cus. 'VVhen
 ignited, at the temperature of a combustion furnace, in a current of
 hydrogen, the compound lost only 7 per cent. of its weight, an alloy
 of the composition As Cu6 (same as that of the mineral Domeykite
 of F. Field) being formed.
     The delicacy of Reinsch's test is evidently directly referable to the
 large amount of copper which the characteristic coating contains;
 for a proportionally small quantity of arsenic is thus obtained in an
 enlarged and, as it were, more tangible form.               But, on the other
 hand, ,it is not easy to prove in a simple manner the presence of
 arsenic in this crust; for only a small portion of the arsenic can be
 Volatilizcd in a current of hydrogen, and even if the alley be <U+FB01>rst
  oxidized in a current of air and then reduced in‘a current of hy
  drogen, the pcr-centage of arsenic only falls from 3'2 to 20. By far
  the largest portidn of the arsenic is therefore kept out of sight.            .
      For the details of this interesting research, and the author's dis

  arsenic quantitatively by determining the amount of copper which
  dissolves while the arsenic is being precipitated, we must refer to

 IN    peared at page 89 of the 20th volume of this Magazine, we
 showed that the bright lines observed in the spectra of the incan
 descent vapour of certain metallic compounds may be employed as
 the most sure and delicate tests for ascertaining the presence of
 these metals.     The analytical method founded upon such obser
 vations is of pecial importance when applied to the examination
 of groups of substances either occurring in very small quantities
 or possessing nearly identical chemical characters, because in
 these special cases this mode of examination introduces a whole
 series of most delicate distinctive reactions, hitherto wholly un
 known.     Considering how much more delicate the spectrum
 reactions are than the ordinary chemical tests, it appeared to us
 that this method would serve especially well for discovering the
presence of substances which might have been overlooked by the
rough methods previously employed, either because the bodies
occurred in very mall quantities, or because they were not
 distinguishable by the ordinary tests from other well-known
bodies.     This assumption was veri<U+FB01>ed by the <U+FB01>rst appeal to ex
periment ; for we have succeeded in discovering the presence of
two new alkaline metals in addition to potassium, sodium, and
lithium, notwithstanding that they both give all the character
istic precipitates of the potash salts, and occur in such minute
 quantities that, in order to obtain a few grammes of these sub
stances, or a suf<U+FB01>cient amount for investigation, we had to ope
rate upon 4-4,000 kilogrammes (about 40 tons) of the mineral
water of Durkheim, and upon 180 kilogs. of Lepidolite.

   If    a drop of the mother-liquor of the Diirkheim water be
brought into the <U+FB02>ame of the spectrum-apparatus, the charac
teristic lines of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, and stron
tium are at once seen.      If the lime, strontia, and magnesia be
 separated according   to well-known   processes, and if the residual
alkaline bases in the form of nitrates be washed out with alcohol
and the lithium removed as completely as possible by precipita
tion with carbonate of ammonium, a mother-liquor is obtained
which in the spectrum-apparatus shows the lines of sodium,
potassium, and lithium, but besides these, two splendid blue lines
situated close together, and almost coinciding with the blue
strontium line Sr 8.
    As no known elementary body produces two blue lines in this
portion of the spectrum, we may consider the existence of this
hitherto unknown alkaline element as thus placed beyond a doubt.
    The facility with which a few thousandths of a milligramme
of this body may be recognized by the bright blue light of its
incandescent vapour, even when mixed with large quantities of
the more common alkalies, has induced us to propose for it the
name Cesium (and the symbol Cs), derived from the Latin
“
   caesius,” used to designate the blue of the clear sky*.
    If Saxony lcpidolite be treated by any of the known plans
for separating the alkalies from the other constituents, and if
the solution of the alkalies thus obtained be precipitated with
bichloride of platinum, an abundant precipitate is formed, which,
when examined in the spectrum-apparatus, shows only the bright
potassium lines.     If this precipitate be repeatedly washed with
boiling water, and the residual salt occasionally examined in the
apparatus, two splendid violet lines, lying between the strontium
line Sr 8 and the blue potassium line KB, will be noticed on the
gradually fading continuous background of the potassium spec
trum. These new lines increase in brilliancy as the washing is
continued, and a number more appear in the red, yellow, and
green portions of the spectrum.
    None of these lines belong to any previously known body.
Amongst them are two which are especially remarkable, as lying
beyond Fraunhofer’s line A and the potassium line Ka coinci
dmt with     it,and therefore situated in the outermost portion of
the red solar rays.     Hence we propose for this new metal the
name Rubidium. (and the symbol Rb), from the Latin “rubidus,”
which was used to express the darkest red colour'l'.

that the productof thelast preparation is pure chlorideof rubidium.
    In order to obtain a still further proof of the purity of the
chloride thus prepared, a method was employed of which we
 shall again have to speak when discussing the mode of separa
tion of caesium from potassium and rubidium.              This consists
 in treating the three caustic alkalies with carbonic acid until
 about one-<U+FB01>fth by weight of the whole mass is converted into
 carbonates, and then extracting the anhydrous salt with alco
 hol.    If  an alkali possessing greater or less basic properties
 than rubidium, and having a different atomic weight, were
 present together with this metal, the alcoholic solution must
 possess a composition differing from that of the residue; the
 portion of caustic alkali which dissolved in alcohol yielded,
 however, a chloride possessing a composition identical with that
  obtained from the portion of alkali undissolvcd by the alcohol,
  0-5116 grm. of the former yielding 0-6078 grm. chloride of silver,
  or 1 part of chloride giving 1'1830 of chloride of silver, closely
  corresponding with the previous results.       If we only consider the
  precipitation of the products possessing constant composition,
  and if we take, according to Stas, the atomic weight of silver to
  be 107-94, and that of chlorine 35-46, we obtain the following
  numbers for the atomic weight of rubidium on the hydrogen
                      B. .....85'31

                       E......85'24~
  or a  mean of Rh = 85'36.       The weight of the atom of the new
  metal  is therefore  more   than twice as great as that of potassium.
  Although the numbers thus obtained do not coincide with the
  degree of accuracy which may be desirable in determinations of
  atomic weights, we believe that the mean experimental number

                Analysis by Spectrum-observations.                      333
does not differ from the true combining proportion more than is
the case with a large proportion of the atomic weights at present
considered as correct, and received without question.
   It is almost needless to add that the residues obtained by the
treatment above described, when operated upon again, yielded
a considerable quantity of chloride of rubidium.
   Although impossible to determine with exactitude the quantity
of rubidium contained in lcpidolite, it appeared of interest to
ascertain this as accurately as possible.           For this purpose a
specimen of lcpidolite was employed, found at Rozena near
Hradisko, which was seen by means of spectrum-analysis to
contain traces of caesium as well as rubidium.         The solution 0b~
tained from 13'509 grms. of this lepidolite fused with lime, was
precipitated in the usual manner with chloride of platinum, and
the precipitated double chlorides of potassium, rubidium and
platinum reduced with hydrogen, yielding 2'0963 grms. of the
chlorides of potassium and rubidium.            These salts were again
precipitated by chloride of platinum, and the precipitate thus
obtained, boiled out with small quantities of water until the
solution appeared of a light yellow colour.            The united wash
waters, on evaporation and cooling, deposited a second crop of
crystals, which were treated       :in   similar way to the <U+FB01>rst preci

time,   was  likewise  submitted   to  the   same   treatment,  and the
operation repeated until the precipitate formed, on concentrating
the wash-waters, easily dissolved on boiling in small quantity of

part of oxide of rubidium in 100 parts of the lepidolite in
question. This determination, together with an analysis of the

334          Professors Kirchhoff and Bunsen on Chemical
    We have assured ourselves in     a series  of spectrum-analytical
investigations, which we here omit, as we shall return to the
subject when discussing the properties of the caesium com
pounds, that in almost all mineral springs containing chloride
of sodium, traces of rubidium compounds accompany the salts of
potassium and sodium ; so that, although rubidium is found in
but small quantities, it is by no means a body of rare occurrence.
        II. 0f Metallic   Rubidium and   some  of its compounds.
                             a. The illetnl.
    As the total quantity of pure material which we possessed
scarcely exceeded one ounce, it would have been unwise to waste
the whole of this in one experiment upon the reduction of the metal
from the carbonate, and we therefore for the present con<U+FB01>ned
 ourselves to separating the metal by means of electrolysis.       If  a
 current be passed through fused chloride of       rubidium,  the posi
 tive pole consisting of a rod of graphite, and the negative pole
 being formed of an iron wire, the metallic rubidium, is seen to
 rise to the surface of the liquid from the latter, and burns with
 reddish colour on coming in contact with the air. When the
 iron wire is surrounded by a small glass bell through which a
 current of pure dry hydrogen is led, the metal does not burn,
 but it does not collect in the hollow bell, as it disappears as soon
 as it is liberated, uniting with the chloride to form a subchloride,
 which dissolves in the fused mass. This subchloride imparts a
 deep blue colour to the salt in the neighbourhood of the iron
 pole; and although this blue mass is perfectly transparent and
 does not exhibit, either when examined by the naked eye or with
 the microscope, any trace of a metallic substance, it decomposes
 water with evolution of hydrogen and with formation of a colour
 less solution having a strong alkaline reaction ; chloride of potas
 sium also forms, under similar circumstances, a blue subchloride.
 If  the reduction be repeated with a mixture containing an equal
 number of atoms of chlorides of calcium and rubidium at the
 temperature, almost below redness, at which this mixture fuses, a
 mass is obtained which evolves large quantities of hydrogen when
 thrown into water, and from which small grains of metal are
 thrown out, which ascending take <U+FB01>re spontaneously on coming
 into contact with the air.      The metal cannot, however, be ob
 tained in this way in suf<U+FB01>cient quantity to be properly investi
 gated.     The amalgam of rubidium can, on the contrary, be very
 easily prepared from a concentrated solution of chloride of
 rubidium when metallic mercury is used as the negative pole,
 and a platinum wire is employed as the positive pole.             The
 mercury     is thus quickly changed  into  an amalgam    of rubidium,
 which on cooling appears as a solid crystalline brittle mass of a

silver-white colour.    This amalgam decomposes water at the
ordinary temperature, absorbs oxygen from the air, becoming hot,
and being covered with a white coating of caustic hydrated oxide                                '
of rubidium.     Rubidium amalgam is strongly electro-positivc in
respect to potassium-amalgam    when a circuit is completed with
both by means of the chlorides of rubidium and potassium.
   Potassium, therefore, can no longer be considered as the most
electro-poeitive element, for in the foregoing experiment it has
been shown to be more electro-negative than rubidium.
                         b. Hydrated Ozide       of Rubidium.
   This substance is best prepared from the sulphate; the latter
salt is dissolved in 100 parts of water, and the solution boiled
for some time to free it from air; to the boiling solution hydrate
of baryta is cautiously added; the sulphate separates quickly out,
so that the oint of complete precipitation is easily and accurately
reached.      Ili'

                                      is              a
porous mass, which melts and fuses quickly almost below                   red         a

                                                                         a

mass, which does not exhibit any crystalline structure.                 This
substance     is  completely    and   quickly    volatilized  when    placed
in   a <U+FB02>ame   ; and placed in contact with water,            dissolves with
                                                                   it

The alkali cannot be evaporated in platinum vessels, as              attacks

                    0.   Monocarbonate    of Rubid-ium.
   This salt is best prepared from the sulphate of rubidium by
precipitating with baryta water, and evaporating the solution
of the caustic alkali to dryness with carbonate of ammonium.
The excess of baryta added remains behind on treating the
mass with water.        The solution yields on concentration indistinct
crystals and crystalline crusts of hydrated carbonate of rubidium,
which, on heating strongly, melt in their water of crystallization,
and leave at last a porous mass, melting at a red heat, and
solidifying on cooling to an opake white crystalline salt. The
anhydrous salt is strongly hygroscopic, and dissolves in water
with evolution of heat. It has a caustic and corrosive action
upon the skin. The alkaline reaction of the salt is so powerful
that boiled water, to which only <U+FB01>-fg<U+FB01>ths of the salt has been
added, imparts a distinct alkaline reaction to red litmus paper.
The salt is almost insoluble in boiling absolute alcohol, 100
parts of alcohol only dissolving 0'74 of the salt. \Vhen fused
in a platinum crucible, it does not lose its carbonic acid, even at
very high temperatures.           1'4632 grm. of the salt which had
been fused for some time, lost 0'2748 grm. of carbonic acid
upon treatment with sulphuric acid.           Hence the composition of
the salt is as follows    :—

    The aqueous solution of the monocarbonate is easily converted
into the acid salt when placed in contact with an atmosphere of
carbonic acid.      If the solution be allowed to evaporate at the
ordinary atmospheric temperature over sulphuric acid, the salt
forms shining crystals, permanent in the air, possessing a pris
 matic form, but of which no sample suf<U+FB01>ciently well crystallized
for exact measurement could be obtained.               The crystals give a
very slightly alkaline reaction, and they possess a cooling, non
caustic, agreeable taste, similar to that of saltpctre.       On heating,
they easily lose the second atom of carbonic acid.          They are very
 soluble in water; and the aqueous solution gives off carbonic acid
on boiling, probably owing to the formation of a scsquicarbonate.
    0'5416 gi'm. of monocarbonatc of rubidium was dissolved in
water in a weighed platinum crucible, and left for fourteen days
in an atmosphere of carbonic acid, which was slowly from time
to time renewed.         After the solution had been evaporated at the
ordinary temperature over sulphuric acid, the mass was again

  dried in the same way until no further loss of weight occurred.
 The salt then weighed 0'6878 grm. Hence it is seen that the
  bicarbonate of rubidium has a composition analogous to bicar

     This salt crystallizes from aqueous solution, when quickly
 cooled, in long indistinct crystals.         When the crystallization is
 conducted more slowly, double hexagonal prisms terminated with
 less distinct double hexagonal pyramids are obtained in a state
 <U+FB01>t for measurement. The crystals invariably incline to a prismatic
 form, and belong to the hexagonal system, corresponding to a
 ratio of the axes of

     The nitrate of potassium crystallizes, as is well known, in the
 rhombic system, but according to Frankenheim it occurs some
times as a secondary hexagonal form whose hemihedral form
 corresponds to a hexagonal dodecahedron having polar angles of
 106° 40'.     This form corresponds to a hexagonal dodecahedron
of another order than that in which nitrate of rubidium cry
stallizes; to this, however, we will recur in speaking of the nitrate
of   caesium.
    The nitrate of rubidium is anhydrous, but, like saltpetre, it
contains water enclosed in the pores of the crystals, which there
fore decrepitate on heating.             Near red heat it fuses without
decomposition to a clear liquid, and on cooling solidi<U+FB01>es to a
striated crystalline mass.           \Vhen heated to a higher point it
loses oxygen, and forms nitrite together with caustic oxide of
       * This angle served for the calculation of the ratio of the  axes.

   The acid salt having the formula RbO, 2S0a fuses like the cor
responding potassium salt near redness, and when more strongly
heated froths considerably, losing half its sulphuric acid, and
leaving a solid residue, fusible only at a white heat.     If the
aqueous   solution of this neutral salt be slowly evaporated, <U+FB01>nc

    The above numbers are the mean of a number of experiments
 which agree so well amongst themselves, that the result given
 at 13°'5 C. as the minimum of solubilit' may be regarded as
 certain.   This seems to show that at a lower temperature the
 salt contains water of crystallization.
    The bichloride of platinum in the salt loses some of its chlorine
 when a current of hydrogen is passed over it in the cold ; and the
 whole of this chlorine completely disappears when the salt is
 heated, leaving a residue of chloride of rubidium and metallic
 platinum.     For the purpose of analysing the salt, 1'9398 grin.
 of the double salt prepared from pure bichloride of platinum,
 and completely dried at 150° C., was reduced in a current of
 hydrogen, and thus lost 0'4850 grm. The chloride of rubi
 dium, obtained by extracting the residue with water, weighed
 0'7891 grm., and yielded 0'9252 grin. chloride of silver.        The
reduced platinum weighed 0'6620 grm.            Hence the composition
 of the salt is found to be—

    The somewhat considerable        deviation of the found from the
calculated   numbers is to be accounted for by the fact that the
reduction of the salt was made in a crucible with a perforated
lid, and that a small quantity of the chloride of rubidium was
thus volatilized.

   We have always found this metal associated with sodium,
potassium, and rubidium.        It occurs in the largest quantity in
the mother-liquor from the mineral water of Durkheim ; and we
                                                                         “.4

                 Analysis by Spectrum-observations.                 341
have employed this liquor as the source of the material which we
have used in the present investigation.
    The following observations served as the foundation for the
mode of separating the caesium-salts from the compounds of the
 other alkalies.
   If   the mother-liquors of the Diirkheim mineral water be freed
 from alkaline earths by the ordinary methods, so that the mass
 which remains after volatilization of the ammoniacal salts con
 sists solely of salts of the alkalies, and if the solution of these
 salts be then treated with bichloride of platinum, a yellow cry
 stalline precipitate is obtained, which, when placed in the spec
 trum-apparatus, exhibits an intense potassium reaction, but
 shows no trace of the blue lines of caesium.              If
                                                          the platinum
 precipitate be boiled out twenty times with small quantities of
 water, the successive solutions, as is the case with the rubidium
 compounds, gradually become less and less yellow-coloured.
 Examined from time to time in the spectrum-apparatus, the po
 tassium lines Ka, KB are seen to grow fainter and fainter, and
 the blue caesium lines gradually become visible on the fading
 background of the continuous potassium spectrum.           The double
 chloride of platinum and caesium is therefore, like the corre
  sponding rubidium-salt, more dit<U+FB01>cultly soluble than the chloride
 of platinum and potassium.
     In our <U+FB01>rst experiment, conducted as above described, we
  employed 5O grms. of the mother-liquor, and obtained only 1'2
  milligramme of the impure double chloride of platinum and
  caesium; still, with this minute quantity, the spectrum reaction
  was so well de<U+FB01>ned and characteristic that we did not hesitate at
  once to commence the preparation of the salts of the new metal
  on a large scale,   iriwhich 240 kilogrammes of mother-liquor,
  obtained from 44,200 kilogrammes of water, was employed.
'The dif<U+FB01>culty of working up the immense mass of raw material
  used in the preparation of the caesium-salts described in the pre
  sent memoir, was lessened      by  the kindness of Dr. Gnndelach,
  who arranged that the rougher portions of the operations should
  be conducted in an alkali-works, in the following manner.
     The mother-liquors were treated with sulphuric acid in     a   salt
  cake furnace, and the sulphates thus obtained boiled for some
  time with water containing caustic lime.        The excess of lime
  was separated from the aqueous solution        by
                                                  means of oxalic acid,
  and then the greater part of the sulphuric acid precipitated with
  nitrate of barium, whilst the last portions, together with the
  solublemagnesian salts, were removed      by the addition of hydrate
  of barium. The <U+FB01>ltered liquid, neutralized          by
                                                    nitric acid, yielded
  on evaporation  a   salt which was worked up in the Heidelberg
 laboratory.

     On treatment with strong alcohol, this mass yielded a residue
 weighing 6'5 kilogrammes, which was tolerably rich in caesium
 salts, and was subjected to a series of processes which will be
 described under the head of
                                   “ Residue No. 1.”
    To the alcoholic extract from the original mass a concentrated
 aqueous solution of carbonate of ammonium was added in order
 to precipitate the greater portion of the lithium-salts.        The solu
 tion was then evaporated to dryness in an iron vessel and heated
 to expel all ammoniacal salts, the brown mass (containing much
 oxide of iron) dissolved in water, and the aqueous solution evapo
 rated to dryness.      On extraction with alcohol, this salt yielded a
 residue which we will call
                                “ Residue No. 2,” to the treatment of
 which we shall recur.
     This second alcoholic extract gave with bichloride of platinum
 a yellow precipitate, which weighed 8'5134 grms. after washing
 with water.      The precipitate did not undergo any change of
 composition    on  boiling with water; and when it was placed in
 the spectrum-apparatus,       showed the caesium and rubidium lines
 with great intensity. It therefore consisted almost entirely of a
 mixture of the double chlorides of caesium and rubidium, and
 platinum.

These metals, however, are likewise found to be present in the
waters of the non-alkaline springs containing but small quan

salts of these two new alkalies in two of the hot springs at
Baden-Baden, namely in the Ungemach and Hollenquelle.

               Analysis by Spectrum-observations.              347
   The salts of caesium and rubidium, as well as those of lithium
and strontium, have been likewise found in the water of the
W iesbaden springs, as also in that of the newly-bored artesian
well at Soden near Frankfurt.     In order to obtain evidence of
the presence of the new alkalies in this water, it is only neces
sary to boil out the platinum precipitate     obtained from the
mother-liquor   of 6  to 8 litres of the water;  the caesium and
rubidium lines are then easily recognized in the spectrum
apparatus.
    We have examined small quantities of the ashes of land-and
sea-plants, as well as Chili saltpetre and other alkaline salts
occurring in commerce, for the compounds of the new alkaline
metals, but we have not succeeded in detecting, in these sub
stances, the presence of the salts of either metal.
    Having thus considered the occurrence and diffusion of caesium,
we pass on to the consideration of the methods of separation, by
means of which the compounds of this metal can be obtained in
a state of purity.   If, as is almost always the case, potassium,
rubidium, and caesium occur together with sodium and lithium,
the <U+FB01>rst three metals can be separated from the two latter by
means of bichloride of platinum.      The double chloride of plati
num and potassium can be separated from the platinum compound
of the two new alkaline chlorides, as has been described, by
boiling the double salts out about twenty times with small quan
tities of water; and thus the _more soluble potassium-salt may be
almost entirely removed.        The double platinum compounds,
which now contain but traces of potassium-salts, are next heated
to redness in a current of hydrogen, at which temperature the
chlorides of caesium and rubidium do not fuse.      The mass is then
treated with about seventy times its Weight of water, and the alka
line chlorides thus dissolved.     The residual platinum is again
converted into chloride, which is diluted with water to the same
bulk as the solution of the alkaline chlorides ; both solutions are
then heated to boiling and mixed together.       As soon as the pre
 cipitate which forms on mixing      the  solutions has collected in
 suf<U+FB01>cient quantit by the cooling of the liquid, it is thrown on
a <U+FB01>lter, dried, an again subjected to the same treatment of reduc
tion in hydrogen,&c., until a small portion brought into the spec
trum-apparatus shows at most a faint trace of the potassium line
 Km. The precipitate then contains solely the chlorides of caesium
and rubidium.      For the purpose of separating these two bodies,
the solubility of the carbonate of caesium in absolute alcohol, and
the insolubility of carbonate of rubidium in the same liquid, is
made use of.
    The separation of the carbonate of caesium by repeated extrac
tions with alcohol   is, however, a  dif<U+FB01>cult operation, as double
                                                          a

 348        On Chemical Analysis by Spectrum-observations.
 carbonate of rubidium and caesium appears to be formed which
 is not perfectly insoluble in alcohol.       On this account, we prefer
 to prepare the caustic alkalies by the action of baryta-water on
 the sulphates, and then to convert about one-<U+FB01>fth part of the
 mixed caustic alkalies into carbonate by evaporation with carbon
 ate of ammonium in a silver basin. The hydrated oxide of caesium
 is then dissolved out from such a mixture by alcohol, leaving a
 residue consisting of carbonate of rubidium containing caesium.
 If  this mode of separation be repeated <U+FB01>ve or six times, each
 time taking care to use as little alcohol as possible, the hydrated
 oxide of caesium is obtained quite free from rubidium, as may be
 proved by examination in the spectrum-apparatus.             It is scarcely
 necessary to remark that the numerous residues which accumu
 late in the course of the several operations must again be worked
 up in the same way as the original substance, and that the pla
 tinum can be used over and over again without any great loss.
    The following experiment served as a preliminary determi
 nation of the atomic weight of caesium.        Chloride of caesium was
 prepared   from   the  mixed  chlorides  freed from  all potassium salt,
 by the methods just described,       and   the contained     chlorine esti
 mated as chloride of silver.
    0'5219 grm. of the chloride of caesium yielded 049% grm. of
 chloride of silver.
    The chloride of caesium of the <U+FB01>rst preparation was submit
ted a second time to the purifying treatment above described.
 1'7690 grm. of the third preparation yielded 1'654-8 grm. of
chloride of silver.      This substance was again puri<U+FB01>ed in like
manner, and 03727 grm. of the third preparation yielded 0'3402
grin. chloride of silver. After the process of puri<U+FB01>cation had been
repeated for a fourth time, 1'3860 grm. of the substance yielded
 1'2518 grm. of chloride of silver.        After the <U+FB01>fth time of treat
ment, 10124       of  the salt gave 091441 grm. chloride of silver;
and lastly, after the sixth puri<U+FB01>cation, 04126 grm. of chloride
of silver was obtained from 04572 grm. of the salt.
    Hence 100 parts of the substance under examination gave—
   After the <U+FB01>rst puri<U+FB01>cation       95'708 grms. of chloride of silver.
        ,,    second       ,,       93'486                 ,,

four times with alcohol, a substance was obtained which on a
repetition of the process did not undergo any alteration in com
position.

with potassium-salts, the number 123'35 cannot be regarded as
a multiple or submultiple of the atomic weight               of caesium.

possesses the largest atomic weight of all the known elementary
bodies with the exceptions of gold and iodine.

XLIII.     Considerations   on  the Phenomena attending       the  Fall of
    Meteorites    on the   Earth.—Part I.          By W. HAIDINGER,
    For. diam. RS.    L. Q E., and Director-General of the School
    of Mines in Austria *.
           only falls of meteorites which       I  propose to take into
THEconsideration         in this paper, are those which have been
observed as accurately as possible.           Generally in such cases
dates and particulars that can be perfectly relied upon are not
common.       The phenomena taking place without warning and
occupying so short a period of time, it is only from persons
accustomed to receive impressions promptly that we can obtain
trustworthy observations.         Dr. Gustavus Sche<U+FB01>‘czik, whilst on a
hunting-excursion, saw near Strakowitz in Bohemia, on the
29th of November, 1859, at 1011 45' A.M., a luminous star-like
point appearing suddenly on a clear sky, due north 15° zenith
distancc, increasing gradually to an intensely luminous globe,
equal in size to one-third of the full moon (about one-third of
her diameter), and passing along'a parabolic path towards
 S. 60° E.     When under an angle of altitude of 25° (azimuth
 =65°) it assumed an oval shape, the pointed endbent down
wards and forwards, and lastly, apparently dissOIVed into many
large sparks, one of which evidently fell down in avertical direc
tion. Dr. Sche<U+FB02>'czik estimates the phenomenon to have lasted
from four to <U+FB01>ve seconds.         A noise as if myriads of birds were
<U+FB02>ying through the air attracted his attention.          According to his
watch, 1} minute passed in silence after the disappearance of
the luminous appearances; then followed, quickly after each
other, four detonations (the last the most intense), resembling the

discharges from heavy ordnance.         The ground shook under the
observer’s feet, as was corroborated by three other gentlemen in
company with Dr. 8., who likewise heard the four detonations.
   I  have received some other observations concerning the same
                       I
phenomenon; but consider Dr. Sche<U+FB01>'czik’s observation most
valuable, from the excellent account it gives of the <U+FB01>rst approach
of the “ star-like” luminous body, and of its subsequent pro
gression.
   Searcer any fall of aérolites has ever been so exactly and
fully observed as that which fell at New Concord, Muskingum
Co., Ohio, on May 1st, 1860*.            Professor Evans, of Marietta
College, Ohio, calculated several elements of the orbit.             The
meteor, <U+FB01>rst seen as a <U+FB01>ery globe at a horizontal distance of
20 to 30 (English) miles, appeared like the full moon.                An
altitude of 4-0 miles, derived from other observations, would give
to it a real diameter of gths of a mile.        It moved from S.E. to
N.VV. The <U+FB01>nal velocity was about 4 miles a second.               Nearly
thirty stones, of about 700 lbs. total weight, were found to have
fallen; the largest of them, weighing 103 lbs., is now in the
Museum of Marietta College.          All these stones taken together
would fall far short of the apparent size of the meteor, as is the
case with many other observations of a similar nature, especially
with that of Agram in Croatia, May 26th, 1751, where two
masses of native iron, the one of 71 lbs., the other of 16 lbs.,
were the only material residuum of a meteor whose apparent
diameter was scarcely under 3000 feet-H At <U+FB01>rst the New Con
cord stones were warm, so that particles of the moist ground on
which one of them had fallen, soon dried up, at least in the case
of one weighing 71 lbs.
    Its greatest heat was not more than that which the stone
would have had if exposed for some time to the natural heat of
the sun’s rays.      The largest of the stones (103 lbs.) was found
about three weeks after the fall, beneath the root of an oak tree.
It had gone through another root in an oblique direction, and
had penetrated to the depth of nearly 3 feet into a hard argil
laceous ground: no mention is made of its probable temperature
at the time of falling.      Those who witnessed the fall, only per
ceived that the stones were “ black,” they did not mention the
appearance of any <U+FB01>reball I.         At the moment of the fall they

                 the  Fall of Meteorites   on the Earth.               351
heard    hissing sounds, and that before the chief detonation
had attracted their attention.          All the stones were covered
with a black crust bearing evidence of fusion, and presented
angular and fragmentary shapes; their interior resembled grey
solid rocks*.     The American naturalists inferred from the col
lated accounts about the igneous globe, the acoustic phenomena,
and the fall itself, that the <U+FB01>rst and chief detonation took place
at an altitude of about 40 miles (English) above the southern
portion of Noble County, at a distance of about 30 miles from
New Concord ; and that the fall of the stones themselves com
menced about one mile S.E. of that place, extending over an
area of 10 miles in length by 2 to 3 in breadth, the largest
ones falling last.     The sound perceived was supposed to have
been explosive in its nature; and the meteor, after having ceased
to be visible, must have continued its course towards the North
west.     These are some of the most important facts relating to
the phenomenon.        Desirable as it is to pursue induction step by
step, it is impossible to give a clear exposition without sketching
previously the succession in time of each event as they are ob
served and perceived by our senses.          Nobody who has ever ex
amined meteorites with more than super<U+FB01>cial attention, can have
 doubted that their interior and their exterior present two dif
 ferent periods of formation.      The general form of meteorites is
 that of fragments, the constitution of their external crust is the
 consequence of super<U+FB01>cial fusion. They are fragments coming from
 remote cosmieal regions, which having entered the earth’s atmo
 sphere, are <U+FB01>rst perceived by us as stars, increasing in size as they
 come nearer to us.      Great care should be taken to observe and
 note the moment or time with as much exactitude as possible,
 as, combined with the time of the year and the hour of the day,
 it gives us the direction of the meteor. The direction and the
 velocity of our globe in its circum-solar orbit (19 English miles
 per second, while a point on the equator by diurnal rotation
 moves 1464'?” Vienna feet in a second, or 900 nautical miles per
 hour), are well known.
     Many observations have proved meteorites to travel 16 to 40
 English miles in a second. Humboldt, in his ‘Cosmos,’ has
 even, from the observations of J. Schmidt, Heis, and Houzeau,
 calculated a velocity of 95 miles a second.
     These orbits cross and oppose each other in every conceivable
 direction.    Important consequences may be deduced from these
 enormous velocities, as compared with what takes place on the
 surface of our globe.      A devastating hurricane takes place in
    " “ Viewed from most positions, this stone
                                               (that of 103 lbs. at Marietta
 College) is angular, and appears to have been quite recently broken from
 a larger mass.”

352              M. Haidinger on          the Phenomena attending
our atmosphere whenever an air-current is progressing at the
rate of 92 miles (English) per hour.         A point on the equator,
by  diurnal rotation  progresses  at the rate  of 1464-7 Vienna feet
per second without disturbance of the atmospheric equilibrium,
on account of the general atmospheric pressure being nearly
equal in places lying very near each other.         According to Sir
John Herschel, the movement of a “ devastating hurricane ” is
equivalent to a pressure of 37'9 lbs. Vienna (32-81 lbs. English)
weight, on one square foot Vienna measure.          The atmospheric
pressure (:32     feet  of  water)   on  one  Vienna   square foot is
18048 lbs., or, compared with that of the         most  powerful hur
ricane, as 55 to 1.

   It is the best proof in favour of the use of such extensive and
elaborate synoptic works as Prof. Schmidt’s Manual, that they
gave me complete con<U+FB01>dence in the data I had so laboriously
compiled from other sources, and this, thanks to the author’s
kind attention to me, just at the moment when         felt most in        I
want of such.
   What is the state of the single particles of air composing our
atmosphere in the elevated regions, where meteorites, <U+FB01>rst en
tering    it,are capable of producing luminous phenomena as
intense   as  observed at New Concord, even at the enormous
altitude of 40 English miles?       In these elevated regions the
temperature may probably not exceed that of the interplane
tary space,       0.

  of the atmosphere,       as    on these depend the changes of atmo
  spheric pressure nearer to the earth’s surface, the causes of the
  winds, &c. Whenever solid bodies move through them, so ab
  normal an event goes on with such enormous rapidity, that these
  particles, quite isolated from each other, must be positively
  pushed aside.       In the van of the progressing meteorite a stra
  tum of atmospheric particles is formed, having no time to escape
  before the progressing body, but by streaming back alongside of
 it. The velocity of a meteorite, supposed on an average to be
  seven German miles (24,000 feet) per second, is to that of a
 hurricane of 134-72 feet per second as 124-4 to 1. Suppose the
 pressure to increase in the same proportion, it would be per
 square foot, for the hurricane =32'8 lbs., and for the meteorite
 4080'32 lbs., or more than 22 atmospheres.
     It may be supposed that such a sudden compression (action
 and reaction continually remaining equal) must have the same.
 effect as the compression of air in the old tinder-boxes alluded
 to by Prof. Benzenberg.            It might not here be out of place to
 quote in extemo a passage from a book published <U+FB01>fty years
 ago“, expounding views still far from being cleared up :—
     “ The incandescencc perceived around <U+FB01>reballs in a state of
 ignition may be the result either of combustion, although with
 dif<U+FB01>culty admissible in air so very rare<U+FB01>ed, or of friction, as gene
 rally believed.     I  think it results still more from the compression
 of air, as in our newly invented tinder-boxes air produces <U+FB01>re by
 mere compression.         Could not electricity become free in the same
 way? Suppose a cubic mile of air to he suddenly compressed
 to a volume of one cubic foot, would not then the electricity
 originally contained in it be set at liberty? The circumstances
 attending the explosion of igneous globes seem to be in accord
 ance with this supp0sition.             These globes, when <U+FB01>rst seen, do
 not appear larger than bright stars; as they approach the ter
 restrial surface (generally in an oblique direction) they increase
to the size of the full moon, and at last, when at a few miles
 distant, explode with a violent detonation.               The cause of this
explosion     is probably    an  excessive   accumulation   of electric matter,
streaming      from  compressed       air  into the  igneous globe of about
3000 feet in size of (I?) metallic substance.             The distance being
still too considerable to admit of a discharge to the earth, this
takes place in the open air, or within a cloud.
    “Probably the place of the discharge depends less on the
proximity of the terrestrial surface than on the density of air rc
gulating the maximum of compression and accumulation of elec
tricity.     Subsequently       to the explosion, the single fragments

354!          M. Haidinger   on the Phenomena attending
fall to the surface of the earth, with a velocity probably inferior
to that of a bullet shot from a gun, the air increasing in density
as it becomes nearer the surface of the globe, resistance in
creasing proportionally, so that there may be but a slight differ
ence in the <U+FB01>nal velocity, whether the body fall from a height of
one or of <U+FB01>ve miles.”
   I  have here quoted views somewhat opposed to those which          I
myself intend to propose (as those relating to the explanation of
the explosion of <U+FB01>reballs); yet some of the above-quoted assertions
may perhaps be worth further consideration.
    The following exposition of the way in which this may occur
may not be altogether devoid of probability.         Compression, <U+FB01>rst
 of all, developcs heat and light.        Immediately in front of the
 meteorite   is formed  a centre  of expansion, from which the eom~
 pressed air tends to expand in every direction.          Whatever lies
 in the direction of the orbit, is left in the rear of the progressing
 meteorite; whatever lies opposite to      it,contributes to the fusion
 of the super<U+FB01>cial crust, or     by  its resistance either retards its
 progress, or gives rise to  a   rotatory movement around an axis
 coinciding with the meteorite’s orbit, even       if
                                                    it  should have un
 dergone   such a  motion  only  on  entering  the  terrestrial orbit.
                                                                     A
 part of the air made luminous        by compression,    isforced out as
 atC,   in every direction perpendicularly to the orbit AB (<U+FB01>g. 1).
 Resistance continues against this luminous disc, forces      it    back
wards, overcomes    it

   Instances of two or more luminous bodies behind each other
have been observed, as those seen at Elmira, Long Island, United
States, July 20, 1860; at Littau in Moravia, end of August 1848
or 1849   5 at Collioure in France, February 21st, 1846.      In
these cases we may suppose that the single <U+FB01>reball <U+FB01>rst seen
contained   already     certain number of fragments, acted upon
                         a

ences in size, shape, and perhaps speci<U+FB01>c gravity, so that the

heavier among them found less obstruction in pursuing their way
than the lighter ones.
   M. Julius Schmidt observed at Athens, July 27th, 1859, a
magni<U+FB01>cent    green meteor, moving slowly in twelve seconds
through an arc of 28°, commencing with a faint light, and end
ing as faintly, while about the middle of its course it expanded
into a ball of 8—10 minutes in diameter, casting an intense
light over the whole town and neighbouring hills.
   An orbit having its convexity turned towards the earth’s sur
face, as that of the meteor of 20th July, 1860, seen in the United
States, may be indicative of a degree of speci<U+FB01>c gravity inferior
to that generally the case in meteorites.    In this case the mo
tion of meteorites may become slower and slower, and at last
he completely stopped; while there is little chance of their again
returning into the cosmical space, from whence they entered our
atmosphere.
   The meteorite in question evidently entered the more rare<U+FB01>ed
strata of the atmosphere, and, perhaps in<U+FB02>uenced by the short
duration of the igneous globe surrounding                       it,
                                                     continued on its
course into space.     Its speed, though somewhat diminished, was
certainly not annihilated.
   Hitherto we have left out of consideration the altitude of the
atmospheric     strata in which      meteor

nor  is this omission objectionable: suppose the meteorite moved
along c10se to the surface of the earth under the pressure of                     a
whole atmosphere, answering to          column of mercury 30 inches

in height, and at the rate of seven miles per second,        would act     it
on every square foot of resisting air with      pressure of 22 atmo

             ;
at  aheight of between 18,000 and 19,000 feet, where the baro
meter would indicate an atmospheric pressure of only 15 inches.
It must, however, not be lost sight of, that under such circum
stances the resistance of the surrounding air            also notably is
diminished, and      that   consequently   the atmospheric particles

 my observations have con<U+FB01>rmed me in this persuasion.             But
how is electricity acting here on the gaseous particles? In my
opinion only as an exciter of heat.     The gaseous particles become
incandescent.      The thick glass in the narrower portion of the
 Geisslerian tube is very notably heated when the discharge from
 Ruhmkorf'f’s apparatus passes through the gas contained in it.
If, then, the heat transmitted to the glass from the dispersed
gaseous particles, whose tension is often measurable by fractions
of millimetres, increases to a notable degree, to whats. degree
of intensity must these particles be heated l”

    Terrestrial attraction is quite an insigni<U+FB01>cant element com
pared to the planetary or cosmical impulsion peculiar to any
meteorite; and but for the resistance offered by the atmosphere,
few or no meteorites would reach the surface of our earth, except
those whose orbits were directly aimed towards it.
    Meteoric stones after falling appear black; and their ena
melled crust proves them to have undergone super<U+FB01>cial fusion
from exposure to high temperature.       Their interior is frequently
not more heated than would permit of their being held in the
hand without inconvenience.
    This is no matter for surprise, as the stone having quite re
cently come from the cold regions of interplanetary space, a
compensation may be supposed to take place between the out
side and the inside.

1861), probably from the extreme cold of the interior, showed,
at the moment of their fall, a temperature notably below con
gelation*.          Mcteoric iron, however, being a good conductor of
heat, comes down far more heated, and even in a state of in
tense incandescence, as was the case with the iron of Corrientes
in Caritas Paso, near the river Mocorita, in January 1844, men
tioned by Mr. Greg-f, which fell at 2 A.M. in the shape of
a lengthened globe, a <U+FB01>ery streak marking its passage through
the air.         The mass fell down at a distance of about 1200 feet
from Mr. Symonds, who indeed <U+FB01>rst made known this fall. Later
in the morning it could not be approached nearer than ten or
twelve yards, on account of the heat emanating from the mass,
which projected several feet out of the ground. During the fall
the atmosphere was evidently in a state of motion, as if repelled
by the falling body, producing a whirlwind of short duration.
    This description is quite consistent with the facts to be derived
from the preceding considerations.                    In this case the meteoric
iron-mass struck the earth nearly point blank, falling under an
acute angle of 60°.
    Another very characteristic phenomenon connected with the
vanishing of meteoric light, is the accompaniment of intense ex
plosive sound, resembling the ignition of gunpowder <U+FB01>red from
guns or mines.                Generally one detonation is strikingly loud,
frequently followed by others of a “rattling” character.                                   The
             “ explodes,” as it is

it one or more stones, disproportionally small in quantity as
compared with‘the probable size of the <U+FB01>reball itself.
    What could then have become of a body so luminous as that
of a large meteor, which, according to Prof. Laurence Smith’s
experiments, might indeed appear far larger than the solid matter
contained in it could justify one in supposing possible?
     According to Prof. Smith’s experiments—made, 1st, with the
electric light between carbon points 3 2nd, with the oxy-hydrogen
light falling on lime ; and 3rd, with the light from steel burning
in oxygen,—the irradiation of a luminous point gives the follow

358            M. Haidinger on        the Phenomena attending
inclined to overrate the size of an object, the reports or accounts
of <U+FB01>reballs bowing a half or the whole of the full-moon’s dia
meter, when seen from a distance of 20, 40, 60, or 100 miles,
cannot, however, entirely rest on self-delusion*.               A large space
may    be  occupied   by   the  igneous   globe,  surrounding    a far smaller
nucleus, consisting       of  one  or  more   fragments.
    On coming with enormous velocity from planetary space into
our atmosphere, the acoustic phenomenon may be accounted for
by supposing that the <U+FB01>reball includes, as we have attempted to
explain, a real vacuum maintained by the resistance of the atmo
sphere against it.        The original velocity having at length been
 suf<U+FB01>ciently retarded by the air, the meteor becomes almost sta
tionary; at this moment the vacuum suddenly collapses in the
 already rather dense air, and detonation ensues from reper
 cussion of the air <U+FB01>lling up the vacuum.              The intensity of the
 sound ceases to be a matter of wonder when we consider the
 explosions caused by setting <U+FB01>re to bubbles <U+FB01>lled with oxy-hy
 drogen gas suspended in the air.                The so-called “consecutive
 exp10sions,” or series of smaller detonations, may depend on the
more or less gradual diminution of the cosmical velocity'l'.
     Hitherto only one solid body has come into question.                When,
 however,     meteorites    arrive  in   <U+FB02>ocks or groups, as when 3000
 stones (the largest 17 lbs.) fell from a detonating meteor at
 L’Aigle in France, on the 26th of April, 1803, nearly 200 at Stan
 nern in Moravia, 22nd May, 1808, and some 30 or 40 near New
 Concord, Ohio, on May 1st, 1860, it may be supposed that even
 if one principal explosion “ had commenced the action,” subse
 quent detonations of the several isolated portions could likewise
 have taken place.        I  do not, however, believe that in the above
    * The meteor of Feb. 11, 1850, seen in England at a distance subse
 quently calculated at 50 miles, appeared, as at Hartwell, as large as the full
 moon; at places 100 miles distant from its vertical passage, as large as
 Venus.     That of July 20, 1860, seen in the United States, had a decided
 apparent diameter nearly equal to that of the full moon, when at a height
 of 41 miles. That of October 18, 1783, at a height of 60 miles, over Lin
 colnshirc, presented a similar appearance—R. P. G.
    1' It may be here fair to mention that Mr. Benj. W. Marsh, of the United
 States, considers (in his Report in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, on
 the daylight meteor of Nov. 15, 1959, seen in New Jersey) that the aérolitic
 detonation arises from a series of dccrepitations caused by the sudden expan
 sion of the surface of the stony fragment, the whole time of <U+FB02>ight not being
 sufficient to penetrate the mass.    At the forward and these ex )losions would
 take place under great pressure, which might account for t e loudness of
 the sound.     The force of these explbsions, directed backwards, would like
 wise tend to check the forward velocity of the mass.         He also considers
 that the audible cxploaion, often lasting several minutes, is the result of the
 actual bursting of the meteor; for though the explosion might only occupy
 in reality half a second of time, yet in that interval the noise might be
 distributed over a distance of twenty or thirty miles—R. P. G.

                   the   Fall of Meteorites    on the   Earth.            359
cited instances the stones were formed by the bursting or explo
sion of one large stone, but that they actually entered the atmo
sphere as a group or swarm of separate individuals, surrounded,
as I  have ventured to suggest, by what appears to us the lumi
nous <U+FB01>reball*.       Imust here shortly allude to some peculiarities
common both to stone and iron meteorites. One is the “pitted”
or indented appearance usually presented on their surfaces. This
“pitted” surface is particularly evident on the meteoric stone
of Gross-Divina, which fell July 24th, 1837, in Hungary; and
in the meteoric iron of Nebraska (Transactions of the Acad. of
Sciences of St. Louis, vol. i. no. 4, plate 21).       They are best
developed   on  the  side supposed  to have  lain backwards   (see Fin
<U+FB01>g. 1).   The  side turned  towards C  is constantly more uneven and
rough, as though it had pressed against a homogeneous mass of
air, while air-currents may, like pointed <U+FB02>ames, turn alternately
towards the plane F. Marginal seams, as on the stones of Stan
nern, owing to the fusibility of the crust, give place to similar
conjectures.     As for the general form, the centre of gravity must
have been in the forepart or front, as long as the meteorite was
moving through space. When rotation round an axis had once
 commenced, and become accelerated in consequence of the pro
 pulsory movement diminishing, the point next in gravity must
 have taken its place in the plane of rotation, so that an iron mass
 of a <U+FB02>at form, as that of Agram         is,
                                          could be propelled lying on
 its <U+FB02>at side. This iron      indeed of very different aspect on each
                              is
 of its broader planes the rougher of them was certainly directed
                          ;
 forward, as long as propulsion continued, the smoother surface
 remained turned backward, and not acted upon              by
                                                       external agents.
 The <U+FB02>at shape of the whole characterizes the Agram iron as having
 originally <U+FB01>lled up vein-like narrow cavity.

than that caused by the sudden collapse of the vacuum within a
large <U+FB01>reball.
   I  have left unnoticed many other particulars concerning this
class of phenomena, as well as attempts at explanations,          and
the views of others respecting them; and I even abstain from
mentioning their connexion with M. Coulvier-Gravier’s long
continued and accurate investigations.                  I
                                            Meantime have received
through the editor’s particular kindness, a copy of Dr. Laurence
Smith’s paper on the late fall of stones at New Concord, before
referred to in this paper, and published in Prof. Silliman’s
American Journal (Jan. 1861, vol. xxxi. p. 87). In a letter
addressed to me, Dr. Smith, for a long time a most careful in
vestigator of meteorites, writes as follows :-—-“ The method
hitherto used in studying meteorites is still very de<U+FB01>cient.       To
obtain tolerably    accurate  notions   concerning   their nature and
origin, it would be necessary to submit to stricter criticism than
is generally done the phenomena attending their fall, together
with their physical properties, mineralogical as well as chemical.
We have no right to speak of the explosion of large bodies within
our atmosphere, while the so-called fragments of them show no
marks of any explosion; nor should we speak of super<U+FB01>cial
heating to fusion in our atmosphere, while masses of 50 lbs.
weight were found, ten m'mutes after their fall, not warmer than
any stone exposed to the sun’s rays, while others fell on dry
leaves without leaving on them any traces of combustion or
heating. So I could point out several other erroneous views
relative to the fall of meteorites, and fully refuted by the che
mical and physical facts proved by the stones themselves, and
about which my account of the Ohio fall in Silliman’s Journal
is to give some hints.”
   I  have overcome,    I  believe, this di<U+FB02>iculty by placing in the
<U+FB01>rst period, viz. that of cosmical motion within the atmosphere,
the formation of the crust by super<U+FB01>cial fusion, and in the
second period (that of telluric motion, or simple falling to the
earth) the compensation between the internal and external tem
peratures.     At all events,I may feel satis<U+FB01>ed to see my own
views to some extent corroborated by the independent assent of
          distinguished and competent observer as Prof. Laurence
  mit 1p.
ssuch
    Particles separated from the surface of meteorites, appearing
perhaps to observers in the shape of sparks, may again be covered
with a thinner crust, and belong to a later but still cosmical
portion of the orbit, as B C (<U+FB01>g. 2).

               case.    At all events, observations on such fugitive phenomena
               require an uncommon amount of manifold circumspection.
                   Professor Laurence Smith concludes his above highly import
               ant memoir with the following propositions :—
                   lst. “ The luminous phenomena attending the appearance of
               meteorites are not caused           by

               tricity, or some other agent.
                  2nd. “ The sound comes not from the exPlosion of any solid
               body, but rather from concussion caused                by

               through the atmosphere, partly also from electric discharge.
                  3rd. “ Meteoric showers owe not their existence to fragments
               caused   by the rupture of   single solid body, but to the division
                                             a

                  4th. “ The black crust         not of atmospheric origin, but
                                                   is                                         is
               already formed in cosmieal space, before the meteorites enter our

are found most frequently may perhaps not be entirely devoid of
interest.
   Green and Blue Silicates.—The Chilian miners frequently
meet with veins of hard blue or green mineral, which they term
Llanca, consisting, with the exception of small quantities of lime,
alumina, and oxide of iron, entirely of oxide of copper, silicic
acid, and water.         The following is the composition of one of
these llancas, which was found coating thin veins of suboxide of
copper and the native metal, in the mines of Andacollo, Chile;
the analysis was made by M. Domeyko :—

copper, having a pure turquoise-blue colour, with little or no
shade of green, perfectly amorphous and opake, and which
appears, as the analysis will show, to have a far more de<U+FB01>nite

    Black Silicate of Copper—This mineral is of a dense black
colour, of compact structure, conchoidal fracture with a glassy
lustre, very much resembling obsidian.                                 Before the blowpipe it
does not change colour, and only fuses round the edges with
dif<U+FB01>culty.     It gives off water when heated, and is easily attacked
by hydrochloric acid. This silicate is found in some few mines
in Chile, particularly those of the Higuera in the province of
Coqnimbo, and always in very narrow veins, which are generally
found associated with the red oxide of copper, and the blue and
green silicates.       An analysis by Domeyko gave the following
numbers    :—

    In the year 1858         I  published a short account of a double
silicate of copper and manganese in the Chemical Gazette.                                     The
mineral, which      in  an  impure         state        is  found         in considerable   abun

     It may be mentioned that these silicates are, under certain
 circumstances, very advantageous to the smelter, especially when
 he has to operate upon highly ferruginous ores, by combining
 with the oxide of iron, and thus saving the sides of the furnace,
 which would otherwise be much injured.                                                  None of them contain
 either antimony or arsenic; and the copper therefore, after the
 necessary fusions, is exceedingly pure.

the prism are there refracted, and a portion of them pass down
another telescope, and are brought to the vertical wire of its eye
piece.   By moving either the telescope by which the rays are
viewed, or the position of the prism, all the different lines of
the spectrum can be seen in succession.        In the <U+FB01>rst case the
changes in the refrangibility of the rays and the requisite angular
motion of the telescope are nearly proportional; in the second
case, in which the prism is moved, it will be found that the
angular changes in the position of the prism are by no means
proportional to the changes in the indices of refraction of the
rays corresponding to those positions.
   The following investigation arose from a suggestion I made in
the summer to Mr. Becker, that the readings on the graduated
arc should be either the refractive indices of the lines corre
sponding, or should give the principal lines of the solar spectrum.
Mr. Becker then requested me to examine how the scale might

index from one end of the scale to the other, while the eye is
applied to the telescope.      The spectrum will then be seen to
move with varying velocity.       It will seem at <U+FB01>rst to more fast,
and then gradually to diminish in velocity till the middle of the
scale is reached, when it will be for the moment stationary,
and then begin to move slowly in the same direction as before
and with ever-increasing velocity till the end of the scale is
reached.      This also accounts for a fact which every one who has
used the instrument must have observed, viz. the great prepon
derance of green in the spectrum thrown by the sun or common
gaslight. It is obvious that the knowledge of these results gives
a method of magnifying any portion of the spectrum, and of de
termining its limits with greater accuracy.
        XLVI.     On the most advantageous Form     of Magnets.

      HE    further the science of magnetism advances in its deve
         lopment, the more important becomes the decision of the
question what form should be given to the magnets in order to ob
 tain the most advantageous e<U+FB02>‘cct.     If we at present con<U+FB01>ne our
 selves to those magnets which have been employed in the in
 vestigation of the magnetism of the earth, we <U+FB01>nd that by some
 observers very acute sharp-pointed needles, by others <U+FB02>at pris
 matic needles, have been pronounced to be the best adapted to
 the purpose; solid or hollow cylinders also have been recom
 mended.      I am not aware, however, that experiments of a dis
 criminating character have as yet been carried out ; nor, so far
 as  I  know, have even the principles been established accord
 ing to which the preference of one form over the others is to be
 determined.     Nevertheless, as regards the latter point, a nearer
 consideration will show that scarcely an uncertainty or difference
 of opinion can exist, as there are in general only three subjects
 of observation which come into consideration in magnets, and it
 cannot be doubtful in what relations to the result these determi
 nations stand.
    The three determinations here referred to are—the magnetic
 moment, the weight or the mass, and the moment of inertia; and
 that form is to be recognized as the most advantageous, in which
 are united the greatest possible magnetic moment, with the
  smallest possible mass, and the smallest possible moment of
 inertia.

the magnets, would consist in procuring hardened steel bars of
different forms, magnetizing them to saturation, and investiga
ting by measurement for every form the above-mentioned deter
minations. By this method           I  have instituted di<U+FB02>'erent experi
ments, but have given to them no great extension, because                   I
have found another way which attains the desired end more
simply and more surely.
    A magnet is composed of magnetic molecules.                It the mole
cules were separated, it would appear that every molecule forms
a small magnet with a determinate quantity of positive and ne
gative magnetism ; and this is what 1 denote by independent mag
netism.      As soon as the molecules are put together, each induces
in the rest new magnetism, and to the independent magnetism
of each molecule there is added a more or less considerable
quantity of induced magnetism, according to the situation which
the molecule occupies in the magnet.
    The whole effect of a magnet is regulated by the independent
and induced magnetism of the molecules.                                       '
   A magnet is than magnetized to saturation when every mole-
cule possesses the greatest possible independent magnetism ; from
which of course it follows that in a bar magnetized to saturation
all the molecules have equal independent magnetism.
    Now if we introduce a soft iron core of tolerable length into
a   very long spiral, through which a galvanic current passes,
it is known that the same magnetizing force is exerted upon
every molecule of the iron core ; that is to say, equal independent
magnetism is imparted to each molecule, and the mutual induc
tion of the molecules comes then into operation as in the molc_
cules of a. magnet.        From this it results that the distribution of
the magnetism in an iron core placed within a long spiral, and
that in a magnet which is magnetized to saturation, will be the
same ; and the laws under the limitations above-mentioned can be
determined quite as well by iron cores as by magnets.               But b
substitution of iron cores, the great advantage is obtained, that the
investigation is not only more easily executed, but also the dis
turbing in<U+FB02>uences which arise from the unequal or dispropom
tionate hardness of different bars, and the consequent uncer
tainty whether, in the magnetizing, the point of saturation* is
really reached, totally disappear.
   *  If a needle is rubbed with a pair of magnetic bars which are somewhat
larger than the needle itself, and this rubbing is continued till the needle
no longer receives additional magnetism, it is said to be

saturation,” although it is not proved whether a far greater magnetism
might not be imparted by more powerful instrumental means. On the
ma nitude of the means which is required to communicate the maximum
of orce, no satisfactory investigations have hitherto been instituted; and

            how little foundation there           is   for the ordinary opinions may be seen from
            the following statement.
               In the mechanical workshop of the observatory of this city are two
            magnetizing apparatus, of which the one consists of two 25-p0und bars,
            and the other      an electro-magnetic apparatus of great energy.
                                is                                             Amongst
            the experiments which were carried out to prove the relation of the two
            apparatus appears the following case.
               Two prismatic magnets, length 56""0 and 56""6, breadth 6""8 and 4""9,
            thickness l""5 and l""0, perfectly hard, were magnetized with the 25-pound
            bars, and the magnetic moment was determined by means of the devia
            tion, whereby     obtained—
                                I
                       Greater Magnet, deviation ......116'3 scale-divisions.
                       Smaller Magnet, deviation .... .. 81‘7 scale-divisions.
            Afterwards, when the two needles had been magnetized by means of the
            electro-magnetic apparatus. there resulted—
                       Greater Magnet, deviation .... ..177'8 scale-divisions.
                       Smaller Magnet, deviation .... ..112'4 scale-divisions.
            From this we see that the magnetizing by the 25-pound bars, in regard to
            the degree of saturation, was de<U+FB01>cient, in the greater magnet by somewhat
            more, and in the smaller by somewhat less, than       third part.  a

    The mass is here, as well as in the following series of expe
 riments, determined by means of the balance, not deduced from
 the dimensions above given, which are only approximate.
    The most disadvantageous forms are the prism with square
 section and the cylinder, in which the mass is collected as much
 as possible about the axis of the <U+FB01>gure, while, on the other hand,
the greater widening of the mass in the other forms apppears to
possess considerable advantage.
    2nd Series of E.17wrimenls.-Twclve equal laminae of iron

so managed that <U+FB01>rst a single one, then two, three, &c. laid
together, or rather joined together, were brought into the above
mentioned spiral.            When the twelve laminae were laid together,
they  formed  a   prism      of equal magnitude with C in the <U+FB01>rst series of
experiments, and had a weight of 94-8 grms. The results were,—

    Here is shown in a striking manner how disadvantageous it is
to increase the thickness.
   As a deduction from the results given above, 144 parallelo
grams would, according to the weight, be equal to the prism C
(Series of Experiments 1), and the whole magnetism of the same
would have amounted to 6874 ; but a double comparison gave
7'194~—without doubt a consequence of this, that the parallelo
grams had been covered in the heating with tinder [Zunder].

From this it is dedueiblc that the augmentation of _the breadth is
also to be considered as disadvantageous, but in a more tri<U+FB02>ing
proportion than we have found that of the thickness in the
second series of experiments.

shows distinctly that the pointing of the ends of the magnets is
not advantageous, except when the diminution of the breadth

   A  practical inference results from the preceding investigation,
 which   I believe deserves to be carefully considered on the part
of those who concern themselves with the manufacture of mag
netic instruments. A freely moveable magnet is to be employed
with advantage only so far as the magnetic moment is as large
as possible in proportion to the weight. But the more the trans~
verse size is augmented, the greater is the departure from the
ful<U+FB01>lment of this condition, and consequently the use of massive
magnetic bars must be pronounced inadmissible.                 There is only
one means of obtaining great magnetic strength with tri<U+FB02>ing
weight ; namely, by <U+FB01>rmly connecting several thin and <U+FB02>at mag
nets near or upon one another in one system without their
touching each other.          Many years ago      I  began in magnetic
variation-instruments, later also in magnetic theodolites, to unite
several magnets; and at present           I  use universally systems of
three laminae, which are laid upon each other and held separated
in the middle by small pieces of brass of about the thickness of
three-quarters of a line. Also in ships' compasses several needles
near each other are at present continually used with the best
result.     Hollow cylindrical magnets, to which some artists have
given a great preference in regard to strength and lightness,
remain, as can be proved even from theoretical considerations,
very far behind in comparison with a single <U+FB02>at needle; and
with this agree also the experiments which          I  have made.

published papers, have       Imade due reference to your estimable
researches on Solar Radiation.       I have been for some time expe

the mixture of oxygen and nitrogen which forms the body of our
atmosphere,     is,as regards the transmission of radiant heat,                     a.
practical vacuum.       The results from which the opacity of air
has been inferred are all to be ascribed to the extraneous matters
diffused in the atmosphere, and mainly to the aqueous vapour.
The negative results recently obtained              by

the air, was represented         by

its foreign constituents on the day in question was certainly
sixty-seven times that of the atmosphere itself; while the aqueous
vapour alone exerted an action at least forty times that of the air.
 I    have also to communicate to you some results of lunar
radiation which connect themselves with your speculations.           On

concurrent experiments,      Iwas compelled to infer that my thermo

when turned to any other portion of the heavens of the same
altitude.    The effect was equivalent to      radiation of cold from

        I  was going to add “into space ;” but the expression might lead to
  misapprehension.       My experiments indicate that the absorption of water
  is a molecular phenomenon.         if we suppose the aqueous vapour of the
  atmosphere to be condensed to a liquid shell enveloping the earth, the ex
  periments of Melloni would lead us to conclude that such a shell would
  completely intercept the obscure terrestrial rays.        And if the vapour be
  equally              our atmosphere would prevent the direct transmission of
            energetic,
  the obscure     eat of the earth into space.     On this point, however, I Wish

 arrangements) the number of substitutions of n elements capable
 of being expressed by the product of r cyclical substitutions. As,
 for instance, the number ofsubstitutions of four elements a, [1,0, d
 capable of expression by the product of tWO cyclical substitutions

   such representable by the product of an even number of cyclical substitu-v

   two theorems is intimately allied with Mr. Cayley’s celebrated theorem on
   “ skew,” or what, for good reasons hereafter to be alleged,                  I  should prefer
   to cull polar determinants, viz. that every such of the 2nth order is the

of opposite planes separately.         A cone can in general be drawn
through     the two  circles  of intersection, and the truncated por
tion of any four-sided pyramid inscribed in this cone will give
an inscribed hexahcdron in the sphere.            Moreover, if a. qua
drangle be inscribedin one of the circles, as ABCD, and a plane
be drawn through AB cutting the other circle in ab, and then two
more planes be drawn through the points aAD and bBC cutting
the second circle in ed respectively, it will be seen that the qua
drangle CDcd will not be plane unless—
   (a) The plane ABab, and hence the three others, pass through
         the vertex of the cone, or
   (,8) Either pair of lines AB and CD or AC and BD be par
         allel to one another and perpendicular to the common
         diametral plane of the cone and sphere.
   (a)  is the general case, and the hexahedron is a frustum of a
quadrangular pyramid. By considering in like manner the
other two pairs of planes, it will be seen that the hexahedron is
the common frustum of three four-sided pyramids.
   (,6) is the singular case of a four-sided prism, the two sections
being equally inclined, but in opposite directions.        Note: that
this prism will not in general be inscribed in a right cylinder.
   2. In the general case it obviously follows that the hexahedron
has six diagonal planes, passing two by two through the three
vertices of the pyramids.
   3. The four diagonal lines of the hexahedron intersect in a
point.     This follows, in the general case, from their lying two
by two on the six diagonal planes, and it is easily seen in the
singular case.
   4. Hence in both cases there are six diagonal planes, all inter
secting in a point.
   5. This point is the spherical pole to the plane passing through
the three vertices.       In the singular ease the polar plane passes
through the parallel lines of intersection. This property may
be deduced from the similar one of plane quadrilaterals inscribed
in   a circle.
   6. Since the sections of the cone by the planes ABCD, abcd
are subcontrary, the corresponding angles A0, 13]), Ge, 8:0. are
equal each to each.     Hence the sum of the oppos1te angles
BAD and bed is equal to two right angles, and so of similarly
opposite pairs. This is not, in general, true of the singular case.
   7. Since six planes intersect two by two in <U+FB01>fteen lines, every
hexahedron must have, associated with     it, three external lines of
intersection.
   (a) If these three associated lines lie in one plane, they must
intersect in three points, and then the hexahedron will have six
diagonal planes and four diagonal lines all intersecting in one

point. This species may be considered as formed by the planes
of two tetrahedra having a common base.
   (1)) If those three lines intersect in two points, but do not lie
in the same plane, there will in general be four diagonal planes
only, and the four linear diagonals will intersect in four points
not in the same plane.
   (6)  If only two of the three lines intersect, there will in
general be only two diagonal planes, upon each of which one
pair only of diagonal lines will intersect.
   (d) Lastly,
                   ifnone of the three lines meet, there will in
general be no diagonal planes, and the four diagonal lines will
not meet.
   Each of these four species may, however, have singular cases.
   8. In species (a) all parallel or subcontrary planes, which
divide or cleave the hexahedron into two other hexahcdra, have
similar quadrilaterals traced upon them.         In the other three
species  this is  only true, in general, of selected planes.  In the
singular case of the inscribed tetrahedron, the quadrilaterals ob»
taincd   by parallel cleavage are not always similar.
   9. The hexahedron inscribed in the sphere belongs         general,  in
as has been seen, to species (0).               Its two tetrahedra have the
corresponding plane angles at their vertices supplementary each
to those of the other.   The singular case         very restricted
                                                         is   a
singular form of species (c), or   may   be
                                        it  looked upon as an in~
determinate form, arising out of singularity, in species (a)      e.         ;   i.
that when two of the three associated lines are parallel, the third
may leave their plane, under certain conditions of symmetry.

that pupils of average intelligence rapidly acquire a knowledge of

    Among the several products of transformation into which the bro
 mide of bromethyl-triethylphosphonium           is converted when submitted
 to the action of reagents, the substances formed by its union with
 bodies similar to ammonia, have hitherto almost exclusively occupied
my attention.        I  have, however, of late examined a variety of other
 changes of this body, which deserve to be noticed.
    When heated, the bromide begins to evolve hydrobromic acid at a
temperature of about 200°, which continues for a considerable length
of time. The product of this reaction is evidently the bromide of
vinyl-triethylphosphonium,

since the temperature at which the last portion of hy robromic acid
is eliminated closely approximates the degree of heat at which the
 vinyl-body is entirely destroyed ; and since the latter compound may
 be obtained with the greatest facility by other processes*, I have
not followed up any further this direction of the inquiry.

     It seemed worth while to try whether the bromide of brom
ethylated triethylphosphonium was capable of <U+FB01>xing a molecule of
phosphoretted hydrogen.              It was found, however, that the two
bodies do not act upon one another.                 Phosphoretted hydrogen gas,
passed through the alcoholic solution of the bromide, either cold or
boiling, did not seem to affect it in any way.

 The sparingly soluble iodide is present in proportionally small quan
 tity only among the products of the action of di-iodide of methylene
 on triethylphosph'ine.      I have in vain endeavoured to detect among
 these products anything of the nature of a diphosphonium-corn
 pound.     On treating the mother-liquor of the sparingly soluble
 iodide with chloride of silver, and the dilute <U+FB01>ltered solution with
 dichloride of platinum, a few needles of the iodated platinum-salt
 are still deposited; but after considerable evaporation the solution
yields crystals, all of which exhibit an octahedral habitus.           I was
e   ually unsuccessful in a particular experiment, in which I subjected
di-iodide of methylene        to the action of a large excess of triethyl
phosphine; and a similar report must be made of the attempt to
produce the desired body by treating the ready prepared iodide with
triethylphosphine, according to the equation

    The examination of the mother-liquor           of the sparingly soluble
iodide is a di<U+FB01>icult and thankless proceeding; nevertheless, by a suf<U+FB01>
cient number of iodine- and platinum-determinations, it may be shown
to be a mixture of four di<U+FB02>'erent compounds.           The mother-liquor is
thus found to contain, together with the hydriodate of the phos
phorus-base, two crystallizable iodides differing in solubility, and to be
separated from one another only by a great number of crystallizations.
    The more soluble salt is the iodide of oxymethylated triethyl
phosphonium,       corresponding to the iodomethylated compound;
the less soluble salt is the iodide of methyl-triethylphosphonium.
The last mother-liquors contain considerable quantities of oxide of

              Iodide of Oxymethyl-trietltyhrltospltonium.
    This salt is extremely soluble both in water and in alcohol, even
in absolute alcohol, and crystallizes only after the alcohol has been
completely evaporated.         The crystals, resembling the frosty e<U+FB01>lores

The iodide, treated with oxide of silver, is converted into the corre
sponding caustic oxide, which, when mixed with hydrochloric acid
and dichloride of platinum, yields a rather easily soluble platinum
salt of an octahedral habitus.
                Iodide of liIet/tyl-trietlzylphosplionium.
    The nature of the less soluble iodide was determined byan iodine
determination, and by the analysis of the platinum-salt.          The iodide
dissolves in water and in alcohol, but is insoluble in ether. By adding
ether to the alcoholic solution, tolerable crystals are obtained. This
compound is most conveniently puri<U+FB01>ed by precipitating the alcoholic
mother-liquor, after freeing it by crystallization as far as possible
from the iodomethylated iodide, with a quantity of ether insuf<U+FB01>cient
to precipitate the whole, so that the greater part of the iodides may
remain in solution.                                                     7

the products formed in this reaction with the results suggested by
theory.
    A simple consideration shows that the action of diatomic bro
mides upon bases must give rise to the formation of several classes
of compounds. Let us examine by way of illustration the products
which may be expected to be formed in the reaction between am
monia and dibromide of ethylene.
   'The diatomic bromide being capable of <U+FB01>xing two molecules of
ammonia, we have in the <U+FB01>rst place four diatomic bromides of the
formula:
                         teams-its  2       2    r2

                         [(0. 11.)."      N.1"Br.
    These are, however, by no means the only salts which, in accord
ance with our present conception of diatomic compounds, may be
formed in this reaction.         Taking into consideration the general
deportment     of dibromide   of  ethylene, there could be no doubt that,
under certain conditions, this body would act with ammonia as a
monoatomic compound, giving rise to another series of bodies, in
which the hydrogen would be more or less replaced by the mono
atomic molecule C, H, Br, viz.
                         [(C2H413r       HaN] Br
                         [(02   H, Br  2 H2 N] Br

                         [(C, H‘ Br),       N] Br.
    Further, if the reaction took place in the presence of water, it was
to be expected that the latent bromine of these salts, wholly or par
tially eliminated in the form of hydrobromic acid, would be replaced
by the molecular residue of water, and thus, independently of any
mixed compounds containing simultaneously bromine and oxygen, a
series of salts might be looked for, in which a molecule C2 H, (HO)=
C2 H5 0 would enter monoatomically.

products, it appeared not improbable that a fourth series of bodies
would likewise be formed,

    I have not, indeed, met with the whole of these compounds; but in
   the place of the de<U+FB01>cient members of the groups new products have
   made their appearance, whose formation in the present state of our

    of disentangling the dif<U+FB01>culties of this reaction becomes a task of
   very considerable dif<U+FB01>culty.           Nor did the action of dibromide of

   hydrogen—whereby the formation of a large number of compounds
   of subordinate theoretical interest was excluded—the general cha
  'racter of the reaction, the recognition of which was the object of
   the inquiry, became at once perceptible.
       I  have shown that the action of dibromide of ethylene upon
   triethylphosphine gives rise to the formation of four different com
   pounds, viz.

   each of which represents           one of the four groups of compounds,
   which under favourable circumstances may arise from the mutual
   reaction between ammonia and dibromide of ethylene, the produc
  tion of' a greater number of terms being impossible on account of
   the ternary substitution of triethylphosphine.
      Whilst going on with the            researches on the phosphorus~bases
   which    I  have  taken  the   liberty of submitting to the Royal Society,
   in notes sketched     as   I advanced,    I have not altogether lost sight of
   the experiments in the nitrogen-series, which had originally sug
  gested     these inquiries.      Numerous nitrogenated bases, both mono—
   atomic and      diatomic,   with  which   I  have become acquainted during
   this investigation, must       be reserved   for a future communication.     I
  may here only       remark,   that   these  substances,  although differing in
,  several points, nevertheless       imitate in their general department so
   closely   the  corresponding terms of the phosphorus-series, that the
  picture which I have endeavoured to delineate of the phosphorus
  compounds, illustrates in a great measure the history of the nitrogen
  bodies.
      In conclusion, a few words about the further development of
                                                                                  ‘
  which the experiments on the polyatomic bases appear to be capable,
  and about the direction in which I propose to pursue the track which
  they have opened.
      Conceived in its simplest form, the transition from the series of

Relations      between the   Monoatomic and   the   Polyatomic Bases. 395
 monoatomic to that of diatomic bases, may be referred to the intro
 duction of a monoehlorinated or a monobrominated alcohol-radical
 into the type ammonia, the chlorine and bromine thus inserted
 furnishing the point of attack for a second molecule of ammonia.
   If   in bromide of ethylammonium—to pass from the phosphorus
 series to the more generally interesting nitrogen-series—we replace
__1. equiv.
            of the hydrogen in ethyle by bromine, we arrive at _bro_
 mide of bromethylammonium, which <U+FB01>xing a second equivalent of
 ammonia, is converted into the dibromide of ethylene-diammonium,
 the latent bromine becoming accessible to silver-salts.        ~

   The further elaboration of this reaction indicates two different
methods for the construction of the pol atomic bases of a higher
order. In the <U+FB01>rst place, the number olyammonia-molecules, to be
incorporated in the new system, ma be increased by the gradually
advancing bromination of the radica . By the further bromination
of ethyle in bromide of bromethylammonium and the action of
           on the bodies thus produced, the following salts may be

    Again, the <U+FB01>xation of the ammonia-molecules may be attempted,
not   by the progressive bromination of the ethyle, but        by

pendicular    to  the  axis.   The   theorems    which    the  author    establishes
are the following :—
   THEOREM I.-—The curves described by the extremity of the axis
of the gyroscope are system of spherical cycloids generated by the
                              a
motion of        point on the spherical radius of
                    a                                          circle, which, con
                                                                  a
stantly remaining       on  the  same   sphere, rolls    without    sliding on the
circumference of another <U+FB01>xed circle situated on the same sphere.
These cycloids may be either ordinary, curtate, or prolate—including
the case when the system degenerates into               circle, in which case the
                                                        a
generating point       becomes    the  centre    of  the   rolling circle. Their
species depends      on  the  direction  of  the  initial velocity communicated
to the axis, the direction in which the instrument                set rotating, and
                                                                      is

motion of the axis to become for          a time sensibly one of uniform pro
gression   ;     then becomes oscillatory again, the amplitudes of the
                it

that of    a circular pendulum, which does not involve the angular
velocity  of rotation impressed on the gyroscope.

  '
     THEOREM llI.-—-lf the gyroscope be set rotating rapidly, and its
  axis of <U+FB01>gure be constrained, as in Theorem 11., to move very freely
  in a plane <U+FB01>xed with regard to the horizon, the axis will tend to take
  the position of the projection on the given plane of the line drawn
 through the centre of gravity of the gyroscope, parallel to the axis
  of the earth, in such a way that the earth and the gyroscope may
  turn in the same direction ; while, if the axis be perfectly free, it will
  move exactly in the same way as the axis of a telescope directed con
 stantly towards the same <U+FB01>xed star, their initial positions being sup
 posed parallel, as established experimentally by M. Léon Foucault
 (Comptes Rendus, September, 1852).
    To prove this theorem, the angular velocity of the earth round its
 axis is resolved into an equal and codirectional motion of rotation
 round the line through the centre of gravity of the gyroscope parallel
 to the earth’s axis, and a motion of translation, the direction of which
 is constantly changing, common to all parts of the earth. Of these
 motions the latter is communicated to the gyroscope by the friction
 of its base, and does not modify its position with regard to the
 horizon. The <U+FB01>rst alone requires to be considered. In order to
 estimate its effect, a rotation equal to it and round the same axis, but
 in an opposite direction, must be supposed to be communicated both
to the earth and the gyroscope. This does not affect their relative
motion, and simpli<U+FB01>es the problem, as it enables us to consider the
earth at rest. The relative motion of the gyroscope may therefore
be found by adding to the three components, round its principal
axis, of its instantaneous angular velocity of rotation, as found from
its e uations of absolute motion, the components of this introduced
velocity of rotation, the moment of resistance of the given plane
being taken into account in forming the equations of motion, and its
intensity supposed such as to counteract that part of the total angular
velocity of the axis which is perpendicular to the given plane. The
equation which determines the motion of the axis is shown to be
identical with that of a circular pendulum, and the motion con
sequently one of oscillation, the mean position of the axis being that
in which it approaches, as close as the conditions of the question
permit, to the line drawn through its centre of gravity arallel to
the earth’s axis, and in which it rotates in a direction simi at to that
of the earth’s rotation. Similar reasoning establishes the 'second
part of the theorem, which is theoretically true whether the gyro
scope be set rotating or not. This result            is,
                                                      however, in practice
modi<U+FB01>ed     by the e<U+FB01>‘ects of friction; but when    rapid rotatory motion
                                                     a
has been impressed on the gyroscope,           it
                                               acquires    astability which
enables   itto overcome to      great extent these effects.

the  concentric space between the steam-tube and a wider tube in
which the steam-tube was placed. The steam-tube was connected
at its lower end with a receiver to hold the condensed water.     A
mercury gauge indicated the pressure within the apparatus.      The
principal object of the author was to ascertain the conductivity of
the tube under varied circumstances, by applying the formula sug

water in pounds transmitted per hour, V and v the differences of
temperature between the inside of the steam-tube, and the refrige
rating water at its entrance and at its exit. The following are some
of the author's most important conclusions.
     1. The pressure in the vacuous space is sensibly the same in all
           '
p artst
    2. It is amatter of indifference in which direction the refrigeratin
water <U+FB02>ows in reference to the direction of the steam and condensed
water.
     3. The temperature of the vacuous space is sensibly equal in all its
P 'arts.
    It. The resistance to conductivity must be attributed almost entirely
 to the <U+FB01>lm of water in immediate contact with the inside and outside
 surfaces of the tube, and is little in<U+FB02>uenced by the kind of metal of
 which the tube is composed, or by its thickness up to the limits of
 that of ordina     tubes.
     5. The con uctivity increases up to a limit as the rapidity of the
 stream of water is augmented.
     6. By the use of a spiral of wire to give a rotary motion of the
 water in the concentric space, the conductivity is increased for the
 same head of water.
     The author, in conclusion, gives an account of experiments with
  atmospheric air as the refrigerating agent; the conductivity is very
  small in this case, and will probably prevent air being employed for
  the condensation of steam except in very peculiar circumstances.

   We may here remark that the recorded analyses of narcotine and
its salts, with the exception of one by Dr. Hofmann, published by
Blyth, agree at least as well with the former as with the latter for
mula ; moreover, during the course of experiments made with several
  ounds of narcotine, we have observed nothing, either in the be—
haviour of this base itself, or in the nature or preportions of its pro
ducts of decomposition, to indicate that it was variable in composition.
Further data are, however, needed for the <U+FB01>nal decision of this
question, and we shall accordingly feel very much indebted to any
chemist who has a specimen of narcotine of well-ascertained origin,
or which he believes to have a different composition from that given
above, if he will kindly spare us a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity for analysis.
                            II. Composition ofColarnine.
   The combustion of cotarnine with oxide of copper and oxygen, as
well as the determination of the proportion of platinum in its chloro~
platinate, leads us to adopt the formula C'ZH‘SNO“ for this base.
The formula usually adopted contains one more atom of carbon; but,
independently of our analytical results, the supposition that cotarnine
contains onl twelve atoms of carbon is supported by the simple
manner in w ich the action of oxidizing substances on narcotine can
then be expressed, namely, by the equation
                  CI? H23                 = Clo HID 05 +Cl2           H13  NOl,

decomposed by dilute nitric acid.
                  III.  Decomposition;    of Opianic Acid.
    Opianic acid is readily decomposed when heated with strong
hydriodic acid ; no iodine is set free, but iodide of methyle is formed
in considerable quantity at the same time as a non-volatile substance,
ve     easil altered by heat and exposure to air, especially if in contact
wit alkaii, the precise nature of which we have not yet been able to
 ascertain.
     When opianic acid is heated with an excess of a very strong solu
 tion of potash, it splits up into meconine and hemipinic acid. These
substances were found by experiment to be formed in proportions
 corresponding to the equation
                2Cm H1 ‘0’     = C‘” H‘°O‘      +    C” HMO“.
                Opianic acid.      M econine.      llemipinic acid.
     The meconine thus produced has all the characters which have been
 ascribed by previousobservers to meconine obtained by other processes;
 its identity was further established by analysis, and by the preparation
 of chloro- and nitro-meeonine, the former of which was analysed.
 The hemipinic acid was also found to be identical with that obtained
   irectly from narcotine: the acid and its silver-salt were analysed.
     Having thus found a method by which meconine and hemipinic
 acid can be produced with certainty and in large uantities, we intend
 to make an extended investigation of them and 0 opianic acid, in the
 hope of discovering the nature of the relationship of these three bodies
 to each other and to narcotine. The principal results which we have
  hitherto obtained in this direction are as follows.
     Action of Hydriodic Acid on Meconine.—Mcconine is decomposed
  by hydriodic acid like opianic acid, giving iodide of methyle and an
  easily alterable substance, the nature of which has not been deter
  mined.
     Action of Hydriodic Acid on Hemipinic Acid.—Hemipinic acid,
  heated with concentrated hydriodic acid to within a few degrees of the
  boiling-point of the latter substance, is decomposed into iodide of
  meth le, carbonic acid, and an acid of the formula C7 H6 0‘.         It was
  foun by direct experiment that two atoms of iodide of methyle are
  formed from each atom of hemipinic acid, so that the following
  equation probably represents the reaction :—
               C‘° II"  O“+2Hl= 2CHa I+ (102+ C7 H“ O'
              Hemipinic acid.                           New acid.
     The   new acid is moderately soluble in cold water, and very soluble
  in boiling water, alcohol, and ether; its solution has a strongly acid
  reaction with test-paper. It separates from hot water in small needle
  shaped crystals containing 1480         er cent. water of crystallization,
  which they lose at 100° (the formu a C7 H8 O‘ + 15H2 0 corresponds
  to 14'92 per cent. water) ; at a higher temperature the acid melts
  and sublimes without apparent alteration.
     Dried at 100°, it gave the following results on analysis       :—

                                        are the same as those of the
methyl-narcotine and methyl-cotarnine of Hinterberger and Wer
theim.   The ground upon which Wertheim admitted the existence of
ethyl- and                   was the formation of volatile bases con
              'N and C’H“N by the distillation of narcotine with
taining C’ plropyl-narcotine
potash.   An experiment which we have made goes some way
towards explaining the formation of these bases without assuming the
existence of more than one variety of narcotine. Having so frequently
observed the formation of methyle-compounds from the derivatives

                                  Geological Society.                             403
of narcotine,        we tried the direct action of hydriodic acid on this
base, expecting to obtain iodide of methyle.                By distilling 20 grms.
of narcotine with           concentrated hydriodic acid, 19 grms. of pure
iodide of methylc          were   obtained, a quantity which corresponds, as
nearly as could be expected, with three atoms of iodide of methyle
for one atom of narcotine",
              (Cz’HzaNO’        : SCH’I     : : 413  : 436 or  20: 21'1).
     Narcotine therefore contains three atoms of mether so combined as
to be easily separable T; and it is very probable that when it is di
stilled with potash, according to the conditions of the experiment,
sometimes nearly pure ammonia is evolved, while, at other times,
methylamine, CH” N, dimethylamine, C“ H7 N, or trimethylamine,
C’ H” N, predominates.

     l. ” On the Lines of Deepest Water around the British Isles."
 By the Rev. R. Everest, F.G.S.
     By drawing on a chart a line traversing the deepest soundings
 along the English Channel and the Eastern Coast of England and
 Scotland, continuing it along the IOU-fathom-line on the Atlantic
 side of Scotland and Ireland, and connecting with it the line of
 deepest soundings along St. George's Channel, an unequal-sided
 hexagonal <U+FB01>gure is described around the British Isles, and a pen
 tagonal <U+FB01>gure around Ireland. A hexagonal polygon may be similarly
 de<U+FB01>ned around the Isle of Arran.                 These lines were described in
 detail by the       author,  who pointed out that they limited areas similar
 to the polygonal form that stony or earthy bodies take in shrinking,
 either in the process of cooling or in drying.               The relations of the
  100-fathom-line to the promontories, the inlets, and general contour

 drawn across the British Isles from the projecting angles of the
 polygon appear to have on the strike and other conditions of the
 strata were described. After some remarks on the probable e<U+FB01>’ect
 that shrinkage of the earth's crust must have on the ejection of
 molten rock, the author observed that. in his opinion, the action of
  shrinking is the only one we know of that will afford any solution
 of the phenomena treated of in this paper, namely, long lines of
  depression accompanied by long lines of elevation, often, as in the
  case. of the British Isles, Spain and Portugal, and elsewhere, belong

     2. “ On the Ludlow Bone-bed and its Crustacean Remains."                        By
 J.  Harley,M.B.
     Of the two bone-beds occurring near Ludlow,                the lower one (seen
 in  Ludford   Lane    and    on  the   north-east    slopes   of  Whitcli<U+FB01>) is that
 which     has  supplied    the   author    with  the    materials    for this paper.
 Besides spines,     teeth,   and  shagreen-like     remains     of <U+FB01>sh,   the author
 <U+FB01>nds    in  the  Ludlow      Bone-bed     three   kinds    of  minute    organisms     :
 1st, conical bodies, the same as the
                                               " Conodonts ” of Pander; 2ndly,
 bodies somewhat like the crown of a molar tooth; 3rdly, oblong
 plates. All these bodies possess the same chemical composition and
 microscopical structure— which is decidedly Crustacean.                          With
 Pterygotus     they  do  not   appear   to  have  any   relationship,   unless   some
 are  the  stomach-teeth    :  nor do  they   show  any   alliance  with   Trilobites   ;
 but   with   Ceratiocaris    they  have   a great  resemblance      as to   structural
 characters, and some of them were probably the minute secondary
 spines of the tail of that Phyllopod. The plate'like forms might have
belonged to Squilloid or Limuloid Crustaceans.                     To facilitate the
recognition     of  these  bodies,    Mr.   Harley   places    them   all in one pro~
visional genus      with   the   name     of Aslacoderma.         A  letter   from Dr.
 V olborth to the author was also read in con<U+FB01>rmation of Mr. Harley's
 opinion that these bodies are identical with Dr. Pander's "Cono

    The author described the series of strati<U+FB01>ed rocks belonging to
the Old Red Sandstone, upwards of 3000 feet in thickness, stretching
southward from the Grampians to the coast of Fifeshire.                     lat. Dark
red grits (with cornstones and <U+FB01>agstones) equivalent to the English

Diplacanlhus gracilis. and other fossils belong to this part of the
series.    3rdly. Thick-bedded red sandstone (with cornstone) : Cepha
luspis and Pleraspis.            4thly. Soft deep-red sandstones.                5thly.
Spotted marls and shades : these are the uppermost, and may be the
equivalent of the Holoptychian beds of Clashbiuuie.                      The author
showed that between the Grampians and the trappean hills of Bun
nichen and Bunbarrow the series forms a great syncline; and be
tween these hills and the sea the older beds are twice again brought
to the surface; and he believes that the marls and sandstones at
Whiteness are not unconformable, as Sir C. Lyell has represented
them in his published section.

   At Edd, lat. 13° 57' N., long. 41° 4’ E., about half-way between
Massouah and the Straits of Bab-el-Mandel,              earthquake-shocks
occurred on the night of the 7th of May or the morning of the 8th,
during about an hour.            At sunrise <U+FB01>ne dust fell, at <U+FB01>rst white,
afterwards red; the day was pitch-dark; and the dust was nearly knee
deep. On the 9th the fall of dust abated; and at night <U+FB01>re and
smoke were seen issuing from Jebel Dubheh, a mountain about a
day’s journey inland ; and sounds like the <U+FB01>ring of cannon were heard.
At Perim these sounds were heard at about 2 am. on the 8th, and at
long intervals up to the 10th or 11th. The dust was also met with
at sea; and along the entire coast of Yemen the dust fell for several
days.    Several shocks were felt on the 8th at Mokha and Hodaida.

its 16,000 inhabitants.        Altogether there were eighty-<U+FB01>ve shocks in
ten days. The land-wave appears to have come from the south-east.
Several towns S.E. of Buenos Ayres felt slight shocks.           N0 earth
quake took place in Chile; but travellers crossing the Upsallata
Pass of the Cordilleras met with a shower of ashes; the pass was
obstructed by broken rocks; and chusms opened on all sides.             At
Buenos Ayres, 323 leagues from Mendoza, and elsewhere, it was ob
served in watch-makers’ shops that the pendulums moving N. and
S. were accelerated; those moving E. and W. were not affected.

J. W. Dykes,      Esq. In a Letter to Sir C. Lyell, F.G.S.
   In  the districts    of the Kistna and Godavery, the land presents a
parallel  series  of ridges and hollows near the coast, not in relation to
the rivers but to the coast-line.        These may have been formed by
sedimentary     deposits    similar to what  are now taking place on the
Coromandel coast.          By the strong currents alternately running N.
and 3., according to the monsoons, lines of sediment parallel with
the coast are formed; and by the occasional interference of winds
and tides dams are thrown across the hollows, and the latter soon
become <U+FB01>lled up. These parallel bands of coast-land become, in
time, upheaved, and more or less affected by atmospheric agencies.

             ON A NEIVLY       DISCOVERED ACTION OF LIGHT.
                        BY M. NIIEPCE DE ST. VICTOR.
       HEN the freshly broken part of an opake porcelain plate was
         exposed to a strong sun for two or three hours, and then placed
 on choride of silver paper, after twenty-four hours’ contact the silver

   406             .Inlelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.
   was found to be reduced in the part corresponding to that which had
   been exposed to light, but there was no reduction in that part which
   had been preserved from light.       Certain <U+FB01>ne specimens of porcelain
   acquire this activity more easily.
      A steel plate polished at one part, and roughened at another by
   the action of aquafortis, and well cleaned by alcohol, was exposed to
   the sun for two or three hours under the following conditions—half
   the polished and unpolished plate under an opake screen, and the
   other half under a white glass. The plate was then covered by a paper
   prepared with ulbuminized chloride of silver.         After twenty-four
   hours’ contact, an impressionwas formed on the unpolished part which
   had been exposed to the light, but none on the polished part, nor on
   the unpolished part under the screen.         A roughened glass plate
   carefully cleaned gave similar results.
      These experiments show that it is not necessary for the reduction
   of silver salts that there be a chemical action, as when a metallic
   salt is insulated with an organic matter. M. Arnaudon has repeated
   some of these experiments with different gases, and has obtained the
   same results as with air.
      I may here recall a previous observation, that the insolated earth
   exhibits traces of this action to a depth of a metre, the thickness
   varying, of course, with the nature of the soil and the degree of in
   solation.    The following experiment supports this view :—-In a tin
   tube lined with pasteboard impregnated with tartaric acid, and in
'
   solated so as strongly to reduce silver salts, I placed in the middle of
   the tube, but not in contact, a small bladder containing a weak so
   lution of starch ; after forty-eight hours this starch feebly reduced
   Barreswil's liquor, while other starch placed in the. same conditions,
   excepting the insolation, produced no effect on the liquor.
      The following experiments were made with a view of trying
   whether light could magnetize a steel bar, as has frequently been
   stated.    Avoiding all sources of error, a knitting-needle suspended
   by a hair was entirely unattracted by another needle insulated for a.
   very long time in a beam of light concentrated by a strong lens,
  'whether the light was white or had traversed a violet glass.
      I then enclosed a needle in a paper impregnated with nitrate of
   uranium, or tartaric acid, and insolated; I also suspended a needle
   horizontally in tubes containing insolated pasteboard ; and the results
   \vere always negative, as also was the case with experiments made
   with very feebly magnetized needles in the hope of demagnetizing
   them.
      In conclusion, this persistent activity imparted by light to porous
   bodies cannot be the same as ph0sphorescence ; for, from Becquerel's
   experiments, it would not continue so long: it is probable that, as
   Foucault believes, it is a radiation invisible to our eyes, and which
   does not traverse glass.—Comptes Rendus, July 1, 1861.
             ON  TERRESTRIAL‘REFRACTION.          BY M. BABINET.
       A ray of light which      traverses the layers of the atmosphere
   horizontally,  is de<U+FB02>ected from its rectilinear path towards the earth.

                   Intelligence             and Miscellaneous       Articles.                     407
by    a quantity which, in themean, is a <U+FB01>fteenth of the terrestrial
are  extending from the point where the ray enters to the point at
which it arrives. Thus for a horizontal path of 1852 metres, which
is equal to a minute of an are on the terrestrial globe, the de<U+FB02>ection
or refraction of the ray would be 11K of a minute, or 4".
   There are three things to be considered in this question ;—
   1. The trajectory of the ray is a circle.
   2. There is a constant ratio n between the quantity by which the
ray is in<U+FB02>ected, and the terrestrial are comprised between the point
of entrance of the ray taken to be horizontal, and its point of
arrival.   Then let s be the angle at the earth's centre comprised
between these two points, and r the refraction, we have
              r
                    "

Here  R is the mean radius of the earth; B is its atmospheric pres
sure reduced to zero; a is the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion         of the
air for 1° C; d is the density of mercury as compared with air taken
at zero; and (what is new and important) M is the height in metres
corresponding to a diminution of one degree on the Centigrade scale.

 Several remarkable conclusions may be deduced from this, relating to
 the physical constitution of the atmosphere.
    3. If the ray does not travel horizontally, but is inclined to the hori

There Would         be no refraction,               and the ray would travel in               a   right

the number M exerts on the stability of the atmosphere; but the
formula which gives the value of a shows that in the vicinity of the
soil the temperature decreases far more rapidly than ae'rostatic ascents
would seem to indicate.
    In a second note. M. Babinet gives a complete development of the
above formula; and in a third note he gives a complete formula for
refraction.
    He supposed the heights 5 taken above the horizon of the observer,
and not from a point of the surface corresponding to tilt. Taking,
as is necessary, the height It of a point of the trajectory of the ray
on the vertical passing by this point, it follows that for horizontal
refraction the atmospheric path is very limited, and that therefore
the expression for refraction could never be a formula which becomes
 in<U+FB01>nite'for :=90°. Supposing always a decrease of 1° C. for M
metres, the complete differential formula is

published     anew determination of the maximum density of sea
water.    Like Kopp and other physicists, who have made this deter
mination for pure water, he measured the volume at ditferent tempe

LIII.   Explanation of a Projection by Balance of Errors for
   llfaps applying to a very large extent of the Earth’s Surface ,
   and Comparison of this projection with other projections.        By
    G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal*.
    1.       the projection for maps, whose principles      I am about
       IN to explain,   any  point  of the earth’s  surface  (as Green
wich, Paris, 8m.) may be adopted as the Centre of Reference, to
be represented by the Central Point of the Map.           But the pro
jection which    I propose, and those with which       I shall compare
it, are all subjected to the following conditions: that the azimuth
of any other point on the earth, as viewed from the Centre of
Reference, shall be the some as the azimuth of the corresponding
point of the map as viewed from the central point of the map;
and that equal great-circle distances of other points on the earth
from the Centre of Reference, in all directions, shall be represented
by equal radial distances from the central point of the map.
These conditions include the Stereographic Projection, Sir H.
James’s Projection, and others; but they exclude Mercator’s
Projection, and the projections proposed by Sir John Herschel.
    2. In projections like these, in which the relation of the sur
face represented to the surface representing it is the same in all
directions from the central point, it is unnecessary for us to em
barrass ourselves with considerations of the place of the pole and
the forms of the curves representing arcs of meridian and paral
lels. It will be suf<U+FB01>cient to consider what will be the radii of
circles on the map which shall represent circles on the earth, of
different radii (as measured by arcs of great circle), but having
the centre of reference as their common centre ; and when values
are found for the radii of these circles on the map, means will

  410      The Astronomer Royal       on a   Projection   for Maps
  easily be found for exhibiting, with their assistance, the points
  of intersection of meridians and parallels which are referred to
  the pole of the earth.
     3. The tap eners, to one‘or‘both of which all projections are
  liable, are, Change of Area, and Distortion, as applying to small
  portions of the earth’s surface. “On the one hand, a projection
  may be invented (to which    Ishall give the name of “ Projection
  with Unchanged Areas ”) in which there is no Change of Area,
  but excessive Distortion, for parts far from the centre; on the
  other hand, the Stereographie Projection has no Distortion, but
  has great Change of Area for distant parts.     Between these lie
  the projections which have usually been adopted by geographers,
  with the tacit purpose of greatly reducing the error of one kind
  by the admission of’a small error of the other kind, but without
  any distinctly-expressed     principle (so far as   I
                                                      know) for their
  guidance in the details of the projection.        I    _      w
     4. My object in this paper is to exhibit a distinct mathema
  tical process for determining the magnitudes of these errors, so
  that the result of their combination shall be most advantageous.
  This principle   I  call ‘5 The Balance of Errors.” It is founded
  upon   the following assumptions and inferences :—
 _   First. The Change of Area being represented by
                           projected area    _—
                                                  ,
                           original   area
  and the Distortion being represented by
ratio of projected sides
                            ___ projected length x original breadth   _—
 ratioeforiginal sides         pi'ojected breadth x origih<U+FB01> length
  (where the length of the rectangle is in the direction of the
 great circle connecting the reetangle’s centre with the Centre of
  Reference, and the breadth is transverse to that great circle),
 these two errors, when of equal magnitude, may be considered
  as equal evils.
     Second. As the annoyance produced by a negative value of
  either of these formulae is as great as that produced by a positive
  value, we must use some even power of the formulae to represent
  the real amount of the evil of each.       Ishall take the squares.
     Third. The total evil in the projection of any small part may
  properly be represented b the sum of these squares.
     Fourth. The total evil, on the entire Map ma therefore be
  properly represented by the summation through             tlie
                                                            whole Map
  (respect being  bad  to the magnitude    of  every small area) of the
  sum of these squares for every small area.                          .
     Fifth. The process for determining the most advantageous
  projection will therefore consist in determining the laws ex;

“ great-circle radii on the earth,” which will make the total

represented as has   just been stated, the smallest possible.
   5. Now let I and b be tho'length and breadth of a small rect
angle on the earth’s surface, and suppose- that the11ength and
breadth of the corresponding rectangle on the map are 1+ 51 and
b + 8b, and neglect powers of 81 and 5b above the <U+FB01>rst. (Although
this does not appl with algebraic correctness to very great
change of area and distortion, yet it will be found by the result
that the theoretical failure introduces no practical inconve
vience.)   Then the Change of Area

Thus,  if we possess a map in which the meridians and parallels
are drawn through the circles and radial lines on one projection,
then for any other projection we have merely to draw radial lines,
and to describe circles with the radii given by the Table of
article 12, by the formulas of article 20, or by equivalent state
ments, for that other projection ; and we can at once lay down
among the radii and circles of the second projection the inter
sections corresponding to those of the <U+FB01>rst projection as seen
among its radii and circles.
 - 22. There is one projection in which the Meridians and Paral
lels are described with comparative facility, because all are accu
rately circular arcs, namely the Stereographic.     This projection,
therefore, will be most proper for use as the standard projection,
by means of which any others may be drawn.         As a termination
to this paper,     I
                  will here place the formulae required for drawing
a Stereographic Map with any Centre of Reference.
    Let a be the linear radius of the circle which would include a.
hemisphere of the earth, ,8 the radius of the proposed map, in

in south latitude, it will only be necessary to invert the map.)

   (2) Through the centre of the map a line must be drawn as
polar axis. On this line will lie the centres of all the circles
representing  parallels of latitude.

representing   this parallel, with  the polar axis, will be north of

          FROM
             settled opinion that the larger part of the rain which
    falls upon the surface of the earth does not proceed from the
    clouds, as we should naturally suppose, but    derived from the             is
    lower strata of the atmosphere, within 200 or 300 feet of the

422        Mr. W. S. vaous      on the De<U+FB01>ciency    of Rain in an
surface.   This paradox has been founded upon the fact that a
rain-gauge, when placed at a moderate elevation in the atmo
sphere, is found to collect much less rain than if placed upon
the ground.      As the sudden increase of rain while it falls
throuch the intervening air cannot be explained in accordance
with the known laws of nature, many writers have spoken doubt
fully of this subject, but have brought forward only scanty or
'palpably erroneous arguments to account for the experimental
results.
'
   2.  I now hope to show that the observed differences of rain
fall must be attributed to the in<U+FB02>uence of the wind upon our
mode of experiment.
   3. 'In observations with rain-gauges at different elevations,
the higher gauges have been placed upon the roofs of houses,
the summits of church-towers, or other erections which act as
obstacles to the wind.   It is obvious, too, that the rain-gauge
is itself an obstacle, causing the wind to swerve aside, and to
change the direction in which the rain-drops fall.
   4. In order to determine the curves which the wind describes
'in meeting such obstacles,          I
                                    have performed some small expe
riments.     A vessel is formed of two oblong plates of glass,
enclosing a layer of air about a quarter of an inch thick.       One
end of the vessel communicates through a pipe with a chimney
or an aspirator, so that a regulated current of air may be drawn
through     it,
              to represent on       small scale
                                    a             section of the wind
                                                    a
moving over     the  surface of the earth.   The curves described by
the currents ol air are shown very distinctly and beautifully by
simply holding        piece of smoking brown paper in the draught
                        a
of air which about to enter the glass vessel. We may now
                   is
place in the lower part of the current any small obstacle to
represent   a house or rain-gauge placed in wind, and the curves
                            a
 described    by the air will be depicted     the streams of smoke.
                                               by
    In trying such experiments,          it soon perceived that the
                                              is
 curves are similar so long as the velocity of the current changes
 proportionally to the magnitude of the obstacle; and        I am led
to believe that the miniature experiment will indicate the course
pursued     bythe actual wind meeting an obstacle, provided that
the velocity of the wind and the magnitude of the obstacle bear
 somewhat the same proportion to each other as in the experiment.
From such observations          have drawn the dotted lines in <U+FB01>gs.
                                I                                   2

 by  horizontal strata of air meeting an obstacle, such as      house

 (<U+FB01>g. 2), or  a rain-gauge (<U+FB01>g. 3).     Whatever may be the value of
the experimental method,        itcannot be denied that the air must
move    somewhat    as  shown  in these <U+FB01>gures.

                    diminish the quantity of rain falling in the intermediate space.

424!         Mr. W. S. Jevous on       the De<U+FB01>ciency        of Rain in an
supposed <U+FB01>xed in mid-air.                               I
                                It is here, venture to hope, ren
dered quite plain that less rain will fall upon the summit of the
obstacle than elsewhere, the surplus being carried forward to the
lee side of the obstacle.          I
                             entertain no doubt that we have in
this process a suf<U+FB01>cient explanation of the observed de<U+FB01>ciency of
rain in elevated places.
   8. It is an evident corollary of this explanation, that no de<U+FB01>
ciency of rain would be observed did the measuring instrument
cause no disturbance in the wind.      But only a gauge of which
the mouth is level with the ground ful<U+FB01>ls this condition.      Pro
bably, indeed, the church-tower or house upon which a gauge is
usually elevated occasions the chief part of the de<U+FB01>ciency. Hence
a gauge suspended in mid-air would collect more rain than if it
were placed on a house.      Yet a rain-gauge is itself an obstacle
of some importance, and will cause a part of the rain to pass on
unmeasured, as          I
                     have attempted to represent in <U+FB01>g. 3.      The
hollow of the funnel in this <U+FB01>gure, it will be observed, is <U+FB01>lled
up with an eddy of wind.
   9. In these drawings,           I
                              should observe, some little exaggera~
tion must be excused: no notice, too, is taken of the motion of
the wind in the third dimension of space, that           round the is,
obstacle instead of over it.
   10. Thus having reason to suppose that the de<U+FB01>ciency of rain
at elevated points was due to the disturbance of the wind, have             I
examined all the observations and statements       could meet with
                                                             I
bearing on the subject, and <U+FB01>nd my opinion, on the whole,
strongly con<U+FB01>rmed.
   An intelligent observer, Mr. H. Boase of Penzance, after
four months’ experiment, remarks*, “ Having observed that
the difference between the <U+FB01>rst and the other gauges varied with
more or less wind, its velocity has been registered from observa
tion; but not having an accurate anemometer, we cannot yet
offer any certain conclusion further than this, that the difference
of the quantity of rain received in gauge placed on the top of
                                             a
a building, and one at level with the surface of the ground, is,
                               a
for some reason or other, proportional to the velocity           the         of
wind.”
   11. Again, taking the measurements of rain-1' made     Luke              by
Howard, and arranging them in the order of the ratio of the
quantities in the lower and higher gauges, we <U+FB01>nd that we have
also arranged them almost exactly in the order of the amount
of accompanying wind, as indicated               by
                                       the notes annexed.  The

from three gauges placed at different heights have been daily
recorded for about twenty years past. Examining the individual
results,  I  was surprised to <U+FB01>nd great irregularity and want of
accordance.        Thus several hundredths of an inch of rain are often
registered in the lowest gauge and none in the highest.                           Occa
sionally  the  middle         gauge     alone    has  caught any      rain  l  .he   fol

   These observations having been made by gentlemen of high
ability and well-known scienti<U+FB01>c zeal, the discordances can only
be attributed to the erroneous nature of the rain-gauge, and to
the very unsuitable position and form of the Greenwich Observa
tory for rain observations: of course it is useless to look for any
uniform law or ratio where such discrepancies may occur.                             The
discordances, too, have no obvious relation with the force of the
   Phil. blag. S. 4. Vol. 22. No. 149. Dec. 1861.                              2 F

1426            Mr. W. S. Jevons           on the De<U+FB01>ciency   of Rain in an
wind, but might perhaps be explained by comparison with the
direction and force of the wind combined.               They serve me
here amply to establish the unsatisfactory nature of the best
rain measurements.
    13. It is in this subject quite fallacious to appeal to average
results; for an appearance of uniformity and law will arise in the
long run, according to the doctrine of probabilities, however
irregular and various the causes which produce the difference.
A law of nature must appear in every case in which it acts alone,
reasonable error of observation being allowed for; but the dis
crepancies of individual rain observations at different altitudes
are such as can come under no law.             Even average or total
quantities    for  short  periods   are  extremely   discordant.    Prof.
Phillips’s  observations   are stated  in weekly   totals* ; but  in  the
week February 19 to 26, 1832, we <U+FB01>nd that the lowest gauge
 received nearly six times as much rain as the upper one upon
 the York Minster, while in the next succeeding week but one
 the lower gauge contained only 1'22 times (or 1}) as much
 as the other.     The circumstances fully explain this difference,
 " violent gales” having occurred in the former week and “per
 pendicular rain, without a trace of wind, in large drops
                                                                 ” in the
 latter.   This last statement will again be referred to (see par. 27).
     14. Arago’s results at the Paris Observatory, although pretty
 uniform when stated in yearly averages, exhibit similar dis
 cordanccs in the separate months.         From a Table in the Ency

in discussing his observations*, adds the signi<U+FB01>cant remark,
“ March very anomalous.” Now March is in Europe the month
in which strong, dry, north-east winds and equinoetial gales
most occur, the very circumstances under which we should
expect the results to be most erroneous.
    16.   I  may lastly mention the observations of Dr. Buist, who
having made four simultaneous measurements in the Island of
Bombay, to determine the fall of rain at different heights below
200 feet, reported to the British Association, in 1852, that the
results were entirely discordant.       Although all proper precautions
were taken-1', “ no satisfactory conclusion could be drawn, because
the gauges at the several heights below and at 200 feet did not
give uniform results,—sometimes             the most elevated gauges
having the greatest fall of rain, and at other times the lower.
Nor did gauges at similar heights receive the same quantity of
 rain.”
    17. Although the effect of an obstacle upon the wind as
causing a separation or approximation of the rain-drops, and
a de<U+FB01>ciency of rain in an elevated gauge, has now, I believe, for
the <U+FB01>rst time been distinctly brought forward, several writers have
made suggestions          nearly to the same e<U+FB01>ect.        Thus Howard
speaksi      of strong  winds  as robbing  the  higher gauge. Dr. Trail
says§ of Prof. Phillips’s observations,
                                                 “ These differences are
too considerable to be attributed to anything but some imperfec
tion in the instrument when much exposed to gales of wind;
and it probably arises from eddies being formed round the rim
of the funnel, which divert part of the water.”
    Again, H. Meikle writes in the ‘Annals of Philosophyll,’            “I
can hardly pretend to give a complete solution of this well-known
 paradox, but am disposed to think it is in some way owing to the
obstruction which the gauge itself offers to the wind. Perhaps
the winds being made to rush with greater rapidity, and a little
upward in beginning to pass over the mouth of the gauge, pre
vents the rain from falling into that part of it which is next the
wind.”
    This almost coincides with my own explanation; but the
remark is con<U+FB01>ned to the operation of the rain-gauge, which is
usually an inconsiderable obstacle compared with the house or
tower upon which the gauge is placed.

_
    »   Prof. Bache’s “ Note on the E<U+FB01>'ect of De<U+FB02>ected Currents of Air
    on the quantity of Rain collected by a Rain-gauge,” communi
    cated to the British Association in 1838, is to a different effect.
    It proves experimentally the immense differences which may
    occur between gauges placed at the different angles of a building,
    but does not show why a gauge on the top of an obstacle must
    on an average suffer a loss of rain. He found, however, that the
    gauges to the leeward received in general more rain than those
    to the windward, a fact fully in accordance with my theory.
       18. It is hardly necessary to add that my explanation has no
    connexion with that of M. Flaugcrgues*, who in an unfortunate
    moment mistook the sine for the radius of an angle, and argued
    that “less rain will fall into the horizontal opening of the rain
    gauge when the rain is inclined than if it fell vertically, or in
    a direction less inclined.”     As long as the drops fall in parallel
    paths  no such  effect can be  produced; it is the divergence of the
    rain-drops, owing    to  the varying velocity of the wind, which          I
    assert to be the cause of the de<U+FB01>ciency.
       19.       I
              will now approach the subject from an opposite point of
    view, and show      priori that the real increase of rain between the
                          (‘1
    upper  and  lower  gauges     not possible to any appreciable extent,
                                     is
    according to the only physical explanation of the phenomenon
    which has ever been proposed.        This theory was <U+FB01>rst suggested
     by Benjamin Franklin't, who compared       a drop of rain to   bottle
                                                                     a
    of cold water condensing dew upon itself when brought into            a
    warm room.      That rain, even in our hottest days, he adds, comes
    from    very cold region,
             a                     obvious from its falling sometimes in
                                     is
    the form of ice.
       This explanation has been repeated and adopted           by
                                                                almost all
    who have expressed any belief in the phenomenon.           But others
    have shown its utter inadequacy; and the single calculated ex
    ample given       Sir J. Herschel, in his recent excellent ‘Essay
                     by
    on Meteorology I,’ may be adopted in our further discussions.
    “ Admitting,” he says, “a given weight of rain to arrive at 213

    which    itwas formed unaltered, and supposing         itto acquire in

                              Herschel’s suppositions are far too
favourable for the opinion which he opposes.    In the <U+FB01>rst place,
he makes no allowance for the heat derived from the
                                                      gaseous air
in addition to that received from the condensation of vapour.
To estimate the amount of this, we may fairly make the assump
tion that has been found to give very exact results in the theory
of the dry- and wet-bulb hygrometer.    WVe may assume that the
inde<U+FB01>nitely thin <U+FB01>lm of air surrounding the drop of rain always
takes the temperature of the drop, and yields up to it both the
excess of its own sensible heat and the latent heat of the con
densed aqueous vapour (the sensible heat of the aqueous vapour
may be neglected as very minute).   Then according to the for
mula of M. Auguste,—

  say, rather more heat is at <U+FB01>rst received from the cooling of the
  air than from the condensation of vapour. When the drop has
  increased in temperature to 40° F. (t'=4~°'44 C.), the value will
  be '822, or the condensed vapour yields the larger share of heat;
  but even when the drop has the temperature 59°, the value has
  only diminished to '624. Taking an average of these three de
  terminations, we shall <U+FB01>nd that not more than 55 per cent. of
  the heat received by the drop will proceed from condensed
  vapour; consequently we must    '
                                         reduce Sir J. Herschel’s <U+FB01>rst
  estimate almost to its half.
      21. Again, considering that the temperature of the air in
  creases uniformly from the elevation of 12,000 feet, at which
  Sir J. Herschel supposes the drop to be formed, down to its
  temperature at the surface, it is trul extravagant to suppose
  that a rain-drop should fall unaltered through 11,800 or 11,900
  feet and then suddenly assume the full temperature of the air in
  the last 100 or 200 feet.      A small drop falling very slowly will
  take the temperature of the air, or more strictly the temperature
  of evaporation, all the way down, and its degree of coldness on
  reaching the lowest stratum of air will be so slight as to produce
  no appreciable condensation even in perfectly moist air.                On the
  other hand, a large drop falling so rapidly that it has no time to
  receive heat from the air, will indeed remain of a low tempe
  rature, but it will likewise have no time to receive heat from the
  lowest air.    And drops of intermediate size, just in proportion as
  they fall more quickl and receive less heat from the upper strata
  of air, will be less ab e to receive heat from the lowest stratum.
      22. Nor can it be argued that the rain-drop receives heat
  most freely in the lowest stratum of air because it there meets
  most vapour.       For the humidity of the air invariably increases
  from the surface of the earth up to the <U+FB01>rst cloud, as was ob
  served by Mr. Welch in each of his four balloon ascents.                   Even
  under the most rare or impossible hygromctric conditions the
  amount of condensation would be quite inappreciable.                     Under
  any usual or real conditions, it may be most con<U+FB01>dently asserted
  that a falling drop of rain will either increase uniformly through
   out its descent by an extremely minute quantity, or will, as is
   far more likely, evaporate and decrease by a small quantity. Under
   no possible conditions will the increase within the last few hundred
    eet of descent  be more than almost
                                           in<U+FB01>nitesimal.
      23.  It is of course perfectly well known and allowed that the
  temperature of rain is often much lower that that of the air at
  the surface.     I  have myself several times observed remarkably
  cold rain.     S0 M. Boisgiraud* writes to the Paris Academy,

that by experiment he has proved rain to be suf<U+FB01>ciently cold to
produce precipitation even when the air is far from being
saturated.
    In the Greenwich Meteorological Observationsfor 1843        123)              (p.
it    stated that, in occasional observations on the temperature of
     is
the rain, “ It has been always found that when the rain has been
warm with respect to the temperature of the air at the time, no
differences have existed in the quantities of rain collected at the
different heights; but that when the temperature of the air has
been higher than the temperature of the rain,         difference hasa
always existed.”          quite surprising that these writers do not
                            It   is
perceive that their experiments tell directly against their own
conclusions, or at least tell nothing at all to the purpose.                            If   it

to be cold,     simply proves  that  condensation of vapour has not
taken place, otherwise the rain would have been warmed thereby.
If, however, the rain in the higher gauge be found of a low tem
perature,    tells us nothing at all to the purpoae, unless we like
               it
wise prove that the same rain, on reaching the lowest gauge,                                 is
of   amuch higher temperature.      In short, we must have change            a

be added that Arago, in stating it*, argues that the diiliirence of
the rain collected in the two gauges should be greater as the air
is more moist,     consequence which he confesses
                        a                                   not at all  is
conformable to experience.      This remark      strikingly borne out
                                                              is
by  the fact already stated, that the apparent increase of rain
between the higher and lower gauges          usually greatest during
                                                         is
the month of March.       Now this      the month of prevalent dry,
                                                    is
cold, north-east winds and gales, the very circumstances under
which the condensation                theory   is   most utterly inadequate or in
applicable.
   25. A single secondary argument in favour of the supposed
increase of rain-drops remains to be disposed of.     Arago has
remarkedT   that the internal supernumerary fringes of  rainbow              a
are never seen on the lower parts of the bow near the surface of
the earth.   Now the supernumerary bows were explained                                       by
Dr. Young on the theory of interference of undulations; and
their appearance indicates that the drops of rain upon which the
bows appear are of exactly uniform size.      Not observing the

Arago argues that the condition of ef<U+FB01>cacious interference of the
drops must have been destroyed in descending into the lower
                                “ Therefore,” he concludes, “ the drops
part of the atmosphere.
of rain must have much increased in size*.”            Obviously this does
not in the least follow ; for the condition of ef<U+FB01>cacious interference
is uniformity of size? ; and uniform drops, condensing moisture
upon themselves, or evaporating in the same circumstances, will
remain uniform in size.          The disappearance of the supernume
rary bows near        the surface no doubt arises from the more dis
turbed current of air there causing the drops to encounter each
other and coalesce irregularly, so that some drops are produced
two or three times as large as the others.
    26. Distant showers of rain are often seen distinctly to evapo
rate, and sometimes entirely vanish during their fall; but 1 have
never observed or heard of a shower being observed to increase
in density visibly during its descent.
    27. It is now only right to add that both AragoI and Prof.
 Phillips have recorded unequivocally that a de<U+FB01>ciency of rain in
 the upper gauge occurs even during a perfect calm.                “'e have
already quoted one such observation by Prof. Phillips§ ; and two
others are found in his second paper on this subject“.                 Prof.
 Phillips, indeed,      considers   that falling   rain  itself  produces a
 downward current of air, which, it is just conceivable, might, by
 <U+FB02>owing over the sides of the upper rain-gauge or its support,
 de<U+FB02>ect the rain.        Again, while a perfect calm prevails on the
ground,     a  gentle  wind   is usually blowing at the top of a lofty
 tower. As my explanation of the de<U+FB01>ciency of rain in an elevated
 gauge is certainly inapplicable in a calm,            I  confess that my
 hearers must choose for themselves between considering two dis
 tinguished scienti<U+FB01>c observers capable of mistake in the observa
 tion of wind and calm on the one hand, and overturning some
 of the best established facts of physical science on the other hand.
   28. 1f the present explanation be accepted, all observations by
 rain-gauges      elevated or exposed to wind must be rejected as
 fallacious    and worse than useless.     But it is improbable that the
 error in a gauge with its month not more than one or two feet
 above the ground is worth considering.                Still I believe that
 during a heavy shower almost all gauges lose a little rain by
 splashing, and it is worthy of consideration whether more accu

 Arago argued upon some other view of the cause of this phenomenon,
 which has been much misunderstood.

rate means of estimation should not be adopted in regular obser
vatories.    The most unexceptionable rain»gauge would consist
of a sheet of metal, many feet square (for instance 10 feet),
spread <U+FB02>at upon the ground in an open place, with a <U+FB02>at col
lecting vessel in the centre connected by a pipe with a sunken
reservoir or recording apparatus.                The edges of the collecting
vessel should not be higher than an inch, so as to present no
appreciable obstacle or hollow space to the wind.                  At the same
time nothing would be lost by splashing, as the splashes within
and without the vessel Would be equal.
    29. My conclusions, shortly stated, are :—
    (1) An increase of the rainfall close to the earth’s surface is
incompatible with physical facts and laws.
    (2) The individual observations on this subject are utterly
discordant and devoid of law when separately examined, and the
process of taking an average under such circumstances gives an
 apparent uniformity which is entirely fallacious.
    (3) When daily measurements of rain, or even monthly totals,
 are examined with reference to the strength of the wind at the
 time, it becomes obvious that there is a connexion.
    (4) Wind must move with increased velocity in passing over
an obstacle.      It follows demonstratively that rain-drops falling
through such wind upon the windward part of the obstacle will
be further apart, in horizontal distance, than where the wind
is undisturbed and of ordinary velocity.

  LVI.      On  Earth-currents, and their    Connexion  with the Phe
      nomena    of Terrestrial Magnetism.     By  the Rev. H. LLOYD,
    _
      D.D., D.C.L.*
          the        1848  Mr. Barlow communicated        to the Royal'
   IN Societyyear paper
                  a        “On   the Spontaneous Electrical Currents
  observed in the \Vires of the Electric Telegraph,” in which he
  established the important fact, that a wire, whose extremities are
  connected with the earth at two distant points, is unceasingly
  traversed by electric currents, the intensity of which varies
  with the azimuth of the line joining the points of contact with
  the ground.       The direction of these currents was proved to be
  the same at both extremities of the same wire, and was shown
  to depend on the relative positions of the earth-connexions, while
  it was wholly independent of the course followed by the wire
  itself. The currents cease altogether when either of the contacts
  with the earth is interrupted. From these facts Mr. Barlow con
  cluded that “ the currents are terrestrial, of which a portion is
  conveyed along the wire, and rendered visible by the multiplying
  action of the coil of the magnetometer.”
      Mr. Barlow further observed that, apart from sudden and
J occasional changes, the general direction of the needle of the
  galvanometer appeared to exhibit some regularity. He was thus
  led to institute a series of observations for fourteen days and
  nights, on two wires simultaneously, one from Derby to Rugby,
   and the other from Derby to Birmingham, the positions of the
   needles in both circuits being recorded every <U+FB01>ve minutes, day and
  'night.     From these observations he concluded—
      “1. That the path described by the needle consisted of a
   regular diurnal motion, subject to disturbances of greater or less
   magnitude.
       “ 2. That this motion is due to electric currents passing from
   the northern to the southern extremities of the telegraph wires,
   and returning in the opposite direction.
       “ 3. That, exclusive of the irregular disturbances, the currents
   <U+FB02>owed in a southerly direction from about 8 or 9 AJL until the
   evening, and in a northerly direction during the remainder of the
  twenty-four hours.”
       He was thus led to examine whether any relation subsisted
  'between these movements and the daily changes of the horizontal
   magnetic needle.      And having made for this purpose a series of
   simultaneous observations with a delicate dcelinometer, he came
   to the conclusion, that although generally the currents <U+FB02>ow
                         that part of the day in which the variation of

during the night and early part of the morning), “ yet simulta
neous observations showed no similarity in the path described                        by
the magnetic needle and the galvanometer.”
    An examination of Mr. Barlow’s galvanometrie observations
 led me, some time since, to an opposite conclusion          and at the    ;
 last meeting of the British Association         stated my conviction,
                                                     I
 founded on these observations, that the earth-currents, whose
continuous <U+FB02>ow Mr. Barlow has the merit of establishing, would
 eventually explain all the changes of terrestrial magnetism, both
 periodic and irregular.      Inow proceed to state the grounds of
this conviction, and to show, from Mr. Barlow’s observations,
that the diurnal changes of the earth-currents correspond with
those of the horizontal component of the earth’s magnetic force*.
    Let us suppose, then, that the forces which act upon the hori
zontal needle, and which cause        itto deviate from its mean posi
tion, are due to electric currents traversing the upper strata of
the earth in     horizontal direction; and let
                    a                                 denote the inten
                                                           E
sity  of the current in  the  magnetic   meridian,  positive when <U+FB01>ow~
ing northwards,    and   vice versli  ;and    the1;intensity of the cur
rent perpendicular      to the magnetic meridian, positive when
<U+FB02>owing eastward, and vice versd.         Then the force of the current
in any direction, making the angle with the magnetic meridian

   * The <U+FB01>rst proof of acorrespondence between the magnetic variations,
and the changes of the earth-currents, seems to be due to Dr. Lamonto
Munich, in letter dated July 29, 1861, which was read by the Astronomer
               a
Royal at the last meeting of the British Association.       Dr. Lamont states
that he has found “ that electric currents, or (as they may be more pro
perly termed) eleclric waves, varying in direction or intensity, are constantly
passing at the surface of the earth, and that these waves correspond per
fectly with the variations of terrestrial magnetism."     The correspondence
here referred to seems to relate to the smaller and more rapid variations
of the terrestrial magnetic force. But in        letter to Prof. Heiss, dated
                                                 a
September      Dr. Lamont expresses his conviction that the whole diurnal
               1,
movements are due to these earth-currents.        He adds, however, that he
had hitherto been unable fully to verify this conclusion, owing to the con
tinunl changes produced in the collecting plates and in the wires by heat
and moisture.

    It will   be observed        that the changes indicated by these num
bers are very systematic.               In the wire connecting Derby and
Birmingham the current <U+FB02>ows southwards from 10 AJL to 10
P.M. inclusive, and nor/hwards during the remaining hours.                                In
the wire connecting Derby and Rugby the southward current
lasts from 10 A.M. to 8 Par. inclusive, and it is northward (with a
single exception) during the remaining hours.                         There are, how
ever, as might be expected in so short a series, some irregulari
ties in the course of the changes.                  In order to lessen these, and
at the same time to con<U+FB01>ne the results to such as are comparable
with the preceding,           I  have given (in the alternate columns of the
Table)    the   means     corresponding         to the alternate hours commen

                   quently divides the area of the diurnal curve unequally, being
                   considerably nearer to the night observations than to those of
                   the day.      If

                   ing amount, their agreement with the observed will be much
                   closer.

                   importance.     Magnetometric observations furnish merely di er
                   ential results, the magnitude and the sign of which have refer
                   ence solely to an arbitrary zero.   We are accordingly ignorant

                   pare them with their physical causes, whether real or supposed.
                   In    these respects the galvanometric observations have the ad

the absence of all currents, is indicated by the instrument itself;
the results therefore furnish the measures of the forces by which
they are produced.
     The next and most important step in this inquiry will be to
assign the physical cause of these phenomena.            The existence of
electric currents traversing the earth’s crust has hitherto been
maintained as a hypothesis, on account of its supposed adequacy
to explain the terrestrial magnetic changes.              Now, however,
 their existence is proved not only to be a fact, but also a fact
 suf<U+FB01>cient to explain the phenomena.           It remains therefore only
 to ascertain their source; and it will be for those who deny
 that the sun operates by its heat in producing the phenomena of
 terrestrial magnetism, to assign to these currents a more pro
 bable origin.
     P.S. While these pages were passing through the press, the
 writer received, by the kindness of Dr. Lamont, a copy of a
 further communication from him on the same subject, in a letter
 to Professor De la Rive, dated Oct. 10, 1861. In this letter, Dr.
 Lamont seems to recede from the view expressed in a former
 letter (see note, supra), and expresses his belief that the diurnal
 variations of terrestrial magnetism cannot be explained by the
 direct action of electric currents propagated on the earth’s sur
  face; and he advances the hypothesis, that the regular portion
  of these variations is due to a peculiar in<U+FB02>uence of the sun, their
  irregular <U+FB02>uctuations alone being caused by the earth-currents.
  These conclusions seem to be irreconcilable with Mr. Barlow’s
  observations, and are opposed to the inferences which            I have
  drawn from them in the preceding pages.
      The scienti<U+FB01>c public will therefore await with interest the de
  tailed publication of Dr. Lamont’s investigations on this im
  portant subject, in which, it may be hoped, he will give some
  clue to the explanation of this seeming discordance.

 mical or planetary bodies in question ; the one a large one (our
 own globe), and a comparatively      minute one (the meteorite).
 M. Leverrier, to wh0se talents and genius as an astronomer and
 mathematician we chie<U+FB02>y owe the discovery of the planet Nep
 tune, felt himself authorized to pronounce, before the Paris Aca
 demy (October 1, 1860), a view or suspicion which he himself
 designates as
                 “ strange at the <U+FB01>rst aspect, but
                                                    very possibly a
 reality*,” viz. that in comparatively recent times new and small
 planets have been formed out of planetary matter existing at
 different distances around the sun, and possessing various de
grees of density and volumeT,       but that their existence had
remained unperceived till, during the last few years, the extra
ordinary amount of attention bestowed on the subject had at
length been rewarded by a number of discoveries i.
    The original formation and constitution of cosmical bodies have
of late become the subject of the most diversi<U+FB01>ed consideration.
Some have tried to develope peculiarities previously more or less
neglected ; others (as my respected friend Prof. C. F. Neumann,
in his classical ‘ Manual of Geology,’ chapter on the Temperature
of the Interior of the Globe, 2nd edit. 1857, vol. i. p. 36) have
endeavoured to treat the question in a lucid and exhaustive
synopsis, and to collect into a whole the opinions of men of the

mass of matter would probably have been observed before this, either in
transit over the Sun’s disc, or during total eclipses of the Sun,   if  itexisted
as one large planet, M. Leverrier supposes that        exists as
                                                           it   a series of aste
roids.    Secondly, M. Leverrier sees reason to believe that there must be a
mass of matter, equal to about one-tenth of the mass of the Earth, revol
ving around the Sun at very nearly the same distance as the Earth. This
also he supposes split up into an immense number of asteroids             meteo
                                                                         [?
rites].   Thirdly, M. Leverrier’s researches have led him to the conclusion
that the group of asteroids which revolve between Mars and Jupiter, sixty
of which have already been seen and named, and had their elements deter
mined, must have an aggregate mass equal to one-third of that of the
Earth.     He likewise thinks   it   not unlikely that similar groups of aste
                                     is
roids exist between Jupiter and Saturn, Saturn and Uranus, and between
Uranus and Neptune.”        See also Cosmos for June l861,p. 639.—R. P. G.

441     M. Haidinger    on the  Original Formation of Ae'rolites.
highest authority, rather for the purpose of respectful study, than
to be made the subject of control or contradiction.        Proceeding
from simple correlations,      I humbly venture to enunciate some
few considerations respecting the formation of meteorites, which,
eminently diversi<U+FB01>ed as they are if taken individually,        I  must
yet consider, along with Sir David Brewster, Prof. Laurence
Smith, and other naturalists, to be fragments of a larger or more
voluminous body.
    The formation of crystals requires a movement of molecules.
This is a general and most irrefragable theorem.              \Ve see
crystals deposited   from  gaseous  and  liquid solutions, or wherever
the single molecules have acquired mobility under the in<U+FB02>uence
of high temperature, as in substances in a state of fusion.
   Whenever solid bodies are undergoing metamorphic changes,
crystals form out of pulverulent, as well as out of relatively solid
substances, when they undergo in<U+FB02>uences that make their inti
mate particles moveable.        We do not know that crystallization
can take place under any other circumstances, so long as the laws
of nature, as now known to us, remain in force. We are entitled
therefore to conclude that these bodies, coming from cosmical
space into our atmosphere, took their point of departure from
matter either in a gaseous, liquid, or pulverulent condition. The
real point of departure then is matter in the form of an impal
pable powder, assumed to be the initial deposit of any substance
suspended in a gaseous or liquid solution.
    Meteoric stones, almost pulverulent in their nature, with opake,
nearly earthy fracture (as those of Reichenbach’ s second family),
others whitish, without rounded particles, or dark-coloured (as
those of Bokkeveld), are connected, by a long series of inter
mediate forms, with the highly crystalline meteorites of Chas
signy, Juvenas, Shalka, and the solid compact ones of Seres,
Tabor, Chantonnay, Segowlee, Parnallee, &c. In the same way
a long series of structural transitions connect the non-crystalline
meteoric irons of the Cape of Good Hope and Hemalga with the
beautifully crystalline varieties of Agram, Elbogen, Lenarto,
Lockport, Red River, Nebraska, ending with the most perfect
type, that of Braunau.      The crystals of olivine contained in the
meteorites of Hainholz, Brahin, Atacama, and Krasnojarsk prove
the power of crystallization to have remained active during along
period of time.
    With our present knowledge of natural laws, these character
istically crystalline formations could not possibly have come
into existence except under the action of high temperature com
bined with powerful pressure; though we have to search in vain
for a heated cosmical space, as supposed by Poisson.
    If we suppose within the glacial cold of space the existence of

 a  pulverulent aggregate of all the substances found in meteorites,
 these could not be brought to crystallize gradually without some
 means or source by which heat could subsequently act upon them;
 and it may be questionable how far the mutual pressure of masses,
 or the attraction of a great whole on its isolated and still uncon
 nected particles, may possibly suf<U+FB01>ce to produce such an effect.
    I may here anticipate that a mere pulverulent aggregate having
 a rotatory movement in space must necessarily also acquire a sphe
 roidal form dependent upon rotation, exactly like a liquid (accord
 ing to Professor Plateau’s experiments) not acted on by terres
 trial attraction, and consequently in a state of free suspension.
     A sqztaria, an object familiar to mineralogists and geologists,
 may serve to convey an idea of the effects of pressure acting from
 the circumference to the centre. Septaria: are spheroidal tuberi
 form bodies, occasionally slightly compressed in one direction
 (see <U+FB01>g 3), consisting of an external solid shell or crust of com
 pact argillaceous sphaerosiderite, <U+FB01>lled up with the same sub
 stance, and intersected by numerous and somewhat imperfect
 veins of calcareous and magnesio-calcareous       spar.  Fig 3 is an
autotype,    taken  from  a specimen    in the Imperial  Museum     of
                                Fig. 3.
Vienna.      The formation of such a septaria may be explained as
follows :—within a stratum of clay, the particles richest m the
carbonate of oxide of iron agglomerate or coalesce: the clay.

446      M. Haidinger   on the  Original Formation of Ae'roliles.
stratum,    and with it the sphaerosideritic agglomeration, under
goes pressure, which, if suf<U+FB01>cient, leaves in the interior a softer
portion, more impregnated with water than the external crust
from which that element has been squeezed more completely out.
The sphzerosiderite is naturally inclined to assume throughout
the consistence of the external crust, which, like a vault or arch,
acts in every direction against further contraction.              Contrac
tion ensues,    and the <U+FB01>ssures  produced   in  consequence are subse
quently <U+FB01>lled up with crystalline deposits of substances held in
solution by liquids penetrating, or already contained within, the
interstices.     At <U+FB01>rst magnesian carbonate of lime, then calca
 reous spar (occasionally also iron pyrites) are separated and
 deposited.     Certainly there seems to exist a great analogy
 between the process of formation of such septariaa and that
 admissible as going on within a large pulverulent globe freely
 suspended in space.      There is indeed no external pressure, but
 every stratum of ponderable matter exercises compression on the
 whole.
    The following <U+FB01>gure (<U+FB01>g. 4) is taken from Professor C. Koppe’s
 “                             ”
     Physik und Meteorologie      (in B'adeker’ s collective publication,
 Die gesammten Naturwissenschaften).           A point A, attracted at
 the surface by a material point B as a sum of many others,
 undergoes also attraction from another point D in a similar
 situation. The resulting line of direction falls between B and
 D, and passes through the centre C, along the line C E.
      No determinate direction could pre

  As each particle on the surface tends to
  sink towards the centre, it <U+FB01>nds an ob

  meteorites are oxygen, sulphur, phosphorus, carbon, chromium,
  silicium, hydrogen, cobalt, nickel, iron, aluminium, magnesium,
  calcium, potassium,—all of them extremely discrepant in density
  and other physical qualities.      It is doubtful whether these ex
   isted as elementary particles, or in chemical combinations.           In

the present     case, that <U+FB01>rst supposed may in reality have been
precedent     to the second mode or condition of existence.
    Such a supposition may be considered more admissible than
the views now more prevalent, that cosmical space possessed such
an elevated temperature that the whole of matter existed in a
<U+FB01>m
gaseous state at the _ rate (as Vogt has calculated*) of only
              ths of a        W1th1n the space of one cubic (German)
                        gram
mile. Such a supposition, however, lies far beyond us as regards
experimental proof, even should we succeed, by connecting the
past with the present, in producing correlations that might com
paratively be considered “initial” ones.          If  the heavier metallic
particles tend downwards along with others of less density which
are pushed aside or even forced to ascend, while the whole sur
face pressing towards the centre is consequently continually
diminishing in bulk, friction must unavoidably follow, and with
it (as experience teaches) development of electricity and heat.
We are, however, suf<U+FB01>ciently acquainted with the phenomena
attending the mutual combination of several among the above
named substances, as connected with combustion, oxidation, and
chemical action in general, to enable us to pursue this part of
our examination further.
     On a former occasion (in “ eine Leitform der Meteoriten,” &c.,
 Imp. Acad. Proceedings, vol. xl. p. 539)           I  mentioned an im
portant communication from my respected colleague, Professor
 Schrb'tter, concerning the fact that substances whose mutual
action under ordinary temperature goes on violently and with
every appearance of intense combustion (as chlorine acting upon
phosphorus, antimony, arsenic, or ammonia), when refrigerated to
  —80° in a mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether (so that
 chlorine is liqui<U+FB01>ed under ordinary barometric pressure), remain
 in a state of complete mutual indifference.         Under these circum
 stances, a slight elevation of temperature, especially if care has
 not been taken to keep up a low temperature by rapid evapora
tion, may be the cause of dangerous explosions.
     The same is the case with alcohol and chromic or chloro
 chromic acid, with ammonia and chloride of phosphorus, with
 iodine or bromine and phosphorus (see Professor Schrotter’s Die
  Clu'mie nach ihrem gegenwa'rtigen Zustanrle, $0., Vienna, 1847
 vol. i. p. 129).      Professor Dumas reported on this fact in the
 Paris Academy (Comptcs Rendus, January 1845, No. 3, p. 193),
 remarking that he had not been able to observe a complete in
 activity,-—probably, as Professor Schriitter new objects, because,

elevation of temperature in conducting the experiment took
place too rapidly.
    When chemical action has once commenced, a continuous
increase of temperature easily takes place, till, beneath the upper
most dry and pulverulent surface still exposed to the intense
cold of cosmical space, a crust or shell has been formed, within
which the atoms of matter, following the in<U+FB02>uence of their own
peculiar forces and properties, unite in chemical combinations,
and individualize themselves into separate crystals whose elevated
temperature (chemical action having eeased) effects more or less
lithoid consistence.
     The attempts to explain the central heat of the Earth by means
of electrical and chemical action come near the views enounced
 by Sir Charles Lyell, Prof. De la Rive, Ste. (see Naumann, loc.
 cit. p. 63), while the compressive action of the uppermost terres
 trial strata, here taken for a point of departure, is quite adequate
 to the conditions required by an uninterrupted process of induc
 tion. The above-named mobility of particles once admitted, the
 frequent occurrence of globules in meteorites is no longer a mat
 ter of surprise.        These globules, sometimes rather regularly
 rounded (as in some oolites), and in other cases angular or frag
 mentary (with edges occasionally rounded at the same time,
 however), are imbedded in an agglomeration of looser and fre
 quently arenaeeous particles, for which      I have proposed the name
 of “meteoric tufa*.”         The surface of these globules is charac
 teristicall surrounded with particles of iron, as in the meteo
 rites of     eres, Assam, Renazzo, Parnallee, and others.           The
 meteorites presenting the aspect of crystalline rocks unmixed
 with native iron, as in those of Chassigny, Juvenas, Shalka,
  &c., stand far higher in the scale of development than even
  those most compact meteorites which include minute particles
  of metallic iron dispersed through an arenaeeous, granular,
  or tufaceous aggregate of lithoid substance.        The highest stage
  of development is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the pure and highly crystalline
  meteoric irons, partially resembling the contents of metalliferous
  veins (as in the Agram iron), and partly surrounded in all direc
  tions with smooth surfaces, a still unexplained circumstance even
  if super<U+FB01>cial oxidation during their progress through the terres
  trial atmosphere is taken into account.        Instances of a vein-like
  disposition   of  metallic iron  (as in the Macao   meteoric stone), or
  of iron pyrites (in those of Pegu, Allahabad), as well as genuine
  planes of <U+FB01>ssure (Stannern), rough (Allahabad), or specular
   (Ensisheim, Lixna, Ste), exactly like those in our terrestrial
  rocks, are of no rare occurrence in many meteorites.           The me

      the more    intimate atoms   of  “cosmical  dust,”—though, and this
     is   the very foundation of either mode of consideration, this took
      place not within the vaporous dust freely dispersed through cos
      mical space, but within an already pre-existent and voluminous
      agglomeration, in which mutual attraction only became effective
      by   producing real or absolute pressure.       Ireally feel obliged to
      Baron Reichenbach for these statements, although undertaken
       with other intentions than to illustrate my own views on this
     matter.
        The in<U+FB02>uence of solar heat has purposely been neglected in
     the preceding considerations, on account of the want of an atmo
     sphere, in the strict sense of the term, in those spaces within
     which the formation of meteorites (in their initial condition or
     movement) may be admitted to take place. We know the tem
     perature of planetary space to be far below that of the freezing
     point, and we may assume an identical condition for the entire
     orbit of our globe, with radius of 95,000,000 miles, as well as
                                    a

where probably more than one planet, and certainly comets, are
pursuing their course, the solar distance of Neptune being itself
only 7U'tmth of the interval between the Sun and the nearest <U+FB01>xed
star*.       During the period which the Earth takes to accomplish
her annual revolution round the Sun, the latter, together with
the whole solar system, has progressed (at the rate of about seven
German miles a second) through a space of which the Earth’s
distance from the Sun is only the eleventh part'f.                 Professor
KoppeI says, “ All circumstances agree in con<U+FB01>rming the up
position that, for a period of 3300 years, the average tempera
ture of Palestine        has not undergone any notable change.”
During this period our globe has run in length some 36,300
times its own distance from the Sun—a course not to be achieved
by light itself in less than 209 days, though this enormous di
stance is small indecd compared with the unlimited range of
space    itself !
    Taking for granted that the weight of meteorites falling upon
our earth’s surface amounts yearly to 450,000 lbs. (Vienna
weight), if not                  and consequently to 450 millions of
pounds      in a       more?
                  millennia    period, Baron Reichcnbach has brought
under consideration the question, whether in the course of ages
such an increase of ponderable matter would not be without
notable in<U+FB02>uence on other as well as physical correlations con
nected with our globe in the solar systeml . The length of such
periods as are here taken into account is after all almost too enor
mous for our imagination to grasp: to accomplish the formation
of a meteoric agglomeration equal in size to our globe would
require 3000 trillions of years.
    Another consideration, however, may here <U+FB01>nd appropriate
notice.      We may ask, if then our globe in the course of one solar
revolution can thus admit of an increase of matter to the amount
of 450,000 lbs., what would have ensued if it had followed a dif
ferent path through space? Might not the increase have been
nearly similar in amount in describing any orbit of equal length ?

to be less frequent at the time of perihelion than at the time of

“ Callum’s drops or globules.” Professor T. H. Newton of Yale
College, New Haven, Conn. U.S., says (New York Tribune, Au
gust  22, 1860), “ it is calculated from       reliable observa
                                                 perfectly
tion, that not       than 10 millions of meteors enter the atmo
                       less
 sphere every day,  and  are burnt up*.”
    This would then be 3650 millions per annum, which would
 again materially increase the total amount of meteoric matter
 contained within the above-mentioned space.      But is there not
 some probability that beyond our own system of <U+FB01>xed stars, all
 space is replete with such bodies, of which only a proportional
minimum, and that transitorily, make up part of our own solar
 system?    Not that all of them may be burned away or melted;
for the large 4 lb. stone of Segowlee, described by me, has its
edges quite sharp and nearly unaltered, some of them being
rounded only to a depth of not quite one-twelfth of an inch.
 Meteorites composed of less dense matter, while moving rapidly,
may be frequently again repelled into space by the resistance of
compressed air.     For this reason meteorites of earthy or carbo
naccous like consistence, as those of Bokkeveld, Alais, &c., are
of particular importance, as well as rare.      Meteorites are far
behind our terrestrial rocks with regard to diversity of mineralo
gical character.   The minerals composing granite, gneiss, mica
schist, and others, representing the most solid basis of the terres
trial crust, are wanting in them; and, to name a particularly
important species, they are totally destitute of pure silica or
quartz     1‘.
  " If,  as I presume he does, Prof. Newton means that this represents the
total number of meteors which enter our atmosphere daily, and that all
these are, as     amatter of course, consumed in it,  I  think heis   mistaken,
the number of meteors so consumed being in all robability limited to such
only as burst or become dissipated in sparks.     T  ese form but a  small por
tion of those that apparently <U+FB02>y almost instantaneously through the upper
strata of the air (at an average height of 65 miles. as recently proved by
Prof. Secchi at Rome), and pass off again, perhaps tangentially, into inter
planetary    race.
             s       Prof. Vaughan of Cincinnati, U.S., thinks    it  probable
that the so     nucleus of an ordinary shooting-star
                 id                                   is no bigger than    hail
                                                                           a
stone; and this       only analogous to what takes place with large aerolitic
                      is
meteors.    There are cases of large and well-observed meteors, which after
bursting. sometimes even with noise, into two or more parts at         a height
of 40 miles or so, have undoubtedly again passed into planetary space,
—another proof also that the smaller shooting-stars may do the same.
  It  must not be forgotten in these rather speculative calculations, that the
same groups of meteors may frequently repeat themselves, that is. return
periodically without visible or material loss, and that, in fact,     byfar the
greater number of meteors seen are doubtless those that are periodical
and consequently belong to our own system.         Unless  itcan be otherwise
          it       seem premature to suppose              than  that by far the

     The subject of progressive changes in the world of meteorites,
as hitherto exempli<U+FB01>ed by specimens within our knowledge, is
thus for the present con<U+FB01>ned within narrow limits. Are these
 progressive changes of a character likely to terminate the proper
existence of a celestial body by its de<U+FB01>nitive division into frag
 ments? or is the possibility of such a “breaking up ” justi<U+FB01>ed
 by any precedent not opposed to the laws of nature as known to
 us? A few considerations made from this point of view may
 serve to supply a real desideratum.
     I intend to sketch them here as brie<U+FB02>y as possible, taking my
 point of de arture from a septaria, whose constitution              I  have
already explained.          As in such a terrestrial concretion, so the
 outward crust of a cosmical body may become solid, presenting
a stony appearance, under the centripetal pressure of gravitation,
 long before its interior has undergone a like degree of compres
 sion.    I take our own globe as a point of comparison for data
expressed in <U+FB01>gures.           Originally the particles of the solid ter
restrial crust lying next each other may possibly have enjoyed a
 certain amount of mobility; this of course no longer exists. The
 maximum of pressure has its seat at a depth where the greater
and more solid mass rests on the interior compressed by it In a
descending direction.          We are entitled to suppose this under
lying mass is maintained by this very pressure in a state of in
candescent fusion.           Atmospheric pressure represented by the
weight    of  a column     of water 32 feet high, amounts to 18048
lbs. per square foot.         A column of 10 feet average height of any
substance whose speci<U+FB01>c gravity is = 3'0, acts-near]               with the
same degree of force. At the height of 1 German mi e (24,000
feet) the pressure is =2400 atmospheres; at 5 miles (25 miles
English) (a measure generally adopted to express the solid ter
restrial crust*) it would amount to no less than 12,000 atmo
spheres.      A solid pressing on our globe. with the weight of 1 lb.
would in the Moon press only with {‘3 1b., and if transported on
to the Sun’s surface with 28% lbs.1'          The pressure produced on
Rose of Berlin, has proved beyond doubt the occurrence of uartz in iso
lated crystals in the meteoric iron of Ziquipilco (Toluea).—-   . H.
   It may be here mentioned that Berzelius, Rammelsberg, and Dr. Lau
rence Smith have pointed out strongly and with much truth, the general
resemblance that meteorites. in whole or part, not unfrequently bear to cer
tain volcanic rocks. See Dr. Buchner’s work, Die Feuermeteorc insbesondere
Meteoriten, ($0., p. 175.—R. P. G.
   ‘   Important and more recent researches on the question of the thickness
of the earth’s crust, as conducted by Professor Hopkins and others in this
country, may necessitate our raising M. Haidinger’s estimate of only 25
miles of a solid crust to something like a minimum of 300 miles.      This is
more a question of degree, however, and does not materially affect M. Hai
dinger's line of argument—R. P. G.

our globe by a solid crust of 5 German miles thick, would require
in the Moon a crust of 32$ miles in thickness, and in the Sun
a crust of only T37 of a mile thick, or 4235 feet.
     Original pressure takes place only so long as a body is not
 completely solidi<U+FB01>ed; from that moment perfect equilibrium is
 established within it; pressure, however, must again take place
 whenever change of temperature modi<U+FB01>es the state of rigidity.
 A rigid body is always apt to conduct heat. That kind of heat
 whose laws of increase we have to deal with while pursuing in
 vestigations on the central heat of the Earth, is conducted heat,
 transmitted from heat generated, or existing, at greater depths, as
 more immediately shown by volcanic eruptions.             In the regions
 where volcanic vents open in great numbers on the surface, “the
 smelted interior of our planet,” as Humboldt emphatically says,
 “stands most in permanent communication with the atmo
 sphere.”      In our times this region is a zone between 75° W. and
 125° E. long. of Paris, and 47° S. to 66° N. lat., running N.W.
 in the western portion of the Southern Ocean*.                It deserves
 consideration, that the whole continent          of  the  Old World lies
 westward of this zone, separated from it towards the south-west
 only by the Indian Ocean, offering eastwards (as in the Southern
 Ocean itself) considerable “ areas of subsidence-t,”              and that
 towards the east of the Southern Ocean the American continent
 is again fringed with a series of active volcanoes.        A remarkable
 connexion exists between these circumstances and the fact that
 the altitude of atmospheric strata at the same time rapidly de
 creases as we approach the antarctic pole,——just as though a mass
 of solid highlands had in those parts pressed on the interior of
 the globe at some early period of its existence, and the terrestrial
 crust had been broken, and its parts mutually dislocated into the
 general and more marked outlines now visible on its surface.
 Should the solidi<U+FB01>cation of the crust proceed so far as to become
 stationary before the particles of primitive cosmical matter en
 closed in it have completed their approximation, these might
 indeed commence a new and independent process of formation,
 giving rise to a second shell concentric with the <U+FB01>rst or external
 one, and enclosing another internal focus of volcanic activity, the
 primitive one having become meanwhile extinct.

there would, at all events, remain an interior space of 403 miles,
within which the formation of another such spherical shell might
possibly proceed.     Nevertheless it is not to be expected that
further condensation out of the primitive molecular state should
go on without some disturbance in a medium of such a tempera
ture as prevails in planetary space.                   If
                                           contraction produces an
actual internal vacuum, a violent disruption of the crust falls
within the bounds of possibility. Admitting that a compensa
 tion of temperature by conduction or communication of heat to
 have already taken place, and supposing every solid shell to be
 hermetically sealed under a high temperature, an event quite op
 posite to the above-mentioned one might be expected with some
 degree of probability.     Gases developed within this shell and
 brought to high tension, might indeed cause a violent explosion,
 exactly like that arising from ignited gunpowder enclosed within
a  hollow projectile.
    What is the actual cause of the densities of the planetary
bodies within our solar system being so different from each
other? Does it merely arise from the natural correlation of the
elements composing them, as in our globe, or from a progressive
development in the earlier stages of their existence?     The den
sities of these bodies are expressed by the following numbers :—
Mercury, 6'71 ; Earth, 5'44; Mars, 5'15; Venus, 5'02; the
Moon, 3'37; Sun, 1'37; Jupiter, 1'29; Neptune, 1'2; Uranus,

the intensity of an explosive force suf<U+FB01>cient to rend a planet into

to a comet. He found that an impulsion equal to the velocity of
a cannon-ball      multiplied by 12—15, that is 16,800—21,000
 feet per second (the velocity of a cannon-ball being 1400 feet a
 second, and equal to that of a point at the equator in its
 diurnal rotation), would be suf<U+FB01>cient to throw the fragments of a
 planet (the radius of its orbit being supposed to be equal to the
 distance of our globe from the Sun multiplied by 100) into pro
 gressive or retrogressive, elliptical or parabolical comet-orbits—
 the greater number of them even into hyperbolical ones, so that,
 after their <U+FB01>rst perihelion, they would disappear for ever from our
 system      1'.

456       M. Haidinger      on the  Original Formation of Aerolites.
    Certainly there is great dif<U+FB01>culty in forming an idea where and
how fragments of genuine solid rocks (as meteorites undoubtedly
are) could be <U+FB01>rst violently broken from their parent repository
and then hurled into distant solar systems; nevertheless their
characteristic fragmentary form, together with the cosmical velo
city of their course, leaves no room for any other solution. So
daring a supposition, paying, however, due attention to Nature’s
laws as far as they are known to us, must, however, from time to
time, provoke reiterated criticism.
    I thought it desirable therefore to give here a short conspectus
of such views concerning meteoric phenomena               as have from time
to time crossed my mind, or been the subject of distinct commu
nications to the Academy, though at the same time I freely
          I
admit may have been intruding into a region of natural science
                                      I
for the investigation of which am but very imperfectly prepared.
I must ask for some indulgence in this attempt to trace the out
lines of views in some way different from current ones—the more
so since they are intended to establish             merely a kind of pro
gramme for more accurate investigations.
    In an earlier period of development in human society, the
“ nonum prematur in annum”
                                          may have been more easily
obeyed      than   it is in  our  times.   Accelerated publication, how
ever, has also its advantages, as contemporaneous investigators
familiarized with the matter <U+FB01>nd in it a point of comparison for
their own either analogous or contradictory views.               For myself,
some portion or other of myviews have been more than once the
subject of conversation and epistolary intercourse.
                I        I
    At least hope may have been successful in my endeavours
to follow the strict rules of scienti<U+FB01>c induction for arriving at
the result aimed at in this paper.           During the whole course of
these considerations         I have made it my duty implicitly to obey
the precept of our great master, Humboldt, that, “even within
merely conjectural regions, uncontroled or arbitrary opinions,
independent of induction, should never be allowed to prevail.”
   Note.—Bnron Reichenbach’s estimate of an annual meteoric de
posit on the surface of our globe, amounting to 450,000 (Vienna)
pounds, is certainly considerably over the mark. In his paper on this
             have been condensed from comet-dust; that this is quite contrary
origiinally
to     . Haidinger’s  opinion, I have good reason to believe.  It may perhaps
appear a little dif<U+FB01>cult to believe that, were any small planet or satellite of
a planet to burst, some of the fragments would for ever be hurled
beyond the in<U+FB02>uence of the sun,—though,        as in the case possibly of the
sixty asteroids, the original orbital conditions of the parent mass might
become a good deal modi<U+FB01>ed—R. P. G.

subject (see Poggendor<U+FB02>' ‘s Annalen, vol. cv. p. 554 et seq.) he calcu
lates there are 4500 meteoric falls per annum, averaging lOO lbs.
per fall in weight. Assuming, as we perhaps may do, that he has not
materially over-estimated the weight of each fall, he has certainly
exaggerated their annual number.        Supposing, in the <U+FB01>rst place, as
I believe we may, that detonating meteors are equally aerolitic,
whether stones are picked up or not, since most meteoric stones have
resulted from a detonating meteor in the <U+FB01>rst instance, then for the
last sixty years, over an area of 900,000 square miles, comprising
the countries of Great Britain and Ireland, France, Germany (inclu
 sive of Austria, Prussia, Hungary, &c.), and Italy, we <U+FB01>nd recorded
            “ Catalogue of Meteorites and Meteors " in the last volume
 (see my
of the British Association Report for the Oxford Meeting, p. 48)
sirty-nine actual stone-falls, and seventy-two meteors accompanied
with detonations from which no material residuum was obtained;
say in all 144 cases of aiirolitic phenomena. That is about 2%,
recorded instances per annum for an area of 900,000 square miles;
 and taking the super<U+FB01>cial area of the whole globe at 197,000,000
square miles, we obtain rather over <U+FB01>ve hundred falls (511) as the
number likely to be observed, were all the world covered by land and
 peopled in like manner by Europeans.
    Now, what proportion this number would bear to those that abso
 lutely do fall annually, but which are never noticed or not recorded in.
 scienti<U+FB01>c works, it is not very easy to say; but from various reasons
 it may be fairly estimated at more than half of the entire number.
 Chladni and Humboldt have estimated the total number at 700.
     There are several reasons for inducing us to increase the annual
 number of observed and recorded falls, viz. 500, to 800 or 900, as the
 actual number that fall, and not more. First, the fact that one-half
 the human race are supposed to be asleep or in their houses nearly
 twelve hours out of the twenty-four, must tend to limit considerably
 the number of observations; on the other hand, we are not without
  instances of stone-falls and other aérolitic phenomena, detonating
 meteors more especially, occurring during the night-time; while again,
 as I have shown in the tabulated results of my large Catalogue, p.118,
  the greatest number of stone-falls seem to occur in the afternoon
 about 4 o’clock, not only as against falls _taking place during the
  night, but as compared even with the corresponding hours in the
 forenoon, equally favourable as a time for such observations. Though
 stones have not frequently been picked up during the night-time, we
 may bear in mind that the night is a most favourable time for seeing
 large and brilliant aerolitic meteors, and that the darkness does not
 prevent us from hearing the violent detonations usually accompauy~
 ing the explosion of an acrolitic meteor. Then, again, it is not
 unusual for an a'érolitic meteor to pass overhead some hundreds
 of miles, and for the detonation to be heard over from twenty to
  forty miles square ; and some persons would probably notice one or
  the other;     Now as I have included as aé'ralitic, meteors from
  which no stones have been picked up, it will I think be admitted

time either seen a meteoric stone fall, or even heard the always vio-~
lent detonation of an exploding a'erolitic meteors There seems to
have been of the latter only three instances recorded as observed in
England during the last ten years, and no well-authenticated instance
of a meteoric-stone fall since 1835, and that a single one of about
2 lbs. in weight!     To know whether a meteoric stone has fallen, it
is then not exactly necessary to calculate the proportions of waste or
forest ground, &c. that exists even in Europe, as Baron Reichenbach
argues, in order to arrive at the number of stones not picked up, if
we assume that aerolitie detonating meteors are seen and heard as a
rule over very large areas, and count as actual falls in our calcula
tions.   So striking indeed are the phenomena usually attending the
fall and appearance of aerolites and ac'rolitic meteors, that I much
question whether fully two-thirds of the real number would not cer
tainly be recorded in the daily or scienti<U+FB01>c journals, say of England
and France.     Instead, therefore, of placing the total weight of me
teoric matter annually deposited on the earth as high as 450,000 lba.,
as calculated by Baron Reichenbach, I am inclined to estimate it
at probably less than 100,000 lbs. This is, however, more a ques-‘
tion of degree, and does not vitally affect the ulterior argument in
volved in the problem proposed by Baron Reichenbach and M. Hai
dinger—a problem not without importance and interest, though
somewhat speculative.—R.P.G.

ccelorum of the ancients, which was supposed to <U+FB01>ll the world,
after the manner of the extension of the atmosphere of             central,             a
body; and since the time of Newton, its existence has only been
upheld for the purpose of conserving the conception of gravita
tion, as the one governing force of the universe.                But this
 singular hypothesis ought to have vanished when Laplace made
known the de<U+FB01>nite limits which mechanics imposes on the

ceasing to gravitate towards the sun, the beds of this medium

therefore becomes requisite to attribute to the medium a constant
density in space.      Unfortunately, in this case, the beautiful
agreement above alluded to between calculation and observation
will disappear; for instead of 34”'6, the formula of M. Plans
for this hypothesis will not give more than 141' ; and, moreover,
there still remains to apply to this medium a velocity of trans
lation equal and contrary to that which transports the masses of
the solar system in inde<U+FB01>nite space.

   It is along time ago, says M. Faye, since <U+FB01>rst advanced
this objection: no one has ever been able to answer it; and,‘
notwithstanding, the hypothesis of an immoveablc medium is
persisted in.    Can it be then that in itself the immobility or
the movement of the medium is a thing of no consequence?
                                                                        ‘
This is what we are going to see.
   Let us accept, then, continues M. Faye, the very different
hypothesis of a medium revolving around the sun.             It is then
evident that such a'mcdium can onl resist the motion of comets
in virtue of the excess of velocity. This excess, positive at peri
helion, becomes negative at aphelion ; consequently if the medium
resists in the one case, it will push in the other.      This circum
stance alonc is suf<U+FB01>cient to show that the analysis of this new
problem cannot be identi<U+FB01>ed with that of the <U+FB01>rst.           It indeed
involves more than this; for what then will become of the law
of density? No one can tell. When the medium was regarded
as immoveablc, it was admitted that its beds, in gravitating the
one on the other and on the sun, would be mutually com
pressed in such a manner that the density would progress
ively increase towards the interior, according to the law approxi
mately represented     by      But when the medium revolves, it
ceases  to gravitate,  not only towards, but on the sun; its beds
cease  to press upon each other and the law of density becomes
a perfectly inde<U+FB01>nite problem.                                     _
   M. Faye then gives some analyses for the periodical comet of
seven years which bears his name; the result of which is 2' 40",
instead of 34'"6 as given by observation.       From this enormous
discordance, he says, it must be concluded that a continuous
ring of constant density is inadmissible.     It is necessary, therc_
fore, that the density of the medium should vary according to a
peculiar law.     Thus Encke’s comet requires that this density
should go on rapidly decreasing outside the orbit of Mercury,

               Resisting Medium and a    quLsive  Force.         461
 within which orbit the perihelion of this comet occurs. Again, the
 comet of seven years likewise requires, no less imperiously, that
 the density of such a ring should be well marked in the region
 of the orbit of Mars, rapidly decreasing in such a manner as to
 become imperceptible on approaching the orbit of Jupiter; for
 it is between these orbits that the motions of this remarkable
 comet are accomplished.      These conditions can only be recon
 ciled by adopting for the resisting medium a series of cosmical
 rings more or less resembling those of Saturn, but separated
 from one another by great intervals.
    Such, in the opinion of M. Faye, is the only form under which
 the hypothesis of a resisting medium can be hereafter main
tained.    But he adds that nothing can be more inde<U+FB01>nite than
 such a hypothesis; for the number of such rings, their respec~
tive limits, and the law of their interior density are completely
arbitrary. It is impossible, for example, to extract from it any
relation between 811, or 8; and 3¢, on which, however, all the
memoir of M. Plana proceeds.
    In this manner, says M. Faye, the two <U+FB01>rst parts of his
thesis have been justi<U+FB01>ed: it has been shown that an immoveable
medium is impossible; that a revolving medium is an inde<U+FB01>nite
hypothesis with which analysis can have no concern; and that a
series of cosmical rings is so fanciful that such a hypothesis must
be ranked with the transparent crystalline heavens and with the
Cartesian vortices.     And he lastly proceeds to the consideration
of his theory of a repulsive force.
    The several successive returns of the comet of three years have
taught us that the duration of its revolution is constantly dimi
nishing, whilst the other elements of its orbit remain unaltered.
This is a most important fact; and Enckc, the author of this
great discovery, has concluded therefrom the existence of a force
which is constantly opposed to the motion of the comet, and
which therefore results in the comet’s successive acceleration,
without affecting its other elements, save the eccentricity.    But
this repulsive tangential force, is it real or apparent? If it be a
real force, it may be asked what such a force can be which is
able to contend in the heavens with gravitation, and thus to
break the unity of astronomical       science.  Encke has declared
for an apparent force, originating in the resistance of a medium;
it was, it may be supposed, merely for the conservation of this
threatened unity.       It is doubtless an enlightened view, but
arbitrary; for the unity of force is not, it is presumed, a scien
ti<U+FB01>c dogma.       Let us then reserve our judgment concerning
the nature of this repulsive force.                              _
    In studying, says M. Faye, the astonishing _ forms whlch
comets present, their gigantic tails, the matter which they seem

    founded with the tail, &e., all the world will naturally say that
    such things come to pass because the "sun exercises a repulsive
    action upon the atmosphere of the comets.                        Some will have  .it
 'that this repulsive action                 is due to electricity, and,others to
.-  magnetism, 'without once re<U+FB02>ecting that these forces, so préci'se
 . when       applied to terrestrial phenomena, are vague and little
 lunderstood in relation to celestial bodies.                      Others, again, have
 _ spoken       of  an  apparent     repulsion;         was
                                                       it      the  idea of Hooke and
    of Newton. Bessel, after             a   very profound study of certain phe
    nomena, which he has, however, too much generalized, can Only
 . see in these cometary forms the effects                 of polar forces analogous
    to magnetism.           But to form an opinion concerning the nature
  , of such    a   force, one single order of facts                not suf<U+FB01>cient for
                                                                     is        ;    it

                                         ;                       radial repulsive force,

     indicated     by   their  tails:   on    one    hand,    Eneke   with the ancient

I    hypothesis of        a  resisting medium for the explanation of the
  _;former force; on the other, Bessel with his polar forces to
   account for the latter.              A  discussion, short but memorable, took
              between these great astronomers.                   Bessel, who did not
  \place
       elieve more than myself in a resisting medium, referred every
     thing to his radial forces; Encke, on the other hand, pointed out
     to   him that this was impossible.                 So       would seem that the
                                                                 it
  _resisting medium adopted                  by
                                              the one       is  physical impossibility;
                                                                 a

                                                       is      more inadmissible.
         These two forces, real or apparent, are both repulsive; can
                                     single force? If any celestial body exer

     cise this singular action,          it  can be no other than the sun itself.
 t
‘     But can   it   be imagined that         a force emanating from the sun can
  act on any body in any other direction than that of the radius
  L vector?       Yes, certainly, the mechanician answers,                if  the body
  \moves       from    right  to  left,  and       the
                                                  if    force      not
                                                                     is instantaneously
;    propagated like that           of gravitation, but with an enormous velo
   city, indicated             bythe disproportion of the composing forces.
   iSo, then, the repulsive force exercised                      by
                                                                 the sun and endowed

 composition leads to precisely the same conclusions.           The sun
 alone exercises it: it does not depend on the sun’s mass, which
 is not operative in this case ; it is probably only caused by the
 incandeseence of the sun’s surface; for this it is that distinguishes
 the sun from the planets, the vicinity of which does not affect
 the <U+FB01>gure of the comets.                                               ,
    Such is an idea of the repulsive-force h othesis, so far
 developed; a few steps more, and its astronomical formula may
 be attained.    A repulsive force operating at all distances, but
 evidently becoming more feeble, and that rapidly as the distance
 increases; emanating from an incandescent polar surface; pro
 pagated with a velocity equal to that of radiant caloric ; in the
 ratio of the surface and not of the mass; and pressing on the
 surfaces which it repels, in place of acting through all matter
 like gravitation :—Is there such a force in Nature?
   If  such a force exists, says M. Faye, it is probably the same
repulsive force which is manifested in all material bodies under
 the names of dilatation, of expansion, of elasticity, &c.         As in
 the case of the assumed astronomical force, the physical force
 which presides over these phenomena is due to heat; like             its  it,
 action   isrepulsive,    does  not  extend  through  bodies,  decreases
 rapidly with the distance, and relates to the surface and not to
 the mass; but there           issingle difference between them: the

    M. Faye says that for nearly three years he has worked on
 this subject; and in order to remind the Academy, he rapidly
recounts the results up to the present time, viz. that his theory
 accounts for all the observed phenomena concerning the accele
 ration of cometary motions.     Hereafter account must be taken
@of the variation of volume in the nucleus      of comets, which
 doubtless will present   some    dif<U+FB01>culties. He  has also shown
 that, varied as the <U+FB01>gures of comets are (which are complicated
 by  the effects of perspective), they possess certain features in
common—features which in their unity constitute in some mea
 sure normal <U+FB01>gure, which can be separated from accidental differ
      a
 ences.   And he thinks that the coexistence of several tails may
-be simply explained-by the presence of- substanccshaving (lit;

464,     Dr. Boasc  on M. Faye’s Memoir on    the  Existence of   a
ferent speci<U+FB01>c gravities in the atmospheres of comets: the
repulsive action of the sun, operating on them after the manner
of the metallurgical washings of ores, would arrange them in
trains more or less curved in the rear of the general motion
according to the greater density of these substances. The repul
sive force exercised by the sun on substances reduced to a great
 tenuity in cometary nebulosities, also explains the most general
 and important facts concerning the curvature of their tails, of their
multiplicity, and of their form, not conical, as Arago supposed,
 but <U+FB02>at and fully displayed in the plane of their orbit, &c. The
 dif<U+FB01>culty which so long attended the study of their heads and
their atmospheres has disappeared as by enchantment.
    In conducting his experiments in veri<U+FB01>cation of the repulsive
 force, M. Faye was guided by the memorable experiment of
Cavendish on the mutual attraction between two solid bodies;
 in which the scienti<U+FB01>c world, he says, did not see so much the
indispensable confirmation of the Newtonian theory, as an inge
nious method of ascertaining the density of the earth.       In expe
 rimenting, however, on the repulsive force, the question assumes
a different aspect, as the earth no longer exercises this force in
 a sensible manner; for at the present day the sun alone pos
 sesses this property, since it alone, in our little world, has pre
 served its primeval incandescenec.      Nor can we experiment on
the solar action, because its repulsive force does not come within
our reach; it is dissipated on the superior beds of the atmo
sphere, in consequence of its incapacity of acting through all
matter after the manner of gravitation.        So we are reduced to
 study the feeble forces which can be produced by arti<U+FB01>cial means.
 In experimenting on the attraction between two bodies, the
in<U+FB02>uence of the air and of its currents is a great obstacle to suc
 cess; and the same in<U+FB02>uence is still more obstructive in the ease
 of the repulsive force, since one of the bodies employed requires
 to be in a state of incandescenee.     This is the reason why all
 the attempts have miscarried up to the present time.        He then
 refers to the arrangements which he adopted for surmounting
 these dif<U+FB01>culties, and announces a new series of experiments in
 hand, the ineandescence being produced by the voltaic current
 in a vacuum rendered more perfect by chemical action ; and he
 hopes to be able, not only to demonstrate repulsion at a distance,
but also to measure it.
    Lastly, M. Faye thus sums up the conclusions at which he
 has arrived by his labours.     The celestial world does not obey
 one force alone, attraction, but a duality of forces, attraction
 and repulsion.     The former depends solely on the mass, the
 latter on the surface and heat. The one is propagated instanta
neously, the other successively.    The one acts through all matter

              Resisting Medium and a Repuhive Force.    \> 'j  465
without suffering any diminution, the other is intercepted even
by a simple screen. Both these forces are universal; for they
occur everywhere throughout the system of Nature.
    Having at length <U+FB01>nished the sketch of M. Faye’s memoir, it
is now proposed to make a few remarks thereon: and these
remarks will principally apply to two points—an argument in
favour of the existence of a resisting medium, the tether of space,
and some objections to the proposed repulsive force.
   But before proceeding, it may not be out of place to notice that
the appearance of speculations from such an illustrious man, and
in such a distinguished publication, is another notable sign of
the times, and proves that there is a growing desire in the
scienti<U+FB01>c world to emancipate itself from that thraldom to the
accumulation of facts which in the <U+FB01>rst instance is wise, if only
the means to an end, but which, if dogmatically adhered to as
intrinsically valuable in itself, can never enlarge the <U+FB01>eld of
science. It is like the folly of the miser who accumulates money,
but never applies it to its legitimate use. Facts we must have,
they are the raw material of science ; but a good hypothesis is
of more value than a multitude of similar facts. To the same
effect M. Faye observes that his hypothesis has already proved
to be fruitful, and that it will in the hands of practical men
render much greater services; for to observe well, a good theory
is almost as necessary as a good telescope. Acting on this prin
ciple, how much Laplace has accomplished in France; and in
this country Newton has done more for science than any other
man by his theory of gravitation, which was not attained by
personal industry in accumulating facts, but by pondering on
known facts till utilized by generalization; for, as he says in
writing to the astronomer Flamsteed, “all the world knows that
I make no observations myself.”
   It would seem that the great dif<U+FB01>culty in accepting the exist
ence of a resisting medium depends on the discrepancy between
the calculated and the observed amount of the variation in the
eccentricity of Encke and.Faye’s comets: but are the data of
these calculations so perfectly reliable, that the failure in the
analysis can subvert the established opinion concerning the
nature of the tether of space? If it be ignored, what becomes of
the beautiful undulatory theory which explains the progression
of light and radiant heat? It is dif<U+FB01>cult to conceive that any
physical force, including gravitating force, can be transferred
from one part of the solar system to another without a successive
action and reaction on intermediate parts.       In times past the
actio in distuns was accepted because the phenomenon viewed
onl super<U+FB01>cially presentedlthis appearance; and to revert to

ceed from the known to the unknown.                  We know that in the

 will be put in motion             by
                               raising and letting fall the ball at the

      M. Faye’s analyses relating to the acceleration of comets, seem
 to have rested on two data concerning a resisting medium: in the

 and revolving medium.                                _
    It does not appear in this memoir why such a distinction was
 adopted; and it is not easy to imagine the grounds for such con

to gravitate towards the sun, and its layers also cease to press
 each other according to the law of density.”        This statement is
incomprehensible: atmospheres        revolve   with   their respective
 central bodies, as aether with the sun, and yet their layers press
 on each other.               If
                        the medium possess any weight, however
,inappreciable, it cannot lose this by revolving ; and if it be im

  more condensed in the vicinity of every celestial mass, and more
  particularly around the sun, which in mass transcends all the
  others. In calculating the amount of this density as progressively
  increasing towards the centre of the system, the intense heat of
  the sun need not be regarded as a modifying force; for its rays
  can in no way affect the nether, since it is perfectly diathermanous.
\
     The grand objection to the :ether as a resisting medium ade
  quate to the explanation of cometary acceleration, is the state
  ment of M. Faye, that each comet would require a distinct zone
.or ring in space, varying in density not regularly in the ratio of
  the sun’s distance, but sometimes inversely, as in the case of some
  of Saturn’s rings. Should this be established as a fact, some other
  disturbing in<U+FB02>uences must be sought for besides acther as a re
  sisting medium; but still this would not annul the existence of
acther, for it would ever remain a datum as a retarding in<U+FB02>uence
  quantum valeat.
     In such a wide <U+FB01>eld for speculation, it is not dif<U+FB01>cult to ima
  gine that such rings may exist in space as cosmical or nebular
  matter of extreme tenuity and yet really ponderous as compared
  with the aether in which they are situated.       Such matter may be
  the residue of the solar zones, from which, according to Laplace’s
theory, each planet was evolved; or, a new form assumed by
comets, which by the successive shortening of the major axis of
  their orbits, have been reduced to their mean distance from the
  sun, at which place the body is still very voluminous, and would
  be still more rare<U+FB01>ed if reduced to the state of a ring revolving
  around the sun as in the case of Saturn.
     Before concluding, a few. words may be said concerning the
 operation of a repulsive force emanating from the sun, and which
  is said to be suf<U+FB01>cient for the explanation of all the phenomena
of comets, including the acceleration of the periodical comets:
  yet in truth we know but little concerning these phenomena,
 nothing concerning their rotation, although, as revolving bodies,
  they doubtless do rotate.
     The radiant heat issuing from the incandescent surface of the
 sun is certainly the vera cause of many calori<U+FB01>c phenomena; but
 that it can accelerate directly or indirectly the motion of a comet
  does not seem probable.     A comet falling towards the sun with
 enormously increasing velocity, like the return of a rocket to the
 earth, will pari pass-u contract in volume, and consequently in
 crease in density, in consequence of the increased in<U+FB02>uence of
 gravitation: when it has gained its perihelion, like a vibrating

 gradually diminishing velocity and increasing volume until it
attains to its aphelion.    If the comet, in its a proach to the sun,

direction in any way opposite to its motion, the friction must be
tantamount to an increase of gravity, which, by reducing the
orbit, must increase the centrifugal force, thereby accelerating
its motion. This cause alone may not account for the entire
alteration; but the subject is as yet in its infancy, and cannot
be fairly condemned in the summary manner in which M. Faye
has dealt with it; He gives us, it is true, another hypothesis in
its place, but it does not seem to be in any way superior to that
of Encke. We know the effect which radiant heat has on bodies
when it impinges on them: if the surface be re<U+FB02>ecting, accord
 to its degree the rays of heat are diverted; if it be absorbing,
 the heat assumes another phase and operates as an expansive
 force ; if it be diathermanous,      it passes freely through and
 renews its course on the opposite side of the body. - In the case
 of comets, radiant heat can only be supposed to act in the two
 last-mentioned ways: in the last, in respect to a comet’s motion,
 it must be perfectly inoperative; in the second, a certain amount
 of heat would be absorbed and enlarge the volume of the comet,
 thereby pro tanto counteracting the condensing effect of the sun’s
 gravitating pressure.
      M. Faye would seem to imply that the repulsive force of the
 sun is arrested by the surface of the comet, and thus is enabled to
 forcibly act on it as by impact; and agreeably to this notion he
 asserts, what is contrary to our daily experience, that “ the repul
 sive force of the sun does not come within our reach ; that it is
 dissipated on the superior beds of the atmosphere, in consequence
 of its incapacity of acting through all matter after the manner
 of gravitation.” If it could be supposed that comets are enve
 loped by an impervious skin, as M. Valz suggested, and that'
 this, moreover, had a good re<U+FB02>ecting surface like some polished
 metals, then the impinging and re<U+FB02>ecting of an enormous mul
 titude of the sun’s re s might by their aggregate force produce
  a sensible motion.     llut of what avail are suggestions of this
 kind: hypotheses arrived at inductively from facts may be tole
  rated, though they may prove to be invalid; but it is perfectly
  illogical to assume a fact, and then make it the subject of an
  argument.
      It may be that M. Faye’s repulsive force emanating from the
  sun may    be well conceived, but imperfectly apprehended:   it may
  prove to be akin to centrifugal force, which is the correlative of
                                 ‘
  gravity, as set forth in the Philosophy of Nature.’ But then
  such a mode of repulsion is quite different from that other mode
  of repulsion, which, as radiant heat, not only emanates from
  incandescent, but also from all hot bodies, and which is trans
  mitted from body to body by the vibrations of     ethereal
                                                             atoms.   ,
      Each mode of the physical forces can only be manifested-by.

        HAD      hoped, before the appearance of the present Number of
 IV       this Magazine, to be able to prosecute the observations on’
 Lunar Radiation referred to in my letter to Sir John Herschel
 to a de<U+FB01>nite issue; but I am so closely occupied with inquiries
                              I
 of another kind, that must for the present content myself with
 recording the observations on which the remarks contained in '
 the letter referred to were founded.
  r My
             place of observation was the roof of the Royal Institution‘
 in Albcmarle Street, where I had a platform erected, suf<U+FB01>ciently
 high to enable me to sweep a large portion of the heavens with
 my thermo-electric pile, without impediment from the chimney
 pots.       \Vircs were carried from the pile to an excellent galvano
 meter plaeed in the laboratory, the <U+FB02>oor of which was about            '
 seventy-two feet below the platform.
  1 On directing the axis of the pile towards            the heavens, the
 chilling produced by radiation from its exposed face was so
 considerable-1', and the consequent galvanomctric              de<U+FB02>ection so
 great, that it was quite hopeless to operate on the needle in this
 position.         To move it a single degree would have required
 many hundred times the quantity of heat or cold necessary to
 urge it through one of the lower degrees of the galvanometric
 scale;      I  therefore operated as follows :—

 surement.       Nevertheless it would be a mere game of intellectual,
 gymnastics to continue such speculations as these; for re<U+FB02>ection
.on observations made before and since the publication of my
 letter to Sir John Herschel, leads me to conclude that in the
 atmosphere of London it is perfectly hopeless to obtain trust
 worthy results on this very delicate question.
    For example, my place of observation was Albemarle Street,
 and my pile when turned on the moon looked nearly ‘due south.
 The re<U+FB02>ector of the instrument thus cleared in a great measure
 the buildings of Lambeth.         I  tin-ned the instrument eastward,
 through a large are, but in so doing came more over the mass of
 London.        This may account for the diminished loss of heat.
 But even this, though apparently a natural one enough,            I  should
 hesitate to assign as the real cause of the result observed.          Fresh
 experiments, under different conditions, will be required to de
 cide the question.
    I  ma add that     I have furnished the pile with a conical re<U+FB02>ector
 of polished tin of vast dimensions, hoping thereby to collect, not
 only the moon’s luminous rays, but also her obscure rays, which
 even if they reached the earth, were c<U+FB01>'ectually cut off by the
 polyzonal lens which Melloni used in his experiments on the
 moon. To protect the exp05cd face of the pile from currents
           I
 of air, have had the re<U+FB02>ector furnished with screens of rock-salt.
 But these precautions led to no satisfactory result, the irregu
 larities of the London atmosphere producing disturbances of the
 galvanometcr far more than suf<U+FB01>cient to mask the effect of the
 moon’s rays.

     N throwing the spectrum of lithium upon         the screen yesterdayI
       I was surprised to see a magni<U+FB01>cent blue band. At <U+FB01>rst I thought
 the chloride of lithium must be adulterated with strontium; but
                                                                           on
 testing it with Steinheil's apparatus, it yielded normal results with
 out any trace of a blue band.      I am just now reading the report of
 your Discourse in the ‘Chemical News,’ and I <U+FB01>nd that you hate
 noticed the same thing.      \Vhence does this blue line arise? Does it
 really belong to the lithium, or are the coke-points or ignited air
 guilty of its production? I<U+FB01>nd three blue bands with chloride of
 sodium, but they haVe not the de<U+FB01>niteness and
                                                   brilliancy of the lithium
 band. When lithium wire burns in air, it emits a splendid crimson
light; plunge it into oxygen, and the light changes to bluish white.

   P.S. I have just made some further experiments on the lithium
spectrum, and they conclusively prove that the appearance of the
blue line entirely depends upon temperature.           The spectrum of
chloride of lithium ignited in a Bunsen's-burner <U+FB02>ame does not dis~
close the faintest trace of the blue line : replace the Bunsen's burner
by a jet of hydrogen (the temperature of which is higher than that
of the Bunsen's burner), and the blue line appears, faint, it is true,
but sharp and quite unmistakeable; if oxygen be now slowly turned
into the jet, the brilliancy of the blue line increases until the tempe
rature of the flame rises high enough to fuse the platinum and thus
put an end to the experiment.-—E. F.

    [On the occasion referred to by Dr. Frankland, it was a general
impression among the chemists present at the lecture that I had used
the word lithium for strontium throughout the evening. This induced
me to ask Dr. Miller to test my chloride of lithium, which he found
quite pure.      I afterwards showed the blue band, the splendour of
which    is unrivalled, to my class at the School of Mines.     The coal
points    without   the  lithium  show  nothing of  the  kind;  with the
lithium the band always appears.         Either therefore the substance
itself is so altered by the exalted temperature that new periods of
oscillation are possible to      or the medium in which

draw attention to the experiment by which the absorption of the
yellow band by the sodium <U+FB02>ame was effected on the same occasion,

tomic bases, containing phosphorus and arsenic, which are formed'by'
the action of monarsincs on tln‘ brometh lated bromide, so frequently
mentioned in my researches on the phosphorus-bases.            The idea
naturally suggested itself to examine the deportment of this salt
under the in<U+FB02>uence of monostibines, with the view of producing the
phospho-stibonium-compounds.        The two bodies react upon one an
other, but only after protracted digestion or exposure to rather high
temperatures. The product of the reaction is complex, yielding a
comparatively small quantity of a ditticultly soluble platinum-salt of
 diatomic appearance.     I have repeatedly modi<U+FB01>ed the circumstances
and analysed the products in the form of platinum-salts;       I omit to
quote the detail of these experiments, since they have failed to dis
entangle the dif<U+FB01>culties of the reaction.
    Some experiments upon the deportment 0f dibromidc of ethylene
with triethylarsine were more successful.   The reaction between these
two bodies had been selected as a subject of inquiry by Mr. W.
Valentin, to whom      I am indebted for valuable assistance       at the
earlier stage of these researches.   Circumstances    have  subse ucntly
prevented Mr. Valentin from carrying out his plan, and               have

sealed tubes at a temperature not exceeding 50° C.      Notwithstanding
the low temperature, the tubes invariabl contained compressed gases ;
the product of the reaction was treated with water, which extracted
a soluble bromide from the ethylene-compound unacted upon. On eva
poration, a beautiful bromide was left, which being copiously soluble
in boiling, and sparingly soluble in cold alcohol, could be readily re
crystallized from absolute, and even from common alcohol. In water
this substance is excessively soluble, and therefore scarcely crystal
lizable from an     ueous solution.
   Analysis, as might have been expected, proved this salt to be the
analogue of the bromethylated triethylphosphonium-salt.       It contains
             C, H“, As Br,= [(C2 H, Br) (0, H,), As] Br*.
   The bromide of bromethyl-trieth larsonium, the composition of
which is suf<U+FB01>ciently established by t e analysis of the corresponding

determined by Quintino Sella; it corresponds exactly with that of
the corresponding phosphorus-compound.

     “ On the Lunar-diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination ob
 tained from the Kew Photograms* in the years 1858, 1859, and
 1860." ByMajor-General Edward Sabine, R.A., Treas andV.P.R.S.1‘
     Having communicated to the R0 111 Society in a recent paper an
 analysis of the disturbances of the declination in the years 1858 and
 1859, shown by the photograms of the Kew Observatory, I propose
in the present pa er to submit the results of the lunar-diurnal
variation of the eclination in the years 1858, 1859, and 1860,
obtained from the same source.             The directions of the declination
magnet at       the  instant   of the    commencement      of every solar-hour
having     been   tabulated   from  the   photograms,    and  the <U+FB01>nal normals
for each month and hour computed, after the omission from the
record of all the hourly directions which deviated 3"3 from their
<U+FB01>nal normals,--the di<U+FB02>'erences were taken between each of the re
maining hourly directions and the <U+FB01>nal normal of the same month
and hour, and were entered afresh in lunar monthly tables, having
the lunar days in successive horizontal lines, and the twenty-four
lunar hours in vertical columns, each difference being placed under
the lunar hour to which it most nearly approximated.                  The entries
in these tables should consequently represent directly the lunar in
<U+FB02>uence at the different lunar hours, subject only to minor disturb
    * The term Photogram is adopted in place of Photograph in conformity with
modern usage.
    1‘ [Note added on February 8th, 1861.]   When this communication was read to
the Royal Society on January 10th, 1861, it contained the lunar-diurnal variation
for the years 1858 and 1859 only: whilst it was passing through the press, the
calculation of the lunar-diurnal variation for 1860 was completed, and the results
in that year have been added.

480                          Royal Society   :—
ances; the effects of the solar-diurnal variation as well as of the
larger disturbances having been eliminated.          The differences were
marked with a + sign when the north end of the magnet was cast
of its mean direction, and with the — sign when west of the same.
The differences were then summed u , and hourly, monthly, and
annual means taken by the non-commissioned of<U+FB01>cers of the Royal
Artillery employed at Woolwich, under the superintendence of
Mr. Magrath.
    Having in the former paper exhibited the results of the disturb
ances at   ch    in comparison with those at Hobarton, I propose to
do the same' with the lunar-diurnal variation treated of in this com
munication; believing that such                      are very conducive to
a just                of the systematic comparisons
                                          c iaructer and natural reality of
the resuappreciation
           ts, and instructive both by the agreements and disagree
ments which they exhibit. The lunar-diurnal variation at Hobarton
 has been obtained for the purpose of this comparison, by a similar
 process to that which has been described above, from observations at
 every solar hour during five years (Sundays excepted), from Oct. II
 1843 to Sept. 30, 1848; omitting as disturbed such observations as
 deviated 2" 13 from their respective <U+FB01>nal normals. The total number
 of hourly observations was 36,832 ; the disturbed observations 2606 ;
 and the number employed in the lunar-diurnal variation 34,226. As
 it has been customary to represent such periodical variations by
 formula: of well-known character, the results at Kew and Hobarton
 are here represented by formula) in which a, corresponding to a: (the
 lunar time for which the lunar-diurnal variation is desired), is counted
 in hours and parts of an hour, multiplied by l5°, from the epoch of
 the moon’s upper culmination.         The + sign corresponds (as before)
 to a de<U+FB02>ection of the north end of the magnet to the east of its mean
                  -—
 place, and the      sign to the west.

 Ilobarton A1= —0"'l+1”'14 sin (a+ 344°'7) + 6"‘Ssin(2a+43°'2).
     In computing the lunar-diurnal variation by        means of' these for
  mulae, the coef<U+FB01>cient   of the term which includes the sine of twice the
  hour-angle is of   principal importance: the subsequent terms           m
  comparatively of   little signi<U+FB01>cance, and are therefore omitted on the
  present occasion.     When all the terms are employed, the original
  observed values are reproduced.

  as actually observed on the mean of the three years, and in column 3,
  the same computed by the formula.           lolumn 4 is the lunar-diurnal

    The      aspect of the lunar-diurnal variation at Kew and Hobarton
presents        features of great simplicity as well as accord.           The form at
both stations is a division of the 24 lunar hours into four equal or
nearly equal portions, in which the magnet is attracted alternately to
the east and to the west of its mean position, which is passed through
four times in the progress of the magnet towards two extreme east
erly and two extreme westerly de<U+FB02>ections: the easterly extremes
are about 12 hours apart, and the westerly the same.                     As far as our
present experience goes, this appears to be the general form of the
 lunar-diurnal variation of the declination at all the stations at which
it has been examined; it is also that of the corres ending variations
 of the Dip and Total force. At Hobarton, where t e results are ob
 tained from <U+FB01>ve years of observation, there is scarcely any difference
 deserving of notice between the amplitudes of the extremes on either
 side of the upper culmination and those on either side of the lower
culmination.             At Kew, where the results are obtained from only
 three years, the extremes de<U+FB02>ections are not quite so symmetrical
 in amount, but they may become more so as additional years are
 brought into the account. The amplitude of the oscillation on a mean
 of the two alternations is 9' ' ‘74 at Kew and 6"‘8 at Hobarton, a differ
 ence in correspondence with the difference in the opposite direction of
  the antagonistic retaining force of the earth’s magnetism at the two
  stations, which is 3'7 at Kew and 4-5 at Hobarton.                    On inspecting

 482     -                    Royal Society    :—
 the Table, we see that the lunar times when the moon’s in<U+FB02>uence pro
 duces   no de<U+FB02>ection (or the times when the variation is zero), are
 four, and arenearly the sameat Kew and at Hobarton, two of them being
 a little more than an hour before the moon’s passage of the meridian,
 both at her up er and lower culminations, and the other two inter
 mediate.    So ar the two stations are alike; but in regard to the
 direction towards which the magnet is de<U+FB02>ected (if in conformity
 with general usage we speak in both hemispheres of the north end
 of the magnet, as is done in the Table), we see that the variation
 becomes west at Kew when it becomes east at Hobarton, and vice verari;
 the phases, while agreeingiu hours at the two stations, having througln       '
out opposite signs.
  By extending the comparison of the lunar hours            at which the lunar
 variation passes through its zero-points to other stations than Kew
 and Hobarton, we are made aware of differences which appear to
  deserve particular attention in theoretical respects.          At Pekin, for
 example—which may           be  advantageously compared      with   Kew, being
 both in the same hemisphere, but Pekin some degrees nearer the
  equator—the variation is zero in the passage of the north end of the
 magnet from east to west at 20% lunar hours, or         2%-hours earlier than
 the corresponding epoch at Kew.              Again, at the Cape of Good
 Hope, situated in the same hemisphere with Hobarton, but some
 degrees nearer the equator, the variation      is  zero in the passage of the
 north end of the magnet from west to east also at 20% lunar hours,
 or 25  hours earlier than the corresponding epoch at Hoharton.             Thus
 there   isan accord of precisely the same kind between Pekin and the
 Cape of Good Hope that there       is   between Kew and Hobarton, whilst
 there
         is
         a   difference between the two pairs of stations of          2%hours in
 the position of the moon relatively to the meridian at which she
 ceases to exercise a    de<U+FB02>ecting in<U+FB02>uence on the magnet.            Again, at
 St. Helena, which    is  in the same (geographical) hemisphere as Ho
barton and the Cape of Good Hope, but still nearer to the equator
than either, the lunar in<U+FB02>uence      is   zero in the passage from west to
east at 19% lunar hours, being one hour earlier than at the Cape,
and    3%hours earlier than at Hobarton.
    Where the whole range of the variation of which we have been
treating      so small (not more than
              is                          a  few seconds of arc  in   each lunar
day),  it may   be desirable  to  show by the  accordance  of the  independent
evidence obtained in single years, the degree of con<U+FB01>dence which may
be placed in the mean results of several years.          This may be seen in
the Table on the next page, which contains the se arate results in
each of the <U+FB01>ve successive years of observation at            obarton, as well
as their mean.
    In this Table the principal features of the variation are seen to be
substantially alike in each year. The individual results at the several
hours in single years are of course somewhat less regular than in the
mean of the <U+FB01>ve years: such small discrepancies are no doubt in great
part due to the lesser disturbances which, being below the separating
value of 2"13, have been left in the body of the observations.             They
slightly dis<U+FB01>gure the symmetry of the results in single years, but
almost entirely disappear when the mean of several years         is  taken. In

order to appreciate justly and fully the con<U+FB01>dence to which the whole
 investigation is entitled, it must be borne in mind that every single
 entry in the Table (exclusive of course of the column which exhibits
the mean of the <U+FB01>ve preceding columns) is derived from a wholly
 independent bod of observations which belong to itself alone, and
 are not employs in the deduction of any of the other entries.

   It may operate as an encouragement to those who have not yet
subjected their observations to any process of examination or analysis,
to perceive, by this example, 110w substantially satisfactory are the
results which ma be obtained from even a single year of hourly ob
servations, after       the
                      larger disturbances and the solar-diurnal variation

the entries at solar hours are rewritten according to the lunar hours

original order and relations are changed and are replaced by others
which were wholly unforeseen, so that the observations mustnecessarily
be free from the possibility of having been in<U+FB02>uenced by any mental
bias. When we <U+FB01>nd the eticcts of         natural law, represented

observations of a single year with the degree of symmetry shown in
Table II., we may safely conclude that the observations themselves
are worthy of the labour bestowed in eliciting their results.              In this
view the Hobarton observations prove themselves to have been not
only a faithful, but also an extremely careful series, highly creditable
to Captain Kay, R.N., and to the Naval Of<U+FB01>cers who with him and
their Civil Assistant Mr. Jeffery, maintained for so many years the
laborious and monotonous duty of hourly observation.

   In conclusion, it may be useful to call the attention of the Societv,
and of those Fellows in particular who interest themselves in tracing
u the phenomena of nature to their physical causes, to the assem
h age of facts which are now available for such inquiries, in a branch
of magnetieal science which may not inappropriatelv be called
celestial magnetism.         In the introductory discussion pre<U+FB01>xed to the
2nd volume of the St. Helena Magnetical Observations, p. cxliv to
cxlviii, the lunar-diurnal variation is given for each of the three
magnetic elements, the Declination, the Dip, and the Intensity of the
force, at the four stations of Toronto, St. Helena, the Cape of Good
Hope and Hobarton, and for the Declination at two additional stations
Kew and Pekin. The variations are given both in formula: and in

     Mr. G.    Gore on the Properties    of Liquid Carbonic Acid.      485
tables; the latter exhibiting the amount of the lunar in<U+FB02>uence at
each of the 24 lunar hours, in the several magnetic elements at each
station.      These data are directly applicable to in uiries into the
nature of the moon’s magnetism; and into the mo e by which the
moon’s magnetism acts either on the magnetism of the earth itself,
or on the magnetic needle stationed at different points of the earth’s
 surface, so as to produce a small but systematic and perfectly ap
 preciable variation in each of the magnetic elements, having a double
 period in every lunar day.
     The lunar-diurnal variation' of the Declination at Kew and Ho
 barton, as given in this communication, is slightly different from the
 <U+FB01>gures in the 2nd St. Helena volume referred to, because the results at
 Kew are a mean of 3 years instead of 2, as in the St. Helena volume;
 and at Hobarton a lower standard has been taken for the disturb
 ances, causing a larger number of the disturbed observations to be
 omitted in the calculation of the lunar-diurnal variation.

     The following communications were read :—
      “ On the Calculus of Symbols, with Applications to the Theory of
 Differential Equations.”       By W. H. A. Russell, A.B.
      “On the Properties of Liquid Carbonic Acid.” By G. Gore, Esq.
      In this communication the author     has shown how a small quantity
 of liquid carbonic acid may be readily and safely prepared in glass
 tubes closed by stoppers of gutta percha, and be brought in a pure
 state into contact with any solid substance upon which it may be de
 sired to ascertain its chemical or solvent action, or be submitted to the
  action of electricity by means of wires introduced through the stoppers.
  . By immersing about <U+FB01>fty substances in the liquid acid for various
  periods of time, he has found that it is comparatively a chemically
  inert substance, and not deoxidized by any ordinary deoxidizing
  agent except the alkali-metals.        Its solvent power is extremely
  limited; it dissolves camphor freely, iodine sparingly, and a few
  other bodies in small quantities; it does not dissolve oxygen-salts,
  and it does not rcdden solid extract of litmus; it penetrates gutta
  percha, dissolves out the dark~brown colouring matter, and leaves
  the gutta percha nndissolved, and much more white.         It also acts in
  a singular and somewhat similar manner upon india-rubber;              the
   indie-rubber whilst in the liquid acid exhibits no change, but imme
   diately on being taken out it swells toat least six or eight times its
   original dimensions, and then slowly contracts to its original volume,
   evidently from expansion and liberation of absorbed carbonic acid;
   and it is found to be perfectly white throughout its substance. These
   effects upon gutta percha and indie-rubber may prove useful for
   practical purposes.
       The liquid acid is a strong insulator of electricity; s arks (from
   a Ruhmkorff's coil) which would pass readily throng             {Ends of
   an inch of cold air, would with difficulty pass through about
   foth of an inch of the liquid acid.                                _
       In its general properties it is somewhat analogous to bisulphide of
   carbon, but it possesses much less solvent power over fatty substances.

         Ganrnausn,               Oxford and Cambridge Club, Nov. 19, 1861.
   IN your November Number there is an account by Professor
  Tyndall of some observations with a thermo-electric pile, in the
  course of which it appeared that it
                                           “ lost more heat when presented
  to the moon than when turned to any other            ortion of the heavens
                          ”
 of the same altitude;        and there is a theoretical explanation of this
  fact as an indirect effect of the moon's heat, dispersing the “ small
                                      ”
 quantity of precipitated vapour which it appears was then <U+FB02>oating
  in the atmosphere, and so facilitating radiation from the instrument.
     Unless my memory is deceived, Sir John Herschel, in one of the
 earlier editions of his ‘Astronomy,’ described light clouds as, in like
 manner, dispersing as they came between his telescope and the moon ;
 but in the edition of 1858, here at hand, I see the phrase is " the ten
 dency to disappearance of clouds under thefull moon,” which may mean
 a very different thing, viz. a tendency to clear skies when the moon isfull.
   ~ That the heat of the full moon may tend to clear the upper atmo
 sphere, and so be the cause of cold below, may be true; but it does
 not appear to me that this can be the explanation of Professor Tyn
 dall's fact, or of Sir J. Herschel's, if l state it correctly.
     High in the air, in the region in which the moon is seen, there is
 cloud or vapour observed.        The moon may have diminished, but it
 has not destroyed it generally.        How then is that particular portion
 which happens to intervene between the observer’s instrument and
the moon more under her in<U+FB02>uence than any other equal portion?
 If a hundred observers were gazing at her at the same time within
a few miles of each other, a hundred different portions of the haze
would so intervene; and to suppose each of these dispersed, is to
suppose the haze not to exist.
     It is possible that a full examination of all the circumstances of
Professor Tyndall's six experiments-the area embraced by his
re<U+FB02>ector, the probable height of the vapour in the air, the extent of
the sweep he teok with the instrument, &c.—might remove some of
                                   __
the di<U+FB01>icultyl feel in admitting the explanation he proposes; and in
the interest of exact science I venture to call his attention to the
matter.                                                       D. D. Hana.
     ON THE    bIHEXAHEDRAL CRYSTALS 0F SULPHATE               01' YOTASII
 ‘                    BY KARL RITTER VON HAUEB*.
 I The supposed      dimorphism of the sulphate of potash, as K. Von
Hauer has proved, rests only on external appearance, as in reality
this salt in a state of chemical purity constantly affects formsof the
prismatic system, and when appearing in forms of the rhombohedral
system invariably centains a certain quantity of anhydrous sulphate
of soda. This bibasic salt is known to be produced at Glasgow, in
the shape of hexagonal plate-like crystals, by the evaporation of a
solution of kelp-ash. A mixture of both these sulphates (potash and
soda), inspissated and left to crystallize, invariabl gives no longer
hexagonal plates, but exclusively dihexahedrons ((iimblc hexagonal   ‘
                      3 Translated by Count Mmchalh

pyramids), a form scarcely if ever met with among the crystals pro
duced by the above-described technical process.         Analogous local
actions are observed on natural minerals; so that in some cases an
expert mineralogist may infer the place of origin of a mineral sub
stance from its crystalline form only.     On the other hand, conclu
sions as to the mode of formation of minerals founded on the results
of laboratory experiments must be drawn with a certain degree of
caution.    In fact, the chemical forces, when acting on large quan
tities of substances,     as in manufacturing     processes,   frequently
produce results very different from those obtained by the chemist
operating with comparatively small portions; and, still more, the
results of natural operations, gigantic in quantity as in energy,
and extending through immeasurable periods of time, may scarcely
be comparable to' mere laboratory investigations made with limited
quantities in some few hours or days.
    When immersed in solutions of other salts, the crystals of the
bibasic sulphate in question show some curious phenomena.            In a
solution of sulphate of ammonia a hexagonal plate was gradually
converted, by superposition on both of its larger planes, into a
lengthened hexagonal prism, easily cleavable at any point in a direc
tion perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. Thin plates of it taken
from the newly added portion show the characteristic optical pro
perties of the common prismatic sulphate of ammonia.       This instance
of episomorphism between 'a rhombohedral and a prismatic salt, or,
in other words, of two substances belonging each to a different cry
stallographical system and nevertheless subject to the crystallogra
phical laws of isomorphism, is highly interesting.         The angular
values of both (the rhombohedral and the prismatic combination)
being, in this special case, very near each other, the existence of the
fact here alluded to was to be decided by optical investigation.
'l‘ri<U+FB02>ing as the difference of the forms here in question may be, its
existence is a fact not to be denied; and therefore such a formation
as just described could not take place if the disposition of the mole
 cules, by whose regular aggregation such crystals are formed, did
not go on with mathematical exactitude.       Observation shows devia
tions from the strict regularity of lines and angles to be of no rare
 occurrence in crystallogenetic processes; precise measurements'of
 substances considered to be isomorphous have shown them not to be
 absolutely congruent; so that isomorphism, as far as it is concerned
 in this character, has only an approximate value. Two substances
 different in angular value, even when combined into one and the
 same crystal. cannot be considered as having totally lost their re
 spective individuality.     Their last constituent parts, representing
 the crystalline molecules of both salts (sulphates of potash and am
 monia), are in juxtaposition to each other, as if they were but one
 homogeneous substance.         Their superposition without preceding
 mixture is a proof that molecules of not absolute identity may be
 deposited on each other in the same way as analogous particles
 would be. Both these sulphates could be considered as absolutely iso
 morphousin the crystallographical sense, but for the optical phenomena
 characteristic of two distinct and mutually independent systems. Iso—
  morphism; however, presupposes chemical analogy; now the potash~

being very prevalent in quantity in the rhombohedral bibasic salt, its
chemical analogy with ammonia may be supposed to have been su—
perseded by the comparatively small proportion of soda combined
with it. In the absence of isomorphism in the strictest sense, there are
circumstances coming so near to it that the molecules of both sub
stances still attract each other suf<U+FB01>ciently to e<U+FB02>'cct regular superpo
sition.    The curved and dis<U+FB01>gured planes of such crystals are at all
eVents indicative of their origin under abnormal and, as it were, com
pulsory circumstances—Proceedings oft/re Vienna Imperial Institute,

  COMPARISON or THE TEMPERATURE IN THE AIR AND 01* THE
         son. AT A DEPTH or TWO METRES.          BY M. POURIAU.
    From observations made during <U+FB01>ve consecutive years on the tem
perature of the soil at a depth of 2 metres compared with that of the
air, it follows-—
    1. That the mean temperature in the air was 10°'2l, and in the
soil 12°'79. Difference in favour of the soil 2'58.
    '2. That the mean temperature of the soil in winter and autumn is
higher than that of the air; that in summer it is about 2 degrees
lower, and that in spring the mean temperatures are virtually equal.
    3. That the mean of the extreme maximum temperatures in the
air was 34°25, in the soil it was 19°‘75. On the other hand, the
 mean of the extreme minima in air was -12°'14; in the soil this
mean never sank below + 6°.
    4. While in air the mean of the total di<U+FB01>'erences between the
extreme maxima and extreme minima reached 46°'64, in the soil
this mean was only 13°'74.
    5. In 1860 the temperature of the air sank to —20°, in the soil
the minimum was never less than +5°'47.
    6. While in the air the maximum temperature usually occurs in
July or August, and the minimum in December or January, the
maximum temperature in the soil always corresponds to the end of
 August; the minimum always occurs at the end of February, or on
the <U+FB01>rst days of March.
    7. The changes of temperature in the soil at a depth of 2 metres
 may be thus stated :—
    While the mean temperature of the air usually begins to sink
towards the end of July, in the soil the heat continues to accumulate
in the superior layers under the in<U+FB02>uence of the intense solar radia
tion, and to extend to the lower layers, until the end of August.
From this point the upper layers begin to lose more heat by radia
tion than they receive; the <U+FB02>ow of heat changes its direction, it
passes from the lower to the upper layers and becomes lost in the
air; and this ascending motion, continuing until February, is more
rapid as the external temperature is lower, that is, as the winter is
longer and more severe.       Towards the middle of February or the
beginning of March the upper layers begin to become heated under
the in<U+FB02>uence of the solar rays, whose direction has become less
oblique; the inferior layers give less and less heat to the upper
ones; they begin, on the contrary, to receive some, and become
then reheated, which continues until the end of August.—Comples

LXIII.    Static and Dynamic Stability in the Secondary Systems.
                     By DANIEL VAUGHAN, Esq.*
        small are the prima     planets compared with their distances
 SO    from the sun, that {hey are regarded as material points in
the investigations of physical astronomy, and that no e<U+FB01>'ects
arising from the unequal intensity; of solar attraction on their
parts can vitiate in any sensible degree the results which analysis
gives for their movements.        But in the systems of Jupiter and
Saturn many satellites are exposed to an enormous tidal force in
consequence of their proximity to their primaries ; and the planet
ary theory requires some modi<U+FB01>cation when applied to the revolu
tions of these minor worlds.         My chief object at present is to
show that the unequal attraction of a primary occasions slow
secular changes in the orbits of its attendants, especially when
the presence of <U+FB02>uids on their surfaces brings tidal commotions
                    I
into play. But deem it <U+FB01>rst necessary to prove what              I have
assumed in my former communications, in regard to the physical
necessity for a synchronism of the orbital and rotatory motions
of these bodies, and for the small inclination of their equator-s
to the planes of their orbits.
   On previous occasions      I endeavoured to show that such an
arrangement would be the ultimate consequence of excessive
tides, when a satellite contained large bodies of <U+FB02>uid, or when,
from its close proximity to the primary, the solid matter of which
it may be composed were not possessed of su<U+FB02>icient cohesive
force to withstand the effects of the great disturbance.        But the
same result would ultimately arise from slow secular changes
which must occur in eve           possible case.    Let us suppose, for
instance, that the <U+FB01>rst sateiiite of Jupiter were composed entirely
of solid materials suf<U+FB01>ciently strong to resist all crushing strains
to which they may be exposed, and that its form, in the absence
of all disturbing forces, were an exact sphere. Such a bod ,

a time different from   that of its revolution, would have its equa
torial gravity subject to a variation of about 1% per cent. ;
and the central pressure along the plane of the equator would
undergo a periodical change of about 3000 pounds to the square
inch. Now in consequence of the compressibility which belongs
to every kind of solid matter, the satellite would be continually
changed to an ellipsoid, the longest diameter always forming the
same angle with the direction of the primary.           If its component
parts  had  a modulus    of  elasticity  as great as that  of iron, a dif
ference of one-<U+FB01>fth of a mile may be expected         between   the major
 and mean axis; but were the mass of a more yielding character,
 or were it covered with <U+FB02>uid, its ever-changing form would de
 viate more considerably from a true sphere.
    The effect which the attraction of the primary would exert Oil
 the rotation of an ellipsoidal satellite, the major axis of which
 had a constant inclination to the radius vector of its orbit, may
 be found by a method similar to that pursued for determining
 theoretically the amount of the precession of the equinoxes. Let
 A, B, and C be the major, mean, and minor semiaxes of the

without any loss of force.
   Although the in<U+FB02>uence of distant bodies in changing the plane
of the orbit may prevent        I from sinking to zero, yet we must
recognize the tendency to the peculiar arrangement which reduces
to the lowest scale the dynamic effects of the disturbing force on
their surfaces of secondary planets.       But though their times of
rotation and the position of their axes may be adjusted for attain
ing this object, the eccentricity of the orbit would bring tidal
action into existence; and any commotions which this might
occasion in their seas must be attended with secular changes in
the size and form of their orbits.           This will appear evident
when we consider that these tides could not reach their higheat
level on the parts of the satellite in conjunction with the primary,
until some time after the disturbing force which produced them
attained its greatest intensity; and the subordinate world would
thus present a greater deviation from a true sphere, in passing
from the lower to the higher apsis, than in returning to the
former point.      It would accordingly feel the restraint of the
centripetal force more intensely when retiring from the primary
than when approaching him ; and its motion would be retarded
during the former period to an extent slightly greater than
that to which it is accelerated during the latter.              We may
therefore reasonably expect a secular alteration in its mean
motion and the size of its orbit; but it may be advisable to
show by analytical investigations, that such changes take place
on a scale corresponding to the waste of tidal power.
   Although this may be done without any hypothesis in regard

of such compounds probable.        The hydrated oxide, which      pre                      is
pared in  a  similar manner to the corresponding rubidium com

     This salt contains no water of crystallization, it does not un
 dergo alteration in the air, and may be obtained from its aqueous
 solution in the form of small shining crystals of a prismatic form,
 in which the faces of the prism are generally better de<U+FB01>ned than
 those at the summits.          The crystals obtained by slow evapora
 tion at 14° C. belong to the hexagonal system, and are isomor
 phous with nitrate of rubidium.               The primary form is an obtuse
 hexagonal dodccahedron, with polar angles of 142° 56', and basal
 angles of 78° 58', corresponding to the following relation of the
 axes

    If the  primary form       be taken to be a hexagonal              dodccahedron
of the second order, the corresponding hexagonal dodccahedron
of the <U+FB01>rst order yields as a hemihedral form a rhombohcdron
having polar angles of 106° 40'. Through this form, therefore,
the isomorphism of the nitrates of caesium and rubidium, and the
potash and soda nitre, becomes apparent.                      We have-—

When crystallized quickly, the salt separates out in long needle
shapcd prisms, longitudinally striated.                     It has the same saline
bitter cooling taste as saltpetre—so much so that these salts can
not thus be distinguishcd from each other.                         On heating, the
salt melts to a thin liquid at temperatures almost below the red
heat; and when more strongly heated it evolves oxygen, and is
converted <U+FB01>rst into nitrite, and afterwards, by absorption of
moisture from the air, into caustic hydrate of caesium, which
      ' This angle served   as basis   of calculation for the primary form.

   Carbonate of caesium is gradually heated with an excess of
sulphuric acid until the temperature rises nearly to redness. The
salt then consists of a transparent colourless liquid, which, on
cooling, solidi<U+FB01>es to a crystalline mass. Dissolved in water, the
acid salt thus obtained crystallizes upon slow evaporation in the
form of small short rhombic prisms, having rectangular termina
tions, and having the acute longitudinal edges equally bevelled.
The crystals belong to the rhombic system.      The relation of the
horizontal axes is nearly
                                     a   :       b: 1   :   1'38.
The crystals obtained were badly formed, and their surfaces were
not polished enough to enable us to make any accurate measure
ments with the re<U+FB02>ecting goniometer.       The relation of the prin
cipal axis to the horizontal axes could also not be obtained, as no
faces were visible on the terminal edges of the prism. The cry

   The aqueous solution of this salt possesses an insipid taste,
but a bitter after-taste. It is far more soluble in water than the
corresponding potassium-salt.          100 parts of water take up at
 -—2° C. not less than 1587 parts of sulphate of caesium, whereas
only 80 parts of sulphate of potassium are dissolved under similar
circumstances.        When the aqueous solution is allowed to evapo
rate slowly over sulphuric acid, small, irregularly formed, hard
crystals are deposited, which generally are found to have the form
of short <U+FB02>attened prisms, and often occur grouped together in
irregular masses. The crystals are anhydrous, quite unaffected
by exposure to air, and insoluble in alcohol. Wehave not sue
ceeded in obtaining any individual crystals suitable for mea
surement.
   The analysis of the salt was made by converting the carbonate
into the sulphate.        For this purpose 0'7921 grm. of fused car
bonate of caesium was treated with sulphuric acid, and yielded
0'8828 grm. of fused sulphate.          Hence the composition of the

potassium, as a mass of feathery crystals.           Chloride of caesium
fuses at a low red heat, and volatilizes at a higher temperature
much more easily than chloride of potassium, in the form of white

   As almost all the platinum which found in commerce          very        is                                   is
impure, and often possesses an atomic weight from to per cent.                                     6    8
below the true value, we have previously puri<U+FB01>ed the platinum
which we used for the preparation of these as well as of the rubi
dium salts. This puri<U+FB01>cation was effected       fusing the chloride                       by
of platinum and potassium in platinum dish with mixture of       a                                     a
the carbonates of potassium and sodium, washing out the mass
with water, and dissolving the residue in dilute aqua regia. When
this operation had been repeated <U+FB01>ve times,      was found that the                       it
platinum attained an atomic weight varying but very slightly
from 991.
    The analysis of the double chloride was carried out as fol
lows :—The salt was weighed out in U-shaped tube of hard                        a

 at  atemperature  of 160° to 170° C., and the tube, with the sub

     V. Reactions of the Rubidium and     Cresium   Compounds.
                                                                  ’1
    Cmsium and rubidium are not precipitated either by sul hu
retted hydrogen or by carbonate of ammonium.            Hence both
metals must be placed in the group containing magnesium,
lithium, potassium, and sodium.        They are distinguished from
magnesium, lithium,     and sodium    by their reaction with bichlo
ride of platinum, which precipitates them like potassium. Neither
rubidium nor caesium can be distinguished from potassium by
any of the usual reagents.    All three substances are precipitated
by tartaric acid as white crystalline powders; by hydro<U+FB02>uosilicic
acid as transparent opaleseent jellies, and by perchloric acid as
granular crystals; all three, when not combined with a <U+FB01>xed
acid, are easily volatilized on the platinum wire, and they all
three tinge the <U+FB02>ame violet.     The violet colour appears indeed
of a blucr tint in the case of potassium, whilst the <U+FB02>ame of rubi
dium is of a redder shade, and that of caesium still more red.
These slight di<U+FB02>erences’can, however, only be perceived when
the three <U+FB02>ames are observed side by side, and when the salts
undergoing volatilization are perfectly pure.    In their reactions,
then, with the common chemical tests, these new elements can
not be distinguished from potassium.        The only method by
means of which they can be recognized when they occur together
is that of spectrum-analysis.
   The spectra of rubidium and caesium are highly characteristic,
and are remarkable for their great beauty.      In examining and
measuring these spectra we have employed an improved form of
apparatus, which in every respect is much to be preferred to
that described in our <U+FB01>rst memoir.     In addition to the advan
tages of being more manageable and producing more distinct
and clearer images, it is so arranged that the spectra of two
sources of light can be examined at the same time, and thus,
with the greatest degree of precision, compared, both with one
another and with the numbers on a divided scale.
   The apparatus is represented by <U+FB01>g. 12, Plate VI.        On the
 upper  end  of  the cast-iron foot F  a  brass   plate is screwed,
carrying the <U+FB02>int-glass prism P, having a refracting angle of 60°.
 The tubeA is also fastened to the brass plate; in the end of this
tube, nearest the prism, is placed a lens, whilst the other end is
closed by a plate in which a vertical slit has been made.       Two
arms are also <U+FB01>tted on to the cast-iron foot, so that they are
moveable in a horizontal plane about the axis of the foot.      One
of these arms carries the telescope B, having a magnifying
power of 8, whilst the other carries the tube C ; a lens is
placed in this tube at the end nearest to the prism, and at the
other end is a scale which can be seen through the telescope      by,

re<U+FB02>exion   from   the front surface of the prism.         This scale is a
photographic copy       of  a millimetre-scale,   which    has been pro
duced in the camera, of about T1; the original dimensions*. The
scale is covered with tinfoil so that only the narrow strip upon
which the divisions and the numbers are engraved can be seen.
    The upper half only of the slit is left free, as is seen by refer
ence to <U+FB01>g. 11, Plate VI.; the lower half is covered by a small
equilateral glass prism, which sends by total re<U+FB02>exion the light
of the lamp D, <U+FB01>g. 12, through the slit, whilst the rays from the
lamp E pass freely through the upper and uncovered half.                   A
small screen placed above the prism, prevents any of the light
from D passing through the upper portion of the slit. By
help of this arrangement the observer sees the spectra of thetwo
sources of light immediately one under the other, and can easily
determine whether the lines are coincident or not1'.
    We now proceed to describe the arrangement and mode of
using the instrument.
    The telescope B is <U+FB01>rst drawn out so far that a distant
object is plainly seen, and screwed into the ring, in which it is
held, care being taken to loosen the screws a and B beforehand.
The;tube A is then brought into its place, and the axis of B
brought into one straight line with that of A. The slit is then
 drawn out until it is distinctly seen on looking through the
 telescope, and this latter is then <U+FB01>xed by moving the screws or
 and B, so that'the middle of the slit is seen in about the middle
 of the <U+FB01>eld of view. After removing the small spring 7, the
 prism is next placed on the brass plate, and fastened in the
 position which is marked for        it,
                                       and secured     by  screwing down
 the spring '7.     If   the axis of the tube      A    be now directed
 towards   a bright surface, such as the <U+FB02>ame of            a   candle, the
 spectrum   of the <U+FB02>ame    is seen  in the lower  half  of  the  <U+FB01>eld of the
 telescope on moving the latter through        a certain angle round the
 axis of the foot F.       When the telescope has been placed in
position, the tube   C   is fastened on to the arm belonging to           it,
 and this  is turned through an angle round the axis of the foot
 such that, when   a  light      allowed to fall on the divided scale,
                                is
 the image of the scale        seen through the telescope
                              is                                 B, re<U+FB02>ected
from the nearer face of the prism.              This image       is brought
  *   This millimetre-scale was drawn on stri of glass covered with thin
                                           a                          a
coating of lampblaek and wax dissolved in glycerine.       The divisions and
the numbers, which by transmitted light showed bright on     a   dark ground,
were represented in the                dark on a light ground.   It  would be
still better to employ, 'photograph
                           or the spectrum-apparatus, a   scale in which the
marks were liwht on  a    dark ground.   Such scales are beautifully made  by
Salleron and l‘erricr of Paris.
  1'  This apparatus was made in the celebrated optical and astronomical
atelier of C. A. Steinheilin   Munich.

           into focus by altering the position of the scale in the
  exactlé ; and by turning this tube on its axis, it is easy to make
  tube
  the line in which one side of the divisions on the scale lie,
  parallel with the line dividing the two spectra, and by means of
  the screw 8 to bring these two lines to coincide.
      In order to bring the two sources of light, D and E, into
  position, two methods may be employed.        One of these depends
  upon the existence of bright lines in the inner cone of the
  colourless gas-<U+FB02>ame, which have been so carefully examined by
'
  Swan.     If the lamp E be pushed past the slit, a point is easily
  found at which these lines become visible ; the lamp must then
  be pushed still further to the left, until these lines nearly or
  entirely disappear ; the right mantle of the <U+FB02>ame is now before
  the slit, and into this the head of substance under examination
  must be brought.      In the same way the position of the source
  of light D may be ascertained.
      The second method is as follows :—The telescope B is so
  placed that the brightest portion of the spectrum of the <U+FB02>ame of
  a candle is seen in about the middle of the <U+FB01>eld of view; the
  <U+FB02>ame is then placed before the ocular in the direction of the
  axis of the telescope, and the position before the slit determined
  in which the upper half of the slit appears to be the brightest;
  the lamp E is then placed so that the slit appears behind that
  portion of the <U+FB02>ame from which the most light is given off after
  the introduction of the head. In a similar way the position of
  the lamp D is determined by looking through the small prism
  and the lower half of the slit.
      By means of the screw 5, the breadth of the slit can be regu
  lated in accordance with the intensity of the light, and the
  degree of purity of spectrum which is required.         To cut 011'
  foreign light, a black cloth, having a circular opening to admit
  the tube C, is thrown over the prism P and the tubes A and B.
  The illumination of the scale is best effected _by means of a
  luminous gas-<U+FB02>ame placed before it ; the light can, if necessary,
  be lessened by placing a silver-paper screen close before the       1
  scale.   The degree of illumination suited to the spectrum under
  examination can then be easily found by placing this <U+FB02>ame at
  different distances.
      In order to obtain   representations of the spectra of caesium
  and rubidium corresponding to those of the other metals which
  we have given in our former paper, we have adopted the following
  course  :-                                                       _
     We placed the tube C in such a position that a certain
  division of the scale, viz. No. 100, coincided with Fraunhofer’s
  line “ D ” in the solar spectrum, and then observed the position
  of the dark solar lines A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H on the scale 5

   these several readings we called A, B, C, Ste.            An interpolation
   scale was then calculated and drawn, in which each division
   corresponded to a division on the scale of the instrument, and
   in which the points corresponding to the observations A, B, C,
   &c. were placed at the same distances apart as the same lines on
   our <U+FB01>rst drawings of the spectrum. By help of this scale, curves
   of the new spectra were drawn, in which the ordinates express
    the degrees of luminosity at the. various points on the scale,
   as judged of by the eye.             The lithographer then made the
    designs represented in <U+FB01>g. 4, Plate V. from these curves*.
        As in our <U+FB01>rst memoir, so here we have represented only
    those lines which, in respect to position, de<U+FB01>nition, and intensity,
    serve as the best means of recognition.           \Ve feel it necessary to
    repeat this statement, because it has not unfrcquently happened
    that the presence of lines which are not represented in our draw
    ings has been considered as indicative of the existence of new
    bodies.
        We have likewise added a representation of the potassium
    spectrum to those of the new metals for the sake of comparison,
    so that the close analogy which the spectra of the new alkaline
    metals bear to the potassium-spectrum              may be at once seen.
   'All three possess spectra which are continuous in the centre, and
    decreasing at each end in luminosity.           In the case of potassium
  l'this  continuous   portion   is most   intense,  in that of rubidium less
    intense, and in the caesium-spectrum the luminosity is least.
    In all three we observe the most intense and characteristic lines
   towards both the red and blue ends of the spectrum.
        Amongst the rubidium lines, those splendid ones named Rba
    and RbB are extremely brilliant, and hence are most suited for
   the recognition of the metal.          Less brilliant, but still very cha
    racteristic, are the lines Rbd and Rb'y.             From their position
   they    are  in a high degree remarkable, as they both full beyond
    Fraunhofer’s line A; and the outer one of them lies in an ultra
    red portion of the solar spectrum, which can only be rendered
    visible by some special arrangement.              The other lines, which
    are found on the continuous part of the spectrum, cannot so well
   be used as a means of detection, because they only appear when
    the substance is very pure, and when the luminosity is very
    great. Nitrate of rubidium, and the chloride, chlorate, and per
   chlorate of rubidium, on account of their easy volatility, show
       ' The coincidence of this chromolithograph plate with that published
   in the former memoir is by no means complete, but this does not seriously
   interfere with the utility of either of the representations; for if the posi
   tion of an observed line be found, by help of the scale above described, to
   be near to that of the line of any known substance, it is easy, by placing
   pome of this substance in one of the flames, and in the other some of the
   body under examination, to see whether the lines are comcident or not.

                  Analysis by Spectrum-observations.     .         509
these lines most distinctly.      Sulphate of rubidium and similar;
salts also give very beautiful spectra. Even silicate and phosphate -
of rubidium yield spectra in which all the details are plainly seen.
    The spectrum of caesium is especially characterized by the two
blue lines Use: and CsB ; these lines are situated close to the
blue strontia line 81‘8, and are remarkable for their wonderful
brilliancy and sharp de<U+FB01>nition.       The line CsS, which cannot be
so conveniently used, must also be mentioned.         The yellow and
green    lines represented  on  the  <U+FB01>gure,  which <U+FB01>rst    appear when
the luminosity is great, cannot so well be employed for the pur
pose of detecting small quantities of the caesium compounds; but
they may .be made use of with advantage as a test of the purity
of the caesium salt under examination.        They appear much more
distinctly   than do  the yellow and green lines in the potassium
spectrum, which, for this reason, we have not represented.
    As regards distinclness of the reaction, the caesium com
pounds resemble in every respect the corresponding rubidium
salts : the chlorate, phosphate, and silicate gave the lines perfectly
clearly.     The delicacy of the reaction, however, in the case of
the caesium compounds is somewhat greater than in that of the
corresponding compounds of rubidium. In a drop of water
weighing 4 milligrammes, and containing only 0'0002 milli
gramme of chloride of rubidium, the lines Rho: and RbB can
only just be distinguished ; whilst 0'00005 milligramme of the
chloride of caesium can, under similar circumstances, easily be
recognized by means of the lines Csa and 058.
    If other members of the group of the alkaline metals occur
together with caesium and rubidium, the delicacy of the reaction
is of course materially impaired, as is seen from the following
experiments, in which the mixed chlorides contained in a drop
of water weighing about 4 milligrammes, were brought into the
<U+FB02>ame on a platinum wire.
    When 0'003 milligramme of chloride of caesium was mixed with
from 300 to 400 times its weight of the chlorides of potassium
 or sodium, it could be easily detected. Chlorideof rubidium, on
the other band, could be detected with dif<U+FB01>culty when the quan
 tity of chloride of potassiumor chloride of sodium amounted to
 100 to 150 times its weight of the chloride of rubidium employed.
    0'001 milligramme of chloride of caesium was easily recog
nized when it was mixed with 1500 times its weight of chloride
 of lithium; whilst 0'001 milligramme of chloride of rubidium
 could not be recognized when the quantity of chloride of lithium
 added exceeded 600 times the weight of the rubidium salt.
    At the close of this memoir     we cannot refrain  from touching
 upon a question     to which,   on some    future occasion, we must

510            Mr. W. S. B. Woolhouse on certain Triadz'c
again recur.     Amongst the large number of those salts already
examined by us, which, owing to their volatility in the <U+FB02>ame,
render a spectrum-analysis possible, we have not found, in spite
of the great variation in the elementary bodies combined with
the metal, a single one which failed to produce the characteristic
bright lines of the metal.    Considering these numerous obser
vations, made under the most widely differing circumstances, we
might be led to suppose that in all cases the bright lines given
out by a body occur quite independently of the other elements
chemically combined with that body, and that therefore the
relation of the elements, as regards the spectra of their vapours,
is exactly the same, whether they are free or chemically com
bined. Yet this supposition is by no means founded on fact.
We have repeatedly insisted that the bright lines in the spectrum
 of a luminous gas must coincide with the absorption lines which
this gas produces in a continuous spectrum of a suf<U+FB01>cient degree
 of luminosity. It is well known that the absorption lines of
 iodine vapour cannot be produced by hydriodic acid, and that,
 on the other hand, the absorption lines of nitrous acid are not
 visible in a mechanical mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.     There
 is nothing   to  show why an  in<U+FB02>uence of chemical combination
 upon the absorption lines, similar to that here noticed at low
 temperatures, should not occur at a white heat.              If,
                                                          however,
 the state of chemical combination alters the absorption lines of
a   luminous gas, it_must likewise alter the bright lines of its
spectrum.
   From these considerations one would conclude that in the
ease  of the spectra of two different compounds of the same
metal, di<U+FB02>'erent bright lines may appear;               is,
                                                however, possible
                                                   it
that the salts which are volatilized in the <U+FB02>ame cannot exist at
the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame, and are decomposed, so that     may    it
be in reality the vapour of the free metal which produces the
lines; and      would then appear quite possible that
                it                                      chemical
                                                               a
compound may produce bright lines differing from those pro
duced     by
           its constituent elements.

     symbols, p symbols in each ; with this limitation, that no com
     bination of 9 symbols which may appear in any one of them
     shall be repeated in any other.
    This question, which essentially involves a developed theory
of partitions, is more dif<U+FB01>cult than would at <U+FB01>rst appear; and it
has not yet received anything like an approach to a complete
general investigation,   although it has given rise to some able
papers on cognate subjects by Professor Sylvester, Mr. Cayley,
8m. in the Philosophical Magazine and other scienti<U+FB01>c 'ournals.
The Rev. T. P. Kirkman, who, like Professor Sylvester,                    has
                                                                gone
somewhat elaborately into the subject of partitions, and has
brought considerable ingenuity to bear upon his researches, has
made the largest contributions towards the solution of the pro
blem referred to.      His early investigations in this particular
<U+FB01>eld of inquiry led him to construct the following curious
triadic problem, which was proposed amongst the queries given
in the Lady’s and Gentleman’s Diary’ for 1850 :—
       ‘
   Fifteen young ladies in  aschool walk out three abreast for seven
     days in succession:     required to arrange them daily so that
                            it   is
     no two shall walk twice abreast.
   Two solutions, one of them              by   the talented   proposer,        were
printed in the Diary’ for 1851         but in these the results only

into general society, and become somewhat noted as fashionable      a
puzzle, while, more scienti<U+FB01>cally considered,      has not failed to

   Professor Sylvester, at the end of his paper “ On Four-valueda
Function,” printed in the Philosophical Magazine for June last,
page 520, has made some passing allusions to those mathe
maticians who, in common with himself, have contributed to
the subject under consideration.      On     recent perusal of this
                                                   a

 516 M. Dcville on     the  Arti<U+FB01>cial Formation of certain Minerals.
 by an ulterior reaction of aqueous vapour this is changed into
 crystals which are somewhat larger and more perfect.
     Hydrochloric acid also exercises a very curious reaction on
 amorphous titanic acid, changing it into very small crystals which
resemble anatase or rutilc.      They are very lustrous, and have a
bluish colour, like natural anatase. This blue colour arises from
a partial reduction of titanic acid ; for when this body was treated
in a reducing atmosphere by gaseous hydrochloric acid, small
crystals were obtained of a deep indigo-blue colour, the analysis
of which showed that they were a new oxide of titanium,
                        Ti8 05=Ti02, Ti9 03.
  ~
    Arti<U+FB01>cial rutile may also readily be obtained by the following
method devised by Deville in conjunction with Caron. When a
mixture of titanic acid and protoxide of tin is made, a titanate is
formed at a red heat, which silica decomposes, forming a silicate
and crystallized titanic acid.     The operation is effected by heat
ing to redness in an earthen crucible titanic acid along with oxide
of tin and a little sand. A gangue is formed rich in tin, and in
which are imbedded crystals of rutile 5 or 6 millims. in length.
Their form is that of native rutile; they are pure and colour
less if the materials are so, but they usually contain a trace of
iron or manganese, which give them the colour of native rutilc.
   In  the same manner Deville* has studied the formation of other
minerals.
    Magnetile.—-Magnetic oxide of iron was prepared by heating
protoxide of iron in a slow current of hydrochloric acid gas.
Protochloride of iron was formed, but no water.          The crystals
remaining in the tray were regular octahedra, and were found
on analysis to have the formula Fe8 O‘.         The protoxide of iron
was prepared by Debray’s method of heating sesquioxide of iron
in a mixture of equal volumes of carbonic acid and carbonic oxide
    ses.
gaPericlasc.—When        calcined magnesia was heated in a slow cur
rent of hydrochloric acid gas, it was transformed without any loss
into small crystals of periclase, which were sometimes white,
sometimes greenish, and occasionally yellow from the presence
of iron. Their form is the regular octahedron, and when pro
duced at a very high temperature they are of considerable size.
Chloride of magnesium in vapour is also decomposed by water,
forming transparent octahedra of periclase.
    Marlitc.——When a mixture of calcined magnesia and sesqui
oxide of iron was heated in a slow regular current of hydrochloric
acid, two distinct substances were produced; one of them was

  were found on analysis to have the composition Fe? O8 MgO,
  and are true spinelles.
     Hausmannite.——By heating red oxide of manganese in hydro
 chloric acid gas, small dimetric octahedra of Hausmannite,
  Mn" 03 MnO, were obtained.
     Protowide of Manganese—This was prepared by reducing any
 oxide of manganese in hydrogen, and heating it in the apparatus
 with a little hydrogen and a few bubbles of hydrochloric acid
 gas succeeding each other at long intervals.       The small quantity
 of the latter gas required is truly surprising, and it escapes from
 the apparatus unaltered.       The crystals obtained have a remark
 able lustre ; their colour is emerald-green, and they appear to be
 highly refringent, but exercise no action on polarized light.
 Their form is that of the cube-octahedron.
    The same chemist has made the following observations*.
 When <U+FB02>uoride of silicon is passed over oxide of zinc at a high
temperature, a mixture is formed of silicate and <U+FB02>uoride of zinc,
which dissolve each other.        The latter being volatile, on being
heated the silicate is left in hexagonal prisms large enough to
be readily measured, by which, and by their analysis, they were         I
identi<U+FB01>ed with native Willemite, 3ZnO, Sioa.
    Fluoride of zinc acting upon silica gave the same products; so
that a small quantity of <U+FB02>uoride of silicon could mineralizc an
inde<U+FB01>nite quantity of silica and oxide of zinc.
    Daubrée had stated that he had obtained Willemite and zircon
by the action of chloride of silicon upon oxide of zinc or of zir
conia.    Deville, who has repeated these experiments with care,
has found that neither Willemite nor zircon is formed; in fact
by passing chloride of zircon over Willemite this substance is
destroyed.     This result might be expected; for the chlorides of
silicon,  in  acting upon mineral oxides, do so not only by their
chlorine, but by the metalloid, which exerts a powerful reducing
action 5 and as the metallic chlorides formed under the in<U+FB02>uence
of the chloride of silicon never dissolve the silicates formed, there
is no reason why they should crystallize.       The reverse is the ease
with <U+FB02>uoride of silicon; it is to the solvent effects of this sub
stance on the silicates that its mineralizing properties are due.
A series of experiments on the action of chloride of silicon on
various metallic oxides, and which led to negative results, proved
the correctness of these views.

518       M. Roscnsthiehl on Monochlon'nated Sulphuric Add.
     A small glass bulb containing chloride of silicon was placed in
water containing some ammonia, and the bulb broken.            After
the decomposition, the liquid was still feebly alkaline; it was
allowed to stand for some days, then heated to boiling, <U+FB01>ltered,
and the silicic acid well washed out.     The chlorine was precipi
tated from the <U+FB01>ltrate by adding solution of nitrate of silver
acidulated with nitric acid, and the chloride of silver washed out
with water containing nitric acid. In two determinations 06738
and 1'3092 grm. of chloride of silicon gave respectively 2'277
and 4:4118 of chloride of silver, from which is obtained the average
2801 as the equivalent of silicon. The same number also fol
lows from the vapour-density of chloride of silicon (5'39) and
of <U+FB02>uoride of silicon (3'57), inasmuch as only the formula: SiCl‘
and SH?" correspond to the vapour-density.        Hence ilicon, like
 tin and titanium, is quadratomic.
     M. Rosensthiehl*  has investigated the action of anhydrous
sulphuric acid  u on  common     salt.  To a quantity of the former
substance, place   in a stoppered retort, a quantity of powdered
fused chloride of sodium was added.         As the anhydrous acid
generally contained  a  trace of  the  hydrated acid, suf<U+FB01>cient heat
was disengaged by the reaction thereby set up to melt the
anhydrous acid.     When the <U+FB01>rst reaction was over, the mix
ture was distilled until the residue fused. The distillate was
analysed, and was found to be monochlorinated        sulphuric acid
formed in virtue of the reaction,

M. Wilson    on-tlie Determination  of the Hardness of Water.    519
of water, which is a modi<U+FB01>cation of Clark’s original method.      He
uses a solution of sulphate of lime prepared by dissolving 1 part
CaO S03,2HO in 2543 parts of water.            This corresponds to
Clark’s standard solution of 16 parts CaO CO‘1 in 70,000 parts
of water.
    The solution of soap was prepared according to Faisst’s method
of dissolving 30 grms. of soda oil-soap in alcohol of 56° F., and
diluting this solution so that 32 cubic centims. were exactly
enough to produce, when shaken with 100 cubic centims. of the
normal gypsum solution, a froth which remained for <U+FB01>ve minutes.
By adding 4 cubic centims. of a cold saturated solution of car
bonate of soda the reaction is made more regular, inasmuch as it
changes all lime compounds into the carbonate which remains
dissolved.
    The experiments were made in the following manner:—-By
adding to the normal gypsum solution of 16 degrees hardness
corresponding quantities of distilled water, sixteen solutions were
prepared of_ from 1m 16 degrees hardness.         Of these solutions
100 cubic centims. were placed in a stoppercd glass cylinder of
400 cubic centims. capacity, with 4 cubic centims. of the cold
saturated solution of carbonate of soda, and solution of soap
added from a burette until, on agitation, a light froth was
formed.     The solution was then added very graduall with con
tinual agitation, until after the addition of the last rop a froth
was formed lasting <U+FB01>ve minutes.           The experimental results
showed that the use of every 2 cubic centims. of solution of soap
corresponds to 1 degree of hardness.
    In order to test the hardness of water, 100 cubic centims. are
measured off, 4 cubic centims. of saturated solution of carbonate
of soda added until a froth is formed which remains standing
<U+FB01>ve minutes.      The number of cubic centims. of soap-solution
divided by 2, gives the corresponding degree of hardness.
    This method is not applicable to waters of more than 16
degrees hardness.       “rith water of 20 degrees hardness, a pre
cipitate of carbonate of lime is formed on the addition of car
bonate of soda.        Such waters must be diluted to a proper
extent by the addition of distilled water.
    In order to ascertain whether salts of magnesia exhibit the
same de ortment, a solution of 1 part sulphate of magnesia
 (MgOS 3+7HO) was made in 1778 parts of water, which
corresponds to a gypsum solution of 16 degrees hardness.          By
corresponding dilution with distilled water, solutions of    1, 4, 8,
 12 degrees hardness were obtained, and these were estimated,
 after the addition of carbonate of soda, by means of soap-solu
 tion.   The same results were obtained as with solutions of lime.
    Wilson found,    as Faisst had previously done, that mixtures of

lime and magnesia salts do not require less solution of soap, as
stated by Dugald Campbell*.    Liebig states in a note toWilson’s
paper, that a determination made by Fink of the water of the
chemical laboratory corresponded to 16 degrees hardness.        A
determination of the quantity of alkaline earths contained in a
litre of water, gave 0‘114 grm. lime and 0035 grm. magnesia,
which together correspond to 16 degrees of hardness.
  Mendelejeff has investigated the expansion of liquids when
heated above their boiling-point'l'. These experiments were
made upon alcohol, ether, and water, and were effected by en
closing these liquids in glass tubes of about 300 millims. in
length, 4 millims. internal diameter, and about 2 millims. thick
in the glass. To free the liquid from air, some of the liquid was
boiled in them, and they were then sealed.    The upper part of
the tube was divided into millimetres.
   The tubes were heated by placing them vertically in a wide
glass tube, and passing a current of the vapour of absolute
alcohol,    water, amylic alcohol, or oil' of turpentine rapidly
 through the tube. The temperature was indicated by means of
 a thermometer placed along side the sealed tube.          The obser
 vations were made by means of a cathetometer, and were read
 off when the height of the liquid in the tube and the correspond
 ing temperature were constant.       The vapours, after being used
 for heating, passed into a condensing apparatus.         The experi
 ments were made with all possible precautions, the details of
 which are described in the paper.
    A very remarkable result was obtained from these experiments ;
that   is,that the empirical formulae of Kopp, which express the
expansibility of ether, alcohol, and water up to the boiling-point,
may also be applied with the same accuracy to the expansibility
at far higher temperatures.
    Mendcleje<U+FB01>‘ also found that this held good for benzole and
chloride of silicon, and concludes that the agreement of the cal
culated numbers with those obtained            experiment   byso close     is
that  it will probably prevail  with all liquids.
  It   further follows from these experiments that the expansion
of liquids above the boiling-point obeys the same laws as under
the boiling- oint,-—-that the coef<U+FB01>cient of expansion increases con
tinually and) gradually with diminution of the cohesion of the
liquid, that          is,
                    with an increase of temperature.      With some
liquids    it as much as that of gas at
                is                          certain temperature; for

some pieces of sulphur, some asbestos being placed between the
cork and the sulphur. The pumice was heated to redness and

LXVII.       On the Changes in the Induced Current by the employment
              of di<U+FB02>‘erent Resistances. By G. Msenus*.
            remarkably great power of hydrogen            to conduct heat
THEwhich I had            observed, induced me to compare the elec
trical conducting power of this gas with that of other gases.               I
encountered dif<U+FB01>culties, however, which at last compelled me to
believe that under certain hitherto unobserved circumstances
opposite currents are formed, and that by means of these the
irregularities of the de<U+FB02>ection of the magnetic needle which                I
noticed were brought about.          It was therefore necessary to in
vestigate the conditions under which these currents were ori
ginated.
    Poggcndorff has shown-t that if in the wire that completes the
circuit of an induction apparatus in which there is an “electric
egg,” and in which only currents of a given direction are circu~
lating, a Lcyden jar be introduced, both polar wires of the
“electric egg ” are covered with blue light.            Also the magnetic
needle of a galvanometcr placed in the current, though pre
viously undergoing de<U+FB02>ection, is now no longer turned aside,
from which be inferred that by the introduction of the Leyden
jar opposite currents were established.             Since then the pre
sence of blue light at the two poles of the
                                                       “ electric
                                                                   egg” has
almost always been looked upon as the sign of the existence of
opposite currents, and especially so, seeing that Ricssi had even
before this produced these appearances by opposite currents
quickly following one another.         It is certainly possible that blue
light at both poles may not in all cases be an indubitable sign of
the presence of opposite currents; still it is dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine
that these appearances should have another cause.               Nevertheless
I  shall not examine any further into this cause.            To understand
what follows,      I  emphatically remark that where the expression
opposite currents is used, nothing more is signi<U+FB01>ed than the pre
sence of negative light at both polar wires.           Dr. Paalzow §, in a
research which appeared a short time ago “On the different
ways of discharging the Leyden Battery, and on the Direction
of Principal and Secondary Currents,” used a similar pheno
menon as a test.         He, however, employed the so-callcd Geissler
tubes, and observed them between the poles of an active electro
magnet.       I  have made use of short tubes, 75 to 150 millims.
in length, and 5 to 15 millims. in diameter, which were sealed
 after the air that they contained had been rare<U+FB01>ed to from 4,

 their platinum wires and melted with them into the glass, are
 aluminium wires, the points of which are from 6 to 40 millims.
 apart.    If  wires are used made of platinum only, the tubes very
 soon become covered on their interior surface with a black
 coating which makes them almost opake.                     This is not the
 case when aluminium is employed; hence Geissler* has used
 this metal in the preparation of his tubes for a long time. Such
 tubes, when made use of for investigating direction,              I shall call
 test-tubes..
    For the experiments, induced currents only were used. For
 this purpose two induction-apparatus were at my disposal, made
 by Ruhmkor<U+FB01>' of Paris,—a smaller and older one, the dimensions
 of which may be considered as known, and a larger one, <U+FB01>nished
 only a few months ago, the induction-wire of which has a length
 of 40,000 metres, and (without taking into account the silk with
 which it is covered) a. diameter of 013 of a millim.
    For both instruments a battery of two of Bunsen’s elements
 was employed, with which the large coil furnished in the open
 air a spark of from 3 to 4 ccntims. in length.              If it were set in
 action by a large battery, a spark was obtained which had a.
 length of 39 ccntims.           The apparatus, however, could not be
 employed     of   such a   strength for the experiments to be men
 tioned presently.
    Besides the test-tube, another tube was used, in which were
 two platinum wires 1 millim. in thickness and rounded at the
ends, which wires, by means of a stuf<U+FB01>ng-box, could be placed
 at any desired distance from one another.                 In order to raref
 the air in this tube, it was attached to the air-pump.                   It is
 therefore distinguished from the electric egg by its being nar
 rower, as well as longer, and admitting of a greater removal
                                                         I
 of the wires. For the sake of distinction shall call this tube
 the air-tube.
     If this air-tube, together with the test-tube, be inserted in
    * It has often been maintained that particles of platinum are thrown
-over from the negative to the positive wire. This seems to me to be with
 out foundation in the case of induced currents; for if the discharge takes
 place through such a tube as has already been described, during a long time
 and always in the same direction, it becomes covered with a black coating
 only in that part of the tube where the negative wire is, whilst in the
 neighbourhood of the positive wire no deposit is perceived even after a
 much longer time.       I  believe, therefore, that the black coating origi
 nates thus :—the platinum of the negative wire is either volatilized or
 thrown away from it, but not exactly towards the positive wire.      For if the
 tube contain aluminium wires which are so short that the negative light
 extends over a part of the platinum wire to which the aluminium is attached,
 then the black coating is only formed in the neighbourhood of the platinum
 which is entirely removed from the        sitive wire.

52L       Prof. Magnus    on the Changes     in the Induced Current
the circuit of the induced current of either of the two induction
apparatus, and if by a certain rarefaction and a certain separa
tion of the ends of the two wires only single currents make their
appearance, then opposite currents are always formed if the ends
of the wires are separated to such an extent that the electricity
no longer passes between them in a luminous line, but spreads
itself out in a brush-like form.        On a further separation of the
wires, opposite currents in every case show themselves in the
test-tube.      Instead of moving the wires, the same result can be
 obtained by gradually increasing the density of the air in the
'tube; in this case also, as soon as the brush-like discharge com
 mences in the tube, the currents begin to be in opposite directions.
     I believe it must be inferred from this that an increase of
 resistance gives rise to the opposite currents; and         I  have there
 fore employed the resistancc of liquid and solid conductors
 instead of that of air.       For this purpose the air-tube was re
 placed by a glass tube 1 metre in length and 3 millims. in dia
 meter, in which two platinum wires could be approached towards,
 or separated from one another at pleasure.           If this tube be <U+FB01>lled
 with a saline solution, even if it contained only 025 per cent. of
 sulphate of potash, and if the wires were 900 millims. apart, it
 Was impossible to obtain opposite currents.              When, however,
‘the tube contained pure water, the result was like that obtained
 by employing the air-tube.          By a certain removal of the wires,
 only single     currents  were   produced, whereas by a further sepa
 ration they     were   opp0site.    It is likewise possible to produce
 opposite currents by means of the resistance of metallic conduc~
 tors; it only needs for this purpose (provided, in addition to the
 test-tube, no air- or water-tube is inserted) the spiral of the
 large induction-coil, 40,000 metres in length, as a means of
 resistance;     for, on the production of currents by the small
 induction-apparatus,     they then make their appearance with great
  distinetness.
     Further, if the resistance is increased in other ways, negative
  light appears on both wires. If the sparks from the large induc~
  tion-apparatus are allowed to traverse the air and then a test
  tube is inserted into the conducting wire, as long as the spark
  traverses the air vigorously, negative light is seen at only one
  pole of the test-tube; but if the spark goes through the air with
  a hissing noise, negative light appears at both poles.
     We likewise obtain, b the introduction of a thin plate of
'mica into the circuit, whic latter, with the exception of the test
  tube, consists of nothing but metallic conductors, negative light
  on both wires.      The same effect is produced, as Poggendor<U+FB01>‘*
                " Poggeiidor<U+FB02>’l-Anaalen, vol. xciv. p. 326.

has already shown, when a Leyden                jar is introduced      into the
circuit.
   If, instead of introducing the test-tube into the induction wire,
we attach it to one end of the same and conduct the other to
 the earth, we likewise obtain opposite currents; or, to explain
myself more cautiously, negative light appears at both wires.
   If  we melt into a small tube, which contains very rare<U+FB01>ed air,
 only one wire and then attach it to one end of the induction
coil whilst the other is in contact with the earth, we obtain, if the
tube be freely suspended in air, a luminous appearance on the
above wire, which appearance is always of negative light; the
tube may be in connexion with either end of the induction-wire ;
or, supposing it to remain at the same end, the current may
 traverse the wire in either direction.    The intensity of the light
is increased if we approach the tube with a conductor from the
outside.
    In how peculiar a manner glass in<U+FB02>uences the discharge, is
seen from the following observation.                    If
                                               the air-tube be intro
duced into the wire which completes the circuit, and if its wires
be so far separated that only single currents circulate, whilst on
their being further removed from each other opposite currents
arise, the passage from one wire to the other ceases as soon as
the tube, thus arranged, is grasped with the hand; whilst in the
test-tube that also forms a part of the circuit, opposite currents
are immediately     perceived.   At the same time we observe                      (if
not always,      itfrequently
                      is       the  case) that the electricity in the
air-tube passes to the glass.     This phenomenon likewise makes
its appearance in the electric egg;              necessary, however,

526      Prof. Magnus        on the Changes     in the Induced Current
of the air-tube is too great for the intensity of the current which
this apparatus produces; consequently we also <U+FB01>nd that the dis
charge no longer takes place in the shape of a bright luminous
line, but in a brush-like form.
    Not only are opposite currents produced if the resistance be
too great in proportion to the intensity of the current, but also
if the same be too small in relation to the discharge.
     If we choose such a separation of the polar wires in the air
tube that the employment of the small induction-apparatus pro
duces single currents, and if we then exchange the above
mentioned for the large coil, opposite currents are generated.
    We can obtain a. similar result with one and the same induc
tion-apparatus.          If we attach the two ends of the spiral of
the large induction-apparatus to the test-tube, and likewise
insert the air-tube, in which the air is rare<U+FB01>ed as much as pos
sible, we see, when the polar wires of the latter are brought
suf<U+FB01>ciently near together, that both are covered with intense
negative light.        Let these wires be separated from one another,
and it will be found that the negative light on the positive wire
will gradually decrease, and increase on the negative wire, until
the positive wire is entirely devoid of light.            Could the wires be
separated su<U+FB02>iciently, we should again have opposite currents;
but the tube is not long enough for this. This result is obtained,
however, by gradually admitting air into the tube and thereby
increasing the resistance.
    The idea suggests itself that these opposite currents, formed
under so tri<U+FB02>ing a resistance, may have their origin therein—that
not only by the breaking, but also by the establishing of the cir
cuit, a current may be induced.              It is well known that Poggen
dor<U+FB02>'* has shown that, if the ends of an induction-coil are con
nected by means of a metallic wire or a liquid which is a good con
ductor, induced currents are formed on completing as well as on
the induced current considerably more than the hammer used by Ruhm
limit for his small               does, which hammer by its own weight com
  lctes the circuit. apparatus
                         he latter has; however, an irregular action.    I hoped
by altering it in different ways to obtain a more regular movement, and for
this purpose 1 employed two plates of osmium-iridium in order to avoid
the adhesion, but 1 obtained no more favourable result.            The contact
breaker made for the large induction-coil is in any case preferable.           It
likewise possesses the advantage, that we can accelerate its working at
pleasure by shortening the pendulum attached to it.          It is not, however,
completely regular in its motion.
    A short time ago Ricss constructed an ap aratus by means of which the
breaking of the contact was brought about y clockwork—one of Miilzel’s
mctronomes.       It is possible that it will have a more regular action in con
se uence.                            ‘

breaking the circuit, which circulate alternately to and fro.
Since then, Gassiot* has called attention to the fact that we
obtain a luminous appearance in tubes prepared by his method,
on establishing the primary current, provided we use ten or
more elements for the production of this current.
      It
       was probable, therefore, that, if a test-tube were inserted
which contained only a short stratum of very rare<U+FB01>ed air, on esta
blishing the principal current, generated in this case by two of
Bunsen’s elements, an induced current would be formed.                 This
was found to     be the  case ; for  if the  current was established by
dipping the platinum wire of the contact-breaker only once with
the hand into the amalgam, a luminous appearance was obtained
in the test-tube, which, however, was considerably weaker than
that produced by breaking the circuit. The opposite currents,
observed with a very tri<U+FB02>ing resistance, depend therefore partly on
the induced current which originates on completing the circuit.
           I
Still, believe them to depend only partly thereon; for the cur

of the contact, that there      isclosing and breaking in succession                 3

ing of the contact the luminous appearance in the test-tube was
always the same, whether the separation was produced quickly,
by withdrawing     a  platinum point from the amalgam, or slowly,
 by  disconnecting   two   copper surfaces like those in the rheotrope.
    The following observation likewise shows the probability of
the production of opposite currents in the induction-wire                       by   a
single breaking of the circuit.
     It has just been mentioned that,         ifwe choose such       separa
                                                                       a
tion of the polar wires in the air-tube that the employment of
the small induction-apparatus produces single currents, and
if  we then replace this apparatus              by
                                                 the large coil, opposite
currents are obtained.        If, whilst the small induction-coil                    is
in action, we <U+FB01>rst of all observe in the well-rare<U+FB01>ed air-tube
the negative wire,     it  appears to be covered to            considerable

length With bluish light, whilst the positive, on the other hand,
is  entirely non-luminous.         Ifwe then employ the large induc~
tion-apparatus,    a  much smaller part of the negative wire                         is
blue, whereas now      a portion of the positive wire shines with this
colour; the wires comport themselves just in this way                    the

not yet proved that opposite currents are produced by suf<U+FB01>
ciently weak resistance, still at the very least it is highly proba
ble that such is the case.
   Moreover, both Dr. chdcrscn* and Dr. Paalzow have found
that when the Lcydcn battery is discharged, opposite currents
make their appearance if the resistance be tri<U+FB02>ing.
   We may therefore regard as proved that induced currents are
only single with a certain amount of resistance.    Let the resist
ance exceed a <U+FB01>xed limit, and they are oppoaite ; let it likewise
sink below another certain limit, and they are also opposite.
These boundaries vary according to the intensity of the current.
           On   the Changes   of Colour of Electric Light.
   In  the test-tubes that    l
                              have employed, the negative light,
which in rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheric air is generally of an intense blue,
is almost white; and in like manner the light extending from
the positive pole to the dark intervening space was white, though
it is usually red.  I  have endeavoured to <U+FB01>nd out the _cause of
these variations of colour.
    When a newly-made tube of the prescribed kind is used, the
negative light is at <U+FB01>rst blue, and the space between the wires is
<U+FB01>lled with red light; but soon afterwards both become brighter.
The space between the two wires becomes brown, and <U+FB01>nally
white, and in the same way the negative light becomes entirely
whitish. When this change has once been effected, the colour
in the hermetically-sealed tube remains unchanged. If, however,
we use a tube which can be opened, and consequently can have
its air renewed, the negative light is at <U+FB01>rst blue and the inter
vening space red, but immediately afterwards both become white
a am.
  8This change cannot depend on the union of oxygen with alu
 minium ; for in nitrogen gas, which in this case would be
left, the colour of the electric light is very similar to what it
 is in atmospheric air.      The appearance is most like that of the
 electric light in carbonic acid or hydrogen; but as neither of
 these gases was present, it occurred to me that perhaps the alu
 minium, during its preparation, might have come in contact with
 some foreign substance (some greasy matter for instance), and
 that by this means the phenomenon was brought about.             Two
 aluminium wires, which were cut out of rolled plate, were conse
 quently puri<U+FB01>ed by scraping as much as possible, and without
 being touched by the <U+FB01>ngers were fused into the tube.          Under
 these circumstances     the  wire retained the light unchanged from
        it was  at the <U+FB01>rst  moment,    thatis,continually blue at the
_what
 negative   wire,  and red  in the intervening  space.

    On the Measurement      of the Intensity of Electric Currents.     529
    After the supposition, that the change in colour arose from
the presence of a foreign substance, had thus been con<U+FB01>rmed,               I
found that in so narrow a tube even the smallest quantity of
fatty matter on the negative wire was suf<U+FB01>cient to make the
light white.       Mere contact with the <U+FB01>ngers is often suf<U+FB01>cient for
this purpose; and, indeed, not only by the employment of wires
of aluminium, but likewise of copper, brass, platinum, and pro
bably every other metal which is not volatile at the temperature
in question, the same results are obtained.         On the positive wire
fat produces little or no effect;      it may either be placed on its
point, or at some distance from it.
     Tallow, fatty oils, stearic acid, and wax behave all in a similar
way.       \Vhen we place some of either of the above on the nega
tive wire, the greasy part appears red at <U+FB01>rst, whilst the rest of
 the wire shines with blue light.           Immediately afterwards the
 spot is surrounded with a mantle of reddish light which gradu.
 ally disappears.      The blue light on the rest of the wire simul
 taneously turns white, and the red light between the two wires
 likewise changes to brown and white.             It is probable that the
 fat was decomposed, but through the quantity being so small
 the decomposition could not be proved.

 although they were discussed in Liebig and Kopp’s Jalzresberic/Il.

length of the needle.
   Though this equation is very similar to my formula. of correc
tion, yet both are not identical, and do not afford the same
approximation to real intensity. As M. Gaugain’s arrangement
considerably lessens the sensibility of tangent-galvanometers, and
as it cannot be applied to the construction of multipliers, it may
perhaps be of use and interest to call to mind the formula of
correction which         I
                    gave in 1855.

                 LXIX.      On the Circularily of the Sun’s Disc.
                  By   G. B. AIRY, Esq., Astronomer Royal*.
          has been proposed         lately to prepare an apparatus for the
 IT purpose           of examining whether the Sun’s disc is really cir
cular, and in particular for ascertaining whether the diameters
nearl perpendicular to the ecliptic are equal to those nearly
paral cl to the ecliptic.            I would not by any means discourage
the trial of such apparatus; but I would unhcsitatingly express
my opinion that the result of the trial would be to show whether
the apparatus is or is not trustworthy, and not to give any new
information regarding the measure of the Sun’s diameters in any
degree comparable to that which we already possess.
    Perhaps few persons except professional astronomers are aware
of the enormous amount of evidence which already exists in refer
ence to the values of the Sun’s diameters,_and                            of the way in
which this evidence is growing every day in the ordinary routine
of meridional observations.              To make this full understood,                           I
will here explain what is prepared in the Nautical Almanac, what
is observed at the Royal Observatory, how the observations are
   '   From the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical                   Society, Janu
ary 10, 1862.

                            of the Sun’s Disc.                    533
reduced, and how the comparison of the reduced observations
with the numbers of the Nautical Almanac bears upon the sub
ject now before us.
      For the calculations of the Nautical Almanac, an assumption
 is made as to the numerical value of the Sun’s diameter as seen
 when the Earth is at its mean distance from the Sun.          It mat
 ters not whether this assumed diameter is or is not correct, pro_
 vided that it be used consistently in all the calculations of each _
 year; and it matters not whether it be or be not changed from
 year to year, provided that each volume contain a statement of
 the assumed diameter which has actually been used in the calcu
 lations of that volume.      Thus the assumed value of Sun’s dia
  meter,    as  seen  at  Earth’s   mean distance, in the Nautical
  Almanacs from 1836 to 1852 was 32’ 1”'80 ; that in the subse
  quent Nautical Almanacs is 32' 3”'64|.
      With the diameter thus assumed, two sets of numbers are
  computed in the Nautical Almanac.          One is the apparent dia
  meter (or semidiamctcr)     of  the Sun at  noon on every day; this
  is found by merely altering the assumed diameter in the inverse
  proportion of the Earth’s varying distance from the Sun. The
  other is the duration of passage of the Sun’s diameter across
  the meridian, or the measure of the sidereal time which elapses
  between the passage of the Sun’s western limb and its eastern
  limb; this is found from the apparent diameter of the day, by
   introducing the consideration of the Sun’s declination and of the
   Sun’s motion in right ascension.        And these numbers being
   prepared, it is evident that we have elements which correspond
   very closely with facts that may be observed, the elements being
   essentially based on the supposition        that the Sun’s disc is
   circular.
       Corresponding to these two classes of computed elements, we
   have two classes of facts observed at the Royal Observatory and
    at other observatories.   One is the zenith distance of the Sun’s
   upper   limb   and  that of  the Sun’s lower limb.    When each of
    these is corrected separately for refraction and parallax, the true
   results of geocentrie observation are obtained ; and the difference
    between them gives the observed vertical diameter of the Sun on
    the day of observation.    The other is the sidereal time shown by
    the transit-clock at the instant of transit of the Sun’s western
    limb, and that at the transit of the Sun’s eastern limb; the dif
    ference between these gives the observed duration of passage of
    the Sun’s horizontal diameter across the meridian on the day of
    observation.
       Now if we compare each of these numbers separately (namely,
    the observed vertical diameter and the observed duration of pas
    sage of horizontal diameter) with the corresponding numbers in

   534           The Astronomer Royal on     the Circular-in
   the Nautical Almanac, and if we omit consideration of chance
   errors of observation, the effect of which may be supposed to be
   nearly eliminated in the mean of many observations, the follow
   ing results ought to hold :—If the Sun’s disc is really circular,
   and if the Nautical-Almanac assumed diameter at mean distance
   is correct, then the observed vertical diameter will agree with the
   Nautical-Almanac diameter for the day, and the observed dura—
   tion of passage will agree with that of the Nautical Almanac.
'
   If the Sun’s disc is really circular, but the assumed diameter in
  correct, thcn neither of the compared measures will agree with
  the corresponding computation of the Nautical Almanac; each
   discordance (one of vertical diameter, the other of duration of
  passage of horizontal diameter) will indicate a numerical value
  of correction to be applied to the assumed diameter; but the two
  numerical values will absolutely agree.      But if the Sun’s disc is
  not really circular, then it is impossible that the comparison of
  observed vertical diameters on the one hand, and of observed
  durations of passage of horizontal diameters on the other hand,
  with elements computed on the supposition that the Sun is cir
  cular, can indicate the same correction to the assumed semi
  diameter.
      All that is necessary, therefore, for ascertaining whether the
  Sun’s horizontal diameter and the Sun’s vertical diameter are
  equal, is every day to compare the Sun’s observed vertical dia
  meter with the Nautical-Almanac diameter, and the observed
  duration of passage of Sun’s horizontal diameter with the Nau
  tical-Almanac duration, and to infer separately from these the
  correction to be made to the Nautical-Almanac assumed dia
  meter.     If the two results agree, the horizontal and vertical
  diameters are equal.
      Now these comparisons are made every day in the routine of
  the Royal Observatory; and their results will be found in one of
  the late sections of each volume of the printed ‘Grcenwich Obser
  vations,’ as well as in the more extensively distributed ‘ Results
  of the Greenwich Observations,’ which contain that section ; and
  the means of the numbers for each year are given in the Intro
  duction to each volume.      By extracting these numbers, the fol
  lowing Table is formed.      I  have thought it necessary to divide
  the Table into three parts, distinguished by the following cir
  cumstances :—From 1836 to 1850 the 4-inch telescope (I believe
  Dollond’s) of the Mural Circle was used for the vertical diame
  ters, and the 5-inch telescope (Dollond’s) of the Transit for the
  horizontal passages; the diameter used in the computations of
  the Nautical Almanac was 32' l”'80.        Through 1851 and 1852
  the 8-inch telescope (Simms’s) of the Transit Circle was used
  for both measures, the Nautical-Almanac assumed diameter

                                   of the Sun’s Disc.                                          535
being still 32' 1"‘80. From 1853 to 1860 the telescoPe of the
Transit-Circle was used for both measures, but the Nautical
Almanac assumed diameter was 32’ 3”'64~.

     Thus the observations with both classes of instruments, in ag
gregate number 2487 for horizontal diameter, and 2694 for ver
tical diameter, agree in showing that the horizontal diameter
exceeds the vertical diameter by only 0’"1, a quantity smaller
than we can answer for in these or in any other methods of ob
servation.
     A consideration        of the number and excellence of the observa
tions fully supports the view which I have stated in introducing
this subject,—-that the only result which could be deduced from
the trial of new apparatus would be to test the apparatus, but
not to add to the certainty of the conclusion as to the equality
of diameters.
     The diameter adopted new in the Nautical Almanac was in
ferred from observations made with the Transit and Mural Circle,
and therefore agrees very closely with that here deduced from the
use of those instruments.               That obtained with the Transit Circle
 is  less  by   0'"93.

    “Description of a new Optical Instrument called the ‘Stereo
trope’."     By William Thomas Shaw, Esq.                      ~
    This instrument is an application of the principle of the stereo
 scope to that class of instruments variously termed thaumatropes,
 phantaseopes, phenakistoscopes,    &c., which depend for their results
 on “ persistence of vision.”    In these instruments, as is well known,
 an object represented on a revolving disc, in the successive positions
it assumes in performing a given evolution, is seen to execute the
 movement so delineated; in the stereotropc the effect of solidity is
 superadded, so that the object is perceived as if in motion and with
an appearance of relief as in nature. The following is the manner in
which   I adapt to this purpose the refracting form of the stereoscope.
    Having procured eight stereoscopic pictures of an object—of a
 steam-engine for example—in the successive positions it assumes in
 completing a revolution, I atlix them, in the order in which they were
 taken, to an octagonal drum, which revolves on a horizontal axis
 beneath an ordinary lenticular stereoscope and brings them one
after another into view. Immediately beneath the lenses, and with
its axis situated half an inch from the plane of sight, is <U+FB01>xed a solid
cylinder, 4 inches in diameter, capable of being moved freely on its
 axis. This cylinder, which is called the eye-cylinder, is pierced
throughout its entire length (if we except a diaphragm in the centre
inserted for obvious reasons) by two apertures, of such a shape, and
 so situated relatively to each other, that a transverse section of the
cylinder shows them as cones, with their apiees pointing in opposite
directions, and with their axes parallel to, and distant half an inch
from, the diameter of the cylinder. Attached to the axis of the eye
eylinder is a pulley, exactly one-fourth the size of a similar pulley
af<U+FB01>xed to the axis of the picture-drum, with which it is connected
by means of an endless band. The eye-cylinder thus making four
revolutions to one of the picture—drum, it is evident that the axes of
its apertures will respectively coincide with the plane of sight four
times in one complete revolution of the instrument, and that,
consequently, vision will be permitted eight times, or once for each
picture.
    The cylinder is so placed that at the time of vision the large ends
of the apertures are next the eyes, the effect of which is that when
the small ends pass the eyes, the axes of the apertures, by reason of
their eccentricity, do not coincide with the plane of sight, and vision
is therefore impossible.    If, however, the position of the cylinder be
reversed end for end, vision will be possible only when the small ends
are next the eyes, and the angle of the aperture will be found to sub
tend exactly the pencil of rays coming from a picture, which is so
  laced as to be bisected at right angles by the plane of sight. Hence
it follows that, the former arrangement of the cylinder being re
verted to, the observer looking along the upper side of the aperture
will see a narrow strip extending along the top of the picture; then,
moving the cylinder on and looking along the lower side of the
aperture, he will see a similar strip at the bottom of the picture;
consequently, in the intermediate positions of the aperture, the other

parts of the picture will have been projected on the retinas.       The
width of. these strips is determined by that of the small ends of the
apertures, which measure “125 inch; and the diameter of the large
ends is 1'5 inch, the lenses being distant 9 inches from the pictures.
The picture—drum being caused to revolve with the requisite rapidity,
the observer will see the steam-engine constantly before him, its
position remaining unchanged in respect of space, but its parts will
appear to be in motion, and in solid relief, as in the veritable object.
The stationary appearance of the pictures, notwithstanding the fact
of their being in rapid motion, is brought about by causing their
corresponding parts to be seen, respectively, only in the same part
of space, and that for so short a time that while in view they make
no sensible progression. As, however, there is an actual progression
during the instant of vision, it is needful to take that fact into
account—in order that it may be reduced as far as practicable—in
regulating the diameter of the eye-cylinder, and of the apertures at
their small ends ; and the following are the numerical data involved
in the construction of an instrument with the relative proportions
given above :—
   The circumference of picture-drum=22'5 inches
   The circumference of eye-cylinder=l2 inches x 4 revolutions=48
inches (B).
   The diameter of apertures at large ends= 1'5 inch
   The diameter of apertures at small ends='125 inch
   While the large end is passing the eye, the picture under view
progresses        14-8?
                               of   22-5   (A), or 703 inch.
   This amount of progression ('703 in.),   perceived at one and the
                                                           if
same instant, would be utterly destructive of all distinctness of de<U+FB01>
nition;  but      evident that the total movement brought under
                  it      is
visual observation             at any one moment          is                 of '703 inch, or
'058 inch. This movement must necessarily occasion          corresponding    a
slurring, so to speak, of the images on the retina; and the fact of
such slurring not affecting, to an appreciable extent, the distinctness
of de<U+FB01>nition, seems to be referable to     faculty which the mind has
                                                      a

regularities in the organ of vision; as    further illustration of which

interprets as the effect of the presence before the eye of a single
minute object. That this corrective power

   “ On
          Systems of Linear Indeterminate Equations and Congru
ences.” By H. J. Stephen Smith, Esq., M.A.
   The present communication relates to the theory of the solutio
in positive and negative integral numbers, of systems of linear inde
terminate equations, having integral coef<U+FB01>cients.      In connexion with
this theory, a solution is also given of certain problems relating to
rectangular matrices, composed of integral numbers, which are of
frequent use in the higher arithmetic.         Of this kind are the two
following :—
     l. “ Given (in integral numbers) the values of the determinants
of any rectangular matrix of given dimensions, to <U+FB01>nd all the
matrices, the constituents of which are integers, and the determinants
of which have those given values.
     2. “ Given any rectangular matrix, the determinants of which
have a given number D for their greatest common divisor, to <U+FB01>nd
all the supplementary matrices, which, with the given matrix, form
square matrices, of which the determinant is D.”
     A solution of particular, but still very important cases of these
two problems, has been already given by M. Hermite. The method
by which in this paper their general solution has been obtained,
 depends on an elementary,       but apparently fertile principle in the
 theory of indeterminate linear systems; viz. that if m be the index
of indeterminateness of such a system        e. the excess of the number
                                                 (i.
of indeterminates above the number of really independent equations),
it   is always possible to assign     set of m solutions, such that the
                                       a
 determinants of the matrix formed by them shall admit of no
common divisor but unity.
     Such   aset of solutionsis termed fundamental set, and possesses
                                            a
the characteristic property, that every other solution of the system
 can be integrally expressed      bymeans of the solutions contained in
 it.  A   set of independent solutions    one in which the determinants
                                            is
 of the matrix have     a  <U+FB01>nite common divisor,     e. are not all zero.
                                                        i.
 The theory of independent and fundamental sets of solutions in some
 respects resembles that of independent and fundamental systems of
 units in Lejeune Dirichlet’s celebrated generalization of the solution
 of the Pellian equation.
      By the aid of the same principle of fundamental sets, the follow

   The following result (among many which may be deduced from
this transformation of a square matrix) admits of frequent ap
plications  :—
   “  If D  be the greatest common divisor of the determinants of the
matrix of any system of n independent linear equations; of the D"
sets of values (incongruous mod. D) that may be attributed to
the absolute terms of the equations, the system is resolublc for
D"-1 , and irresoluble for D""1 ( D—l).”
   As an example of the use that may be made of this result, it is
shown, in conclusion, that it supplies an immediate demonstration of
a fundamental principle in the general theory of complex integral
numbers, composed of the root of any irreducible equation, having
its <U+FB01>rst eoe<U+FB02>ieient unity, and all its coef<U+FB01>cients integral; viz. that
the number of incongruous residues, for any modulus, is always
represented by the norm of the modulus.                 A demonstration of this

    Whilst pursuing our investigation of Burmese naphtha, an abstract
of which we have already communicated to the Society, we noticed,
among the products of the action of nitric acid on certain liquid
hydrocarbons contained in Rangoon tar, an acid of peculiar pro
 perties.   A very lengthened investigation of this acid and its de_

rivatives we are about bringing to a close; but as the drawing up of
this account will necessarily occupy a considerable time, we have
thought it desirable to send a short abstract of the chief results we
                                                                       ’

the Society.
     M. Caillot, about <U+FB01>fteen years ago, obtained a peculiar acid
among the products of the action of dilute nitric acid on oil of tur
pentine, to which he gave the name of Terephthalic acid, on account
of its generation from oil of turpentine and its isomerism with
phthalic acid.       M. Caillot’s account of his new acid was so
brief and incomplete, that, although we recognized many points of
resemblance between it and the acid we had obtained from Burmese
naphtha, we were compelled to repeat his experiments on oil of
 turpentine before we could <U+FB01>x with certainty the identity of the two
    roducts.   In the course of these ex eriments, in which that
identity was fully established, we notice some interesting features
 in the compounds of the acid and the derivatives we discovered;
 more especially the relation of terephthalic acid to the well-known
 aromatic series,—a relation precisely analogous to that which suc
 cinic acid bears to the fatty acids. The close relation which exists
 between terephthalic acid and benzoic acid is most strikingly mani
fested in the great number of derivatives which are obtained from
the former; indeed, nearly all of the most characteristic benzoyl
 compounds have their analogues amongst the derivatives of tere
 phthalic acid. Terephthalic acid being a bibasic acid, maintains its
 character throughout its various transformations, and it is this fact
 which claims particular interest.
     Terephthalic acid, as well as its derivatives, forms the <U+FB01>rst term of
 a new series of well-characterized bodies, and may, as such, be con
 sidered the prototype of a great number of compounds still unknown.
     Without dwelling at present on the tedious process by which
 terephthalic acid is produced, we may mention that it is obtainable
 from various sources.     We have, for instance, found that it is in
 variably formed, in a relatively small proportion, when toluylic acid
 is prepared from cymole ; it is also formed when cymole is treated
 with fuming nitric acid for the purpose of preparing nitrotoluylic
 acid. It is important to mention, that whether the cymole be pre
 pared t'rom oil of cumin or from cnmphor, the result is the same.
      Subsequently, we found that insolinic acid, which was described
 some years ago by Hofmann as a new acid of the formula C” 151'I 0‘,
  is in reality terephthalic acid.    The formation of this acid from
 oil of cumin or cuminic aldehyde by the action of chromic acid
  011 these  substances, turned out to be the most ready method of
 preparing terephthalic acid; and the principal part of our experi
 ments were made with terephthalic acid which had been obtained
 from oil of cumin by this process.
      Terephthalic acid being isomeric with phthalic acid, has the
 formula C’H“O‘ (Carbon=l2, Oxygen=16), as already known.
 When pure, it forms a white opake powder; but if thrown down
 from a boiling dilute alkaline solution, it may be obtained in a

De la Rue and Miiller       on Terephthalic    Acid and its Derivatives.  543
crystalline state.     When collected on a <U+FB01>lter, these crystals dry in
paper-like masses of a silky lustre. Terephthalic acid is not per
ceptibly soluble in ether, chloroform, acetic acid, water, or the other
usual solvents. Concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves it to a con
siderable extent, especially when warm, without the formation of
sulpho-terephthalic acid, and the acid separates unchanged on the
addition of water.       On heating, terephthalic acid sublimes without
previously fusing.      The    sublimate, which is indistinctly crystalline,
has the same composition and properties as the original acid, and
therefore, unlike other bibasic acids, terephthalic acid cannot be
converted into an anhydride by merely heating it. Terephthalic
acid exhibits a remarkable deportment with regard to its salts; for
although bibasic, there appear to exist no double salts; and even
                                                                 '
acid salts are only prepared with the greatest di<U+FB02>iculty.
    The alkaline terephthalates are all very soluble in water, but are
insoluble in alcohol.      The potassium, sodium, and ammonium com
   ounds can be obtained in well-crystallized forms. The calcium and
liarium salts are less soluble than the before-named, and may be ob
tained in small scaly crystals.            The copper salt is a pale blue
crystalline powder.       The    silver  and  the lead salt occur as curdy
precipitates    when   obtained     by   double   decomposition.    The com
pounds     of terephthalic   acid   with  the  alcohol radicals possess a par
 ticular interest, as they furnish the most direct proof of the bibasic
nature of the acid. There exist neutral and acid compounds.               The
neutral ethers are obtained either by the action of chloride of
terephthalyle on the alcohols, or by means of the iodide of the alco
hol radicals and terephthalate of silver or of potassium.
    The methyl-terephthalic ether, C8 H‘ (CII")‘2 O‘, is the most cha
racteristic compound, and consequently may be used to detect the
existence of terephthalic acid in the presence of other acids.              It
forms beautiful <U+FB02>at prismatic crystals several inches long, which fuse
at a temperature above 100° (Cent.), and sublime without decom
   osition.   It is readily soluble in warm alcohol, and slightly soluble
in cold alcohol.
    The ethyl-terephthalic-ether forms long prismatic crystals resem
bling urea, and is readily soluble in cold alcohol.
    The amyl-terephthalic-ether forms scaly crystals of pearly lustre,
is readily soluble in alcohol, and fuses in the temperature of the hand.
    Phenyl-terephthalic-ether, a white crystalline substance, fuses at

    The acid compounds         are generally formed in small quantities,
along    with  the  neutral   ethers,   by the action of the iodide of the
alcohol radicals on terephthalate of silver.           They are well-de<U+FB01>ned
monobasic acids, and form crystallizable substances soluble in alcohol.
    N itro-terephthalic acid, C" H“ (N02) 0‘. This acid is formed by
acting with a mixture of nitric and fuming sulphuric acid on tere
phthalic acid. When crystallized from certain solvents, it forms well
developed prismatic crystals of a faint yellow colour.           From water,
it deposits in cauli<U+FB02>ower-like aggregations.
    Nitro-terephthalic acid is readily soluble in warm alcohol and in

544                          Royal Society    :—
warm water, and possesses the bibasic character of the terephthalic
acid in a much higher degree.          It forms well-de<U+FB01>ned crystallizable
acid and neutral salts.      The ethers of this acid are likewise crystal
lizable. They differ, however, from the terephthalic acid ethers by
their greater solubility in alcohol and their depressed fusing-point.
    Chloride of terephthaler (C’ H‘ 0‘1 Cl“) is obtained, together with
oxychloride of phosphorus (hydrochloric acid being evolved), when
terephthalic acid is acted upon with pentachloride of phosphorus at a
temperature of 40° (Cent.). Chloride of terephthaler is a solid and
beautifully crystalline substance, without odour at the ordinary
temperature, but evolving, when heated, at very pungent smell like
that of chloride of benzoyle, which it resembles in all its reactions._
\Vith the alcohols it forms terephthalic ethcrs, with ammonia an
amide, and with the organic bases compound amides.           Terephthalyl
amide, C" H” N’ O”, can only be obtained by acting with chloride of
terephthalyle on ammonia; it is a white amorphous substance in
soluble in all solvents.     Terephthalylamide, when treated with fum
ing nitric acid, yields nitro-terephthalic amide, Cl 11" (N02) N2 0’,
which crystallizes in beautiful prisms.
    Terephthalamide shows a remarkable resemblance to benzamide
when treated with substances capable of abstracting the elements of
water. It loses two equivalents of water (H2 O), and is converted
into terephthalylnitrile, CSII‘N’. This remarkable substance is best
 formed by the action of anhydrous phosphoric acid on terephthalamide.
 It distils over in form of a liquid, which solidi<U+FB01>es in the neck of the
retort.
    Terephthalylnitrile    is colourless   and without odour, and forms
beautiful prismatic crystals. It is insoluble in water, readily soluble
in boiling alcohol, less soluble in cold alcohol, and insoluble in benzole.
 When boiled with caustic alkalies, it is gradually decomposed,
 ammonia is given off, and terephthalic acid is reproduced.
    It is obvious that terephthalylnitrile, like all similar substances,
may be considered as a cyanogen compound, which in this instance
 would be the cyanide of the bibasic radical phenylene, C6 H‘, which is
not yet discovered.      If we could succeed in obtaining phenylene, the
 arti<U+FB01>cial production of terephthalic acid or an isomeric would probably
be attended with little dif<U+FB01>culty.
    By acting on nitro-terephthalic acid with reducing agents, it
 undergoes the same change as other nitro-compounds.            The product
 of this reaction is the oxy-terephthalamic acid, orthe analogue of the
 glycocoll of the formula C" H7 NO‘. This new member of the glyco
 colls is a lemon-yellow substance, crystallizing in thin prismatic, and
 sometimes     moss-like forms.       It is very slightly soluble in cold
 water, alcohol, ether, and chloroform.        Like other substances of this
 kind, terephthal-glycocoll combines with bases as well as with acids.
 The salts formed with the bases are crystalline; they are readily
 soluble in water and dilute alcohol, yielding colourless solutions of
most remarkable fluorescent properties, which have been investigated
by Professor Stokes.
    The aqueous and alcoholic solution of the pure terephthalic glycocoll

On    the  Electric Conducting Power of Cop'oer and its Alloys.         545
shows the same properties.           The compounds with acids crystallize
well, and if dissolved in a large quantity of water decompose.         They
do not possess the <U+FB02>uorescence when in their acid solution.
    The ether-like com pounds of oxy-terephthalamic acid are obtained
by acting upon the corresponding ethers of the nitro-terephthalic
acid with reducing agents.          The methylic other is a beautiful cry
stalline substance, readily soluble in warm alcohol, but much less
soluble in any of the solvents than nitro-terephthalate of methyle.
The ethylic ether'crystallizes in large crystals with an appearance
resembling those of nitrate of uranium.         The solutions of this ether
possess the <U+FB02>uorescent property in the highest degree.            Oxy-tere
phthalamate of methylc and ethyle combine with acids and form well
de<U+FB01>ned salts.        Oxy-terephthalamic acid, as well as its ether, are
readily acted upon by nitrous acid, this reaction giving rise to a
number of new derivatives, which vary in their nature according to
the condition in which the reaction takes place.
    M. Griess has lately made us acquainted with a new class of
remarkable substances which are obtained by the action of nitrous
acid on a certain class of nitrogenous bodies.       The several derivatives
 he obtained by     this reaction from  oxy-benzamic acid have their repre
sentatives    in the bibasic tcrephthalyle series, and are obtained with the
utmost facility.     On  acting with nitrous acid upon an aqueous solution
 of  the  oxy-terephthalamic acid instead of an alcoholic solution, as is
 employed in Griess’s reaction, this substance is readily decomposed,
 nitrogen is given off in large. quantities, and there gradually separates
 a whitish substance which is oxy-terephthalic acid, C" 11" O".         This
 acid is a substance of great interest, and its preparation offering much
 less dif<U+FB01>culty than the analogous oxy-aeids of the aromatic series, it
 affords an opportunity of studying to a fuller extent the nature of this
 class of acids, especially as it may be expected that the history of this
 acid will throw some light on the law of polybasicity.            Oxy-tere
 phthalic acid forms beautiful crystalline salts, which are less soluble
 than the corresponding terephthalates. The neutral ethers are liquid.
    The chloride of oxy-terepbthalyle is likewise a liquid readily decom
 posed by water and alcohols.

    All the        above wires were              hard-drawn.          On looking at the above,
we <U+FB01>nd that pure copper                    conducts      better     tlmn    any of the alloys.
    With regard               to   the   analyses,     the                  of  each specimen was
so small        that       they    could    not    be  chec  q‘pantity
                                                               'ed   by repetition; they, how
ever, approach very closely                     to  the composition assigned to them by
 Messrs. Johnson and Matthey (with the exception of the suboxide).
The traces of iron will be due to the draw-plates.                                 I will now make
a few remarks               on  the   above      results.
    I. That copper containing 0'25 per cent. of silver conducts better
than that with 0'13 per cent., may be explained by assuming that the
<U+FB01>rst contains less snboxide than the second; for it is very possible
that copper containing silver will not absorb suboxide so readily as
 the purer metal. It must also be borne in mind that the copper em
ployed for making these alloys was in all probability simply electro
type copper (not fused), and that the suboxide therefore was ab
sorbed during the process of fusing the two metals together. This
assumption explains how it is that the alloys contain almost the same
amount of impurity as was originally alloyed with the copper; for
bad the copper em loyed contained suboxide, we should have ex
pected to have foun greater differences in the cases of the tin, lead,
and zinc alloys, as some portion of those metals would have been ox
idized at the expense of part of the suboxide of copper, and escaped
as oxide to the surface of the melted metal.
    II. That copper containing 0'25 per cent. tin conducts better
than that containing 0'13 per cent., may also be explained by
assuming that they absorbed different amounts of suboxide during
the process of fusion; for although tin, in presence of suboxide of
copper, would be oxidized, yet copper retains the suboxide so
tenaciously, that portions will always remain with the copper.
    III.    The fact that the conducting powers of the alloy of copper

548                          Royal Socier        :—
containing 0'25 per cent. lead approaches the nearest of those which
I analysed to that of pure copper,    is,  in my opinion,   proof that the
                                                                    a
alloy is probably a  mechanical mixture of copper, traces of lead, and
enough suboxide to allow its being drawn into wire, and not solution     a
of lead in copper otherwise much lower conducting power ought to
                 ;               a
have been found; for, according to my own experiments,            requires
                                                                         it
twice as many volumes per cent. of lead as of tin to reduce (within
certain limits) the conducting power of           metal (bismuth, silver,
                                                  a
&c., and copper, for   itbelongs to the same class) to the same value:
thus, to reduce the conducting power of silver to 67,       would require
                                                                    it
0'9 volume per cent. of lead, or about 0'4 volume per cent. of tin;
to reduce  it  to 47-6, it would require 1'4 volume per cent. of lead,
or 0'7 volume per cent. of tin, &c. (Phil. Trans. 1860).        Dr. 11011.
mann and myself repeatedly tried to draw pure cop er alloyed with
0'25 of lead without success     ; the alloy was perfect rotten, which
                                                                    y
also seems to indicate  a  mechanical mixture.
   1V. It  is curious that the zinc alloys contained no suboxide.
   The reason, therefore, of the difference in our results          simplyis
that Messrs. Johnson and Matthey did not use those precautions in
fusing their copper and its alloys which are necessary to ensure good
results for bad they taken those precautions to prevent the absorp
      ;
tion of oxygen by their copper and its alloys which Dr. Holzmann
and myself did, and which are fully described in our paper on the
subject (Phil. Trans. 1860), the lead-copper alloys which they sup
plied to Prof. Thomson would not have been superior in conductive
quality to the unalloyed electrotype copper; and he would have
been led to the same conclusion as that which Dr. Holzmann and
myself arrived at, namely, that there are no alloys of copper which
conduct better than pure copper. Professor Thomson, in his paper,
states thatit  ishis opinion that the differences be observed in the
conducting powers of his alloys must depend upon very small ad
mixtures of probably non-metallic impurities.          This conclusion         is
completely borne out        by
                            the above, as well as              by
                                                         the investigation
carried out by myself in conjunction with Dr. Holzmann.
   The results obtained by Prof. Thomson show the marked in<U+FB02>u
ence of traces of foreign metals on the conducting power of pure
copper,—which     is  fully con<U+FB01>rmed        inour research on the same
 nb'eet.    Professor Thomson’s best-conducting alloy has            much  a
hig   er conducting power     than   those  found     somebyexperimenters
for electrotype c0pper  ;  but   it must be remembered that in all pro
bability the copper had been previously fused, and therefore con
tained snboxide of copper. The fact that electrotype copper may be
drawn without having been previously fused is, believe, generally
                                                               I
not known  ;   Professor Buff of Giessen <U+FB01>rst drew my attention to it,
and stated that he always obtained high values for the conducting
powers of electrotype cepper when drawn without previous fusion.

                            President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read :—                      \
    “ On Combustion in Rare<U+FB01>ed Air.” By Dr. Edward Frankland,
F.R.S.
    In the autumn of      1859, whilst accompanying Dr. Tyndall to the
summit of Mont Blane, I undertook at his request some experiments
on the effect of atmospheric pressure upon the amount of combustible
matter consumed by a common candle.              I   found that, taking the
average of <U+FB01>ve experiments, a stearine candle diminished in weight
9'4 grammes when burnt for an hour at Chamounix; whilst its igni
tion for the same length of time on the summit of Mont Blanc,
perfectly protected from currents of air, reduced its weight to the
extent of 9'2 grammes.                                           .
    This close approximation to the former number under such a
widely different atmospheric pressure, goes far to prove that the
rate of combustion is entirely independent of the density of the at
mosphere.
    It is impossible to repeat these determinations in a satisfactory
manner with arti<U+FB01>cially rare<U+FB01>ed atmospheres, owing to the heating
of the apparatus which surrounds the candle, and the consequent
guttering and unequal combustion of the latter; but an experiment
in which a sperm candle was burnt <U+FB01>rst in air under a pressure of
28'? inches of mercury, and then in air at 9 inches pressure, other
conditions being as similar as possible in the two experiments, the
consumption of sperm was found to be,—
       At pressure of 28'7 inches 7'85 grms. of sperm per hour,
                ,,         9.0 I,      9.          I,       n
thus con<U+FB01>rming, for higher degrees of rarefaction, the result pre
viously obtained.
     In burning the candles upon the summit of Mont Blanc, was         I
much struck by the comparatively small amount of light which they
emitted.     The lower and blue portion of the <U+FB02>ame, which under
ordinary circumstances scarcely rises to within a quarter of an inch
of the apex of the wick, now extended to the height of %th of an inch
 above the cotton, thus greatly reducing the size of the luminous
 portion of the <U+FB02>ame.
     On returning to England, I repeated the experiments under cir
 cumstances which enabled me to ascertain, by photometrical measure
 ments, the extent of this loss of illuminating effect in rare<U+FB01>ed air.
 The results prove that a great reduction in the illuminating power of
 a candle ensues when the candle is transferred from air at the ordi
 nary atmospheric pressure to rare<U+FB01>ed air. It was, however, found that,
 owing to the circumstances mentioned above, no satisfactory quan
 titative experiments could be made with candles in arti<U+FB01>cially rare<U+FB01>ed
 air, and recourse was therefore had to coal-gas, which, although also
 liable to certain disturbing in<U+FB02>uences, yet yielded results, during an ex
 tensive series of experiments, exhibiting suf<U+FB01>cient uniformity to render
 them worthy of con<U+FB01>dence.        The gas was in all cases passed through a
 governor   to   secure uniformity   of pressure in the delivery tubes. A
 single jet  of   gas was   employed as the standard of comparison, and

550                             Royal Society      :—
this was <U+FB01>xed at one end of a Bunsen's hotometer, whilst the <U+FB02>ame
to be submitted to various pressures, and) which             I  will call the expo
rimental <U+FB02>ame, was placed at the other. The experimental <U+FB02>ame
was made to burn a uniform amount of gas, viz. 0'65 cubic foot
per hour in all the experiments.
    The products of combustion were com letely removed, so that
the experimental <U+FB02>ame, which burnt witli perfect steadiness, was
always surrounded with pure air, the supply of which was, however,
so regulated as to secure a maximum of illuminating effect in each
observation.
    In all the following series of experiments, the illuminating power
given under each pressure is the average of twenty observations,
which accord with each other very closely. In each series, the
maximum illuminating clieet, that is the light given by the expe
rimental <U+FB02>ame when burning under the full atmospheric pressure,
is assumed to be 100.          The following is a summary of the results :—

    These numbers indicate that even the natural oscillations of atmo
 spheric pressure must produce a considerable variation in the amount
 of light emitted by gas-<U+FB02>ames, and it was therefore important to
 determine, by a special series of observations, this variation in lu
 minosity within, or nearly within, the usual <U+FB02>uctuations of the
 barometrical column.          In order to attain greater delicacy in the
 pressure readings      in   these   experiments,     a water-gauge was used,
 but its indications are translated into inches of mercury in the
 following tabulated results, each of which represents, as before, the
 average of twenty observations.

   It is thus evident that the combustion of an amount of gas which
would give a light equal to 100 candles when the barometer stands
at 31 inches, would give a light equal to only 84'4 candles if the
barometer fell to 28 inches.
   An inspection of all the above results shows that the rarefaction
of air, from atmospheric pressure downwards, produces a uniformly
diminishing illuminating power until the pressure is reduced to about
 14 inches of mercury, below which the diminution of light proceeds
at a less rapid rate.        The above determinations give a proximately
5'1 per cent. as the mean reduction of light for each iminution of
 1 inch of mercurial         pressure down to 14 inches.                The followin
Table exhibits the actually observed light, compared with that
calculated from this constant.

           NOTE ON THE FREEZING OF SALINE SOLUTIONS.
                               BY M. RUDORFF.
               which contains saline substances in solutionI freezes, as
“TATER  is well  known, at a considerably lower temperature than pure
water, and in passing into the solid state carries with it only a very
small proportion of the dissolved salts.            M. Rudortf proposed
to investigate as large a number as possible of saline solutions. in
reference to these two phenomena,           and to ascertain if they were
not subject to de<U+FB01>nite laws.
    By experiments with solutions of common salt, of sulphate of
copper, and of bichromate of potash, he <U+FB01>rst ascertained that the pro
portion of salt in the ice formed is always far less than that in the
mother-liquor.      "he lamellar structure of the ice led him even to
think that the salt which it contained was merely mechanically
mixed, and that the ice, properly so called, was quite. pure.
    He then proceeded to a determination of the exact tempera
tures at which ice forms in dilferent solutions.       He prepared, with
each of the salts, a series of solutions containing respectively
 I, 2, 3 . . . . parts of salt to 100 of water. He placed each of
them successively in a mixture of snow and salt, and stirred it with
a thermometer which indicated twentieths of a degree Centigrade,
until it solidi<U+FB01>ed. Under these conditions, the freezing was sudden,
simultaneous throughout all the mass, and accompanied by a marked
increase of temperature.        After this <U+FB01>rst determination (which was
not entirely    accurate,   in consequence of the change in the composi
tion of the liquor resulting from the instantaneous formation of a
large quantity of ice) M. Rudortf made a second experiment, in
which, without stirring the solution, he cooled it to about half a
degree below the temperature at which the liquid froze in the pre
ceding experiment. He then projected a few <U+FB02>akes of snow into
the liquid, and observed that congelation took place accompanied by
a slight increase of temperature.      and he took the last indication of
the thermometer for the freezing-point of the solution investigated.
The formation of ice then continued for a long time without
change of temperature; and it was only after a considerable quan
tity of ice had been formed that cooling commenced.           If the solu.
tion was then taken out of the freezing-mixture and placed in a

room at a temperature of 12°, the thermometer rose to the tempera
ture of the freezing-point, and remained almost constant until the
whole of the ice was melted.
   The salts suitable for these experiments ought to be very soluble
at low temperatures, and to exert a marked influence on the freezing
point; they are hence few in number, and in fact are almost
con<U+FB01>ned to the alkaline chlorides and nitrates.      In most cases,
M. Rudor<U+FB01>' found that the lowering of the freezing-point below
zero was proportional to the quantity of anhydrous salt dissolved in
100 parts of water.    The following numbers give the lowering pro
duced by the addition of 1 part of salt to 100 parts of water :—

   For chloride of calcium, the lowering of temperature appeared to
be proportional to the quantity of salt crystallized with six equiva
lents of water, and not to the quantity of anhydrous salt which the
solution contains.   Designating by M the quantity of anhydrous
salt, by M1 the quantity of hydrated salt dissolved in 100 parts of

  At   a temperature of — 10°, crystals separate from     concentrated       a
solution of common salt, which contain four equivalents of water
for one of salt, and are rapidly destroyed by increase of temperature.
This circumstance explains         remarkable result following from
                                          a
M. Rudorff's experiments. So long as the lowering of the freez

proportional to the quantity of anhydrous salt dissolved. When                            it is

   EXPERIMENTS             ON SOME AMALGAMS.                                BY    J.    P. JOULE, LL.D.
   The    weakness of the af<U+FB01>nity which holds the constituents of amal
gams     in combination seemed to the author to offer the means of
 studying the relationship between chemical and mechanical force.
 His inquiries were extended to several amalgams, and gave results
of which the following            a summary.
                                       is
    Amalgam    of   iron   was    formed by precipitating iron on mercury
electrolytically.     The     solid amalgam containing the largest quantity
of mercury appeared        to  be a binary compound.       Iron does not appear
to  lose   any of its  magnetic      virtue  in consequence of its combination
with mercury.        Its amalgamation has the effect of making            nega                       it
tive with respect to iron in the electro-chemical series.           The a<U+FB01>'inity
between mercury and iron               so feeble that the amalgam
                                               is                       speedily                is
decomposed      when     left   undisturbed,    and almost immediately when
agitated. The application of pressure of <U+FB01>fty tons to the square
                                                    a
inch drives out so much mercury as to leave only 30 per cent. of                                             it
in the resulting button.
   Amalgamqf Copper.--By precipitating copper on mercury electro
lytically, a mass of crystals             gradually formed.
                                                    is          After a certain
time the crystals begin to get fringed with pink, indicating uncom
bined copper.       In this state the amalgam             found to be nearly is                               a
binary compound. On applying strong pressure to an amalgam con
taining excess of mercury, the latter               driven off. leaving
                                                                 is        hard                      a
mass composed of equivalents of the metals.                  however, the pres~   If,

                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous      Articles.          555
sure be continued for a long time, the resulting amalgam contains
more than one equivalent of copper, indicating a partial decom
position.
   The author gave an account of his experiments with amalgams of
silver, platinum, lead, zinc, and tin. In the case of the latter amal
gam, long-continued pressure drives off nearly the whole of the mer
cury, indicating in a striking manner the ef<U+FB01>cacy of mechanical
means to overcome feeble chemical af<U+FB01>nities—From the Proceedings

PRELIMINARY NOTE           ON THE PRODUCTION OF VIBRATIONS AND
    MUSICAL SOUNDS BY ELECTROLYSIS.                BY GEORGE GORE, ESQ.
    If a large quantity of electricity is made to pass through a suitable
good conducting electrolyte into a small surface of pure mercury,
and especially if the mercurial surface is in the form of a narrow
strip about gth of an inch wide, strong vibrations occur; and sym
metrical crispations of singular beauty, accompanied by de<U+FB01>nite
sounds, are produced at the mutual surfaces of the liquid metal 'and
electrolyte.
    In my experiments the erispations and sounds were readily pro
duced by taking a circular pool of mercury from I to 3 inehesin
diameter, surrounded by a ring of mercury about %th or TLJth of an
inch wide, both being contained in a circular vessel of glass or gutta
pereha, covering the liquid metal to a depth of about % an inch with
a rather strong aqueous solution of cyanide of potassium, connecting
the pool of mercury by a platinum wire with the positive pole of a
battery capable of forcing a rather large quantity of electricity through
the liquid, and connecting the ring of mercury with the negative pla
tinum wire. The ring of mercury immediately became covered with
erispations or elevated sharp ridges about gth of an inch asunder,
all radiating towards the centre of the vesse , and a de<U+FB01>nite or musical
sound was produced capable of being heard, on some occasions, at a
distance of about 40 or 50 feet.        The vibrations and sounds ceased
after a short time, but were always reproduced by reversing the
direction of the electric current for a short time, and then restoring
it to its original direction.       The loudness of the sound depends
greatly upon    the  power  of the  battery ; if the battery was too strong
the sounds did not occur.        The battery I have used consists of 10
pairs of Smee’s elements, each silver plate containing about 90 square
inches of immersed or acting surface; and I have used with equal
success six Grove’s batteries, arranged either as 2 or 3 pairs, each pla
tinum plate being 6 inches long and 4 inches wide. If the cyanide
solution was too strong, the sounds were altogether prevented.
    Being occupied in investigating the conditions and relations of this
phenomenon with the intention of submitting a complete account of
the results to the notice of the Royal Society, I refrain from stating
further particulars on the present occasion.—From the Proceedings
 of  the Royal   Society,  April  11, 1861.
