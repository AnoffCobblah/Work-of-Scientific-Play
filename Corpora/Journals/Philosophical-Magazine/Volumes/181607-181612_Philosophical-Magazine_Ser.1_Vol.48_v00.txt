I. Some      brief Particulars respecting the Strand or Waterloo
     Bridge, erected over the Thames, at the Savoy, London.
With        our present number we have given an engraving, by
Porter,   of this elegant and highly useful embellishment of the
metropolis*.      The foundation stone was laid on the 8th of Octo
ber 1811, and the ninth and last arch was finished on the 2Sth
of November 1815, having thus occupied very little more than
four years, a space during which no work of such magnitude was
ever known to have been executed in ancient or modern times.
Indeed many smaller works of the kind have been several vears
more in building.
    The superstructure only remains to be executed ; and when
the avenues on the north side from the Strand                   through the
Savoy, and on the south or Surrey side to the Obelisk in St.
 George's fields, are made, the bridge will be opened for car
riages and foot passengers promiscuously.                  This part of the
work, however,      will   require great     skill, and cannot  be executed
without a most serious expense : it will require much ingenuity,
for instance, to make the road on the Surrey side of the river, as
 it is intended, for the sake of          easy  ascent,  that the road shall
 pass over a series     of arches almost       as far as the Obelisk ; while
 on both   sides  of   the  river   the   compensations    demanded   of the
 Strand Bridge Company for the buildings necessary to be pulled
 down are enormous beyond all precedent.                Eight hundred thou
 sand pounds have been already expended, and the least cost of the
 completion of the design will be two hundred thousand pounds
 more, which we trust there will be no difficulty in raising.
     The whole structure is of beautiful Cornish granite, and the
 arch stones ure mostly from 5 to 7 tons in weight.              Blackfriars-
 bridge, as our readers already know, is of Portland stone; and it

is highly to the credit of the Strand or Waterloo Bridge Com
pany that they have adopted the former more durable material :
for, had mere profit been their object, the Portland stone would
 certainly have been preferred for its cheapness.
    We need scarcely add that this magnificent structure is a
theme of admiration for beauty of form and exquisite masonry to
 all persons of taste or skill in architecture. The celebrated Ca-
 r.ova in particular, when lately in London, pronounced it to t-e
 the grandest work of the kind in the world.
II.    The original Inhabitants of America shown to he of the same
      Family and Lineage with those of Asia; by a Process of
      reasoning not hitherto advanced.  By Samuel L. Mitchill,
      M.D.,   Professor   of Natural History in the University of
      New-York; in    a Communication to De Witt Clinton, P,sq.
      President of the New-York Philosophical Society, dated New-
      York, March 31, 1816*.
The     view which I took of the varieties of the human race, in
my course of Natural History, delivered in the University of New-
York, differs in so many particulars from that entertained by the
great zoologist of the age, that I give you for information, and
without delay, a summary of my yesterday's lecture to my class.
    I denied, in the beginning, the assertion that the American
aborigines were of a peculiar constitution, of a race svi generis,
and of a copper colour.     All these notions were treated as fanci
ful and visionary.
    The indigenes of the two Americas appear to me to be of the
same stock and genealogy with the inhabitants of northern and
southern Asia.     The northern tribes were probably more hardy,
ferocious and warlike, than those of the south.        The tribes of
the lower latitudes seem to have been greater proficients in the
arts, particularly of making clothes, clearing the ground, and
erecting works of defence.
    The parallel between the people of America and Asia affords
this important conclusion, that on both continents the hordes
dwelling in the higher latitudes have overpowered the more ci
vilized, though feebler inhabitants of the countries situated to
wards the equator. "As the Tartars have overrun China, so the
Aztecas subdued Mexico.        As the Huns and Alans desolated
Italy, so the Chipewas and Iroquois prostrated the populous set
tlements on both banks of the Ohio.
    The surviving race in these terrible conflicts between the dif
ferent nations of the ancient native residents of North America,

                                                                  is

         Identity  of Race in the American and Asiatic      Man.      5
 is  evidently that of the Tartars.    This opinion   is founded upon
 four .considerations.
     1.  The similarity of physiognomy and features.        His excel
 lency   M. Genet, late minister- plenipotentiary from France to the
 United States, is w"il acquainted with the faces, hues and figures
of our Indians and of the Asiatic Tartars ; and is perfectly satis
fied    of their  mutual  resemblance.    Mons. Cazeaux,     consul of
France to     New-York, has drawn the       same   conclusion from a
careful    examination   of the native man of North America and
 Northern Asia.
    Mr. Smibert, who had been employed, as Josiah Meigs, esq.
now commissioner of the land office of the United States relates,
in executing paintings      of Tartar visages, for the grand duke of
Tuscany, was so struck with the similarity of their features, to
those of the Naraganset Indians, that he pronounces them mem
bers of the same great family of mankind.       The anecdote is pre
served, with all its circumstances, in the fourteenth volume of
the   Medical Repository.
    Within a few months I examined over and again             seven or
tight Chinese sailors, who had assisted in navigating a ship from
Macao to New- York.         The thinness of their beards, the bay
complexion, the black lank hair, the aspect of the eyes, the con
tour of the face, and in short the general external character,
induced every person who observed them, to remark how nearly
they resembled the Mohegans and Oneidas of New-York.
    Sidi Mellimelli, the Tunisian envoy to the United States in
 1804, entertained the same opinion, on beholding the Cherokees,
Osages, and Miamics, assembled at* the city of Washington du
ring his residence there.     Their Tartaf physiognomy struck him
in a moment.
    2. The affinity of their languages.    The late learned and en
terprising Professor Barton took the lead in this curious inquiry.
He collected as many words as he could from the languages
spoken in Asia and America ; and he concluded, from the nu
merous coincidences of sound and signification, that there must
have been a common origin.
    3. The existence of corresponding customs.         I mean at pre
sent to state that of shaving away the hair of the scalp, from the
fore part and sides of the head, so that nothing is left but a tuft
or lock on the crown.
    The custom of smoking the pipe, on solemn occasions, to the
four cardinal points of the compass, to the heavens and to the
earth, is reported, upon the most credible authority, to distinguish
equally the hordes of the Asiatic. Tartars and the bands of the
American Siaux.
                                   A 3                          4. The

6      Identity of Race in  the American and Asiatic    Man.
   4. The kindred nature of the Indian dogs of America and the
Siberian dogs of Asia.
   The animal that 'ivcs with the natives of the two continents,
as a dog, is very different from the tame and familiar creature of
the same name in Europe.       He is either a different species, or
a wide variety of the same species.        Rut the identity of the
American and Asiatic curs is evinced by several considerations.
Both are mostly white.      They have shaggy coats, sharp noses
and erect ears.    They are voracious, thievish, and to a consi
derable degree indomitable.      They steal whenever they can, and
sometimes turn against their masters.       They are prone to snarl
and grin, and they have a howl instead of barking. . They are
employed in both hemispheres for labour: such as carrying bur
thens, drawing sleds over the snow, and the like: being yoked
and harnessed for the purpose, like horses.
   This coincidence of our Indian dog with the Canis Sibericus
is a very important fact.    The dog, the companion, the friend or
 the slave of man in all his fortunes and migrations, thus reflects
great light upon the history of nations and of their genealogy.
    II. The exterminated race in the savage encounters between
the nations of North America in ancient days appears clearly to
have been that of the Malays.
   The bodies and shrouds and clothing of these individuals have
within a few years been discovered in the caverns of saltpetre and
copperas within the states of Kentucky and Tennesee : their entire
and exsiccated condition has led intelligent gentlemen who have
seen them to call them mummies.         They are some of the most
memorable of the antiquities that North America contains.       The
race or nation to which they belonged is extinct ; but in pre
ceding ages occupied the region situated between lakes Ontario
and Erie on the north and the gulf of Mexico on the south, and
bounded eastwardly by the Alleghany mountains, and westwardly
 by the Mississippi river.
    That they were similar in their origin and character to the
present inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and of Austral Asia,
is argued from various circumstances.
    1. The sameness of texture in the plain cloth or matting that
enwraps the mummies, and that which our navigators bring from
Wakash, the Sandwich Islands, and the Fegees.
   2. The close resemblance there is between the feathery man
tles brought nowadays from the islands of the South Sea, and
those wrappers which surround the mummies lately disinterred
in the western states. The plumes of birds are twisted or tied
to the threads, with peculiar skill, and turn water like the back
of a duck.
                                                         3. Meshes

           Identity of Race in    the American and Asiatic   Man.        7
       3. Meshes of nets regularly knotted and tied, and formed of
  a   strong and even twine.
       4. Moekasons or coverings for the feet, manufactured with
  remarkable ability, from the bark or rind of plants, worked into
  a sort of stout matting.
      5. Pieces of antique sculpture, especially of human heads and
  of some other forms, found where the exterminated tribes had
  dwelt, resembling the carving at Otaheite, New Zealand, and
  other places.
      6. Works of defence, or fortifications, overspreading the fer
  tile tract of country formerly possessed by these people, who
  may be supposed capable of constructing woiks of much greater
  simplicity than the morais or burial-places,       ar.d the hippas or
 fighting-stages of the Society Islands.
      7. As far as observations have gone, a belief that the shape of
 the skull and the angle of the face in the mummies correspond
 with those of the living Malays.
      I reject therefore the doctrine taught by the European na
 turalists, that the man of Western America differs in any ma
 terial point from the man of Eastern Asia.        Had the Robertsons,
 the Buffons, the Ravnals, the De Pautvs, and the other sps emula
 tors upon the American character and the vilifiers of the Ameri
 can name, procured         the requisite information concerning the
 hemisphere" situated to the west of us, they would have disco
 vered that the inhabitants of vast legions of Asia, to the number
 of many millions, were of the same blood and lineage with the
 undervalued and despised population of America.            The learned
 Dr. Williamson has discussed this point with great ability.
      1 forbore   to go furl tier than to ascertain bv the correspon
 dences already stated, the identity of origin and derivation to the
 American and Asiatic natives.         1 avoided the opportunity   which
 this grand conclusion afforded me, of stating that America was
 the cradle of the human race; of tracing its colonies westward
 over the Pacific Ocean, and beyond the se.t of Kamschatka,            to
 new settlements;     of following the emigrants by land and by wa
 ter, until they reached Europe and Africa ; and lastly,          of fol
 lowing adventurers from the former of these sections ot the globe
 to the plantations and abodes which they found and occuped in
America.        I had no inclination to oppose the current opinions
relative to the place of man's creation and dispersion.        I thought
it was scarcely worth the while to inform an European, thv.'. on
coming to America, he had left the new world behind him for
the purpose of visiting the Old.,         It ought, nevertheless, to be
 remarked, that     there are    many important advantages derived to
 our reasoning from the present manner of considering           the sub
ject.      The principles    being now established, they will be sup-

ported by a further induction of facts and occurrences, to an ex
tent and an amount that it is impossible, at this moment, fairly
to estimate.     And the conclusions of Jefferson, Lafon, and others
favourable to the greater antiquity of American population, will
be daily reinforced and confirmed.
    Having thus given the history of these races of man, spreading
so extensively over the globe, I considered the human family un
der three divisions :
    First, the Tawsy man, comprehending the Tartars, Malays,
 Chinese, the American Indians of every tribe, Lascars, and other
people of the same cast and breed.        From these seemed to have
 proceeded two remarkable varieties ; to wit,
    Secondly, the White man, inhabiting naturally the countries
in Asia and Europe situated north of the Mediterranean Sea ;
 and, in the course of his adventures, settling all over the world.
Among these I reckon the Greenlanders and Esquimaux.
    Thirdly, the Black man, whose proper residence is in the re
gions south of the Mediterranean, particularly toward the interior
 of Africa. The people of Papua and Van Diemen's Land seem
 to be of this class.
     It is generally supposed, and by many able and ingenious men
 too, that external physical causes, and the combination of cir
 cumstances which they call climate, have wrought all these
 changes in the human form.        I do not, however, think them ca
 pable of explaining the differences which exist among the nations.
 There is an internal physical cause of the greatest moment, which
 has scarcely been mentioned.        This is the generative influence.
 If by the act of modelling the constitution in the embryo and
 foetus, a predisposition to gout, madness, scrofula, and consump
 tion, may be engendered, we may rationally conclude, with the
 sagacious D'Azara, that the procreative power may also shape
 the features, tinge the skin, and give other peculiarities to man.

      F.L.S.f in company with the Hon.        J. J. PiiRCiVAL and  Mr.
      Parker, in 181b'.
     April   26, 1816. — Fine spring morning, but no leaves out
  yet.    Features of sondercloud and stackeucloud.       We left Edin
  burgh in the evening, and proceeded to
      Linlithgow. Fine still evening. The jackdaws flying round
  in large flocks, and very clamorous about the ruins of the old
                                                                 abbey.

abbey.    The lower atmosphere was       clamp and hazy.      Swallow
 (Hirundo rustica) first seen, and the bat seen.
    April 27.— We left Linlithgow at 5 A.M. Fair morning and
warm, with cnrlcloud, and some stackenclouds, &c.           I had oc
casion to notice a large number of swallows from the tower of
Doon Castle.       We arrived to dinner at Cullender in the High
lands.    I noticed in the evening, after a fair day, that the cumuli
which had previously only lodged on the mountain tops, de
scended lower and lower, till I saw them dissolve into fallcloud,
or fog, and fill the valleys.   I never had an opportunity of seeing
this process so perfect before.     The squalling of the peacocks in
the evening, and the increase of clouds aloft, indicate rain.     Ben
Leddi is still covered at the top with snow, and few trees have
any appearance of verdure yet.         There is a striking similarity
between the general face of the country here and that of part ot
Merionethshire and other parts of North Wales.          There is said
to be a great resemblance between the inhabitants of mountainous
countries, but I observe a striking difference between the High
land Scotch and the North Welch.          The former have a greater
disposition to acquire knowledge, but are more circumspect, and
not of so warm a disposition in general.
    April 28. — Cumuli creeping up the hills. They were capped
with clouds all the way we travelled by Loch Ern to Crieff.
Some of these clouds however were higher, and there were fea
tures of sondercloud and curlcloud higher up.         The manners of
the people change very much as one advances from the capital
towards the Highlands.        The-dress too of the Highlanders, with
their plaids and kilts.       The style of building of the old towns
resembles somewhat that of the old towns on the French coast.
We saw water-dorkers about the lakes ; also the water-ouzel.
    April 29. — Clouds on' the hills ; and then continued showers
of gentle rain.     We proceeded to Perth — Here again the man
tes of the people are more anglicized. The twainclouds and
rainclouds rested on hills not more than 1000 feet high, which
is very low for these clouds.
    April HO. — Leaving Perth early, I noticed the lowuess of the
clouds.     Their height cannot be so well found in a flat country,
as here where they are seen interposed between hills of known
height.     The rainclouds or nimbi sweeping the sides of the hills
through the valleys often did not condense into drops of water,
till within 2 or 300 feet of the ground.     We passed through Dun-
keld and Cupar of Angus, and slept at Forfar. The afternoon was
very rainy.      We observed abundance of gulls, particularly the
black- headed gull on the ploughed grounds near Cupar.           I saw
the martin, for the first time this year, flying over the Tay by
 Dunkeld's bridge.
                                                                  May  ,

       May    1. — Clouded    morning' with a mist.       I noticed to-day
   between Laurencekirk and Aberdeen a curious phenomenon, not
  very common in England.             The cumuli in many places rolled
   along    with their bases  on  the flat ground, involving us occasion
   ally  in obscurity,  and  there  being to all appearance a fog, but in
   the profile at a distance I saw their cumulated forms.          I noticed
  also the vapour condensed in many places about a foot from
  ploughed ground, so as to appear like little strati or fallclouds,
  forming here' and there close to the earth.              I should observe
  that the cumuli touching the ground were going into the nimbi-
  form state, and that others at some distance were actually con
  densing into small rain a few feet from the ground.             When we
  got to Aberdeen a white and wet mist was involving the whole
  town and its neighbourhood.           In the fine intervals by day, the
  different modifications were seen in very indistinct features.
      May 2. — Fine spring morning, but no leaves on the trees yet.
  Light gales. Cumuli and the lighter modifications higher up.
      We left Aberdeen, and passing through Ellon came into Peter
  head at night.       Fleecy cumuli evaporating, and the new moon
  seen at intervals'.    In passing along we saw various kinds of gulls
  and the heron flying after sunset. Among other birds I saw the
  curlew (Scolopax arcuata) flying over the town of Ellon.
      May 3. — Left Peterhead again almost immediatelv after taking
 refreshment, about one in the morning, and passing through Cul-i
 len, Fochabers, Elgin, Ferres and Nairne, arrived at Inverness
 late at night       The country through which we passed was bar
 ren, except a few large plantations of pines and firs.                  The
 weather was showery with wind, and the air cool, with not the
 least appearance of spring. The inhabitants of the towns through
 which we passed were very different in appearance from the High
 landers.      On inquiring at the different booksellers in our route,
 what works on the subject of meteorology were known here, I
found that the works of Professors Leslie* and Jamiesonf were
the only Scotch works, relating to this science, known in this
part of the country.
      May 4. — Fair with various clouds; much arioslralus or
wanecloud in a lofty region towards night.
      May 5. — (At Inverness. )-^-I had an opportunity this morning
of observing the formation of matutine cumuli or stackenclonds
in the convalleys of the mountains, at a time when others in a
higher region were producing rainclouds by inosculation.              These

little cumuli formed in the vallevs had the hills for a background,
and were very    distinctly seen. They manifested the same pro
cess as cumuli   which form high up over flat countries ; many
small ones being lost as if by evaporation, while the larger were
increased and crept up the hills and got aloft.      Gentle rain came
on in light showers, with warm air.         The spring begins to ap
pear. The distances were clear, and I could distinctly ken Fort
George as I crossed the water into Ross-shire.           By comparing
the account of persons with whom I have conversed, I notice
the average temperature is greater here than at Aberdeen.
    May 6. — I noticed some nascent cumuli on the hills, the
upper atmosphere being also thickly clouded.           In general, to
day, the clouds were higher.
    We travelled along the western margin of Loch Ness' to
    Fort Augustus. — Showers came on in the evening, but I
observed that the streams of rain were formed higher up in the
air than was the case yesterday morning.          Walking out among
the mountains at night after the rain, I heard the shrill cry of
some waterfowl near the loch.          The heron was sailing leisurely
over the loch as we passed along this evening, not far from the
Castle of Urquhart, whose ruined towers are mouldering away
by degrees, and their stones rolling down the precipices into the
loch below.
    May 7. — Proceeded to Fort William^ I had occasion to
observe a range of cumuli (approaching in nature to cumulo-
atratus) in the valleys below Ben Nevis, and the contiguous
mountains extending irregularly upwards.           Some portions were
detached, and went up the sides of the mountain.            Higher up
were cumuli of more scudlike and nimbiform texture ; during
this time it was rainimr, a circumstance which enabled me to
see the formation of those nascent cumuli which feed showers
from below during the actual falling of rain.         Viewed with the
high hills of Ben Nevis and its range of mountains behind thern
as a background,      I could distinctly see and compare the dif
ference in colour and density of these clouds and nimbiforrn
clouds higher up.       I noticed too that certain flocculous masses
of thin clouds apparently evaporated, and the greater masses in-r
creased, while some portions seemed attached to the tops of the
hills, which were comparatively clear.           In the evening while
rowing on the water, I saw the clouds rolling along much below
very low hills, while others which sat upon higher ones had fine
cumuloi,"? tops, and a nimbiform or dense wanecloud much higher
up moved oiF with the direction of the wind and left a dingy
horizon at sunset.        I found ascending to the top of Ben Nevis
quite impossible from the depth of snow.           Herring gulls flying
in flocks about the water,         Air mi\i. Spring advancing.       By

  12               Noles of    a meteorological   Tour.
 night the sky was clouded with large clouds in different altitude*.
 I had to day a fine opportunity of confirming, by processes I saw
 going on about the mountains, the opinion I have long had of
 the electrical agency concerned in producing the forms of clouds,
 of which I shall treat more largely elsewhere.
     May 8. — Left Fort William early, and crossing the ferry,
 proceeded through Glenco to Tyndarum.                The clouds still on
 the hills, and gentle showers in the morning.              I observed to
 day one of the peaked mountains of Argyle'shirc involved about
 its base in small rain, while its pointed summit was capped with
 the raincloud in a less watery state.           What struck me as re
 markable was this. that the cloud did not terminate in rain by
 degrees, but there seemed a distinct boundary between the cloud
 at the top, and the rain surrounding its lower part and descend
ing to the ground.          In the evening most of the clouds were
 much higher, and the air got sharper.             I met Hogg the Etick
 shepherd and poet at a small public-house near the glen.
     May 9. — We proceeded to Stirling by way of Callender ; the
 weather cold, cloudy, and windy.
     May 10. — Returned to Edinburgh. Cold, windy, and cloudy
 day.
     May   11. — (At    Edinburgh.)      The weather still bearing the
 character of winter.        Hard showers of snow., hail and sleet, with,
 fair intervals.     The frondescence is very little advanced yet ; and
 an Englishman would suppose it March instead of May.
     May 12. — Fair day, with common dayclouds, and some fea
 tures of the light modification,         particularly the cirrus in the
morning.       The    air warmer    than yesterday.     The swallows are
by no means common yet, only a few stragglers here and there.
     May 13. — Lett Edinburgh, and came at night to Jedburgh,
by way of Melrose. Fair morning, and clouds high ; cold night.
    May 14. — I proceeded to Carlisle; the weather cold in the
shade, with fine diurnal stackenclouds.           I saw the Hirundo ur-
bica at Jedburgh abbey, and first saw and heard Hirundines
apodes    at the same place.
    May    15. — I proceeded by Keswick to Ambleside*.                 Fair
morning with much waneclouds ; in the evening rain among the
mountains all the way along Uiswater to Ambleside.               I noticed
among    other   things,  that  being high on the hill there was no rain,
but only a thick mist, or cloud scarcely wetting me. As I got lower
down the mist became small drops of rain, producing however
the obscurity of fog ; and when I got to the valleys below it was
become regular rain in streams.           The watery particles seem to
collect into larger and larger rainstreams in descending.
   * Perhaps the best drawn clouds of any    I have seen, were those shown
to me by Mr. Greene, an artist of Ambleside.
                                                                     May

    May   16. — Dr. Spurzheim    joined   me   at  Ambleside.      The
morning was warm, and the spring advancing rapidly. Towards
three in the afternoon rain came on in continued showers, and
lasted all the evening.    Gusts of wind at night.
   May 17. — Walked from Ambleside in Westmoreland            to Kes^>
wick in Cumberland.       Chiefly cloudy.    Helvellyn   was    cloud-
capped all the morning ; and at length the cloud hanging over
its sides seemed to descend in rain, whose streams acquired pro
gressive magnitude 'in xdescending.      In the evening I noticed
the clouds getting higher.    There arose also clouds in the valleys
and from the sides of the hills which crept up them and passed
off in the form of cumuli ef the floccose kind.         In the same
manner the nourishing cumuli of showers form and feed them
from below.     I had thus an opportunity of observing distinctly
the formation of cumuli in the eventide, and of their rising up
wards, as an indication of the fine weather of the following day.
   May 18. (At Keswick.) — Early in the morning high masses
of cloud showed a sondercloudiness of form ; a fine day with
light cumuli followed and some small evaporating cirri.            To
wards evening the cumuli enlarged, with continuous common
bases, and obscured the top of Skiddaw.         I noticed several of
the green cormorants and wild ducks while I rowed on the lake
called Derwentwater.
   May 19. Sunday.                       —
                           (At Keswick.) A fine day, we ascended
the mountain Skiddaw ; on the summit whereof the cumuli
lodged.    In the evening the clouds were high, but in greater
quantity.     When on Skiddaw in the morning, I noticed cirro-
stratus in the distance at nearly the same altitude as we were ;
but it was hanging over level grounds. I also observed that when
the cumuli got a continuity of base with greater density, be
coming cuinttlostratus they lodged on the mountains; but after
wards simple cumuli became ragged and descended down by the
sides of the mountain in particular places.
   May 20. -Proceeded to Penrith in the afternoon, after sailing
on the lake.    Clear day, cold in the wind, and hot in the sun,
with cumuli and light clouds in general.
   May 21. — I came to Manchester by Kendal. Fine morning
and cloudy night, with some rain.
   May 22. (At Manchester.) — Dry dusty clear day; cirro-

       June 1. — Left Bath and returned to Clapton. Fine warm
  spring day, the morning was particularly clear.
  IV. Some Observations and Experiments made                    on the Torpedo
      of  the Cape of Good Hope in the Year 1S12.                     By John
       T. Todd, late Surgeon of His Majesty's Ship Lion. Com
      municated by Sir Everard Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.*
   W hilst the Lion was stationed at the Cape of Good Hope,
  the seine, as is the custom throughout the navy, was frequently
  employed in procuring fish for the use of the ship's company,
  and besides the more edible kinds, many of the torpedo were
  caught.      In this manner the opportunity was afforded me of
 making the following observations, some of the imperfections of
  which I must be ailowed to attribute to the " manus nuda" of
 my situation.        The fit,h were generally caught early in the
  morning,     and   examined     as soon after as possible.         VVhen this,
 could -not be done, they         were    placed in buckets of sea-water,
 where they sometimes remained alive for three, and in one in
 stance for five days.
     The torpedo is seldom met with to the eastward of the Cape
 of Good Hope. Hence, whilst I rarely failed in procuring them
in Table Bay, I never but once succeeded in doing so in Simon's
 Bay, although the opportunities were the same in both places.
 It was never caught but by the seine, although the hook and
line, with bait of every variety, were as often made use of exactly
in the same situations.         It differs in no respect, as far as 1 have
been able to observe, from the same fish of the northern hemi
sphere, except that it was never found so large ; being never
more than eight, nor less than five inches in length, and never
more than five, nor less than three inches and a half in breadth.
The colour of the animal is various ; the upper surface being gene
rally hazel grey, reddish brown, or purple ; the under surface
greyish white, yellowish white, or white with black patches.

              on the Torpedo  of the Cape  of Good Hdpe.             15
    The columns of the electrical organs were larger, and less nu-
 Berous in   proportion, than those described by Mr. Hunter, in
 the torpedo caught at La Rochelle.        When separate and unin
fluenced by external pressure, they appear to be of the form of
 cylinders, as is shown as nearly as possible by suspending them-
 by one of their extremities.      The different forms which they
exhibit in a horizontal section of the whole organ, are produced
by their unequal attachment to one another by the intermediate
 reticular substance.
    The electrical organs are so placed within the curvature of the
 s&milunar cartilages of the large lateral fins, as to be entirely
uuder the influence of the muscles, which are inserted into these
 cartilages.   So that in any lateral motions of these cartilages to
wards the trunk, or in any increase of curvature of these carti
lages, the electrical organs must be compressed.      There appears
also to be a muscular structure, which connects the anterior-
 part of these cartilages to a process projecting from the anterior
part of the cranium, the action of which must tend to increase
this effect.
    The inferior and posterior terminations of the small lateral
fins are  covered with laminae of osseous matter, which are en
veloped in the epidermis.
   A much Jarger proportion of nerves is supplied to the electrical
than to any other organs.       This has appeared to others so im
portant an observation, that it maybe repeated with propriety.
    The shocks received from the toipedos which I examined,
were never sensible above the shoulder, and seldom above the
elbow-joint.     The intensity of the shock bore no relation to the
size of the animal ^sensation being the only measure of intensity),
but an evident relation to the liveliness of the animal, and vice
 versa.   The shocks generally followed simple contact, or such
irritation as pressing, pricking or squeezing, sometimes imme
diately, and sometimes not until after frequent repetition.        Not
unfrequently, however, animals apparently perfectly vivacious
suffered this irritation without discharging any shock.          There
appeared no regularity of interval between the shocks.          Some
times they were so frequent as not to be counted ; at other times,
not more than one or two have been received from one animal ;
and, iu a few instances, it has been impossible by any irritation
to elicit shocks from some of them.       When caught by the hand,
they sometimes writhed and twisted about, endeavouring to ex
tricate themselves by muscular exertion, and did not, until they
found these means unavailing, discharge the shock.            In many
instances, however, they     had  recourse  to their electrical  power
immediately.
    The electrical discharge was, in general,    accompanied      by aa
                   v- "
                                                                evident

 Ifi                Observations     and Experiments
evident    muscular action.        This was marked by an apparent
swelling of   the  superior   surface  of the electrical organs, particu
larly towards the anterior part, opposite to the cranium, and
by a retraction of the eyes.          It was so evident, that when the
animal was held in the hand of aiioiher person, I was often able
to point out when he received the shock.              In this, however, I
was   also sometimes    deceived   ; and  I think I  have  received shocks
 (particularly when the animal has been debilitated, and the
shocks weak), without having been able to observe this muscular
action.
     Two of  these animals, as nearly alike in every circumstance as
possible,    being each placed in a separate bucket of sea-water,
from one of them frequent shocks were elicited by irritation, viz.
simple contact, or pricking, &c. ; the other was allowed to re
main undisturbed.          The former became languid, the intensity
of its shocks diminished, and it soon died; the last shocks being-
received in a continued succession, producing pricking sensations
never extending above the hand.              The latter continued viva
 cious,  and  lived  until  the third   day.   This experiment was fre
 quently repeated with the same results; and it might be observed,
 hi general, where there was no direct comparison made, that
 those which parted with the shocks most freely soonest became
 languid, and died ; and those which parted with them most re
 luctantly, lived the longest.
     Two torpedos being placed exactly in the same circumstances
 as the last mentioned, from one shocks were elicited until it be
 came debilitated.       It was then allowed to remain until the fol
 lowing day. When they were both examined, it was found that
 the animal from which no shocks had been previously received,
 discharged them very freely : but it was with the greatest diffi
 culty that they could be procured from the other.
     Having made an incision on each side of the cranium and gills
 of a lively torpedo, I pushed aside the electrical organs, so as to
 expose and divide their nerves.         The animal was then placed in
 a bucket of sea-water.        On examining it in about two hours af
 terwards, I found it impossible to elicit shocks from it by any
irritation ; but it seemed to possess as much activity and liveli
 ness as before, and lived as long as those animals from which
 shocks had not been received, and which had not undergone this
  change.
     Two of these animals being procured, the nerves of the elec
 trical organs of one of them were divided after the manner above
described.      They were placed each in separate buckets of sea-
water, and allowed to remain undisturbed.             This was performed
 in the morning, and when examined in the evening, it was im
 possible to distinguish between the liveliness or activity of either.

               on the Torpedo    of the Cape  of Good Hope.         17
    Of two of    these animals, the nerves of the electrical organs of
 ©tie  of them were divided.          Being placed each in separate
 buckets of sea-water, they were both irritated as nearly alike as
 possible.     From the perfect animal, shocks were received; t.fter
 frequent repetition it became weak, and incapable of discharging
 the shock, and soon died.        The last shocks were not percepti
 ble above the second joint of the thumb, and so weak its to re
 quire much attention to observe them.            From the other no
 shocks could be received ; it appeared as vivacious as before,
 and lived until the second day.        This experiment was frequently
 repeated with nearly the same results.
    The nerves of one electrical organ only being divided in a
lively torpedo, from which shocks had been previously received,
on irritating the animal it was still found capable of communi
cating the shock.        Whether there was any difference in the de
gree   of  intensity could not be distinctly observed.    One electri
cal organ being altogether removed, the animal still continued
capable of discharging the electrical shock.
    Having divided one; of the nerves of each electrical organ in a
 torpedo, from which shocks had been previously received, I still
found the animal capable, after this change, of communicating
 the shock.
    Having introduced a wire through the cranium of a torpedo,
 which had been communicating shocks very freely, all motion
 immediately ceased, and no irritation could excite the electrical
shock.
    1 never received     a shock from a torpedo,    when held by the
extremities     of the lateral fins or tail.
    The preceding account appears to me to afford grounds for
the   following conclusions.
    J. That the electrical discharge of this animal is in every re
spect a vital action, being dependent on the life of the animal,
and having a relation to the degree of life and to the degree of
perfection of structure of the electrical organs.
    2. That the action of the electrical organs is perfectly volun
tary.
    3. That frequent action of the electrical organs is injurious
to  the life of the animal ; and, if continued, deprives the animal
of it. vIs this only an instance of a law common to all animals,
that by long continued voluntary action they are deprived of life?
Whence is the cause of the rapidity with which it takes place in
this instance ?      Or is it owing to the reaction of the shock on
the animal ?
   4. That those animals, in which the nerves of the electrical
organs are intersected, lose the power of communicating            the
shock, but appear more vivacious, and live longer than those in
   Vol. 48. No. 219. July 1816.                  B               which

18                  On the Cosmogony       of Moies.
which this change has not been produced, and in which this
power is exerted.      Is the loss of the power of communicating
the shock to be attributed to the loss of voluntary power over
the organ ?     Does this fact bear any analogy to the effects pro
duced by castration in animals ?
    5. That the possession of one organ only is sufficient to pro
duce the shock.
    6. That the perfect state of all the nerves of the electrical
organs is not necessary to produce the shock.
    And, 7. From the whole it may be concluded, that a more
intimate relation exists between the nervous system and electri
cal organs of the torpedo, both as to structure and functions,
than between the same and anv organs of any animal with which
we are acquainted.       And this is particularly shown, 1st, By the
large proportion of nerves supplied to the electrical organs :
 and, 2d, By the relation of the action of the electrical organs
to the life of the animal, and vice versa.
    V. Reply   to  Dr. Prichard       on the Cosmogony   of Moses.
                            By F. E         s.
                            To  Mr.   Tilloch.
Sir,—     W    ith commendable prudence, Dr. Prichard passes
lightly over the tender ground of his inconsistent assertions ;
 affirming, in allusion to the direct proof I had given of tl em, that
 I am " still determined to find contradictions between proposi
tions which have no relation to each other," and that I quarrel
" even with the words in which they are expressed." If these
two affirmations be not absolutely correct, they are, at least, in
correctness absolutely equal.       He cannot " stay to notice mere
cavils," but hastens to exhibit     "  a specimen of the mode of rea
soning adopted by"      his " pertinacious critic."   I shall now en
deavour to show whether what he has produced for that pur
pose be a specimen of my logic or of his own fairness ; and in
this attempt as well as on similar occasions he will, I trust, have
the goodness to endure repetitions which he has rendered un
avoidable. — " In my last paper," says he, " I hinted at the in
stance of St. Matthew and St. Luke, in order to prove that in
spired writers have chosen to avail themselves of historical do
cuments, when such sources of information were to be found.
Mr. F. E. seems to allow the force of this example, but denies
that it leads to any inference with respect to Moses ; and the
exception he takes against it is to the following purport.         St.
Matthew and St. Luke found pre-existing documents, which it

                       On  the Cosmogony       of Moses.                    19
only required in them human sagacity to adopt; but Moses, it
seems, had nothing but the light of revelation to guide him;
consequently he made no use of records.               Now there is," con
tinues he, '. one grand objection to this conclusion ; viz. that it
takes for granted the chief thing intended to be proved."               There
is also, I would remind Dr. Prichard, one grand objection to the
whole argument ; viz. that it is not exactly mine.             My exception
rests on the want of analogy in the cases : in the one, inspira
tion appears to be superfluous, in the other indispensable.               The-
compilation of a genealogy, of which the materials were ue
know recorded in Scripture, needed no inspiration. The manner
of the creation could be known with certainty to no human
being, not even to Moses, except by a revelation.                    Besides,
there is in Scripture neither hint nor trace of any revelation con
cerning the creation, anterior to Moses; nor is there any other
ground for the belief of inspired documents or traditions of which
he might have availed himself, than that of vague and visionary
conjecture*. But waiving this consideration, and supposing that
there may have existed in the time of Moses documents or tra
ditions of such a primitive revelation ; there could, if he was
inspired with regard to the creation, be no possible motive for
his having recourse to them.           In such circumstances it is quite
idle to talk of an inspired writer choosing to avail himself of
other authorities in preference to the immediate authority of
 Heaven. The version of my argument, therefore, should not
have been generally, that " Moses had nothing but the light of
revelation to guide him ; consequently he made no use of re
cords:" but that, with regard to the creation, Moses having the
light of revelation to guide him, there is no assignable reason
why he should Be made to have recourse to assumed records or
 traditions.     I do not perceive that the one grand objection ap
 plies to this conclusion.
    Dr. Prichard disclaims the merit which he erroneously con
 ceives I intended to ascribe to him, of having formed the " in
 genious imagination" of circuitous inspiration.              I am, indeed,
 ignorant    to  whom   this  not  recent    invention    is due ; but as an
 auxiliary whom he esteems
                                   "  perfectly  well  informed   respecting
 the points in controversy       t"   had employed it in his favour, I
 confess that by showing its insufficiency in the case to which it
 was applied, I intended to prevent its adoption by the principal.
  Of his protest against the pretensions of those who, like me,
  " talk largely about circuitous inspirations, and immediate in
  spirations," I can merely express an unconsciousness of enter-
    * Dr. Prichard, however, esteems it most unrelentingly inquisitorial of
  me to require any better proof of this assumed primitive revelation.

spiration." The points in discussion do not, however, require
that 1 should offer any opinion on the historical facts which de
termine him to believe that Moses was not the original author
of the Cosmogony ;" it is sufficient that 1 have shown some of
the consequences which result from such a supposition.           I shall
only add, that his hypothesis, which gives the Hebrew, Hindoo,
 and Etruscan Cosmogonies a common but unascertained origin
 of higher antiquity than Moses, will scarcely be thought calcu
 lated to induce any very strong belief that the hidden source of
 this common origin was Heaven.
     I am charged with having unfoundedly insinuated that Dr.
 Prichard rested his interpretation of the word day, solely on the
 authority of Josephus and Philo.       If what I have written admit
 such a construction, I most explicitly disavow it ; but if it be
 found that what I said, so far from containing such an absurd
 insinuation, contains no insinuation whatever, Dr. Prichard may
 possibly retract his imputation.     1 had replied to some of his ar
 guments adduced in support of the figurative sense of the word
 day, when he reminded me that I had overlooked the authority
  of Josephus and Philo. My answer to this contained nothing
 that it did not directly express : " If," said I, " he rest the me
 taphorical sense of the word day on their authority, he must
 also on the same authority admit a figurative sense of the
  whole first chapter of Genesis."      Why this answer should have
 the misfortune to displease him I know not, since he avows that
 it has been his "endeavour to show that every part of the first
                                                      '
  chapter of Genesis is more or less metaphorical.        I really have
 no distinct conception of the modification here intended by the
 words " more or less;" but if "every part" be metaphorical,
 the whole it may be presumed can be neither more nor less than
 allegorical.
     In his zeal to establish his coincidences, and to apply to some
 useful purpose his discovery of the true sense of the 20th verse of
 the first chapter of Genesis, Dr. Prichard with the stroke of a
 pen deprived myriads of animals of locomotion.           When it was
 afte wards objected to him, that even his own version of this
 verse "does not exclude testaceafrom the
                                               fifth day's creation,"
 a considerable portion of the order being indisputably endued
 with locomotion;" instead either of acknowledging or defending
 his error, he is pleased to say, that he " shall not enter further
 into the inquiry what place corals and bivalves hold in the scale
 of creation, whether they are, as F.E. declares, locomotive
 animals, or approach to the character of vegetables:" gravely
                                                                 adding

   adding that
                    " the question has been decided in his favour by a
   third person," competent and impartial, to whose satisfactory
   remarks he refers.         It is indeed true, that in the remarks re
   ferred to, there arc unsupported assertions that the order of
   testacea is destitute      of locomotion : if this, therefore, be suffi
  cient,    the question is certainly decided against me.              Having,
  however, a presentiment, that, notwithstanding                  the " crambe
  repetita," Dr. Prichard will condescend to honour this letter
  with some notice, I am desirous of appealing from this decision,
  even to himself, and would venture directly to ask him, whether
  the whole order
                        of testacea be destitute of locomotion* ? If on
  recollection, after consulting naturalists, it be found that an af
  firmative answer cannot be given, he will, it may be supposed,
  be constrained, at the expense of his coincidences, to restore at
  least a part of the order to the
                                          fifth day's creation. I have yet
  one other question, to which it more nearly concerns him to re
  turn an explicit answer.             He peremptorily and tauntingly af
  firms, that I declare corals and bivalves are locomotive ani
  mals.       Of the part of this assertion which relates to bivalves
  I ask for no explanation, though it may easily be perceived that
 some of them were meant to be included in the portion of the
 order of testacea excepted from being " indisputably endued
 with locomotion       f;   but I am entitled to ask where Dr. Prichard
 found, either directly or even by inference, the declaration he
attributes to me, that corals are locomotive animals?                       My
 assertion respecting locomotive animals (as has just been seen)
instead of extending beyond, did riot even include the whole or
der of testacea ; and with regard to corals, as comprehended in
 zoophytes,       it will be seen that the motion which it cannot be

shell described by Lister, Brown, Forsksil, and other naturalists. which
 ilfrives its clairn9 of distinction from Helix, not su much from the charac
 ter of the shell as from that of the animal, which differs in its structure
materially from the animal of the Helix, since it is furnished with a curious
apparatus (being an inhabitant of the sea) for swimming, instead of that for
crawling, with which the Helices are provided.''

psdia, article Shell.
    t Some bivalves, even of the genus Ostrea, give indisputable proofs of
locomotive powers. " Scallops leap out of the water to the distance of half a
yard." (Nicholson's Encyclopedia.)           Speaking of the same bivalve, Bur
row in his Conchology, page 80, says, " Strong locomotive powers have
been attributed to the Pecten, which are, it is said, exerted in a most
singular manner.       A very rapid progress is effected by the sudden opening
and closing of the shell.       This is done with so much muscular force as to
throw it four or five inches at a time.       In the water an equal dexterity is
evinced by the animal, in raising himself to the surface, directing his course
ad libitum, and suddenly, by the shutting of his valves, dropping to the
bottom."

As Dr. Prichard had not displaced forest trees, shruls and li-
chens from the third day's creation, although in strictness none
                                             "
of them come under the description of grass, seed-bearing
herbs, or fruit -bearing trees:" — "on the same principle," I
observed, " it maybe thought that zoophytes might be permitted
to remain in the fifth day's creation, being moving creatures that
have life, although their motion does not precisely accord with
the idea which, in opposition to the received translation, Dr.
Prichard thinks the Septuagint and the original convey."        So
far is this passage   from containing any assertion of the locomo
tion of zoophytes, that it contains two admissions of the con
trary.    First, it is admitted by inference, that they do not in
strictness come under the description of locomotive animals;
and afterwards it is acknowledged that their motion does not
precisely accord with the idea (of locomotion) which Dr. Pri
chard thinks the original text of Genesis conveys."
   A subtle or complex argument may, in consequence of mis
conception, be misrepresented ; but of the process by which a
simple assertion is converted into a declaration totally different,
I do not pretend to anticipate the explanation.

VI.     On the     Diving-Bell, as a Means for curing Deafness.     By
                      Dr. Hamel, of St. Vetersburgh.
                              To   Mr.   Tilloch.
             w hen
                 visiting the harbour which is now building at
Howth, near Dublin, I wished to make myself acquainted with
the manner in which the diving-hel! for constructing the mason-
work under water is used, and obtained permission to descend.
   When the mouth of the bell was about two feet under wa
ter,    I   began to feel   pain in both ears, occasioned   by the pres
sure  of the condensed air against the membrana tympani; the
air in the inner cavity of the ear being of less density. Fear
ing that this pain might become troublesome at a considerable
depth, I made exertions to admit air through the Eustachian
tube into the ear.   I happened to accomplish this at first onlv
on one side, the air rushed into the cavity of the right ear, and
the pain ceased instantly.   As the bell continued going down,
the pain returned; but as I repeated my exertions to open the
Eustachian tube, the air at intervals found its way through           it,
                                                                    and

                        as a Means for curing Deafness.                     23
and re-established    the equilibrium. Through the left Eustachian
tube no   air had yet      passed, and the pain in the left ear was
gradually increasing.       When about fourteen feet under water, the
sensation was as if a stick was forced into that ear from without.
At last, during one of the exertions to open the mouth of the
Eustachian tube on that side, the air forced its way with consi
derable violence through         it,and    was relieved of the pain also
                                           I
on that side.
    After examining the mason-work of the pier at the bottom of
the sea,I    began to ascend.         Here     soon felt pain again, re
                                               I
sulting  from   the air  in  the inner cavity of the ear expanding, as
the external pressure diminished:          but this pain was more easily
relieved, the air gushing at very short intervals without any
voluntary exertions in small portions froin the ear through the
Eustachian tube into the mouth.
    Noticing this,      occurred to me, that the diving-bell might be
                        it
used for curing      deafness in those cases where            itdepends on
an obstruction      of the Eustachian tube.           The patient would
have to go down in           a  diving-bell and make those exertions
which open the mouth of the Eustachian tube, and then the
pressure of the condensed air would force its way through the
extent of the tube, and          bythat means clear the passage.           It   is
well known, that slight obstructions have been frequently re
moved,    by  forcing air or tobacco-smoke from the cavity of the
mouth into the ear.         When      Iwas in the diving-bell, and made
my exertions to admit air into the Eustachian tube,                I was not
aware of the simple way in which                effected.
                                               it   is       Dr.Wollaston
informed me, that, nothing            wanted but to swallow the saliva,
                                      is
as may be seen from the following simple and easy experiment.
Close your nostrils with your fingers and suck with your mouth
shut; air will come through the Eustachian                  tube from the
ear, and you feel pressure on the 'membrana                tympani, which
prevents you from hearing distinctly.           As the end of the Eusta
chian tube nearest to the mouth acts like             valve, this sensation
                                                          a
will often remain even after you have ceased sucking.            To remove
it, nothing    iswanted but to swallow saliva, whereby the action of
the muscles seems to open the end of the Eustachian tube, and
then the air rushes in to re-establish the equilibrium.             This ex
periment    shows   on  a  small   scale  part of  what      experienced in
                                                              I
tiie diving-bell    ;where,    to  admit  the  air into  the  ear. one must
merely swallow saliva, and at one of these exertions the air will
rush in,  if the obstruction be not very considerable.
 I    was anxious to know, whether men that had been in diving-
bells before, had noticed the same sensations as myself, and made      I
them describe to me. what they had felt.              Among other things
they stated, that when at        a great depth      had been to them
                                                         it              " as

 rushing   in of the air through the  Eustachian  tube.
     There are now several diving-bells in use.      Besides the one
 at Howth, there is one at Holvhead, one at Ramsgate, and one
 at Plymouth-      They are constructed under the superintendance of
 Mr. Rennie, on Mr. Smeaton's plan, entirely of cast iron, in the
 form of an oblong chest open at bottom. — (See Dr. Brewster's
 Encyclopedia, article Diving Bell.)
     The one in which I descended is six feet long by four feet wide,
 and six feet high, with twelve patent glass-lights, as used in ships'
 decks, on the top.      A descent in a diving-bell of this construc
 tion may be undertaken without any inconvenience, except the
 above described sensation in the ears.      1 was for half an hour
 under water more than twenty teet deep, and had light more
 than enough to write and read.       A constant supply of fresh air
 is given by means of a forcing pump, and the respiration is not
in the least affected. The signals to the men, who manage the
bell above the water, are given by means of striking with a ham
mer once, twice or more times against the inside of the bell.
The number of strokes tells them in what direction you wish to
be moved.      A diving-bell of the above dimensions may hold four
men.
    I wish much that some deaf person or persons, whose deafness
is owing to the cause above stated, might try the diving-bell ; and
should they be benefited by        it,
                                    hydraulic or other pressure en
gines might be constructed to obtain the same end in houses or
hospitals.

                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    A few weeks since          I   was  requested by a respectable
surgeon to examine       a fragment      of calculus voided by      a female
patient of his.     The fragment weighed about three grains and
a half, had somewhat of a rhomboidal figure ; was evidently con
vex on the one side, and concave on the other.                  The convex
surface was considerably nodulated,        but   the  concave   was smooth.
When viewed with a magnifier, it showed distinct marks of strati
fication of alternate layers of a grayish and dirty yellow coloured
substance.      On being heated to redness before the blowpipe it
lost nearly "3 of its weight; that       is,
                                           after     had been kept in the
heat of boiling water for some time             :    by it
                                                      urging the heat still
furtherit   fell to powder, lost     its  former     colour, and gained     a
slight tinge of red, losing more than          1.
                                                 more of its weight.
I    was then induced to try the effect of acids on this substance,
and accordingly took a portion of              itwhich had been treated
as above,    and found   it to dissolve in muriatic acid without ef
fervescence, leaving but the smallest possible quantity, which              I
conceived to be animal matter.           I then took a portion of the
substance as   it was voided, which dissolved also in muriatic acid,
but with considerable effervescence.           I was at first unwilling to
attribute the effervescence to carbonic acid           but upon examina

tions were next examined, and were          found   to contain   lime, phos
phoric acid, and iron.        Therefore the calculus         iscomposed of
carbonate and phosphate of lime, and oxide of iron, with               avery
minute portion of animal matter; for when the residuum, which
was found to be insoluble in muriatic acid, was separated and
heated to redness on     a slip of platina,        exhibited distinctly the

Sir, — Unwilling        to trespass on your pages by a long letter,
I  forbore to notice in my last, that it appears on the authority
of Pliny, that meteoric stones or aerolites were supposed to have
fallen from the body of the sun ; your pages record that some
modern philosophers have imagined them to have been projected
from the moon.       I will not trouble you at this time with any
arguments in support of an opinion, that they are generated in
the regions between our earth and the nearest planets ; but since
I do not remember that any of your correspondents have no
ticed the circumstance, I wish to mention that the same author
records a report that Anaxagoras Clazomenius had predicted
the fall of a meteoric stone, and that the prediction was verified.
[Lib.ii.c. 58.]
     If,
       sir, we admit the report to have been correct, may we not
infer that astronomical calculations and       regard to planetary

                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
J5iR,   —   The     principal arguments      that  have  been advanced
 against the existence of a material fluid of heat, are those de-
 riyecrfrom the experiments on the generation of heat by friction:
 frotri those   experiments it is inferred, that the quantity of heat
 contained     in a given piece of metal is inexhaustible.      No di
 rect experiment, however, has been made in support of this
 opinion ; but because a piece of metal connected with and sur
 rounded by conductors, continued to give out heat as long as
 friction was applied, the author of the experiments concludes,
 " that
           any thing which any insulated body, or system of bodies,
 can continue to furnish without limitation, cannot possibly be a
                            '
 material substance."
      If heat be a material fluid, the effect of force on a body con
 taining it would be similar to the effect of force on a body con
  taining any other fluid diffused through its pores in a similar
  manner.      Water being a fluid which in many instances produces
  effects similar to those produced by heat, it appears best adapted
  to illustrate the generation of heat by friction.
      I procured a piece of light and porous wood, three inches in
  length, two in width, and one in thickness ; and having im
  mersed it in water till it was saturated, I fixed it firmly over a
  vessel filled with water, the lower end being about half an inch
  below the surface of the water, and then moved a piece of hard
  wood backwards and forwards on the upper end, with a consi
  derable degree of pressure.        I thus found that water could be
  raised through     the pores   of wood    by friction. The process is
  easily understood : the rubber, or piece of hard wood, as it is
  moved along, presses        the water out of the pores, and closes
  them, driving the water which is pressed out before it ; but
  when the rubber has passed over those pores, the water from
  below rushes into them to restore the equilibrium.
       The action of the blunt borer in Count Rumford's experiments
   appears to have produced a similar kind of effect ; the heat
   having been forced out of the pores of the metal by the borer,
   its place would be supplied by the heat from the adjacent parts.
   Gun-metal being a good conductor, the neck which connected
   the cylinder with the cannon would be capable of giving passage
   to all' the heat that was accumulated from the cannon, and the
   other conductors with which it was connected.
       Count Rumford considered it improbable that the heat could
   have been supplied by means of the small neck of metal, be
   cause heat was, given out by it during the whole of the experi
                                                                  ment ;

   ment   ;  but one body may give out heat to another of a lower
   temperature, and yet be in the act of conducting heat.
       If some imperfect conductor could have been substituted for
   the neck of metal, a difference. in the quantity of heat generated,
   in a given time, would no doubt have been the consequence j
  but, unfortunately, this mode of varying the experiment did not
  occur to Count Rumford.

  XI.    On the Ventilation      of Mines.         By Jambs Watt, M.D. of
                                      Glasgow.
                                To    Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir, — Tins late success of science, in obviating the danger
  from deleterious gases in mines, must be grateful alike to the
  philosopher and philanthropist.              If you judge the following ideas
  conducive     to  the completion      of   a  design so important, your in
  sertion of them will      much     oblige   the  writer.
      The merit of Sir Humphry Davy's lamp seems to justify its
  high character.        Previous to this invention, the existence of the
  deadly explosive gas was detected in most cases only by the sad
  experience of its destructive effects ; now, the danger may be
  safely detected and easily avoided.               This lamp, however, does
  not prevent     the  production     of  the   gas, nor render the workings
 safe where it greatly abounds.            Nor   does it prevent the danger of
 explosion in other cases, as when a fire is used, at the bottom
 of the upcast pit, to promote the ventilation.                  Besides, this
 lamp is not calculated to clear the mine of the carlonic acid gas,
 which, though detected with less danger than the other, is also
 deleterious to the workmen.                Indeed, the principal merit of
 Davy's     invention   is, that  it  enables the miner to detect, by his
 light, the explosive gas, with equal safety and certainty as he
 formerly discovered the presence of the other.                The most pro
 per use of the discovery in both cases will be the same, — to make
 his escape, with all practicable expedition, till by the aid of
ventilation the enemy be dislodged.
     It is evident then, that though a complete method of ventila
tion would supersede the use and necessity of all such contri
vances as Davy's lamp, however ingenious and sublime ; yet no
such invention could supersede the necessity of ventilation.                To
find a plan of ventilation, as practicable and as effectual as pos
sible, is therefore an object of high importance.
     In mines which are furnished with several shafts, a degree of
ventilation is for the most part insured by the different tempe
ratures of the atmosphere above and in the interior of the mine.
                                                                             In

                    On the Ventilation of Mines.                         31
 In the hsat of summer the current is likely to descend by the
 shaft whose top stands highest, and to make its exit by the shaft
 whose top stands lowest.        In the cold of winter this current will
 be reversed.     When   the  temperature is equal above ,and below,
 and where the current is too feeble, it must be promoted by fires
 or other artificial means.
     To direct this current through all parts of the workings,
 various contrivances have long been used.            These seem to be
 all superseded by Mr. Ryan's plan described in your last num
                                                                        '
 ber, and the plan of Mr. Menzies, which is somewhat similar.
     The immediate object of both these plans is to obtain from
 all parts of the interior of the mine an uninterrupted          ascent of
 the roof, to the upcast pit, through which the current ascend.".
 If such an ascent can be obtained, the explosive gas will cer
 tainly be discharged by its own specific levity.           But such an
 ascent in the roof of a mine is sometimes prevented or destroyed
 by depressions in the roof, and by large masses of the roof which
 fall, leaving cavities to be receptacles for large quantities of ex
 plosive gas.
     Besides, these plans, at least that of Mr. Menzies, is not so
 well calculated to ensure the discharge of the carbonic acid gas,
 which is itself a great object in ventilation.         This gas is spe
cifically heavier than common air, and lies in the most depressed
parts of the mine.
    Inequalities in the roof or floor of the mine provide for the
retention of one or other of these gases, even in spite of a cur
rent of air passing through the mine.           This may be illustrated
by a transparent arched tube, transmitting         a current of coloured
fluid or of air.     Let an air bubble, or bead of air, occupy the
highest part of the arch, while a stream of coloured fluid is forced
through the tube.        This air-bubble will be seen keeping its
place,   or, if pushed  out  ofit,   regaining it  speedily.    Again, let
the arch be inverted, and let   a     bead of coloured fluid occupy its
lowest part;      while
                      a   stream of air   is  forced through the tube     ;
the coloured fluid will always speedily regain its situation in the
lowest part of the arch.        In this illustration, the stream of fluid
in   the one case, and the stream of air in the other, represent the
current of air ventilating the mine, while the bead of air in the
highest part of the arch, and the bead of coloured fluid in the
lowest part, represent masses of the two foul gases retaining their
situation in cavities in the roof and floor of the mine.       It   istrue
that a    forcible current of air will dislodge these portions of foul
gas; but the ventilating current     is   often not sufficiently powerful
for this purpose.
  But though this ventilation were complete uhen once csta-
Uishedythe danger from deleterious gases must be guarded against
                                                                    during

during the operations, before the communication for the venti
lating current can       be effected, and before the mine and roof could
be subjected to the plans of Ryan or Menzies.
     Even where the works are complete, a change in the tem
perature of the atmosphere may occasion a change in the di
rection of the current, so that what was the vpcast shaft may be
come the downcast shaft*. Against this case, I think, Mr. Men
zies' plan makes no provision.
     A stream of water falling down through one of the shafts is
frequently used as a means of ventilation.               This expedient is
 suited, I think, to the case where only          carbonic acid gas is pre
sent ; and besides, as the water must be lifted afterwards, this
 mode of ventilation is too expensive to be practicable, except
en extraordinary occasions.
     It appears then that a mode of ventilation by mechanical
 means, and completely under control, woukl be highly eligible
 in  a great variety of cases.
      Ventilation    by mechanical means must be effected by a blowing
 apparatus of some sort.          This apparatus must be applied, either
 to J'orce a quantity of air into the mine, by which the foul gases
 mav be displaced, or to extract these gases out of the mine,
 while common air will replace them spontaneously.                In either
 case, a tube     should    extend   from  the blowing apparatus to that
 part of the mine in which ventilation will be chie8y required and
 most useful. The mode of ventilation by extraction seems most
 eligible, for two reasons : 1st, The extracting tubes can be di
rected to any spot in the roof or floor of the mine where the foul
 gas is lodged, and this gas only needs to be removed ; but by
 blowing into the part, a quantity of harmless or salutary air must
 also be forced away.         2dly, By the mode of extraction by a tube,
 the foul gas is kept in a state of separation in its progress through
 the mine and up the shaft ; but if it were to be discharged by
 blowing inward, it might come in contact with the lights in its
progress, and explode, or prove otherwise dangerous or dis
 agreeable.
     The extracting or blowing tube would be the most expensive
part of this apparatus.          It should be flexible, or otherwise fitted
to apply to and feed from either the roof or floor at pleasure ; but
it might be formed of the cheapest materials : and in works in
which there is a spare shaft, this shaft may be employed to
form so much of the ventilating tube.
     The best sort of blowing apparatus for ventilating mines is
    * This, if we
                   rightly understand Ryan's system, can never happen where
it is employed.       His upcast and downcast shafts are, we believe, never
suffered to alternate. — Edit.
                                                                  evidently

evidently that which will, in a given time, transmit the greatest
quantity of air, with the least expenditure of power.            Force of
blast, or compression, are in this case no object : mere trans
mission is all that is required.       The common bellows have been
proposed to extract from the mine, by a tube descending from
the valve into the mine*.            But here much power would ba
wasted in rendering the blast forcible, and time in discharging
it. An air-pump with a piston has been also proposed; but
against it the same objections are valid ; beside the additional
waste of power in overcoming the friction of the piston.          A large
vessel, pr rather a number of vessels, inverted in a receptacle of
water, and alternately raised and lowered by an axis revolving,
and furnished with cranks, or otherwise producing its effect,
would form a powerful blowing apparatus.
    But, the principle of the fax or fannbr, — the winnowing
appauatus, seems free from all objections, and possesses the
greatest advantages.        It transmits a great quantity of air. Its
movement is rotative, and hence it can be attached to the gin
or gig employed in raising the minerals, and even placed on the
same axis, so that the expense of construction will be trifling.
It acts by a centrifugal principle, and hence its powers of trans
mitting air can be augmented to any assignable degree.                It is
only needful to increase the diameter of the circle and the power,
and to make the entrance and exit for the air of suitable capa
city.     It cau feed either from one end of the axis, or from both ;
hence, either end may be inclosed, or tubes may extend from
both ends to different parts of the mine.         The fan, as has' been
said, may be placed on the same axis, as the gin or gig, above
ground, and wrought by the same power.              It may be placed in
any   convenient    situation   below,  and   wrought by the power of
men, horses, asses or oxen.         It may  stand  vertically or horizon
tally, and it may feed by numerous tubes extending to either
end of its axis, from different parts of the roof or floor of the
mine, while it discharges into a spare shaft, or into the lower
end of the shaft employed for lifting the water, by one large tube
extending from the circumference of the box containing the
fan.     In this way the expense of a tube would be sas-ed by using
this shaft ; for the explosive gas, at least, being introduced into
the bottom of the shaft, would ascend by its own specific levity.
The fan, thus employed, might obviate all danger both while the
 works are forming and afterward : and it is fitted to obviate all
the interruption of ventilation from inequalities in the roof or
 floor of the mine.       It is even suited to supersede the necessity

least, for the purpose of ventilation ; for this might be effected
by means of a tube carried down in one side or angle of a single
shaft, and extending to the various parts of the excavation be

 Combined effect.
    Mr. Editor, 1 am aware that the fan has been used to How
down a shaft a short way, but I am not aware that it has been
 employed in the above mode for extracting the foul gases from
 mines.     Nor do I know that the vessels inverted in water have
been used or proposed as a blowing apparatus. The powers and
 capabilities of the fan will appear to any one who has seen Mr.
 Sadler inflating his exhibition balloon.
    The above ideas, on employing the fan, were lately read to the
 Glasgow Philosophical Society at two of their weekly meetings.
 The members present recommended that they should be given
 to the public through some of the scientific journals.

                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
 jjiR, — ^Mtjch has been lately said respecting the comparative
merits of the Nautical Almanac, and the Oonnaissance des Terns ;
and attempts have been made to show that the computers of the
ratter work have borrowed very considerably from the former. -
There are two facts, however, which I have recently discovered,
that will (I think) evidently show that the computations in those
works are carried on independently of each other.           These facts
                                                                     '
relate to Jupiter's satellites.                                    v
  . The configurations    of those satellites, as set down in the Nau
tical Almanac for the last month (June), are almost all of them
wrong ; as I found from actual observation, and a* may be readily
proved by calculation : many of them likewise are incorrectly
stated for the ensuing month of August.            In the Connaissance
des Terns, however, the positions are truly stated.
    On the other hand, the eclipses of those satellites are all cor
rectly computed in the Nautical Almanac : but, in the Con
naissance des Terns the eclipses of the first satellite are set down
very incorrectly ; there being a constant error, which sometimes
amounts to six minutes of time, either in excess or defect. This
mistake runs through the whole of the years 1815, 1816 and,
                                                                  1817J

 1817; and has arisen (I presume) from an error in Lalande's
 Tables at the end of the first volume of his Astronomy, p. 250,
where the Argument C is erroneously stated 3000 too great, in
the mean conjunctions from 1812 to 1820; an error which has
been    carefully avoided by Mr. Vince in his edition.
     Whilst I am upon the subject of the Nautical Almanac, may
 I be allowed to ask whether any of your readers can inform me
 why the very excellent and useful preface which usually accom
panies that work, has been omitted by the present Astronomer
Royal, in the publications for the years 1817 and 1818.               The
tables from which that work is computed have been successively
improved ; and an account of the same, together with a state
ment of the tables used by the computers for the time being, has
been hitherto preserved in the preface above alluded to.             But a
person who may now be desirous of ascertaining the correctness
of any of the calculations, would be at a loss to know to what
tables he should refer.         This is the more to be regretted, as it is
notorious that there is a considerable variance with correspond
ing calculations in other similar works.                         ' .  • v
     For example, the times of new and full moon, as given in the
Nautical Almanac, and in the Connaisscynce des Terns, for the
present year, differ frequently (after allowing for the difference
of meridians) many minutes, and oftentimes many hours from
 each other.        This inequality in the results must, however, -be
attributed to some other source than the use of a different set- of
tables ; all of which boast of considerable accuracy: yet, as it
shows the necessity of a computation from the tables themselves,
when any nice calculation           is required, the knowledge of the
identical tables made use of in the formation of the ephemeris,
might lead to a detection of the error ; as we have already seen
in the case of Jupiter's satellites.                   . . '
     I shall not, however, intrude further on your indulgence, at
present; my object being merely to call the attention of your
readers (who may have more leisure) to an investigation of the
subject : and I shall be happy if it be the means of correcting
any errors which at present exist, or which in future may be likely
to occur in those truly valuable works.

XITI.     Erp(rimt>T>H   with Sir H. Daw's Stifs-Lamp.          By
                   Dr. Hamhi., of St. Peterslur gn.
Somf. ti Hie ago I had an opportunity of trying Sir Humphry
Davy's lnmp in a coal-mine near Holywell in Flintshire. I de
scended (along with Mess. William and Edward Roscoe) the pit
of Deebank colliery, 140 yards deep, and then proceeded hori
zontally in one of the metal-drifts, where in one place the in
flammable gas was bubbling with considerable force through the
water, covering the bottom of the mine.        The ventilation here
being so complete as to prevent any danger from explosion, I
kindled the gas with a common candle.          It continued burning
with a flame about 1 \ foot long.       Sir Humphry Davy's lamp>(
 held in the same current would not set fire to it.    Wc now w«nt
 to a place near the end of the working, where in the roof of the
 mine 'there is a considerable excavation constantly filled with
 carb'jTc tted hydrogen, issuing from a fi6bure in the roof on that
 spot.    Holding the safety-lamp in the lower part of this exca
 vation, where the inflammable gas is always mised with atmo
 spheric air, a succession of slight explosions took place in the
 inside of the lamp; but when raised into purer inflammable gas,
 the whole of the cylinder was filled with a faint blueish flame,
 through which that of the wick was distinctly visible. On lifting
 it still higher into the purest carburetted hydrogen, the lamp
 appeared extinguished, but rekindled spontaneously when in-
 stnntly withdrawn into atmospheric air.
     Having convinced myself that the lamp would not set fire to
 the gas (and having been breathing the tame for some time, to
 try iu effects when taken into the lungs), wc' approached it with
 a common candle tied to a long stick.       The gas took fire with
 considerable explosion, the lowermost stratum being mixed with
 atmospheric air, and the remainder continued burning for some
 time, filling three-fourths of the mine with an undulating blaze.
 The appearance was awful, and gave me some notion of the man
 uer in which those unfortunate persons perish, who meet with,
 their death from accidents of this kind.
    The lamp with which we made the experiment had a cylinder
 of bi ass-wire gauze.     It had become very hot during our trials
 with it, and 1 think the flame was greener than is common to
 carburetted hydrogen from coal-mines.       I should suppose brass
 or copper wire would not stand so long as iron-wire gauze.

 Mr. Buddie writes me that he has had several lamps with irtm-
 gauze cylinders for three months in daily use, without being in
 the slightest degree impaired although "they have been frequently
 red hot for a considerable length of time."       The chief doubts

    Hamburgh.                  By M. Pierard, Captain                       of   Enginee

 has the property  of being preserved     much longer time than  a
 beef preserved in any other way.
    The preparations necessary, are in the first place    salting-                          a
 house, some trays or tubs proportioned to the size of the pieces
 of meat, and a drying-room in which they are to be placed when
 properly salted.
       In
      the salting-house                  is
                                         a         kind of table made of oak, on which
 the tubs are            and each has
                          placed,           coverlid, with   a handle to                a
 it.  They are besides most carefully hooped, to prevent any waste
 of brine.    The salting-house      generally     cellar, on account of
                                                    is                a
 the temperature being cooler.
     The drving- place     generally part of
                                    is            barn, into which ena
 ters the flue from    small chimney.
                               a           To   the roof are affixed two
 or three wooden beams or frames from           which   the meat     sus.-                       is
 pended          by
               books.   The height of the drying-room above the
 fire intended to give the necessary smoke,        generally from twelve

 to sixteen metres, in order that, during its ascension into the
 flue, the smoke may be freed from a great part of the substances
 which constitute the soot, and thereby less bitterness be commu

foom apertures       are made about thirty centimetres diameter:
and at one end, one or two other apertures of fifty centimetres in
breadth by seventy in height are made, which may be closed at
pleasure by means of a shutter.
 ,  In large establishments, where not only pieces of beef of all
sizes are smoked, but also hams, sausages and tongues, the drying-
or smoking-room is erected over the salting-room, and the smoke
is introduced through apertures made in the floor or in the sides,
 and which apertures may be opened and closed according to
 the quantity of smoke wanted.
    The method generally pursued, in order to prepare smoked
beef, consists in first salting the meat before subjecting it to the
 action of the smoke in the drying-room.' After having chosen
 the pieces of beef which contain the fewest bones, they are
 allowed to remain untouched for two or three days, that the
 meat may become more tender, taking care to place them in a
very cool place, not humid, and defended from the rays of the
aun. Care is taken not to employ too lean meat, because it takes
salt badly, and the -larger pieces of fat are removed, because they
on the other hand are prejudical.         Pieces which weigh from eight
to twelve kilogrammes are preferable to smaller, which contain
always more or less bone, notwithstanding the operation of taking
out the bones to which they are subjected.             When they smoke
pieces of beef which weigh from four to eight kilogrammes, it is
with a view to use them soon afterwards, and in this case they
are smoked much less than when they are intended to be kept
longer.
    Winter   is the period when the greatest quantities of smoked
beef are prepared, because putrefaction is less to be guarded
against at this season, and at the same time the meat is always
most tender.
    Old salt (clean muriate of soda) is regarded as the best, and
it is used grated or pounded. New salt being generally deli
quescent is less adapted for sailing, because it communicates a
bad taste to the meat, renders its colour dull, and docs not give
it the consistency requisite to its preservation.
    In order to salt meat, the pieces are placed on the oak table
before mentioned, when salt is strewed over them, and they are
afterwards rubbed on all sides with a flat stone, in order that they
may impregnate the more.            This operation is repeated until the
meat    absorbs   salt  no  longer.    There is no fear of oversaving ;
for  it can only  absorb   a  certain quantity of salt, and it is easy to
freshen it by steeping it in water before using it.           When this
operation is terminated, the beef is heaped up in layers in a tub,
at the bottom of which some brine has been put.             This brine is
prepared by     boiling  salt  with  seven   or eight times its weight of
                                                                   water,

whole is concluded with a strong layer of salt,         and the pieces
are covered with a lid, on which a weight is placed sufficient to
plunge them in the brine.
   In about three weeks, more or less, according to the bulk of
the pieces, salt, and the time which it is wished to preserve them,
they are withdrawn from the tubs : they are suffered to drip,
and are then carried to the drying -room, where they generally
remain fifteen days, or three weeks, to receive during that time
the action of the smoke of a fire, which is kept up with only
three or four pieces of oak chips, very dry.           It has been re
marked, that the smoke of resinous woods makes the meat con
tract a very disagreeable taste, and that those pieces which re
mained longest in the drying-room        exposed to a feeble smoke
were capable of being kept longer, because a more intimate com
bination took place between the smoke and the constituent prin
ciples of the meat.
   When it is wanted to produce what is call scarlet smoked
beef, the meat is only left seven or eight days in the tubs before
drying     or rather care

40      Thirteenth Report  of the Commissioners  for   making
receipt of toll', which, according to the hest information we have
been able to procure, may probably produce forty thousand
pounds per annum, when the benefit of the canal passage shall
have become thoroughly understood ; but even the present loss,
resulting from delay, is not inconsiderable, because the number
 of labourers and workmen is diminished, while the expenditure
 on management and superintendence remains unaltered.           The
 degree in which this disproportion takes place, may be estimated
 by comparing the number of labourers and workmen now em
 ployed, with the highest average number in any former year ; and
 the average number in the last twelvemonth having been four
 hundred and ninety, shows a decrease of four hundred and sixty-
 nine in nine hundred and fifty- nine, or almost half.   The largest
 number we ever employed was during the three months of June,
 July, and August 1S1 1, averaging at fourteen hundred and four.
 Even this number was not felt as an inconvenience by our super
 intendents, not even at Corpach, where the extraordinary accu
 mulation mostly existed, in consequence of a depression of trade
 at that time, and a consequent stagnation in all branches of
 employment at Glasgow.
     A comparison of the sum of money then and now expended
 in labour, gives nearly the same result.      In our ninth Report
 the sum appears to have been fifty thousand pounds, in our pre
 sent Report thirty thousand ; which again will he much di
 minished in our next Report, unless a larger grant than usual
 shall be assigned to this service in the present session of parlia
  ment.
     This will be understood, when we state, that after it became
 evident to us in the year 1814, that oak timber of proper dimen
  sions for the posts and bars of lock gates, was no longer pro
  curable on any terms, and we had thereupon determined to ap-r
  ply cast iron to that purpose, — no time was lost in employing
  skilful persons in forming models for this new application of
  what from its many and increasing uses in this country, may be
  called a British material ; and alter proper experiments by the
  modellers and iron founders, they became able to furnish a sup
  ply from the iron-works at Butterley in Derbyshire, some part of
  which has already been used at Clachnacharry, and from Pont-
  cysylt^ in Denbighshire, for the Corpach district of the canal,
  of which none is actually arrived, though a freight is now daily
   expected.
      Thus the respective iron foundries being now fairlv in action,
  can furnish any quantity as soon as required ; and the labour
   and time necessary for planking and hanging the gates, after the
  arrival of the cast-irou work materials, makes it desirable to us,
   for the regular progress and uniform completion of all the canal
                                                              worths.

             and maintaining the Caledonian Canal.               41
works, that a sum    of eighteen thousand pounds should be ap
propriated to this expenditure    on iron castings in the next en
suing twelvemonth from the date of this Report : nor will thin
be doubted when we state, that sixteen pairs of lock gates of tlm
kind might at this time he hung in their respective places,        if
ready, no more than two pairs being as yet in action : the«e
 however serve to prove satisfactorilv the facility of their motion,
 two men being able to open or to close them, although no wate?
is in the lock to lighten their weight and pressure.        We shall
postpone any particular description of these newly invented lock
gates, until their actual use shall have enabled us to state all the
 details.
    Adding to the above eighteen thousand pounds, four thousand
pounds for the current expenditure on timber and machinery of
various kinds, and three thousand pounds for management and
miscellaneous expenses, it will appear that no more than twenty-
five thousand pounds will remain for expenditure on labour, and
 that we should be compelled to dismiss many of our experienced
workmen, much to the detriment of the work, in case the quan
tity of labour should afterwards again be increased, as indeed
 ceuld not fail to happen.
     Estimate. We have endeavoured to ascertain the total ex
penditure which will be necessary before the Caledonian canai
 can become- navigable throughout; and we are of opinion, that
 the sum of one hundred and sixty or one hundred and seventy
 thousand pounds will be sufficient ; and as we have twenty-five
 thousand pounds remaining of the last year's grant, two grants
 of seventy-five thousand pounds each, or three grants of fifty
 thousand pounds each, will amply cover the expenditure.
     Being aware that our present estimate is not conformable to
 what might have been expected from our calculation founded
 on Mr. Telford's estimate of October 1813, we have called upon
  him to explain the difference, no change of prices having been
  alleged to have taken place since that time; and it appears
  that to his estimate of two hundred and thirty- five thousand
  pounds, not including payments for land arid for management,
  we added for these purposes eighteen 'thousand pounds, which i»
  so short of the truth, that the payments for land and quarry
  rents will probably exceed that sum : but k is obvious, that we
  could only venture to state the amount of valuations, and that
  we could not control the opinion of a jury; much less could we
  foresee that the intervention of any jury would become necessary}
  the expense of which in itsejf amounted to more than a thousand
   pounds.   In effect, twenty-seven thousand pounds would not
   have been too much to have added to Mr. Telford's estimate,
  considering that the expense of management from that time may
                                                              extend

 42    Thirteenth Report of the Commissioners        for making
extend to six years instead of three, at the rate of about fifteen
hundred pounds per annum.
    Mr. Telford has omitted to, add the usual ten per cent, upon
 engineering estimates, which is more than usually allowable in a
work of unexampled dimensions, and which would have amounted
to twenty-three thousand pounds ; as also the expense of steam
boats for towing large vessels, — and of moorings to be laid down
in the lakes, estimated together at ten thousand pounds *. Thus
 the estimate of October 1813 should have been two hundred
and ninety-five thousand pounds ; since which time one hundred
and twenty-four thousand pounds have been expended, leaving
 about one hundred jmd seventy thousand pounds as the largest
 supposable estimate, from which ten thousand pounds will be
 deducted, if we succeed in placing the locks at Fort Augustus in
 the bed of the river Oich.       A large portion of the per centage
is in reserve for this .contingency, but the greater part may be
.deemed to have been consumed in the unexpected occurrence of
hard ground and rock cutting at Strone and at Muirshearlieh
 (hereafter to be described in this Report) and in dredging ope
rations, of which no experience existed, and which were certainly
under-estimated by Mr. Telford.
    Statb of the Works.           Before we enter into any particular
description    of  the  present  state  of the works along the whole
line of the canal, from Inverness to Fort William, it will be con
venient to advert to certain -general points of information con
 nected therewith.
    Our two superintendents have extended their care to the north
and south ends of Loch Oich respectively; the deepening of the)
Joch by dredging machinery will be assigned to the Clachna-
charry establishment, because experience in that art has been
acquired by them in the similar loch of Doughfour.
   The communication between Clachnacharry and Fort Augustus
is maintained by means of a sloop of sixty-five tons burthen,
which habitually navigates Loch Ness ; and we take this occasion
to observe, that her voyages with an adverse wind are usually
                             ------
made in about twenty-two hours ; that she has not yet experienced
any material detention from the weather, and that the squalls of
                                       ....

 been found to exist     in any prejudicial degree.
     A smaller' sloop of forty tons burthen performs similar service in
 Loch Loehie witli respect to the Corpach establishment, and has
 experienced no difficulty in navigating that lake; a sloop still
 remains at each end of the canal, for the occasional carriage of
 a freight of stone or provender, and the s.ime crews which na
 vigate the sloops on the lakes are then borrowed for that pur
  pose.
     The circtimstances attending the navigation of the Corpach
 sloop in Loch Eil, and the Linnhe loch, are worthy of notice,
 because those lochs differ in nothing from Loch Ness and Loch
 Loehie except in containing salt-water instead of fresh.               In
 spection of any map of Scotland will show that the Linnhe loch
 is in fact a continuation     of the great valley which extends from
  Inverness to the Western Sea.
     The Corpach sloop was built in the year 1804, and for ten
  years navigated these salt-water lakes without intermission, bring
  ing free-stone from Cumbraes in the Firth of Clyde, and rubble-
  stone from Fassefem ; lime from Lismore, and provender from
 Appin.      In all this variety of service and length of time, neither
'the sloop nor any one of her crew have sustained the least
  injury.    Indeed the facility of navigating the Linnhe loch is
  fully  established   by this simple fact; — that the freight and
  insurance of cargoes to Fort William from Glasgow or Ireland
  costs no more than to Oban or Tobermory, which are south of
 -this Linnhe loch ; into which vessels of three or four hundred
  tons burthen frequently run for protection,        and obtain it there
  with such certainty, that not one has been lost since the canal
  works commenced         in the year 1803.        Large vessels of the
  above burthen are now built in     Loch  Eil, an  active and intelligent
 shipwright having very successfully formed an establishment close
  to the sea entrance of the Caledonian canal at Corpach.
     At the other end of the canai, no difficulty of navigation was
  anticipated by those who apprehended danger and detention in
  the lakes; and in fact the head of the Murray-frith (more pro
  perly called Loch Beauley) must be deemed a well protected
  harbour from Fort George to Clachnacharry.
      From this statement we may venture to conclude that all former
  objections to navigation of the Caledonian canal have now been
   removed by experience ; and that the advantage derivable from
  avoiding the dangerous passage northward by Cape Wrath and
  the Orkneys, will suffer no subtraction in the short and expe
  ditious passage which will he open to vessels of all sizes when
  the Caledonian canal is fully opened and in use.
     The absence of alternate tides, and indeed of any perceptible
                                                                   current

44      Tliirleenth Repwt   of the Cammisuotiers  far  making
current in the fresh-water Jakes, might appear to threaten deten
tion in calm weather ; such weather however is not common in
a mountainous region ; and were it otherwise, we are not with
out expectation of giving motion to the largest vessels, by an
expedient which can hardly fail of success.       We here allude to
the new application of the steam-engine for propelling vessels
through the water ; a practice which has been carried to such
extent on the Clyde and elsewhere, that we have been led to
consider how far any such machines might be rendered useful
for saving horse-labour in towing heavy vessels along the Cale
donian canal, and for occasionally assisting them in the lake? .
We are not without hope that (he various steam-engines which
we now possess, especially two of great power, may hereafter be
applied to this purpose with much advantage ; and we shall cause
thi" subject to be carefully investigated without delay.
    The weather during the last twelvemonth, especially the win
ter half-year, has been remarkably unfavourable, as mdeed apTr.
pears from the daily register of the winds and weather [inserted
in the Appendix, and which when it has answered its imme
diate purpose of showing that the winds on the line of the canal
are as variable- as elsewhere, may be applicable for the purposes
of general information.] From the 12th October 1804 to tbea
present time, this register has been kept at Clachnacharry, at
Fort Augustus, and at Corpach, and may be relied on, especially
as to the first and last of these places, for the most perfect
fidelity, and as much precision as the subject admits.
    We have not considered it to be necessarv to repeat in ther
Appendix to thi3 Report, the map which was inserted in the Re
port of last year ; which may be referred to in reading the follow
ing description of the present state of the works along the en
tire line of the canal, as no alteration affecting the map has
 taken place.
    Clachnachakrv District. The present scene of operation?
being much confined to the Middle District, our description of
the state of the works at the two ends of the canal will exhibit
little variation from the Report of last year.
    Beginning as usual at the Inverness end of the canal, we have
 to state that the entrance lock (commonly called the Sea-lock)
 and its gates are in a perfect condition, and that the banks which
are advanced into the sea four hundred yards, in order to obtain
 deep water for the position of this lock, are protected from the
 action of the waves by a coating of refuse stone brought from the
 neighbouring quarry; and as far as the experience of last winter
proves any thing), the safeguard is likely to be effectual.
    Above the high- water mark, the continuation of these hanks
 is of course no further necessary, and at a very small distance
                                                                 was,

                 and maintaininsO the Caledonian Canal.                    45
was  found a spot of indurated clay, on which the second lock H
placed, and by means of       the level of the canal becomes raised
                                     it,
quite out of the reach of ordinary tides.       The gates of the**
two locks are made entirely of wood, as being liable to the ef
fects of the salt-water, and more subject than any others to be
struck     by
           vessels which enter from the sea-ward.
   The temporary dam outside the entrance of the first lock'has
been partly removed, though not to the full depth hereafter ne
cessary for large shipping,   and the excavation of the earth be
tween the first and second locks has proceeded to       correspond
                                                            a
ing level, so that the entrance of coasting vessels would expe
rience no obstacle^
    The .Culvert, which, with aback drain, was found necessary
for draining the low lands of Muirtown, has been finished, and
 discharges into the sea, halfway between the high and low-water
marks.
       The Muirtown Bason extends eastward from theCIachnschany
    or second  lock, terminating at the Muirtown wharf and the ad
    joining bridge.   Here the temporary wooden bridge still con
    tinues in use;  but the iron castings for completing those already
    prepared for the iron turn-bridge,   have been shipped at Gainst
    borough, and probably have been landed at Clachnacharry before
    now; the motion of this bridge, and of all others on the Cale
    donian canal, will be horizontal,    constituting what     usually
                                                                  is
    called a turn-bridge, as distinguished from a draw-bridge, which
    is-raised vertically.
        The four Muiitown locks being connected together, as well as
    with the bridge and wharf,         will require no more than five pairs
    of gates, each pair consisting of two leaves or valves, as usual.
    Of these the upper pair           fmished, and as being more exposed
                                     is
    Iff concussions    than   the  others, is  wholly made of timber; thi#
    ttpper  lock  gate is   hung   in  its place, and has been caulked and
    pitched.     Two    of the  other   gates below (both of the iron-framed
    kind) are also finished and hung in their respective places        ;   one
    Waf of the fourth gate      is set up and   isnow receiving its planking;
     the iron castings for the fifth and last lock-gate are arrived, and
     all the five Muirtown lock-gates will be ready for use before the
     «ul of July next.
        From this place to the bridge at Bught, distant above a reil<>,
     the canal  is finished ;    this bridge, like that at Muirtown, await*
     the iron castings, which will furnish means for substituting an
     iron turn-bridge in place of the wooden bridge now in use.           Half
    a   mile southward from this bridge the canal takes a more westerly
     direction under the steep hill of Torvaine       :     the operation by
      which the river Nesa was diverted from ita former bed for the
-                                                                      kngth

  46     Thirteenth Report   of the Commissioners  for making
  length of half a mile, to make room for the canal and the canal
  bank, has been described in our third Report; and the public
  road has since been turned from the confined and dangerous
 situation which it heretofore occupied between Torvaine and the
 river Ness ; it now passes behind the hill, thus avoiding danger,
  and shortening the distance, at the expense of a moderate ac
 clivity: for "these purposes the new road extends nearly to the
 burn of Doughfour.
     We shall not repeat our former Reports as to the operations
 which have secured the course of the canal from Torvaine to the
  regulating lock, a distance of nearly three miles, throughout
 which the canal is complete, and awaits only the admission of
 water to become navigable.
     The foundations of the regulating lock were of necessity laid
  close to the river Ness, whose ordinary level was about twenty
 feet above the necessary excavations for the lock pit : this diffi
  cult task having been accomplished and the masonry afterwards
 completed in July 18J4, the lock gates ought to have been hung
 long since; but by an unlucky mistake in freighting vessels from
  Gainsborough, part of the cast-iron materials for the lower gate
 is not arrived, though now daily expected.       The upper gate is
 in its place complete, and affords security against the occasional
 floods of the river Ness, which might otherwise by breaking
 through the dikes above, rush into the yet unfilled canal, very-
 much to its injury.
     The process of deepening Loch Doughfour and the passage
 which connects it with Loch Ness, is highly important, and was
 contemplated with some anxiety until the successful operation of
 bur dredging machine had been ascertained, as mentioned in our
 last Report.     The entrance of the canal from Loch Doughfour
 we described to have been then cleared to a sufficient depth for
small vessels, and since that the shallows near Castle Spiritual
have been the chief scene of operation ; the result of which is
 that ninety thousand tons of gravel have been lifted and re
moved within the last twelvemonth, and thereby a passage of
nine feet depth is now open into Loch Ness.          The most im
provable    river channel was found  to be on  the west side of the
Gravel island, so that it became necessary to remove a part of
the point of land on which the ruins of Castle Spiritual will con
tinue to stand close to the brink of the deepened water.-
    A depth of nine or even of ten feet will appear very inadequate
for the passage of large shipping into Loch Ness ; but not only
the channel will be more regularly deepened before the dredging
machine is removed to the Middle District, but the formation of
a dam across the river at the lower end of Loch Doughfour wiH

               and maintaining the Caledonian          Canal.           47
maintain that loch at a high level, and afford the twenty feet
depth of water which is to be established throughout the Cale
donian canal.
    At present nothing hinders coasting vessels from navigating
into Loch Ness from the sea except the want of the lower gate
at the regulating lock, and two lock gates at Muirtown.                Our
own sloops, one of which is now on Loch Ness, one at Clach-
nacharry, will be the first to profit by the opportunity, and will
convey materials to the works in the Middle District at a much
less expense than at present ; and no doubt coal and lime for the
district of Strath-hexrick will be imported largely, and landed at
the pier of Farigag, constructed for this purpose at the termina
tion of the Inverfarigag road.
    Middle District. At the upper end of Loeh-Ness exists
the only considerable obstacle we have to encounter ; for all the
other works require merely labour applied to objects wherqu
from experience we expect no extraordinary difficulty to occur-
But at Fort Augustus a situation is to be found tor the chain of
four locks, or rather for the lowest lock of the four ; for that
once finished and a drainage thereby established, the upper locks
may be constructed with certainty of success. The situation in
which our attempts have hitherto been exerted is at the small
island about two hundred yards above the bridge, ox twice that
 distance from Loch Ness.         It was not difficult to turn the river
 course wholly to the north side of the island by means of proper
dams ; but when this had been effected, the island itself was
found to be so penetrable by water that even a steam-engine pit
could not be sunk without the greatest difficulty.
     It was accomplished however to the requisite depth of tweiity-
eight feet, soon after the date of our last Report, and prepara
 tions for affixing the great steam-engine were forthwith put in
 progress: the necessary piling and platform was finished and the
 engine-house erected last autumn ; and since the weather has
permitted masonry-work to proceed in the present season, the
two large boilers have been fixed, and ^the cylinder, working-
beam and cisterns are now placed in their proper situations.
Hhis great steam-engine, whose cylinder is. four feet in diameter,
will begin to work immediately, that is before the end of June;
and as its power is that which is inadequately* computed to be
equal to that of thirty-six horses, it will lift and discharge an
immense quantity of water; we hope sufficient to permit the
 lock-pit to be sunk, and the future masonry in it to proceed,

 4$      Thirteenth Report   of the Commissioners  for making
without molestation.      Still we have another engine of twenty-
 horse power, which if necessary may be brought from Corpach,
and in the last resort the locks may be placed on the rocky bank
»orth-side of the river Oich. This event however may be con
templated as extremely improbable.
     Until the precise situation of the locks at Fort Augustus cart
 t>e determined,  the course of the canal immediately connected
 with them must also remain unsettled ; for which reason no
commencement of excavation has yet taken place in the Govern
 ment land, which extends six hundred yards above the River
 fcisnd whereon the great steam-engine is erected, and by the
 south-side of which the lower lock will be placed.        The four
 connected locks will occupy a space of two hundred and 6ixty
 yards in length.
     Bevond the march or boundary between the Government land
 tyftl the Lovat property, the canal has been carried on to comple
 tion for the space of four miles, excepting only the Cullachie
 lock, and the additional earth -work which became necessary
 from the change of its situation described in our last Report. *I*
 is remarkable that the rock on which this lock is built, is found
 tO>xtend no further than was necessary for the purpose.         The
 masonry of the lock itself is nearly complete, and the      walls of
 the recess below the lock are commenced, the lower platform
 Laving been bolted down to the solid rock.
    Tiie Glengarry property intervenes between Lovat's southern
boundary and Loch Oich, and in this space, about one mile and
 i-a half in length, the canal is not commenced, the attention of
 cur superintendent in this part of the line being at present oc-
 eapied in preparing a dredging barge for clearing a passage
through Loch Oich.       This operation, though from our expe
rience in Loch Doughfour we may now pronounce it to be sure
m effect, is siow in execution, and unless speedily commenced
in Loch Oich, the navigation of the whole canal may perhaps be
retarded by this obstacle when all others are removed.      For this
reason the carpenters began to work on the dredging barge in
November last, and she is now ready for caulking.     The dredging
machine which is destined to float in this barge is in store at
Bona, and will \>e brought up Loch Ness when necessary. We
have reason to expect that this engine is on an improved con
struction m comparison with that now at work in Loch Dough-
four, advantage having been taken of the experience there ac
quired.     Four discharging boats or punts, which must he in
constant attendance on the dredging barge, are in preparation
at the north end of Loch Oich.
    At the south end of this loch, which is almost four miles in
lengthj the excavation is commenced, and for the first seven

now in progress; but the rocky ground at Strone is not yet all
removed, still remaining nine feet deep for the space of one hun
dred and sixty yards in the bottom of the canal.         From Strone
 to Muirshearlich,  a full mile, the  southern bank   of  the canal is
formed of earth brought from the deep cutting of the latter place,
which has been a very tedious and expensive operation, and will
not be finished until the close of the present season. Last year
we had reason to form the same expectation ; but the earth near
the bottom was unexpectedly found to be unusually hard, and
the weather has been extremelv unfavourable for this kind of
work from the beginning of November almost to the present
time.     The action of the horses which remove the earth by
means of rail-ways, becomes circumscribed as the work draws
towards its close, and their number is consequently diminished
from thirty to twenty- three; they are the property of the con
tractor, and maintained by him.
    From the deep cutting at Muirshearlich through Shangan,
Upper and Lower Banavie, to the chain of eight locks, a space of
two miles, the canal is perfectly finished ; as also from the chain
of locks to the sea entrance at Corpach, about a mile distant,
including therein the two Corpach locks and the bason between
 them and the sea entrance.^
   The whole of the masonry of the five several aqueducts of Loy,
Muirshearlich, Shangan, Upper Banavie, and Lower Banavie,
with the road-ways under each of them, remain as before re
ported, perfect and uninjured by floods or other accidents. The
great chain of locks rising from Corpach Moss, and the two
Corpach locks, require only the addition of lock-gates for their
completion.     The sea-lock, with its gates, which are of wood,
is quite ready for use ; but the coffer-dam which surrounds the
entrance from Loch Eil cannot be removed until the lower gate
of the Corpach locks is hung, the bottom of the platform there
being four feet lower than the level of low water in Loch Eil.
The iron materials for these gates are now daily expected, having
been prepared at Pontcysylte in Denbighshire, and embarked at
 Chester.
    It remains to be mentioned that in the Corpach district we
have caused to be planted at Upper Banavie, at the chain of
locks, and near Corpach, not less than a hundred thousand seed
lings of fir and larch and thirteen thousand young trees in the
present spring ; and we shall not fail to plant the entire banks
of the canal as fast as we acquire means of protecting the young
trees from injuries of every kind.

52         Additional practical Olservations     on the
most dangerous mines in England for nearly five months, during
which time no accident has happened, and no inconvenience oc
curred.
    Since I first published the account of the wire-gauze safe-lamp,
I have made a number of experiments on flame, which have led
to some new philosophical views of this curious and important
subject, and to some practical results, which I hope will be use
ful to the miner : these last will form the subject of the follow
ing pages.
    I find that double cylinders of wire-gauze, so arranged that the
wires are parallel to each other, occasion very little loss of light,
and very much diminish the heat when the fire damp alone is
burning within the cylinder ; so that with double cylinders I have
never observed the wire-gauze to become red hot.         The double
cylinder lamp, therefore, is preferable to the single one, whenever
it is necessary to preserve a light for a long time in a highly ex
plosive atmosphere, and it has likewise twice the strength of the
single cylinder lamp.
   If objections, which have been made, probably by persons who
bad never seen the lamps, against the weakness of the wire, had
really been valid, it would be easy to double the thickness of it,
or to have treble, or even quadruple folds of wire, with bars per
fectly parallel.    Layers of wire-gauze, for instance, of 25, 26,
and 27 apertures to the inch in the cylinder of the common size,
when arranged with a little care, intercept very little more light
than a single layer.
   I have had two lamps made of cylinders of copper perforated
with numerous small, apertures ; but they are more expensive
than cylinders made of copper wire-gauze.
   I have had a lamp made of double wire-gauze with an exterior
copper chimney, which can be raised or lowered, so as to con
sume larger or smaller quantities of fire-damp. This lamp, I find,
may he made to burn in a highly explosive atmosphere without
producing considerable heat, for any length of time ; and it offers
a convenient form of a lamp for destroying the fire damp.
       does not appear, from Mr. Buddie's communications,
     It;                                                        that
the  iron  wire  rusts  in common  use ;  should this be found to be
the  case  in certain   mines, copper wire may be used    ;the addi
tional expense of this material   is  trifling and even wire plated
                                           ;
with silver would not be so costly as to be an object in the price
of the lamp. In the double cylinder lamp, the copper wire will
never become red hot  ;     and
                            I    have had lamps made in which the
inner cylinder was of iron and the outer one of copper wire.

   be   unfounded   ; the carbonaceous matter produced from the de
   composition    of the oil, tends not only to prevent the oxidation of
   the metal, but likewise revives any oxide already formed ; and
   this coaly matter, when the fire-damp is burning- in the lamp,
   choaks the upper apertures of the cylinder, and gradually di
   minishes the heat, by diminishing the quantity of gas consumed.
       In my early inquiries on this subject, I thought that some vi
   treous incombustible composition might be used as a coating to
  prevent the rusting of the wire, and I made some experiments
  on this subject.      I find that a fusible compound of boracic acid
   and the earth called baryta, answers the purpose of a coating
  very well ; and if in any case experience should prove that such
  an application is necessary, it may be easily made.
      It is obvious, that as long as the principle of security (which is
  to admit no aperture in a lamp of more than             of an inch square)
  is preserved, the construction                  almost
                                       may     be          infinitely varied,
  and the fire-damp may be burned throughout the whole of a cy
  linder, or inflamed at certain surfaces only, and the light trans
  mitted from other surfaces through horn, or mica, or glass.                I
  long ago had a lamp made of glass, in which the fire-damp burnt
  round the wick only, from a circular surface of wire-gauze, and
  which, in an explosive mixture, produced very little more heat
  than in the common atmosphere ; but the facility with which
 glass is broken, and horn and mica injured, prevents me from re
 commending any lamps in which these substances are used for
  the common purposes of the miner.
      I have tried a chimney of brass capped with a double wire-
 gauze cylinder, having two-thirds of its circumference opposite
 the flame open, and covered with wire-gauze.                This, in an ex
 plosive     mixture,  produced very    little  heat, though it gave a tole
 rable light, and by increasing the surfaces impermeable, or by di
 minishing those permeable to air, the heat may be reduced in
 any    degree*.
      Whatever construction is adopted, too much attention cannot
 be paid to the form of the screw by which the cylinder or chim
 ney is fastened to the lamp ; it ought to be strong and deep,
 and to consist of at least three turns.
     When the fire-damp is inflamed in the wire-gauze cylinders,
 coal dust thrown into the lamp burns with strong flashes and
     *The Rev. John Hodgson, whose zeni and activity in promoting the ob
jects   of these researches I cannot praise too highly, has had a lamp made
 upon this plan, having a thick plate of glass in a metallic chimney opposite
a wire-gauze feeder, in which the supply of air is regulated by means of a
slider.    I found a model which he sent me to answer very well; the only
objection is, the chance of the glass being broken by a fall, or by a drop of
water when hot.

  54              Additional practical Observations      on the
  scintillations.     It appears that the miners were at first alarmed!
  by an effect of this kind produced by the dust naturally raised
  during the working of the coals. 1 have made a number of ex
  periments on this subject; but though I have repeatedly thrown
  coal dust, powdered rosin, and witch meal, through lamp^ burn
  ing in more explosive mixtures than ever occur in coal mines,
  and though I have kept these substances floating in the explo
  sive atmosphere, and heaped them upon the top of the lamp when
  it was red hot, yet 1 never could communicate explosion by means
  of them.       Phosphorus or sulphur are the only substances which
  can produce explosion by being applied to the outside of the lamp ;
  and sulphur, to produce the effect, must be applied in large quan
  tities and blown upon by a current of fresh air.
      It will be unnecessary to caution the workmen against heap
  ing sulphur, or gunpowder, or pyrites, which afford sulphur by
  distillation, upon their lamps ; and such dust from these sub
  stances as can float in the atmosphere cannot produce inflam
  mation; for minute particles of ignited solid matter have no power
  of inflaming the fire-damp ; and I have repeatedly blown fine
  coal dust mixed with minute quantities of the finest dust of gun
  powder through the lamp burning in explosive mixtures without
  any communication of explosion : and supposing danger with re
  spect to gunpowder, the steel-mill must be much more liable to
  inflame that substance than the wire-gauze lamp : and the dou
  ble cylinder lamp offers perfect security against the inflammation
  of any matter that can ever exist in coal mines.
       In adopting from 30 to 26-apertures to the inch (from 900 to
  676 in the square inch) and wires of from               to ^   of an inch
  in thickness, even single lamps are secure in all atmospheres of
  fire-damp ; and double cylinder lamps are perfectly safe under all
   circumstances even in atmospheres made explosive by coal gas,
  which, from the quantity of olefiantgas it contains, is much more
   inflammable than fire-damp.          When indeed a strong current of
   coal gas is driven from a blow-pipe, so as to make wire-gauze of
   676 apertures strongly red hot in the atmosphere, the flame from
   this pipe may be passed through it whilst it is strongly red hot ;
   but this is owing to the power which wires strongly ignited pos
   sess of inflaming coal gas"'' ; and they have no such effect on ge
   nuine fire-damp ; and a stream of gas burning in the atmosphere
   acting on a small quantity of matter, is entirely different from an
   explosive mixture, which is uniform within the lamp.

 A Letter on the practical Application of the Wire- gauze Safe-
          lamp, from John Buddle, Esq. to Sir H. Davy.
                             Walls-end Colliery, Newcastle,   1st June, 1816.
     Sir, — After having introduced your safety-lamp           into general
 use    in all the collieries under my direction,     where inflammable
 air prevails ; and after using them       daily in every variety of ex
plosive    mixture for upwards of three months,         1 feel the highest
possible gratification in stating      to you, that they have answered
 to my entire satisfaction.
    The safety of the lamps is so easily proved, by taking them into
 any part     of a mine charged with fire-damp, and all the explo
sive gradations of that dangerous element, are so easily and sa
tisfactorily ascertained by their application, as to strike the minds
of the most prejudiced with the strongest conviction of their
high utility ; and our colliers have adopted them with the great
est    eagerness.
     In the practical application of the lamps, scarcely any difficulty
 has occurred.       Those of the ordinary working size, when pre
 pared     with    common    cotton wick and the Greenland whale
oil,   burn   during  the collier's  shift, or day's work of six hours,
without requiring to be replenished ; and the safety trimmer an
 swers the purpose of cleaning,         raising, and lowering the wick
                        '                                          "

     The only hi convenience experienced arises from the great quan
 tity of dust, produced in some situations by working the coal,
 closing up the meshes of the wire gauze, and obscuring the light ;

      application of a small brush.
         We have frequently used the lamps where the explosive mix*
     ture was so high as to heat the wire-gauze red hot ; hut on ex
     amining a lamp which has been in constant use for three months,
     and occasionally subjected to this degree of heat, I cannot per
     ceive that the gauze cylinder of iron wire is at all impaired.         I
     have not, however, thought it prudent, in our present state of
      experience, to persist in using the lamps under such circum*
     stances, because I have observed, that in such situations the par
     ticles of coal dust, floating in the air, fire at the gas burning
     within the cylinder, and    fly off in small luminous sparks.      This
     appearance, I   must confess, alarmed me in the first instance      but           ;
     experience soou proved that        was not dangerous. As
                                       it                              how    it   is,
     ever, possible that some other light combustible substance, ca-
'
     pable of inflaming at   a   red heat, may occasionally float in the
     atmosphere of the mine,     I  have thought      prudent, for the pre-.

                                                the lamps where the gauze
    is  subject to that degree of heat, especially     for a length of time

     at once.
        Our colliers have found  it   mast convenient to. hang the sta
     tionary lamps from small wooden pedestals but on observing,;
     that where the sides of the lamps have been suffered to come in
     contact with the pedestals, the wood        charred to considerable
                                                      is                 a

     and expedition, both the presence, the quantity, and the correct
     situation of the gas.     Instead of creeping inch                  by

    tain fire-damp, in order to ascertain its presence, we walk firmly
     on with the safe lamps, and with the utmost confidence prove
     the actual state of the mine. By observing attentively the several
    appearances upon the flame of the lamp, in an examination of
    this kind, the cause of accidents which have happened to the most
    experienced and cautious miners           completely developed
                                                is                       and        ;
    this has hitherto been, in   a   great measure,   matter  of  mere con
    jecture.

               Wire-gauze Safety lamps             for Miners.               57
 With the safe-lamp, however, it is reduced to the utmost cer
 tainty, the actual presence and position of the gas is not enly>
 ascertained with the greatest precision, but also every alteration
 of circumstance or position is distinctly perceived.
    By placing a lamp near the spot where a quantity of inflam
 mable air is issuing, and mixing with the circulating current of
 atmospherical air to the firing point, it will be seen that very re
mote causes frequently produce pulsations in the atmosphere of
 the mine, which occasion the gas to fire at naked lights ; thus
 showing clearly the instability of the element with which we have
 to deal, and the reason why so many explosions have occurred
where lights have not approached the place where the gas was
lodged within a considerable distance.
    Objections have been made by some who have not had expe
 rience of the lamps, to the delicacy of the wire-gauze, under the
 apprehension      that it may be very soon impaired by the flame
 within the cylinder. Of this, however, I have no reason to com
 plain, as, after three months constant use, the gauze has not, in
 the hands of careful workmen, been perceptibly                injured by the
 action of the flame ; but the outer top gauze of one or two of
 Newman's making has been worn through by the friction of the
 rivet* on the bottom of the swivel, to which the finger ring is
 fastened ; but this only happened to the lamps used by the waste-
men, whose business it is to travel daily in the various avenues of
the mines, for the purpose of keeping the passage for the current
 of air free from obstructions : nothing of the kind has happened
 to the stationary lamps used by the colliers.             In short, I do not
apprehend     that   the gauze      can  be  injured by any ordinary cause,
 without being observed in time sufficient to prevent accidents;
 and that we have no danger to apprehend, except from the gross
negligence of some heedless individual; or an accident               of a very
unusual description occurring to injure the gauze.
    I find that  I   have extended my letter to a greater length than
I intended ; but I trust, Sir,         that you will excuse me for having
gone so much into detail, as           1 feel peculiar satisfaction in dwell- .
ing upon a subject which is of the utmost importance not only to
the great cause of humanity, and to the mining interest of this,
country, but also to the commercial and manufacturing interests
of the United Kingdom : for I feel convinced that by the happy
invention of the safe-lamp, large proportions of the coal mines of
the empire will be rendered available,              which otherwise might
have remained inaccessible — at least without an invention of si
milar utility, it could not have been wrought without much loss
of the nunerak, and risk of life and capital..

   It  is not necessary that    I should enlarge upon the national ad
vantages    which   must  necessarily result from an invention calcu

      Extract of a Letter from Mr. Peile            to Sir H. Davy.
                               Colliery Office, Whitehaven, 6tli July, 1816.
   I take   the liberty of adding a further statement on your invalu
able safe-lamps, in the Whitehaven collieries belonging to the
earl of Lonsdale, since the first application of them in February
last.
   With us, the general use of the lamps in consequence of the
good state of our ventilation is confined to leading workings, or
trial drifts ; and in two of these, lately going on in one of the
pits unusually infected with fire-damp, and which previously were
lighted by means of steel-mills, we applied the lamps with great
confidence and security.
   In May last in these drifts an extraordinary discharge of fire
damp burst from the pavement of the mine, and the ventilation
being at that time unavoidably obstructed, the atmosphere be
came so charged with fire-damp as to be nearly throughout an
explosive mixture.       In this situation we derived the unspeakable
benefit of light from the lamps, and, notwithstanding the explo
sive state of the mixture, with the most perfect safety.
   In several other places in the collieries the lamps are used with
the same confidence : yet the discharge of fire-damp being mo
derate, they are not much exposed to explosive mixtures.
   In all the workings showing the least appearance of fire-damp,
the miners are supplied with lamps, and are particularly cau
tioned to use them on first entering when beginning to work,
where, being satisfied of security, they occasionally resort to can
dles afterwards.      This application of the lamp alone, is of the
greatest utility, and prevents many slight explosions, and the
miners from being burned ; besides superseding the necessity of
depending on the judgement or discrimination of any individual
to prove the existence of the fire-damp, as in the old method, by
the candle flame.
   From the repeated proofs made with the lamps, we cannot too
strongly express our confidence in their security.
   By experiment, a pint of oil, value six-pence, will about sup
                                                                         ply

  If    my humble testimony can in any degree promote the speedy
use    of the lamp in other places,   will give me great pleasure.

                                                     is

Bessel, of Konigsberg, of which the prospectus           inclosed.             is               I
am willing to hope that an undertaking so essential for the ad
vancement of astronomy will be particularly encouraged in En

                            it   is
your incomparable countryman Bradley.          According to the pre
sent course of exchange, the price of the book will not exceed
about     guinea and

sufficient number of subscribers shall be found to afford a rea
sonable prospect of the repayment of the expenses.
 I   discovered    acomet last year on the 6th of March, and gave
immediate notice of the discovery to Dr. Herschel, as well as in
the public papers.     This comet was observed in Germany until
the 25th of August      and
                        ;         very remarkable for the shortness
                                      it   is
of  the period of its revolution.     Several of our astronomers,
and in particular Mr. Nicolai,     now  Director of the Observatory
of Manheim, have calculated its motions in an elliptical orbit                                   ;
and the 'results of their calculations agree extremely well with
each other     ;but none of them has exhibited greater diligence
and address in the inquiry than Professor Bessel. These are his
elements, determined for the 26th April 1815                               :

    The longitude of the ascending node is calculated from the
mean place of the equinoctial point on the 1st Jan. 1815 j and
the inclination relates to the plane of the ecliptic at the same
time.    In this determination the perturbations derived from the
action of .the planets, during the time that the comet remained
visible, have been taken into the calculation ; and it is derived
from a comparison of nearly 200 observations. According to the
doctrine of chances, it is probable that the error of the time of
revolution does not exceed +^ "27657 of a year, or about 101
days.
   The indefatigable Bessel has also calculated the perturbations
which this comet will undergo before its next return.     Accord
ing to its regular elements it ought to come again to the perihe
lion on the 14th May 1889; but, on account of the perturba
tions, this event will take place S24 51 days earlier, that     on                is,
 the 9th February 1887 consequently our successors may expect
                             ;
 its return three or four months before or after the 9th February
 1887.
     If this comet should have been accurately observed in En
gland, you will much oblige me             by
                                        sending me the particulars of
the observations.      In France      has not been done with much
                                      it
precision    ; and we have only been able to obtain, in addition to
the German observations, some which have been made in Russia
and   in  the north of Italy,
     In the first part of the Philpsophical Transactions for 1814                        is
an excellent essay      byyour great mathematician Mr. Ivory, who
is   also so much esteemed in this country           entitled " On a
                                                         ;   it   is
New Method of deducing          first Approximation to the Orbit of
                                 a

semblance between this method and that which             myself pub   I
lished some years ago, and which has since that time been much
used on the Continent; and the coincidence was the more in
teresting, as Mr. Ivory obtained the same solution, from his                            al
gebraical investigation, which       had deduced from

quadrant,      from    2000 observations of Bradley, exactly a second
greater than Pond makes that of his circle ; and it is natural to
inquire whether a part of the difference may not depend on the
different situation of the instruments.

    Professor Bessel 's work will be entitled Fundamenla Astro-
nomue pro Anno 1755, deducta ex Observationibus Viri incom-
parabilis J. Bradley.              It is the result of the labour of seveu
 whole years, and contains a number of determinations of the ut
 most importance to astronomy. JVhe extreme accuracy of Brad
 ley's methods of observing, combined with the excellence of his
 instruments, made it possible for him to attain a degree of pre
 cision, which is of so much the more value, as half a century is
now elapsed since the period to which they relate.              All the ele
ments which have any influence on astronomical observations are
 here deduced from Bradley's observations alone.
    The sections of the work are these: I. Examination of the
 instruments, and of their corrections.             II. Observations of the
equinox.      III. Latitude of Greenwich. IV. Refraction. V. Ap
plication of the latitude and refraction to the observations of the
solstice and the equinox.             VI. Examination of the old mural
quadrant    :   law   of  its variation  : new examination     of right as
censions.        VII.   General and special tables of aberration and
nutation.        VIII. Register of the clock from 1750 to 1762.
 IX. Annual parallax of some of the fixed stars : constant multi
plier for aberration.          X." Catalogue of all the stars observed by
Bradley;      3166     which     are found in later catalogues, and 108
observed but once, and not elsewhere noticed; some of which
may possibly have been planets, but the Georgian planet occur*
but once among them.

 Proper motion of the fixed stars.           XIII. Comparison of the re
sults with other observations.
    The work is written in Latin, and will contain about 400
 pages in folio : the price to subscribers will be ten dollars, con
 ventional currency, to be paid on delivery.            The only reason for
soliciting a subscription is to contribute to the advancement of
 science.     The author would readily have renounced all hopes of
 remuneration for his labours ; but so little encouragement is
 given in Germany to works of the kind, that no bookseller
 eould be found to undertake the expenses of the publication1.             A
 hundred subscribers will be sufficient to enable the author to
 meet these expenses ; and their names will he published as be
 nefactors' to the science of astronomy.

Remarks on the      Art of making Wine     ; with Suggestions  for  the
    Application of    its Principles to the Improvement of domestic
     Wines. By John       MacCulloch, M.D. Longman, pp.261.
     12mo.
D R. MacCulloch's name            as an author in the sciences of che
mistry and mineralogy is deservedly in high estimation, and he
has added considerably to his reputation by the above publica
tion. It is a practical treatise on a subject which is likely to be
come daily of more interest in this country, and it has been an
object of peculiar attention with the Caledonian Horticultural So
ciety, who have the merit of being perhaps the first public body
which has awarded premiums for the best specimens of British
wines.
     Dr. MacCulloch's ideas were first thrown into the form of a
memoir for the Transactions of the above Society, and the en
couragement they received in that shape induced him to ex
 tend his researches, and to compose a useful portable volume on
the subject.       The author's treatise is quite practical : the im
 provements in modern chemistry have enabled him triumphantly
to explode the gross errors which had crept into most of our fa
 mily receipt-books for making wines.          On the subject of the
absurd and deleterious practice of adding alcohol or brandy
 to home-made and foreign wines, professedly to make them
keep longer ; but in reality to render them more palatable to the
depraved appetites of English wine-drinkers, the author is pecu
liarly happy.      Alluding to the undefinable light and quick fla
 vour so characteristic of the French wines, and so opposite to the
mawkish, dull and heavy taste of the wines of Spain and Portugal
 (particularly that called Port), imported into this country, Dr.
 MacCulloch ascribes the wretched taste and bad effects of the
 latter to the admixture of brandy or spirits. We shall select
 this part of the work, as being a specimen of its real value, and
 as likely to be useful both to the consumers and makers of wines
 in, this country.
     <e
        This practice^ (that of mixing brandy or alcohol with wine),
 universal in the wines of Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, which are
 intended for the English market, has also been introduced into
 our domestic wines, under the mistaken notion of preventing
                                                                  them

them from turning sour, and with the idea that it enabled them
to keep for a longer tiirie. As this is a question of some im
portance, both as it regards the perfection and the ceconomy of
our domestic manufacture, I shall make no apology for entering
somewhat largely into it.
     " It had been long thought, from the vain attempts of che
mists to separate the alcohol which is a constituent part of wine
by other chemical processes than distillation, that this substance
existed in  it,  either in    far different condition from that in which
                               a
we know    it   when in its separate state, or that the intoxicating
substance contained in wine was not alcohol.                This opinion ap
pears to have originated with Rouelle, who imagined that alco
 hol was not completely formed until the temperature was raised
 to the point of distillation.       More lately the same doctrine was
 revived and promulgated              Fabbroni in the Memoirs of the
                                     by
 Florentine Academy.         His opinion was founded on the following
 experiment.       When alcohol         added to new wine, he observed
                                        is
 that he could         the introduction of subcarbonate of potash in
                       by
 sufficient quantity separate the added alcohol, while the spirit of
 the wine remained attached to             as before these additions, and
                                             it
 could only be obtained            by
                                   subjecting       to distillation.
                                                    it                 Hence
 he concluded, that the alcohol was formed               by
                                                          the action of heat
 on the elements of wine, or that           wasit  product of distillation.
                                                    a
      " But the experiment was not attended with similar results in
 the hands of other chemists, unless in cases where the added             al
  cohol bore    a   very considerable proportion to the wine, and          it
  consequently left the question respecting the formation of alcohol
 in    wine in the same state as before.          need not point out the
                                                    I
  laxity  so  apparent   in Fabbroni's    reasonings, as      itwould lead to
  discussions too minute     for this essay.    But   the  attention  of other
  chemists has been excited towards the same object, and con
  clusions the reverse of his have been the consequence.            If    sub-
  acetate of lead be added to wine, and the clear liquor be then
   saturated with subcarbonate of potash, the alcohol will be se
   parated. It    also appears from the experiments of Gay Lussac
   that alcohol can be separated from wine               by
                                                          distillation at the
   temperature of 66, and indeed from the trials of Fabbroni him

  the other ingredients which enter into that compound fluid* Al
  though therefore alcohol is ascertained to exist ready formed in
 all wines, so much of the experiment of Fabbroni is still true as
 to be an object of utility in the subject we are now examining ;
 while the conclusions to be drawn from it appear of importance
 in explaining the different effects of simple wines and wines with
 which brandy has been mixed.         It is presuming much too far
 on our chemical knowledge to imagine that we are acquainted
 with the nature of alcohol.     It is possibly subject to varieties of
 composition, analogous to those which are found in the very va
 riable substances included under carburetted hydrogen gas, and
 which, although they have not been appreciated by chemical
  actions, merely peihaps because the subject has been supposed
 to be already understood, and the substance itself imagined to be
 in all cases chemically identical, may be ascertained hereafter
 by more refmed experiments in the hands of acuter chemists, to
 whom this subject is here pointed out as calling for investiga
 tion. It is otherwise impossible to understand the differences
 which appear in its effects on the nervous svstem when taken
 into the stomach under its different forms.       Where its specific
 gravity, and consequently its imagined condition, is in different
 specimens absolutely equal, yet these specimens, produced un
 der different circumstances, operate on the nervous system in a
 manner so totally different as to point out some radieal differences
 of which specific gravity is no criterion. The comparative ef
fects of new and of old rum, of equal proof, of Dutch gin and
 of diluted alcohol of equal strength, are too well known to re
 quire more than a bare mention.          It has been supposed; for
 want of better means of explaining these effects, that they were
due to the essential oil contained in the different varieties of
 spirits used as beverage.    But of these we know nothing. We
are sure that they are in very trifling quantity, since they eannot
be separated by water, except in the single case of gin, where a
foreign oil is purposely introduced.      Neither are we acquainted
with any oils of this class whose qualities are deleterious, except
that of the bitter kernels, their analogous kindred laurel, and
a few other bitter vegetables, whose poisonous qualities besides
appear to be subject to no modifications, being, where not
deadly, almost unproductive of any effects.     Moreover that spirit,
alcohol, from which by careful rectification        the essential oil
seems to have been most carefully removed, is more injurious
than those which like rum and brandy are knowu to contain it.
    " Dilution does not remove the injurious effec ts of these noxious
spirits.   When spirit of any sort is mixed with water it requires
some little time, to effect the union of the two substances. They
ultimately become coaibined.       Yet the effect of the one kind of

spirit, although combined   with water, is still different from that
of the other on the human    body.  They are both very different
from     that of pure wine in which either chemical reagents or
distillation    have ascertained preciselv the same proportion of al
cohol.      In other words, the same quantity of alcohol applied to
the stomach under the form of natural wine, and in a state of
mere combination         with water, is productive of effects on the
 body,   not   only immediately but ultimately attended with consi
derable differences. These are well known to physicians. They are
equally well known to those whose habits of observation either on
themselves or others have led them to compare the moral effects,
if we may so term them, produced by intoxication with different
wines, with champagne and claret, or with port and sherry, the
elevation of thought produced by the former^ with the sedative
eii'ects of the latter ; or who have had an opportunity of wit
nessing the stupidity produced by ale and the ferocity which re
sults from intoxication with spirits.          The nervous system is here
a test of differences which elude the ordinary resources of che
mistry.       Yet the reagents which have been applied to the in
vestigation of these differences, although they have done little,
still show that some chemical distinctions may really exist.                It
has been perhaps hastily said of Fabbroni's            experiment, that it
was useless since it produced no consistent results.           On the con
trary   it appears   to be  a test applicable   to some   of the least tena
cious combinations        of  alcohol, and the censure unjustly passed
on it has originated in want of attention to the subject, and to
those delicate circumstances in the combinations of alcohol, on
which its various effects, as it exists in wine and other potable
liquors, depend.        Could we discover an additional number of
such reagents differing in their various powers of separating the
different combinations         under which it is found, I have little
doubt that chemical means would shortly illustrate, by corre
sponding differences of effect, the different powers which these
beverages exert on the nervous system.                The experiment of
Fabbroni is perfectly valid to a certain extent, and the causes of
the supposed irregular results appear to be abundantly obvious.
If alcohol be mixed with water in any proportion, it may be se
parated by carbonat of potash .          If it be mixed with wine in the
same manner, it     is,  with due attention and in particular circum
stances, equally separable.         Butif     an attempt be made to se
parate the adventitious alcohol from those wines to which             it  has
been added     by   the manufacturer, the experiment will sometimes
succeed and sometimes fail.          The cause  is   mentioned in various
parts of this essay, and      is    apparently this.   If    the alcohol or
brandy     be  added   before  the fermentation    of the  wine,  or at some
subsequent stage when that fermentation              can  be  artificially re-

excited,   it then enters either entirely or partially into a more
perfect   combination   with the wine than that which it forms after
a mere admixture ; or a portion of it at least, proportioned        to
the degree of fermentation which takes place after       its addition,
becomes thus combined.         Here the toot indicated by Fabbroni
fails, although reagents of higher powers are still capable of ef
fecting the separation.     In all such cases the wine is impeifectly-
vinous, the brandy being almost always sensible to delicate pa
lates, and its effects on the stomach are proportionally injurious.
The test is therefore of real use in ascertaining the correct fabri
cation of those wines to which brandy is added, and it will in
variably be found that the worst wines of the growth of Portugal
and Spain are those which are the moht sensible to             it,
                                                           or in other
words, those which contain the greatest quantity of uncombincd
alcohol.      But to return to the consequences which arise in the
liquor itself from the admixture of alcohol.           It    decomposes the
wine.     However slow the effects of this decomposition may ap
 pear, they are not the Ie^s certain.              The first and most con
spicuous   effect,      the
                       is    loss of  that   undefmable   lively or brisk fla
vour which all those who possess accuracy of taste can discover
in  French wines, or          natural wines; and a flatness, which must
                             in
be sensible,      by the principle of contrast, to the dullest palate
which shall compare the taste of claret with that of port, or that
of hock or grave with lisbon or bucellos.           It    tends equally, al
though   in   a  greater length    of  time,   to  destroy the union of the
colouring principle,      which    is well  known to be deposited in port
w"nes, and apparently, in a great measure, from the action- of
this foreign substance.            may not be useless at the same time
                                  It
to consider the influence which         it  must have on the quality of the
wine as     a   beverage.      The  habitual    use of wine containing, as
many    of  tiie  wines   of   Portugal    so  often do,a    large portion of
brandy,    must     be  manifestly equivalent to the habitual use of
spirits, or rather, to the use of spirits and wine together.                TV
this cause we may doubtleis attribute the great difference fn the
effects produced        by
                         an immoderate indulgence        in   port and sherry,
or
     by
     a    similar use of claret and other French wines.               Even the
immediate effects are sensibly different, as        I      have said before,
and the transitory nature of the one with the permanence of the
other are too well known to be insisted on.                 But the ultimate
consequences appear to be of            a more serious nature.          It well

Ss   doubtless to be attributed the excessive and increasing preva
lence    of hepatic affections, diseases comparatively little known
to our continental neighbours.        It is sufficient to have touched
on this most important subject, on which the proposed limits of
the present essay will not allow me to dwell.          It is more to my
present purpose to show, that the use of brandy in the manu

facture of wine is founded on a mistaken principle.               Having
shown that it is injurious to wine in general, by destroying its
liveliness and hastening its decomposition,          I might strengthen
this assertion by mentioning      that it is not used in any of the
wines of France or Germany, and that the fmer wines, claret,
burgundy, and hock, are totally destroyed by it.            But it is also
proper to point out its insufficiency for producing the effects ex
pected from it, the preservation of the wine, and the retardation
of the acetous process. The former parts of this essay having
fully explained the nature both of the vinous and of the acetous
fermentation, I need not here again describe them, except to re
mind the reader, that the acetous process cannot take place
while there exists between the leaven and the sugar a dispropor
tion in favour of the latter, and that the fermentation cannot be
re-excited if the leaven has been entirely separated by the usual
processes of racking, fining, and sulphuring,           should even the
sugar   have  disappeared.     Such  wine   can  therefore  have no ten
dency to vinegar, and the addition of brandy if intended to pre
vent that effect is at least superfluous.       It is now to be inquired
whether brandy has any power to prevent the acetous process
from taking place, supposing that the circumstances favourable
to it are present.     If brandy in small quantity be introduced into
vinegar during     the  acetous stage of fermentation, the process
goes on as before, and the alcohol is acetified, the produce be
coming a stronger vinegar.        This has indeed been lately denied
by Mr. Cadet, in whose hands the addition of alcohol in small
quantities appears to have had no effect on the acetous process.
From his experiments it would also appear that the addition of
alcohol in a quantity exceeding 1 - 17th of the fluid suspends the
acetification.     In the state of ignorance in which we are re
specting the chemical nature of that process, it does not appear
easy to reconcile these contradictory        experiments.     Admitting
that the experiments of Mr. Cadet are unexceptionable, it remains
certain that wine can be, as it daily      is, brought into the acetous
fermentation      by proper treatment or under certain natural cir
cumstances, although containing        a  far greater proportion of   al
cohol than that which appeared to him sufficient to suspend the
process.   "fifes' certainly possible that the state of combination
above described, in which the alcohol exists in the wine, may,

ready commenced may be sufficient to account for        the  difference,
the same alcohol applied before the commencement of the pro
cess being susceptible of the incipient changes, and being thus
ultimately capable of entering into the final ones in common
with the rest of the fluid.      But this subject     yet obscure.

 correct and varied repetition of these experiments       would   be ne
 cessarv to render this subject thoroughly intelligible, and they
 may be added to the general list of desiderata in this depart
 ment of chemistry which have already been enumerated.
    " must therefore proceed in the examination of this subject
       I
 on the basis of former experience, omitting any exceptions to be
 drawn from these experiments, as being for the present incapable
 of application     the more so that they do not appear strictly ap

 the acetous process establishes itself speedily, and the produce
is   vinegar.     We have here then ample proof that brandy, in
 these cases, so far from checking the acetous process, increases
 it, and therefore, that its use, as preservative to wine,

 in error.      have dwelt the more on this subject because this
                I
 view     opposed to all popular opinions and practices, opinions
          is
 most assuredly founded on erroneous and vague analogies, drawn
 from some supposed preservative power residing in spirits.               I
 am the more particular in calling to this subject the attention

June 27. —   Sir    E. Homk furnished a supplement to his former
paper   on  the   structure  of the feet of animals which have pro-?
gressivc   motion    contrary to the action of gravity.        Mr. Bauer

of the feet of such animals, Sir E. lias thus been enabled to correct
his former observations, and even to extend them to insects.            It
appears that many of these animals have from one to three
suckers on each foot, which, making a vacuum, enable the ani
mal to proceed securely along a cieling with its back towards the

their fall from long leaps. On examining the structure of the
flea's feet no balls were discovered, as this insect's body          is so
light  as not  to  require  them.   Sir  E. thinks  that   this structure,
of the feet of insects must furnish a new and important basis of
the classification of insects ;   and he anticipates great advantage
to science from the researches and discoveries of Dr. Leach, of
the British Museum, in this department of natural history.

             J.                                    paper on the means
                                                   a
of arresting or destroying the contagion of the plague,             byDr.
Bernardo Antonio Gomez.           The Portuguese government being
anxious to prevent the plague from entering Portugal, encouraged
Dr. Gomez to make some experiments, chiefly with the view of
ascertaining whether the common methods of fumigating letter*,
or immersing them in vinegar,         ifreceived from countries where
the plague was supposed to exist, were sufficient to destroy any
contagious matter which might adhere to them.               Dr. G. pro
ceeded to examine the effects of fumigating           sealed letter with
                                                       a
chlorine, having first made two or three longitudinal cuts in it;
and the result proved that such fumigation           must be perfectly
sufficient, as every part of the letter retained the odour of the
gas, which was even stronger      a  day or two after than at the time.
He next made some experiments with vinegar, which, as well as
the chlorine, changed the colour of the ink. He related the re
sult of more than 22 experiments made with sulphuric, muriatic,
and nitric acids, with burning sulphur and nitre together, &c.
In order to ascertain the effects of these different acids, he
caused letters to be impregnated with the odour of putrid flesh,
which he found that they expelled completely           but the chlorine
                                                       ;
he considered as the best and most efficacious of these applica
tions, even should the letters not be cut or perforated,         The i"u-

     On the Analysis   of Sea Water   ;  by Dr. Murray. In this paper    -
 the   result is given  of an analysis of a salt formed in the large
 wry from the brine of sea water, and which seems hitherto to have
 escaped observation. It is a sulphate of magnesia and soda, cry
stallized in very regular rhombs, but sometimes with truncated
 edges and angles.      It contain? considerably less water of crystal
lization than either sulphate of soda or sulphate of magnesia-, is
 less nauseous, and differs in other properties.   It has not been ap
 plied to use, but may perhaps be employed a< a purgative. Dr.
 Murray has also furnished a paper containing a general formula
 for the analysis of mineral waters, the object of which is to give
 one method applicable to the analvsis of all waters, instead c;f
 tiie various methods before employed.
     On the Ancient Geography of Central and Eastern Asia, with
 illustrations derived from recent discoveries iu South India; by
 'Mr. Hugh Murray.        The author conceives that the ancients knew
 more respecting this quarter of the world than is generally sup
 posed. The modern discovery respecting the course of the rivers
of the Punjab, and their junction before falling into the Indu%
 only restores Ptolomy's map of these rivers. He endeavours, and
with an appearance of some success, to show that Ptolomy's
 statements, carefully analysed, give a pretty correct outline of
central and eastern Asia; and that the prevailing systems of
d'Anville, Gosselin, &c. are founded on an undue contempt of
ancient authorities, and some delusive resemblances of. name.
     Dr. Brewster ha- furnished papers — on a new optical and mi-
ucralogical property of Calcareous Spar ; and on the communi
cation of double Refraction to Glass and other substances thu;
refract singly, by mechanical compression and dilatation ; and i.

alluded to, he mentions that he has found that water exists in ni

                          MAI.LHABf.E 1'LATINA.
 It*   the Journal of Science and Art, published at Florence, the
  Marquis Ridolfi has given a new process for purifying platina.
 Having observed the fact that no person had been able to com
 bine sulphur with platina, he conceived the idea that, by con
 verting all the other metals found in crude platina into sulphn-
 rets, it would be easy to purify that metal.      His process is very
 simple.     He  first separates  from  the crude platina some of the
 extraneous    substances   usually mixed with it, and washes the re
  mainder with nitro-muriatic acid diluted with four times its
  weight of water.      He then melts it with half its weight of pure
  lead, throws it into cold water, and thus obtains ?n allov, which
  he pulverizes, mixes with an equal portion of sulphur, and throws
  into a white-hot Hessian crucible ; covers the crucible instantlv,
  and keeps it in an intense hea't for ten minutes.     AVhen cold, a
  brittle metallic button, composed of platina, lead and sulphur, is
  found beneath the scoria.         This button he fuses with a small
  addition of lead: the sulphur separates itself with fresh scoria,
  and there remains only an alloy of platina and lead.       This alloy
  he heats to whiteness, and in that state beats it with a hot ham
  mer on a hot anvil, which forces out the lead in fusion.       If the
  alloy be not at a white heat when beat, it will break.      The pla
  tina thus obtained is ductile, malleable, and as tenacious as that
  obtained from the ammoniacal muriate.          He was able to make
                                                                   wire

    gravity was 22*630.                                                                       .    .
       In repeating the process different times he did not always find
i   the platina in one lump at the bottom of the crucible.            was                     It
    sometimes scattered in globules among the dross.         In this case
    he treats the mass with     little diluted sulphuric acid the glo

    bules are soon liberated from the dross, and sink to the bottom
    of the crucible.   They are then to be collected and washed, and
    submitted to the same -operation of the hammer as         the platina           if
    had been found in one button with the lead.

    James Sibbald, on their late passage to Calcutta — " On the 1st             :
    October, our latitude at noon was 13° 25' S. longitude S4° E.;
    we observed       quantities of stuff floating on the surface of the
    water, which had to us the appearance of sea-weed — but we
    were quite astonished to find          burnt cinders, evidently volcanic.

acquiring land, bv purchase of the natives, at a very low price ;
and has therefore recommended that extensive purchases should
be made with a view to convert the same into plantations of cot
ton and coffee, and that he has already made considerable pro
gress in clearing the laud of wood, tkc.        The general further
states, that the river Ancobar is navigable as far as the centre of
the Dinkiva country, the first province of the king of Ashantce j
and he adds, that it is certain this river was navigable in the
time of Bosnian.       The general then refers to ancient Dutch
maps, copied     from   the Portuguese, to show that formerly the
Portuguese    had  several establishments on the Ancobar, at which
were convents of monks and christian churches, above 40 leagues
in the interior of the country.     The general suggests, that were
the British and Dutch to agree to establish forts on each side of
the viver, with the consent of the king of Ashantee, not only
i.iight the whole commerce of that country be attracted, but al;>o
that of the country on this side of Long Mountains. The ex
pense of such a project to the two governments, the general
thinks, would not exceed 10,000/. sterling, as he conceives the
king of Ashantee would supply a number of workmen to carry
wood, stones, aud lime, of which there is an abundance in the
neighbourhood.                .

     We have again to record an instance of culpable negligence
followed by a most melancholy result, in the explosion of a steam-
boiler by loading its safefv-valve so as to prevent the possibility
of the steam escaping.          The load on the lever of the safety-
valve was slipped to its outer extremity,      and left to itself. We
need only remark that the lever should never be of such a length,
or, vice versa, the weight so heavy as to occasion the least dan
ger when placed furthest from the valve.           fn other words, no
weight should ever be used that can by any accidental change
 prevent the steam from lifting the valve whenever it acquires a
 certain measured power.

     Horbid AcciDKNT.-^-We          have a painful duty to perform,
 in recording an unparalleled scene of human misery and anguish
 which occurred on board the steam-boat Washington, Jately built
 at Wheeling,       (Va.) and commanded by Capt. fchreve. She
 started from Wheeling on Monday last, and arrived at this place
 on Tuesday       evening following at about 7 o'clock, and safely
 came to anchor opposite Point Manner, where she continued until
 Wednesday morning.          The fires had been kindled and the boilers
  sufficiently hot, preparatory to her departure, when the anchor
  was weighed and the helm put to larboard, in order to wear her
  and place her in a position to start her machinery ; but having
  only one of her rudders shipped at the time, its influence was not
  sufficient to have the desired effect, and she shot over under the
  Virginia shore, where it was found expedient to throw over the
  kedge at her stern to effect it.
      This being accomplished, the crew were then required to haul
  it again on board, and were nearly all collected on the quarter
  for that purpose.      At this unhappy, fatal moment, the end of
  the cylinder     towards the stern exploded, and threw the whole
  contents of hot water among them, and spread death and torture
   in every direction.     The captain, mate, and several others were
  Knocked overboard, but were saved (with the exception of one
  man, who is still missing,) by boats from the town, and by swittir
  If'ifig tP the Virginia shore,                     *

 76 Death    of M. Guy ton   de   Morveun. — Late Rainy Weather.
    The whole town was alarmed by the explosion ; every physi
 cian, with a number of the citizens, went immediately to their
 relief.   On going on board, a melancholy and really horrible
 scene presented itself to view — six or eight were nearly skinned
 from head to foot, and others slightly scalded, making, in the
 whole, seventeen.     In stripping off their clothes the skin pealed
 off with them to a considerable depth : added to this melancholy
 sight, the ear of the pitying spectator was pierced by the screams
 and groans of the agonizing sufferers, rendering the scene horri
 ble beyond description.
     The cause of this melancholy catastrophe may be accounted
 for, by the cylinder not having vent through the safety-valve, which
 was firmly stopped by the weight which hung on the lever having
 been unfortunately slipped to its extreme, without being noticed,
 and the length of time occupied in wearing before her machinery
 could be set in motion, whereby the force of the steam would
 have been expended- — these two causes united, confined the
 steam till the strength of the cylinder could no longer contain
 it, andit  gave way with the greatest violence.
    The steam-boat was warped across the river and safelv moored
 in deep water at Point Harmar, where       it   is probable she will
 stay several weeks, till her boiler can be repaired.
    As her cylinders were all on deck, the boat has received no
 material injury from the explosion.
     By this accident 1 9 people were wounded  ;   9 of them slightly,
  10 so severely that 6  are since dead, and one man    is missing.
     M. Guyton de Morveau, the celebrated French chemist, died
  at Paris in January last.     He was born at Dijon in 1/37, and
 "educated to the French bar: he held the office of advocate ge
  neral to the parliament of Dijon for twenty-two years.    Having
a   turn for the sciences, and particularly chemistry, Guvton de
  Morveau in 1776 founded a lectureship on chemistry, minera
  logy, and materia medica, and gave the course himself for thir
  teen years.    After publishing his nomenclature he was invited
'to Paris, and made a member of the Institute.       His most suc
  cessful discovery was that of fumigating infected places.
                    THE LATE RAINY WEATHER.
    In Yorkshire,   as appears   by
                                the subjoined letter, the effects of
the late rains are not considered as likely to be disastrous.
                                             York, 27th July, 18)6.
   We have accounts from different parts of this kingdom, as
well as from the continent, that the quantity of rain lias been
excessiye, and the thunder-storms unusually heavy.        There has
not however been, with us,       greater quantity of rain than

usual at this season — the showers,          though more frequent, have
been less    violent than in hot summers, and not a single thunder
storm has passed over this city.         The spring was unusually dry;
down to the end of June the country was greatly in want of rain ;
and it was actually prayed for in churches so lately as the 30th
of June.       The showers which have fallen during the present
month have not exceeded the supply which the country needed;
nor have they yet injured the hay, except in some low grounds ;
but they have doubtless retarded the commencement of the hay
harvest, and even -prevented any hay from being got.            We sub
join a statement, in inches and tenths of an inch, of the rain
 fallen during the three summer months for the last six years.

XXI. On Sir H. Davy's Safe-Lamp.      By Dr. Ure, M.D.
            Professor of Chemistry, &c. &c.
                            To   Mr. Tilloch.
Dear      Sir, — Permit      me to join my voice, to the decisive testi
monies     already published, in favour of Sir H. Davy's safety-lamp.
I   waslately present at several experiments, which place in a con
spicuous   view, its wonderful power of giving protection against
the explosion of fire-damp, so often fatal to the miner.
                                                              During
a visit which I paid a few weeks ago to Dublin, ;ny ingenious
friend Richard Griffith esq. mining-engineer to the Dublin So
ciety, requested my assistance in preparing and exhibiting some
experimental illustrations of the lamp, for his deservedly popular
course of lectures on geology.       Two lamps were tried.       The
cage of one was formed of iron-wire, each mesh being l-20th
of au inch in width ; — the other cage was of copper-wire,         its
meshes were each about 1 -30th of an inch wide.          A table with
raised edges, painted so as to hold water, and a large glass re
ceiver of the capacity of a cubic foot and a half were provided :
the water was about an inch and a half in depth.
    Things being in this state, a glass syphon was introduced un
der the edge of the receiver, and the atmospherical air was sucked
out till the water rose within, to a certain mark, corresponding
to a known ratio of the whole volume.       A gasometer filled with
the compound combustible gas obtained from acetate of potash
by heat, was connected by a flexible pipe, with a brass tube which
was fixed tight in an aperture made through the table under the
receiver, and gas was slowly introduced into        it,
                                                   till the water was
 again displaced.
    Various proportions    of air and gas were used in different
experiments.      When the lamp with its cage screwed on, was
introduced into the receiver containing eleven parts of atmo
spherical air and one of carburetted hydrogen, the flame en
larged, but continued moderate and of a blue lambent appear
ance.    When six parts of air and one of gas were used, the
flame was more vivid, filling the whole cage   and when the com
                                                ;
bustible gas constituted l-5th of      the whole,   the flame of the
wick was extinguished very soon after the lamp was introduced,
hut the gas continued to burn with great violence withm the
cage, and its wire became distinctly red hot     :yet the flame did
not communicate through the meshes, so as to kindle the large
volume of combustible gas            by
                                   which the lamp was enveloped.
At the end of the experiment the cage was found to be distorted,
from its free expansion being counteracted        by
                                                  the strong parallel
wires that constitute the exterior frame, and which serve to
connect the metal plate at top with the body of the lamp below.
    Vol. 48.   No. 220. August 1816.                F           Similar

82                 On   Sir H. Davy's Safe-Lamp.
Similar experiments           were made, with the gas obtained by ex*
posing    charcoal,     in  an  ignited iron tube, to the action of steam.
This, being      mixed     in  the  above proportions with atmospherical
air, exhibited «early the same phenomena, only the flame was
much fainter.          It is probable that the fire-damp of mines, re
sembles this species most nearly, being, like            it,   produced    by the
action of water, on carbonaceous matter.
   Coal gas was afterwards tried.              With l-12th of    it   in the re
ceiver, the lamp burned very vividly             ;  but when   it    constituted
1 -7th of the whole contents of the receiver, the ignition became
furious, verging on a white heat.                In one experiment of this
kind the violent expansion of the included gas, forced up the
receiver suddenly from the flat surface of the table, and gave an
appearance of explosion       :      but when free egress to the water was
given     by  resting   the  under    edge of the receiver on three slips of
wood, no explosive sound could be perceived, though the com
bustion was exceedingly intense         :   it  was evidently afi confined to
the wire cylinder.          The receiver in these last experiments vi
brated loudly, emitting tremulous musical tones.                 These mixtures
of coal gas possess an explosive force incomparably greater than
any native fire-damp; for the gas was procured from cannel coal,
and therefore contained a considerable quantity of olefiant gas,
which    I believe is    never present in coal-mines.
   After these experiments with the lamp had been exhibited,
to the great satisfaction of a crowded and highly respect
able audience, another of          a       simpler, though perhaps         a still
more instructive kind was performed.                 A  flat slip of wire-cloth
about six inches square, having meshes of the same size with
the cylinder of the lamp, was held at                a little distance before a.
gasometer-pipe,        from    which    issued
                                             a    copious stream of unmixed
coal-gas.      A   lighted candle       was  then placed on the other side
of the sieve-cloth, and the gas as          it  passed through the meshes
immediately kindled but in no position, either horizontal, verti
                          ;
cal, or inclined, would the flame communicate through the in
terstices, so as to set fire to the gas flowing from the pipe on the
other side of the wire.            The converse of this was shown, bv
kindling     the  effluent   gas  at  the pipe; and on presenting the gauze
plate,  a  part   of  the  gas passed through unconsumed.
    It   is impossible to conjecture, to what new philosophical
researches, this singular phaenomenon may lead.                      The lamp,
though simple        in      structure, is     as marvellous in its func
tions, as the storied lamp of Aladdin, realizing its fabled
powers of conducting in safety through " fiends of combustion,"
to the hidden treasures of the earth.            If   we consider how much
the contmental energies of Great Rritain depend on its fuel,                    it
will be hard to name a public recompense too great for this
purely scientific invention of our illustrious chemist, which ren

so that when it is worked with the

the wick may be readily trimmed
 without unscrewing the cage.

 XXII. A Letter         to the   Dublin Society, relative to Experiments
    on  Wheel-carriages.            By Rich. Lovei.l EdgewortHjEj^.
 To the Committee
                         of Natural Philosophy of the Dublin Society.
 Gentlemen,        —  I have       the honour to return to you a Report
 of the   experiments       tried by me, under your directions, at the
            '  ''                       F 2                         latter

84                  A Letter lo   the  Dullin    Society
latter   end of last May; to which I beg leave to subjoin such
practical observations as have occurred to me on the subject.
    For the accuracy of the facts, the public will of course impli
citly depend upon the Report of the committee.                 For the de
ductions that are here drawn from them, I alone am answer
able.
    The first experiments that were tried, were to ascertain the
friction of three different axle-trees:
    A straight axletree,
    Collinge's patent axletree,
    And an axletree belonging         to Messrs. Bourne, mail-coach
proprietors.
    These experiments were tried with two-wheeled carriages,
 moved by weights and pulleys.         The carriages were placed fir^t
 upon   a  road   of wood,   afterwards    upon one of iron, perfectly
 horizontal : the amount of the weight which put each of them
in motion, was considered as the measure of the friction.
    The weight of the wheels of each carriage was deducted from
 the gross weight, because their weight does not affect the fric
tion of the axletree on which they turn.
    The weight of each carriage, after this deduction was made,
 was 7 cwt. 3 qrs. 23 lbs. that is 890 pounds avoirdupois ; the
weight of the wheels and axletree may be taken at a medium at
250 pounds.
                                                   On the
                                                wooden road.       On iron.
    The carriage on the straight axletree
       was drawn     by                            19 lbs.       '  11 lbs.
    The carriage on the patent axletree,
       drawn by                                   15 lbs.           11 lbs.
    Ditto on Mr. Bourne's axletree, drawn
        by                                        21  lbs.          12 lbs.
    The differences that appeared in       these  experiments upon the
wooden and iron roads, arose from the position of the tire of the
wheels, which caused the tire to sink into, or adhere more or
less to the wooden road; the difference where running on the
iron road was inconsiderable between the compared axletrees.
    The wheels of the two former carriages were common dished
wheels ; the latter with Mr. Bourne's axletree had wheels with
spokes inclined in opposite directions, or, as thev are called,
double-dished wheels*.          To estimate the power necessary to
                                                                   overcome
   * Where wheels are so dished or
                                      splayed, as to throw the sole of tfc;
wheel, ns it sets upon the ground, beyond tlio line let fall perpendicular: -
from the end of the arm of the axletree to the ground, the box of the nave
will pinch the under part of the arm of the axletree near the linch-pin, »M
                                                                           will

overcome the friction          of  these   axletrees,    when compared with
the     power necessary to draw the whole load upon a common
road, the effort of the horses must be stated as being equal to
some      given weight acting with a given velocity.                Each horse
drawing     a  mail-coach     at the rate  of seven   English   miles  per hour,
upon     an  ordinary road, may       be  considered as exerting a power
equal to one hundred pounds.              Sometimes a horse exerts nearly
three times this power, and sometimes, on good roads, much
less ; but, perhaps, one hundred pounds may be taken as an
average
            *.
     We may fairly state, that as eleven pounds were necessary to
overcome the friction of the arms of the axletree, when the car
riage was      loaded with 890 pounds, if the arms of the axletree
were     loaded as in a mail-coach, with something more than four
thousand pounds, it would require fifty pounds to overcome the
friction of the axles ; for the power of four horses drawing a
mail-coach on ordinary level roads, may be estimated at four
hundred pounds, one-eighth of which, viz. fifty pounds, may be
 considered as the resistance occasioned by the friction of the
 axletrees.
                                     Creeping.
      In most carriages the arms of the axletrees are bent a little
 downwards, so that the wheels are four or five inches further
 asunder above than below.            Besides this, in some carriages tine
 arms of the axletrees are bent forwards, so that the wheels are
 nearer together before than behind.
      To determine the effect of this construction, which by work
 men is called the creep of the wheel, the following experiment
  was tried :
      A two-wheeled carriage, with the axletree bent downwards in
 the common manner, was drawn on iron by 14 lbs.; on wood by
 14£.      When the wheels were 4\ inches nearer together at the
 front than behind, it required to draw the same carriage on
 wood 26 lbs. and on iron 20 lbs.             Hence it appears that it is of
 great consequence in the formation of a carriage with bent axle-
 trees, to secure the axletrees in their proper situation, and to
  will pinch the upper part of the arm of the axletree near its shoulder.
 Double-dished wheels are not liable to this defect.       The amount of super
 fluous friction that arises from the circumstance here allmled to, may lie
 calculated by any mechanic, in any given position of the wheel, arising
   from the obliquity of the road, or from its sinking into holes.
      *                                             are held by different authors,
        A variety of opinions upon this subject
  mid by different  practical mechanics. As to      the conclusions which  I mean
  to draw, it is of little consequence w hether   the force of a horse in drawing
 a carriage be estimated higher or lower than what       I have  assumed.
                                         F3                               prevent

prevent them from being forced out of their proper direction by
the effort of the springs, or the giving way of any part of the
work, which fastens the axletrees to the carriage.
   The apparatus with which the following experiments were
tried, is fully described in the annexed Report.   By the liberal
supply of men from the commissariat, I was enabled to carry
                                                               on
the experiments with facility.
   Part of the weight in the following experiments on two-
wheeled carriages was sustained by the guide-pole ; the quantity
of this weight was determined from time to time by a steelyard.
It seldom varied ; but to ascertain the ratio of any inaccuracy
which might arise from this circumstance, when the carriage
was loaded with nine hundred and three quarters, and when
twenty pounds were placed on the guide-pole, it required four
teen pounds to draw it.    When forty pounds were placed upon
      required fourteen pounds and a half to draw it.

carriage with springs 2cwt. lqr. They then kept together.

Then 2 qrs. being added to the carriage with springs, it preceded
the other carriage, the elliptic springs being thus brought more
perfectly into play.
    The gross weights of each carriage, when reduced to pounds,
were nearly as follows: — The carriage with springs                    1008 lbs.
The carriage without springs 623 lbs.             From these experiments
it appears, that in the first place there was but little difference
between elliptic and grasshopper springs, except what arose from
the difference of their weight ; and in the next place it appears,
that the gross difference of weight carried by the carriages, with
and without springs, was nearly as 19 to 6.
    But to show the exact advantage of springs in these experi
ments, the weight of the wheels and axletrecs of both carriages
must be deducted from the gross weight, because the wheels and
axletrees were moved independently of the springs, only the
weight incumbent on the axletree and wheels being liable to the
effect of the springs.      The medium weight of the wheels and
axletrees of each of these carriages was nearly 250 lbs. which
being deducted from the gross weights of each carriage, leaves

 tage over the wooden springs, and that when the force of a man
 was employed to draw a carriage with and without springs, the
 advantage was not only seen but felt.

     Two four-wheeled      carriages,    as nearly similar       as might        be,
  were placed upon the wooden platform.             They were constructed

road.
    The distance between the fore and hinder axletrees in these
carriages was nine feet nine inches.
    These carriages were so made that either of them could be
shortened, so as to bring the hind and fore axletree within six
feet of each other.   They were also so framed as to be stiff and
strong in every direction.   Of these two carriages one had the
springs allowed to play, the other had not.

with springs, carrying the eight hundred weight, preceded the
other.    To show that these carriages were similar to each other,
the springs of the former carriage were now prevented from,
acting, and the carriage was loaded with 6 cwt.
    The springs of the other carriage were then allowed to play,
and the carriage was loaded with 8 cwt. ; when the carriage pre
ceded in the same manner as the first had done.
   The springs of both carriages were then made free, and the
axles of one of them brought within six feet of each other; the
other remaining at nine feet nine inches asunder.       The weight
of both was brought to ail equality, and both were loaded at
lot torn.

   The long carriage rather preceded.
    These experiments were not performed under favourable cir
cumstances, as the position of the hinder axletree in one of the
carriages had been accidentally deranged ; but I beg leave here
to report the result of experiments which had been repeatedly
tried with great care at my own house.
    Both these carriages with the wheels at equal distances, and
the springs prevented from acting: one loaded at top, the other
at bottom.
                                                                  The

               relative   to   Experiments   on    Wheel- carriages.             8S
      The carriage loaded at bottom carried 1579 lbs.
      The carriage loaded at top carried         1505 lbs.
   Both carriages were then tried with the springs in action ; but
no difference appeared.
   From all this 1 conclude, as far as my experience goes, that,
cmter'u paribus,   there is very little difference in draft between
long   and short, and between high and low carriages.
    It may be remarked, that the advantage of springs did not
appear to be so great in those four-wheeled carriages as in the
experiments on two-wheeled carriages, which I have formerly
 mentioned.    This arose from the weight in the four-wheeled
 carriages  not being heavy enough to bend the elliptic springs,
upon which they were supported, with sufficient facility*.
                               Comparison    of Roads.
   Two roads were formed, one of loose gravel, the                       other   of
broken stone.
   The carriages without springs were drawn bv horses                    attached
to the peirameter, one running on the loose gravel, the                  other on
the broken stone ; the former having an additional load                  of   seveu
hundred weight.
   The second carriage running on broken stone, carrying four
hundred weight, besides the weight of the carriage, wheels, &c.
They kept nearly together.
   The same carriages were made to run, one on the brokeu
stone, the other on the well made pavement of the court.
      The carriage on the broken stone carried . .              5 cwt.
      The ditto on the pavement carried                        17 cwt.
   The latter preceded the carriage running on the broken stone.
   The differer.ee between pavement and a road of broken stones,
in this experiment, however enormous it may appear, corre
sponds with others which I have repeatedly tried.                  If,
                                                            however,
the stones are broken sufficiently small, not larger than an incli
and half diameter, they will oppose no very great obstruction to
the motion, either of a horse or of      carriage.

 for the purpose is amply paid for by the increase of bulk that is
 thus obtained.      This I have found to be the case upon the mail-
 coach road between Edgeworthstown and Longford.             Over eight
 miles of this road I have been for some years supervisor, and
.during that time I have had no reason to complain of the size
 to which the workmen break the stones with which it is re
 paired.
      In the Report of the committee, a machine which 1 have con
 trived for giving an accurate section of a road is alluded to.
      It consists of a rail of deal, twenty-one feet long, three inches
 wide, and five inches deep.         On the top of this rail a frame of
 wood, eighteen inches long, slides freely : one of the perpendi
 cular sides of the rail is covered with paper.
      An arm of wood, eighteen inches long, two inches wide, and
 an inch thick, is connected with the side of this sliding frame,
 by means of a common wood screw, upon which this rod turns
 freely at one end, as upon a centre.         Near the other end of the
 rod a piece of fme black lead or pencil moves horizontally, in a
 small pencil case, in which it is urged forward by a slender spiral
 spring.      This long rail is to be laid on any road, the section of
 which is required.        The moveable frame, which slides upon the
 rail as it is moved forward by the hand, permits that end of the
 moveable rod that carries the pencil, to lie upon the ground ;
 where, as the frame advances, it rises over every obstacle, and
 sinks into every hollow in the road, in the same manner as the
 wheel of a carriage rises and sinks ; the black-lead at the same
 time marking the rise and fall of the rod upon the paper, as the
 frame advances.
      Besides this contrivance, a similar machine has been emplo)'ed,
 for the purpose of delineating the path which that part of a
 carriage which is upon springs describes ; and at the same time,
 the path which the axletree which is not upon springs describes.
      A slip of paper several yards long, and five inches broad, was
 attached to one of the vertical sides of the guide-rail, which is
 five inches deep, and is in the middle of the platform.          A per
 pendicular     rod was  fastened   to the axletree of  the carriage, so
 as to rise and fall with the motion of the axletree, as the wheels
 went over any obstacle, or sunk into any hollow. A black-lead
 pencil, pressed by a slender spiral spring, was so placed at the
 bottom of this rod, as to mark its progress, with all its undula
 tions, upon the paper.        A similar rod was attached to the body
 of the carriage, which body was upon springs.             This rod was
 furnished in like manner with a moveable pencil, which de
 scribed the path and undulations of that part of the carriage
 which was on springs ; so that, as the pencils were close to each
                                                                   other,

              relative to Experiments on IVheel-carriages.             91
other, the curves and inequalities of these two paths were accu
rately delineated, and could be examined and compared at lei
sure.
   By means of those contrivances various problems, relative to
the  motion of carriages and the effect of springs, may be resoh cd
at leisure, which could not, by any other means that I am ac
quainted with, he subjected to accurate investigation.
   Upon the whole, I beg leave to observe, that the chief thing
to be attended to      without any comparison, the goodness of
                       is,
the road.
   That the difference in length and height of carriages, within
moderate limits, does not much affect the draft of carriages.
   That carriages may therefore, except where they are obliged
to turn in narrow streets, be of such     alength as to permit the
foremost wheels to lock round, without touching the body of the
carriage.
   That by lowering the centre of gravity of carriages,       by placing
the luggage     at the bottom of the carriage, the draft     is not im
peded, whilst great additional security    is  necessarilv obtained.
   That no very great saving of draft can be expected from the
different forms of axletrees.
   That everv means of saving absolute weight, in the construc
tion of   a carriage, should he adopted.     This caution will be at
tended to bv every person who considers, that in going up          a hill,
the ascent of which      isone foot in twenty, the horses that dravr
the carriage must exert a force equal to one-twentieth           part of
the weight of the carriage and of its load, which, in       a   common
stage-coach,      isoften equal to two hundred weight, and so in
proportion to the acclivity of any hill.
    That the application of springs to carriages, either for carrying
burdens or for pleasure, tends not only to the ease of the tra
veller, to the safety of goods that are carried, to the preservation
of  the roads, and to the duration of carriages themselves, but
that they also materially facilitate their draft.
    That the form of those springs, provided they are properlv
elastic,     of no great consequence.
            is                             By properly elastic,   I mean
 adapted    to the medium   weight  with  which it    proposed
                                                     is           to load
 them for
      :        where  the springs  are strong,  and  the   carriage not
 sufficiently loaded, much of the advantage of springs       is found to
 be wanting.
  It  is  therefore much to be wished, that some means may be ob
 tained of proportioning the pliability of the springs to the different
 weights with which they maybe loaded at different times. Who
 ever has travelled alone in      a  mail-coach has felt what      I   al
 lude to.
                                                                       And

  92         Report  of the Committee    of the Dublin Society
     And lastly, that wooden springs may be advantageously ap
  plied to common carts.
      I have employed them in four one-horse carts, that have been
  in daily use, for nearly fcur years.    These carts are usually loaded
 with    fourteen  hundred   weight,   and  are much employed in car
  rying stones for the repair   of roads.
     I have tried straight and elliptic springs, and have employed
 both sorts successfully.
     A piece of common tough ash, five inches and a half deep in
  the middle, two inches deep at each end, and three inches broad,
 'mounted, on fixed shackles at one end, and with linking plates at
  the other, is cheap and durable.
     The iron work of the shackles may last for many years.         The
  wooden springs may be renewed at any time for about ten shil
  lings ; and I am well satisfied that these springs will soon be in
  common use among common carriers.

                            Your obliged and obedient servant,

 XXIII.      Report of the Committee of Natural Philosophy , ap
     pointed by the Dublin Society, on the Experiments upon
     lYheel-carriages, made by Mr. Edgevvorth, on the 28lk
     of May 1816, and succeeding Days, at the Dublin Society's
     House, Kildare-street.
 Dr. Litton        having kindly undertaken, at the request of this
 committee, to take notes for them of the Experiments on Wheel-
 carriages,,
     Your committee proceeded to form a Report thereon ; but Mr.
Edgeworth having favoured them with some observations on
these experiments, your committee were of opinion that such
comments, with a statement of the experiments, in conformity
with the notes of Dr. Litton, would answer the object of the
Society better then a mere Report by the committee ; they there
fore beg leave to lay the statement and the comments before the
Society.
     The apparatus employed in       these experiments was as follows :
A pulley     seven feet in diameter, mounted upon a carriage which
can be drawn forward by men or horses.            It turns upon a small
centre, and has been executed with such precision as to have
nearly the accuracy of a balance.           Mr. Edgeworth has given
the name of peirameter to this machine.               To determine the
friction arising from the motion of its axis, and the bending of
                                                                     the

this pulley, their equipoise was overcome         placing half pound   by                       a
on either one side or the other.
    To compare the draft of two carriages         means of this wheel, by

                 a            round      must  be  fastened to one car

most, until both proceed together, the weight thus added be

as to be level in every direction      all the carriages used in these

between the planks.       The pole of each carriage was provided
 with brass rollers, which ran on each side of the guide-rail to
 prevent the friction, and uncertainty of fiauuehes, and guide the
 carriage when drawn forward.
    To overcome the vis inertice of the carriages before they were
 brought into competition,       detent was applied to the peirame

of draught, when drawn forward by the peirameter, and greate
being substituted for anti-attrition composition on the straight
axletree, the patent, though loaded with two quarters of a hun

   On the Effect    of bending   the Arm of the Axle downwards,
             so us  to  produce  what    is termed a Creep.
   A two-wheeled carriage with the axle bent downwards, was
drawn on iron by 14 lbs. ; on wood by 14 lbs. or 14ilbs.
The axle of this carriage was so altered as that the horizontal
gather in front was four inches and a half, and the points of the
circumference, of the wheels in front, nearest to each other,
were six inches above the road.            The carriage was then just
drawn on wood by 26 lbs. ; on iron by 20 lbs.
       On the Effects    of Springs  on   Two-wheeled Carriages.
    Two carriages of equal weight and similar construction, were
tried by the peirameter, one having gr'asshopper springs, the
other without springs ; that with springs carrying 8 cwt. 2 qrs.
preceded the one without springs, carrying 4 cwt. 2 qrs. 7 lbs.
    The same carriages were again compared, substituting elliptic
for grasshopper springs ; 2 qrs. 7 lbs. being added to the carriage
without springs ; when the springs were prevented from acting,
the carriages kept together ; the springs being permitted to act,
 there were added to the carriage with springs, 2 cwt. lqr. — they
 then kept together ; on 2 qrs. being added to the carnage with
 springs, it preceded \ the springs being by this brought mom
 perfectly into play.

                  on Experiments upon Wheel-carriages.               95
 were of equal draft, moving at a quick rate.          At a slower rate
judged     to  be  about  2\ miles  an  hour; the wooden springs car
 ried   3cwt.   2 qrs, — being  lqr. less.
         The Efficacy    of Springs in aiding Animal Exertion.
     A man drew, with his utmost exertion, a two-wheeled car
 riage with wooden springs blocked,        which was loaded with 2 cwt.
 a given     space   in nine seconds ; — 1 cwt. 2 qrs. were added and
 the springs permitted to play; — with a similar exertion, he drew
 it over the same space in 8| seconds.
     N. B. It is to be observed, that in all these experiments the
 load on the guide-rail was made as nearly the same as could be
 judged by lifting ; but in order to ascertain how far a difference,
 in this respect might affect the results, the following experiment
  was made. — In a carriage having the entire load 9cwt. 2 qrs.
  7 lbs. the weight on the guide- rail was 40 lbs. ; the carriage was
 just put in motion by a weight passing over a pulley of 14{ lbs.
  when the load on the guide-rail was only 20 lbs. the carriage
 was put in motion by 14 lbs.
                       On Eour-wheeled Carriages.
     Two four-wheeled carriages, as nearly similar as possible, were
  placed on the wooden platform.          They were constructed in such
  a manner that the load on either of them might be placed within
  eighteen inches of the ground, or raised to the height of three
  feet and a half, or even eight feet above the road.     The distance
  between the fore and hind axletrees in these carriages, was nine
  feet nine inches, and they were so made, that each of them could
  he shortened so as to bring the fore and hind axletrees within
  »ix Feet of each other.      Of these two carriages, one hail the
  springs allowed to play, the other not.         The first was loaded
  with 8 cwt. the other with G cwt.          Both were connected with
  the peirameter, and the carriage with springs carrying the 8 cwt.
  preceded the other.
      The springs of the former carriage were prevented from act
   ing, and the carriage loaded with 6 cwt. ; the springs of the
   other carriage were made free, and it was loaded with 8 cwt. ;
   when this carriage preceded.       This experiment proved that the
  draft of these carriages was the same.
      The springs of both carriages were then made free, and the
   axles of one of them brought within six feet of each other ;
   those of the other carriage remaining       at nine feet nine inches
   asunder.     The weight of both was brought to an equality, and
   both were loaded at bottom.
                                                                    The

   Two roads were formed, one of gravel, the other of broken
stones ; two    carriages without springs were connected with the
peirameter,     one  running on gravel, the other on stones ; the
former having a load of 7 cwt. the other of 4 cwt. ; they kept
nearly together.
    The same carriages were made to run, one on the broken
stones, the other on coarse pavement :

                many important Truths in Phytology.                             97
  (often while learning) were too apt to disorder the clearness and
  conciseness of the picture.           So frequently has the whole now
  been renewed; so continually have I gone over the same yearly
  arrangement, that I can with more perfect perspicuity, and I
  hope certainty, show the manner in which plants are formed;
  the mechanism they possess ; the impossibility of their being at
  till sensitive ; show the power which food has on plants, the
  variety of alterations it will produce in their appearance, and
  how truly each change is adapted to the situation, soil, and
  aspect for which it was made.
      But before I commence this account, I owe to myself and to
  the public, to show the manner in which my whole studies have
  been regulated — that they may be proper judges of the credit
  due to me, whether I deserve the confidence I have ventured to
  claim, since my offering    is,
                                I    understand, thought to be system
                                                                   a            ;
 instead of that which   it   really is, an exact and unaltered daily copy
  of what Nature truly presents each year in the interior of plant,    a
  and which any person possessing              a common microscope may
  see, provided they will follow the picture as        I      have done, by
  a daily review of the increase of the interior of each vegetable,
 from the first of its commencement to its decay. — In explaining
  the manner in which    I     have followed the study for the last six
  teen years, I     may without exaggeration say, that         1  believe no
 one has ever dissected or watched plants with the unwearied
 diligence and patience that have taking up a fresh plant of the
                               I           ;
 same kind every three days for nearly four years following, watch
 ing the interior picture, and pursuing each ingredient from its
 first formation to its perfection, and hence to it*; destruction.
  Convinced that    a   plant was only to be well known        by   this pro
 gressive picture,  I  (besides  all  other dissections)  submitted   to this;
 and have gained more knowledge, and profited more,                        by
                                                                          this
 method, than by any other previously tried.               I  have been re
 peatedly told that my dissections are admirable, but that my.
 system  is  not admissible.    1    have no system.   I   think may ven
                                                               I
 ture to say, that any one who should see the natural specimens
I   could show, would be convinced in              amoment, because they
explain   themselves.       How is  it  possible that the specimens can be
true,   and   yet the facts  they  elucidate,   and  bring to light, false      ?
I   have with the greatest care avoided forming any system, but
that which the dissections themselves plainly establish.                   To
prove this,   I    shall bring as an example        " the seeds formed in
the roots," and mention the different specimens, and give the
drawings as they naturally appear in the tree, and as                  I took
them,    and   ask my reader whether any         other  explanation   can  be
given of such series of plain facts
                a                     In September 1810, laying

98     On  the Anatomy of Vegetables; intended      to substantiate
of powder forming in the extremities of the side-roots. (Plate I.
fig. 1 .) Continuing to open a fresh tree as the season advanced,
and following up the ingredient in tin- interior, I saw that
powder soon coagulate and form into balls, which, increasing hy
degrees, moved in a few weeks through the root in every direc
tion, till they all centred in the different vessels of the alburnum
(fig. 2), and then mounted in a slow movement, tied together hy
a slight thread of the line of life.     Continuing my examination,
I suddenly discovered that the balls had left the alburnum cylin
der, and were collected around different buds at the extremity of
the last year's shoot (fig..')).    In my next specimens I saw that
the balls were entirelv left to themselves, while all the buds were
in the very act of running up into the new shoot.           In the fol
lowing specimen thev were regularly fixed there, the shoot
being just formed by the fresh flow of the sap, and completed
bv this process. The next appearance showed the halls collect
ing at the bottom of the new shoot, aggregated into the figure
of a mulberry (fig. 4).      I now redoubled lny attention, impatient
to   see what would follow; when I found that a vessel had been
formed (while the balls were collecting), and had dipped into each
separate bud (0,0,0).       The next process was the running in of
the balls into this vessel (see MM), when so many were regularly
dropped into each pericarp, drawn in bv degrees by means of
the line of life which tied all the balls together (fig. .5). As soon
as the balls entered the seed-vessel, a part surrounded them and
seemed to fix them in their appropriate places, and the seed-
vessel closed ; but on cutting it open several times within the
next fortnight, no further change had taken place ; but a very
great alteration in the flower, which had gained its calyx and pe
duncles. In less than a fortnight more the flower was sufficiently
advanced to commence the fructification of the seeds ; and the
line of life passing through each ball, a figure began to be per
ceived in the interior (see Lime-iced) , which was undoubtedly the
embryo of the plant. And the following specimen showed most
plainly, that those very balls, formed at the extremities of the
side-roots, running through the middle root to the alburnum,
and fixed in the seed-vessel, were really the heart of the seed,
since the progressive picture finished by the growth of the em
bryo in the ball.
    Is this a system  ? or, Is it not rather the exact copying of the.
interior progress of a plant, in which neither the imagination nor
even the reason of the dissector has aught to do?       I have blindly,
I think, followed my copy ; my specimens exactly show the dif
ferent pictures I have explained.        How then can they be just,
and the explanation false, since they are regularly traced to ths
fructification of the seed? And how can they be nourishment,
                                                                  since

             many important Truths in Phytology.                       99
since we follow    till the embryo grows within, and till the        seed
puts on all its outward cover?   Between the commencement of
this picture and the completion,   above twelve specimens are
drawn and exhibited, showing them in each different state.          How
ean any one forge all these, and make them exactly agree            with
the   plant? And if they      are acknowledged        to be true, how can
such plain facts be otherwise explained?          I
                                               have given this exam
ple, merely to show the maimer in       which I study: it is as nearly
that adopted in chemistry as possible        ;   since in botany you fol
low with your eye the object from state to state while growing,
and must therefore perfectly understand the manner of its com
position ; while  in chemistrv the matter is decomposed and re-
composed again.     Both means can admit of true facts only, and
each that I wish to establish will be given with equal clearness
and precision.    The following propositions 1 shall first clearly
explain, as they are absolutely necessary to the obtaining a
thorough knowledge of the forms and nature of vegetable life ;
and mav be called fundamental maxims, which ought first to be
proved true, to open the way for more practical laws. These will
show what a plant is ; and indeed, in describing and drawing up
the comparative anatomy of an animal and plant, in this Maga
zine for AugustlSlo, I exactlv fixed those marks of division which
this and the next letters will more clearly illustrate.
   The chief truths I have hitherto endeavoured to make known
are these ; the proofs of which I shall enforce with as much ex
pedition as possible.
 .1. That there is no perspiration       in plants.
  2. That there is no circulation    of sap.
    3. That the spiral wire is the muscle of the plant,
    4. That the leaves are the lungs of the plant.
    5. That the different divisions of the leaves are formed of the
 elongations of the bark and inner bark vessels.
    6. That the hairs and instruments of that kind are the means
 which Nature takes to form the different juices according to their

    When I have shown the absolute truth of all these proposi
 tions in a way, I hope, that cannot well be contradicted, 1 have
 many more with which constant dissection has acquainted me,
 which will altogether (I flatter myself) exhibit a regular
 system formed by Nature, and established in truth ; which may
 at last force conviction even on those learned botanists, who
 have such a holy horror of committing themselves, that they dare
 not trust their superior minds to hold the scale between truth
 and falsehood, and try the argument by a fair examination, and
 by the complete consistency of the opinions.
    My first proposition is," That there isno perspiration in plants."
 I have already said much on this subject. I shall now therefore
 only recapitulate the simple facts, and the manner in which I
 prove that there is none. I shall first show the difference be-
 tweeen perspiration and evaporation, since to comprehend terms
 clearly, elucidates a subject beyond any other means. Perspira
 tion is a matter thrown off in its liquid state, from apertures
 contrived for the purpose, being a matter injurious to health,
 and therefore necessary to be repelled : it is often seen in drops
 of water on the skin. But evaporation is merely a sign that water
 exists there.    It flies off in vapour unseen; and whether it is or is
 not condensed again, depends on the presence or absence of one
.of its constituents, hydrogen, which, the moment it appears, has
 such an affinity for oxygen that they directly join and recompose
 water. Now the chief proof which Hales gives of the perspiration
 of plants     is,
                that    you place vegetable
                          if         a             in bell-glass, drops of

 water will soon run down the interior surface.         Thisis   true   but
                                                                        ;
is  easily explained. Oxygen flows         quantities from every healthy
                                              in
 plant:   it   taken from the decomposed water in the vegetable,
               is
 and the hydrogen          secreted.

                                     from the plant, though             (if
                                                                        any

     The philosophers of the last century, not being in the habit of
examining plants with the microscope, thought all those figures
discovered on the cuticle of the leaves were uncovered bubbles
of    water, because they appeared clear and pellucid.              But all
these figures are either cuticles formed              by
                                                   balls standing on high
pedestals, or figures of still more curious make, resembling retorts,
                           a
cucurbits, and cylinders of various sorts and sizes, divided             by
                                                                         re
gular valves, and formed to produce vacuums, to separate water
into its component parts       ;in short, established for every purpose
of   chemical affinity ;   bywhich means the juices are received from
 the atmosphere, and changed to the many compounds necessary
to   compose the various juices of the plant.         That balls standing
 on stalks or long retorts cannot be perspiration, every one will
 readily own — but to make the matter plainer still, take two
              :
 plants of the same sort, expose one to the open atmosphere                    ;
shade the other above.        The first will be probably covered with
dew; the other will remain perfectly dry, not the smallest drop
 appearing on the leaves.      Where then        the perspiration
                                                     is             ? Place
 this plant in a room, and      itwill receive dust like any other fur
niture;    nor will that dust agglutinate or thicken           on the con

 off, leaving the leaves perfectly clear    — :    positive proof that no
                                                      a
 water can ooze from the leaves, or they would exactly resemble
the plant when disordered with the honey-dew, and be as nasty
in    appearance   as they then are.       And how deformed Nature
would be  !   for one of its greatest beauties        the vivid green and
                                                           is
cleanliness of its shrubs and trees.      Would      not  the dust stick on
every part, and spoil all its beauty          or roll off in large balls,
                                              is ;
smearing the leaf as      itpassed   ?   It  astonishing that this ob
jection should not occur as so very obvious.
    The next proof shall give of the impossibility of perspiration
                      I
is,  that every vegetable possesses an impervious skin, through
 which not    a drop of water can pass. To understand and.be cer
tain whether plants do or do not possess            skin capable pf shut

ting out all outward moisture, independent of the figures or hairs
 already mentioned,     I   procured with great labour near thirty
 different specimens of this impervious cuticle, in which however
I  must observe that the pores were most conspicuous.            The skins
were taken from the outward cuticles of leaves, stems, and petals
of various plants.      Placing them on         glass, with the interior
                                                a
side upwards,     I rubbed with the greatest care, with my finger
covered with very fine cambric, and soon found that my con-

 cuticle ; since after friction it left behind neither pore nor pat

 all alike, though some were thicker than others :— some indeed

more reasons can be wanting to prove the mistake which philo-
isophers have made         this respect.
                             in               But there are two or three
 more as convincing.
    The sand plants, the rock plants, take almost all their nutri
ment from the atmosphere, their roots being incapable of be
stowing any, or at most            very trifling quantity.
                                        a                       But      they        if
 are to lose again in perspiration the greatest part of what they
receive, how are they to be nourished                   the want of the
                                                           ?    It   is
impervious skin in the rock plants, which leaves thetn open to
imbibe all the nutriment they require, being almost without
 hairs, but receiving the dew, &e. direct as              falls. But the it
sand plants, having a quantity             hairs and instruments, have
                                                  of
the impervious cuticle, absorbing through these hairs an exces
sive quantity of nourishment, which thus enters the plant.                                 It
 was these plants that were said to perspire so much, and                 was        it
this liquid collected from the broken instruments that they called
perspiration; whereas            all to be seen entering the plant from
                               it
                               is
every hair, and thus meandering in vessels made for the pur
pose.
.
    Of what         use could perspiration         be to plants that have little           or
                                                                                           no

no heat, no exercise, that deserves     the name   ? What is the    use
of perspiration to animal life    ?  To free the hlood from its     re
dundant water ; to expel from the body those particles which
irom repeated circulation have become acrimonious.           But there
being no circulation, there is no matter to become hurtful; and
as fresh matter is hourly sent into the plant in every way, it can
not want cooling; since the highest heat the plant knows is
(luring fructification, which never exceeds 13° above atmospheric
heat at that time, and can therefore be in no danger from so
trifling an increase of temperature.      What then is that matter
 which philosophers collected, and called perspiration?         It is a
 matter which, instead of proceeding from the plant, is wholly
 drawn in from the atmosphere, and taken from the broken hairs;
 and which may be regularly traced descending from the points
 of the hairs, and thus from valve to valve, till it enters the plant.
 Had simple nutriment alone been necessary, a naked pore would
 have been sufficient.     But to form the juices according to che
 mical affinity, and specific gravity, wanted more instruments, far
 more preparation; and this is the reason of the very curious in
 struments constantly seen on the leaves, and the strange figures
 presented to our view: few of the hairs that are not double ; few
 that have not many valves, to alter the juices by degrees as they
 meet.
    I could add many other reasons against this established idea
 of "the perspiration of plants," did I not fear to tire my reader,
 and did I riot also consider that I have given amply sufficient to
 convince all those who are not resolved not to be convinced.         I
 am sorry to say, In botany there appears such a holy horror
 of changing established maxims, that scarcely mathematical evi
 dence against them will suffice. This must at once put an end to
 every improvement in the science.     And yet no one can be more
 against admit tins fads without strkt evidence than I am. But
 examination should always be bestowed.
    I now turn to my second maxim, " That there is no circula
 tion in plants."    When reading again (and with still stricter at
 tention)  the excellent  work of Sir J. E. Smith on Botany, (the
 best compendium      I know of what Phytology is at this time)
 I, to my great surprise, discovered that Mr. Knight considered
 both bark juice and sap as the same liquid, and forming but
 one sort. This at once accounts for the strange mistake between
 us, concerning the sap, and its return through the bark.      I shall
 not stop long to consider how he can esteem as the same, two
 liquids so diametrically opposite in every respect, and which when
 analysed are so essentially different: the one formed of a sort of
 gluten and albumen extracted from the earth, and probably
 proceeding in part from the underground vegetables, of which
                                  G 4                              the

the earth is full ; the other drawing its foundation from the at
mosphere, and composed of the narcotic principles, tannin, oils,
extractive matter, gvfms and resins, &c. &c. Thus they are as
various in their effects as unlike in their appearance ; the one
tanning leather, the other having no effect of this kind.                But
this confusion has arisen from the firs, where the turpentine is
apt to spread not a little into the wood, and thus mix with the
 sap, which, in this case, loses a little. But its overrunning its pro
 per bounds is no reason for reckoning the two juices the same :
 the one is compounded in the leaves of the tree, the foundation
 taken from the atmosphere ; the other proceeding from the
juices of the earth, and to be considered as the liquid of the
 ground rather than the juices of the plant.
    I shall first show how the bark juice is formed. It is composed
 in the pabulum of the leaves, to which the juices (taken by means
 of the hairs from the atmosphere) constantly contribute ; and
 when the pabulum is completed, the rest of the juices flow in
 large vessels from the leaf-stem to the bark.          Now this is what
 Mr. Knight calls " the return of the sap." But there is not a
 drop of sap in   it,and his mistake arises from taking the muscles
 for sap-vessels. However, when once this        is  proved mistake, all
                                                            a
 the fabric must fall with it.     That the muscles which run from
 the wood to the leaves, and which are commonly called the spiral
 wire, are incapable of carrying sap,    is  easily shown   : two of them
 are perfectly without aperture and the middle one, though hol
                                  ;
 low, contains nothing but oil to humect and lubricate the spiral,
 that it may not contract, and thus let out (by continual agi
 tation) the most important part        of the plant.

 and wood,  it   detaches one from the other, and by separating al
 lows time for the sap to coagulate and form a new row of w ood            ;
 while the sap also pushing back the bark prepares              a fresh row
 of alburnum, allowing the wood-vessels to lengthen, and             by thus
 increasing    runs through   the new    wood.    A   large  collection   of
 sap  isalways to be discovered at the bottom of the root at this
 time, serving as reservoir for the alburnum which plainly shows

 than the flow of the sap in the woodt" since that has no reservoir
 below.
    The next manner of the flow of the sap       is up the wood-vessels.
This   is
       a    constant rill, which   is however much quickened in the
morning or evening; but continues more or less throughout the
 year.

be divided into such diminutive  pieces, it is impossible that they
should form sap-vessels.   They are not sap vessels, but sap va
cancies; which convey the liquid up the tree with more freedom
than vessels could, as the escape of the buds horizontally would
be apt       by moving the vessels to twist them, and thus impede the
sap; whereas the vacancies formed in the wood, move to and
fro with      it,

    Ishall now show Mr. Knight's opinions (as far as            can un              I
derstand them), and contrast them with my own.             We certainly
both agree as to the existing vessels, though differing in the pur
pose for which they are intended.               astonishing that, not

vessels; this    think wonderful: but

daily, from their first existence, that their purpose can he really
proved.       '     '
     Mr. Knight believes that the sap flows up the spiral vessels in
thewood; that they are the sap-vessels, which convey all this liquid
up the tree and that, arrived at the branches, they run up to the
                  ;
bottomof the leaves, and convey the returning sap to the bark
                                             " that the spirals
downwards.    (on the contrary) am convinced
                      I
are the      muscles        the tree, can convey no sap, that they mean
                           of
der     in every part of the leaf to accelerate, its motion; and that
the     large vessels meeting the spirals, at the bottom of the leaf,
are     the inner bark-vessels running downwards, filling the bark
anew       which was lost        by     the late winter, and which                 is   all formed
in   the leaves.
     My first reason against Mr. Knight's opinion         taken from          is
 the size     the spirals. That so small a vessel should be chosen
              of
  for the purpose of nourishing        great tree, when sixty spirals
                                                 a
  would scarcely make       small thread, seems preposterous.      The
  next reason against            is a
                             its extreme twisting and eiernal agita

10b'   On the Anatomy       of Vegetables;           intended to substantiate
the wood. How comes it then that the whole wood is stained with
the liquor, and in the root (where the spirals are slopped) double
the quantity of coloured wood is discovered ? If the spirals alone
received the sap, the wood should be coloured only where they
run; it would stop entirely in the root, and only half the wood
would be coloured.
    I have shown that the sap runs in wood vacancies instead of
sap-vessels, and how this reconciles the admirable observation
of Sir J. E. Smith concerning the splitting of the wood.                Now
again,  if  the  spirals carry  the sap  to  the  leaves, why put    in   re
quisition the largest vessels in the tree       to  carry the  sap on   from
tlie leaves downwards to the bark ? why such an increase of
vessels to convey the same quantity of liquid? — Surely there is a
 contradiction here (see fig. 9). But the whole return of the sap
may be refuted by the simple truth, that a half pint cannot ctm-
 tain.a gallon.      Mr. Knight supposes that all the quantity of sap,
which in mounting occupies ten times the size of the bark, in
descending again runs into the bark-vessels filled already with
their own liquid, yet does not increase their size. Thus a. ..a is the
 bark, and b           b the wood, bb is added to aa, and yet remains
 the same size ; nor in any degree en!arges,or doubles its number nf
vessels. Let itdescend ineversuch small quantities, it must all still
pass through the stem of the tree, which is infinitely too narrow
in its bark and too small to admit             it;
                                               besides that     has but its
                                                                       it
inner bark vessels descending; all the others pass round the tree;
nor could   I    ever discover a vessel in the bark containing sap                     :
and there    is    certainly no. confusing together two liquids difr
fering  so   much   as the bark juice and sap.
    That famous trial which       isalways mentioned so triumphantly
as proving the descent of the sap, much better shows the descent
of the bavk juice.     I    mean cutting a gash in the tree, and its
increasing  in    the upper and not the lower orifice of the wound.
Now the whole lump formed

may still be given that there      isno circulation of sap,        showing  by
that the vessels which Mr. Knight has chosen for the purpose are
muscles, and can therefore contain no sap              and that the large

From the       birth of plants to their end, from the first of their for
mation to the last,  the spirals perform but one part, that of
proving the strength of the tree, and its cause of motion. — I now
therefore turn to my third proposition.
     III.      Thai   (he    Spiral        If ire   is the Muscle      of the Plant.
  To prove that the spiral wire         is the muscle of a plant, and
acts on    and for the plant exactly as the independent muscle doei
 for the animal body, — I shall first draw up the physical resem
 blance, showing in how true and perfect a manner every part
 suits.    In the first place, muscles are to the animal body, the
 strength of motion.        Like the wood of the vegetable, the bone
 may lay claim to support the figure;        but the muscle is the only
 source of real strength in both.       Wherever strength and motion
 are required, there is the muscle found ; and wherever strengthand
 motion are requisite in the plant, there the spiral wire is dis
  covered,        it is involuntary motion only that can be compared
 to the vegetable, it is that only which I refer to in animals.          I
 showed in myComparison of animal and vegetable Life*, that the
'latter had neither brain nor nerves, and could not therefore have
  any voluntary motion ; but that, to make it amends for this ap
  parent privation, it possessed in a very superior degree that in
  voluntary motion to be discovered in animals ; that motion
  which is called the vis insita of the muscles, belongs to no other
 part; which, when the muscle of an animal is completely di
  vided from every other ingredient, will convulse it and keep it in
  a continual agitation     for a time, especially if the light shines
  onit.   This has been called the vis insita of the muscles. The
  cause of this vis insita in auimal muscles           unknown  is  but in      ;
  the spiral wire     it  certainly light, and moisture, that act on
                           is                                                          it ;
  since the moment           exposed to the light (especially after being
                            it   is
  detained some time in the dark), its motion           excessive, though
                                                                 is
  perfectly inert before.      Nay, have      I         in
                                                mv sliders placed an ani
  mal muscle in one, and         spiral wire in the other, and they have

   both on being presented to the light moved much                 but the      ;
  spiral infinitely more than the animal muscle — still both light    :
   and moisture seemed to affect each, though in an unequal degree.
   Thus the cause of motion, the means of strength, to both muscle
   and spiral wire, both possessing the same              insita, who can
                                                                 v    is

Weak and fragile     thing called the corolla of a flower : how beau
tiful is each petal formed ! but so frail, it would seem capable of
being destroyed by breathing on it: — and yet it will fold and re
fold into different forms, when passing from a bud to a full
blown flower; will bear exposure to an evaporating atmosphere,
without being hurt ; will support the change of weather, rain,
 and even a storm ; and such is its strength, that take the lovely
 eonvolvulus tribe, and press the petals with your finger, and you
 will find a resistance beyond all conception of its force : run a
 thread through it to prevent its folding; and if your thread is ever
 so strong, it will either break          it,
                                       or tear the corolla to pieces                     ;

                                  is
still more in the leaf, as the whole health of the plant depends

them the name of lungs to the plant, though they have few or

the spiral wire keeps them, aided by the wind, produces an eter
nal change in the air around each tree. But for this, the oxygen
they give out would remain (owing to its weight)                  under the
plant: but the muscles agitating its multiplied little fans, mix
all the different gases together, and keep them when the wind
fails in eternal agitation.       All the mechanism of the leaf is ma
naged      not  only by   the  same   stripes as the petals, but by the
mechanical contrivance of the leaf-stalk.             It is the gatherer on
each end of the peduncle that is the chief source of motion in
 the leaves.      It is but watching this for a few hours, to see all its
 different motions, and to be convinced it is to the spiral it owes
 them, and all its strength also.         The stem of the plant possesses
 not one-tenth part of the motion of the peduncle, nor has it a
quarter of its spiral wire, its portion of muscles being exactly
 equivalent to the action it is obliged to exert.            In those leaves
 that must necessarily turn, follow the motions of the sun, open
 and close in the morning and "evening, there are always more
 muscles than in the plants that do not open and close.                Those
 plants    that  do  not  move  their  leaves  have  no spiral wire, such  as
  the^w, lichens,       sea  weeds,  &c.   ; but the  confervas,  that  move
 like a worm and twist in every direction, are, like the tendrils,
 composed almost wholly of muscles. Take the spirals out of the
  peduncle; nay, take only a few of them, and the leaf turns no
  more: take them out of the tendril, and it becomes perfectly in
  ert: — but the spiral you have taken from thence, moves on the
  glass for hours.
       Can more and stronger proofs be given? Those leaves which
  have most motions have most spiral wire, and have it most twisted ;
  and if the spiral is taken from the plant, it is perfectly inert,
  while the part taken from it moves eternally. These proofs, add
  ed to the vis insita of the spiral, must, I think, be allowed to be
  as positive evidence as we generally are able to procure of that
  vvhjch is allowed to be true ; and therefore sufficient to enable
  me with confidence to say that the spiral wire is proved to be
   the muscle of the plant; and that therefore Mr. Knight's idea of
   the return of the sap must be a mistake, since the vessels he
   fixed on for the purpose are incapable of carrying any liquid ex
   cept a little oil — being the muscles of the plant — and that there
   fore there is no circulation of the sap ; but that the larger vessels
    are bark -vessels, which can convey no sap, but are full of bark-
   juice: — that on a thorough examination of the bark, there are but
    the inner bark-vessels which run down the tree, all the rest,
    moving round it.       I hope, therefore, I shall be thought to have
    proved the three propositions I undertook to show.
       In my next I shall show the three following, with the same
    degree of truth.     I should apologize for the style; but it is dif

     In giving the few specimens, though for want of room I shall
 not be able to give the twelve ; yet 1 hope I may draw a series
 sufficient to thoroughly explain the formation of the seed in its
 regular process.       1st. The view of the radicles and the passage
 of the powder into ball : the part from a to b being generally
 lost in the earth when the root is taken up, if great care is not
 had to prevent the accident, but they are always to be found
 in the ground.          Fig. 1, natural size, is made rather too
 large. Fig. 2 is the vessels running through the root, and all
 centring in the alburnum vessels, and proceeding up to the dif
 ferent buds, but not entering them.        The buds are then seen to
 forsake them, and to pass up into the new shoot just formed, bv
 stalks growing under each bud, as in fig. 7, and thus running up
 to their proper places in the new shoot. This is the reason why
 the new wood is always grooved, even when that shape is lost
 in more advanced age — the stalks growing within the groove.
 Fig. 4 is the new shoot round which the buds have arranged them
 selves, and a vessel formed to convey the balls from bud to bud,
 dropping so many at each pericarp ; which then closes on them,
 while the collection from which they run at LL decreases
 hourly till it is all exhausted.    In the arum, when the seeds are
 about to    enter the  seed-vessel, if a specimen is taken horizon
 tally, the seeds may be seen for the next hour to move into the
different pericarps up the stem of the flower at fig. 4, drawu
in by the line of life at d d. Then follows the last scene, the
seeing those very balls fructified, which had moved from the root
upwards, and the embryo growing in the ball. The ball is cer
tainly only the heart of the seed, and reaches from x to w, at
fig. 6.     I know not how these specimens can be otherwise ex
plained. The fructification proves it the seed ; besides that I
continue to follow it up till the seed puts on its cover and drops
into the earth. And there is no reason brought against these
numerous facts, except that it was never discovered before, and
that the flower-bud is made (Mr. Knight supposes) ia the bark.
That the leaf-bud is formed there I have always shown j but that
                                                                  the

the flower-bud is formed in the      interior is so true, that no peeler
or barker but would laugh at us for thinking it doubtful: be
sides that it has so many different changes, all of which I have
exactly traced, that it is impossible 1 should be deceived : fol-*
lowing the interior of a plant every three days, and taking up a
fresh one for the purpose, I know not how 1 can miss the truth
in so close an investigation, and that for near four years fol
lowing.
     Fig. 8 discloses the different manner in which the sap-vessels
appear when the specimens are cut          horizontally, or perpendicu
larly.     The   hollow  of  the  vacancies   in which the sap runs at
bbb, fig. S, and the manner the spiral is carried round at ddd,
 are most plain, and account for the warping of the wood and its
 motion back again.
     Fig. 9 is a specimen of the sumach, showing the bark-vessels
 at k k, and the spirals or muscles at 55 : the one to move the
leaf, the first to convey the juice made there to the bark.          Surelv,
when it is recollected what excessive           investigation all plants
 have undergone for the last sixteen years, my discovering so
 much will not be considered as a proof of their falsehood : for,
 in truth, plants had never before been dissected; for what is
 cutting a plant two or three times in a year, when compared with
 following its interior formation day by day ? And if you are to
 know how a watch is made, how can it be known, but by ex
 amining and studying all its parts and taking to pieces all its
  wheels ? And here is a more difficult formation ; for it is not only
 a piece of mechanism, but one that alters its appearance though
 by slow degrees.      Yet I again say- no one will or can know or
 understand a process, but by daily following each ingredient, and
 not allowing a single week to intervene without the examination
 of the interior increase of the vegetable he is studying.

  XXX. On the Cosmogony of Moses ; in Answer                 to F. E        s.

                   unwearied    adversary F. E          s professes in his
  last letter to have a presentiment that it will call forth a reply,
  and, like one of the old augurs to whom he bears more than one
   point of resemblance, has taken care to ensure that his pre
   diction may come to pass.      In fact, he has brought a charge
   against me of having    violated  the jus belli, the law which cus
   tom has imposed on such combatants as him and me.                  He ac
   cuses me not only of taunting him, which           was very ill-natured

   and perverse on my part, but of putting words in his mouth
   which   he never uttered.      I must endeavour to get out of this
   scrape as well as I can, though I fear it will be at the risk, which
   I am loth to incur, of ruffling still further the serenity of my
   adversary's temper.
      He challenges me to produce a passage from any of his let
   ters, in which he has affirmed, either directly or by inference,
   that corals are locomotive animals.            As I have no chance of
   finding a thing so ridiculous asserted tolidem verbis, I shall con
   tent mvself with collecting it by inference, or rather from syno
   nymous expressions.        But first 1 beg to remark, that I never
   supposed   F.  E      s to  be so beside himself as seriously to main
  tain such an absurdity ; and I should not have condescended to
   notice a verbal error, however extraordinary, if he had not first
   introduced that captious method of carrying on the controversy
' between us.
      In a paper which was published in May (Philosophical Maga
   zine, xlvii. p. 348), F. E-           s has asserted      that zoophytes
   are moving creatures that have life*.         These words, in the .rela-      '
   tion in which they occur, must convey to the mind of every
   reader precisely the same idea as locomotive animals.                 I have
   never heard that any motions have been proved to belong to
   zoophytes different from the motions of mere irritability, which
   are common to this class of beings and to plants, and which
   therefore cannot be thought to be alluded to as characterizing
   any department of animated nature.             The phrase in the text,
   " moving creatures that have life," being clearly intended to
  distinguish animals, it would be mere quibbling, to assigu it a
  sense which is equally applicable to animals and vegetables.                 I
  cannot then be censured for not suspecting F. E                   s of such a
  trick or play upon words, as imputing to this expression a mean
  ing that will apply to sensitive plants, and more or less to every
  vegetable tribe.     If however this was the sense in which he af
  firmed zoophytes to be moving creatures that have life, I wag
  mistaken' in saying that he called them locomotive.                 I was not
  aware that he was playing upon words, and therefore misappre
  hended his meaning.
      But F.> E      s affirms that he had precluded any misappre
 hension     of  his words    by a restrictive clause.      He says he had
 acknowledged that the motion of zoophytes " does not precisely
 accord with the idea (of locomotion) which Dr. Prichard thinks
     * Lamarck,,  to whom F. E       s appeals in his last letter, as to a high
 authority, excludes zoophytes from all share even    in sensibility, aud terms
 them spathic animals. The propriety of this term     may be questioned, bat
 the opinion which led to its adoption seems to be     founded on very strong
 facts.
                                                                            the

                    On the Cosmogony       of Moses.                     1   13
the   original text of Genesis conveys."        If these words (of loco
motion) were to be found in the original passage referred to,
I should acknowledge that the sense now imputed to it might
be discovered ; but as they now make their appearance for the
first time, the case is somewhat different.       In my preceding letter
I had defined the sense which I attributed to the Hebrew words
more strictly than before, and had mentioned that they convey
the idea which the LXX express by the phrase ?cu« kgweru.               It
was natural that I should suppose that F. E                 s referred to
this passage, and not to my first letter, in which I had adopted
the less definite translation of " locomotive animals."
    I had hopes, as Mr. Horn seemed inclined to enter into the
controversy, of escaping any further trouble on the question,
whether the testacea are locomotive animals ; but as F. E                 s
still perseveres in urging that point, I must inform him that he
has been fighting all this time against a mere man of straw, a
phantom of his own imagination.             In my first paper on this
subject, I observed in general terms that zoophytes and testacea,
not being locomotive animals, are excluded from a place in the
 creation of the third day.
     I wa§ fully aware that there were some exceptions to this re
mark ; but as they are known to every body, and bore no relation
 (asI   shall presently prove) to the question in which    I    was inter
ested,  I  did not thinkit   necessary to notice them.       If F.
                                                                 E            s
 had at first candidly conceded the truth of my observations as
 far as they applied to zoophytes and the greater number of the
 testacea,  I   should immediately have saved him the trouble of
any further discussion on this topic.           But on account of the
 charaeter which the controversy between us speedily assumed,                I
 thought    it quite suparfluous to make any explicit answer to his
 remarks.      Since, however, lie perseveres, and at length asks me
a   categorical question on the subject,       I  have only in reply to
 congratulate     him   on having    made it   appear,   after consulting
  authorities, as he says, that snails crawl.          I    willingly con
  cede the point,   and  beg to  assure  F.
                                          E        s  that
                                                        I    never enter
  tained any doubt upon the subject.
     But F. E. has gained no advantage over me           by  proving that
  some of the testacea are locomotive animals.           In order to form
  an exception to the coincidences     I     have traced between the
  succession of epochas in Nature and in the Mosaic Cosmogony,
it   would be neeessary to show that vestiges of these creeping
  testaceous animals are to be found in those formations which               I
  have referred to the first period of the organized creation.       This,
1    believe, he will find
                        a    difficult undertakmg.      The fact   is,that
   although many bivalvular shells are contained in the rocks which
   belong to this sera, there are very few univalves, and those which
      Vol. 48. No. 220. August 1816.                   H              have

114      ,            On the Cosmogony     of Moses.
have been found are of the class termed pelagian or oceanic, and
appear evidently from their structure never to have furnished a
dwelling to creeping mollusae.         If F. E      s can mention one
which properly belongs to the class designated in the 21st and
22d verses of the first chapter of Genesis, or which contained a
progressive, walking or creeping animal, I shall admit the case
to be an exception to the coincidences I have pointed out.
     It is evident that these coincidences depend, in a great mea
sure, on the sense of that passage in the Cosmogony which re
fers to the creation of aquatic animals.         tn the first period the
vegetable tribes were produced; to which I suppose some animal
species exhibiting the phsenomena of animal life in a low degree
to have been associated, but onlv such as are very remote in
their nature from the orders of aquatic animals, which are de
signated as beginning to exist in the next period.             These last
 are whales or fishes,   and  those creatures which are termed in our
 English translation    "  moving creatures that have life."
     I have compared most of the passages in the Hebrew Scrip
 tures in which the words thus translated are to be found, and I
 fmd their sense to be somewhat more definite than I at first ap
 prehended, being misled by the authority of the version above
 mentioned.       The exact meaning was pointed out in my letter
 published in the Philosophical Magazine for April, and is clearly
 expressed by the words used by the LXX JJcua Ig^sra.               This 1
 shall now prove by a sufficient number of references.
      The passages in which the creatures are designated, whose
 nature is the subject of dispute, are the twentieth and twenty-
 first verses of the first chapter of Genesis.
      In the twentieth verse we read
                   : nvr xssi     f«j crEn irw
 which in the literal translation of Pagninus is rendered " reple-
  Ficent aquae reptile animae viventis."                         •
      In the twenty-first verse the creatures which had been pro
  duced are termed                                             ,
            j tsnah "ran© nm rwsmn rwvt                mi
  "animam viventem repentem quam repere fecerunt aquae."
      The distinguishing terms are           in the twentieth verse,    and
   JltJd     in the twenty-first.
      The word         in the twentieth verse is rendered by the LXX
  by the Greek word k^wsra..        The exact meaning of it is disco
   vered in the eleventh chapter of Leviticus, verse 20h, which is
   rendered in the English translation, "All fowls that creep,
   going upon all four, shall be an abomination to you."!         Here also
   the LXX use the word k^itera..                            I
      The sense is equally displayed in the twenty-ninth verse of
  'the same chapter, which is translated, " These things shall be
                                                                    unclean

                            On ths Cosmogony         of Moses,                    ,   115
    unclean to you among the creeping things that creep upon th«
    earth ; the weasel, the mouse, the tortoise after his kind."
        In Genesis vii. ver. 21. it     is rendered          "creeping things" in
    English, and IpreTov in Greek.
        The term applied to these aquatic animals in the twenty-first
    verse, viz.              occurs in the twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, ami
    thirtieth verses of the same chapter, and in each of these places
    is rendered by the LXX egirera, and "creeping thing" in the
    English translation.
         It is found in Psalm civ. ver. 20. " It is night wherein all the
,   beasts of the forest do creep forth."
         It occurs in Deuteronomy iv. ver. 18. " The likeness of any
     thing that creepeth on the ground."             In the LXX we have
               0        hit TYjS yijf.
         Both words occur in Leviticus xi. ver. 44. " Neither shall
     Egff£T0V    EgTTcJ
    ye defile yourselves with any creeping thing that creepeth
     upon the earth."          The noun is yitt? and the verh VJET\.    The
    LXX      have to. if-Ktra, to. xivoufte'va   £7ri Trjs   yijj.
        It thus appears from parallel citations,   chiefly from the Pen
    tateuch, that the terms employed in describing this part of the
    fifth day's creation mean strictly " creeping or walking animals."
    We advance on safe grounds when we make an author the in
    terpreter of his own words.
        This interpretation is further confirmed by the old versions
    made before the Hebrew language was altogether extinct; viz.
    those of the LXX and of the Targumists,             indeed, the latter
                                                                 if,
    can be called versions.        have already shown that the LXX
                                   I
    constantly use the word IgTrera.      Both the Targums, Onkelos,
    and Jonathan translate Hyt2i~\ and                         by
                                                       the Chaldee word
    SJTn which also occurs      in  Genesis vii. ver.    and in Levit. v.
                                                                     8.

       creeping things."
        It seems therefore unquestionable that the animals which
    Moses asserts to have been called into existence in the waters
    during the fifth period, are designated by him as whales (viz.
    fishes), and all the creeping things or reptiles which inhabit this
    element.
        It  very remarkable that M. Cuvier has shown in the course
             is
    of his wonderful geological researches, which entitle him to the
    highest rank among the naturalists who have yet lived, that the
    remains of oviparous quadrupeds, or reptiles properly so called,
    make their first appearance in the crust of the earth exactly in
    the same period with those of fishes.   This   another instance  is
    of the remarkable coincidences which display themselves be
    tween the records of Nature and those of Moses    and am per          ;   I
    suaded that the more these records are scrutinized, the more
                                       H  2                                   agreement

agreement will be found between them, by those persons whose
minds ara not too contracted to be capable of comprehensive
views, or of surveying facts on a great scale*.
    F. E      s has observed, that the points in discussion do not
require  that  he should offer any opinion on the historical facts
which determine me to believe that Moses was not the original
author of the Cosmogony.      This seems to me somewhat strange.
Let us suppose the fact to be conceded, in the proofs of which
       —
F. E— s is in no wise interested, that a record of the creation
existed before the age of Moses, which contained nearly the same
account as that in Genesis, and let us consider what inferences ne
cessarily follow from this concession.     First, if the latter was
derived from revelation, we can scarcely refuse to allow the same
origin to the former, when we consider how nearly they agree.
Let any person compare the Etruscan Cosmogony cited in
p. 114, vol. xlvii. with that of Moses, and say if they ware derived
from distinct sources.    But if a revealed record of these events
already existed, where could be the necessity of a new revelation ?
The old precept," Nec deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus in
cident," forbids such a supposition.       Again, if such a record
existed, derived and known to be derived from revelation, there
ft no essential difference between the case of Moses, who com
piled his narration from        and that of the Evangelists, who
                                 it,
framed genealogies from previously extant documents.              St.
Matthew could no more ascertain infallibly the correctness of
the documents from which he compiled, than Moses could un
erringly discriminate what was authentic from what might be
superadded in the revealed record transmitted                by
                                                      the Patriarchs.
The cases are parallel, notwithstanding F.           s's repeated at
                                                     E
tempts to prove the contrary.        To suppose either or both of
those writers endowed with an infallible power of discriminating
the true from the false,     to attribute to them that very sort of
                                is
inspiration against   which  F.        E from some unaccountable
                                               s,
reason, has so particular an objection.    For my own part,       can I
as readily admit one sort as the other     and  ; observe that most

testimony of the Scriptures adopt the hypothesis which           have

just stated.
    Thus far concerning the consequences which flow from the
 facts which F.  E         does not care to dispute.

time of Moses, it is scarcely worth while to comment.                  It is cer
tainly   as  probable    that  it  should  be   revealed to   the patriarchs in
the first ages, as to Moses who could not have any particular in
terest in it.      The most important point is the proof oi this posi
tion. In my paper published in February (vol. xlvii. p. 1 1 1 etseq.)
I adduced facts which appeared to me to warrant the conclu
sion I drew from them; and I am confident that any person who
will consider them will not find them without force.                     I could
have adduced a greater mass of evidence, but I thought it un
necessary.        If however any of your readers is disposed to investi
gate the subject, I refer him to a work in which, since my last
letter appeared, 1 have seen it amply discussed.                I allude to the
Rev. Mr. Faber's work on the Origin of Pagan Idolatry ; fifth
chapter on Heathen Cosmogonies.
    Perhaps it is scarcely worth while to remark, that F. E                    s,
who has prudently declined entering into this question, has in
his last letter so far forgotten himself, as to pronounce at once
the whole ground of the opinion I maintain to be a vague and
visionary conjecture.          On this proceeding I shall make no com
 ment.

 XXXI.       On Optic Vision;        with a few Remarks on the Animad~
    versions    of F. E           s on  the Author's former Communica~
    tions   respecting the Cosmogony of Moses. By Mr . Andrew
    Horn.
                                 To  Mr.    Tilloch.
 Sir, — -    In   the prosecution of my inquiries into the Mosaic
 Cosmogony, the subject of vision, in connexion with an inquiry
 into the agency of light and production of colours, greatly en
 gaged my attention.          Almost, every thing of antiquity that has
 reached us on vision, is hypothetical.              Nothing truly scientific
 appears to have been known, relative to the manner in which
 it is accomplished, before Alhazen, in the twelfth century, pub
 lished his Treatise on Optics.           Porta and others afterwards con
 tributed    to advance    the  science,   by discovering the use of certain
  parts  of   the   organ ;   but    the  mathematical      genius of Kepler
  made the capital discovery, that           the  retina is  the canvass upon
  which the picture of the external objects is painted.                 Schiener
  ;>hortly after demonstrated its truth, by publicly exhibiting mi
  niature pictures of the opposite objects upon the retina of an
                                         H3                                  eye.

1   18                        'On   Oplic Vision,
eye,     stripped   behind    of its sclerotica and choroid membrane.
The retina being considered          a propagation of the substance of
the optic nerve, its claims as the true seat of vision were never
questioned till Marriotte, from his investigations into the struc
ture of the organ, and optical experiments, rejected them in fa
vour of the choroides.     Hence the famous "controversy com
menced between him and Pecquet, who vindicated the rights
of the retina against his hypothesis. The experiments and ar
guments were so balanced, that scientific men were for a time
divided in their opinions.   The hypothesis of Marriotte, how
ever, at length fell into disrepute, and the general opinion ever
since has been, that the retina is the proper seat of vision.
    However, after a careful examination of the various parts of
the organ, and close investigation of the phenomena attending
various and repeated experiments, I have been induced to assign
the chief function in vision to the base of the optic nerve, and to
conclude that the optic images are formed by caustic reflection,
and exhibited in the middle of the vitreous humour; and thus
the optic impression and position of the tangible object are re
conciled*. Among a variety of reasons and experiments, 1 have
adduced the well known experiments of Daniel Bernoulli and
 Le Cat, but especially the famous experiment of Marriotte made
with the patches upon the wall, as confirming the theory almost
beyond the shadow of a doubt.          Since the publication of my
work, 1 have understood that some have questioned the truth of
the theory.     As a further confirmation of        it,
                                                   made the follow
                                                      I

 pale green colour; the middle one was ten inches in diame
ter; the two others were each about two inches                 in
                                                           diameter,
 and placed at two feet from the centre of the middle paper.
On retiring with my right eye closed, and the left eye directed
to the paper on the right hand, when at the distance of nearly
four feet from the wall, the obscurity of the middle object was
first indicated          by
                      the disc becoming invisible except        small
                                                                    a
white ring; but from the unsteadiness of the eye in its distorted
state,   Ifound     very difficult to make the ring appear perfectly
                    it
 annular; its sphericity would now be seen interrupted in the
upper part, in an instant       would change to the lower part, and
                                  it
in the next instant the interruption would be on one side or the
other.     When had retired about three inches further,

objects,  which were still visible, appeared of a uniform colour.
Knowing that the pupil is always, except in myopes, dilated in
obscure light and when viewing dark objects, I now darkened
the chamber to a considerable degree ; and instead of the white
central paper oi ten inches, used in the former experiment, I
substituted a black paper sixteen inches in diameter.     Retiring
as before, I arrived at the former distance of four feet, which I
had marked, and now completely lost sight of the central black:
object   ;   whilethe wall and the extreme papers were seen the
.same as in the former experiment.            If any thing were wanting
 to confirm the truth of the theory,           nothing can be required
more demonstrative than this experiment ; wTiich shows, what I
have already proved in the work itself, that the pupil is the
cause of this defect in vision, and not any insensibility in the
lose of the optic nerve ; an hypothesis that introduces a most
unaccountable anomaly into the nervous system.
    Before I lay down my pen, allow me to make a few remarks upon
the animadversions that have appeared in the Philosophical Ma
gazine, upon some minor parts of my former communications.
I confess I am by no means partial to " the cramle repetita,"
with which your correspondent F. E                s so fondly anticipates
being treated.      It has generally been found, where the appetite
for this dish has been indulged, it has .ended in an incurable
 cacoethes.    When replies and recriminations are multiplied,
 without any thing new being elicited, it is pretty evident thai
one of the parties, at least, is prompted by something else than
regard for truth.      Mr. F. E         s, in his reply to Dr. Prichard*,
 has imputed to me the opinion,          that Moses in writing the Ge
nesis was influenced by        "  a circuitous inspiration;" a charge
which I. defy all the art of sophistry to extract from any thing
 I have written. I shall not fatigue your readers by bringing them
 over the accumulated rubbish, through which they have been, so
 often. dragged already, in order to determine in whose premises
 error lies ; but shall point out the particular parts in the ground-
 plan which have been infringed.           Moses, in.so many words, has
 declared that the. universe had a begiiming,afid that this earth,
 with all its inhabitants, was . formed within so many periods of
 time.    The necessary inference     is,  that these events never could
 have been known, but     by    a revelation from the Creator himself.
  But heathen nations, as. well as the Hebrews, were, at the time
  Moses wrote, in possession       of certain accounts of the origin of
  the vworld.   From this grand principle, common to the Cos
                          ,
  mogonies, in connexion with     a   few less remarkable coincidences,
 it  has been inferred, that, .some account of the beginning of things
                      *   Pbil, M»g.No..219,,p.,19.
                           "  '
                                  H   4                              had

    120                            On Optic Vision,
     had been commumcated by the Creator to some person or per
     sons bef ore the age of Moses. Mr. F. E            s here calls for direct
    proof :
              " There   is in Scripture,"  he says,
                                                     "  neither hint nor trace
     of anv revelation concerning the creation anterior to Moses."
     Thus, by throwing the onus prolandi, in this negative shape,
     upon the shoulders of those who believe a revelation to have been
     given anterior to the time of Moses, he imagines that he has
     relieved himself of some portion of the difficulties under which
     he labours in his attempt at proving the Genesis a fiction. But,
     in the present case, he demands a species of evidence which the
     subject by no means requires.         The question         which of these
                                                              is,
     propositions    isthe more probable, — that different nations have
     ivithout a revelation obtained the notion that the world had a
     beginning, or that they derived this notion from some common
    source, which Moses did not think necessary to mention             ?    Stu
    pidity itself would blush to hesitate between the              two  proposi
     tions.
     I    now remark that the reasoning of F.         E         s  upon revela
     tion and inspiration     is altogether fallacious.       He argues as     if
     the terms really were synonymous and equivalent.                  Luke was
    inspired   to write  the  Acts  of the Apostles   ; and,  like   Moses  with
    respect to the Pentateuch, he was an eye-witness to many               of the
    facts which he relates but there was no revelation made to him.
                              ;
    I  could perhaps conceive, in one sense or another, what            a   per
    son meant, should he tell me of          a   circuitous revelation        but
    when he talks of "
                                                                           ;
                              circuitous inspiration,"
                              a                           I  candidly confess,
       do not comprehend what he intends         by the terms.       The sacred
                                 "
    I
    history  informs   us   that    Moses   was  learned   in  all  the learning
    of Egypt   ;"  and therefore        may fairly be supposed that he was
                                       it
    conversant with the Egyptian and other heathen Cosmogonies                 ;
    and he certainly was also acquainted with the account of creation
    current among his own people.            Now whether we suppose the
    revelation,      which this subject became vulgar, to have been
                    by
    made to Noah, Enoch, or Adam, though the tradition might not
    have been greatly corrupted or altered among the worshippers
    of the true God yet we can scarcely suppose
                          ;                                    it  to have been
    transmitted through so many ages, to the time of Moses, entirely
x
    perfect.    If Moses then, under these circumstances, had chosen
    of his own accord to have written       a Cosmogony, he was perfectly
    at liberty to have made what use he pleased of the knowledge
    he had acquired — he might have related the Egyptian, or any
                          :
    other Cosmogony, in preference to the rest or he might have
                                                          ;
    recited the Hebrew Cosmogony with its partial errors                  or he
    might have borrowed from all, and composed " beautiful my-

world and formation of the earth, he was no longer left to his
own judgement or fancy.            Still, though thus restrained, it was
not necessary that his previous ideas should be erased.                     Hn
mind was now so controlled by divine influence as to relate truth
only, so disposed as implicitly to make whatever additions or
abridgements the Creator thought proper to dictate.                      If any
person chooses to call this a circuitous revelation, I will not
quarrel with him, because there is a sense in which I can under-
»tand it ; but if he will term it " a circuitous inspiration," I pro
test against this as absolute nonsense, and appeal to the king's
English.
    I have   to apologize to Dr. Prichard, for having inadvertently
exposed him to heavy censure from his opponent, who, it seems,
has fortunately discovered, through the medium of Nicholson's
Encyclopaedia,    that  " the  whole order of testacea are not desti
tute of locomotion."       Now any child, that ever saw a snail crawl,
or a crab walk upon the sea-shore, could have told him the
same thing ; though he might not indeed have been able to say,
how far certain species of the genus Ostrea can leap out of the
water, without consulting that scientific work.                 I have indeed
said*, "the production         of  zoophytes     and   testacea    is justly re
ferred by Dr. Prichard to this epoch, because they are destitute
of locomotive powers, which Moses positively assigns to all the
productions of the fifth period.         But where is it asserted by me,
that "the order of testacea is destitute of locomotion?" the
language which Mr. F. E                s has attributed        to me+.       He
readily perceived,    that  to use   the  simple   term   testacea    would, in
this instance, be of   no  service  to  his tottering   —  fallen  hypothesis ;
for, if but some species of testacea are destitute of locomotion,
ray phraseology is correct, though like Moses I may not have
been specific enough for so minute a philosopher.
    When Mr. F. E           s can no longer obtain
                                                            " the cramle re-

         "  from the twentieth verse of the Genesis of Moses, I
would recommend him to a similar case in the sixteenth propo
sition of the third book of Euclid's Elements.                                  ,
    Here he will find something precisely to his taste; for though
the proposition is fairly demonstrated, yet several impossible,
things seem to be demonstrable consequences of it.                      He will
 thus have the honour of proposing a few paradoxes to that ob
 stinate class — the mathematicians.         Let him however beware.- —
 Euclid has his admirers as well as Moses.             I can assure him, he
 will find their cramle repetita quite as high-seasoned, and much
 harder of digestion than any he has had from the cosmologists.

     tiania in Norway.            By Leopold Von BucHf.
  The      collection of minerals belonging to the University of Co
  penhagen is in fact very considerable, and, as might be expected,
  every thing belonging to the north is found here in extraordinarv
 beauty.       Arendal's epidote, of an extraordinary size ; scapolite,
 crystals of yellow titanium.            There fossils are first seen here in
 perfection.        I  never  saw   such beautiful and large zircon crystals
 from the syenite of Friedrichsvaern as in this collection.               All the
 pieces are excellently kept, which is seldom the case in such
 large collections; and it may not be amiss to inform those who
 before were ignorant of that circumstance, that Professor Wad,
 whose merit is so great, belongs to the Wernerian school.
     The royal collection in Rosenburg is also one of the most re
 markable and distinguished; not from the plan of the institution,

for it is   within   these few years only,     or, more properly speaking,
since the direction       of Professor Wad, that the enlargement and
arrangement of the collection have been conducted on any thing
like a scientific principle ; but on account of the monstrous and
colossal size of the specimens. There are pieces of Kongsberger
native silver, a foot in length, and from six to eight pounds in
weight.        A mass of silver in its natural rock, said to be worth
ten thousand dollars, is in truth by no means remarkable.                   But
 the calcedony of Iceland is of a most extraordinary magnificence.
 The drops of calcedony hang from the top to the bottom of the
 piece, like inch thick pillars behind one another.              Many remain
 in the middle, and do not reach the bottom*.                  The quantity of
 zeolite is immense.          A piece of amber from Jutland, placed on
 a velvet cushion, is little inferior in size to that in the Berlin col
 lection.      Large pieces of geyser sinter, which the collection
 latelv received from Iceland, were almost in the state of con-
 choidal opal.        Besides these magnificent specimens, the collec
 tion possesses      as great a treasure of choice and well-preserved
 northern fossils from Arendal as the cabinet of the University,
  since the beautiful collection       of Manthey, the counsellor of state,
  was   purchased and brought to Rosenburg.                This department is
  so complete, that it is almost unequalled.              It were to be wished
  that the same provision was made for those who wish to obtain
  by means of ocular inspection a knowledge of the composition
  of the mountains of the Danish dominions, which are better
  known.       But we look in vain for specimens of rocks in any col
  lection of Copenhagen.           The appearance of the lime-stone used
  in Jutland or in Faxo ; the stone in which the Kongsberg mine
  was formerly wrought ; or the figure of the large rocks on the
  west coast of Norway at Bergen or in Nordland, we seek in vain
  to discover either from a series or from individual               specimens ;
  and yet it would be so easy, and at the same time so princely,
  to form in a royal collection something like a picture of the in
  terior of the whole dominions.
      Professor Schumacher has also made a very beautiful and com
  plete collection of Norwegian fossils ; among them he has many
  things which are not to be found in other cabinets.                   I shouid
  doubt the possibility of showing          more   beautiful  and  distinct  spe4
  cimens     of the levcite of Friedrichsvarn.              The crystals   are as
  large as the leucite of Albano ; we can easily recognise the
   double octahedral pyramid with four terminal planes ; and the
   white colour gives      it  a still stronger resemblance to the Roman
     * The calcedonies of Iceland and Feme are remarkable, not only .on
   account of their magnificence and extraordmary beauty, but also for the
   various curious arnd interesting forms they exhibit, ail of which, e\en the
   staiaethic,  I consider to be crystalline shoots.— -J,

  leucite.     They rest insulated on hornblende in the syenite, which
  contains zircon in such abundance.                   Yet in France there is a
  conviction that these crystals are not leucite, but analcim (Wer
  ner's cubicite).        The difference between these two fossils exter
  nally is indeed very trifling, and consists principally in the greater
  hardness of the analcim, and its less frequent tendency to foliated
              '
 fracture.       But in the chemical analysis they differ more.             Leu
 cite contains twenty-four pro cent kali, and analcim, on the other
 hand, ten pro cent of soda.                I cannot omit noticing that the
 appearance       of  this   ample  collection    of Arendal put me always in
                           -
 mind of     the   fossil     of Vesuvius.     The     analogy between them is
 great.     Here and there new and wholly unknown fossils were
 contained in primitive stones; and those which were known ap
 peared in forms seldom hitherto observed.                    But in both places
  thev are numerous, and heaped together to a degree which we
  seldom find in an existing bed; and were we to find all that the
  country of Arendal produces in such uncommon perfection at a
  distance from their first beds, and heaped together on the decli
  vity of a volcano like Vesuvius, we should be as embarrassed as
  we now are at the appearance of so many druses of nephelin,
  meionite, vesuvian, hornblende and felspar, in the granular lime
 stone on the sides of Vesuvius.              The first beds of these masses
 may    therefore     have    been  the  same     as a bed in micaceous slate,
 or gneiss like that of Arendal ;         and   in  this case, it must be sought
 westwards in the sea, or in Sardinia and Corsica ; for towards
 the west, the primitive rocks are to be found on the Italian
 coasts.
     The exotic articles possessed by M. Schumacher in his collec
 tion are numerous, but of no great importance.
     The treasures of the Great Royal Library are well known. But
 the excellent collection of books of Classen, which no stranger
 in Copenhagen can examine without envying, is much less
 known than it ought to be.                General Classen bequeathed not
only   his books     to  the   public, but   also a sufficient fund along with
them, part of which was dedicated to the erection of a suitable
building for the reception of the books, and the remainder to
provide a revenue for the increase of the collection.                 He chiefly
possessed historical books.             But the directors of the new insti
tution had the good sense to give up this department entirely to
the Great Library, and to confine themselves solely to natural
history, the arts, and travels. They wisely judged that in this
way alone it was possible for them to attain any thing like per
fection; and every one who wishes for other books, may find
them with more certainty in the Great Library.                      The conse
quence    is,   that in Classen's library we not only find the most
expensive botanical works and original travels, but also             a     more
                                                                   complete

                and Public Libraries   of Copenhagen.               125
complete collection    of even the most fugitive German and foreign
publications connected with these departments, than is any where
else to be met with.      This library possesses a yearly revenue of
four thousand rix dollars ; which is more than that of the Great
Library, and indeed than that of most of the public libraries of
Europe.
    In Copenhagen therefore there is no want of assistance from
books; and in this point of view it is worthy of the capital of
an extensive state.
    That the town is in general beautiful and well built, all travel
lers are unanimous in stating ; and of this we become soon con
vinced.    -After every fire, which has consumed whole streets,
they have been always rebuilt more beautiful and wide, and alto
gether on a more convenient plan, so that the town bears in
many places no resemblance to what it was before 1728, 1794,
and 1807.      Another species of magnificence cannot fail to strike
the inhabitant of a flat country,     which is little noticed in the
descriptions    of Copenhagen.     The  streets are almost everywhere
 at the sides paved with large oblong granite flags, and many of
the canals are wholly lined with flags of a monstrous size.             I
 conjectured at first, that they had been brought from somequarrv
in Norway; but I was assured by M. Wad that this immense
quantity was all derived from large masses on the coast of Zea
land.     This is a remarkable circumstance, and deserving of at
tention.     If so many large blocks are found in Zealand, they
must necessarily have made their way over the sea ; for there
are no granite mountains        in Zealand.      In whatever manner
 these blocks may have been driven over to Zealand, we may
easily conceive that they have been brought in the same manner
to Mecklenburg, Pomerania, and Brandenburg.             Large granite
and gneiss blocks are even seen on the smaller islands ; for in
stance, there are many on Femoe at Laaland.            These are still
 further proofs that all the granite of the plains in the north of
 Germany, however great the distance, has been torn from the
northern mountains, and not from the hills of Saxony or Si
lesia.    We are not in possession of facts sufficient to enable us
 to develope the wonderful revolutions of nature, by which this
 may have been effected ; but every observation brings us nearer
to the causes, and in a few years perhaps they may be disco
 vered.
    The Gymnasium in Christiania, which bears the modest ap
 pellation of school, may be mentioned with distinction as a public
 establishment for education.      Its merits are proved by the abili
 ties of the teachers, and the progress made by the scholars.          It
 supplies to a certain extent the want of a university in Norway,
 which has been so often warmly, but, however reasonably, always

  fruitlesslv, demanded by the Norwegians, as a literary centre in
  the interior of a remote kingdom, which constitutes more than a
  third part of the whole monarchy.      The school, which is situated
  in the best part of the town, is a large building, and has a .serious
  and dignified external appearance.        It contains, besides the
  rooms adapted for tuition, several collections, which are not very
  distinguished, and the librarv, which is not more ornamental
  than useful and profitable to the town.      This library is open to
  the citizens,  and  contains perhaps not many rare, but a num
  ber 'of useful works.    It owed its origin chiefly to the collection
'
  of Chancellor Deichmann, who died about twenty years ago, and
  who distinguished himself by bis works on the modern history of
  Norway. This patriotic individual bequeathed his library to the
  town of Christiania, well judging that it would there be pro
  ductive of the greatest benefit.    In the same spirit several other
  more recent libraries have been incorporated with it, for which
  they are partly indebted to an Ancker ; and they now continue
  unremittingly to procure the most important productions of the
  German and Danish press, so far as the school-funds, which are
  by no means scanty, will allow them.         How few towns of the
  same extent, or in the same situation, can congratulate them
  selves on such a library !      And as it is not suffered to remain
  idle, we can hardly doubt that it will greatly contribute to the
  diffusion of knowledge.
      The excellent Military Academy, which directly fronts the
  school-house, is an object no less remarkable.         It is certainly
  one of the best institutions in the Danish state, and has been the
  means of supplying the Danish army with a great number of
  useful and accomplished officers.     It is a pleasant sight to see
  the hundred cadets, who generally receive an education here,
  either assembled together, or in the streets.         Their vivacity,
  their blooming complexions, and their dignified behaviour, dispel
  at once every idea of constraint ; and we soon see when we enter
  the building that it is a much nobler institution than similar
  schools for cadets generallv are : yet the institution is almost
  wholly supported by the contributions of wealthy individuals.
  The academy is indebted for the house (an elegant little palace,
  and perhaps the most beautiful in the town,) to the liberality of
  the Ancker family, by whom it was formerly inhabited ; their
  instruments and books are legacies ; and only two years ago
  it received from the Chamberlain, Peder" Ancker, the rich library
  and instruments which devolved to him on the death of his bro
  ther Penult Ancker.       r>y these means they have been enabled
  from a mathematical school, which was the origin of the insti
  tution, to convert it into an academy, in which the young officers,
  besides the mathematical sciences and drawing, are diligentlv

foreign languages.       During several days of the week they prac
tise leaping, climbing, rope-dancing, swimming,        and other ex
ercises, which Professor Treschow in Copenhagen          very appro
priately calls the luxury of education ; but a good officer will
perhaps not regret the time he spent in such exercises.        It is an
excellent regulation, that the cadets neither lodge nor eat in the
house ; they are boarded with respectable people of the town,
for the purpose of avoiding the monkishness of a secluded edu
cation.    They wish to bring the young people as much as possi
ble into contact with the world, and to break them at an early
 periodof the narrow-mindedness which so circumscribed an occu
pation as that of a soldier has a necessary tendency to produce.
 The correctness of these principles has been confirmed bv ex
 perience, even in the short space of a few years.     So long as the
 state of Denmark deems it necessary to keep up a great army,
 and to dedicate so much of its attention to that object, it were
heartily to be wished that all the Danish officers found such a
school for their    formation   as the Military Academy in Chris-
 tiania.
 XXXIII. Account of some further Electrical Experiments
                   ly M. Dje Nelis, of Mechlm,
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —    I  have lately made an experiment which tends to
 prove   the simple current with an apparatus not insulated by
 disks. — On placing the chain which conducts the fluid to the
 ground, in communication with a large plate of lead placed on
 the table of the apparatus, and applving the hand during the
 detonations of the small bottle, we feel a succession of small
 shocks : it then occurred to me to place the other hand on the
 lower cushion of the apparatus, when I instancy felt the fluid
 running towards the disk.        Here I said to myself, Chance has
 confirmed to me the circle of circulation, announced to me
 fourteen years since by M. Lugt, a Dutch philosopher, in con
 sequence of several very ingenious experiments made by an ap
  paratus perfectly insulated.     The apparatus of Mr. Singer is
  very well adapted for repeating the two first experiments of Mr.
  Lugt, which seem to me to prove incontestably, that the floor
  does not furnish the fluid to the disk, but that the wood of the
  table, and that which supports the disk between the cushions,&c.
 are the invisible conductors, which refurnish the fluid excited by
                                                             friction,
                                                                    .

 friction, and make it a continual circle by the intermedium of
 the conductor, while the rotation of the apparatus lasts.
    For the first two experiments, it is only necessary to fix a
 large copper wire with a well polished knob in the lower metal
 of the conductor, which is supported on the column of glass ;
 and a second similar wire in that which supports the cushion on
 the second column of glass.        These copper wires in a perfect
 state of insulation ought to bend on the side opposite to the
 handle, in order that we may remove or bring close these
 knobs to the distance proper for the experiments. For instance,
 for the first experiment, which seems to prove that the best iso
 lated apparatus produces the same number of sparks, and at the
 same degree of strength, as when the cushions communicate
 with tb ~ floor, we bring the knobs to the distance at which we
 obtain tue strongest sparks.     If we turn the cylinder for a whole
 hour, neither the number nor strength of the sparks will be di
 minished ; and, as I have observed, it will be the same vyhen we
 communicate alternately with the cushion and the conductor.
    In the second experiment Mr. Lugt places a bottle on an in
 sulator : a crooked wire which communicates with the external
 coating of the bottle, presents as in my experiment its knob be
 fore that of the interior coating, in order to obtain a detonation
 at the time of each saturation.      Present in the state of insula
 tion  the knob  of the  copper wire  which   communicates with the
 cushion, against    the stalk of the  exterior coating of the bottle,
 and that of the conductor against that of the interior.        If the
 distance of the knobs is proper for obtaining the strongest de
 tonations, their force and their number will neither augment nor
 diminish any thing in the insulation of all the apparatus, except
 by making a communication alternately with the ground, either
 by means of the cushion or the conductor: consequently Mr.
 JjUgt concludes, the floor contributes nothing to the charge of
 theLeyden phial; and the attraction which acts, is owing to the
 disk, which tends to resume its equilibrium, and attracts towards
 it the fluid excited by friction. In a note Mr. Lugt compares
'this circulatory action to the Voltaic pile.
     When I mentioned, in two of my letters to M. De la Metherie,
 the experiments of the Leyden philosopher (and which were
 published in the Dutch language in two small volumes in 1802
 and 1803), I also admitted the theory of the two fluids: I en
 deavoured in consequence to make them bend to the two cur
 rents.    Several subsequent experiments have made me abandon
 this theory for that of Franklin modified.
    What gives me most pleasure is to find a confirmation by facts,
 of the theory of elective attractions, and the tendency which all
                                                                bodies

 either by fermentation, friction, or simple contact.             I am glad
 therefore that I had delayed putting the finishing hand to the
 account of my experiments, because the theory of the Leyden
  phial by the action of a single fluid becomes thereby much sim
 pler, as well as many other facts.          I think I shall he able by thfe
  end of October to send a full account of my principal              experi
  ments.     In the mean time I shall describe the way in which I
 arrange a non-insulated apparatus.
     I place a wine bottle or flask on an insulator having two stalks
  and knobs bent inward, to charge on one hand the interior coat
  ing, and on the other to detonate on the knob of a third stalk
  screwed into the metallic stand of the insulator.              Instead of
  placing   there  a tube  with  metal    wires  and  water,  place in con
  tact a copper rod to which a chain is to be fixed to draw away
  the fluid on a laminated plate of lead two or three feet long.
  At the end of this plate fix with wax a large copper knob as
  high as the rod of a Leyden jar, of the same siae with the firsti
  in such a way that its knob may present itself.facing that of the
  roll of lead.    We begin by searching for the distance, in order
  to obtain the strongest detonations from that which communi
 cates with the first conductor: afterwards, having attached with
 soft wax a gold or silver wire to the metal of the rubber, in order
  to fix in the same way the other end against the exterior coating
  of the second bottle ; we leave a separation of about a line be
  tween the interior knob and that of the roll of lead.             This ar
  rangement     establishes  the  circle,  which    1 obtained   by my two
 hands.
     If we turn     the disk or the hon-insulated cylinder of a eom-
  rnon  apparatus with a supporter and a wooden table, on which
  the roll of lead is placed, the fluid which we shall see incessantly
  passing along the chain will not pass to the floor, but will pro
  ceed by affinity or elective attraction by the metallic circle, al
 though the latter is interrupted in the first place by the space
 between the two copper knobs, and afterwards by the thickness of
  the glass of the second coated bottle.           This passage charges it
  with sufficient strength to exhibit the spark set out by an ex
 citer, and to give the commotion to make it be felt with force.
  It appears to tne, that this experiment is one of the best adapted
 for demonstrating the elective affinities.          There is at every jet
  a stronger spark between the two knobs ; but it appears to me
  worthy of remark, that after a feeble charge, the attractive force
 can no longer overcome the resistance which the glass of this
 bottle opposes to the current by the gold or silver wire, and that
 St takes its ordinary course by the wood of the
                                                           tables and that
  which supports the disk.       From that instant not the least fluid

      XXXIV.      Instructions issued by the French Legislature             for
            obtaining a Patent {Brevet d' Invention) in France*.
             Motives which gave rise      to the System   of Patents.
    •It    has been always admitted, that it was as just as it was use
     ful  to the progress of the arts, to secure to inventers the pro
     perty of their discoveries; but to accomplish this in an advan
     tageous manner for themselves and for the publie was not so
     easily arranged.       Some wished that exclusive privileges should
                                                               '
     be granted them, the duration of which should be unlimited,
     while others thought that those privileges ought only to be tem
     porary.     Lastly, according to a third opinion, it was preferable
     to decree rewards to them, and to render their discoveries in
     stantly open to all. The administration frequently had recourse
     to this plan ; but as it involved the state in considerable ex
     penses, and did not always satisfy inventers themselves, it was
     necessary once more to inquire if there was any possibility of
    conciliating all interests.     This object was at length attained by
     the laws of the 7th of January and 25th of May 1791, which
    established brevets.       Titles of this description now secure, on
    the one hand, to artists the exclusive enjoyment of their disco
    veries, and give on the other, at their expiration, a very important
    guarantee, t. e. that of the preservation of several inventions,
    which without this plan would be imperfectly known, if not hid
    froiri the public altogether.
       Formalities to be observed by those who solicit Patents, and
                 Amount of the Sums which they must pay.
         The patents delivered by the present French Government bear
    no resemblance to the exclusive privileges which were obtained
    under the ancient monarchy : they are merely a certificate given
,  to an individual, of the declaration which he makes of having
    invented a machine, or a process, from the employment of whieh
        * Now that a free intercourse subsists between the two countries, it is
    to be presumed that these instructions will be found highly useful to those
   British patentees who wish to extend their invention, and secure the emo
   luments resulting from it in France.
  L
                                                                         a new

                   for  obtaining a Patent in France.              131
  a new branch    of industry is the result.    Three kinds of brevets
  are  issued; viz. invention, perfectionury , and importation.
     Patents of importation are granted to those who procure for
  our industry a process or machine known in foreign countries
  only.    The laws of the 7th of January and 25th of May not
  having determined in a positive manner the duration of these
  patents, an imperial decree of the 13th of August 1810 ordaina
  that it shall be the same with that of patents of invention.
     Improvements in the arts often form an invention as impor
  tant as the primitive discovery.     It was therefore proper to give
  an extensive property in them by a patent.        But if the French
  laws have gone this length, they do not regard on the other
  hand as improvements, any ornaments or mere changes of forms
  and proportions.     There must be an addition to the discovery.
     Several discoveries cannot be included in one brevet : each
 must be the subject of a particular petition.        In order to ob
 tain a title of this kind, the compliance with different formalities
 is indispensable.
     The claimant must, in the first place, deposit at the general
 secretariat of the prefecture of the department where he resides,
 a sealed packet, containing
     1. His petition to the minister of manufactures and commerce,
 to the effect of obtaining a brevet for five, ten, or fifteen years,
 according as he pleases.
    2. The memoir describing the means which he uses.
    3. Double sets of drawings signed by himself, or a model of
 the object of his discovery.
    4. An inventory, in duplicate signed by him, of the pieces,
 contained in the packet.
    He must besides pay a tax, more or less considerable, ac
 cording to the duration of the brevet, which cannot exceed fif
 teen   years.
    Three hundred      francs   (13/. 10s.) are paid for a brevet for
 five years.
    Eight hundred francs (36/.) for ten years.
    Fifteen hundred francs (67/. 10s.) for a brevet for fifteen years,
besides fifty francs (2/. 2s.) for the fees of making out the pa
tent.
    The law admits of the duration of brevets being extended : but
in order to obtain this favour, which is but rarely granted, a
royal decree is necessary.       A new sum is then paid in the above
proportions.
    The claimant must pay as a deposit with his papers, one half
of the tax.     He is allowed six months to pay the other half :
if not paid then, the patent falls to the ground. If patentees
wish to make any changes in their original petition, they must
                                  I 2                          deposit

132          Instructions issued  by the  French Legislature
deposit the description of their new method in the secretariat
of the prefecture and pay a second tax, which is twenty-four
francs (20i.) for the chest of brevets, and twelve francs for the
secretariat of the prefecture. The minister for manufactures and
commerce then delivers a second title, which is called Certificate
of additions, changes and improvements.
     Article 10, title 1st, of the law of the 25th of May regulates
the destination of the sums raised from the obtaining of brevets:
in the first place they go to pay the expenses of the making out
 and publishing the brevets, afterwardsto pay the expenses of print
ing and engraving the brevets which have expired; and if there
 js any surplus, it is to be employed to the advantage of the na
 tional industry.
     The secretary-general of the prefecture draws up a proces-
 verbal on the back of the packet placed in his hands, and he
 delivers to the petitioner a certificate of having so received it.
 The whole is afterwards addressed bv the prefect to the minister
 for manufactures and commerce.
     Principles established by      the Laws in the Deliverance    of
                            Brevets or Patents.
     It has   been seen above, that    in France there is nothing else
 than the certificate delivered to an individual of the declaration
 which he has made, of having invented a machine or process
 giving rise to a new branch of industry.         The administration
 does not judge, in fact, of the merit of the inventions for which
 patents are solicited.      Whoever has complied with the forma
 lities prescribed by the laws of the 7th of January and 25 th of
 May            may obtain them, as these laws enact expressly that
 they shall be granted on a simple tequest, and without previous
 examination.       Thus they may be applied for, for a process known
  to every body; the legislature having determined that they are
 Mill, and even prejudicial to those who have obtained them, if
 the object for which they have been granted has no existence;
  or if it has been known or practised before the date of the' bre
 vet.     In fact, if the discovery be purely imaginary, the expenses
  which the patent has cost are wholly lost.        If the process was
  already known, Article 16 of the law of the 7th of January pro
  nounces its nullity. The rights conferred by brevets are there
  fore conditional only, i. e. they secure an exclusive enjoyment
  only if, the patentee is really an inventor.     At the first glance,
  it may    be thought strange that titles of this nature should be
  given without previous examination ; but on reflection it will
  appear that it would have been very difficult to have found a
  mode better adapted to the end in view.         Several motives dic
  tated this line of proceeding : on the one hand, it was proper to
                                                                    save

                   for   obtaining a Patent in France.                133
save the    administration the embarrassment of a long and difficult
examination, and the responsibility of a judgement which, if it
had been unfavourable, might have given rise to charges of par
tiality or malignity: and on the other hand, to spare to inven-
ters the necessity of a communication,          the abuses of which they
might dread.        In fact, the previous examination would have
been completely to the disadvantage of artists, since they must
have communicated,         without any pledge of success, processes
the property of which might have been snatched from them.
It would have been necessary to have submitted these processes
to commissaries      following the same career with themselves, and
whose private interests, prejudices, or spirit of rivalship, might'
sway their judgements.          In the most favourable point of view,
the previous examination would therefore have had for a result
to dissipate some        absurd projects and some futile inventions:
but the public, if they had been allowed to appear, would soon
have done justice to them; and if the invention had been useless,
the patentee would have thrown away the expense of his brevet.
This motive is sufficient, we apprehend, to diminish in the minds
of artists, generally not very rich, the partialities which they
have for their discoveries, and prevent them from presenting pe
titions without any object.
    It remained to provide for the case in which a patentee should
make a dangerous use of his brevet, or one injurious to the
health or morals of the public.         The laws of the 7th of January
and 25th of May have in this case provided the means of de
priving him of a privilege which he might abuse, and even of
punishing him if he does.          They have hkewise pointed out the
steps   to be  taken  to  deprive  him  of a right which he has usurped
over some thing already known.
  Nullity   of Brevets,    and Authorities which decide upon them.
    The nullity of brevets is decided, according to circumstances,
by the administrative or judiciary authorities.          The minister of
manufactures and commerce decides upon it when the patentee
has not paid the balance of his fees, and when the inventor
(without assigning a good cause for his delay) has not brought
his discovery into use within the space of two years.           The tri
bunals are to judge upon the disputes which may rise between a
patentee who wishes to maintain his privileges, and any individuals
who pretend that his invention was known previously to tile date
of his patent, either by being in irse, or by description in a
printed work.       The interested parties must therefor* use all the
necessary    and  usual   means to obtain a decision.       In ordering
this measure to be pursued, the law considers the patent as a
property of which no person can be deprived without a due ob-
                                     1 3                        servarice

law of the 7th of January, and 10, 12, and 13, of Title II. of
the law of the 2.5th of May, regulate the method of proceeding.
 According to these articles, the infringers of a patent must be
brought before the Juge de Paix, who, after hearing parties and
their witnesses, pronounces his decision j which, if there be no
 appeal, is forthwith executed.
 Arrangements made since the Promulgation of the Laws             of the
                7th of January and 25th of May 1791.
     The laws of the 7th of January and 25th of May         are not the
 only   ones  which   have  been    issued upon brevets.   There  exists
 another law, dated the 20th of September 1792, which prohibits
 all granting of brevets for any other objects than those connected
 with the arts. Petitions for patents for fmancial and commercial
 operations gave rise to this prohibition.      Subsequently a decree
was published, which merely concerns the mode of delivering
 brevets. Previously they were granted by the supreme authority,
but thenceforth by the minister for manufactures and commerce.
 The certificate of the petition which he gives is only a provisional
 title : but it becomes definitive by the transmission to the pa
tentee of the article in the royal decree which applies to his in
 vention, when the brevets delivered in the course of every four
 months are published. Difficulties having arisen, whether, upon
 receiving the certificate of the application, the infringers of a
patent might be prosecuted, or if it was necessary to wait until
the patent had received the publicity procured to it by His Ma
jesty's proclamation, — a decree of the 25th of January 1807
puts an end to these doubts, hy enacting
                                                 " that the duration of
a patent begins to reckon from the date of the certificate which
establishes provisionally this privilege."        The same decree has
decided that the priority of invention, in case of contestation be
tween two patentees for the same object, is acquired by him
who has been the first that has deposited at the secretariat of
the department the documents which ought to accompany the
claim for a patent.      An arrangement in article 14 of Title II.
of the law of the 25th of May had prohibited the obtainiug of
 brevets by what is termed actions.          This was abrogated by a
 decree of the 25th of November 1806, on the representations of
 some individuals that it would prejudice the interests of inventers,
 inasmuch as it would deprive them of an easy method of taking
 advantage of their discoveries.
     It sometimes happens that patentees address themselves to
 Government, in order to obtain recompenses as the authors of
 important discoveries.      It is impossible to listen to all their de
 mands in this respect.      Article 1 1 of the law of September 1 2,
                                                                   1791,

  1791,   prohibits the granting of particular encouragements to
 those   who have provided themseves with a patent.                This reso
 lution was adopted, upon the consideration that no recompense
 is due to those inventers who reserve             to themselves the exclu
 sive enjoyment of their discoveries ; and that those persons only
 merit favour, who render their discoveries of free and common
 use, and thus add to the welfare of society, which all govern
 ments ought to seek incessantly to ameliorate.

                                 To  Mr.   TiLloch.
Sir, —
 number
           I yesterday          received, through Mr. Farey, the 21 /th
           of your valuable Magazine, containing a geological letter
of mine, addressed to my friend The Countess of Gosford, com
 municated to you by Mr. Farey, who, I suspect, received it from
my worthy and much lamented friend Mr. Johnes, member for
 Cardiganshire, lately deceased.
    That letter was nearly limited to facts — while <r the observa-
 lions to which Uiese facts give rise, and the inferences to be
drawn from them, were reserved for another letter," as I there
 state.
    This   second letter to my noble friend, I now transmit to you,
conceiving the first would be imperfect without it.
    Mr. Farey     has been pleased to add, and you to          publish/' Some
                                                        "
preliminary remarks and illustrative notes: — upon these I must
request you to indulge me in a few observations:
    Mr.Farey, after some very flattering expressions, is pleased to
lament cc that my attention should have been entirely diverted
from geology, my proper pursuit, in order perseveringly to at
tempt the conversion of English farmers, — a vain attempt."
    Vain enough no doubt, but not entirely desperate; for, while
the great body of the English agriculturists are obstinately pre
judiced against any thing they are not used to, and reject no
velty with contempt,
                            — yet still there are a few
                    "          quibus arte benigntt
                      Et  meliore luto finxit pracordia Titan.*'
We must not therefore complain,
                " Si reliquos fugienda patrum vestigia ducnnt."
    My exertions too have not been entirely fruitless.               Our own
East Indies enjoy the luxuriance of this succulent grass. St.

  136                     On Fiorin Grass.
 Helena cultivates it successfully. Denmark, with avowed gratis
  tude, exults in the complete establishment of this vegetable,
  equally productive in their cold climate and in our own.
  Russia too sent a Sc-avant to Clonfecle to learn Fiorin culture.
*    You must forgive me for obtruding; a few words on a subject
  which, though not in your immediate department, was intro
  duced in your own Magazine ; and for showing that, although
  it may not be entitled to the name of science, yet it has always
  been treated by me scientifically.
      You, Mr. Tilloch, who have occasionally published my geo
  logical papers, know that my method is simple.         1 lust establish
 facts, — then proceed to the inferences that follow directly froni
  them.      In agriculture I pursue the same line ; for, when my ob
  ject   was  to introduce the culture of Fiorin crass, by impressing
  on the world an high idea of its value, I commenced by esta
  blishing its curious properties as my facts; and then showed the
  important consequences that must necessarily follow its pretty
   general culture.
       As Mr. Farey states that I have failed, he brings the question
   to issue between the English, farmers and me.      J   must therefore
   first show that my facts were well established.
    ,  Seldom indeed has such a mass of evidence been produced.—
   It is now eight years since I first publicly invited inspection at
   Clonfecle; and every year since I have been visited by numbers,
   and among others by many of the nobility and prelates of iny
   country, who have unanimously in the face of the public borne
   testimony to the truth of mv Jact>, that is chiefly, immensity of
   produce, and superior quulity of my hay.
       I have now a better opportunity than ever of convincing those
   who are disposed to doubt the truth of my facts. The liberality
   of the Irish Farming Society has held out as encouragement,
   magnificent premiums for the best Fiorin crops in 1816. I know
   of several candidates ; and am myself one, though with little pro
   spect of success, as the premiums are limited to ntw crops, and
    my good grounds are all long under Fiorin.
       Here incredulity will be deprived of its usual excuses; care
   less inspectors, — partial to me — and chosen by myself!        But in
    this instance, the facts, thatis, quantity and quality    of produce?,
    will be established by persons nominated   by  the Farming Society,
    and jealous competitors will take care that  I   do not deceive.
       Secure of respectable judges,    I   shall avail myself of the
    wretched ground am limited to, and brave the English farmers,
                    I
    who, as Mr. Farey tells us, are not to be convinced; and     I   now
        June tell them, that in October
   of in
                                         1   shall exhibit crops of hay,
       superior quality, treble and even quadruple the quantity they

themselves are, used to raise,    with all their boasted agricultural
skill, from their best grounds ; while much of mine shall be found
growing on land, from most of which that same great agricultural
skill of theirs could not extract any produce — to wit, cold,
wet, peaty ground, burned down (for greed of ashes) to a tough,
viscid, incombustible moory clay ; — and also peat moss twice
cut out for turf, and now brought down to within twelve inches
of the perpetually stagnant water, and often flooded.
     My inspectors also will see, and I hope report (though
not for competition) that the rest of my meadows retain their
 usual value, and that my ninth and tenth successive         crops of
 Fiorin, growing on light dry upland ground, have not in the
 least fallen off.
     I like to taunt incredulity, and therefore tell these unbelieving
 farmers of Mr. Farey's, that the grass they reject, thrives, and
 luxuriates equally on the top of the mountain and bottom of
 the valkv; thanks to my noble friends the Marquises of Hert
 ford and Abercorn for enabling me to establish this important
fact, on their respective mountains.       Nor, taking the question
  a priori, is it unreasonable to ask these- sceptics to concede that
  this same Fiorin grass, already in possession, and almost ex
  clusively, of every green mountain in our islands, must, when
  fostered by man,— stimulated by manure, — and protected from
  its enemies, thrive and luxuriate in the same soil and elevation
  where it grows spontaneouslv without any of these aids.
      Had Mr. Farey's obstinate friends the faculty of drawing con
  clusions, they would soon find to what stupendous consequences
  this hardy habit of Fiorin must necessarily lead.
      Our mountains are desolate, because they will not produce
  food for man without manure — nor winter sustenance for his do
  mestic cattle, to afford him manure andmilk.        Give him hay in
   abundance (as Fiorin will rapidly and cheaply), all his difficulties
  vanish.    Hay produces milk and manure,      Hence potatoes, rye,
   and Hack oats.
      Great proprietors may soon restore the population of the
   mountain Highlands of Scotland.        Enable the holders of small
   tacks to supply themselves with hay, they cease to be claimants
   on shares of the widely extended pastures, or rivals of the wealthy
   graziers, and sheep feeders.    A very few acres in the glens and
   valleys will enable them to feed themselves, and to derive their
   .other necessaries from their domestic industry.
      What a field is here opened for the establishment of a manu
   facturing population ! Cheap land — food easily raised — fuel in
    abundance.    Nor is weighty capital required: — the attentive eye
   and fostering hand of the proprietor      are nearly all that is re?

XXXVI.          Experiments relaling              to the     Impurities    of   Hydrogen
      as   it   is   commonly obtained.            By M. Donovan, Esq.
       Read          to the      Kirwanian Society          ofDublin, May          15.
The      process employed for obtaining hydrogen              the decom   is
position of water               by
                          means of a metal.       For this purpose zinc
and iron are commonly used, with dilute muriatic or sulphuric
acid*.     But the gas thus produced            variable in some of its
                                                        is
properties   : its   odour,  and   the colour  of  its flame, are not al
ways the same           therefore contains foreign matter.
                        :   it
    Experiments which required very pure hydrogen compelled
me to pay some attention to its common impurities, and to the
best means of removing them.
  A    very small Woulfe's apparatus was arranged, the first bottle
containing caustic ammonia, the second lime-water, and the
third common water.              long continued stream of hydrogen
                                         A
was passed through this series, from the vessel in which             was            it
generating      and the pressure of several inches of water was ap
                ;
plied.    By this process, the ammonia acquired              fetid smell. a
When mixed with muriatic acid,             exhaled the odour of sulphu
                                                  it
retted hydrogen         and paper moistened in acetate of lead was
                            ;
blackened, when held over the fluid.          The lime-water contained
carbonate of lime         and when the clear fluid was poured off,
                                ;
and mixed with muriatic acid, a minute quantity of white pow
der was deposited, which when separated burned blue like sul
phur. The smell of the hydrogen obtained was,                         by
                                                            these means,
altered:   it had now an odour precisely like phosphorus.                                It
burned with        fine green flame whereas before
                    a                         ;            burned blue.
                                                                    it
  * The gun-barrel process   so very troublesome and difficult to manage,
                                         is
that,
   I   believe,    seldom resorted to.
                     it   is                           It
                                           affords, however,    very pure      a
hydrogen.        ,
                                                                                   Wishing

               Hydrogen   as  it is commonly obtained.                Vd9
    Wishing to try if hydrogen, procured by means of zinc, con
tain sulphur, I repeated the experiment with that metal.            Sul
phuretted hydrogen and sulphur were ohtained as before ; and
the gas gave the same smell and flame as the former.
    By repeating the process, with muriatic acid, it was proved
that the sulphur had not been afforded by the sulphuric acid.
And trials on different specimens of iron and zinc offered the re
sults already stated.
    Thus common hydrogen contains an admixture of sulphuretted
hydrogen which is not absorbed during the passage of the gas
through the water in which it is received ; and this admixture
affects both its smell and the colour of its flame.
   From these facts, it appeared that the water resulting from
the combustion of common hydrogen should contain sulphuric
acid.   A large quantity of hydrogen was therefore collected in
new dry bladders provided with pipes and stop-cocks,            and the
combustion was suffered to go on slowly, in a new and perfectly
clean globe, kept cool under water.           The water produced was
tested with muriate of barytes, which caused a precipitation ; it
^Iso reddened water tinged with violets.
   The experiment was repeated with this difference, that the
gas, previously to its reception into the bladders, was suffered to
remain over water for twenty-four hours, and was frequently
agitated.   In this case, the water produced, did not afford a pre
cipitate with muriate of barytes.
   During the revolution which took place in chemistry towards
the end of the last century, there was a controversy concerning
the product of hydrogen burnt in oxygen.          The advocates of the
new doctrine stated that the result is water.       The opposite party
maintained that an acid is the product.             Acid was, in some
cases, certainly found ; but it was conceived by the framers of
the new system to be formed by the combustion of a little azote,
from which it is difficult to free oxygen.           In other trials no
trace of acid could be detected.        The foregoing statements ren
der it probable that, when acid was produced, it might have been
the sulphuric, but so much diluted as to be difficult to recognise;,
and when there was no trace of acid, the hydrogen had perhaps,
lain so long over water that the sulphur was taken up entirely.
    The hydrogen, w-hich had been freed from sulphur and car
bonic acid, had a remarkable smell of phosphorus.            This might
be really owing to phosphorus,      for  some  kinds  of iron have been
proved to contain it ; or it might be owing to arsenic.           Either
 of these would be acidified by passing the impure hydrogen
through nitrous acid, and the gas might be obtained in a state
of purity.
   A long continued stream of the gaawas therefore       passed through
                                                                 a series

   140                Notices respecting New Books.
  a series of Woulfe's bottles, the first containing lime-water, the
  second nitrous acid, the third water, and the fourth dilute solution
  of sulphate of iron : from the last bottle proceeded a tube which
  plunged deeply in the water-cistern.       At the end of the process
  the first bottle contained carbonate and hydro-sulphuret of lime;
  in the second the nitrous acid was rendered colourless; the water
  of the third prevented the passage of nitrous acid vapour into
  the solution of sulphate of iron ; and this solution in the fourth
  detained a quantity of nitrous gas, as was shown by its olive co
  lour.   The hydrogen which came over when agitated with water,
 was destitute of smell.      When ajar of it was kindled, it burned
 gradually, but the li^ht was so faint and rare that, it had no co
  lour.    I was not prepared to take the specific gravity of this
  purified gas.
     The nitrous acid did not manifest the least traces of arsenic
  or phosphoric acid.       When evaporated to dryness, it left a por
  tion of matter too minute to ascertain the nature of.
     From the foregoing it appears that, in order to obtain pure
                                                                       '
 hydrogen, we must first agitate common hydrogen with lime-
 water during a few minutes, next with a little nitrous acid, after
 wards with dilute solution of sulphate of iron; and lastly, with
 water.      The gas is now entirely deprived of smell.
     For this purpose, a funnel the throat of which is fitted with a
 ground glass rod, its pipe being ground to fit the mouth of a
 large bottle, will be a convenient apparatus. When the fluids are
 to be poured out, it must be done by inverting the bottle under
 water, and withdrawing the funnel.

  Dec. 13, 18i5.      A paper was read by D. Wilson, Esq. ee On
some Liquid Combinations of the Oxymuriatic Acid, and their
Application to the discharging ofTurkey Red in Calico-printing."
  The Turkey red is not discharged by any of the oxymuriates
hitherto        employed,      but for this purpose oxymuriatic    acid      has
been used.     This produces many inconveniences.              It is highly
deleterious to the workmen.         By  acting on  the  metals of the press
employed    in   printing  with       it,
                                     black   spots  are occasioned    in the
stuff, and   its  texture      injured.
                                 is         Mr. Wilson found the dis
charging power of the oxymuriates to be in proportion to the
weakness of affinity between their constituents.          Hence he found
oxymuriate of alumina to answer the purpose, even in               ashorter
time than the acid, and without any of its inconveniences.                   It
has been since pretty extensively used.          He prepares       itby de
composing    clear  solution  of  oxymuriate of lime with solution of
alum.    In the same manner he recommends various other oxy
muriates to be prepared for the purposes of the arts, and points
out their application.

In consequence of Sir          George Caytcy's communication,       inserted
in our number for May, we have been favoured with a letter from
a gentleman of distinguished literary and scientific reputation.
 He is " inclined to believe that something useful to mankind on
the subject may be either positively or negatively ascertained,
 under the conduct of men of science."            He is willing to con
tribute    fifty  pounds for furthering any plan which may obtain the
sanction of a few men of the description to which he alludes.
     Sir, George Cayley has requested us to correct an error in the
 title prefixed to his last article, in which F.R.S. was affixed to
 bis name by mistake.           The fact was simply this: The Editor,
 who    was   obliged   to leave town for a few days, sent the commu
 nication without any title, along with some other articles to the
 printer to put to press in his absence ; and trusting to memory
 instead of looking at Sir George's previous communication, the
 printer committed the error complained of.

     I have of late paid particular attention to the manner in          which
 the solutions of salts are decomposed by reduced metals. We
 »ee a liquor thicker than water, separated from the solution ar.d
 approach the metal : then it disappears, and at the same instant
 the reduced metal shows itself in a state as if it had undergone
 fusion.       It is not to be supposed that the acid quits for some
 time the oxide, to admit of the latter taking up the oxygen by
 the decomposing metal ; for this would be granting too much ;
  and besides, the solution reacts at no period on the blue colour
 with which we stain it. We ought rather to conceive that the

waterof the solution, displaces from the decomposing metal hydro
gen, which approaches the decomposed salt, to place itself in the
room of its equivalent under the form of water, and peculiarly to
the water of oxidation of the oxide of this salt, whereby this
oxide is reduced, and that the acid adhering to this water is
substituted for the hydrogen, or takes the place of this principle,
and thus forms in every respect the new salt.                It is impossible
that the case' can be otherwise.            The metal is not fused, but it
is newly composed.           It is the action which takes place under
the pile, and wherever oxides are reduced without their oxygen
being hot enough to pass to another body. When the solution is
saturated with salt, the decomposition is slow or null : this is
 because the metal precipitated has not a free motion : but is this
requisite ?      I sav no: but free water is requisite for            and parit,
 ticularly   water  of solution    which       is

 The metals which are oxidated                  by

 reduced, and when they are so they form no arborescence.
     It has been discovered in Italy, that the tincture of salt of
 tartar dissolves phosphorus without decomposing                    or formsit,          a
 liquid phosphuret of its alkali          :and caustic lixivium diluted in
 alcohol operates the same solution.              Here we have in the first
 place   the  defect  of  water,   and afterwards    the affinity of water for
 alcohol, which hinders the phosphuret             from   being decomposed
 as soon as    it    formed.
                    is             But add more water, and particularly
 warm water, and instantly phosphuretted hydrogen gas appears.
 The alcohol contracts          avery intimate union with the strong                    al
 kalies, and the alcoholate of potash,            not the potassate of alco

      ;   I    think that       this union the alcohol acts like an oxide,
                                in
 and the potash like an acid, and becomes very intensely hv-
 drated.  I      once found large crystals in            very old tincture of
                                                               a
  salt of tartar: they were neuter on the vegetable blues: to the
  last they were at first salt and bitter, and afterwards very corro
  sive.    In the open air, when          Iwished to dry them they deli
  quesced, giving out          smell of alcohol, and nothing but caustic
                                a
  potash remained.         The little difference between the intensity of
  the alcohol and of the potash, makes this salt be so easily de
  composed, but      it    hydrated in the ratio of the combined energy

  furnished to me          by

 a  retort closed with      a piece of paper.          The infusion is then
passed through      a   woollen     sieve  ;   the  residue   washed in cold
 water, decanting    all   that  remains     suspended     in the water ; the
 latter portion is then to be infused in the same manner in pure
 water, and both infusions are to be mixed. The whole is to
 be heated for an instant, and then allowed to subside for twenty-
 four hours, when it is to be filtered again : gum and sugar are
 then to be added ; and when they are dissolved, the whole is to
 be once more passed through the sieve.                The ink is then to be
 mixed with the     oxide     or  red   sulphate, but neither the acidu
 lated nor oxidulated sulphate ought to be used. The whole being
 then shaken, may be put into a stone bottle and corked with a
 paper stopper.
     Not only is the ink thus prevented from being corrupted, but
 it loses another bad property, namely, that of thickening.                The
 aeid of the vinegar    is  combined     as  a  mucous   kind  of acetate  with
 the mucilaginous matter, and precipitates it ; the vinegar is very
 much softened in this infusion by the connexion which its acid
 parts form with the mucus.           The thickening of the ink arises
 f-f>m the sulphuric acid rendered free, precipitating              this body.
 The mucus of the gum arabic scarcely undergoes this change at
 all. I consider myself fortunate in having so well succeeded
 in this preparation.
     I lately made a very singular experiment. I was directing on
 some red oxide of mercury scarcely heated to 30° of Reaumur, a
 jet of hydrogen gas from a bladder.               I wished to obtain water,
 but did not obtain any, but the red oxide became white. f
 heated it more fiercely, and it was red hot before the steam of
 the water appeared ; and then instead of reduced mercury there
 remained black oxidulate, which I had much difficulty in de
 oxidating.    I forgot to say, that during the process the matter
instead of becoming of a dull purple colour became yeliow only.
     Having repeated the experiment at a low red heat, I obtained
 water and concrete reduced mercury which resisted the fire a long
 time, giving out hydrogen and liquid metal.                I operated with a
 double crucible,   the    upper one being of glass.          My first idea of
 this phaenomenon was incorrect; for I had, like Dobereiner and
 Davy, made of the mercury a new metal concrete even in the
 fire, by incorporating an overplus of hydrogen at first with its
 oxide, and afterwards with the reduced metal.
     Hence came a metal more intense, and which will not be more
 deoxidable in the fire, if it does not remain decomposable in the
 hydrogen added.         We may regard this super-hydrogenation,
 when it takes place upon the oxide, as a mineral organization,
 and the same with that which carbon undergoes in plants, and
                                                                          azote

aaote   in air and animals.    The irreducible silver which Richter
procured from an alchemist was silver organized by water, and
thus become a new metal, more intense on account of its oxida
tion by water instead of oxygen, and without depositing or se
parating hydrogen.       Tellurium and arsenic are organized by
water, and converted either into new oxides of metals, or into
kinds of acidifiable combustibles, in those hydrogenated bodies
and in the tellurated and arsenicated hydrogens.          I ought to
have reflected that in the fust experiment I had only obtained
mercury, oxvgen and water: this fust experiment was so far
particular, that in order to be reduced the mercury became sub^
oxidated, which in common cases does not take place ; but it is
true that the second oxygen was here taken up by the hydrogen,
The new metal does not appear susceptible of any but one de
gree of oxidation.
    You must doubtless have perceived that the double acidifiable
 combustible which with hydrogen forms prussic acid, and which
scientifically ought to be called Prussium, (hence prussiated hy
drogen gas, prussiate, prussure, &c.) is with respect to azote
 what the alcohol of Lampadius (and which we might also with
out much impropriety call lampadium,         and hence larnpadiated
hydrogen gas, lampadotes, lampadures, &c. not to say sulphuret
 and azoturet of carbon, which would be false,) is with respect to
sulphur.     The two compounds have the same physical and che-r
 mical properties : they are very gasifiable, colourless, and dia*
 phanous; dry oxygen cannot resolve them into the acids of
 their elements, and without water we could not decompose them.
We see, in short, that one of the combustibles acts with respect
 to the other, in the room of water ; so that this last is not only
 reduced, but subtracted in the portion of hydrogen which
 composes its oxygen into water.       If therefore one of the com
 pounds is the alcohol of sulphur, the other is alcohol of azote;
 and in both, in their solution by hydrogen, the carbon goes for
 the first proportion of this principle; and the one ought already
to bfe considered as hydrogenated sulphur, and the other as
 azote hydrogenated, but by carbon instead of hydrogen.
    You must know that iodine receives reduced mf-tals in ex?
 change for its oxygen, and forms, like the dry fluoilc and mu
 riatic acids, combustibles salifiable by oxygenation ; for instance,
 by the oxidation of their metals.      The hydrogen dots not dis
 place  the  metal  from them,   but composes the metallo-iode into
 iodure of reduced metal, by producing actually acidifiable com
 bustible from the iodic acid.
    The oxygenated iodine which Sir Humphry Davy obtained by
 treating iodine with oxygenated chlorine, is not eu-iodine, but

only oxygenated chlorine, the euchlorine being hyperoxygenated
chlorine.     The dry acid in this compound              at all times free

oxidation.
 I    am informed that Sir Humphry Davy has undertaken a la
borious inquirv into the de-hydrogenation of the fluoric acid into
fluorine, availing himself of iodine with this view.              shall ven

reduced metals, or upon the metallo-fluors, that all attempts
must be made to dehydrogenate this acid. But according to my
first results, there are formed flumes very much hypercomposed
of metal, and from which the fluor does not appear separable.

 it for an oxide, in the ordinary acids, which on that account         I
 have named fluate, muriate, sulphate, &c. of kydrose, not to say
 of water.
    1 have made several additional experiments of late, which have
 confirmed   my opinion, that the ashes of the metals are acids or
oxidules more or less combined with reduced metal, which makes
 it necessary for the acids to be heated, in order to dissolve them,
 or in order that the oxidated part may        be separated from the
reduced part, and that they should share       it in those two parts in
 the solution, which without caloric could      not take place if the
oxide be not already in existence.         The combinations between
the oxidules and the oxides, and between the latter and the hjt-
peroxides, form the degrees called intermediate of oxidation, and
which intermediate degrees some authors have not yet ceased
to admit.     I call hyper-oxide every oxide which ought to de
posit oxygen, in order to be capable of being dissolved in the
acids, and which consequently gives chlorine with muriatic acid.
 Several of the organic substances are combinations between
oxides and oxidules ; and as the affinity is weak, both the one
and the other is easily engaged in excess ; and when we analyse
these substances, we frequently do nothing more than combine
them with the reagents; and then, instead of educti, we have
products which we mistake for new principles.            The fine ana
lysis of the oxalates  by  fire  has proved,  what  1 always said, that
the vegetable acids have for their common fixed base earbonous
acid, and for a varying principle water.     This analysis has yielded
out of the oxalates with weak metals, carbonic acid and metal
reduced after having allowed the escape of water.           There are
earbonites therefore.     The same salts with stronger oxides have
yielded water, and the earbonites remaining have been resolved
into gaseous oxide of carbon; and the oxalates with very strong
metals are decomposed, after the manner of the acids alone,
into water, acetous acid, carbonic acid, oil, carbonated hydrogen
gas, with hydrogen and carbon as the residue.
    Not only is the residue of the sulphuric ether an acidinulated
sulphate of ether, but alio, what is singular- for an acid which
changes its own water with the oxides, and forms dry salts, that
of the ether bv the fluoric acid is an acidinulated fluate of ether,
which in these salts exists in the state of gas, and the excess of
acid is therein hydrated.       From the new alcohol, neutral com
pounds are made, which the fire once more resolves into insulated
ethers, and into acidinulated salts.      These salts are not deeom-

posed by the alkalies ; but, by saturating the excess of acid, they
so act that the sulphate or fluate of ether, become neuter, rrtay
still be divider] into isolated ether and acidinulated salt. The
stronger acids assume with the oxides of any of these neutral
or acidinulated salts the place of weaker acid-.              Ether is not
separable     from   the  acidinulated    salts,   but by its destruction.
Boulay     has confirmed that      the ethers are subhydrated alcohol ;
I   say confirmed, because I said so a long time ago.            The car
bon and hydrogen are there in the same absolute ratio, but less
organized by water.         It is not astonishing that an oxide'so en
 ergetic   as  the  ethereous    gas contracts with the acids equally
 strong engagements.         In  short,   when we say " there is in che
 mistry nothing but hydrogen, metals, oxvgen, combustibles and
 acidifiable comburans, oxides, acids, and salts," we have em-
 b*accd the whole science, simplified the course of things, and
 placed as it were an astronomical station.

                       EARTHQUAKE        IN SCOTLAND.
     About eleven o'clock on the night of the 13th of August a
 tremendous shock of an earthquake was felt in various parts of
 the north of Scotland.        At Aberdeen, Perth, Montrose, and In
 verness, its effects were most remarkable; but although many
 houses in all these places were shaken from their/ foundations
 and partially shattered, we are happy to add, that from the du
 rable and massy architecture of the houses in Scotland, no hu
 man lives were lost.      Several bridges in the district thus visited
 also suffered severely, but the most singular phenomenon               at
 tending the awful concussion is the effect which it produced on
 the spire at Inverness.       A letter from this place thus describes
 part of the devastation there in the following terms:
      " Chimney-tops were thrown down or damaged in every quar
  ter of the town. The Mason Lodge, occupied as an hotel, was rent
 from top to bottom, the north a stalk of the chimney partly thrown
  down ; one of the coping-stones, weighing, I should think, from
 fifty to sixty pounds, was thrown to the other side of the streetj
  a distance not less than sixty feet.           The spire of the steeple,
  which I think one of the handsomest in Scotland, has been se
  riously injured, and must in part be taken down.             The spire is
  an octagon ; and within five or six feet oj the top, the angles
  of the octagon are turned nearly to the middle of l he fiat
  sides of the octagon immediately tmder it.           What is more won
  derful  than   any thing attending the memorable event, notwith
   standing the vast quantities of stones and bricks that have been
  thrown from such immense heights, not one person has received
  any hurt !"

   Our chemical and mineralogical readers will be glad to hear,
that by means  of a blow-pipe for burning the gaseous constituents
of water, in a state of high condensation, and which is con
structed by Mr." Newman, of Lisle-street, Leicester-square,      a
degree of heat may be produced greater than that of the most
powerful Galvanic battery.      Professor Clarke, of Cambri'dge,
who is engaged in a series of analytical experiments with the
blow-pipe, has already succeeded in the decomposition of tlie
earths ; having obtained metals from barytes and strontian,
which do not become oxided by exposure to atmospheric air.
The metal of barytes is ductile, and has the lustre of silver. An
account of these experiments will be shortly before the public.
  A correspondent in Sussex has remarked the very rapid and
great evaporation from the earth's surface during the clear in
tervals of the late showery weather, — a circumstance which may
account   in   some measure         for the continuance   of   so much rain.
                      STEAM ENGINES IN CORNWALL.
   By Messrs. Leans' Report for July, the average work of twenty-
seven  engines was 2.0,142,363 pounds lifted one foot high with
 each bushel of coals consumed.
   During the same month the work performed by Woolf's en
gine at Wheal Vor was 47,610,798 pounds lilted one foot high
with each bushel.      His engine at Wheal Abraham that is in full
work, lifted during the same month 51,923,679 pounds one foot
with each bushel.      His other engine at the same mine, not vet
at her full load, lifted 23,794,469 pounds to the same height
with every bushel of coals.
   The last mentioned engine has a 60-inch cylinder, but is only
loaded 2 lib. 9 per square inch ; while his other engine at the
same mine (with a 45-i'nch cylinder) has a load of 15 lib. 1 per
square inch ; that        is,

               MAJOR PEDDIE's EXPEDITION              TO AFRICA.
  The spring      transport         which  carried Major Peddie and his
companion   Capt. Campbell to              Africa, arrived after  tedious
                                                                    a

at Senegal   ;and the troops which were to have arrived from
Sierra Leone      December not joining till the 25th of February,
                 in
unavoidably delayed the department of the expedition from the
coast till too late for the season. This delay will, however, be
                                                                     attended         >

     attended with advantages, as it will enable Capt. Campbell, who
  - will make the necessary astronomical observations, to settle the.
     position of many places on the coast of Africa with more pre
     cision than has hitherto been done.           He had in the month of
     February    last  made  a great  number   of observations    of distances
     of the sun and moon, and moon and stars, from which he found
     the longitude of Senegal different from what is given in the
     tables ; the latitude Capt. Campbell fixes from his observations
     at 16° 2' 30" N.        He was, however, anxious to avail himself
     of a greater number of observations before he finally fixed the
     longitude of the town ; which as soon as he has done, he pro
     mises to transmit for the use of navigators.        The expedition has
    been fitted out with several good sextants, principally of Mr.
     Carey's make, and two of them contain a contrivance for taking
    single altitudes by means of a level contrived by the late Lieut. -
i   gen. Brown, under whose management the astronomical part of
    the expedition was fitted out.       Besides sextants, Capt. Campbell
     has barometers (principally Mr. Arnold's), and a small transit
    instrument     ;  but the latter is so badly made, that the captain
    says,   in  a letter to his friend in  England, he cannot make any
    use of it.     As this expedition was planned rather late in the
    spring of last year, and great fear was entertained of losing the
    season, the astronomical apparatus was as well as many other
    parts hurried.       Mr. Troughton would no doubt have been em
    ployed;    but    the shortness of the time, and the engagements of
    this excellent artist, deprived the expedition of the benefit of his
    superior instruments ; and although this circumstance has occa
    sioned some regret to the astronomer employed, he has however
    great satisfaction in believing, with the exception of the transit*,
    all the other instruments are very well executed.            It was per
    haps impossible forGovernment to have selected two gentlemen
    better qualified to undertake this arduous enterprise; and from,
    the care which has been taken in the equipment, the public may
    look forward with great probability to the full accomplishment of
    the object of the expedition.
                  RECIPES FOR MAKING JAPAN OR VARNISH.
        The following recipes for making japan or varnish are given
    in   a contemporary journal, as having been recently imported
    from Germany.         These compositions are described as rendering
    all articles to which they are applied impervious to wet without
    destroying elasticity.

stands all the chemical agents that blacken other white pigments
used in japanning.       It is obtained in the following manner :
     Let some artificial carbonate of barytes (obtained by decom
posing or pouring into a solution of native carbonate of barytes
a saturated solution of subcarbonate of ammonia) be ground up
with a sufficient quantity of white oil varnish, and apply it suc
cessively upon the leather.       This being done, the finishing coats
are given    to the article with a japan composed of carbonate of
barytes ground up with white copal varnish ; and when perfectly
dry, the leather is polished with a piece of felt and finely levi
gated pumice-stone powder, and the last or finishing polish is
 applied by means of a sponge or soft brush and burnt hartshorn
 powder.
     Yellow Japan. — To obtain a clear transparent yellow, the
 leather must of course be white, and a yellow dye is given to it
 by means of woad or French berries and alum ; and when per
 fectly dry the japan ground of patent yellow is applied in the
 manner     above stated.
      Red Japan. — For this purpose the base of the japan ground
 must be made up with madder lake ground up with oil of turpen
 tine ; this forms the first ground.     When perfectly dry, a second
  coat must be applied, composed of lake and white copal varnish;
  and the last, with a coat composed of a mixture of copal and
 turpentine varnish ground up with lake.
      Blue Japan. — The first coat must be given with artificial car
  bonate of barytes ground up with oil varnish ; the second with
  Prussian blue, ground in copal varnish and finished as before
  stated.
      Black Japan is obtained by applying finely levigated ivory
  black ground up with linseed oil varnish ; the second coat must
  consist of the same pigment ground up in copal varnish.
                EDINBURGH      DISSKCTION OF THE BRAIN.
      A considerable interest having been excited in Edinburgh for
  some time past, about the discoveries of Gall and Spurzheim,
  relative to the structure and functions of the brain, Dr. Spurz
  heim at length made a dissection of that organ in one of the
  anatomical dissecting rooms of the University.        Besides the re
  gular students m.iny of the professors were present, as well as
  other scientific persons interested in these new and important
   discoveries.   Dr. S. succeeded in making the most perfect dissec
   tion of the brain, and received the approbation of those who
   were present.     Many persons who had previously opposed the
   new method of dissecting this organ, testified to the superi
   ority of Dr. Spurzheim's new mode of developing the hitherto
   unexplored structure of the brain and nervous system.

 H4                   The Nautical Indicator.
                   NEW NAUTICAL      INSTRUMENT.
                           To  Mr. Tillock.
   Sir, — In  order that the instrument offered to your notice may
become as useful to mariners and travellers as the problem orr
which it is grounded was to the inventor and his shipmates in the
years 1813 and 1S14, he respectfully solicits the publication of
this in your very useful Magazine.
   The instrument alluded to is called a Nautical Indicator, and
is a representation of the circles and arches of the natural hemi
sphere, as far as they are necessary to the seaman and traveller,
and when set to observe altitudes of the sun, or of a star, at any
time of the dav or night, gives a distinct view of the meridian
altitude ; zenith distance ; azimuth ; amplitude ; true time ;
length of the day, and variation of t!ie needle at the place of
observation, without the possibility of (umvilful) error ; by placing
the whole under the eye of the observer in their natural positions.
   To a traveller by land, no other accompanying instrument
than a spirit level is necessary, to ascertain all the abovemen-
tioned articles.   At a time when perhaps the mind is too much
agitated  for numerical  calculation, it will in two or three minutes
remove every uncertainty with respect to place ajt one observa
tion.
    To the curious in his study, it will readilysolve many important
problems in both geography and astronomy as well as naviga
tion, among which the progressive variation of the magnetic
needle is not the least.
   To the teacher in his school, this instrument will be of much
benefit, in detecting the errors of his pupils, and giving them a
clear demonstration — that, with the observed altitudes, the in
terval of time between each, and the known declination at that
time, the sun is precisely at the same distance from the meri
dian, and that the meridian altitude can be no other than that
given by the instrument, as also all the forementioned objects
indispensably necessary to navigators.
   To merchants this invention must be of the utmost conse
quence, since by death, sickness, or casualties, the charge of
their ships and cargoes often devolves on those whose knowledge,
through want of proper education, is far from being adequate to
the trust. — The instrument is of tl>e most simple construction,
and the application may be understood by almost any capacity
in a few hours — by a mariner at first sight.
   Any gentleman willing to patronize this invention, will please
to address to James Hunter, No. 9, Leicester-street, Leicester-
square, London; or at Mr. John Thin's, architect and builder,

 Sportsmen," by P. Hawker, Esq. we find the following recipes
'for treating the diseases and accidents to which these useful ani

 making public the means which he prescribes.

 sometimes incurable disease would require a volume; but, of all
  that I have yet tried, none lias answered better than the one I

   putting     about      half   an ounce   of either to a pint of water.
       " The following is a recipe, which no bribe could tempt the
   vender to part with ;' but, by means of some very clever chemist3r
   1 have ascertained it to be simply as follows ; after some trouble
   in   discovering the proportions, and discarding                 the ingredients
   by   means of which it was disguised in a pill.

    the  lotion,      if required for the nostrils, should      be observed here,
    as  before mentioned.
       " Notwithstanding             the trouble we had to discover this simple
    recipe,     I should prefer the        one first given, because there is less

One, from which it must appear that in the original arrange
ment of the materials of our world, the speculations of theorists,
and more particularly of the Neptunians,         received no support
from the present order of things and the disposition of our strata
as we now find them, upon the principles          they lay down, and
under the suppositions these wise philosophers make.
    Hence they are reduced to the necessity of assuming various
changes to have taken place, of which we have no record, nor
even tradition ; and of introducing      agents, for whose existence
we have no authority, but the ipse dixit. of these gentlemen.
    Thus they, as well as other theorists, are used to get oyer all
difficulties embarrassing their favourite theories, by calling in the
 aid of revolutions and convulsions, which, as they say, have de^
 ranged and disturbed every thing : but an attentive examinar
 tion of any of our little systems, upon which I dwelled in my
last, will soon show that    it, at least, has never been revolu
 tionized, and but very slightly disturbed       faint, yet steady and
                                                     ;   a
uniform change, in the inclination of all the component strata,
probably at first horizontal, now slightly inclined.
    The local circumstances of each separate stratum, and its
junction with those contiguous to              it,
                                            without any interruption
of the continuity or solidity of the heterogeneous materials, show
plainly that they have not been acted on                     by
                                                    any violent .cause,
since their consolidation.
    From the local circumstances of our precipitous northern
 coast,I   once showed in controversy, that these powerful instru
 ments, revolutions and convulsions, so necessary to theorists, had
 never been in action in my country: — in reply, by way of com

  be happy to show when they venture to state them ; and that
  our strata, as we find them, could not have been formed by che
  mical precipitation, or mechanical deposition, from the waters of
  the chaotic fluid, as Mr. Kirwan supposes. This respectable
  countryman of ours, who hazards himself further than any other
*
  Neptunian I know, supposes the chaotic fluid to have been a
  mighty menstruum, from which our strata have been precipitated.
  That this menstruum, holding all the materials of the world in
  solution, must have been very powerful at first, but gradually
  abating in energy, as its materials were precipitated : — hence
  we should expect to find a perpetual gradation in the materials
  of our strata, the upper parts differing from the lower, in each
   separate stratum.
      Nothing like nature ; for we find the most decided uniformity
   take place in all parts of the same stratum.
      Mr. Kirwan's theory is still more irreconcileable to the for
   mation of a mass, or accumulation of strata, always passing into
   each other per saltum; and utterly incompatible with the for
   mation of alternate strata, a most common arrangement.
      Admitting the chaotic fluid to have been the grand matrix of
   our strata, and that agents we know not had altered the preci
   pitating powers of the same fluid ; the order of succession in the
   strata would have been still the same ; and having the material
   of one stratum, we could tell that of the next it rested upon,
   and so on.
      Thus mining, where the material we seek for is disposed in
   strata, (as coal,) would be the simplest science we have r — on the
   contrary, we have not ascertained any regular order in our strata
   in a vertical direction ; and instead of pointing our efforts to ac
   cumulate facts from different and distant places, we recur to
   theory, assume modes of original formation, and thence deduce
   rules to which Nature shows she is not subjected, even that of
   specific gravities, giving us not the least assistance.
      I know that those conversant with the subject, state certain
   indications, from which they infer the proximity of coal strata;
   but from our total ignorance of original formation, we have no
   clue to the order of arrangement, and cannot pronounce posi
   tively in any case, that we have coal strata beneath us,
      There seems to be a broad belt in our northern hemisphere,
   through many parts of which coal strata are found at various
   depths; but the difficulty of determining where we may expect
   them is very great ; I fear insurmountable, if we look for cer
   tainty.
      Coal, ever since Marco Polo told us the Chinese burned black
   stones, appears to be an article of the greatest importance, and
   in some manufactures of prime necessity. Indeed the time seems
                                                                     to

to be   approaching when this valuable species of fuel will be con
sidered as such in many parts       of the north of Ireland : hence
 great proprietors,   and among the rest my friend the Earl of
 Gosford, are anxiously inquiring into the probability of fmding
 coal on their estates.
    We have mountebanks under many forms, and I know none
more ignorant, or more likely to mislead, than those who claim
 to be coal-finders.
    I shall take the liberty of recommending to those proprietors
who are anxious to find coal on their estates, to consider the sub-?
ject as a question of fact, not of theory and speculation ; and
 to act accordingly.
    That    is,
              to m^ke the experiment at the least possible expense,
to find how boring can be executed in the cheapest           manner    ;
 and then to try in as many different places as may be found con
venient, not under the direction of persons who claim to be
adepts  ;  but of plain honest men, who, without speculating on
the subject, will report facts as they find them           these may
                                                              :
be transmitted for opinion to those most experienced in such
 researches, and   I  know not any one who has taken so much
 pains to make himself master of the subject, as my able friend
G.   B. Greenough, Esq. late President of the Geological Society.
    Some do not use such violent agents, but quietly elevate our
 mountains and high islands, in the direction of an axis perpen
 dicular to the horizon ;   leaving to others to investigate the pro
truding cause.
    The Neptunians wrap their mantle-formed strata about small
elevations,   until they accumulate them into mountains.
    Whoever discusses questions with theorists, should be very cau
tious as to the terms he permits them to adopt in stating their
opinions: they are fond of using the words may and might; they
should be told that in argument these should be changed into
did and must.       The terms possible and impossible must also be
erased from the vocabulary of theorists       from the former no

                                              is
for such novices in the art of world-making to hazard. — They
should be limited to facts; and, in their deductions, subjected to
 the rigid rules of logic.

ball, watched for     an opportunity  of tripping up those who    ven-,
 tured themselves boldly.
    I have not always been so cautious ; for although I gave up
all hopes of explaining the earlier processes of nature, in the
formation and arrangement of the materials of our globe, I have
inquired carefully into the operations that have been performed
upon it since its consolidation, and particularly into the forma
 tion of its present surface, so curiously diversified.
    My sentiments on this subject have been held still more wild than-
the theories of those whom I- have taken the liberty to laugh at.
    i have sustained that the surface of our original world was
 once elevated above the tops of our highest mountains.          That
some mighty agent had acted upon our then surface, (probably
uniform,) and had carried off its materials, irregularly and in
immense quantities, reducing the globe to a smaller size with-
its present surface, without disturbing the materials left behind.
    According to this position, the question of the formation of
our mountains vanishes ; they are no longer the stupendous mo
numents of powerful agents, or the results of grand operations
 of Nature, but merelv the scattered remnants of a diminished
world.
    All this, your ladyship will say, is much wilder than any of the
theories I have been ridiculing; but I must request you to distin
guish: all these are mere matters of opinion ; while my positions-
are given as matters of fact. The philosophers I allude to, claim
to be acquainted with their agents, and show how they might have
acted.     1 admit I know nothing of mine, but that he did act; —
the results, that is the natural appearances, or facts, these gentle
men bring forward, or decline to notice, are at variance with,
and irreconcileable to their respective theories.        The facts to
which I call attention, and in general the face of nature, when
ever laid bare to us, afford as clear demonstration of the truth
 of my positions, as any theorem in Euclid is capable of receiving.
    The question of original formation has been long abundantly
discussed.      Let us take new ground, and try to develope from
existing facts the operations that have been performed on our
globe since its final consolidation: — appearances which will'
justify the position, that our world did not come thus as it now
stands from the hand of Nature ; — that important changes must
have taken place — that mighty agents, unknown to us only by
 the marks they have left behind them, must have acted upon it.
    I shall slightly mention a few of the appearances that seem to,
 countenance these wild suppositions :
    I. The irregular diversification of our surface, quite uncon
 nected with original formation, and the arrangement of our
strata.
                                                               2. The

                  On   the  Excitement of Voltaic Plates.               165
   '%.   The isolated and highly elevated stratified hummocks, found
in many countries, and especially in basaltic districts.
    3. - Whyn dykes, very lately brought into notice, but now burst
ing upon us in different parts of the world, in the form of walls
 of terrific altitude, and most regular construction.
    4. Caverns, so abundant, especially on tfie confines of sea and
land, and in calcareous districts, grand and beautiful grottoes,
bearing irresistible marks of posterior excavation, not to be ex
ecuted by any agents with which we are acquainted.
    5. The line of demarcation between sea and land, and the for
mation of the basin of the ocean.
    It has pleased Nature to lay bare the northern district of
 Antrim, and I may say its whole coast, to disclose her secrets to
us, and to expose her arrangements to the naked eye; it is rn
our magnificent facades, so numerous, and so kindly extended
along a great line of coast, that we are enabled to distinguish
between original formation and posterior operations ; and to
pronounce upon the quiet state in which these original materials
have remained since their final consolidation ; notwithstanding
the numerous revolutions and convulsions so confidently ob
truded on us.
     I shall in my next request your ladyship to accompany me
to a new field, where the original arrangements of Nature seem
to be the same with those in Antrim, and where posterior opera
tions also bear a strong resemblance, and of course where my
arguments drawn from facts receive further confirmation ; I
mean the island of St. Helena, upon which the attention of the
world has been lately much fixed from causes unconnected with
its natural history.
            I am, with much respect,
                   Your ladyship's most obedient humble servant,

Indies, and until the latter end of last March, not having had
an opportunity of obtaining the subsequent numbers of his Jour
nal, I was unconscious that what I had written had particularly
interested Mr. De Luc.
    I have carefully perused the papers which have been published
by him subsequently to my quitting Europe, and have renewed
my acquaintance with those which had been previously given to
the world.      In doing so, I have derived no small degree of plea
 sure, and much interesting and important information : but as
 I suppose the several points of excellence, with whatever defects
they may be blended, will be sufficiently obvious to the scientific
reader, I have confined the following remarks exclusively to
 those parts of his writings which have been urged against the
doctrines contained in my papers ; and I have endeavoured to
observe such an order as will put the several points of difference
between us in the strongest light.        Had I remained in England,
the particular t rain of thought into which I had casually fallen,
 would probably have, led me to further speculations on the sub
ject of electricity; but situate as I am, in an atmosphere ex
 tremely unfavourable for electrical experiments, without the
 means of obtaining philosophical instruments, except after the
  lapse of several months, from Europe, and with access to very
 few philosophical books out of my own circumscribed collection;
 I have no new matter with which to enrich your pages, and it
 is with much diffidence I presume to occupy the time of your
 readers.
     Mr. De Luc considers that he had published nearly twelve
 months previously to the appearance of my Essay on Chemical
 Affinity*, a refutation of Sir Humphry Davy's hypothesis relative
 to the principles of chemical affinity, and the decompositions
 produced by Galvanism.         It will be remembered that this hypo
 thesis supposed that the elements of all compounds naturally
 possess different electrical stales or energies, the one component
 particle being positive, the other negative; that this difference of
 electrical state is the immediate cause of chemical union ; but
 that, when the compound is subjected to a Galvanic battery in a
 sufficient state of excitation, the particles possessing the negative
 energy are attracted by the positively, and repelled by the nega-
 lively electrified wire; and the particles possessing the positive
 energy are attracted by the negatively electrified, and repelled
by the positively electrified wire ; and that the force of these at
 tractions and repulsions of the Galvanic wires to the component
 particles of a compound body, when greater than the attraction
 between the component particles arising from the difference of
                       * Phil. Journal, vol. xsix.
                                                                 their

 their electrical      energies, is sufficient to subvert the combina
tion*.
     The experiments to which Mr. De Luc alludes, as particularly
affording a refutation of this hypothesis, are the third and tenth,
contained in the first part of his analysis of the Galvanic pilef,
and to this paper I beg to refer your readers.                   Now, sir, 1 do
not think that the result of these experiments invalidates in the
slightest degree the hypothesis in question ; as a knowledge of
the general principle in electricity, which has been termed in*
duction or the law of induction, will enable us to reconcile the
apparent disagreement.             Upon this principle I will contend that
the electrical states of the points 1.2.3.4. were not such as
Mr. De Luc supposes, but that 1. and 3. must, under every va
riety of the experiment, have been positive ; 2. and 4. negative.
1 am aw.are that the application              of this law to the particular
case in question has been objected to.                Mr. Singer considers it
impossible for this law to operate, " unless the bodies be sepa
rated by a non-conductor, the resistance of which is sufficient to
prevent the passage of electricity from one to the other J," and
therefore, that it is altogether inapplicable to the phenomena of
the" interrupted circuit;" the objection to its application being,
that water is a conductor and incapable of affording such resist
ance.       The experiments of Mr. De Luc§, however, very plainly
 demonstrate that there is such resistance in water as occasions a
 retardation and residua of electricity; in other words, such a
 resistance as prevents a free passage of electricity.                That the
situation of bodies being such as to enable electricity to pass
from one to the other does not prevent the operation of this law,
is fully established by the early experiments on the subject
                                                                                || ;
and I will contend that it is as fairly applicable to the inter
rupted circuit in Mr. De Luc's experiments, as to any phaeno-
mena of electricity: consequently I do not conceive that the
reasonings of Mr. De Luc, founded on the result of his third and
tenth experiments, are admissible; and I am inclined to consider
the arguments contained in my Essay, the first valid objections
opposed to Sir II. Davy's opinions on the subject of chemical
affinity and decomposition ; and, in fact, the first if not the only
 refutation of them.
     Having stated the results of my experiments with the Voltaic
 plates, I observed that they are subversive of the most com
 monly received opinion of the manner in which a Voltaic pile is
 excited, which originated in the phenomena of these plates, and
  " rests on the
                      assumption that dissimilar metals while in con,-

tact are in different electrical states ;" — in other words, that a
difference of electrical state is produced by the contact of these
plates.    That the Voltaic plates indicate no degree of excite
ment whatever while in contact, but that excitement becomes
evident after their separation, is not a supposition, but a fact
demonstrated by the irresistible evidence of our senses ; as much
a demonstrated fact, as that all bodies of whatsoever nature fall
through a given space in vacuo in the same time — the one alto
gether as unconnected with any particular hypothesis concerning
the remote cause of electrical phenomena, as the other is un
connected with any speculations relative to the remote cause of
gravitation. But Mr. De Luc has promised to show the converse
of my statement; — " to demonstrate by a great number of experi
ments, that these effects [the excitement of the Foltaic plates)
exist only during the contact, and that it is owing to extraneous
circumstances that any effect remains after their separation*."
 1 have naturally looked with much eagerness           for this promised
 demonstration ; but I have not been able to find one single ex
periment which militates in the slightest degree against my
statement relative to the Voltaic platen, and which indeed, as it
is a bare expression of facts, I do believe, will for ever remain
incontrovertible.     It however appears, that Mr. De Luc's pro
mise to demonstrate the inaccuracy of my statement, has ori
ginated in his having unaccountably mistaken it ; for he repre
sents mc as having asserted that excitement of the pile cannot
be produced while the metals are in contact : whereas every one
who has the slightest knowledge of the science of electricity, is
aware that, in the more ordinary combinations for the pile, two
metals have always been in contact; and that, in the kind of
trough which was until lately used, two metals are soldered to
gether.     I am sorry that my observations should have been so
 misunderstood; as it has occasioned Mr. De Luc much pains to
 refute an opinion, which I could never have advanced in open
 defiance to common experience, and has induced him to sup
 pose that I am unacquainted, not only with his experiments,
 and the very ordinary phenomena of the pile, but with the
 earliest and simplest fact? relative to the science on which I had
 written.    In truth, sir, his experiments with the pile have no
 reference whatever to mine with the plates.          Let it be granted,
 that excitement took place in every dissection of the pile, in the
 manner and degree he describes, I yet affirm that there is no
 analogy between the circumstances necessary for the excitement

quire a difference  of electrical state by contact, is not only un
supported,   but actually subverted by the phenomena of the Vol
taic PLATES.
    In another instance, Mr. De Luc misapprehends in a most ex
traordinary manner the tenor of my observations.
                                                           " I filled,"
said 1,   "  one of the new porcelain troughs with an acid fluid, so
that the metallic plates and their connecting arcs were com
pletely covered.      In this state a trough of ten pairs of plates
three inches square decomposed water rapidly" — " I placed the
metals connected by the bar in a trough without partitions, and
no action ensued*."        The result of this experiment was to me
anomalous and unexpected.          But Mr. De Luc has endeavoured
to explain   it,   bytaking as data, that " when the plates were im
mersed up to the bar in liquid," " the effect was reduced to that
of one single pairf;" or, as      I   suppose, no perceptible action
ensued.       By a reference however to the experiment, he will find
that such was the state of the apparatus when           itdecomposed
water rapidly.       He has therefore misunderstood the statement
of the fact, but in no degree explained     it J.
 I     indeed regret that Mr. De Luc has misunderstood any thing
that
   I      have written; butI    am altogether distressed at his ques
tioning the accuracy of my experiments with the Voltaic plates;
cot indeed in consequence of having founded, as he supposes,           a
" Galvanic system" on them, which am not aware of having
                                           I
attempted, but because   I     value, above all other qualifications of
an author, impartiality and fidelity in narration.        Mr. De Luc
thinks some extraneous cause must have operated in my experi
ments, otherwise one single contact and separation of my plates
could never have produced a sensible divergence of the gold-
leaves:    hut he does not hint at any extraneous cause in particu
 lar,  which   he conceived likely to be the one — and as the ap
                                                    ;
 paratus employed and the manner of performing the experi
 ments were minutely described at the time the results were given,
  any extraneous cause attached either to the one or the other
  might easily have been detected and exposed.            Mr. De Luc
  states that in M. Haiiy's experiments     it   required ten contacts
 and separations of plates the size of mine before the gold-leaves
  were sensibly affected.    In the repetition which he made of these
  experiments with smaller plates,    it   required twenty repetitions
  before the effect on the gold-leaves was visible.        Now, sir,   I
  have expressed    in  my Essay, and so   I   wish to be understood,
  that

 I I   should like to know whether the result of the experiment, as stated

 but a vc»y considerable divergence of the gold-leaves.                   What
 must be the impression         on the   mind    of  your   readers  from   this
 discordance of statement ?             Either that Mr. De Luc's and
  M. Haiiy's experiments were very coarsely performed, or that I
 have grossly exaggerated the result of mine. Of the accuracy of
 my own experiments I cannot doubt, and it is in the power of
 anv gentleman at a trifling expense to repeat them, and decide
 for himself.     But, sir, you must be aware that I am not the only
 person who has obtained such results.              I can at this time par
 ticularly refer to M. Volta for support.           A description of his ap
  paratus, manner of experimenting, and the result of his experi
  ments, are contained in the following quotation : " Ces plaques
 out trois pouces de diametre: les metaux doivent etre tres-polis,
 bien depouilles d'humidite, et appliques l'un sur l'autre de ma-
 ltiere k manifester tme cohesion sensible.             L'un d'eux doit etse

 parer d'un seul trait et perpendiculairement : on fait toucher
 atiusi celui qui a et(5 d&ache' au chapeau d'un eleetrometre, et
 on doit quelquefois un e"cartement des fils*."                 Volta's plates
 were three inches in diameter, mine five ; and as the areas of
  circles to each other are as the squares of their diameters, it will
 be seen that my plates were nearly three times as large as M.
 Volta's: hence one sufficient reason why the results in my ex
 periments were so much more evident than in his ;                     another
 reason is however to be found in the extreme delicacy of my
 electrometer f.       But how comes it that in Mr. De Luc's experi
 ments    it  required twenty contacts and separations to produce
 the effect obtained by M. Volta by one contact and separation,
 although the plates of these philosophers seem to have been very
 nearly of the same size ? But, what is more extraordinary, how
 comes it that ten contacts and separations of M. Haiiy's plates,
 nearly three times as large as M. Volta's, were required to pro-

    + This electrometer consists of a glass tube about 4$ inches long, its in
 ternal diameter a little more than an inch, capped with metal at each ex
tremity.    By one cap it is fixed to its pedestal ; in the other cap there is a
hole through which a small ulass tube, an inch and half long, passes, and is
fastened so that one half is within the body of the electrometer, the other
without.     The external and internal surface of this tube is coated with in
sulating varnish, and through the tube passes a wire, to one end of which
may be adapted plates of any size: to the other is fixed a small pair of
forceps which receive the gold-leaves. These are 1J inch long and very
narrow; their extremities are a full inch from the pedestal, and a little more
than half an inch from the tinfoil. — Now the circumstance which, indepen
dent of the size of the instrument, contributes to make it more delicate
than electrometers of this kind generally are, is the gold-leaves being con
nected with nothing but the wire — not with the cap, as is generally the
case.
                                                                          duce

duce an effect equal to one contact and separation of M. Volta's
plates, and an effect very far inferior to one contact and separa
tion of my plates, to which they exactly correspond in size ?
Some extraneous cause must,                  indeed, have operated in the ex
periments of M. Haiiy and of Mr. De Luc. Probably their elec
trometers were not very delicate ; possibly they did not pay due
regard to those circumstances on which depends the full action of
the   plates.
    In reference to the production of Galvanism, I also observed
that the Galvanic apparatus can only be excited by a decom
posable fluid.    This 1 meant to be equally applicable to the pile
and the trough : — it is a fact which has been generally believed,
but which Mr. De Luc thinks he has demonstrated to be false.
With due deference to him, the following- appear to be conclu
sions fairly deducible from his analysis of the pile, in reference
to this subject.
    1. The necessary combination      for the greatest excitement,
consists of two dissimilar metals with a moist substance inter
posed between them.
   2. If this condition be observed, although no two metallic
surfaces be in contact, but merely connected by conducting
points, as in the first dissection, the effects will be the same, or
nearly the same, as if the. pile had not been dissected, but had
remained continuous, iu which state the different metallic sur
faces are in contact.
   3. If the pile be so dissected that two metallic surfaces be in
contact, but the moist substance in contact with only one of
them, if that one be the most oxidable metal, the powers of the
pile will only be diminished ; but if the metal in contact with
the moist substance be the least oxidable, then will the power of
the pile entirely cease.
   4. A solution of sea salt            is capable    of exciting more power
fully than common water. The same pila-which when excited by
water was only capable of affecting the electrometer and pro
ducing decomposition, when excited by a solution of muriate of
soda affected the electrometer, occasioned decomposition,  and
afforded a shock.
    5.   The power of vegetable and animal  substances to produce
excitement     is,                  proportion to their moisture;
                     coeteris paribus,       in
a  pile excited     new cloth, which had stood some time in a
                     by
room in which the hygrometer was at 40% being only capable
of affecting the electrometer, while the same pile excited    wet         by
cloth affected the electrometer and produced decomposition*.

 experiments, and without giving the grounds for his opinion,
 contends that the action of the pile does not depend on a sepa^
 ration of the binary groups of metals by a liquid or wet body,
 but requires only that the separation be produced " by the best
 non-metallic conducting substance." He thinks that in writing-
 paper he has found such a substance: but let me remind him
 that all paper attracts moisture very powerfully, that it is ex
 tremely difficult to deprive it entirely of moisture, and that, when
 it has been perfectly dried, it very soon reacquires moisture.
 Thus in an experiment (mentioned by Mr. De Luc) in which the
 paper had been completely dried, the pile did not even affect
 the electrometer, until during the time occupied in carrying it
 from one room to another it acquired some degree of moisture:
 it then affected the electrometer in a very slight degree. In
 fact, I believe it might be stated, that whatever conducting power
 paper may possess, is dependent on the moisture it contains.
 Thus in every instance of excitement, moisture (the decomposable
fluid) has been present : and from this view of the subject, I am
 somewhat inclined to think that the spontaneous electric column
-might be employed for hygroscopic purposes.
     I would wish, sir, your philosophical readers to ascertain the
 legitimacy of the inferences I have taken the liberty to draw
 from the experiments contained in Mr. De Luc's analysis of the
 Galvanic pile, and to declare whether there are any facts dedu-
 cible from those experiments, which tend to show a necessity
 for two metallic surfaces to be in contact to produce excitement;
 whether the facts do not establish a contrary opinion ; and
 whether the results of all his experiments do not tend to prove,
 that " the Galvanic apparatus can only be excited by a decom
 posable fluid." Nevertheless, Mr. De Luc states the elementary
 principles of the pile to be as follows :
     1. "In each binary group the zinc plate takes some electric
 fluid from its associate the copper."
     2. " In each group also the zinc plate communicates through
 the paper some of its excess of the electric fluid to the copper of the
 next group on its side."
     The first position is in direct opposition to my experiments;
 the second, M. DeLuc draws from his thirty-fourth experiment:
 vet, as far as I can understand     it,
                                       that experiment simply proves,
 that, the pile being excited, an insulated conductor will convey
 the charge of either extremity to the electrometer.

    Sir, — X he strange inconsistencies that subsist in the few facts
    that have been acknowledged to be true in the physiology of
    plants,    must show that they are in many respects false, since
    they    contradict  each other.        Thus, plants are supposed to per
    spire,    and  also  to give  out   oxygen.        It is well known that the/
    water they take in is decomposed, and reduced into its compo
    nent parts for the purpose.             How then can they give it out in
    oxygen and water also, when tl:nt water has been changed to air ?
    But they also admit that the cuticle takes in nutriment, and all
   from the same skin. This is really giving the cuticle more office*
    than Nature can perform, especially as they are all contradic
    tory.     Then it is supposed that the blood circulates, — thought
    the juice is evidently expended, as it rises, in forming the parts it
    is ordained to complete.           If it does circulate, it must do so in
    absolute opposition to the whole order of Nature; since even
     no animal respires by a particular organ, except those that have?
     a real circulation: for even in animals or insects there is no
  , Circulation    where there is not a single heart, to which the blood
     constantly returns, as the vessels that contain the liquid are so
     disposed, that it cannot arrive at the other parts till it has
     passed through the lungs.            This of course cannot take place in
     vegetables, which have no heart, nor in animals that have several
     hearts. — See the admirable Cuvier. — Again, in the herbaceous-
     plants they may be generally opened close to the root, and the
     flowers discovered aggregating there: — How then can the flower
     but be formed at the top of the plant, and come out in a few
-
    '4am also, without any preceding bud ? And in trees and shrubs,
     if the flower-buds are all cut oft when first appearing, a quantity
     will very soon succeed ; — cut these away also, and another set
     will reappear: this may be done two or three timet.                       Is it
     possible that all these flowers can proceed,            or  be formed, in the
     few buds that were found at the exterior in that place ? No : they
     are merely the vehicle through which the flowers in trees are
     introduced to the exterior; and the first flowers are there de
      tained in the bud till the weather is sufficiently favourable to per
     mit them to pass outwardly.               This is only learnt by dissecting
      progressively, and pursuing the various facts throughout all their
      appearances.

   herbaceous plant, in the progress of the flower-bud.           They bntfi
   form it in the root; but in trees and shrubs they make several
   stages, — in herbaceous plants but two.
      The first of the propositions selected for this letter, and which
   I engaged it should in a manner prove, was, " that the flower-
   bud was formed in the root, and of course that the root was the
   laboratory of plants;" since I before showed that the seeds were
   also protruded there. There are so many curious dissections
   appropriated to this subject, that it is peculiarly by specimens I
   must prove the truth of the fact.         I shall first show therefore,
  by   a  series  of prints (taken in  progressive order from the plants),
  how the flower-bud passes in trees and shrubs, from the moment
  of its formation to its decay; that the reader may be as capable
  of judging as if he had the plants before him, in regular suc
  cession ; since the specimens are the exact prototypes of the
  interior of the vegetable from which they are taken.                  And
  though every single specimen will not be given, on account of
  their number, yet I shall show the principal points of most of
  them, as they succeed each other.
      A soft ball appears in the middle of the root traced regularly
 from its first formation, by opening a fresh plant every third day.
  This ball is then in a little time seen to pass up the line of hie
  (a circle of cylinders discovered between the pith and wood), and
 which only enlarges at the flowering season for this purpose.
  This is never observed till a month or six weeks before or after
 flowering time.          By degrees each specimen shows the ball
 moving up towards that aperture from which it js to break ;
 while the cylinders naturally swell, and increase in size, ac
 cording to the quantity of buds ready to pass up (Plate L fig.                  I.)
 When they reach the part of the line of life from whence
 they are to be ejected from their place of concealment, the cy
 linder then opens, and one or two buds protrude, just opposite
 the ready made scales in the bark, which               in future prepared
                                                       is
to receive them, when they shall have passed the lignum part.
It   is  now they begin their passage through the wood, drawing'                 a
long string behind them (see fig. 2.). This may be seen, and dis
posed in different specimens in so many various ways, that a per
son must be blind or incredulous in the extreme, not to be con
vinced.        In the first specimen the bud may be caught moving
on, and drawing a string behind through the beginning layers                     of-
wood: then      by    cutting fresh specimens horizontally, and keep
ing them on the table       a   few hours, the bud,    if then placed un
der the microscope, will pass (while under your eye) out of the
wood.        In a specimen of new wood,           ifthe bark    istaken off
gently,      all the  buds  (being still incased in the wood) are left
there, and the scales alone remain in the bark; and                  in   fig.   3>

the division between the bud and the wood, occupied by the
juice, is plainly seen preparing its way: and every person on
viewing this figure, and who is apt to notice what they see, will
recollect this perpetual mark in the wood (o), which is nothing
more than the passing flower-bud : but the bud (as I have be
fore shown) does not force its passage, for the juice precedes                            it,
and has tire power of bending the wood twigs both ways from
the bud, forming   a complete covered way for    that with the            it,

                         a
ble for   afew hoiirs, the flowers will stand up above the cylinders,
and thus exactly distinguish the difference between the cases
and the buds, which from the extreme thinness and delicacy of

                 On the Physiology      of Vegetables.                 177
the matter, is not easy to do ; for the cylinders are so folded in
double or treble folds, that to an eye unused to the sight, they
would all appear like the most beautiful papier mache flowers,
only extremely small and delicate, and perfectly without colour.
But I have found another means of distinguishing the case from
the real buds: it is the dark or black shade always attending the
cylinders alone, as they are seen in contrast to the apertures,
which being then empty, most plainly appear : but when the
flowers mount them, they fill up the holes so thoroughly as to
leave no dark shadow to set them off.            I shall give a specimen
of cylinders without flowers (see fig. 6); and flowers without cy
linders, at fig. 7 ; also fig. \'3, joining both together, and showing
 (though very badly) the apertures up which the flowers mount.
When you cut perpendicularly, and happen to remove the soft
covering sufficiently to leave the flowers open to view, then they
show admirably ; for they are generally torn enough to remove
the thin matter, leaving the various sorts of vessels discoverable
between the cylinders.         Of these vessels I can say nothing, but
that I have most exactly copied them ; but what they are for, ex
cept to support the flowers, I cannot tell ; but we must truly
imitate till we can understand.         These large bouquets of flowers
adorned with hanging spirals, and adding grace and beauty to
the picture, I have truly delineated.          But I must observe that
they   are too   small   to show    all the defects the tearing might
produce, though       sometimes     observable  ; and only exhibit the
beauties arising from pressure, &c.            which    the opening and
closing flowers produce. The most perfect pattern-drawer would
be left far behind in this case : for so excessive          is the variety^
and so astonishing the beauty of these bouquets, that I in vain
endeavour to do them justice. When some corollas half open, they
appear like finished flowers: see fig. 8, 9, 10.               The aenan-
the,  the  angelica,    and   the  hieracium   spondylium, will give an
idea of some of these pictures: but to complete it I must show
the different specimens from which each part is taken in the
plants, as fig. 8*, fig. 9*, and fig. 10*, are a sextant of each speci
men, just cut at the top of the root, that^the reader may be a
proper judge of the curious manner in which the flowers are
arranged even in that situation.         The root must be cut slanting.
It must be remembered, that when the first specimen is ob
served, and when the flower-buds (in trees) leave the root, they
run directly into the cylinders of the line of life.           This is the
same in the plants that rise each year from the earth : they also
run into the same vessels, and are formed and conducted so far
 in the same manner; — but here ends the resemblance.
    I have shown how different the formation of the line of life         is,
and how much looser all the matter as given at fig. 11*, the

variety of cuticles being divided into layers, and each showing
such a number of apertures, through which the flowers shoot
(see AA), instead of a plain and regular set
                                                    of sheets (OO) as in
trees.   But   there  is  often,  as I before  observed,  a thing which
seems to confine this flexible matter,       and  give  the part the ap
pearance of different shaped vessels, as at fig. 8, 9, and 10.
This I cannot well understand ; but I have given each exactly
as it appeared to me ; subjecting both copy and original to the
opinion of many, who confirmed and reassured me as to the truth
of the likeness. However, when the flower rises above the root,
in herbaceous plants, each separate division shows again a more
marked line of life ; and if then the round stem is cut a little
slanting, this vessel will appear again with its bouquets, as it has
passed from the root upwards, (see fig. 1 2) .        After remaining a
time in this situation, a large collection of flowers begins to
gather in the middle of the stem, and you gradually see those
Of the line of life begin to empty : it generally takes five or six
increasing specimens to complete the whole process ; it is then
discovered that most of the flowers have left the vessels of the
line of life to gain this repository, (bb).      But it is not one only,
but two or three, according to the size of the plant.           Here they
receive their   seeds  and  pollen, and visibly   increase   in  size, and
then rise into perfect flowers by the growth of the stem (ccc.)
 Their passage from aaa to bbb is most plain, and easily traced,
for the first hour after you have cut the plant ; but it requires
 the eye to be accustomed to the microscope, to see it well ; and
 the moment the seeds enter the seed-vessels, they prove them
 the flowers.
    Can I then by any labour, or in any way, trace this series of
 facts in a more convincing manner ? These specimens were all
 taken from plants of the same kind in a series, as they appeared
 a few days older than the preceding ; and the progressive mo
 tion from bud to flower, from flower to fruit, is not plainer with
 out, than it is in the interior.      The difference between the tree
 and herbaceous plant is just sufficient to account for the winter
 hid in the former.      It will be remembered that this is the fourth
 year I have taken up plants in this manner : — The first year I cut
 eighty-six trees ; the second, seventy-eight ; and so on : and such
 loads of herbaceous, beginning long before they appeared above
 ground, that I have learnt all their winter process.            I am sure
 1 have cut many thousands within the last two years, subjecting
 every part to the microscope.          Does there appear then any
 room in this picture for self-imposition or mistake ?        I well know
 how false reasoning is ; but 1 reason not, I onlv trace a series of
 pictures presented in regular gradation by Nature: and though
 exhibiting so many different parts, which it would seem almost
                                                                impossible

impossible    to conciliate; yet, when joined together, they appear
so  consistent as not once to contrarlict or confuse each other :— -
the God of Nature alone could do this.          That I have in vain for
the last two years gone over and retraced every part : — the more
1 dissect, the more absolute my belief becomes.         And where are
the facts strong enough to make us sufficiently incredulous to
deny our eyesight ? Nowhere, but in a few mutilated propositions,
most of them showing their falsehood by contradicting                each
other.
    It is impossible to give to the public    a complete series  of facts,
eopied from Nature, and which forms a quarto in itself, in a
more disadvantageous manner than the present, since the first
letter is forgotten before the second is read, especially as these
facts (like a mathematical problem) all hang on each other, and
depend much on their general consistency for the proof of their
truth: —-but I have already sacrificed sixteen years, and to hazard
fortune    on the publication also, is too much.         Before I close
 my proposition       respecting   the  flower-bud,   I must    add one
 proof,  which   I have  shown  to many.     When   a quantity of young
 buds have just appeared above the stalk (suppose in umbelliferous
 flowers), if the first set are cut off, the aperture in which the
 flowers are rising up, is often so hollow and clear, that, look
 down near half a line, and you see the other flowers and buds
 coming up to supply the place of the dilapidated ones, or those
 which have died away.         Sure this also cannot be vain ; it must
 prove the flower is formed below, or all Nature is a deception !
 But we prefer gaining by reasoning, rather than by our eyes ;
 the latter often much more just, and more to be trusted to.               I
 must add, that experiments made on the living tree (if it is to
 stop any vessels, or alter tlie course of nature) are not to he trusted.
 1 experienced this in cutting off half a bean, and replacing it in
 the earth : the root, instead of coming out at the top, at the same
 orifice as the stem (as it always does), took a shorter road, and left
 the bean at the place it was cut.          In this manner Nature will
 deceive us — if the proper passage is stopped, it will form a new
 one for itself.     But watch, her, and she will ever be found the
 same : and if I only lay open a plant (without attempting to stop
 its vessels) , \t will, though languidly, continue its motions for
 near an hour, because its functions are all lengthways; and I shall
  not have impeded any of its nctions, but only displayed them.
 The flowers therefore will continue to rise for a short time, owing
  to the motion of the muscles.
     I now turn to my second proposition ; i( That the leaves are
  the lungs of the plant." This is universally allowed ; yet 1 never
  heard a. reason given "why they are so."               For the leaves

forming oxygen by the decomposition of water, is no reason at
all for such an appellation ; and it is certain that the leaves
contain vastly less air in their interior, than any other part of
the plant, and are not therefore a vehicle for air.    But though
they have no air within, thev still merit the name they have ac
quired, by being the constant cause of the motion of air at the
exterior; so that the very oxygen the leaves give out would pro
bably remain almost stationary, on account of its weight, under
the trees, rather than circulate around, were it not for the in
numerable little fans that by their incessant motion produce an
excessive circulation, which is rarely stopped, and is most violent
in the lowest spots, and where the general stagnation of air is
most likely to exist.   But the motion of the leaves not only
 changes the gases (which descend from the higher regions bv
 the help of the currents of air), but increases also the natural
 evaporation of the leaves.    How exquisitely beautiful is then the
 arrangement of the lungs of the plant, when they are considered
 as set in motion by the spiral wire or muscles of the plant, in or
 der to disperse the oxygen ! and that motion exactly propor
tioned by Nature to the situation of the ground, and the neces
sities of the sort of country in which they are placed ! On the
high hills of Scotland or Sweden, where no putrid air is disco
verable, the firs grow, which give but little oxygen ; for they have
no swamps to rectify, no animal breathing to purify: the na
 tural motion of the air is therefore exercise enough for them,
 and to disperse their pollen.    Hence the firs have no spiral wire
in their leaves, and in their leaves no motion, and fewer muscles
 (except in their wood) than any other plant. But behold the con
trast : — The low and swampy grounds loaded with aquatic plants
and trees, where constant motion is necessary to the purifying
of the air — Here Nature not only bestows a quantity of oxygen
 (which its trees emit continually), but she has loaded the
 peduncle of the leaf with a quantity of spiral wire, which keeps
 its leaves in perpetual motion. View only the alele, or the black
poplar.     It is not because its leaf-stalk is broad one way and
 thin the other (see fig. 14), that the leaf is for ever moving: this
shape would cause its constant action, when the wide part of
 the leaf was facing the wind. But what (but the muscle) could
 keep it constantly in that position?       The muscles alone could
 do this, by contracting and dilating  it,  according to the dryness
 or moisture of the wind that blows.         It   is   by
                                                       this means the
.leaf-stems of all the poplars area  trifle more or less turned to the
 wind, and in this position they will ever be found.     Those plants
 have most spiral wire which grow in swampy grounds         ;    those
 trees have most motion that are buried in low valleys, where
                                                                  bofh

 both arr and water at times would almost become stagnate if it
 were not for the spiral wire in the leaves.   But so beautifully has
 Nature contrived her laws, that the very moisture of the water, by
 causing constant motion in the leaves, gives also increased mo
 tion to the water, and that water additional freshness to the air j
 while the deep valleys, which have quantities of aquatic plants,
 want (more thoroughly than any other) to have the oxygen
 mixed with all other gases, to purify the atmosphere.       How ex
 quisite then is this continual interchange of benefits ! — how de
 lightful then the discovery, " that not only the quantity of oxy
 gen is doubled in those vegetables found in low grounds, but the
 spiral wire is also increased in an equal degree !"    Thus botanic
 physiology perfectly agrees with atmospheric chemistry, to en
force the welfare and establish the happiness of each animal
 that lives and breathes ; and not only of those whose scent and
 wholesome breathing is thus secured; but of those inanimate
 beings who receive health and nutriment from the very spoiled
 air that is thus drawn off, and imbibed by them for their benefit,
 Hydrogen and fixed air being in small degrees serviceable to
 plants in general, though they will not grow in that air alope,
 their absorption is of the utmost use to man and animals. Thus,
 if the spiral was not the muscle of the plant, how could all this
 be brought about? — how could the leaves be moved in stagnate,
 situations ? — how could the oxygen get thoroughly mixed in the
 higher regions? It would remain under the trees, to do harm to
 the vegetable world; and so far from curing the bad vapours in
 low morasses, they would be left in their putrid state, to give
 death to those who entered the valley.      As the moist winds act
 on the leaf of the poplars, so do they also on the corolla of
 flowers, turning the back of the antirrhinum and pea-flower to
 defend the pollen from the moist winds.       How exquisitely sen
 sible are the muscles of the plant! If a moist wind blows, they
 will lengthen more and more, till they have lost all the twist of
 their spiral wire: — if a dry north or east wind is felt, the muscle
 will contract to half its length.    If there is no muscular con
 traction, what makes the malva flower in certain dry winds push
 off the whole of its corolla, by contracting the calyx to such a
 degree as absolutely to pinch off the petals altogether?      I have
 often seen above twenty flowers thus forced off, one after the
 other, in an over-dry season.       Those who do not look on the
 spiral wires as the muscle of the plant, but as sap-vessels,
 should show us how a flower is opened and shut ; how the ten
 drils twist, both within and at the exterior of the flower ; how
 those tendrils twist, that cover the whole surface of a plant in
 the way of hairs ; — but particularly how the wood warps.       They

pfoceed evidently all from one cause. What power acts on it ?
What action remains so long after the death of the tree ? We
do not believe in witchcraft, and an action must have a cause.
A being dies : all motion ceases after death, except one, which is
involuntary muscular motion.       The wood warps after death, it
is full of spiral wire: it is this which most evidently causes its
motion, since, if you take a part of it out, all motion ceases, and
that part taken out moves continually.         If this is the case, it
must be the muscle of the plant:    and  the warping is at once ac
counted for, being the only part of the animal which moves after
death : it is also the only part of the vegetable which retains its
action after the vital power is extinct. We are not to judge
a living being by the laws of non-exhting matter; that matter
which is made and joined molecule to molecule, may increase
by heat, which divides these parts by separating them at a
greater or smaller distance.       Thus iron is increased by the
quantity of caloric introduced between each molecule.        But how
can this law be carried into a living body ? Vitality is actuated
by a totally different power, and partakes completely of the
animal in this respect, increasing in continuity; and forced to
action by the power of the muscles only, after vitality should be
dissolved.
    I think I have so exactly marked the difference (with the help of
Mirbel's ingenious idea) between the animal, vegetable, and mi
neral, that they can no longer be considered as flowing into each
other, or making a series of steps, but perfectly disjointed, and
different from each other, and peculiar in all their parts.       The
animal having life, brain, nerves, muscles, voluntary and in
voluntary motion.      The vegetable life, but neither brain nor
nerves, but irritability of muscle even superior to animal life*,
these serving instead of nerves.     Hence in death the vegetable
cannot be considered as a being to be contracted or dilated, as
iron or water, and which is removed by heat molecule from
molecule; but as a living creature, which has muscles to move,
and which, when dead, can only be subservient to the action of
the muscles for a time, and which are, like all vegetable muscles,
set in motion by the powerful change of light and moisture, but
subject to no other contracting or dilating power.          And if in
such full proof we want an additional one, to show that the spiral
   * This irritable or contractile power, is that
                                                    property by which mus
cles recede from stimuli; it is independent of the nerves, and so little
connected with feeling, that upon cutting away all the nerves and stimulate
ing the muscle with a sharp-pointed instrument, or a caustic, or directing
the electric spark through it,the muscles instantly contract, as does also the
vegetable.

  I    shall now turn to the third and last proposition            am toI
 give in this letter, which      equally new, and taken from the dis
                                   is
 section of plants.      It   " that the corolla of flower formed
                              is                                    &   is
 by bubbles of water placed in rows, and owes all the beauty and
 lightness of its tints to the refraction and reflection of the sun
 on the balls of water which compose its pabulum."
     The corolla, to be known, must be taken to pieces. There                          is
 some art required to do this; for,        the petals are at all pressed,
                                                  if
 they are destroyed they soon break their bubbles and spill their
                     ;
liquid, and thus spoil the whole specimen (as may be seen                              by
pressing one).       But  it   possible to take the petal of each dif

ferent cuticles will then          placed in the microscope) properly

tle divided, each will rise to its proper height, and enable the
eye to distinguish them from each other, and not in any man
ner confuse their parts together. Taking the corolla in this man
ner, the pabulum     is soon discovered to be balls of water laid in
rows and this even the naked eye in some flowers will show
      ;                                                                                ;

skin is within, the white is without. But in flowers, the pabulum
is white, and the upper and under cuticles coloured.                To the
pabulum     the  petals of flowers  are  indebted  for  their brilliant ap
pearance,     and  not  to the  juice   which  inflates   them   (which is
generally of a dull and livid colour) ; but the bubbles receiving
the rays of the sun, and returning them to the retina through
these colours, paint them with a vivid glow impossible to ex
press in words ; but easily shown by throwing the light of the
sun through a small glass bubble on the dullest colour imagi
nable, and it immediatelv returns the brightest of tints.             Thus
these bubbles receiving the rays of the sun (which strike each
drop of water) are enlivened and enlightened by the reflection and
refraction of that bright ray of light seen in every bubble, and
striking the retina, by which means the whole flower would be
come a blaze of light too violent for the eyes, had not Nature,
to soften         it,
                  covered     with
                                 it    cuticle of a gauze-like texture,
                                           a

 that,  in spite of the upper cuticle, much heat must be evolved                         ;

             it                                                  received a    I

I  have ever seen on the subject was one made          the excellent      by
Mons. Hubert in the island of Bourbon; but          given bv Mons.

this in Fahrenheit would be 50" and 62°.       Now how could Ma-
dame's hand, which even supposing her seventy, could not be less
than 75° in that climate, feel 62° hot to her hand; when                                 it
was thirteen degrees cooler than her own flesh, and would there
fore be cold to          it  ?
    I cannot help thinking that there was so much handling, and
cutting, and placing the plant round the instrument, that the
hand must have communicated much of the heat            possessed to      it
the vegetable     held. it    certainly was neither the corolla nor
                                      It

pieces and disposed round the thermometer, and all motion must
soon have ceased in thus dismembering the plant.       However, we

                   On the Physiology of Vegetalles.                 1  85
are not fair judges without trying the same plant the same way.
When he tried the common arum in the interior of the corolla
in the sun, it gave 6 or 7 above the state of the atmosphere.
I never got Hubert's account till after my own trials were com
pleted ; but 1 have since tried to cut the spadixes of the arum,
and place them in the manner directed ; but it had no effect on
the thermometer.
    I shall now explain the trials I made both before and after I
received Sir J. E. Smith's letter : every thing that could be done
to guard the plant from receiving any heat from the hand was
done.     Having arranged the approaches round the flowers to be
tried the evening preceding, a stick was placed to which the
thermometer of comparison was affixed, and a contrivance which
enabled me to slip on or off a paper cover, when I wished to try
the seeds, that I might not, when the pericarpium was below the
flower, be obliged to pass the instrument through the corolla,
but into the seed-vessel at once, without the bulbs being exposed
to the atmospheric air: some sticks were so placed that I could
run the thermometer into the flower without injury, by the help
of a pair of long pincers, and the whole was covered with a large
umbrella to be turned off and on, as required.            I began at
seven o'clock in the morning.

 When I tried the seeds, the bulb was placed in the midst of
 them, without passing through the corolla.         The result may, I
 think, therefore, be fairly stated ; that the greatest part of the
 heat (which was supposed to result from the seeds only) cer
 tainly comes from the corolla: for, cover the thermometer when
 taken from the open air by any thing, and it will rise nearly one
                                                                degree ;

   degree; the seeds gain only 2\ ;    if indeed it is      any thing, the
   quantity of caloric must be very small, and only at the time of
   fructification, which may arise from the quicker motion of that
   season ; since it is certain that at no moment the seed is liable
   to so hasty a revolution, as when the inside of the heart first
   forms itself.     But the heat the corolla gives is a decided heat ;
   and it is to be discovered in every flower that will admit the
  bulb; and I should suppose intended to accelerate the fructifi
   cation of the seeds, the completion of the juice of the pistil, which
   for the purpose above mentioned may require to be raised to a
   certain temperature before it is fit to pass down the pistil into
  the seeds.      I always shaded those flowers that were afterwards
  to be exposed to the sun, till two or three minutes before the
  experiment began, or probably the heat would have been higher.
  But it is not certainly owing to the polished surfaces of the pe
  tals, for nothing can be less smooth in the microscope : but it
  is owing to the balls of water that compose the pabulum, which
  reflects heat from each bubble of water and light; and if the sun
  is hot enough to decompose the water (which it certainly does
  in those petals that have hairs), it of course must reflect great
  heat from the pabulum; and this may always be increased by
  taking off the upper cuticle.      But it is not to one sort of form
 the corolla is   confined, though, except the Everlasting, the pabu
  lums are all formed of bubbles of water.         But there are wet pe
  tals, such as the hyacinth, which, though they are so filled with
 liquid, it is quite wonderful how tire skin can keep it from
 oozing, yet detain the liquid in such a manner as not to wet the
 hand on whieh it reposes.        This is really a wonderful thing, and
 shows in how great a perfection Nature has made these skins,
 which not only may be so filled with liquor as to be greatly in
 flated, but also so thin as to appear perfectly transparent, yet
 cover the water sufficiently to keep it from too great an evapo
 ration, and enough to allow it to decompose water, which the
 corollas that have hairs certainly do.
     There are still more curious corollas, one sort in particular,
which we have so exactly imitated in forming velvet, that it is
impossible not to be struck with the similarity of the formation.
The upper coloured cuticle is formed of a vessel carried up and
down in scollops, and then cut at the top ; — this appears to pro
long the ray of light which falls on     it,    instead of absorbing or

to a    hot country, have probably their corolla formed of greater
consistency, that the water may not too soon evaporate in the
bubbles.       When the corolla is thick or thin, it is the increase or
decrease of their pabulum only to which that circumstance is
owing, — every other part is the same.
      The Everlastings have the pabulum made of powder instead
of water, and certainly give no heat whatever, but retain their
form and beauty for a long time, not fearing the general enemy
of flowers evaporation, — dust being their only destroyer.
      But the most curious plant in respect to dissection is the
ranunculus ficaria and lulhosus, which have their pabulum co
vered with a brilliant white powder, which seems not only to re
 fract great light and heat from the bubbles, but from the pow
 der also.     But such was the badness of the weather, that I have
 not been able to try the heat they give; the flower is indeed al
 most too small to introduce the bulb of the thermometer.
      I shall now touch, though gently, on the means by which these
 flimsy bodies (the petals of flowers) are sustained and strengthened,
 so as to bear much pressure and much ill usage, and to preserve
 their elegant shapes in spite of wind and rain. No one would for
 a moment doubt that the spirals governed the petals of flowers,
 if they would watch them for a few minutes as I have done for
 days, nay weeks together.
                               — How often have I seen one of the pe
 tals contract   its motions  before the rest were at all sensible of the
  impulsion; twist and furl its sail- like wings, lay them fold on
  fold, exactly according to the drawing of the spiral! I know not
  any better means to show the muscles, and how completely the
  spiral is that part of the vegetable, than exposing them to a va
  riety of temperatures — both extremes of heat and cold will act
  equally on them ; they contract, then lengthen, and at last be
  come vapid and dead,^-lose all the stiffness of their spiral, which
  untwists and breaks, and the water immediately evaporates from
   the bubbles : — you then plainly see the skins in which the water
   was confined : and I do not think I ever was more surprised than
   to fmd that each bubble was opened and shut by a spiral wire ;
   but they are not smaller than the eyes of many insects, in which
   so much mechanism is discovered. — But we are for ever to be
   reminded, that to Almighty power there is no small or great.
       In the corolla Nature seems to have sported with a vivacity
   calculated to exhibit her powers: and beautiful is it to follow the
    pea or the bean in its various species, which discover a variety
    quite as astonishing; and when the simple direction of the mus
   cles is not sufficient to manage its folds, a certain piece is formed
    like the strengthening piece of an instrument, being a treble
    fold of the pabulum, from which the vessels are allowed to take
                                                                     their

their exit ai from a centre, and it serves as a strong part to ac
celerate and fortify the powers before given to it by the muscular
force. I think, any one who will examine the strength of the bean
banner on the back of the red antirrhinum with care, can never
attribute such force to any thing but a muscle pervading all ve
getable life.   The foldings of the last-mentioned flower are art
ful and powerful, and the springs so admirably contrived as to
merit peculiar attention ; — most of the flowers of that kind have
tuo side-springs to connect the two parts of the corolla together;
they are unusuallv strong muscles. Try their strength, and they
will be found powerful; they lock one within the other: but when
the flower is dead, if the spring is examined, all the spiral will be
found dead and unwound, and broken in various places.
    I shall in a future letter give some beautiful specimens of the
mechanism Nature contrives in the opening and closing of the
flowers.    The mechanic power is easily seen, so plain and sim
ple as to explain itself.    I shall also give a guess, " why Nature
does so at such different hours."        It is a curious subject : but
a  few general principles   will be found  to disseminate their powers
in a such a manner throughout all vegetable life, as to be fully
competent to manage the whole ; and I hope by continuing my
dissections, and trusting to Nature only to prove her own work,
she will bring conviction of this important truth, and that I have
nothing to do in       it,
                       but obey and follow her.

     Perhaps I had most wisely avoided giving the figures described
 at figs. S, 9 and 10, as carrying so little probability in their ap
 pearance ; — but when I first began to dissect and imitate the
 vegetable tribe, I most absolutely determined that I would li
 terally draw all I saw, without exaggeration and without dimi
 nishing the objects presented to my sight, let them be ever so
 extraordinary.        No one had before taken a review of these ob
 jects,  — all that   was supposed to be known, was very little more
 than conjecture, except the seeds : no one had attempted to
  take the specimens progressively — what the interior was, there
         " was
  fore,          (till now) a secret ;" and after sixteen years constant
 dissection I cannot be accused of ignorance. With this observa
  tion I leave it to public opinion.
  XXXVIII.         On   Sir H. Davy's Safe-lamp for Mines.            By
                John    George    Children, Esq. F.R.S.
                              To  Mr. Tillock.
            I
  Sir, — read with some degree of indignation, in the Annals
  of Philosophy for July last, a paper by a Mr. Longmire, calling
  itself Remarks, &cc. on Sir Humphry Davy's Safe-lamp for the Col-       .
  liers ; and I addressed a letter to Dr. Thomson on the subject.
  That letter the learned Editor of the above Journal has thought
  fit to suppress ; — nor should I have considered it worth while to
  take even this brief notice of . so weak an attempt to injure one
  of the most important inventions with which enlightened genius
  has ever blessed the world, but have left it to perish in its own
                                                                   insig-

  insignificance and      be forgotten, had I not found the subject pur
  sued in a letter from a Mr. Holmes, in the succeeding number
  of the same publication.        The avowed intention of the author
  of this paper,     and  the  experiments on which he pretends to
  ground his objections, seem to me to require some animadver
  sion, not indeed from the liberality of the former, nor the re
  liance (as I shall show presently) that is to be placed on the fi
  delity of the latter, or the inferences deduced from them; but
  from the possibility that, if they pass altogether unnoticed, an
  opinion may prevail, among those who have not sufficiently con
  sidered the subject, that they are founded in truth. As the re
  sults of Mr. Holmes's experiments are diametrically the reverse
  of similar ones by Sir Humphry himself, I thought it right in
  the first place to examine their accuracy; and with that view I
  submitted the safe-lamp to the most rigorous trials, and under
  circumstances as analogous to those which prevail in the coal
  mines as I could devise.       For this purpose, I caused a cylinder
  of strong tin plate to be constructed fourteen inches in length
  and five in diameter, having four tubes         the bottom half an
                                                ill
  inch wide, and one inch long each, placed two and two opposite
  one another and one inch from the circumference          ; and three
  other pairs of similar size, fixed in the sides of the cylinder, each
 tube on the same level being opposite to its fellow.       The lowest
 pair were three inches from the bottom, the middle six, and
 the upper pair nine inches distant from the same point.             Bv-
 means of these tubes      Icould expose the lamp to atmospheres of
 various degrees of inflammability, and     I could also force the gas
 into the cylinder with greater or less violence, and at different
 heights, from bladders connected with stop-cocks, as well as
 project into   it such substances, in fine powder, either above, be
 low, or on level with the flame of the lamp, as might be thought
            a
 likely to communicate explosions, through the wire-gauze, to
the atmosphere surrounding         it;— and could distinctlv observe
                                            I
the phenomena through small squares of glass fixed in the sides,
so as to afford a full view of what passed in the interior of the
lanthorn. Not having any of the real fire-damp of the mines,
I   substituted for  it the more inflammable gas obtained from the
distillation   of coal,  and consequently the trials of the safety of
 the instrument became so much the more severe.            The lamp      I
employed was made           by
                             Mr. Newman of Lisle-street.       It  nine
                                                                    is
inches high, and the gauze cylinder, which            isconstructed of
simple iron wire,     is   1
                           \  inch in diameter — the diameter of the
wire being -^d of an inch, and the apertures, of which there are
960 to the square inch, TVth. This lamp gives an excellent
light with spermaceti oil, which continues undiminished many
hours. — will first briefly mention Mr. Holmes's experiments,
        I
                                                                    and

               On  Sir H. Davy's Safe-lamp for Mines.              191
and    then state those which I made. I should perhaps have
rather given the credit of these experiments to Mr. Ryan, as it
seems it was he who first made them ; but as he " practised on
a lamp of only one inch diameter," he coincided with Mr. Holmes
in opinion that his trials were unfair ; and Mr. Holmes having
procured a lamp from Newman, the following experiments were
made by himself and Mr. Ryan, partly at the gas-works in Dorset-
street, and partly at a chemist's, in the presence of four other
gentlemen. — I quote Mr. Holmes's words:
     " I tried it first over a small gas tube, with coal-dust and
powder, which ignited the gas outside; next with coal-dust alone,
which after repeated trials produced the same results, and left
 an inflammation at the end of the tube."
     " On inverting a teacup over the cylinder so as to produce
 a slight compression of the gas, it exploded from coal-dust se
 veral  times."                          '
     "  We then went to a chemist's and forced some gas from a
 bladder against one side of the cylinder, while gas from another
 bladder was gently pressed on the opposite side : in a short
 time the gas on the outside inflamed ; — this I compare to a
 blower, although the power we were able to use was very in
 ferior to what would be given by the velocity of a blower under
 ground." — " I found that the flame of the wick would not pe
 netrate the gauze cylinder, but the inflammation of the gas
 would, when acted upon by a strong current of air."
     I shall now state my own experiments: — I suspended the safe-
 lamp in the centre of the lanthorn, at about two inches from the
 bottom, the four bottom apertures and the top of the lanthorn
 being open — I then forced coal-gas, from a bladder, with all the
 violence I could into the lanthorn through one of the lowest side
 apertures, an assistant at the same time throwing in atmospheric
  air from another bladder, through the middle aperture, on the
  opposite side, the other lateral apertures being closed.    In a few
  seconds, about two inches of the wire gauze became red hot, and
  by continuing the blast from each bladder it rose almost to white
  ness, the heat being greatest at the side opposite the jet of at
  mospheric air. — At this point the exterior gas exploded.       In a
  former experiment of the same kind, in which the heat of the
  wire was not raised above a low red heat, no explosion ensued.
      Mr. Holmes says he " cannot find that even this distinguished
  chemist" (SirH. Davy) "has been able to explain why flbme
  will not flow through small apertures." -
      Mr. Holmes cannot have taken much pains in his search ; for
  in the first part of the Philosophical Transactions for the present
  year, at page 1 1 7, Sir Humphry says as follows :
     " If a piece of wirer-gauze sieve is held over a flame of a lamp
                                                                     or

                     is                                              the wire-      by

perhaps as high as any we are acquainted with — Mr. Tennant
was in the habit of showing an experiment, which demonstrates
the intensity of its heat.           He used to fuse      small filament of
                                                                          a

 quote more of this interesting paper, though                recommend theI
whole to the careful perusal both of Mr. Holmes and the other
opposers of the
                     " wonderful lamp." —The experiment have de                     I

a  red heat the wire cooled the gas below the point of inflamma

is evident,    that  most extraordinary carelessness must co-operate
with most extraordinary circumstances, to make an explosion
possible from the mere flame of the fire-damp burning in the
lamp.     We must therefore inquire how correct the experi
ments of Mr. Holmes are                and we shall see presently, that

 \fWn    fairly   stated and rationally investigated, not one        of
 them militates     in the slightest degree against the perfect safety
 of the lamp. — And here it may very probably be urged, and
 with perfect truth, that all this was known before, from Sir
 Humphry Davy's own experiments, and consequently that mine
are quite superfluous. — I readily admit it.      Sir Humphry, at the
first suggestion that danger was apprehended by the miners from
the coal-dust, immediately submitted the lamp to rigorous trials,
to prove how well or ill their fears were founded. He repeatedly
threw coal-dust,        powdered rosin, and witch meal, through
lamps burning in more explosive mixtures than ever occur in
coal-mines ; and though he kept these substances floating in the
explosive atmosphere, and. heaped them upon the top of the
lamp when it was red hot,-yet he never could communicate ex
plosions by means of them.         Phosphorus and sulphur only pro
duced that effect by being applied to the outside of the lamp,
and even they required to be in large quantities and blown upon
ly a current of fresh air. — Vide Philos. Magazine, vol. xlviii.
p. 54.     The liberal and enlightened will not be disposed to
question the truth of this statement, from one whose candour
and accuracy are equally acknowledged ; and to such all further
evidence is work of supererogation, — to them I do not write: —
but we have seen, unhappily, that all are not of that class; and
though I do not hope to reclaim the perverse and malicious, I
notwithstanding am anxious, as far as my feeble efforts can assist,
to prevent others really desirous of the truth, from being misled
iuto the path of error and unfounded scepticism.          Feelings of
attachment towards a man whom I glory in calling my friend,
cannot but create in me a warm interest for all that tends to
exalt the lustre of his well-acquired fame; — but beyond the feel
ings of friendship, or the fame of my friend, 1 am anxious for
the prevalence of truth, and that one of the greatest benefits
 science ever conferred on humanity should shed the full influence
                                                                       "
of its blessing, spite of the malicious insinuations of ignorance
 and envy. — I return to the experiments.
    Exp. 1. I suspended the lamp in my lauthorn and threw in
 the coal-gas from a bladder as before ; and when the gauze cy
linder was filled with flame, a mixture of about three parts of
finely levigated coal-dust and one part of gunpowder-dust        was
thrown into the lauthorn, which occasioned an abundance of
 sparks within the gauze cylinder, but no explosion of the ex
 terior gas.
 . Exp. 2.     I fixed a small trav of very thin copper-plate, con
 taining  the   mixture of coal-dust and gunpowder, about three
inches above the wick of the lamp within the gauze cylinder,
 suspended the lamp in the lanthorn,        and threw in the gas as
    Vol. 48. No. 221. Sept. 1816.             N               before.

before.       The mixture took fire in the tray as soon as enveloped
by    the  inflamed   gas, and burnt with a very large flame mixed
 with innumerable scintillations ; but no explosion (though the
 experiment was continued till all the gas of a very large bladder
 was expended) could be produced.
      Exp. 3. The lamp and lanthom being arranged as before, the
                                                                       and the
 gas was thrown in at one of the lowest side apertures,
 coal-dust and gunpowder at an upper one, and a current of air
 forced on the inflamed gas from another bladder through the
                                                                           and
 opposite middle opening. The whole burned with a very full
                                                                    almost   to
 strong flame, and the scintillations were so violent            as
 resemble the tail of a sky-rocket, and the wire-gauze                soon be
 came red hot, but no explosion ensued.               Had I continued the
  experiment     till the  wire-gauze  became    nearly   white hot, an ex
 plosion of course would         have followed  ; but  it would take place
  as certainly without the coal-dust.          It is  therefore    fairly esta
  blished that coal-dust cannot communicate flame             to  the  external
  air, when the lamp is immersed in the most explosive mixtures.
       I repeated the last experiment with the double lamps, and also
  without the coal-dust,        and used every endeavour to produce an
  explosion, but without effect.        I raised the wire-gauzes to a dull
  red heat, but could not get them hot enough to suffer flame to
  pass through. In every case possible, therefore, the
                                                                 double lamp
  is perfectly secure; and, unless in the hands of an idiot or a mad
  man, the single is hardly less so; — nothing but a current of air,
   directing the flame with considerable force to one point, can
  heat the gauze sufficiently for flame to traverse it ; — and should
   such a current be met with in the mine, it must inevitably ex
   tinguish the lamp, and thus be itself the safeguard from its own
   danger.
        Mr. Holmes, however, caused explosions by holding the lamp
   over a small gas tube, and projeeting coal-dust and gunpowder
   and even coal-dust alone, on it ; and I understand the same ef
   fect has been produced in the laboratory of the Royal Institution.
    In those experiments, I am told the lamp was held nearly hori
    zontally over the pipe of the large gasometer (and consequently
    the full heat of the flame from the wick of the lamp con
    stantly directed to one point), and coal-dust thrown on the top
    of the gauze.       Mr. Holmes does not state in what direction he
    held his lamp.       In this arrangement it is obvious that a current
    of fresh air round the lamp is established, the coal-dust is
    heated red by contact with the wire-gauze, and its ignition in
    creased by the current of air; and thus it reaches the tempera
     ture at which it can explode the circumambient gas ; but this
    will not happen, without that partial current, which can never
     prevail in the mine; nor I believe will it happen at all, if the lamps

            On Srr          H. Davy's Safe-lamp for Mines.             195
be held vertically ; at least I made repeated attempts to produce
an explosion with the lamp in that position, the gas being
thrown into it in the free atmosphere in vain, although I kept
the whole cylinder a considerable         time completely filled with
flame, and the powdered mixture           constantly projected into it ;
but when inclined, I succeeded.         A mixture of gunpowder with
the coal was however necessary; without it I could obtain no ex
plosion, nor with it could I always succeed ; never, indeed, till
after the gas had been thrown in long enough to heat the wire
very hot ; but, — and it proves the accuracy of the reasoning ou
the experiment, — when once an explosion was effected, it might
be repeated at pleasure, provided the gauze cylinder was not
suffered to cool.     With the double lamps 1 could not by any
means produce an explosion, whatever position it was held in.
     I placed coal-dust and gunpowder on the top of the wire-
gauze cylinder suspended in the lanthorn, and threw in the coal-
gas.      The whole cylinder was filled with flame, and the upper
part became red hot. The mixture burned, and threw off sparks,
but occasioned no explosion.          On putting a lighted match into
the lanthorn the gas immediately exploded with violence.
     The same experiment was repeated with the addition of a jet
of atmospheric air thrown from a bladder with a small blow
 pipe on the ignited coal and powder dust — but neither in this
 case did any explosion ensue.
     A few words more, and I have done.          Mr. Holmes seems in
 clined to hint that Sir Humphry Davy has borrowed the idea of
 his lamp from Stevenson's, and talks of the " alteration" he has
 made on    it,  "      weaving the holes instead of having them
                       by
 punched."    If    Mr. Holmes were acquainted with the progress
 of the investigation        by
                            which Sir Humphry was led, step       by
                                                                   step,
 from successivelv   established   facts to the present perfection of
 the instrument, he would know that Sir H. borrowed no idea
 concerning it   from Mr. Stevenson or any one else.          was early
                                                             It
 in   last October that Sir Humphry communicated in confidence
  to me the discovery of the principle which was the base of his
  subsequent reasonings, viz. the narrow limits in which the pro
  portions of atmospheric air and fire-damp can be combined so
  as to afford an explosive mixture; — and on the following          day
  he showed Mr. Brande and myself the experiments which con
  firmed its accuracy.      Like every thing else that Sir Humphry
  has done, this lamp      the result of consequences most sagaciously
                             is
  deduced from causes most ingeniously and diligently inquired
  into ;— andis   itto be bofne, that the labours of such     aman are
   to be made the subject for every envious caviller to vent his spleen
   on? or that    itshould be insinuated, that their results are pla

     Manager of that Establishment.
                             To Mr.   Tillock.
 Sir, -—I hope     you will permit me, through your excellent publi
 cation, to endeavour to remove any unfavourable impression which
 may have been made by a paper on Sir H. Davy's Safety-lamp, in
 the August Number of the Annals of Philosophy, by a Mr. Holmes,
 relative to some experiments conducted at the Gas Establishment
 in Dorset-street, with which I am connected.
     Mr. Holmes speaks of a visit to the works for the purpose of
 trying experiments on Sir H. Davy's safety-lamp, and mentions
 persons who were present at the trials. Does Mr. Holmes publish
 their names, to attach importance to his liberal investigation ?
 If he does, it is fair to ask what credit his experiments derive
 from the presence of Mr. Wheatcroft,          who is employed here to
 pay   the workmen   ;   Mr.  Morris, who    superintends the works by
 night ;   and  Mr.  May,    of whom    I  never   heard before he ob
 tained importance in Mr. Holmes's letter.            How Mr. Holmes
 had access to the works, I know not ; nor would I or any other
 proprietor knowingly lend ourselves, or the establishment, to ex
 periments not openly conducted.           Whenever gentlemen, who
 are men of science, have wished to visit the works, an applica
  tion has been usually made to me as engineer, and I have al
  ways been ready to afford free inspection, and give every facility
  to experiments ; but in this instance I never heard of Mr.
  Holmes or his visit till I saw his own report in the Annals of
 Philosophy, and that only yesterday, when the last number was
 put into my hands. As the active partner and manager of the

 Suggestions arising from Inspections      of Wire-gauze Lamps.    197
establishment, and having my name and credit more immedi
ately connected with the works than any other proprietor, I feel
myself called on to disclaim participation in any experiments con?-
ducted there by Mr. Holmes, with results so opposite to those of
other persons, who with liberal motives have felt anxious to prove
the security which Sir H. Davy's discovery promises, and with
the benevolent hope of its application to the safety of the mem
bers of a valuable class of society.       After what I have seen and
heard of Sir H. Davy's lamp, my conviction of its security is
not shaken by Mr. Holmes's report, which looks more like an
endeavour to serve his friend Dr. Clanny than the public.
   Any means which our works in Dorset Street can afford to
scientific and liberal men, of investigating further the applica^
tion of Sir H. Davy's or any other discovery, will be granted

XL.      Suggestions arising from Inspections          of Wire-gauze
   Lamps, in their working State, in Mines. By         Sir H. Davy.
The     inspection of a number of wire-gauze safe-lamps, that have
been long in common use in coal mines, and the examination
of the effects of different explosive atmospheres of fire-damp
upon them, enable me to offer a few suggestions, which I hope
will  be of use to the miner.
   The wire-gauze cylinders ought never to be taken out of the
screw-piece in which they are fixed ; and in the lamps con
structed at Newcastle, which have not the same rim of wire-
gauze as those of Newman's construction, the wire-gauze ought
to be soldered to the screw-piece, or fixed to it by rivets.
   The wire-gauze is easily cleaned without being detached, by
a brush of the same kind as that used for cleaning bottles, and
one of these brushes ought to be furnished with every lamp.
   The wire-gauze in several lamps in the collieries, which had
been in use six months, and cleaned by careful workmen with
out being removed, was as good as new ; whereas the gauze in
some, that had been used for a much shorter time, and taken
out of the lamp and cleaned roughly, was injured at the bottom,
and, if not actually unsafe, becoming so.
    In one instance, I found a lamp which had been furnished to
a workman without a second top.             This is a gross and unpar
donable instance of carelessness in the maker, who, if any acci
dent had happened, would have been guilty of homicide.
                                 N3                                A1J

198                   Suggestions arising    from
    All the lamps that I have examined have at different times
been red hot ; and a workman at the Hebburn colliery showed
me a lamp, which, though it had been in use about sixteen hours
a-day, for nearly three months, was still in excellent condition :
he also said it had been red hot sometimes for several hours
together.      Wherever workmen, however, are exposed to such
highly    explosive mixtures, double gauze lamps should be used,
or a lamp in which the circulation of air is diminished by a tin-
plate reflector placed in the inside, or a cylinder of glass reaching
as high as the double wire, with an aperture in the inside ; or
                                                                            "
slips of Muscovy glass may be placed within the lamp, and in
this way the quantity of fire-damp consumed, and consequently
 of heat produced, may be diminished to any extent.           Such lamps
 likewise may be more easily cleaned than the simple wire-gauze
 lamp; for the smoke may be wiped off in an instant from the
 tin-plate or glass*.
     If a blower or strong current of fire-dampis to be approached,
 double gauze lamps, or lamps in which the circulation of air is
 interrupted by slips of metal or glass, should be used ; or, if the
 single lamp be employed, it should be put into a common horn or
 glass lanthorn, the door of which may be removed or open.
     The wire gauze is impermeable to the flame of all currents of
 fire-damp, as long as it is not heated above redness ; but if the
 iron wire be made to burn, as at a strong welding heat, of course
 it can be no longer safe; and though such a circumstance can
  perhaps never happen in a colliery, yet it ought to be known and
  guarded against. And if a workman, having a single lamp, should
  accidentally meet a blower acting on a current of fresh air, he
  ought, on fmding his lamp becoming hot, to take it out of the
  point of mixture, or screen it from the current.
      I have had an excellent opportunity of making experiments on
  a most violent blower, at a mine belonging to J. G. Lambton, esq.
  some of them in the presence of Mr. Lambton : in most of them
  Mr. Buddie assisted. This blower is walled off from the mine
  and carried to the surface, where it is discharged with great
  force.    It is made to pass through a leathern pipe, so as to give
  a stream, of which the force was felt at about two feet from the
  aperture in a strong current of air. The common single working
  lamps and double gauze lamps were brought upon this current,
  both in the free atmosphere and in a confined air. The gas fired
  in the lamps in various trials, but did not heat them above dull
  redness, mid when they were brought far into the stream they
  were finally extinguished.

                               modifications of the wire-gauze safety-lamps
  may be seen at the shop of Mr. Coxe, brass founder, in Gateshead, by
  whom they were made.
                                                                    A brass

    A   brass pipe was now fixed upon the blower tube, so as to make
 the whole stream pass through an aperture of less than half an
inch in diameter, which of course formed a most powerful blow
pipe, from which the fire damp, when inflamed, issued with great
violence and        roaring noise, making an intense flame of the
                          a
length of five feet.         The blowpipe was exposed at right angles
to strong wind, and the double gauze lamps and single lamps
     a
successively placed in it.       The double gauze lamps Boon became
red hot at the point of action of the two currents            but the wire ;
did not burn, nor did           communicate explosion.
                                       it                      The single
gauze lamp did not communicate explosion, as long             as   was red       it
hot and slowly moved through the currents; but when                    was            it
fixed at the point of most intense combustion,           reached     weld
                                                                      it             a
ing heat, the iron wire began to burn with sparks, and the explo
 sion then passed.
     In second and third set of experiments on this violent blow
          a
pipe of fire-damp, single lamps, with slips of tin-plate on the out
side or       the inside,- to prevent the free passage of the current,
                 in
 and double lamps, were exposed to all the circumstances of the
 blast, both in the open air and in an engine-house where the
 atmosphere was explosive to           great extent round the pipe, and
                                               a
 through     which   there  was  a strong current of atmospheric air                        ;
 but the heat of the wire never approached near the point at which
 iron wire burns, and the explosion could never be communicated,                                 ,
  The flame of the fire-damp flickered and roared in the lamps, but

   at its greatest intensity of light        -          -      - 25.
   It may be proper to observe, without reference to the supe
riority of light, that coals may be worked nearly twice as cheap
by the wire gauze safe lamp, as by the steel mill.
   The pleasure of seeing the wire gauze safe lamps in general
use amongst the miners, and adding to the security and happi
ness of this useful class of men, amply repays me for the labour
of twelve months devoted to their cause, and for the anxiety
which I have often experienced during the progress of the in?
vestigation.

   P. S. — I  have shown in a paper printed in the Transactions of
the Royal Society, that the power of heated wire-gauze, to permit
the passage of the flame of coal-gas, is directly as the size of the
apertures, and, to a certain extent, as the velocity of the current :
I say to a certain extent, because, by a current of a certain velo
city, flame is extinguished.       A very slight motion will pass the
flame of coal-gas through wire-gauze              having less than 400
apertures to the. square inch, even when it is heated to dull redr
ness ; but a very strong current and an ignition above redness,
visible in day-light, is required to pass the same flame through
wire-gauze having above 700 apertures to the square inch : and
I have never been able to pass the flame of coal -gas or any car
bonaceous flame through wire-gauze having more than 1600
apertures to the square inch, by any means.
   The experiments above detailed on the blower, are the first I
have made upon currents offire-damp.             They prove what I had
inferred from its other properties, and they offer simple mean;
of rendering wire-gauze lamps perfectly safe against all circum
stances, however extraordinary and unexpected, and of
                                                                 placing

        -p.                To    Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, — -L/octor Prichard       confesses that he ascribed to me a
  declaration I had not uttered, and which he never supposed I
  meant to make.      Neither this confession, nor his ingenious at
  tempt, by what   he  calls "synonymous expressions," to extract
  from my words something equivalent to the imputed declaration,
  needs any commentary.        Nor do, I deem it necessary to offer
  more than one or two short observations on the other parts of
 his last communication.
     Although obliged to abandon the exclusion of the whole order
 of testacea from the fifth day's creation, Doctor Prichard still
 considers his coincidences safe, so long as it is not demonstrated
 that the portion of the order which he persists in excluding, en
joyed the power of creeping, or progressive motion. It would seem,
 however, that it was incumbent on him to have proved the want
 of this species of motion in the excluded testacea, before he
 assigned it as the reason of thejr exclusion.     But even the ac
 complishment of this not easy task* would avail him little :
 much less equivocal distinctions than that founded on particular
 modes of motion, preclude testacea from a place in the third
day's creation, in which nothing in the waters, nor any thing
 animate on fhe lapd, is said to have been called into existence.
 It will scarcely be contended that between land and water,
 between animate and inanimate, the distinctions are not infi
 nitely wider and more important,         than between dissimilar
 modes of animal motion.        Nor can it be maintained that the
testacea which the coincidences of Doctor Prichard require to be
 excluded from the fifth, and included in the third day's creation,
 do not bear an incomparably closer analogy to those testacea,
which he is obliged to acknowledge cannot be excluded from the
fifth, day, than they do to the gruss, seed-bearing herbs} and fruit-
 bearing trees of the third day's creation.
     Here I am willing the discussion should close, being content
 to submit to the decision of those who may have attended to its
origin and progress, whether I have exhibited the captious cavil
ling spirit, andother estimable qualities, with which the liberality
of my opponent has endued me. 1 am, sir,

XL1I. On Magnesia- Sulphate of Soda.                      Bij Mr. J. Heales.
          .                    To   Mr. Tillnch.
Sir, —   A communication,            I observe,          has been presented to
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by Dr. Murray, on the analysis
of sea water, the first part of which was read April the 15th,
and the conclusion on the 20th of May last.   It is there shown
by  this excellent chemist, that the brine or mother-liquor   of
sea-water abounds with a salt, which, he says,
                                                  " seems hitherto!
to have escaped observation.     It is a compound of the sulphates
of magnesia and of soda, which together crystallize in very re
gular rhombs, occasionally truncated on some of the edges and
angles ; and this compound salt contains a much smaller quan
tity of water of crystallization than either of the sulphates of
which it is formed ; is less disagreeable to the taste ; differs,
from both in all its other properties; and has not hitherto been
applied to any useful purpose, but may probably form a very ex
cellent purgative salt*."
   This aperient salt has certainly been long in use, although
we find no exact account of its qualities or any description of its
composition published.    It was sold, I am informed, many years
ago under the name of Lyminglon Glauber's salt ; it was then
considered as an adulteration, and therefore brought an inferior
price in the market.     At that time, the true Glauber's salt was
very costly, and chiefly obtained in the process for muriatic
acid ; but the improved methods of preparing the crude muriate
of ammonia have greatly reduced the value, so much so that the
Lymington salt is no longer sold as a substitute for Glauber's, or
the sulphate of soda.
   Whether the extensive works at Lymington furnished this salt
simply by evaporating,the brines, or by mixing the two sulphates
in some certain proportions, I cannot determine ; I have, however,
seen an old prescription for preparing             it,
                                             which consists in mixing
two parts of sulphate of soda with one of the sulphate of magne
sia, and in the usual way proceeding to crystallize the product.
   That this compound salt, which for the present may be called the
inngncsio-sulphate of soda,      the chief ingredient in many of the
                                    is
natural saline aperient springs, and gives the purgative quality to
sea-water,    have scarcely any doubt
              I                           and when its composition
                                               ;
shall have been more attentively examined, we shall probably
find that in every case      will consist of definite proportions of
                               it
its three components, — sulphuric acid and the two bases, viz.
 soda and magnesia.
    The analysis of    mineral water, as Dr. Saunders justly ob
                       a
serves,  had   better be incomplete than inaccurate          and Dr.
                                                                   ;

water, although incomplete, is so far valuable that it describes
the double sulphate as one salt, while all other analytical writers
have stated the quantities of sulphate of soda and that of mag
nesia separately.
      Perhaps the more accurate statement would be to estimate
first, how much of the triple salt exists, and then put down the
quantity of that sulphate, whether of soda or magnesia, which
is in excess.
      In the analysis of the Kilburn water, both by Mr. Bliss and
 Mr. Schmeisser, the two sulphates are estimated as existing se
 parately; which cannot be correct, since in their mixed state
 they possess new and peculiar properties.         These gentlemen do
 not exactly agree in the estimate of the two salts ; this difference
 may however have been occasioned by one of them not making
 his analysis at the same season of the year.
      As the subject is now in such very able hands, we shall probably
 soon be favoured with Dr. Murray's analysis of this very useful
  and commodious purgative salt ; I shall therefore forbear en
 tering upon particulars at this time. Still, however, I must notice
 that it is an article of which I have long had some knowledge, and
 have witnessed its peculiar properties, having had, during the five
  last years of my residence with Mr. Hume of Long Acre, very fre
  quent opportunities of observing many of its habits as a chemical
  composition, and also of its efficacy as a medicine. That a mixture
  of the sulphate of soda with that of magnesia requires less water
   of crystallization, and that the compound salt proves more pur
   gative than either of the two constituents in the same propor
   tion, were, among other remarks, first noticed to me by Mr.
   Hume.       I know he has long ago sold and recommended this
   salt to many of the first professional men in London, and urged
   its being admitted into the pharmacopoeia as a standard remedy.
       This salt, in the proportion of about one ounce or more to a
    gallon of water, forms the best substitute for Cheltenham water.
    There can be no chalybeate property obtained from the true
    Cheltenham water so as to be soluble and useful in the salt re
    maining after evaporation, notwithstanding the plausible and re
    peated advertisements which endeavour to insinuate to the con
    trary; for, the iron or, as it is popularly termed, steel with which
    nature has impregnated many mineral waters is nearly always
    held in solution by carbonic acid; this compound is therefore in
     stantly destroyed by evaporation.      But when the addition of a
     chalybeate   is required, there  are many obvious ways of effecting
     that purpose, of which no medical man can be ignorant, and
     such variation, when made with judgement, must often produce
     the happiest effects.     I am, sir,

                                   To      Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —      In      your Magazine for May, are some remarks by Mr,
 Farey senior, upon what he considers a singular property of vul
 gar fractions, but which upon minute examination will be found
 nothing more than what is deducible from the rules of arithme?
 tical proportion.
    No fractions can be added, without first being reduced to a
 common denominator, and then the numerator is only increased
 in quantity, the denominator remaining as before: but upon
  Mr. V's proviso, both numerator and denominator are indivir
 dually added to the corresponding ones, and that without being
 reduced to a common value ; consequently we must refer to the
 integers which compose the fractions, and not to the fractions
 collectively, for the properties Mr. F. has pointed out,
    Now, if any four numbers be in arithmetical proportion, the
 sum of the means will always be equal the sum of the extremes,
 c. g. If we take the numbers 5, 4, 3, 2, then will 5 + 2 = 4+3:
 or in the numbers 5, 4, 4, 3 (which are still in proportion, though
 the two means are equal, for the difference between the 1 st and 3rd
 is equal to the difference between the 2d and 4th), .*, 5 + 3 =.
 4-1-4 =      4    x 2.      Now,      if   we take the fractions             -i-, ~, —f
 which are a part of           Mr. F's series, it       is evident     5+3 =         4    x 2;

      that America has been peopled by a distinct Race of Men and
      Animals; with some Proofs arising from the Natural History
      and Appearances of the new Continent in favour of the

  w     E observe a regular systematical change in the colotir, shape,
  and features    of men, to the north and the south.           From the
  climate of a fair skin, fine shape and pleasing feature, going to
  the northward, the skin becomes of a blackish brown, the figure
  clumsy, and the features coarse.        Going to the southward, in the
  same manner, we alter the complexion, shape and features, until
  the skin becomes perfectly black, the shape in some countries
  less graceful, and the features' coarse: the colour being altered,
  according to the soil, situation and climate, by the most regular
  and insensible deviations and shades.
      Those facts being considered ; it being also observed, that
  every change is most proper and best adapted to the climate, or
  that it is the natural effect of such climate; there can be no
  moral or physical proposition more certain, than that all those
  people are descended from the same family.
      The philosophers, who discovered several races of men on the
  old continent, have not failed to plant a new and distinct race
  of men in America.       In support of this opinion, they allege that
  the American Indians do not differ from one another in colour,
  like the inhabitants of the other continent       f : their colour also
  is different from that of any other people : that the American
  has no beard ; that he is more frigid, more weak and more
  cowardly than the inhabitants of the old continent.
     This humble and subordinate character of the American sa
  vage has not always been urged as a direct proof that he be
  longs to a separate race of men, for it has occasionally been ad
  vanced in the pride of country ; a species of pride that will not
  suffer children to equal their ancestors; that makes it impossi-
i ble for them to obtain such equality, because there is something
  in America, as they allege, '* that is less favourable to the
  strength and perfection of animal creation."
      The complexion of the American savage, or the sameness of
  colour that is observed among those people, forms the most re
  markable trait in their character.        When we observe, in the old

 continent, all   the varieties of shades, from perfect white to per
 fect black, we are naturally surprised that in the new world,
 which extends to a higher degree of north and south latitude,
 including every habitable region, there should not be a black
 man, nor one, as it has been alleged, who is perfectly white.
 The natives are generally of a reddish brown.           Their colour
 seems   to  be a mixture  of white  and  black, reddened by paint, or
 by the blood appearing through the skin, which is not thick.
 This again receives a brownish cast by more or less exposure to
 the weather.
    On the whole continent of America, there is not a black In
 dian, nor is there a spot for which a black skin is required. No
 winds prevail in America that rise on a hot surface or a sandy
 desert ; nor is there any large tract, within the tropics, that is
 remarkably hot.      The greater part of this continent is divided
 by a long chain of mountains, that extends from north to south.
 These mountains, the highest in the world, have an astonishing
 effect upon the climate, 6n both sides of the continent.     They lie
 across the trade winds, and cut them off ; for they rise above the
 winds.     They are generally distant about seventy or eighty miles
 from the Pacific Ocean, within the tropics ; but the whole space
 between those mountains and the Pacific Ocean is so far from
 being parched by a hot vertical sun, that the inhabitants enjoy
 the most pleasing temperature.        There is a sandy desert, nearly
 one hundred miles in extent, between Sachara and Lima, about
 the seventh degree of south latitude.         Such an expanse of dry
 sand, under a vertical sun, in any part of the other continent,
 would produce great heat, and give a sable colouring to the peo
 ple in its vicinity.   But in the province of Lima it can produce
 no such effect, because the wind in those regions ought to blow
from the east ; but there are mountains in that direction, at no
great distance, covered with perpetual snow.
    The trade winds to the eastward of the Andes are checked by
 those mountains ; there they deposit all the water with which
they had been charged.          The quantity of rain in that region
being great, the process of evaporation must also be great,
whereby the heat of the atmosphere is moderated.            A reddish
brown, with a tawny cast, is the darkest colour that can be ex
 pected in such a climate.      America, on both sides of the Andes,
 above the tropics, should produce, as in some parts of the ol<l
continent, in similar latitudes, a brown or dusky race of men, until
we reach a high degree of latitude ; and it is very questionable,
whether a race of men, perfectly fair, will ever be found to pre
serve that complexion for many ages, in any part of America,
to the eastward of the Cordilleras ; except in high latitudes, and
                                                                 near

near the coast.       There are not any people, on the old continent,
perfectly fair, except those who live in high latitudes, where tha
westerly winds come from the sea, at no great distance, so tem
pered as not to be very sharp nor very dry.           This rule applies
to Great     Britain  and  Ireland,   to the Germans, Danes, Swedes,
and Circassians *; hut going to the eastward in the same lati
tude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more
dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun
dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour ; it ceases to be
perfectly fair.      There is not, in the eastern part of Asia, be
tween the extremes of heat and cold, a nation perfectly fair.
The best complexions are found near the head of the Ganges,
among the mountains of Thibet.               We may discover a concur
 rence of circumstances, in the British isles, and near the German
Ocean, not found in many other places, which are necessary to
 a fair skin.     They are little exposed to the warm sun ; they
 have little intense cold, and their winds usually come from a
 watery surface. Their westerly winds arc from the ocean, and
 their atmosphere is loaded with moisture.          They have not much
 fain, but their showers are of long continuance; they have much
 dark cloudy weather, and the rays of the sun are feeble when he
 visits the inhabitants.        They never experience that warm clear
 sun, which, freckles or tans the skin ; nor those long intense
 colds, which injure the cutaneous nerves, and produce a reddish
 brown.      While America remained a great forest, inhabited by
 savages, under the constant dominion of westerly winds, there
  was not any climate on the eastern coast in which we could
  expect a fair skin.      By the progress of cultivation, the general
  course of the winds is materially affected in the middle and
  northern states ; and in the process of time we may expect such
  a prevalence of easterly winds, near the coast, in those states, as
  shall prevent that tendency of complexion to the clear brunet,
  which prevails in temperate climates, in other parts of the
  world.
      Although no part of America is fitted to the production of a
  black skin, nor would many parts of this continent be expected
  to produce a skin perfectly fair, among the original inhabitants ;
  we are not to believe, as some writers have alleged,- that the
  American Indians are all of one colour.           Their skin is tinged
  with a variety of shades between white and black ; but there are
   Indians, as we are told, above the latitude of 45 degrees north,
  who are nearly white ; and there are Indians in Guiana and
  Brazil, at a distance from the coast, whose skins are very dark.

   208                 On the peopling     of America.
  I  was informed by the     Little Turtle, who is     a  chief of the Miaitn
  tribe of the lakes, and      has  an extensive acquaintance with the
  Indians, that the northern Indians are much fairer than those
  who live in warm climates ; except that Indians, who live near
  the lakes, and are much exposed to the sun, in fishing and
  swimming, have darker -skins than other northern Indians.                  He
  understands that Indians who live northward from the sources
  of the Mississippi, are fairer than those of his own nation who
  live in the opposite direction.
      The Indians at Matagrassa, as we are told by Condamine, are
  of different shades, according to the elevation of the country,
  some of them being almost fair *.           The testimony of Molina is
  also very explicit on this subject.       '* The natives of Chili form
  but one nation, that is divided into various tribes, who have a
  similar physiognomy, and speak the same tongue, which may be
  called the Chilese language.         It is soft, harmonious, regular,
  and abounding in words that in all cases are fit to express not
  only physical but moral and abstract ideas.              Those people are
 of a brown coppery colour ; but the Boroani, who are situated
 in the centre of the province of Arauco, in the thirty-ninth de
 gree of south latitude, are white and red, with blue eyes and
 fair hair, like the Europeans. who are born in the middle of the
 northern temperate zone.          Their features are regular, and some
 of them are beautiful f."
     When South-America shall be well cultivated, the timber cut
j^vn, the quantity of rain diminished, stagnant pools dried, and-
 the rivers contained within their proper banks, the easterly
 winds being checked by the warmer surface of cultivated lands,
 a dusky race of men, nearly black, are to be expected in Brazil,
 about the latitude of Cape St. Roque ; for that is the only part
of America in which the progress of industry may darken the
 skin, notwithstanding the effects of civilization.
     As no proof can be given, that the American Indians are a
new race of men, I shall consider the other trite allegation, that
 ct animal nature
                     degenerates     in America.'"      This opinion, ad
vanced by the eloquent Buffon, and supported by many argu
ments, has also been repeated by Dr. Robertson, the Abbe'Rav-
nal, and by other writers.         The most remarkable appearance is
that " all animals in America, including those who have been
naturalized to the climate, are commonly inferior in size to those
of the old continent.        Nature appears, in that new world, to
have finished her works upon a smaller scale.                           , ,.

 and other physical causes, in this new world, something that is
 opposed to the amplification of animated nature.              There are
 some obstacles to the development and perhaps to the formation
 of great germs.
     " Although the savage of America is nearly of the same sta
 ture with men in the other continent, this is not a sufficient ex
 ception to the general contraction of animated nature through
 that whole continent.       The American savage             has no hair,
 no beard, no ardour for his female.          Though nimbler than the
 European, because he is more accustomed to running, his
strength is not so great.         His sensations are less acute, but he
is at the same time more timid and cowardly.              He is without
 vivacity  or enterprise *,"
     " America gives birth to no creature of such bulk as to be
compared with the elephant or rhinoceros, nor that equals the
 lion or tiger iu strength and ferocity. The same qualities, in
 the climate of America, which stinted the growth and enfeebled
 the spirit cf its native animals, have proved pernicious to such
 as have migrated into it voluntarily, from the old continent, or
have been transported hither by the Europeans.
     " Most of the domestic animals with which the Europeans
stored the provinces when they settled there, have degenerated
with respect to bulk and quality, in a country whose tempera
ture and soil seem to be less favourable to the strength and per
fection of animal creation f."
     The whole of this description is poetical and imaginary; for
it has no foundation in nature.          It is not from any vice in the
climate, nor the want of proper food, but from the happy state
of our country, from the general ease with which men have sup
ported themselves in America, that domestic animals have been
supposed to degenerate.         Nothing less than necessity has ever
produced diligence in any kingdom or state.            The man who has
little to do, acquires habits of idleness, and he does less.          In
Europe, where the means of living are difficult, pasturage scarce
and forage dear, the farmer is restrained in the number of his
cattle ; for this reason the cattle he keeps are attended with
great care. They are duly housed and fed ; the largest and
best are preserved for breed, and every thing is done by which
the size may be increased, and the value enhanced of the few
 he has for sale.     The forest, in America, supplied the stock with
 pasture during the summer, and during the winter, in some of
 the colonies, when they were first settled.         In the northern co-
ionies,   the  cattle  were   fed  in  winter,  but   they were seldom

  "housed.     Hence it follows, that they were shrivelled and di
   minished, by cold storms, hail and snow, as the human species
   have been diminished in Lapland and Siberia.              In addition to
   those diminishing causes, the first colonists, in most cases, were
   inattentive to the size of the male or female from which their
   cattle were to spring.       We have a remarkable instance, in the
   Chickesaw nation, of the bad effects of breeding from diminutive
   parents.     Those Indians were originally furnished by De Soto
   with   a  breed   of Spanish horses*. In that country the horses
   provided for themselves, the soil being good and the climate
   warm.      The Indians, towards the middle of the last century,
   discovered that their horses were a valuable article of commerce ;
  they could be exchanged for guns, blankets, and other neces
  saries ; but the traders, in all cases, bought the largest horses,
   and the .smallest were left to continue the breed.          The effect is
  obvious, for the Chickesaw horses          are confessedly smaller than
  they were fifty years ago.        Other causes, sufficiently numerous,
  may be given of quadrupeds degenerating in America, under the
  shrivelling hand of indolence and neglect ; but it would not fol
  low, from a thousand such examples, that America cannot pro
  duce a race of animals large and vigorous as similar animals in
  the old continent.        I do not say that America has produced
 greater or stronger animals than ever were seen on the opposite
  part of the globe, but we know that bones have been found,
  both in North and South America, of sundry animals, granivorous
  and carnivorous, that were greatly superior in size to the ele
 phant, the lion, or any other beast now living in the old conti
 nent. Although the beast, whose bones and claws were latelv
  found in Green-Brier, in Virginiaf, must have been a carnivorous
  animal, and greatly superior to the lion in strength, we cannot
  affirm that he was equally fierce ; for it is admitted, that lions
 .who are found near mount Atlas are neither so fierce nor strong
  as those which are nourished on the burning deserts of Nigritia.
  From this we infer, that extreme heat conduces to the ferocity
  of beasts of prey, and that animals of the carnivorous kind are
 less ferocious in America than in the hotter regions of the other
  continent.      With respect to our domestic animals, whose parents
  have been imported from Europe, we should not boast in our
.turn, by saying that the present race is larger or stronger than
  those who were imported ; but we may affirm, without danger
  of being refuted, that there are numerous instances of cattle,
  lately raised in the United States, full as large as any of the same
 kind in Europe.        If it should be alleged that animals frequently

   Improve under the influence of our happy soil and climate, we
   might quote an author of great reputation, who lived in Europe,
   in favour of that position*.     Speaking of Chili in South Ame
   rica, he says,  " The animals of our hemisphere not only multi
   ply, but improve in this delightful region.       The horned cattle
   are of a larger size than those of- Spain.     Its breed of horses
   surpass, both in beauty and spirit, the famous Anrlalusian race
   from which they sprang."
       Does the human race degenerate in America ?        We are much
   interested in this question, whatever the fate of quadrupeds may
   be.    The want of beard, in the American savage, has commonly
  been mentioned as a proof that he is of an inferior race of ani
  mals ; or that he is greatly degenerated.     " The beardless coun
  tenance and smooth skin of the American seem to indicate a de
  fect of vigour, occasioned by some vice ill' his frame.         He is
  destitute of one sign of manhood and strength f."            From the
   Indian's supposed want of beard, philosophers seem to have in
  ferred his want of strength, courage, and affection for the other
  sex.    The Indians, like the Tartars and other Asiatics from whom
  they are chiefly descended, have thin beards ; but writers who
  urge their want of beard, in proof that they are a new race of
  men, tlo not consider that there are numerous tribes or nations in
  the eastern parts of the old continent, who, like the Indians,
  appear to be without any beard.       They constantly pluck it out.
  The islanders in the South Sea have beards, as we are toid by
  Captain Cook ; but many of them pluck it out, or the greater
  part ofit,   as well as the hair from under their arms.      Whoever
 .takes the trouble to make himself acquainted with the subject,
 must think    it strange that an opinion destitute of truth, without
  other foundation than distant and hasty observation, should have
 obtained so general a credit in Europe.       At      meeting of In

 Chickesaw, the Cherokee, the Creek, the Chipawa, and the
 Shawanese nations.       Their beards in general were shaved, but
 some of the chiefs had suffered whiskers to remain on the upper
 lip, or they suffered    a small portion on the chin to grow to          a
'considerable length     |. One of the Shawanese chiefs had strong
 whiskers up'on his upper lip, and so had          aChickesaw and         a

been regarded as an inferior, beardless race of men, it is not im
probable that the custom of wearing whiskers, such as we have
observed, by some of their chiefs, may have originated in pride ;
or it may be considered as a mark of seniority and rank. A dark
skin does not show the beard when shaved, but whiskers are very
conspicuous.         The habit of shaving is modern among the In
dians, and such is probably the use of whiskers, for the ancient
custom was to pluck out the beard.               It was pulled out by the
finger nails,     as some   of them   allege,  and others of them describe
other modes by which it was extirpated.               The tedious hours of
an idle savage, sitting on the ground more than half his time ;
without work, without books, without converse, and almost
without thought, must have been relieved by the frequent and
trifling exercise of plucking the beard. And it is not improbable
that the desire of some employment, which required little mo
tion, and little exertion of the mind, gave rise to that other ab
surd, but very common practice among savages, tatooing, or
marking the skin by various paints and figures. It appears
 strange, at first sight, that a custom so unnatural as pricking
 the skin, and marking it with different paints, should prevail
 among the savage nations in Africa and Asia, in the South Seas
 and in America.         The Arabs mark their lips, as well as the arms
and body,     with   blue paint*. Customs like these, which originated
in whim, or rather in the desire of relieving tedious hours by
 some employment, produce a considerable change in the exter
nal form: aud that adventitious form is soon regarded as a cri
 terion of beauty; it becomes general in the nation. The Indians,
 like the Tartars, frequently cut the hair from the greater part
 of their head. This custom was prior to the use of scissars
 among them.          Some old Indians whom I consulted on this sub
ject, allege that their, ancestors, not having sharp instruments,
 had recourse to fire, such is their tradition, for removing the
 hair.     They singed it off with a live coal of hickory, or some
 other hard wood.          Those observations on the subject of beards,
 perfectly agree      with  the testimony of other, people.     I have been
 assured by traders and gentlemen who have conversed much with
 the Indians, and lived among them on terms of the utmost
 familiarity, that Indians, in all cases, have hair, exactly as
 white people have it; without any difference, except that it is
  thinner. As their taste begins to change, from their acquaintance
  with white people, they are less solicitous at present to extir
 pate those hairs which are not supposed, as formerly, to mar the
  beauty.

    We know that women among the American Indians, are
 forced to perform all the hard labour that is necessary to the
 support of a family.    The husband smokes his pipe, or sleeps in
 his cabin, while his wife hoes the corn, with a child at her back.
 By this mark of apathy, or unkindness to his female, the Ame
 rican savage is supposed to be distinguished from other men.
 " Marriage itself, instead of being an union of affection and in
 terest between equals, becomes among them the unnatural con
junction of a master with his slave*/'         The author of this re
 mark was not unacquainted with the manners of rude nations in
 the old continent; and if he had sought for a satisfactory proof,
 that men are all of the same family, and that the disposition is
 not changed by an extraordinary chauge of climate, he would
have found such a proof in the conduct of the American savage
 to his female.
    There is no living creature on the old continent, bird or beast,
that is so much distinguished as man, in his uncultivated state,
by the want of kindness to his female companion.             The male
bird is most assiduous in helping his mate to feed their young.
Some males among the beasts, when their assistanoe is not
wanted, neglect their female ; but none of them adds to her
trouble, or treats her with cruelty.      Man alone is distinguished
by the wane of kindness, and by cruelty to his female.         Perhaps
Russia may be the only country in which the tyranny of a hus
band is reduced to a system, and avowed in the marriage cere
mony; but Russia is not the only part of the old continent in
which the wife is a slave to her husband.            The Arabian does
not suffer his wife to eat with him ; he would, -as he conceives,
be degraded by her company; but he compels her to bring wood
and water, to dress his victuals, and to perform every other me
nial service.   His sons are taught to despise their mother. She
is not suffered to eat with them after they are eight or ten years
cjd. In that ancient nation, we see the character of men, who
are not perfectly civilized, as it may be traced through all shades
and colours, in the old continent, or the islands connected with
it. In many of the nations in Euripe, who presume to call other
men savages, the weak and humble wife continues to suffer un
der the chastisement of a master.         We have reason to believe
that man is the greatest tyrant upon earth.        His strength is the
measure of his conduct.     The little despot  in  his family, and the
great despot on his throne, exhibit the same character.          Those
who are weaker may expect to smart beneath the arm of power.

 part, must    be improved by the progress    of knowledge.   We soon
 discover that all permanent happiness depends on sentiment and
 reflection.     The consciousness of giving protection and comfort
 to those who place themselves under our care : to those who are
 weaker and need our assistance, is the solace and reward of
 men who feel and reason ; it is the source of their greatest hap
 piness.     The pleasure that arises from domestic attachments,
 from the constant exercise of kindness to a wife and chil
 dren, cannot be equalled by all the other enjoyments in life.
 The greater part of our species, in the old world, have not dis
 covered this truth.      Idle and indolent, governed by passion and
 not by reason, they remain inexorable tyrants.          If a separate
 race of men had been formed for America, in which animals are
 said to be less fierce, or less savage, it is probable that the man
 of America would have been less cruel to his female than the
tyrant of the old world ; but his manners, on this head, give an
 additional proof that he is of the old family-
    After stating the great resemblance that is found between the"
 American savage and his savage brother in other parts of the
 world, it can hardly be necessary to give many other proofs that
they are too much alike.        The American Indians are described
as men who are passionately fond of strong drink. On this head
they perfectly resemble the savage and half savage of the old
continent.       The Tartar gets drunk with fermented mare's milk ;
the Mahometan, with opium and the smoke of tobacco : the an
cient Scythians intoxicated themselves with the fumes of hemp-
seed : the Celtic and Teutonic nations, with ale and mead : the
African gets drunk with brandy.          We say nothing of the modern
nations that are more civilized, who, to the reproach of ration
ality, seem to have a pleasure in resembling beasts. Weary of
decent deportment, and fatigued with the trouble of thinking',
they deliberately sit down to deprive themselves of reason.       The
American savage is equally attached to drinking and gambling
with his European brother.
    The nations of America have been represented as "men of little
strength ; but as they are known to be at least equal in size to
those of the other continent, they may also be presumed to be
their equals in strength, when they are fed in the same manner,
and equally accustomed to labour.          Such of them as have been
employed,      from  Nantucket,   in whaling, can hardly be matched
at an oar.      Activity, combined with strength, renders them ex
cellent seamen.
    The courage of the American savage has been mentioned,
like his other qualities, in terms of reproach ; he is said to be

The Indians make war by stratagem, but they are not therefore
to be deemed cowards.          They are not very numerous, for which
reason they  are  not prodigal of life.       The point of honour witlj
an Indian chief, does not consist in facing his enemy in the field,
but in saving his own men.          Such is the dictate of prudence.
The Spartan youth were trained to all kinds of stealth and stra
tagem, that they might the better be enabled to surprise an
enemy; but the Spartans were among the bravest of men. When
it became proper or necessary to face an enemy, they never
turned their backs.     It is admitted that Indians have shown the
most astonishing degree of fortitude in bearing torture.            This
has been called passive courage ; but the same men are supposed
to be deficient in active courage ; and this strange conjecture is
founded on their art of war, which differs from that of Euro
peans.    The Indian secures himself in battle by a tree or some
other cover.    If a cover be a mark of cowardice, our ancestors,
who fought in armour, were deficient in active courage, and so
are the moderns, who avail themselves of trenches or any other
species of fortification.      The object of an Indian chief is to de
stroy his enemy,   with  as  little loss to himself as possible. Having
this object in view, he avails himself of the best means in his
power ; nor is he afraid of reproach, while he adheres to his
purpose.    We have seen instances, too many, of brainless white
commanders, who have sacrificed half of their men in fruitless
and hopeless actions, only because they feared lest they should
be suspected of the want of courage. The virtues of Fabius were
not less admired, when he patiently endured the insults of             aji
enemv, than when he met that enemv in the field.            Men are less
afraid of reproach, when they are conscious of not deserving it.
In whatever manner the Indians may think fit to meet an enemy,
they give unquestionable proofs that they are not afraid of death.
Surrounded    in   a block-house, without ammunition,            we have     ,
known them perish in the flames, because they would not sur
render and become prisoners. When        I     say that the Indian mode
of fighting, under cover,    is    the dictate of policy, not of fear,I
am prepared to give instances, not        a     few, in which they have
shown proofs of undaunted courage in the open field, when the
other mode of fighting could not be adopted.           It   isfound that
our woodsmen are rather an overmatch for the Indians, in cor

natives appeared contemptible and dastardly, from their want of
arms.   A   white man to an Indian was then a giant to           pygmy,;

 216                  On the peopling of America.
    By a general view of the human race and its varieties on the
 old continent, and by comparing those people with the original
 inhabitants of America, we must be convinced that men are all
 descended from the same stock, and that America was peopled
from the other continent ; but we have ho information concern*
 ing the time in which the first colonists were transported. The
great extent of population in America, when Columbus made
 his discoveries, about three hundred years ago, is a sufficient
proof that many years had elapsed since the aborigines had come
 to this continent ; but the modern date of the largest and most
populous empires then existing in America, has been supposed
to justify a belief, that the first settlement of America was re
 cent, when compared with that of the other continent.         At the
period to which I refer, America was settled in all directions,
 ffom north to south, although no part of it was fully peopled ;
nor had any progress been made in those arts which are the fruit
of necessity in old and numerous societies. Those circumstances,
however, can neither be urged in proof of a very ancient nor a
very recent settlement.       Migrations, in the old continent, have
lately  been  the  effect of a crowded population ; but migrations
in America sprang from a different cause. The first adventurers,
who were little attached to their native soil, could hardly be at
tached to a particular part of the land they had discovered. Sus
taining themselves without labour, in a country that abounded
in game, they acquired habits of idleness.      When the game be
came scarce in one part, they removed to another.          The same
spirit produces the same effects, among the present      white  inhar
hitants of North America.        The more adventurous, more fickle,
or more indolent, move to the frontiers, and settle upon new
lands.    When the range is impaired, or the game diminished,
those very men, or their children, move onward, and follow the
range ; for they raise little corn, eating flesh instead of bread ;
whence their habits, of idleness become inveterate. As the ocean
yields a supply of food, that is more easily caught than birds or
beasts, it follows that the sea coast was first explored ; but the
greater number of inhabitants were found in warm or temperate
climates ; because in such climates the means of subsistence
were easy. In this manner every part of America may have been
visited, and sparse settlements formed, within a few centuries
after it was first discovered. In this manner too, as we are taught
by civil history, the other continent was originally settled.     The
first migrations were not the effect of a crowded population ; they
were caused by a rambling or adventurous temper. Every country
was first visited by single families, or by small parties, who mi
grated in the spirit of ambition, discontent or caprice, from young
colonies or new governments.        We have the names of men oh.

 the other continent, who were celebrated as the founders of go
 vernment ; but those men, in every case, appear to have found a
 weak, unconnected race of savages, scattered over the country in
 Which they fixed their empire.       They certainly did not migrate
 from a crowded hive, whoever they may have been. When the
 small tribes, who first settled in America, had destroyed the game
 in one place, they removed to another without difficulty or oppo
 sition ; but in the process of time, migrations were not effected
 without trouble, for all the country was claimed as hunting ground
 by one tribe or another.     In that case hostilities commenced,
 and men were destroyed, that bears and buffaloes might have
 room to breed. The failure of game caused the Indians, in some
 cases, to turn their attention to agriculture : and it appears that
 successful chiefs, in the usual spirit of domination, in some cases
 extended their authority, by adding weaker tribes to their respec
 tive empires. In this manner, the monarchsof Peru and Mexico
 were extending their domains when the Spaniards visited this
 continent; and in this manner the greatest empires formerly
sprang up in the other hemisphere.         But Mexico and Peru mav
 have been well peopled, many a century before there was a mo
 narch in either of those countries.
     It has been observed that the American savage, passing over
 the shepherd state, was turning his attention, in some instances,
to the cultivation of the soil.      From this circumstance it has
been alleged that he differs greatly from the man of the other
 continent ; but this inference is not correctly deduced, for it is
known that the introduction of new arts and customs is frequently
 to be ascribed to what is called pure accident.      The casual dis
covery    of  gunpowder  in Europe gave     rise to a variety of new
customs and to the neglect of old ones. The introduction or
discovery of a grain, that was easily cultivated, mav have pro
moted agriculture; or the want of the most useful domestic ani
mals may have caused the employment of a shepherd to be for
gotten.      The use of cow--, sheep, aud goats was known to the
first family upon the other continent ; and that family was also
instructed in the art of cultivating the earth.       The first emi
grants from the original stock were equally instructed in the se
veral arts of tilling the earth, tending cattle, and killing game;
but as men always prefer the most easy mode of living, they would
support themselves, for many years, by hunting alone ; for in new
countries, where there is any winter, a family is most easily sup
ported by himting and fishing.       When the game failed, they had
recourse, in every case, to the other most easy mode of living,
to the care of cattle ; for the colonists, who were never separated
from the parent state by an ocean, could easily obtain a supply
qf cattle when they needed them.          In the progress of popula

   218                  Oh the peopling       of America.
  tion, when pasture failed for cattie, they .had recourse to agrit
  culture.       Thus it was that the shepherd state commonly suc
  ceeded the chase, and that again was succeeded by. agriculture.
  This succession did not, for it could not, take place in America,
  The first planters brought with them the usual stock of knowledge,
  but they brought no cattle.             They brought the maize*, as I
  presume, that we call Indian corn, for it is said to grow in Asia.
  If   they wished to raise cattle, they could not obtain the species
  to which they had been accustomed, but they could raise corn,
  for they had the seed : hence it was, that in all cases some de
  gree of agriculture immediately followed the habit of living by
  the cltase.
      The annals of the American savage, like those of every other
  nation, have been corroded by the rust of time. When we speak
  of the epoch in which they arrived, we find ourselves travelling
  in the regions of conjecture, having few marks, and those very
  obscure, to direct our course.           We discover nothing that may
  be deemed certain, except that they came, the greater part of
  them, from Asia, and that the time of their arrival is very
  distant.
      While it was presumed that America was separated from the
  other continent by an ocean of considerable extent, various opi
  nions were formed respecting the manner in which this continent
  had been peopled; for the ancestor of an American savage, in
  his canoe, could not be supposed to have adventured far upon
  the ocean ; but the discoveries of late navigators have removed
  all difficulties on that head.        We learn from Captain Cook and
     * Although maize and tobacco are both commonly supposed to have ori
  ginated in America, there is much reason to believe that both thine plants
  were carried from Asia by the original emigrants.        I suspect that the Es
  quimaux Indians, when first discovered, bad not the use of maize ; for their
  ancestors came from a part of the other continent in which that grain is
' pot cultivated, but it is cultivated in Asia.     "The inhabitants," says La-
  billardiere, "sold us ears of maize, still green, which had been boiled."
  This was in one of the Molucca islands. Tobacco, as we are told, is cul
  tivated by the natives in the vicinity of Nootka Sound.      But tobacco is a
  tropic il plant. The seed must have been imported from Asia.           The Chi
  nese, who seldom change their habits, have long been smokers of tobacto.
  Certain nations in India, beyond the Ganges, are slaves to the use of this
  nauseous plant. The inhabitants of the island Sagaleen, about the 49th
  degree of latitude, are also perpetual smokers of tobacco.         We are told
  by La Perouse, that "they have good large-leafed tobacco, and the pipe
  is never out of their mouths."      They are supposed to purchase their to
  bacco from the Tartars.       It has also been observed, that the Tartars on
  the continent, nearly opposite to that island, are enslaved by the use of
  tobacco.     " Every male of them, young and old, wears a leathern girdle,
  to  which   are hung a little pouch for tobacco, and a pipe."    It is not to be
  supposed that all those nations, so distant and lately discovered, imported
  their tobacco, or its seed, within the last three hundred years, from America.
                                                                          others,

   It has also been discovered, that all the little islands between
  the northern parts of Asia and America are inhabited by savages,
  who must have wandered from Asia ; and it is not to be supposed
  that a similar race of men did not travel to America. In a word,
  the descent of the North-American Indians, or the greater num
  ber of them, from Asiatic Tartars, or their progenitors, is now
  so fully established, that I shall not exercise the reader's pa
  tience, in showing how much they resemble one another in their
 features, their scantiness of beard, or their language : but the
 Tartar did not transport his horse, and the want of that animal
  has caused many shades of difference in their habits.
      In stating that the aborigines of North-America are chiefH-
  descended from the Tartars, or from the same stock with the
  Tartars, I am supported by common tradition               f among those
  people,    as  well  as by the obvious    facility of the passage.     But
  some of the northern Indians, as I suspect, emigrated from.
  Europe.       It can hardly be questioned that the Esquimaux In
  dians are the diminutive sprouts of Norwegian ancestors.               It is
 fully ascertained, that colonies from Norway settled in Iceland
  and Greenland near one thousand years ago ; but the first ad-,
 venturers who are mentioned in history, found a race of savages
  who had preceded them.
      The same adventurers who discovered Iceland, at the period
 to which I refer, extended their travels to the Labrador coast,
 where they found a race of savages, who appeai sJ also, by their
 language, to have emigrated from Denmark or Norway.                  When,
 we consider the       distance of  Iceland, Greenland, and the Labra
 dor coast, from the British isles, or the northern parts of the
 continent, the difficulty and- danger of navigating the northern
 ocean, in high latitudes, and the contemptible vessels now in use
 among the Esquimaux, it may appear strange that every island,
 and every spot of land in those inhospitable regions, should have
 been discovered and settled at the time to which I have referred.
 This phaenomenon is best accounted for by recollecting that there
 must have been a time in which the northern ocean was navi
 gated with less danger than at present ; when Iceland, Green
 land, and the Labrador coast were much more hospitable, the
 soil more productive, and the climate more temperate than they
 are at present. This allegation may appear somewhat paradoxi
cal, when it is compared with a former observation, that the
winter's cold has been gradually decreasing for more than' 2000

  years, in the greater part of the world.           The fact, however, Is
  not to be disputed. The natives of Labrador, from their want of
  letters, can give us no account of the change that has taken
  place in that country; but the case is very different in Iceland.
  The inhabitants of that island have preserved their history for
 nine or ten centuries, and the change of climate there has been
 fully established.       I do not say that the numerous population of
  Iceland, near one thousand years ago, or the flourishing state
  of arts and sciences among those people, at so distant a period,
  is to be taken for a proof that the climate was formerly more
  temperate, and the soil more productive than at present, al-
  though they add great probability to this opinion ; but we find
  an argument in the natural history of the island, that seems to
  be absolutely conclusive.       It is not to be disputed, that in former
 ages   Iceland    produced   timber   in abundance *.      Large, trees are-
 occasionally     found    there, in  the   marshes   or  valleys, that have
 been covered to a considerable depth in the ground.                Segments
 of those fossil trees have lately been exported from the island, in
 proof of the fact alleged.          But we are equally certain,, that in
the present age timber does not thrive in the island.              Its growth
 is prevented, or the plants are destroyed by the intensity of the
winter's cold, as in the northern extremities of Asia and America,,
 where nothing but shrubs is to be found.             The same pejoration

 have certainly taken place on the Labrador coast that have been
 observed in Iceland.
     This remarkable increase of cold in high northern latitudes
may be accounted for by reference to a general deluge, the flood
of Noah. I am aware that allegations, in natural or civil his-,
tory, are not to be supported by referring to a book whose au
thority is disputed ; but in the present case I must be permit
ted to allege the certainty of a general deluge, provided it will
 account for the several phaenomena, and provided those phaeno-
 mena cannot otherwise be accounted for.
    Upon the supposition of a general deluge, it will be admitted
that immediately after the flood there could be no ice in any part
of the ocean. The waters in the northern regions were exactly
of the same temperature as the waters in other parts of the ocean,
for they had the same origin. The fountains of the great deep
    * It is asserted in the ancient Icelandic records, that when Ingulf, the
Norwegian, first landed in Iceland, anno 879, he found so thick a growth
ot birch-trees, that he penetrated them with difficulty.    Some modtrn his
torians, knowing that no trees of any kind grow at present in that island,
have expressed their fears lest the veracity of the ancient annalists should
te suspected.      If they had known that trunks of trees have lately been
found in that island, buried several feet deep in the earth, their fears would
have been obviated.
                                                                         were

Were broken up.         The temperature was thirty or forty degrees
above the freezing point.           In that case, the air in Iceland, or
upon     the Labrador   coast,   'coming from the temperate surface of
the ocean, was temperate and pleasant. Vegetation in the long
days of summer was vigorous, and the winter was not sufficiently
cold to destroy perennial plants. In the proceRS of time the waters
near the pole lost a great part of their heat, and ice was formed
in the creeks and bays. Large cakes of ice were occasionally
broken oft" by storms, and detached from the shore.              As the tem
perature     of the ocean   decreased,     some    part  of  the  broken ice
continued to float through the         summer.       Every succeeding year
added to the size of the floating masses*.             They were increased
by rain, by snow, and by the spray of the sea.                 The northern
ocean is nearly filled at present by those floating islands of
durable ice.       The summer winds that reach the coast, instead
of being tempered, as formerly, by a watery surface, are now
chilled by mountains of ice ; and they are become so intensely
cold in winter, as to be destructive of animal and vegetable life.
     It may possibly be alleged, that in the space of three thousand
 years, the time that passed between the flood and Ingulf s arrival
 in Iceland, the atmosphere should have been as cold, and the
accumulation of ice as great in the northern ocean as they are
at present. It is readily admitted, that when we consider the
 present degree of cold which prevails in high latitudes, we con
 clude that a few years would be sufficient to produce vast bodies
 of ice. But we are to consider, that in the case referred to, the
 water in every part of the ocean was tepid, and the whole face
of the earth was of the same temperature with the water ; whence
 it followed, that the atmosphere could not be cold, nor could
 there be ice or snow in the longest nights of winter.                We have
 no data by which we may compute the number of years or ages
 that were necessary to abstract so great a body of heat as then
 existed in the northern lands and ocean ; but a long period must
 have been required, for there is no fact in natural history more
 certain than that there was more heat, or less cold, in high
 northern latitudes, in the eighth or ninth century, than there is
    * U is a curious faat, and in perfect coincidence with this theory, that
 when the first Norwegian colony settled in Greenland, about one thousand
 years ago, they found no difficulty in approaching the coast, and a regular
 correspondence was supported with those people for many years.            That
 intercourse was entirely neglected during the dark ages of anarchy and
 misrule in Europe.    Since the revival of learning, within the two last cen
 turies, sundry attempts have been made to discover the remains of that co
 lony, who lived on the eastern part of Greenland: hut no landing can novtr
  be effected on that coast, by reason of the vast bodies of ice with which it
 is pressed. From this it is clear, that within the last seven or eight hundred
 years there has been a great increase of ice in high northern latitudes.

      at present ; nor is it clear that the heat of the air, earth, or water,
      in those high latitudes, has yet attained its lowest degree*.
         By keeping in mind that there has been a time in which the
      climate was temperate, and the soil, for the tame reason, was
      productive in high northern latitudes, we are enabled to account
      for mam' phsenomena which had appeared very enigmatical.           We
      are no longer surprised that any part of our species should have
      migrated and settled themselves willingly in Lapland and other
      regions near the arctic circle ; in regions from which nature, in
      the present age, seems to shrink with horror.       Those countries,
      as we conceive, were all of them settled while the climate was
      temperate and the soil- fit for cultivation.    As the miseries that
      are caused by cold weather and a frozen soil increased, the ha
      bits and constitutions of the inhabitants suffered a considerable
     change, and they became attached to the land of their ancestors.
     They now live, or seem to live, contented, in a country to which
      criminals are banished as one of the severest punishments.
         By attending to' the above-stated changes in soil and climate
      in high northern latitudes, we can easily discover how it should
     have happened that Norway contained a crowded population
      above one thousand years ago, and sent out colonies.
         By attending to that change of climate in high latitudes, we
     can easily account for incidents that have excited general atten
      tion twelve or fifteen hundred years ago.        We discover'Tiow it
      happened   that certain   countries, which  at present are not very
     desirable nor productive, had formerly been the officina gentium,
..   the very nursery of nations ; and why, in the process of time, it
     became necessary for those very people to migrate by thousands
     in quest of better habitations.

that by the injection of two drachms of muriatic acid diluted
with eight ounces of water, heated to about 100°, every day, the
whole of it has been removed, and that in eleven days. The
acid during almost the whole period came away nearly neutral.

necessary.

XLVI. Extract       from   a Memoir read to the Institute on the
    \Zth of May 1S1G, on the Possibility of making the Molluscce
   of Fresh IVate>- Hue in Salt IValer, and vice versa. By
   F. S. Beudant*.
The     experiments which form the object of this memoir havp
been undertaken chiefly with a view to account for some re
markable geological circumstances, and particularly for the
mixture of sea- and fresh-water shells in the same rock, which
 M. Beudant discovered in 1S08, at Beauchamp near Pierrelave,
in the department of the Seine and Oise, and more recently in
the valley of Vaucluse.
              Experiments    on  Fresh-water Molluscce.
   Towards the end of summer 1S0S,                 M. Beudant first at*
tempted    to  convey suddenly fresh-water mollusca? into water
charged with 0'04 parts of muriate of ,soda, as sea-water ge
nerally is. These animals could not withstand the change ; for
their shells contracted, and they died in a few seconds.                 The
bivalve molluscs merely resisted the salt-water a little longer, in
consequence of shutting their shells : in a few days, however, they
died also.
   Being desirous of accounting for the almost total absence of
fossil shells in the beds of gypsum, M. Beudant tried the action
of water charged with sulphate of lime on the molluscje ; and
with this view he plunged some lymneci suddenly into this mix-
             * Arwalet de Chimie it Ptit/iique,' idmc'ii.
                                                                    " '

  ture.    They did not appear at first much affected, but in eight
  days   they were all dead.
      As we do not know positively, as yet, if the shells which are
  found in certain beds of saccaroidal limestone of transition, and
  in certain compact secondary limestones, have lived in the liquid
  itself, or have formed those soils themselves, or, finally, have been
  brought there accidentally : as, on the other hand, it is very pro
 bable that these kinds of chemical deposits have taken place
  only by the intermedium of a liquid, the solvent faculty of which
 was owing to an excess of carbonic acid, — M. Beudant tried the
 action of water charged with this acid on the molluseae. With this
 view he employed Seltzer water. — The animals plunged into this
 water were quickly suffocated.
     Water charged with other mineral acids in very small quan
 tities produced nearly the same effect.
     Water charged with 0"02 of sulphate of iron affected in the
 same way the molluscs: plunged into it ; — in a few seconds all the
 species submitted to this test, whether univalves or bivalves,
 died.
     Water saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and afterwards
 diluted with its weight of clear water, produced much slower ef
 fects : several molluscs even made various movements in it ; but
 in a few days they died, the one after the other.
     After these preliminary trials, it was natural to examine if    it
was not possible gradually to habituate the molluscs of fresh
 water to live in the waters into which they had been previously
plunged so suddenly.       In spring 1809, ther-efore, M. Beudant
 collected a great number of fresh-water molluscae in the environs
of Paris: he separated the species, and divided the number of
individuals of each of them into two equal portions, putting each
into a vessel by itself : he thus formed two series of the same
species, each including the same number of individuals : he pre -
served one as a point of comparison in Seine water, and upon
the other he attempted the gradual transition which he had in
view.
     M. Beudant had at first employed for several days water con-
taiping only one grain of salt per pound, i. e. about 0*00011 : he
afterwards successively increased the quantity of salt ; first l>y
adding a grain every two days, and then every day; and latterly,
three grains a day.      The experiment lasted six months ; at the
end of which time the liquid employed contained 0*04 of its
weight of salt, comprising about 0 005 of muriate of lime.
     By proceeding in this way, most of our fresh -water molluscae
were completely habituated to live in salt water, in which thev
seemed to be perfectly at ease.       But in order to make the ex
periment previse, and to draw certain consequences from it,
                                                              M. Beu

                    live in Salt-water, and vice versa.                  225
    •M. Beudant     noted carefullv the number of individuals which
    died, on the one hand, in fresh water; and on the other, in salt
    water : it was in this way that he ascertained the differences
    about to be noticed.
        All the species of lvmnreae and planorbes, the physis of cold
    springs ; and the patella facustris live perfectly well in salt water.
    In fact, in the space of five months, there died in the fresh water
    fifty-four of the hundred animals which had been kept in       it,  and
    in the salt water there died fifty-seven of the hundred    ;   the dif
    ference   isscarcely worth mentioning.
        On the contrary, the other species of paludines {helix vivipara-,
.   helix tentaculata of Linnreus), and the nerites of the Seine
    seemed to suffer from their long continuance in salt water, and.
    more died than in fresh water.       In short, in the fresh water only
    forty  of the hundred   died
                               ;   and  in the salt water 6Cventy-one of
    the hundred died.
        All the bivalve molluscae, the nnodontes, the mulettes, and th6
    cyclades, put into salt water died during the experiment, and
    before the liquid had attained the degree of sakness Which            it
    was necessary to attain.      On the contrary, they lived the whole
    summer in fresh water, and continued in     it   at the end of autumn*
    It  must be remarked, however, as an important result, that these
    same species lived perfectly' well in water charged with onlv
    0-02 of salt.       .
        M. Beudant also resumed the experiment which he had be
    gun with water charged with sulphate of lime, in order to ha
    bituate the molluscs gradually to live in it. At first he diluted
    with  a   great quantity of Seine water, the water which was
    strongly saturated with this kind of salt: afterwards he kept di
    luting it  gradually; and lastly, he employed        it completely sa
    turated.     The molluscae at first lived very Well: subsequently
    several died, in proportion as the quantity of salt was increased      ;
    and lastly, the few remaining died when the saturated liquid was
     used.    This experiment repeated at two subsequent periods gave
     the same result.
        We now come to the experiments on marine molluscs; which
     M. Beudant made in 1812 and 1813.
         He collected several individuals of various kinds of marine
     testaceae, such as the patellae, fissar'ellae, crepidulse, haliotides^
     sabots, cerites, buccinae, tellines, venuses, oysters, &c. &c.
        Several individuals of the above genera, when plunged sud
    denly in fresh water, contracted within their shells, and died in
     that state.    Those species only which live habitually on rocks
     placed out of the water lived a little longer, but they soon
     perished also.

proper for determining the gradual transition of the sea molluscae
in fresh water, also formed two series of the same species. He
preserved one constantly in sea water, and employed for the other
sea water diluted successively with fresh water.       Five months
afterwards he employed nothing but fresh water.
   By means of this precaution, the marine molluscae were habi
tuated to fresh water, in which they lived during five months
more with lymnees and planorbes.         There were some peculiar
circumstances attending them, which M. Beudant relates ; viz.
   The patellae of the vulgar species, and the sabots, which are
both sea shore shellfish — the cerites, the columbellae, the ve-
nuses, the oysters, &c. perfectly resisted the experiment.    There
died thirty-four out of the hundred individuals constantly kept
in sea water, and thirty-six out of the hundred of those exposed
to fresh water.
    But the dragon-headed patella;, the fissurellae, the crepidulae,
the undated buccinas, the cameos, &c. all died during the ex
periment.     It ought to be remarked, however, that all the species
lived peffectly well in sea water diluted with an equal portion of
fresh water, i. e. in water containing about 0 02 of its weight of
salt.
   Having learned by Lavoisier's analysis that the waters of lake
Asphaltus contained 0*40 of saline substances*, and as accord
ing to travellers no organized living body is to be found in                 it,
M. Beudant was desirous of knowing what degree of saltness
marine animals could support.        Consequently he added impure
muriate of stfda to common sea water, and he was convinced
that all the sea molluscae which he had at his disposal lived,
without any apparent inconvenience, in water containing 0-31
of saline matter composed chiefly of muriate of soda, with some
centimes of muriate of lime and muriate of magnesia.          But as
often as he increased the quantity of salt, so as that small crystals
were formed on       a  slight evaporation in the air, the animals
shrunk within their shells, and died.
    M. Beudant concludes         by
                                 drawing the following inferences:
     1. Since there  isevery reason to believe that the same water,
whether fresh, or salt like that of the sea, or even Salter,      ca    is
pable of supporting all the animals which frequent marshes,
rivers, and the sea-shore,      may be presumed that similar cir
                                it
cumstances have existed in nature, and to these circumstances
it   isowing that we see in one and the same stratum sea and

laud shells;    admitting always,    as   everything seems to prove, that
these shells are still in the place where they have lived originally.
   2. If we could suppose with some naturalists, contrary to all
 appearance, that the strata called fresh-water strata have been
all formed under      sea water, the present experiments will ac
 count for the absence (in other respects very remarkable) of the
bivalve river shells of the genera anodontes, mulettes, and cy-
 clades.    In fact, we have seen that the molluseae which live in
 these shells were not able to live in water charged like that of
 our seas, with 0'04 of saline substances.
  . 3. Since it results from experiments many times
                                                     repeated, that
 the molluseae, at least those of fresh water, cannot live in water
 charged with sulphate of lime, we can account for there being
 no shells in the gypseous mass of Montmartre, and in general in
.the old or new gypsums, although they are frequently in layers
 subordinate to shelly strata.
    4. Since the marine molluseae can live in water almost satu
 rated with muriate of soda, it would seem that the absence of
 living organized bodies in lake Asphaltus, if this really be the
 case, is owing to the presence of the bitter muriates of lime and
 magnesia, and perhaps to that of the bituminous matters which
  Lavoisier has not found in his analysis, without doubt, because
 they are but occasionally met with and under certain circum
stances only.
    On the other hand, since the sea molluseae perish in water
hypersaturated with muriate of soda, it is not astonishing that
none of their remains have been found in the immense masses of
sal gemma, which are found in various countries.
    5. Lastly, if we admit that sea and fresh water molluseae can
live in the same liquid, it would seem to result, that the fact of
living in fresh or in salt water cannot be a reason for establishing
particular genera, unless we can find sufficient and constant
characters in shells, or, what is better still, in the animals which
 occupy them, when they are not fossil.

asserted    that the alkalis did not precipitate the solution                     of gold
in the cold way. M. Oberkampf had obtained a contrary result ;
but he thought he could account for this difference by the ex
cess of acid of the solution, which gave rise, with the precipitat
ing alkali, to the formation of a great quantity of triple salt, in
decomposable, at least totally, by an excess of base ; for it is
certain that there is no precipitate made in the cold way in the
space of several minutes, even with ammonia, when the excess
of acid is sufficient. The object of M. Figuier is to prove that
the excess of acid of the solution of gold does not prevent the
precipitation of the oxide by an alkali, and that we obtain nearly
as much of it as from a solution as neutral as possible.
   " Six grammes of dry muriate of gold," says M. Figuier,
   were dissolved in 150 grammes of distilled water ; the solu
tion when filtered was divided into two equal parts, and put
into two conical glasses.    Into one I poured four grammes of
muriatic acid: I saturated both solutions with caustic potash
dissolved in water : their yellow colour became a deep red.          A
short time afterwards, the liquors became turbid: a flaky
precipitate of a gray colour was developed : these precipitates
increased after some time and became deeper: — after forty-
eight hours they appeared to be at their maximum of augmen
tation and colour.     I observed no difference between the two,
only that in order to produce              it,
                                      we must employ      greater por    a
tion of potash     the acid muriate of gold, than in that which
                        in                                                             is
less so but
       ;         constantly observed that in both cases
                    I                                          was re        it
quisite that the potash should be in excess, in order to make the
precipitates abundant.      After having filtered these liquors se
parately,  I put them   into small retorts and exposed them to the
action of     moderate heat; new precipitates were still formed
                a
much deeper         in
                 colour.      added them to the first, washed them
                                   I
with pure water, and dried them. When weighed in this state
their weight represented two-thirds of the gold which was in
solution — that obtained from the acid solution did not differ
           ;
from that which had only         decigramme of acid.
                                       a                   The liquors
which had furnished these precipitates still contained gold they                  :

  prder to precipitate the whole gold from a solution into which
 an excess of alkali has been put, we must add acid and super
 saturate again with alkali, we may easily explain by this circum
 stance the results of Messrs. Vauquelin and Oberkampf, for they
 did not think of the process employed by M. Figuier.     In short,
 wc have such a confused idea of this process, that although we
 do not doubt its efficacy, we should like to see it repeated by
 other chemists.

 Col.   James Capper has lately published, at Cardiff in South
 Wales,   a work of considerable merit, entitled  " Meteorological
 and Miscellaneous Tracts, applicable to Navigation, Gardening,
 and Farming, with Calendars of Flora for Greece, France, Eng
 land, and Sweden."        The following subjects constitute the
most interesting part of the work :
    Observations on the cause and consequences of the tempe
rature in different latitudes; and observations on the aurora
borealis, and the frequent occurrence of tempests about twenty-
four hours after its appearance.      There are also some curious
remarks on the lunar influence on terrestrial bodies, and some
very useful and interesting observations on the local varieties of
temperature in different parts of Great Britain.

Admiral de Chapman, a distinguished naval officer, and super-
intendunt of the dock-yards of Sweden : they exhibit a chain of
research which has led to the valuable and remarkable discovery
of a law of nature regarding water, which could not possibly
have been attained by mathematical induction, or any reasoning
 a priori, and which involves conclusions of the greatest import
ance, not merely as to the lest form for the construction of
ships capable of moving with the greatest velocity through water,
but even as respects the best form for piers of bridges in rivers
 subject to inundation, or where the current is rapid.         The work

                   NEW VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD.                         '.
 A    French merchant of Bourdeaux has eq-uippeda vessel for
 the circumnavigation of the globe.        It is described as a strong
 swift-sailing vessel of 200 tons burden, called the Bordelais, and
 will be commanded by officers of the French navy. The fol
 lowing lias been published in the French journals as the projected
track of this expedition.       The Bordelais will double Cape Horn,
 and will not anchor until she arrives on0 the coast of Chili : she
 will then proceed to California, visit Nootka Sound and the ad
jacent shores, trafficking with, the natives for peltry y this track

                             French Colonies.                          231
will be continued to Cook's river along the coast, and as far
north as possible.       From Nootka Sound the vessel will proceed
to the Sandwich Islands for pearls and sandal wood, &c. The
circumnavigators will then proceed to China, and from thence
return to Bordeaux.
                            FRENCH COLONIES.
    The French Government have sent out an expedition to Sene
gal, with a view to re-colonize that once flourishing settlement.
The French frigate La Meduse, which carried out the governor
and settlers, was unfortunately wrecked, and about 150 indivi
duals perished in a most dreadful manner from hunger, thirst,
drowning, insanity, and mutual assassination, on a raft on which
they were abandoned for many days to the mercy of the waves.
The following account is given in the French papers of the suc
cess of the survivors :
                                                         Paris, Sept. 22.
    The latest intelligence from Senegal announces, that not only
the boats of the French frigate Meduse had arrived at St. Louis,
                                                                           '
but that the governor and officers had even saved all their effects.
Part of the ship-wrecked mariners had followed along the coast,
and arrived without any accident, except M. Kummer the na
turalist, an,d one of the delegates of the Philanthropic Colonial
Society.      This traveller, having wandered away from his com
panions    to  discover fresh water, found an abundant and limpid
spring ;    but  while he was drinking, he was taken prisoner by a
party of ^raersas-Moors, to whom he called himself an officer
of high rank, which made them conduct him to the French fort,,
mounted on a fine horse.         The governor rewarded them hand
somely.      All the  instruments    of agriculture sent by the Colonial
Society     were  swallowed   up  in  the waves.    This is a heavy loss,
and will retard all attempts at cultivation for at least a year.
    The delegates who are in the village of Dacar have already
explored the peninsula of Cape Verd, where they hope to form
their first establishment.     This peninsula is not very fertile, but
it has nevertheless all the resources necessary for forming a co
lony: it has land capable of being ploughed, salubrious water,
a temperate climate, and good pasturage: it is separated from
the rest of the states of Darnel, of which it forms part, by de
files, where three or four hundred inhabitants of the peninsula
lately arrested the progress of the whole army of Damel, ten
thousand men strong.          This African prince seems disposed to
 cede a territory in which he exercises a most uncertain authority.
 The delegates of the Colonial Society expect to come to an un
 derstanding with the inhabitants.         One of them, M. Parsen, has
drawn up a report on the subject, and transmitted it to France.

    The French have also formed a colonial establishment at Rio
Janeiro, hut not with the official sanction of the Government.
This colony is formed of male and female emigrants' who were
expatriated in consequence of the late political changes in France.
It consists of 400 persons : they have obtained from the Portu
guese government three houses, with furniture, and some negroes
as domestics ; they receive dailv rations offish, flesh, fruits, and
Madeira or Port wine.       Every planter receives from the State a
large portion of ground ; but this liberality is of little value, from
its being difficult to clear in consequence of the want of in
struments.

Peddie and Captain Campbell, instead of carrying out barometers
as is usually done, fitted up with frames, for ascertaining the
height of such mountains as they may meet with on their ex

 any of which they can fill when occasion requires with mercury,
 and by this means obviate the inconvenience often arising from
getting barometers broken on like excursions.          Captain Camp
bell took a dozen tubes, anv one of which it requires but little
 dexterity to fill, and which when filled and inverted in an open
vessel is ready for use.       —  :
                     IMPROVEMENT OF RAPE OIL.
 A   Simple Method of rendering        Rape Oil equal to Spermaceti
               Oil, for the purposes of Illumination
              To the Secretary of the Cork Institution.
    Sir — Nothing struck me more, on my arrival in Ireland, than
 the little use made of the patent lamp, which is in such common
 and universal use in England and on the continent.              But my
surprise in a great measure ceased, on findmg spermaceti oil at
 such an exorbitant price in Ireland.      In London it is sold by re
 tail, in the dearest shops in Bond-street, at seven English shil
 lings a gallon, and here, at twelve Irish shillings per gallon, — an
 extravagant price every one must allow, and fully sufficient to
 check the use of this lamp in a very great degree.
    I thought I should render the public a very great service,
 could I, by some mode, render any of the cheap.oils of our country
 effectual for the service of that lamp. Many persons in England
told me, that our oils were of too gelatinous and viscous a nature
to be drawn up in the capillary tubes of the cotton wick. 1 there-

 fore perceived the first thing I had to effect was, to deprive them
 as much as possible of those two bad qualities.       I entered into
 a variety  of experiments, some of them long and tedious, which
 I shall not take up your time by enumerating.
    1 began by washing the oil with spring water ; which is effected
by agitating the oil violently with a sixth part of the water. Thi*
separates the particles of the oil, and commixes those of the
water intimately with them.       After this operation, it looks like
the yolks of eggs beat up. — In less than forty-eight hours thev
separate completely, the oil swimming at top, the water with ail
feculent and extraneous particles subsiding at the bottom.           I
improved very much on this, by substituting sea-water in the
place of fresh water.     I tried whether fresh water impregnated
with salt, may not do as well as sea-water ; but found the light
not so bright, and of a reddish cast. — The oil which I have
washed is rape oil, for which 1 am charged 4s. 4d. a gallon.         I
have now made use of it constantly for two months : it gives no
bad smell, and when burning close to the spermaceti oil is not
to be distinguished.
    A friend of mine has calculated the expense of a lamp against
that of a pair of mould candles, and says the lamp is much
cheaper. After this, is to be compared the elegance of the one
against the vulgarity of the other.
    Count Rumford estimated one patent lamp to give as much
light as four wax-candles, from the whiteness and brilliancy of
its flame.
    By the process of washing, the oil does not lose one-hundredth
part.     The experiment can at all times be made in a glass de
canter.     I purpose making it in a churn, with a cock at the
bottom, the water to come up very near to the cock, by which
all the oil can be drawn off, after it has deposited its impurities.
    I have the honour to be, sir, your very obedient servant,

the same month, Woolf's engine at Wheal Abraham (with a load
of 3 lib. 1 per square inch in the cylinder) lifted 28,933,734
pounds one foot high, and his other engine at the same mine
 (loaded 15*1 per square inch) 49,655,962 pounds one foot high

                 THE LATE EARTHQUAKE        IN*   SCOTLAND.
                                                                Coul, Sept.   .
    The earthquake was scarcely felt beyond lat. 58 deg. nor was
 the concussion at all severe southward of the Tay : oh the western
 coast, it was distinctly felt at Gareloch : more severely at Anple-
 cross, and less severely to the southward.         From the interior I
 have got no accounts that can be depended on.            Two men, who'
 were travelling eastward from Loch Carron, said to a friend
 of mine, that when they were crossing the hill which is nearly
 the summit level between Loch Carron and Cdntin, not far from
 a place called Carnoch, the shock threw them on their backs.
 If this be true, it proves that it came from the westward ; as, if
                                                                           '
 it had come in the contrary direction, and met them, they would
 have fallen forward.      Though more damage was done at Inver
 ness than elsewhere, there is no reason for supposing that the
 seat of the earthquake was under that town.          If we suppose that
 the motion    was  communicated     circularly from a centre, and that
 the centre was below Inverness, we find that Aberdeen, where
 the shock was pretty smart, and Perth, where it was very distinct,
 are nearly at the same distance, viz. about 80 or 90 miles, in a
 straight line.    Now, the shock was scarcely felt at Cromarty,
 and  was   barely perceptible at Tarbat Ness, which is about half
 that distance from the centre.         Tne reason why Inverness sus
 tained so much damage         is, that the town       is built mostly on
 gravel, and partly on mossy ground, the shifting of which might
 have done more damage than actually happened.                In     moun
                                                                     a
tainous country,     the communication      of motion  must    be so  much
modified    by  the mountain masses, that          will probably remain
                                                  it
 always uncertain, from underneath what spot the shocks of earth
 quakes proceed.       That the late shock had its origin under some
 part  of Inverness-shire,  there     no reason for doubting.
                                     is                               have

 remarked, that notwithstanding the very unusual quantity of rain
that has fallen during this season, the rivers of the north are not
 at all swollen.    In ordinary summers,   I   have known them reach
to the top of their banks, in consequence of few days rain with
                                                  a                   :           a
greater quantity of late, that effect has not been produced. Some
springs, too, have observed to be unusually scanty but my obser
             I                                              ;
vation of springs has not been very general. — From the extentover
which the shock was felt, there reason to suppose that the blow
                                      is
was deep seated. Hence, though we may expect other visitations
of this kind, We need not fear the eruption of the internal fire in
dur time.     From what   I   have observed in volcanic countries,            I
have no doubt that earthquakes are occasioned                by
                                                             the produc
tion of * vast quantity of elastic vapour, the prodigious force of
which suddenly bursts its confinement.          Steam   is the most pro

bable agent ; though     other fluids may also act with sufficient
energy.    Whether   there    has been any connexion hetween the
uncommon badness      of  the weather, and the subterraneous phe
nomenon which has caused so much speculation, the imperfect
state of the science of meteorology prevents us from determining.
We already know that there is a connexion between the electri
cal state of the earth and that of the atmosphere ; but philoso
phers have not as yet thought the investigation of this subject
worth their pains.    The present theory of the atmospheric phaer
nomena does not appear to me satisfactory; and I doubt not
we shall have new theories very soon.           The field is open and
wide, and wonderful discoveries may yet be expected.

 L. New    Outlines  of Chemical "Philosophy. By Ez.Walker, Esq*
                           of Lynn, Norfolk.
                     [Continued from vol. xlvii. p. 97.]
 M    . De Luc has favoured the philosophical            world with a new
 instrument, which he calls The Electric Column.              The effects of
 this instrument are very wonderful ; for, if we look upon it merely
 as a philosophical toy, it excites our astonishment nearly as much
 as either magnetism, electricity, or galvanism did, when they
 were first discovered : but when, the electric column is used as
 a philosophical instrument, it may tend to enlarge the bounds of
 chemical philosophy; for it has happened-, and not unfrequently,
 that improvements in science were at a stand; until some new
 improvement was made in the arts.
    When we investigate the properties of physical elements,
 which produce such an infinite variety of physical effects, we
 should be very circumspect in our operations, and not content
 ourselves with a single experiment, which may seem to support a
 favourite hypothesis, but vary our experiments ; and if a great
 number of them, made with appropriate instruments, prove the
 truth of the same hypothesis, that hypothesis may be deemed a
 theory, and used as such in all our future investigations.
    The only means we have of investigating physical causes, is
 hy experiment and observation ; for physical certainty does not
 admit of mathematical demonstration ; it is entirely obtained by
 our senses.    We see the sun, and feel his effects, — we view the
 moon and all her various changes; but the existence of those
objects cannot be mathematically demonstrated : all the know
ledge we have of their existence is wholly derived from our senses.
 Hence all our experimental knowledge comes under the deno
mination of physical certainly.
    "  In ascending from effects to causes we must ever arrive,
npon whatever hypothesis we proceed, at some first cause, which
does not admit an explanation from mechanical principles*."
    Now the first causes or elements, by which the various phe
nomena in nature are produced, are three ;' that is to say, gra
vity, magnetism, and electricity: — gravity is a simple element,
but the other two are compounds.          Each pole of aniagnetic bar
contains    a different element.    In two bars homogeneous poles
repel, aird heterogeneous poles attract each other. And the same
law obtains in electricity; for, what have been called positive
and negative electricity are two distinct elements ; — electrical

  elements of the same kind repel, and contrary elements attract
  each other.
      In a former paper I described some improvements that I had
  made in electrometers, and in the modes of insulation.            As these
  improved     instruments     are  highly necessary    in  conducting    the
  following experiments,       I shall  give an  account   of them  here, to
  save the reader the trouble of turning to my former paper.
      The electrometer which I make use of consists of an eight-
  ounce phial with a stopple of sealing-wax fitted into its mouth ;
  through this stopple a piece of thin music wire passes, and ex
  tends down the axis of the glass about 2\ or 3 inches; the top
  of the wire standing 3 or 4 inches above the top of the phial.
  The lower end of the wire is turned into a small ring, from
  which two slips of Dutch metal are suspended ; these are about
  3-4ths of an inch in length and 1- 10th in breadth.              The wire
  is fixed into the stopple ; but the stopple itself is not made fast
  into the mouth of the phial, but left so as to take out occa
  sionally.
      My insulating stands are made thus: — A piece of thermometer
  tube five inches lona; is fixed to the bottom of a wine-glass (the
  top being broken off) with black sealing-wqx, and a piece of a
  stick of the same kind of wax, about an inch and an half in
 length, is fixed upon the top of the tube.            The top of the wax
  being   made    soft, is formed  into  a proper   curve for glass tubes to
 rest upon.        This form is very convenient for making experi
 ments with electric columns ; but a circular piece of glass, hav
 ing its upper surface gilt with gold-leaf, fixed upon the top of
 the wax, is more convenient for many other experiments*.
               Description of a Silver-leaf Electrometer.
     The object of this instrument is to investigate some properties
 of M. De Luc's electric column.            The electric machine collects
 two elements by friction ; the Galvanic apparatus produces the
 same two elements by a chemical process ; but the electric co
 lumn, by some unknown process, produces these elements with
out either friction or chemical action.

the base of the instrument at a.           be a cylinder of black sealing-
 wax, rather thicker than the tnbe; and cd a strip of thin crown
glass, about an inch and a quarter in length and a quarter of an

leaf   f  dp is  fixed  with gum-water; rq is another slip of silver-

 the foot of the instru
 ment, protects the pen
 dulums dp and rq from
 being disturbed by cur
 rents of air.
    The thermometer tube
 all and one end of the
 wire xy are fixed into
 the base on the outside of
 the glass cylinder : the
 other end of the wire yz
 and pendulums are sus
 pended within it.
    To the lower ends of
 the pendulums p and q
 two pieces of thin wire
 are attached, of the forms
 represented in fig. 2.
    Exp.    1. An electric column being laid upon two insulating
Stands   in an horizontal position, an electrometer placed in con.r
 tact with the zinc end of it exhibited only a few degrees of elec
tricity, nor was any greater effect produced on the electrometer
when it was applied to the copper end.        Hence it appears that
the column contains very little electricity in an insulated state.
    Exp. 2. The electrometer remaining in contact with the cop
per end of the column, as soon as a communication was made
between the zinc end and the earth by means of a piece of wiie,
one end of which stood upon the table, with its other end m
contact with the end of the column, the leaves of the electro
meter diverged to an angle of thirty degrees.      This electrome
ter being set aside, and another equally sensible placed in con-
                                Q 2                              tact

244            New Outlines of Chemical Philosophy.
 tact with the zinc end of the column, it diverged to the same
 angle, the wire of communication having been removed to the
 other end.    Hence it appears that the elements of electricity
 came either from the earth or the table, through the wire which
 formed a communication between the table and the column, and
 that the two elements are of equal mechanical forces, for the two
 electrometers were found to be in contrary electrical states.
That element which was received from the copper end of the
 column was thermogen (positive electricity), the other electro
 meter received the contrary element from the zinc end *.
    Exp. 3. Having placed a silver-leaf electrometer in contact
 with the copper end of an insulated electric column, and a com
 munication being made between the table and the zinc end, the
 pendulums vibrated 140 times in a minute.               These vibrations
were performed thus: As soon as the pendulum rq became
 charged by the column, through the wire wr, it attracted and
 charged the pendulum dp. The two pendulums being now
 charged with the same element repelled each other; rq di
 verged to the right, dp to the left, and discharged its contents
 into the wire at z, which conveyed it to the earth. The pen
 dulum dp being now reduced to its natural state, was again
attracted, charged, and repelled by the pendulum rq: thus the
vibrations of the two pendulums were continued.                But as soon
 as the wire of communication        was removed from the zinc end
 of the column, the pendulum ceased to vibrate : hence we may
 conclude that the element which put the pendulums in motion
ascended up the wire at the zinc end, and passed through the
column to the copper end.
    The electrometer being placed at the zinc end of the column,
and the wire of communication against the copper end, the pen
dulums performed the same number of vibrations in a given
time as before, but they ceased to vibrate as soon as the commu
nication was cut off between the copper end and the table. The
pendulums were put in motion at the copper end by thermogen,
the element of heat ; but at the zinc end, photogen, the element
of light, produced an equal effect.
    Exp. 4. Two silver-leaf electrometers, whose pendulums were
of equal lengths, being placed in contact with an insulated elec
tric column, one at each end, began to vibrate at the same time,
and the pendulums at the zinc end performed the same number
of vibrations in a given time, as those at the copper end.
   * Mr. Singer observes, in his Elements of
                                             Electricity, that
                                                               " the electro
meter connected with the zinc extremity of the column will be positive,
that connected with the silver extremity will be negative."
   Mr. Singer was probably led into this error by using Mr. Bennet's elec
trometer, which is a very imperfect instrument.
                                                                       Now

               New Outlines     of Chemical Philosophy.          245
    Now  as these electrometers    were put in motion by two dif
ferent elements, which afterwards descended to the earth at each
end of the column, and as I have four pendulums which have
thus been kept in motion for more than a month j the question
which remains to be solved is, Does the column generate these
two elements as fast as they issue from its ends and descend to
the earth, through the electrometers ? or, are they derived from
some other source ?
    From the third experiment it appears that the pendulums of
an electrometer, placed in contact with one end of a column, do
not vibrate until a communication be made between the other
end and the earth ; and hence we may infer, that the element
which ls,eeps one of the electrometers in motion, ascends through
the other at the other end of the column, and thus a double
current of the elements is passing through each of the electro
meters.
    This inference is not, however, a mere conjecture ; for when
the pendulum           is placed without the sphere of attraction of
the pendulum rq, let the end p of the pendulum dp be moved
by means of a glass rod, till r q attracts, charges, and repels it.
When p strikes the wire at z, it discharges the element which
it received from q, and receives the contrary element from the
wire. The pendulums being now in a contrary state, attract
each other, and the vibrations are continued ; but let the pen
dulum dz be touched with a piece of wire, to deprive it of the
element which it received from the wire at z, and the pendu
lums will instantly cease to vibrate.
    Exp. 5. An electrometer, containing two pendulums which
are each about three inches in length, made as represented in
fig. 2, was placed in contact with the zinc (negative) extremity
of a series of columns; and as soon as another electrometer with
pendulums, each about one inch in length, was placed at the
other extremity, the four pendulums began to vibrate.            The
long pendulums vibrated 140 times in a minute, and struck the
wire at z with so much force as to produce a fine musical tone,
which was loud enough to be heard at the distance of 26 feet.
And these pendulums vibrated an equal number of times in a
minute, and produced the same strength of tone, when they
were removed to the copper extremity of the series : the short
pendulums being removed to the other extremity vibrated as be?
fore, about 300 times in a minute.

When          your ladyship persuaded me again to take up my geo
logical pen ; and, as an inducement, permitted me to address my
speculations to yourself, I intended to have limited them to the
facts exhibited in our own country, part of which I had the
honour of showing to your ladyship.
     I then intended to proceed to the application of these facts,
 and others within the reach of your own observation, to the
theories maintained by the Neptunian philosophers, to which
 your ladyship had recalled my attention, through a recent pub
 lication of some celebrity.
     I find, however, that I cannot stop, but must avail myself of
 your permission to carry your ladyship to more distant regions :
 — drawing general conclusions both from the magnificent scenes
  I led you through, and from the corresponding features of a re
  mote island, exhibited on a still grander scale.
     The similarities of these countries so distant from each other,
  and the facts establishing them, shall form the subject of the
 present letter: while the greater part of the next shall be limited
 to the conclusions fairly drawn from them. But when rigid de
 monstration can no longer be obtained, 1 hope your ladyship will
  excuse me for indulging my imagination, and wandering into the,
 regions of probability, and even of conjecture.

    My author does not claim to be a scientific naturalist, but he
is obviously a very acute observer ; and though he seems to have
adopted, without examination, the volcanic theory of the origin
of basaltes, which was in fashion when he left Europe, he pos
sesses a degree of fairness and impartiality        which I have seldom
met with in naturalists attached to a particular                opinion or
theory.    My friend was induced to send me this pleasant little
volume, because the picture it gave of St. Helena bore so striking
a resemblance to the features of the basaltic area in the north of
Ireland, that had so much occupied the attention of each of us,
and to which my own observations on the natural history of my
country had been nearly limited.
    It was not only the similitudes in the original arrangement of
each of these districts, which were numerous and obvious, but
also the differences, that strongly arrested my attention ; the
former affording demonstration of the exact similarity of ori
ginal formation, while the latter proved irresistibly that the
posterior operations of nature, which have taken place in St. He
lena and in our part of Ireland, though in some instances the
same, are very^different in others.
   Hence a new field is opened, and new materials afforded for
geological discussion, particularlv interesting to me, as the facts
which I observed in my own country, that led me to sustain po
sitions sometimes deemed paradoxical, are not only exhibited in
equal abundance in St. Helena, but also so diversified as to af
ford new arguments and further demonstration of the truth of
those positions.
   That island has now acquired a new interest — the eyes of the
world are directed towards it and its new inhabitant.            The Latin
poet   seems   to  allude   to this sequestered spot,   as  now  colonized,
which he describes,
             " Ut mm is

    Wliile the English nation is making such exertions to secure
the comfort of this great exile — let us find amusing employment
for him ; let us direct his attention to the natural history of his
new country,      and we shall probably protect him from the misery
into which the exiled Ovid fell ; and from disgracing himself by
unmanly complaints, as that poet did, on the harshness of a cli
 mate nearly as mild as that of St. Helena itself.
    I too have prepared a source of entertainment for him, as my
pupil Colonel Wilkes, the late governor, after showing the great

visions either for man or his domestic animals, has taught its in
habitants how to supply the wants of the latter most abundantly,
by the introduction of this valuable grass, of which he has lately
sent home, to be transmitted to me, some magnificent specimens
raised by himself in this new field.
   The emperor Diocletian, a mighty conqueror also, after wield
ing his sceptre  a  long time over nearly the     same    territory with
the emperor Bonaparte, found content          and amusement in the
culture of his cabbages.
    Let then his successor take cordially to the culture of the ve
getable he finds just established in St. Helena, and he will pass
the remainder of his time smoothly, showing the world, quite
contrary to their expectations,        that he wiil end his days in
peaceful amusement, and that
             " Fmem aninire qua: res hunianas miscuit olim
               Non gladii non saxa dabuntnon tela."
   I shall now return to the natural history of this curious littla
island, and shall endeavour to trace the exact similitude in ori
ginal construction between our own basaltic district and this
remote spot.
   The first and most striking point of resemblance seems to be
in the accurate stratification of both countries, and the sameness
of the arrangement of the same materials in each.
   Our author, in his preface, tells us of the " horizontal beds of
basaltes;" and in his 52d page, "stratified appearances of the
declivities of the hills, consisting of layers which rise one above
another."
   " All  the matters of which the island is composed are placed
in beds, various in their depth, colour, and texture."
    " On the steeper declivities, the projecting ends of the strata
resemble flights of steps rising above one another."
    Could I have given a more accurate description of the arrange
ment of the strata, so beautifully displayed, in both the perpen
dicular and steep precipices lining so much of our northern
coast ?
   Our author talks of the terraced form of St. Helena. — .Ter
races are common with us. — The island of Rathlin is a mass of
terraces; this form arises from original stratified construction,
and posterior removals.
   The leading, and I believe the sole material in each, is ba
saltes ; a fossil upon which Nature seems to have impressed a
peculiar character, wherever she has been pleased (as often) to
form a distinct area of this curious stone.
   Our author tells us : " the rock which forms the principal
                                                                   strata

                       and County   of Antrim.                   249
strata   of the island appears evidently to be basaltes ; it is always
regularly fissured, and  running   in  distinct layers; these layers
have always somewhat    of  a columnar   appearance."
   " The front of the columns is sometimes flat, but more ge
nerally prominent and angular."
   Again, "We sometimes find a series of columns of equal height,
resembling- a piece of artificial work."
   Are not these series the beautiful groups so abundant with us,
to which the country-people give the name of organs ?
   There is not any circumstance in our Antrim fapades which
has struck me more than the general tendency of the basaltes to
assume a columnar form, though often very imperfect ; and this
not from decay, but from failure in the original effort to obtain
greater regularity.
   The same effort of Nature is observable at St. Helena : — " In
the most irregular masses we can always observe a tendency to
wards this columnar form."
   The next material I shall mention common to St. Helena and
Antrim, and disposed exactly in the same manner in each, is
ochre; this bright red substance Mr. St. Fond sustains to be
basalt which has undergone some chemical process of Nature
with which we are not acquainted.        In this opinion I have ac
quiesced : but my author calls it clay, and it seems equally abun
dant and similarly arranged in both countries.
    " Numerous layers of clay; that of a bright red is the most
common, often seen in layers of only a few inches thick ; these
red veins traverse the whole island."
   This red matter, with my author clay, with me rock, is dis
posed everywhere as with us :
                                  " In the heart of the rock we find
nodules of clay, and among the clay nodules of rock."
    There is not any circumstance on our whole coast, that al
ways struck me more forcibly, than the transitions of our strata
into each other in a vertical direction ; for though there be a
great difference between the component rocks, both in material
and in the principle of internal construction, yet they invariably
 pass into each other nearly per sallum, and we never find tiie
 solidity or continuity of. the so different materials interrupted.
 Such, too, seems to be the style of the junctions of the strata at
 St. Helena —
                " The rock in some places terminates, above and
 below, in indurated blue or black clay, continuous with it ; but
 passing so insensibly into it, that we cannot discern at what point
 the stone ends or the clay begins."
    I discovered a very curious fact, sometimes, though rarely oc
 curring with us, in a few distinct strata; that   is,cavities
                                                             ; some
 now, the rest prqbably once, filled with pure fresh water, as in   a
 quarry or stratum, open at Ballylagan, the stratum at Islamore,
                                                                 and

2.">0                  Geology  — St. Helena,
and the 1 1 th stratum counting from the water at Bengore pro
montory: — in the debris from this stratum, both at Portmoon,
and near the causeway, on its west side, I find such cavities; but
at the causeway itself, or its more contiguous strata, I never found
either water or internal cavity: — at St. Helena this singular fact
also occurs, but seems still more rare — " In a quarry, the stone
when broken is found to have many large internal cavities,
which contain a pure and wholesome water, shut up in the body
of the rock."
    The most striking feature of resemblance between the basaltic
districts of St, Helena and Antrim, is to he found in the whyn
dykes, so common to each ; — these mighty walls, which seem,
peculiar to basaltic countries, though they are often found to
extend and diverge into districts formed of different materials,
seem to have excited little notice until very modern times : even
Dr. Hamilton, in his celebrated Letters, which gave the first philo
sophical account of our curious coast, very slightly notices those
contiguous to Ballycastle ; letting all the others issuing from the
precipices on the east and west of the Giant's Causeway, and
burying themselves in the sea, entirely escape him, though more
magnificent and more decidedly marked than those he men
tions; nor did he examine in those he notices their singular in
ternal construction, the consummate regularity of their masonry,
not less wonderful than their external wall-like forms.
    I have always considered our whyn dykes as more curious
than our prismatic and columnar groups, which seem hitherto
to have absorbed most of the attention given to our wonderful
coast; — regular internal arrangement is not peculiar to basaltes,
nor are the vertical prisms and pillars forming our magnificent
colonnades more wonderful than the equally regular horizontal
prisms of which our whyn dykes are constructed,
    For an account of the whyn dykes on our Antrim coast, I
must refer to the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy for
the year 1SQ2.     These dykes, when I gave in my Memoir on
that subject, I thought sufficiently grand; but how insignificant
do they now appear, when compared with the St. Helena dykes,
or with those more recently discovered on the rocky mountains,
the range that divides the vast American continent, the divortia
aquarum whence the waters are poured from their elevated
sources in opposite directions to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans,
at a distance of some thousand miles !
    Of the grandeur of the latter dykes we have sufficient evidence,
but want particulars; the St. Helena dykes are well described
by our author ; he calls them
                                  " huge vertical strata of broken
and fissured rock, which traverse the whole, from the base to the
summit."
                                                              I must

                        and County         of Antrim.                 251
    I must here    observe,    that wherever our author uses the word
fissured, he means the divisions into pillars or prisms ; that
is,     the basaltic arrangement,        common both to dykes and
            —  He   proceeds
                                " Resting   on the summit of these hills,
 facades.                     :
 we see huge detached masses of rock, which rise several hundred
 feet above them:" again, " One observes here, besides the hori
 zontal and parallel strata, that they are ail penetrated        by  huge
 perpendicular strata of loose and fissured rock."
     " With respect to the perpendicular strata — they are often of
 great breadth, and all regularly fissured         ; the fragments quite
 separate and distinct    :   but as uniformly fashioned, and evenly
 placed, as the stones of building."
                              a
     " Several of these vertical strata rose considerably above the
 plane of the hills which they penetrated, and presented the ap
 pearance of huge walls of stone, surmounting their summits, and
 descending along their declivities to the base."
     There appears to be an exact similarity between the prismatic,
  stones of which the St. Helena and Antrim dykes are formed.
      " The fragments which compose them are of all sizes, some
  of them being six or eight feet long, others only          afew inches,
  but so regular and smooth, that they seem well adapted to the
  purposes of masonry, without the aid of the chisel or hammer."
  I      have stated the pillars of our Antrim colonnades to be formed
 by    the accumulation (in       vertical direction) of prisms, exactly
                                  a
  similar; but that these have no internal principle of construc
  tion, the great joint breaking irregularly, and with       a conchoidal
  fracture   —  while the great prisms    of which  our dykes are formed,
  and laid as                   mason, in      horizontal position, have
                         by
             it     were a                    a
a    subordinate principle of construction, breaking, not like the
  others, with a     conchoidal fracture, but into smaller prisms,     al
  ready formed, with their sides brown and polished; and          I   call,
  for distinction, these two descriptions, component and consti
  tuent prisms,   a   style of construction peculiar to whyn dvkes, and
  which extends also to those in St. Helena, as appears clearlv from
 the foregoing passage.
    Our author tells us       "
                          of masses of irregular rock cemented to
 gether  with ponderous lava." Nothing commoner with us than
              a
 masses  of sound basaltes, cemented together           by
                                                      sort of solid
                                                             a
 basaltic mortar, the fracture Qf the former, blue    of the latter

 gray, and  granular; such     the mass
                                      is  of rock upon which Dun-
 luce castle stands.
      cannot be deemed
      It                  extraordinary  that districts formed bv
 Nature of the same materials, should have these materials simi
 larly arranged in each    but where we find differences, we are
                              ;
  led to inquire whether they arise from   diversity in the original
                                                  a
 formation, or are the result of posterior operations;       and         if
                                                                  we

 252                    Geology   — St. Helena,
  we suspect the latter, by diligent attention we may perhaps be
  able to trace the effect to the cause, and so be able to establish
  the existence of these posterior operations, and their manner of1
  acting.
     The striking difference between the present appearance of
  St. Helena and the basaltic coast of Antrim, seems to consist in
  the superior magnificence of the whyn dykes of the former, and
  their exhibition of their real form of walls, by their immense ele
 vation above the surface in their proper shape — while our dykes,
  as accurate walls as the other, and also of prodigious height,
  rarely emerge from the stratified materials they cut. through, so
  as to show their real form of wall to a careless observer; yet in
  some few instances they do exhibit themselves as actual walls,
  rising above the surface, and pointing in the direction of the
 greater remains of the wall, unequivocally displayed in the con
 tiguous fagade, as at Port Cooan and Portnabaw.
     Another material difference occurs between St. Helena and
 Antrim. — I have sustained that the latter has never been the
 seat of volcanic fires, nor exhibits any marks of having been
 acted upon by that powerful element ; — while the marks of
 dreadful combustion are unequivocal over the whole island of
 St. Helena.     Our author tells us:                            '
     " The structure of St. Helena seems to demonstrate that it
 is the work of subterraneous fire/'
     " The ancient seat of volcanic fires, and subterraneous explo
 sion."
     How have these fires operated ? Not by that instrument we
 call a volcano, whose mode of acting is quite familiar to us. ever
 since Sir W. Hamilton has been so particular in his account of
 our two great European volcanoes : — the combustion of St. He
lena has been general ; fire has acted violently upon its whole
surface, but its intensity seems gradually to abate as we ascend
from the water edge to the highest point of the island ; at a low
level the matters are so scorched and scorified, as not to admit
degradation and decomposition into vegetable mould ; hence
the lower parts of the island are black and torrified, naked and
barren, incapable of sustaining plants ; but as we ascend, vege
tables begin to appear ; and where the elevation is great, the
verdure becomes spendid.
    Thus we are told — " the exterior parts of the island, all round
where they border on the sea, present the appearance of a burnt
and scorified shell, black, rugged, and mouldering, without the
least trace of vegetation."
    " Some of the interior ridges of hills, which are much higher,
are covered with verdure."
    " The central ridge is covered to the summit with the most
                                                            luxuriant

                        and County     of Antrim.                     253
luxuriant herbage, and with groves of indigenous shrubs and
trees — lower down we observe numerous groups of argillaceous
hills, all perfectly naked ; it is indeed near the water's edge,
and under its surface, that we find the largest masses of lava,
and of volcanic cinders and scoria."
    We have abundant proof in our own country, that decomposed
basalt produces a beautiful verdure at the greatest elevations ; —
the little valleys lining the bases of our most elevated basaltic
facades, at Magilligan, Cave Hill, and Monyneeny, are of a bril
liant green ; and the high verdure of the steep precipices lining
Bengore promontory, strikes every one ; yet these green decli
vities are rarely cheered by the rays of the sun, from their
northern exposure, "and approach to perpendicularity.
    In St. Helena, the basaltes and burnt matters are mixed in
a manner that must be very embarrassing to those who under
take to account for the formation of this singular island, and
few naturalists can refrain from indulging             their wise conjec
tures.
    Our author savs,     " All  these   layers   consist of rock, placed
alternately  with   deep beds   of volcanic matters; this rock     is evi
dently basaltes."
    " The   parallel and horizontal     strata leave a wide intermediate
space, which is occupied by          an irregular  mass of agglutinated
volcanic matter."
    "  Frequently eight or ten ascents of rock are separated by
these   volcanic masses."
    This steady alternation of basaltic strata with scorified mat
 ters, evidently burnt, bears no resemblance to any thing yet ob
served at any of our known volcanoes.             Our author, though he
endeavours to     account   for this  arrangement by successive erup
tions, is startled when he can discover no remaining craters.
 Mr. Demarets too, when he attempted to account for the basal
 tic colonnades in Auvergne, as produced by volcanic eruptions,
 admits that in many cases the craters had entirely disappeared,
 and in others that the currents of lava had vanished.           And our
 author tells us expressly, " that in the island' itself there are
 no sulphureous, bituminous, or inflammable matters.";
     In my different memoirs on the subject of our basaltic country^
  1 had repeatedly    asserted that it did not afford a particle of
 burnt matter, scoria, or cinder ; and that our solid basaltic rocks
 did not exhibit the slightest trace of having ever sustained the
 action of fire ; — of late, however, a discovery has been made of
 some quantity of cinders, and scorified matter ; small indeed, —
 but the fact becomes important, when we find that these mat
 ters are disposed in the very same manner in which our author
 found similar matters, to an immense amount, at St. Helena ;
                                                                      that

that  is,between the strata of columnar basalt, alternating with
them in every variety of thickness.
 I   have intheTransactionsof the Royal Society given    minute list
                                                              a
of the strata composing  the promontory  of Bengore.     The mag
nificent stratum forming the tipper range   of pillars at Pleaskin,
is the tenth, counting from the sea —  this    surmounted by an
                                                   is
other stratum of massive pillars, (the eleventh,) of greater dia
meter, coarser material, more imperfect workmanship, and much
shorter.
   We have different views of portions of these strata, from Dun-'
severic to the cascade at Portmoon, where the upper one       taken   is
away for     amile;     appears again at the depression west of
                       it

                                              is
pass into each  other per sullum, without  interrupting the so'idity
or continuity of the material: so that    have no doubt, could we
                                          I
quarry (as we often do at the junction of other strata), the stones
would not break at that junction, but we would find masses con
taining the junction, and portions of each stratum adhering so
lidly.
   After being thus connected for nearly three miles, without any
interruption of their continuity, as they arrive at the western
point of Port Knoffer, almost immediately above the Giant's
Causeway, they are separated for      ashort space by      layer of
                                                                  a
scoria and cinders placed between them, as happens so often at
St. Helena.
   There    isanother remarkable feature in which St. Helena ex
hibits strong marks of having been acted on              by
                                                   intense fire, to
which I   find nothing similar in our basaltic country; — the heat
has been so violent between the basaltic strata, as to act on the
ends of pillars terminating them, without affecting the middle

they were originally placed.

singular island affords any additional support to the wild posi

the original surface of our globe, but much less elevated, and
greatly diversified by the action of powerful agents, with which
we are not acquainted. —That these agents have carried off im
mense masses of our original materials without disturbing what
they left behind — and that the accumulations of our strata once
reached higher than the summits of the loftiest mountains I have
had it in my power to examine.
    The facts from which these positions follow as conclusions,
must be reserved for another letter, in which I mean to gene
ralize ; and after proving that these positions receive the fullest
support from the facts found in St. Helena, I shall probably
extend my views, and show that similar operations have been
performed on other parts of the world, which I have not ex
 amined.
    And what may appear yet more wild — that there is a portion
of the world still reserved for similar operations. ,

 LI I.  On the Excitement of Voltaic Plates; in Reply to Mr. Db
    Luc's Objections to the Doctrines maintained by the Author,
    By J. D. Maycock, M.D.
                        [Concluded  from p. 172.]
 It has never been     my intention to propose a new hypothesis for
explaining   the  excitement  of the Galvanic pile : but as M. Volta's
 (differently modified) appeared to be very generally and impli»
 citly received, I noticed in my Essay some objections to which
 I considered it liable; and as it will not take up much of the
 time of your readers, it may not be amiss to touch on that sub
ject again.
                                                                  The

256             On the Excitement        of Voltaic Plates.
   The fundamental principle of M. Volta's hypothesis               is,  that
from the contact of two metals the equilibrium of electricity- is*
destroyed, and the metals while in contact possess different states
of electricity.     This principle was supposed to be fairly deduc.i
ble from the phenomena of the Voltaic plates.
    In the first place my experiments demonstrate that two plates
of dissimilar metals, not previously electrified, being brought
into contact, indicate no electricity whatever          ;   but on being se
parated   a  change     in their  electrical  stateis   immediately percep
tible, the one being positive and the other negative.               A   sup
position that two bodies are in different states of electricity while
in contact, because they are so after separation, would certainly
be gratuitous  ;    but to affirm that two bodies, which indicate no
electricity whatever, are     in     different electrical states, would be
nothing    less than    to contend    for an absurdity.     In the combina
tion for a Galvanic pile         the   metals   are  brought together, they'
remain in contact    a     considerable time, and during that time the
excitement of the pile commences and continues.                 How can the
excitement which appears in the pile while the metals are in
contadt, be referred to the same principle that occasions the ex
citement of the plates, which never indicate excitement while
in contact — never until they are separated             ?     In the second
place, Mr. De Luc. has clearly demonstrated that the efficient
group consists of two metals, not in contact, but with              a  moist
substance interposed.         How then can the excitement be attri
buted to an electro-motive property of metals, exerted while they
are in contact, when contact does not appear to be an essential
to excitement — nay, when excitement
               ;                              is     not evinced in the case
where contact subsists between the metals, as in dissection the
third     but
          ;   is  fully evident in that, in which contact does not
subsist, as in dissection the first  ?       In the third place the Voltaic
plates   do   not  act   unless   they   are applied    to each other at so
many points       as   to   manifest
                                   a       sensible   cohesion
                                                            ;    but in the
couronne de tasscs, the porcelain trough, and Mr. De Luc's first
dissection of the pile, excitement       is    produced, although the dif
ferent metals are connected         by     very little more thana   physical
point. Again the Voltaic plates do not act unless their surfaces
               ;
be perfectly bright and dry; in the pile the metals, even when
new, are never so clean as the Voltaic plates in general they
                                                        ;
are very much' tarnished, and during their action are never* dry.
Is   there then any analogy between the circumstances necessary
for the excitement of the pile and those necessary for the ex
citement of the Voltaic plates? and how can the phenomena
of the Voltaic plates afford a first principle for explaining the
excitement of the Galvanic pile      ?                                    ,

    nation which has been opposed to it.                1 am aware that it                  is,
    in its turn, liable to some objections.           Nevertheless     appearsit
    to me that      a  decomposable fluid (moisture at least)           always  is
    present during excitement of the pile, and that chemical ac
    tion  is   in some way essential to it.        In what manner the de
    composable fluid acts in producing excitement,                think still
                                                                       I                    a

    nions which have been proposed to account fcr the excitement
    of the Galvanic pile, the Galvanic trough, or the electric column,
    are extremely unsatisfactory.
        Having laid particular stress on the fact that the contact and
    separation of dissimilar metals occasion them to assume different
    electrical states, that the difference           not observable while the

    that the law      is,
                        as far as experiment has gone, general, and not
    confined to metallic bodies*, — ventured to remark in
                                               I                        second  a
    paper f     on the subject of electricity, that the contact and sepa
    ration of successive particles must take place during friction; and
    therefore, that     ifthe phenomena of electricity, as produced                         by
    friction,    could be  consistentlv explained on the principles which
    apply to the excitement of bodies                  by
                                                    contaet and separation,
    then there would be          fair ground for generalization.

    cause of electrical excitement, and that the excitement                fric      by
    tion  is  referable  to this  property.       didI not, however,   attempt
    to carry the generalization further: the cause of excitement of
    the Galvanic pile       do not consider to be yet known, wherefore
                            I
    it  must be impossible to ascertain what relation             bears to the
                                                                       it
    cause of excitement             contact and separation.
                                     by                          In the rapid
    progress of investigation         will no doubt be discovered that the
                                          it
    two causes of excitement, contact and sepaiation, and combina
     tion (if may so express the means of exciting the pile), are both
            I
     referable to one cause, and then the generalization will be per
     fect as far as relates to the facts which at present constitute
     electrical science.     Thus, as knowledge accumulates and reason
    is  successfully exerted, the principles of science become less nu-
'    merous and more general.
        Mr. De Luc, however, objects to the generalization            have at I
     tempted on two grounds:        —  the first, the supposed inaccuracy of
     my experiments, concerning which             shall add nothing to what

258              On the Excitement    of Voltaic Plater,
I  have already said ; — the second, the result of his own experi
ments, which I shall presently consider.
    Before I proceed, let me observe, that although I certainly
have used the word electric in opposition to conductor, it was
by no means my intention to imply that
                                                " the former only had
the faculty to be excited by friction ;" and lest my mode of ex
pression should appear to others, as well as to Mr. De Luc, to
involve such an hypothesis, I would wish substituted the word
 non-conductor for electric wherever the latter occurs in either of
 my papers.
    The experiments, from which is formed Mr. De Luc's second
 ground of objection, are contained in a paper on the electric
 effects of friction*, and tend to prove that friction between si
 milar bodies will produce excitement.        Certainly as excitement
 takes place from the contact and separation of dissimilar bodies,
 and does not from the contact and separation of similar bodiesf,
 the analogy I have endeavoured to establish will not hold, ex
 cept it appears that electricity is excited by the friction of dis
 similar bodies, and is not by the friction of similar bodies.
 That no considerable degree of excitement can be obtained by
 the friction of similar bodies, will I suppose be readily admitted;
 and that the fact is generally true, that it is the friction between
 dissimilar bodies that produces excitement, the few instances
 to the contrary being only exceptions, will also be granted ; and
 I might therefore urge, that it is not fair to bring a few anoma
 lous exceptions to a general rule, in opposition to strong analogies.
 Let me however observe, that if two bodies be precisely similar
 in relation to an experiment, — and if they be made to act on each
 other, their action must be reciprocal, — in that action the acting
 surfaces must both be submitted to a like operation, and it is
 altogether impassible to conceive how the effect on one can differ
 from the effect on the other. Moreover, electrical excitement is,
 as far as we know, confmed to the surface of bodies.           The in
 fluence of dissimilarity of surface in reference to electricity is
 sufficiently known, a difference of colour will occasion a body to
 assume a positive or a negative charge.        If a polished tube of
 glass be excited by friction with flannel, it will be positively elec
 trified ; but if the surface of the same glass tube be ground and
 submitted to the same operation, it will be negatively electrified.
 Supposing Mr. De Luc's experiment to have been performed
 when the apparatus was new, and when the polish on the glass
 rubber and on the glass cylinder was perfect, a very little dif
 ference in the hardness and fineness of the two pieces of glass
 would occasion the surfaces to be differently affected when he

u turned rapidly the winch for           a   little while."          I doubt not that
a polished glass surface would easily be excited by a ground glass
surface : for as the grinding of glass so alters the relation it bears
to woollen cloth, that in its polished state it becomes positive,
and in its rough state it becomes        negative, by friction with          —         it,
so do suppose that the grinding
     I                                 of one of two pieces of glass will
so alter their relations, in point of electricity,           to one another,
that friction between them may occasion excitement.                    Again:
there is  a great variety in glass, arising from the materials of
which     it   manufactured, and we are not satisfied that the
                is
pieces were in the first instance precisely similar.                think also
                                                                          I

on each other, there was some difference as to surface.                     will   I

it  has been " demonstrated that electric motions are produced
only by the substance constituting the density, without any par
ticipation of the fluid producing the electric influences."                   am   I
fully aware, sir, that Mr. De Luc has written all this,                and   has
                                    R    2                           instituted

266             On the Excitement     of Voltaic Plates.
instituted many experiments on the subject: — but I am not sa
tisfied that he has demonstrated it. The species of demonstra
tion to which I have been accustomed, has always carried to
my mind a degree of conviction far more irresistible than any
thing I have ever seen written on the subject of an electric fluid.
I cannot help thinking that the points which are here considered
as demonstrated,      have been only very ingeniously  supposed ; the
suppositions being grounded on their capability (if' true) of ex
plaining electrical phenomena.         I do not mean to argue that
they are not true ; it might be as difficult to prove their falsity
 as their truth ; we all know on whom rests the onus probandi.
Admit them, and probably they will explain very agreeably a
 number of important and interesting phenomena: — Give to
 Archimedes a point on which to rest the fulcrum of his lever,
 and he moves the earth.
    Mr. De Luc also seems to think that the rejection of the idea of
 an electric fluid, such as he has analysed and described, involves
 the whole field of electricity and galvanism in obscurity.      Now
 I cannot possibly conceive how pausing a little before we enter
into the mazes of hypothesis can have such an effect ; at the
same time I am satisfied that by stepping too boldly into the
 wide field of speculation we endanger the interest and reputation
 of science. I do not consider the remote causes of phenomena
to be the objects of science ; but the generalization of the known
 properties of bodies, and the discovery of those properties by
observation and experiment.         Thus, I suppose the science of
physical astronomy complete, although the remote cause of gra
vitation remain for ever unknown ; and the science of pneumato-
logy has been carried to a high degree of perfection by those
 authors who have made no reference to the essential qualities of
spirit; and I cannot perceive an absolute impossibility for all
 phenomena, termed electrical, whether they become evident in
 our confined laboratories or in the great laboratory of Nature,
 the universe, being generalized and arranged in the form of a
science, independent of any curious inquiries as to the existence
 and nature of an electric fluid.       However indispensable, it is
 certainly  not  sufficient that the  causes to which we refer phe
 nomena be capable of explaining them ; they must be known to
 have an existence, before they can be supposed to operate.
" " It is a dictate of common
                                     sense," says the excellent Reid,
 " that the causes we assign of appearances        ought to be real,
 and not fictions of human imagination ; and it is likewise self-
 evident, that such causes ought to be adequate to the effects
 which are conceived to be produced by them."         Impressed with
 this opinion, I do not think it advisable to interweave with ex
 perimental facts and legitimate conclusions, hypothetical as
                                                           sumptions,

sumptions, however ingeniously they may have been conceived,
 or however comprehensive may be their grasp.
    Sir Isaac Newton published his demonstrations of the universal
influence of the law of gravitation, in his admirable work De
Principiis; his speculations concerning an aetherial fluid are
thrown together in the form of query at the end of his Optics :
but the valuable experiments and discoveries of some philoso
phers are so blended with hypothetical reasoning, that it is dif
ficult to separate the one from the other; and this may in some
way account for their having remained without that degree of
attention to which their intrinsic worth entitles them, "meritis
non respondere favorem."
    From the preceding remarks it would no doubt be easy to
collect the reasons which prevented my making a reference to
those papers on electricity, which had been published by Mr.
De Luc previously to the period at which I wrote ; but lest any
mistake should arise, allow me to state them explicitly.
    In the first place, I did not conceive that Mr. De Luc had re
futed Sir H. Davy's hypothesis respecting the cause of chemical
affinity, although I did not think it requisite to give at that time"
the reasons for such an opinion, which being now called upon I
have freely explained.
    In the second place, I did not perceive the absolute necessity
of insisting that Mr. De Luc's experiments with the Voltaic plates
were from some circumstance coarsely executed.             I described
my    own  experiments,   and  the results ; the apparatus  employed,
and the cautions requisite to be observed ; and I was induced to
hope that Mr. De Luc and other gentlemen would repeat these
experiments, and that their observations wduld confirm mine.
    In the third place, In stating some opinions relative to the
excitement of the Galvanic pile, I did not notice that they were
in opposition to Mr. De Luc's conclusions, because I felt per
suaded that all those gentlemen who might honour my commu
nications with a patient perusal, would also be well acquainted
with the papers of so distinguished a philosopher as Mr. DeLuc;
and to their judgement I submitted the difference between our
views on the subject, which difference it would be altogether
impossible for them to overlook.
    In the fourth place, I did not notice Mr. De Luc's experiment
 in which a very slight degree of excitement was perceived in con
sequence of friction between a glass rubber and glass cylinder,
 because I did not think it satisfactory in itself; and deeming it
 at all events an anomalous exception to a general rule, and not
 likely to be admitted in opposition to strong analogy, I left        it,
asI    must now do, to operate with all the force    it possesses.

manner, those parts of my papers which have been thought cen
surable by Mr. De Luc, I cannot omit acknowledging the grati
fication I have derived from his approbation of the other parts ;
and the more particularly as his principal objections to my state
ments, those which he thinks supported by his own experiments,
appear to me to have arisen from his having misunderstood the
purport of what I have written.       I beg leave to express the very
high consideration and respect I have for him, and

 LIU.     Essay  on  Agriculture,  as a Science, subdivided  into se
         parate Departments.      By W. Richardson, D.D.
 I   have often lamented that agriculture, far from being consi
 dered as a science, and treated as such, was reduced merely to a
 measure of practice, arid left in the hands of persons little quali
 fied to advance the theoretical knowledge of this useful branch
 of learning, and little disposed to improve its practice, by chan
 ging the usages to which they were most obstinately attached,
 or even to admit that their practices were capable of receiving
 improvement.
     This earliest, and most necessary of all sciences, ought, as I
 think, to be considered as consisting of three separate depart
 ments, distinct from each other ; the theoretical — the experi
 mental — and the practical.
     The first and second are at present quite absorbed by the
 third, without any prospect of emerging in their proper and di
  stinct characters.
     1 shall endeavour to describe the qualities which    I conceive
  the dormant personages representing these several departments
 ought to possess, and their respective offices.
     The theorist should be well acquainted with natural history
 in general, as well as with that of the several vegetables we are
 used to cultivate for our own consumption or that of our do
  mestic animals ; — their habits, their properties — their seasons
  of attaining perfection. — He watches the process of Nature with
  attention, and combines his general observations with those he
  has made on the particularities of each separate vegetable, and
  then speculates, a priori, on the modes of culture best suited to
  them ; and the soils best adapted to them, and likely to make
  them bring forward their produce in the greatest abundance and
  highest perfection.
     Are the suggestions of the theorist to be immediately adopted
                                                                  and

                  Essay   on  Agriculture  as a Science.         263
and     carried into practice ?    By no means ; — they must under
go the test of experiment.        Here the second department of the
agricultural school, as arranged by me, opens, and a new per
sonage is introduced.
    The experimentalist should be careful, patient, and diligent,
without prejudices or even opinions on the subjects before him :
he is to make his experiments on the very smallest scale, so that
he can diversify them without expense, and without having any
interest in their success, — failure is to him exactly the same
thing ; as information is his sole object.
    This personage adopts the ideas, and if you please the whims
of the theorist, which he is not to presume to call Utopian— he
gives them a fair and patient trial under different circumstances,
and on a small scale. Shall he discover any thing, in the slightest
degree promising, he repeats, and varies his experiments, until
he satisfies himself, either that the measure is a vain one, or that
it deserves attention.       In this latter case the experimentalist
makes his report to the agriculturists, recommends to them to
try the measure on a larger scale, and in actual practice.
     Even expense, ultimately so important, is not in an early stage
to stop proceedings; for the object immediately before the school
is to devise by what means the vegetable in their hands can be
brought to the highest degree of perfection and utility; — the ques
tion of expense comes next ; this on his diminutive scale, is no
thing to the experimentalist, — but should it threaten to be
 weighty, the ingenuity of ail parties is now to be exerted to
find succedanea; and a knowledge of the subject being acquired,
 measures may be devised which will attain the object by more
 accessible means.
     The third character in the drama is the practical agriculturist,
 of whom I complain that he has taken upon himself the whole
 three characters I mentioned : He treats the theorist with super
 cilious contempt, as presuming to obtrude his wild speculations
 into a department of which he considers himself as complete
 master.
     Hence improvements are discouraged, and discoveries that
 might have proved useful are nipped in the bud.
     The second character I wish to introduce does not yet exist ;
 whence it comes that discoveries which have been forced into
 attention rarely meet with a fair trial : they are encountered by
 the practical fanner with prejudice, and even with jealousy; they
 are considered as obtrusions ; and treated as uninvited, unwel
  come strangers.
      It is some thirty years since Dr. Lettsom brought mangel wur-

use and value       of that excellent root : yet the English agriculturists,
though so fond        of house feeding, let it slip through their fmgers :
and   if,     after  lapse of many years, they have at last become sen
                       a
sible of its value,      was owing to the strenuous interference of

of this importaut vegetable into Ireland; and                am proud of       1
having   been   an active  instrument   under   her  ladyship, who was
so good as for years to supply      me  with seed.
    Sometimes, indeed, the practical farmer persuades himself
that he has assumed the character of the experimentalist, and
tells us he has made the experiment — that             he has cultivated
                                                            ;            is,
a field       in
               particular way.

    Hence agriculture, as a science,          at a stand — the present
                                                            is                 ;
possessor of the field, perfectly satisfied with his own attainments,
and in high admiration of his own practices (often very good),
does not admit improvement to be necessary, and indignantly
rejects any innovation.

 by  the ridicule which      witty author throws on the agricultural
projectors of his day.
    It   just a century since Swift made a bitter attack on the
         is
Royal Society, which he describes as           set     projectors, lately
                                                                 a       of
incorporated               by
                  royal patent.
    It   not for me to defend this respectable body: a century
         is
has intervened since this wanton attack was made upon them,
and their merits or demerits are best appreciated     their inter                  by
mediate proceedings and transactions.
   My object in referring to the passage in Swift's Laputa,      to                       is
throw light on the arrangement       have made    the agricultural
                                                      I                   in
science, and to afford proof of its propriety.
   Swift says, " the professors contrive new rules and methods
of agriculture — new instruments and tools all the fruits of the     ;
earth shall come to maturity, at whatever season we think fit to
choose, and increase an hundred-fold more than they do at pre
sent."
  He states            " the
                     result of all this to be, that none of. these pro
jects are yet brought to perfection, and in the meantime the whole
 country lies miserably waste;                    by
                                     all which, instead of being dis
couraged, they are fifty times more bent on prosecuting their
schemes."
   Admitting this to be     fair account of the facts in Swift's day,
                                          a

(which I much doubt,) 'he picture he draws is a necessary result
of his own statements, from which we can infer,
    That in his time projectors were wild   and speculative — prac
tical agriculturists not    quite so averse from innovations as at
present, but equally tenacious of their practices when once
adopted.
    The whole mischief (admitting it to have existed) obviously
arose from Swift's having omitted a personage in the agricultural
drama,      forming a coalition between the wild theorist and
positive practical farmer ; omitting the intermediate personage,
the experimentalist, who would have protected them both from
mischief, suppressing the extravagancies of the projector, and
paying every attention to his suggestions that bore the test of
experiment ; and suffering nothing to pass into practice, which
did not afford a reasonable prospect of advancing the agricul
tural science, and multiplying the benefits derived from it.
    Let us try two or three agricultural questions by the test of
the arrangement I have suggested, and we shall see what pro
gress the science has made without them, and to what state it
probably would have advanced, had they been adopted.
    I commence with the gramina,a branch of agriculture to which
 for twenty years I have paid considerable attention, and which,
 for these last ten, I have considered as my peculiar department.
    The great importance to us of grassy produce is obvious ;
 and nature has been very liberal to us in that line — she has given
 us (as botanists tell us) one hundred and fifty varieties to supply
 the wants of our cattle, and to exercise our ingenuity in disco
 vering their uses and developing their properties.
    What use has the agriculturist derived from this copious stock?
 But a solitary one. — He has discovered that rye grass when sown
 with clover makes an excellent mixture; into further practice
 his knowledge does not carry him: and yet in dogged confidence
 he turns a deaf ear to any suggestions for increasing his stock
 of grasses, or advancing his knowledge on their subject.
     What would probably have been the result, had agriculture
  been distributed into the three departments I have supposed,
  and the gramina had passed through the hands of the theorist
  and experimentalist, before they reached the practical farmer?
     The theorist, speculating a priori, would have considered what
  were the. properties most likely to give value to grass, and by
  which it would be made most useful to our cattle: he would
  soon have perceived that three were prominent — earliness — lux
  uriance — and quick powers of reproduction after being cut or
  eaten down ; he would have desired the experimentalist to make
  many small plots, and to compare the different grasses in these
  several points of view.
                                                                 The

  The experimentalist         would soon have discovered that the
grasses possessing     all, or the majority of these valuable .qualities,
were very few in number, and that rye-grass was not among them.
    When I cease to generalize, I shall give a small essay on the
grasses worth cultivation,       having ascertained their comparative
values, after much pains, and with great accuracy.
    The miserable ignorance of the practical agriculturists on the
subject of the gramina is easily accounted for ; they have con
signed the task of instructing them on all rural subjects to two
descriptions of persons — the Grub-street writers, who, without
ever having cultivated or perhaps seen a farm, maintain them
selves by furnishing        agricultural   magazines and newspapers
with essays on such subjects as their employers point out, con
ceiving them to be popular at the time.
    The second description of public instructors in the agricultural
line are, the seed- and nursery-men, who, having their goods
to dispose of, take the opportunity of displaying their own great
knowledge, and of puffing theirsaleablecommodities;        these gentry
 often publish agricultural volumes, which they find a very lucra
 tive trade, as the English buy every thing in that line, conceiv
 ing they are purchasing information.
    The ignorance of these charlatans is scarcely credible, nor is
it easy to tell to what mischief it may have led ; both the seeds
 men and the books of their predecessors have recipes, nos
 trums, stating mixtures of eight or nine different species of grass,
 which t jay advise agriculturists to throw together in certain
 proportions of the seeds, and then to sow one mixture for mea
 dow, another for pasture.
    An examination of these lists by any one who understands the
 natural history and qualities of the several grasses, will instantly
 discover the mischievous ignorance of these quacks.
    I should not have spoken so boldly on this subject, had I not
 evidence under the hands of the first seeds-men in London to
 eonfirm what I say. — It is common for improving gentlemen to
 desire their seeds-men to send them such a mixture of grass seed
 as will suit their soil.    The order is instantly complied with, and
 the list established by the bill. I answer for      it,
                                                      whoever consults
 his  bill for this list, will find many worthless grasses, of incom
 patible periods; and that he will find tall oat grass, avena
 elutior, recommended, and sent to him.
     Now tall oat grass        is   byfar the most mischievous of the
 squitch tribe;   it  has small bulbous roots like the crocus, and          is
 known in this country           by the names of purl grass and knot
 squitch;   it   is reprobated        by
                                      our farmers as one of our most
 troublesome weeds.
    Such is    the style of instruction we receive from the present
                                                                 agricultural

                   Essay on Agriculture as a Science.                        267
agricultural authorities ; and so long as that task is left in such
unhappy hands, it is no wonder that our knowledge of any par
ticular branch of this useful science should be sadly limited ; or
that Sir Humphry Davy should complain, that our acquaintance
with the gram ina should be confmed to two species*.
    Better prospects are now opening ; a revolution has fortunately
taken place; — philosophy supported by science has stepped for
ward, and the Board of Agriculture, with its able chemical lec
 turer, have rescued the gramina at least from the hands of
 mercenary ignorance.
    This unexpected irruption of science into the peaceful and
productive domain of these indefatigable scribblers has excited
no small uneasiness in Grub-street; one of the gentlemen, whose
name is perpetually occurring in almost every agricultural publi
cation, shows the alarm that school has taken, at the dangerous
invasion of their territories.         He says:
    "  1 am far from wishing to depreciate the use of science, as
directed to the improvement of agriculture ; but the pleasure,
the delight there is in studying Nature through these spectacles,
is greater than its benefit."
   "   All that science has done to improve our knowledge of the
value of the grasses as yet, consists in showing which affords the
greater proportion of saccharum: — with those who sing the
praises of analysis, the burthen of the song is saccharum."
   " Can it be reasonably said that the choice of rye-grass, as a
separate grass, was the result of accident?                 This 'tett that is
quoted    from   Sir  Humphry Davy         is not Gospel." Again.
    " This account is miserable, because it is not true ; and the
hasty expressions of great men ought to be more carefully re
pressed, as they are the more widely diffused."
    I know not any question in rural practice that more requires
the interference of the scientific theorist than the proper period
for mowing, nor any point upon which the practical farmer is
more ignorant or more opinionated — he prides himself on having
saved his hay before others, and boasts of its fragrance and tea
like verdure.
    The theorist, acquainted with natural history, would have told
him that the juices of all vegetables attain their greatest per-
   * Sir Humphry Davy admits two varieties to be in use ; but the second,

  fection in their inflorescence — that it is at this period alone all
  extracts from vegetable substances are taken : and as in the
  case of hay the whole vegetable is preserved, it is of great im
  portance that it should be mowed in its highest state of perfection,
  that is, when the predominant varieties of grass are in flower.
     The practical farmer knows nothing of all this: he has his own
  rules for deciding on maturity, and generally cuts his crop be
  fore either the cocksfoot or the rye-grass (the two earliest of
  our predominant grasses) are in flower.

     Was the arrangement    I recommend adopted, many agricultural
 questions of much importance would receive speedy solutions. —
  That of the proper seasons for sowing our several grains has
 been much agitated.
     Upon this question the theorist would pronounce generally,
 that agricultural policy directed the season for sowing each ve
 getable, to be so chosen, that        might remain above ground in
                                      it
 the very best portion of the year, neither exposed unnecessarily
 to late frosts in its tender state, nor to premature winter seve
 rities when ripening its seed.
     Hence the season for sowing each vegetable should be deter
 mined       by
             the interval between the seed and the sickle, which
 Nature has assigned to each species, corresponding with the
 period of gestation in animals, and unalterably fixed at the time
 of their original formation.       Upon this principle    it  obvious
                                                                is
 that the vegetables of slowest growth should be sown first, while
 those of quicker progress should be delayed longer.
     The question has now reached the experimentalist, who will
probably sow many varieties in distinct plots, on the same day;
and    by accurately observing their times of ripening will make
himself acquainted with their respective periods.
     What recommend here as experiment,
            I                                   is the actual practice
in Egypt, where they sow all their grains, of whatever species, on
the same day, that    is,  the first moment the retreat of the Nile
gives them access to their land, just relieved from its annual iiv-
ttndation.
                                                                   We

       We  have  Scriptural authority for the result, marking  the pro
gress each separate grain had made in the same time.
      Moses tells us that at the time of a particular event,      " the
barley was in the ear, and the flax was boiled, but the wheat and
the rye were not grown up."
     The experimentalist will now diversify his trials; and by sow
ing the same grain at different times. in many small plots, he
will soon be able to determine, how far, for the security of the
young tendril, he can delay sowing, without throwing the mature
plant into a season unfit for ripening its seed.
      It has been made a question — Whether in choosing our corn
for seed, we should choose our weightiest pickle, or whether -the
smaller and lighter might not answer just as well ; — in other
words : From which side of our winnowing heap are we to take
our seed — the windward — or the leeward ? The fuller, plumper
and larger grain, will not cover so much ground as the smaller,
 and is also of higher price; hence by sowing the smaller and
 lighter grain, we should save considerably;           and Sir Joseph
 Banks     is of opinion  we may safely   take  our seed  from the lee
 ward side of the heap.
      Was the question brought before the agricultural school, ar
 ranged as I suppose ; — the theorist would tell us that the farina
 constitutes the whole value of the corn ; that this portion of the
 vegetable forms no part of the organic construction, has no con
 nexion with the vital principle of the germ, but is merely a mass
 of unorganized matter, provided by Nature for the sustenance
 of the nascent plant, until by its roots it can extract food for it
 self ; — that the farina in vegetables corresponds with the yolk
 of the egg in oviparous animals.
      Now we observe that in every thing connected with the pre
 servation of species, Nature is not only liberal, but generally
  profuse, and (no doubt to provide against difficulties) often re
  dundant — besides, the provision was made when the vegetable
  tribe was left to propagate itself, without any of the facilities
  devised by man, which he now gives to assist vegetation and
  increase produce.
       More farina, it is obvious, would be required under the hard
  ships of a state of nature ; and a greater quantity will be formed
  under cultivation, as animals fostered by man acquire a degree
  of obesity which they never reach in a state of nature.          Thus
  it appears, the quantity of farina is increased, and the expendi
   ture of it diminished ; of course it is highly probable, we may
   with safety avail ourselves of the redundance; that is, sow the
   lighter, and consume the weightier grain.
       The question is now brought before the experimentalist, and
   one of the lightest he has to encounter ; he need only sow a few
                                                                   small

small plots with seeds taken from the opposite sides of the win
nowing heap, and by a careful comparative view of the crops
when ripe, he will be able to pronounce upon the safety of the
measure, and by attention he will soon discover what he will
gain by pursuing it.
   The preservation of the vigour of our soils, and the repara
tion of the waste they sustain by our perpetual call upon them
for crops, and consequent loosening of their texture, by over

turist, admits rest to be indispensably necessary, and recom
mends two successive crops of grass.
   To make that rest as effective as possible, let us speculate             a

LIV. Extract from         a Memoir on the Combinations          of Phos
                          phorus with Oxygen.
 Read to    the  French Academy       of Sciences on the    1st and lath
                 of July 1S16.        By M. Dulokg*.
The       chief object of this paper is to prove that there are at
least four distinct acids, formed by the combination of phos
 phorus with oxygen.          The acid with the minimum of oxvgen,
which I intend to call hypophosphomis acid, is produced by the
reaction of water on the alkaline phosphurets.           When the latter
 are properly prepared, there results from the decomposition which
 they make the water undergo, phosphorated hydrogen gas in
variable proportions, and two acids which neutralize precisely
the base of the phosphuret.        One of these acids is the phosphoric
acid, and the other is the hypophosphorous acid.           By employing
the phosphuret of barytes we may obtain very easily the latter
 acid in its state of purity. For this purpose it is sufficient to
 separate by the filter the insoluble phosphate from the water
 which holds in solution the hypophosphite of barytes, and to
 precipitate the base of this salt by an adequate quantity of sul
 phuric acid.     The acid solution which remains may be concen
  trated by evaporation ; — pure water only is extricated, and we
  obtain a viscous liquid strongly acid and uncrystallizable.        By 3
 stronger heat we decompose it : phosphuretted hydrogen gas
 is developed, a little phosphorus is sublimed, and phosphoric acid
  remains in the retort, partly combined with the glass.             The
  hypophosphorous acid acts, in general, as a very energetic de-
  oxidant.
      The hypophosphites are remarkable by their extreme solubi
  lity. None are insoluble ; those of barytes and of strontian even
  crvstallize with great difficulty ; those of potash, soda, and am
 monia are soluble, in all proportions, in highly rectified alcohol.
  That of potash is much more deliquescent than the muriate of
  lime : they absorb slowly the oxygen of the air, and become
  acid : they are decomposed by the action of heat, giving the
  same products with the hypophosphorous acid.
      We cannot effect the analysis of this acid by direct means,
  since none of its combinations can be obtained in the dry state.
   In order to ascertain its proportions, I transformed an indeter
   minate quantity of it into phosphoric acid by means of chlore.
   The quantity of chlore employed to produce this effect, and the
   weight of the phosphoric acid which results from it being known,
   as well as the proportions of the latter acid, it is evident we have
   all that is wanted to resolve the question.        This analysis being

 272                    Extract from a Memoir
 very complex, and resting on a great number of data deduced
 from experiments, we cannot expect from it a perfect exactitude.,
 I found by this process, that the hvpophosphorous acid was formed
 of 100 phosphorus, and 36 3 of oxygen: but according to the
 composition of the phosphoric acid, which may be known with
 the utmost precision, the number 37'44, which is the three-
 tenths of the oxvgen contained in this acid, seems to be nearer
 the truth. According to this, the hvpophosphorous acid must
 be composed      of :
                       Phosphorus      . .  72-75—100
                       Oxygen          . .  27-25—37-44.
                                            100
     These    results are calculated upon the hypothesis that the
  hypophosphorous acid is a binary combination; but we may
 entertain doubts on this method of regarding its nature, and
 there are even strong reasons for believing that it is a triple
  compound of oxygen, hydrogen, and phosphorus, forming a new
  species of hydracid.       This is a question which I shall, by and
 by,
   "   attempt   to resolve.
     The acid which is immediately above the latter, results from
 the decomposition of the chlorure of phosphorus at the mini
 mum, by wafer : it is to Sir H. Davy that we are indebted for
 this discovery.      We obtain this acid perfectly pure by evaporat
 ing in a proper manner the water in which the decomposition of
 the chlorure has been effected.         The whole of the muriatic acid
 is disengaged, and, upon cooling, the acid crystallizes.      It seems
 proper    to  preserve  to  this  substance the  name  of phosphorous
 acid, which has been hitherto given to the product, from the
 slow combustion of phosphorus, the nature of which, as we shall
 soon see, does not agree with such a denomination.
     The true phosphites have not yet been described: their solu
 bility is in general much less than that of the hydrophosphites.
 The phosphite of potash is nevertheless very deliquescent, un-
 crystallizable, but insoluble in alcohol.       Those of soda and of
 ammonia are also very soluble in water:        The former crystallizes
 in rhomboids approaching to the cube.           All the rest are little
soluble in water : those of barytes, strontian, and lime crystallize
by spontaneous evaporation ; but if we wish to concentrate their
solutions by heat, a division is made in the elements of the salt
a precipitate is formed composed of small crystals, similar to the
acetate of mercury: — these are salts with excess of base, abso
lutely insoluble in water.        There remains in solution a salt with
excess of acid, which crystallizes with more difficulty.           Thus
there exist surphosphites, subphosphites,and neutral phosphites.
     The phenomena presented by the calcination of the phos
                                                                 phites

        on the Combinations    of Phosphorus     iv'ith Oxygen.      273
phites are nearly the same with those of which we have spoken
in treating of the hypophosphites.
    I have analysed phosphorous acid, of which Sir H. Davy had
already given the proportions, to ascertain how much of chlore
the phosphorus absorhs in order to pass to the state of chlorure
at the minimum.       My results do not differ sensibly from his. I
have found by this means that the phosphorous acid is formed
of               Phosphorus        ..       57-18 — 100
                  Oxygen    ..      ..      42-82—74-88
                                           100
    Hence it follows that the oxygen of the hypophosphorous acid
is to that of the phosphorous acid as 1 : 2.
    The acid produced by the slow combustion of the phosphorus
in the air, to which several phenomena may be referred, is ne
vertheless very little known.      It differs from the foregoing not
only by its proportions, but also by its nature.         It is not'com-
bined in the way it is with the oxides.         The salts which have
been described heretofore by the appellation of phosphites are
not   peculiar salts ; they are either phosphates, or more fre
quently a mixture of phosphates and phosphites.
    Ought we to consider this substance as a simple mixture of
phosphoric and phosphorous acids ?          Sir H. Davy merely makes
this assertion, but without any proofs.       I do not think, however,
that we can admit this idea ; — for, why should the conversion of
the phosphorous acid into phosphoric acid stop at a certain
point of time ? — wherefore should we find constantly in this
substance the same proportions of oxygen and phosphorus ?              If
its formation took place in a rapid manner, we might con
clude that some particles of phosphorous acid escaped the com
bustion ; but the tediousness of the process of obtaining it ex
cludes all idea of an incomplete combination.
    We might also suppose that the oxygen of this acid, forming
a binary combination with the phosphorus, is unequally divided
between two parts of the radical by the action of the bases, and
that there would result from this division phosphorous acid and
phosphoric acid : but it seems much more probable that these
 acids, even before the action of the oxides, are already com
pletely formed arid combined with each other, like the elements
 of a salt.    It is by adopting this last opinion that I intend to
 call it phosphatic acid; an appellation which reminds us that
this acid has some analogy with the phosphates in its mode of
 composition.
    M. Thenard has found by direct means that the phosphatic
 acid ought to be formed of 100 parts of phosphorus and 1 10-4
oxygen.     I obtained 109 by a different method. Neither of

 these numbers is found in a simple ratio with that of the oxygen
 of the phosphoric acid. The simple ratio which they approach
the nearest is that of 9 : 10, which will suppose 1 1 2* 4 of oxy
gen in the phosphatic acid.            Although the difference between
 the calculation and the observation is as much as two centiemes,
 I think it very probable, for other reasons about to be explained,
 that these two acids are really in this proportion; and this is-
what I purpose, besides, to verify directly in another manner.
     It must be observed on this subject, that when, in a series of
 binary compounds formed by the same elements, there are two
very much alke, that which is not in a simple relation with the
 others ought to be considered as a combination of two more
 simple compounds.          It is absolutely indispensable to admit this
 idea, if we wish to preserve the theory of chemical proportions
 in all its simplicity: and this is happily what experience con
 firms in an evident manner.            It is thus, for example, that if we
 wished to regard the three oxides of iron as primary combina
 tions, we must admit at least six molecules of oxygen in the in
 ferior oxide, and at least nine in the oxide at the maximum                     j
 for the quantities of oxygen contained in these three oxides are
 as the numbers C, 8, and 9 : but admitting that the intermediary
 oxide is formed of two molecules of red oxide and one molecule
 of oxide at the minimum, we are only obliged to suppose that
 there are two molecules of oxygen in the oxide at the minimum,
 and three in the oxide at the maximum.                   This ceases to be a
pure supposition       when     we   observe   the division      into red oxide
 and protoxide, which the deutoxide of iron presents in almost
 all experiments *.
     The exact determination         of the proportions of the phosphoric
 acid was indispensable for the analysis of the preceding acids ;
 and the discordance of the results obtained hitherto by chemists
equally expert, imposed upon me the necessity of searching for
the causes of error which might exist in the processes resorted
to, and to employ others which should be beyond all suspicion.
     I examined in the first place the process of the acidification
of phosphorus by the nitric acid, and I saw that it did not merit
    * The second number of the Journal of the Royal Institution of London,
which did not appear untii after my paper was read, contains an extract from,
or rather a severe criticism on, a work written in Swedish by M. Berzelius,
in which we find an explanation similar to that which        I give here.  It is «v
great satisfaction to me to have coincided with a man of talent so distin
guished. Although I regard this opinion as very probable,           I do not pre
tend however that it cannot be combated.          But it is not with the ironical,
injurious and offensive tone which reigns in the whole of the article just
mentioned, that we ought to attack labours the whole object of which is
an inquiry after truth.    If this kind of criticism is once introduced iato
the sciences, their progress will be greatly retarded..
                                                                              anv

any confidence.      We obtain results mnch more constant by sub
stituting for the pure phosphorus in the same experiment a
metallic phosphuret, the proportions of which may be determined
very exactly by synthesis, when it is prepared in the way I have
described.      By acidifying the phosphorus by the action of the
chlore in contact with the water, and determining the quantity of
chlore employed for this purpose, we may also attain very satis
factory results.     Finally, on examining by synthesis the pro
portions of the chlorure of phosphorus at the maximum which
corresponds with the phosphoric acid, we may attain very great
precision.     Sir H. Davy had already employed this last method.
Our results were so different, that I at first suspected there was
some error on my part; but having constantly obtained the same
numbers, 1 regard the following proportions as very near the
truth. Chlorure at the maximum:
             Phosphorus         ..       ..     15*4 — 100
             Chlore             ..       ..     84-6—549-1
                                               100
     Hence phosphoric acid    :
             Phosphorus                         44-48—100
             Oxygen             ,               55-52—124-8
                                               100
     On comparing the analysis of the phosphorous acid which we
 have given above, with that of the phosphoric acid, we see that
 the quantities of oxygen in these two acids are in the ratio of
 3 : 5, instead of 1 : 2 as Sir H. Davy has indicated.
     According to the series of the combinations of the phosphorus
 with the oxygen, we are well founded in admitting that the
 phosphoric acid is formed of two atoms of phosphorus and five
 atoms of oxygen.        On this supposition, and representing the
 oxygen by 10, the relative weight of the atom of phosphorus will
  be 20-03 ; that of the phosphoric acid = 90-06, &c.
     1 also directed my attention, and even during a very long time,
  to the analysis of the phosphates, in order to discover the laws
  of composition of those salts. M. Berzelius, from the analysis
  of two phosphates only, has concluded that the oxygen of the
  acid is double that of the base ; but the salts which he has ex
  amined are certainly not neutral salts.      I have analysed a great
  number of phosphates, and I am not yet able to explain all the
  variations which I met with in some species.        I adhered to the
  composition of the phosphates, in order to discover that of the
  phosphites and hypophosphites ; the comparison of the propor
  tions of those different salts being very interesting in point of

theory.    This labour not being yet terminated, I shall confine
myself for the present to saying,
    1. That the neutral phosphites are changed into phosphates
without ceasing to be neutral, as M. Gay-Lussac had already
observed.
    2. That the neutral hypophosphites become acid phosphates.
    3. That the phosphoric acid strongly calcined contains a
quantity of water, the oxygen of which is as the third part as                              is-
 the case in some phosphates.
   4. That the metallic phosphurets obtained                the process      by
which   I have indicated, correspond with the protoxides soluble
in the acids; that bypassing the phosphorus to the state of
phosphoric acid, and the metal to the state of protoxide, there
results   aneutral phosphate, in which the oxygen of the acid                              is
to the oxygen of the base           :

                                   :
   5. That the phosphites and the phosphates have, with the
nitrites and nitrates,     very great analogy as to proportions; — that
                               a
the same analogy has been already remarked in the proportions*
of the acids with      base of phosphorus and azote.

because the party that has ostensibly left the field, retires as                           if

   though repeatedly corrected, and reminded of his injustice to the
   author, persists in urging his vernacular proof s, that Shakespear
   is a mere playwright, destitute of genius and truth in every plot
   and character.      Had the anti-cosmologist understood but a lit
    tle of the language in which the cosmogony is written, the pages
   of the Philosophical Magazine never would have been the record
   of the following unphilosophical conclusion : ' Neither forest
   trees, shrubs, nor lichens come under the description of grass,
   seed-br-aring herbs, or fruit-trees'     In this reflection he relies
   upon the common version, which makes NET! a generic noun,
   contrary to the analogy of the Genesis : the terms that charac
   terize organized beings, except where the rational species is de
  signated, are all general.        The eleventh verse literally runs
   thus: ' God said, Let the earth shoot forth the vegetable (tWin
  NttTf V^Nn), the herb making seed, the tree producing fruit
  for its kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.'      The ob
  jection that, if this account were fact, wc should have no forest -
  trees, is extremely vulgar ; as if the oak and the beech came not
*
  under the denomination of ' fruit-bearing trees,' merely because
  their mast and acorns are never found among the nuts and
   oranges, grapes and nectarines, that decorate the dtssert-tab)c.
       The inference, so pertinaciously defended, — that Moses has
   confined the existence of the aquatic animals to the fifth day, — is
   equally unfortunate.     Moses informs us that, at the commence
   ment of this period, ' God said, Let the waters bring forth abun
   dantly the moving creature that hath life.' Gen. chap. i. ver. 20.
   The author of the Cosmogony never designed here to be under
   stood as if no species of animated beings had before existed.
   His language is very different from that in which he describes
I
   the first production of land animals. — We have the authority of
   Moses himself, in another instance, for the import of his lan
   guage in the present ease.
       In the following passage (Exod. chap. viii. ver. 3.) the mode of
  expression is here precisely the same with that above mentioned
  in the Genesis: 4 The river shall bring forth frogs abundantly .'
  Would it not be a monstrous absurdity to argue from this pass
  age that, because Moses says nothing of their previous existence,
   therefore there must have been no frogs in the Nile before this
  event? though it would be wry difficult perhaps to prove the
  fact.     But as there eertainly were frogs in Egypt before this
  period ; so, if the same words have the same meaning, there were
  * living creatures' in the waters previous to the
                                                    fifth day; though
   till then they did not so abundantly exist. Besides, a physical
  cause can be assigned for the peculiar expression Moses «ses,
   which also contains a sufficient reason for the aquatic animals
  remaining unnoticed till this period.       The waters had hitherto
                                  S 3                              been

been so highly impregnated with the earths, that stratum super
stratum were so rapidly deposited that they proved the grave
rather than permanent habitations for their tenants. Hence many
of the species perished entirely, and others were vastly dimi
nished.     But in the fifth period the water, being sufficiently
purified by immense depositions, not only permitted the more
perfect orders of aquatic animals to exist, -but the Creator re
plenished the ocean with an increased number of inferior inha
bitants suited to the improved state of their element.

     LVI.   A new     View   of  Vegetable' Life.   m By Mrs. Agnes
                                 Ibbetson.
                              To  Mr.  Tilloch.
 Sir, — The very curious fact I have             now to exhibit throws
 (I think) a new light on vegetable life,         perfectly confirms the
 truth   of  all 1  have  hitherto  shown   of  the  history of their ge
 neral formation, and renders      the commencement conformable to
 those universal laws which appear to be established not only in
 the vegetable, but in the animal and mineral world ; as I shall
 show at the conclusion of this letter.
     In my last I depicted the curious manner in which the flowers
 are developed in the interior, both in trees and herbaceous plants,
 the year they are completed at the exterior of the vegetable.
 But I am now authorized to suppose that there is a prior for
 mation, both of leaves and flowers, prior to that in which they
 are collected and enlarged in the middle of the plant.             In the
 first I wa3 able to follow the formation in a regular series, till
 they appeared opening into flower, and making their way out of
 the vegetable through the buds in the usual manner; but the
  buds in this case are really the vehicles for completing and send
  ing out the bunches of flowers and leaves, and not (as it was
  supposed) the part tn which they are formed: — yet to trace iu
  a series what I am now going to show, is impossible, as it will
  not admit of it.     I shall, however, give an exact account of the
  whole process, and the consequences that must (I think) result
  from such a formation.
      Having cut an extremely thin specimen of the wood of the
  cupressus longitudinally, and placed it in my slider, under my
  best microscope (though using very low powers) I was surprised
  to see a sort of running pattern of leaves and Jloiuers adorning
  every two or three stripes of the wood, and now and then col
                                                                   lecting

 lecting in thicker patterns, when the lancet, in passing over the
 raised part, pushed them up together, aggregating their numbers.
 See fig. 1, PI. No. 3. [Plate IV.]
    After examining many different cuttings, I got a fresh branch
 of the elm, the beech, the oak, the plane, and rose, and cut
 specimens from each : — still the same object was visible, though
 arranged not exactly in the same manner, yet in stripes of
 flowers.    Convinced I was not mistaken, I made a bold effort at
 proving the fact to others, assured that if Sir William Herschel
 (who happened to be here) saw           it,
                                         no one would hazard the con
 tradicting a   sight   whose   perfection was so well acknowledged,
 ora   judgement      so well matured, though they constantly dis
puted mine.     I  requested him, therefore, to prove the fact and           :
with the generosity and good-nature for which he                   so much
                                                                   is
loved, he came and examined              it
                                          directly   and said, he saw
                                                     ;                            it
most plainly.   I    then showed him an horizontal piece, in which
he also saw the same appearance of leaves and flowers (see fig. 6).
Assured therefore     it was   atruth    the first specimen was allowed
                                         ;

that it   had thrown off many white and double lines, between

ture does, is to render each individual part less distinct : still,
however, they were sufficiently so, to be perfectly perceptible to
Sir William Herschel, who said he thought there could be wo
doubt that it was the continuation of vegetat ion on the glass.
This was indeed a great matter gained, especially when so,
witnessed.     Sir William Herschel also did me the honour to see
the first specimen.
    Fig. 2 was the spoiled piece, which had however increased to
fig. 3,   Fig. 4 was one of the specimens Sir William examined,
which was increased in three days to fig. 5; and another which I
have not added, fearful of augmenting too much the number of
specimens.      Indeed the collection of flowers on the glass was
evidence sufficient of the fact; for no power but their own could
place them there.      The white specimen might be, and ivas laid
on the glass; but the rest could not be either taken off or put
on, unhurt, without Nature's help.
   On further examination I found that, if I watched with great
exactness, drops of moisture were to be seen ejected from the
many cut ends of the line of life ; and that when the more dimi
nutive lines of that part increased in length, wherever the liquid
hud fallen, and the double line also passed through it, bunches
of flowers had protruded, till they became either wreaths or
bouquets, running and growing in a fanciful manner as long as
the moisture would sustain or assist in forming them ; some-,
times even more than a week.        It could no longer be a doubts
ful fact; for on examining the talcs and glasses I found them
covered with different beautiful patterns, which had proceeded
from all the specimens accidentally thrown on the surface ; and
so opposite is the jelly-like appearance of the new propagation,
to the white one presented to examination, that it is not possible
to mistake them, or to take one for the other: the lines, indeed,
are always white, but the flowers and leaves, I find, require
more than a fortnight to become so: and such is the glutinous
power with which they stick to the glass, that nothing but soap
and sand can eradicate them ; nay, even a knife is sometimes
required to scrape the wreaths off, as they absolutely almost
indent the talc : yet so high do they lie above the surface, from
the quantity of leaves and flowers in the bouquets, that thev are
easily injured.    But great care should be taken that a contusion
is not made between the white lines of the increasing vegetation
and those that are formed by cracking the talc, for I have now-

might not the juices intended to form the pistil be highlv de

cessary to vegetable life, and the uncommon arts resorted to to
prevent the possibility of their meeting,                    confining them  by
.within layers of cylinders without any means of communication.
This law      so evident and universal, that
                is                                         generally the first

     If,therefore, we suppose this part of the flower presented in
fig.  1. to be a prior formation,              most probable that
                                               it       is             should                 it
be protruded in       separate slate, from the pollen and seeds.

have accordingly laid         down in this manner.
                                  it
    The corolla, pericarp, and pistil, formed the first year, and
followed the next bv the insertion of the heart of the seeds and
 the pollen    which when so far ready rise up from the root in a
                ;
different part of the stem, and after various preparations, regu
 larly to be traced from point to point, enter the pericarp, where
 the formation of the flower              complete, and where the whole

 in the open air,
    The flower-bud and leaf-bud therefore must be only intended
 for the receptacle of the unfinished flowers and leaves, the place
in   which those parts are completed, and acquire the last fmish to
 their respective forms. The flower-bud, when at last fixed in
 its proper place,        follqwed
                             is                by
                                            the flowers which were formed

 2S2                A new   View of Vegetable    Life.
 the preceding year, now entering the flower-bud for the first
 time to complete their forms ; by the heart of the seeds when
 ready, drawing themselves into the pericarp             by means of
 the line of life, with which they are tied ; and the pollen pow
 der into the stamen.       The whole then closing, till near the time
 of fructification ; when the enlarged flowers acquiring hew stalks
 (again leaving the flower-bud which falls off, being scales only)
 the flowers shoot up into perfection ; — tben the seeds fill up
 their heart, acquire their outward part ; and when the flower
 dies, they soon complete their cover, and drop into the earth.
 The leaf-hud also, by taking in the leaves, and completing their
edges and upper cuticle (being evidently an after process), and
 thus gave the idea 6f their being formed there: nay, I have rea
son to think their pabulum is also a late formation, the bark-
juice being then undoubtedly propelled into the leaf-bud.
    Thus this new discovery only more completely establishes all
the facts 1 have hitherto made known of the formation of plants,
 and confirms some of the propositions I wished to prove ; viz.
that the seeds, pollen, and flower-bud, are formed in the root: it
shows that also theflower-hid and leaf-bud are a totally different
substance from the flower and leaf; and that the account I have
before given of the passage of the flower-bud through the wood
is a real fact, and which this new discovery by no means invali
dates.     Indeed, it accounts for some trifling contradictions that
did not quite assimilate with the general plan, and for some
difficulties I could not before understand.         The first was the
earliest separation of the flower-bud and flower, when in the
root, as every author and every prejudice had taught me to seek
the flower in the flower-bud.       Now this prior formation com
pletely  clears  the whole, and shows that the flower-bud was merely
intended as a case to perfect the flower, not to commence it.
How beautiful are they now made to meet, and the flower to
enter there for the reception of its various ingredients !       In the
                                       I
second place, it showed that what took for the first commence
ment of the leaf was the weaving of the scales, and the finishing
the leaf : indeed, I never before could account for the little
branches of extremely diminutive leaves I found also in the leaf-
bud, with the loose fibres weaving other parts: the latter were
for the scales, the former the real unfinished leaves : while the
leaf-bud is certainly formed in the bark, as I have before shown.
Thus, though the whole has been discovered by detached pieces,
it all arranges itself in a perfect regular manner, and, like a cut
map, each part fits into the place appropriated for it.         If this
does not prove it true, I know not what will, since perfect con
sistency belongs to God alone : and I feel thoroughly conscious of
my inability to produce or invent such a plan.         In short, every
                                                             additional

                  A new    View      of Vegetable Life.            2S3
additional discovery, and evey new view we take, prove, that of
the form and proceedings of vegetable life we before knew
nothing; all our facts have proved false; all our conjectures
mistakes; and that we must begin by banishing every former
idea that respects the real nature of a vegetable; except the
inimitable and well observed sexual system, and the observations
of many authors on seeds, which have been really dissected.
As to the nomenclature and general arrangement of plants, and
all that part of botany, I touch not on them. — I respect them
as 1 ought, and only admire.         All this will, I fear, appear bold
language, especially    in a  woman:  but it is necessary sometimes to
be bold in the cause of truth ; and I am assured I am defending
it. That no person had ever torn down a plant for examination,
or followed a plant in the interior from day to day, and from
year to year, I am perfectly persuaded; and these progressive
steps are the only means of coming at the secrets of nature,
 and viewing the rising of its seeds from the first moment of their
 protrusion in their mother's womb, and the formation of flowers
from their beginning.        But let me not be misunderstood : — I do
not mean to say that innumerable mistakes will not be found in
 this general plan of the foundation of plants.         As I enter into
 the details, I have no doubt there will.          But I have watched
 with such carefulness, that I hope they will be few.          Hitherto
I   have been most fortunate in not discovering one gross error ;
 since I am so particular not to declare a truth till I have inves
 tigated it in so many ways, and placed it in so many different
 lights, that I hope the mistakes will not be serious at least. The
 present truth would not (but for so kind and perfect a voucher)
 have made its way to the public notice till next year.
     It is most curious, that in examining sea weeds I have also
 discovered the flowers and leaves either filling up the midrib or
 concealed between the cuticles : but they do not run from the
  root upwards, they are divided into little separate plants with a
  sort of roo/ to each. See fig. 9. the fucus bulbosus, where they
  are to be taken from the midrib by numbers, as when that is torn
  up a number fall out, and will grow on the glass as long as you
  please to supply them with drops of salt water administered with
  the fingers.    They grow also in the interior of the dulse, or
fucus     pimiatifidus ; and if the coralline is first taken off by
  scraping   it with a knife  on each side, the flowers will be plainly
  seen ; for, thin as the dulseis,   it   covered
                                          is      bya   double coralline
  and many layers of net, besides having the young plants in the
  interior. These evidently take their nutriment from the lumps
  of jelly which forms their apparent root, within which grows also
a   small piece of sea weed — the whole appearing like Mocha
  stone or Egyptian pebble,       (See fig. 8.)

284                 A new     View of Vegetable Life.
    At the beginning of this letter, I said that the curious forma
 tion just discovered, agreed with the general laws of nature in
 the mineral, as well as animal world.        But I should rather,
 perhaps,   have said " they appear  to agree*."
    I shall now explain what I mean by the assertion. — All metal*
 when first shooting carry the appearance of leaves and flowers.
 But when examined they are always to be divided into the re
 gular forms belonging to each separate met al, as octagonals, pen
 tagonals, &c. &c. though they carry the appearance of leaves
 and flowers: as is seen in the arborescent silver ore from the
 mines of Potosi; — in the common iron ore, when combined with
 salt, at Dawlish; — in the arborescent copper, and zinc tree.
 But they are all (as I said) to be reduced into their primitive
forms, and it is merely by their diminutive size, and their at
 traction for each other, that they carry the appearance of a
branch.
   But in animal life by what principle are they made to receive
the same form ?       I have seen the scale of a beetle when broken,
recover and renew itself by the same means, forming branches
thicker and thicker, till the whole became one mass ; yet never
growing beyond the boundary line given                 it,

scope, till the whole scale was completed and restored to its per

particles; and also how metals dissolved     byand incorporated with the sa-

earths, and divisible into the forms that sort of lime adopts.

    Still the vegetable draws its source from a totally different
power, from the vitality of that line on which its life and ex
istence depend.     When the wing of the        grew,          fly

from the juice, and began where the juice fell, and joined itself
to the wing afterwards.      But the vegetable requires two things,
the double line and the liquid, without which       cannot increase: it
for  I have watched with care where the juice was when no line
came to     it,
              and    evaporated without any increase
                         it                                    there      ;    it   is

 I    am now going to undertake the leaf and flower-bud. — Va
rious dissections will be placed before the public, which delinea

it  impossible for the most unbelieving really to doubt the facta
I  have shown.      shall pursue the inquiry in

out into leaf and flower; — ascertaining every three or four days
the contents, and taking drawings of them every week.              For
this purpose,     shall fix on the ash, the lime, and the oak.

LVII.     On   Sir Humphry Davy's Snfe-lamp, and                   on Flame.
                         By J. Murray, M.D.
                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —    It   has always been my most anxious wish to combat
 whatever doubts I may have found to exist on the perfect secu
 rity held out to the miner by the continued use of Sir Humphry
 Davy's safe-lamp.       I have cheerfully descended into the abysses
 of the mine to exhibit my unshaken confidence in, and entire
 conviction of, its safety.
    That on its introduction prejudice did exist, cannot be denied;
 but this, the offspring of ignorance, was soon dispelled by the
 beam of truth.       It is difficult to believe that any one nurtured
 in the paths of science can for a moment honestly doubt of the
 sufficiency of the security.       Let them with me enter the mine,
 that we may rejoice together.
    The extraordinary phienomena presented by this discovery
 were on their announcement rashly questioned, and I am glad
 of it. — " Vires acquirit eundo." The most sublime discoveries
 that have adorned the annals of science have had their ordeal to
 pass, and they have risen with livelier loveliness from the cruci
 ble of trial.
     In my experiments in the mine I have ventured to place
 the lamp in the jet of a blower: — this would seem to contradict
 the experiments of Mr. Holmes.                In the Dee Bank Colliery,
 when    the  fire-damp     was   flaming   in   the cylinder, I projected
 against it a quantity of that highly inflammable powder called
 lycopodium; but even this had no other effect than to increase
 the intensity of light. Like an enraged and imprisoned tiger,
 it simply gratified the admiring eye with the form it presented
 and beauty of its appearance.             With this shield I could en
 counter the fire-damp in its most terrific form : and when my
 services in the cause of humanity are demanded, I think I shall
                                                                           not

                                  and on Flame.                    287
not l>e found to shrink from the requirement ; — and it would
rest lightly on me, for the duty will ever please.
    Mr. Holmes says that the sentiment excited in my mind by
the sublime discovery, should have been applied to Dr. Reid
Cianny, and not to Sir H. Davy. My former opinion, however,
remains unchanged.          Much as I approve Dr. C's exertions iu
the good cause , surely it will not be said that his invention is at
all comparable with the instrument projected by Sir H. Davy,
for the operations of mining. I would not willingly offend Dr. C.
by hazarding any thing which would detract from its merits —
" valeat quantum valere potest '" — and yet I must, in deference
 to Mr. Holmes's opinion, still say, I feel convinced that Dr.
Clanny's lamp and the beautiful and perfect instrument of Sir
H. Davy ought not to be associated together, nor ever mentioned
at the same time. I cannot otherwise appreciate the former. —
Independent and essentially distinct, it is unfair to support its
pretension by an endeavour to weaken the suffrages so honestly
won by its distinguished author Sir Humphry Davy,— a discovery
beautifully illustrative of his ingenuity and unwearied persever
ance and assiduity.        I heartily accord with Mr. Children, that
it is not novelty, a boyish plaything, which has won our ad
miration.      That it will be permanent too, I with this excellent
chemist firmly believe; and may hazard, without the prophetic
eye, to pronounce, that it will live to the honour of its discoverer,
when we who now exist shall sleep with our fathers; and, to use
 Sir H's own language, " it will be illustrated by discussion, and
be exalted by time."         It is indeed not novelty that attracts our
regard : we are arrested by a discovery as extraordinary as it        is-
important.       Itpoints to humanity for its object, and our hopes
               and     the tone of our exultation we will remember
                      It in
beat high    ;
the discoverer.         attaches the signet of experience, and we are
satisfied. — What would we have more than this?
    We may now fearlessly approach the prison which confines
the flame of the fire-damp, wondering at its greatness, and con
fessing our .astonishment at the simple means           which its mighty
                                                       by
energies   are subdued   and   made   obedient to our wants  and wishes
                                                                     j

                                                      it   more.  — And,
oh  !   possible, let no hallowed prejudices prevent its immediate
        if
and universal adoption        !  Should not legislative enactment here
step in, and raise the voice of authority         ?
    I feel myself highly honoured          bythe handsome manner in
which Mr. Children has been good enough to mention my name
in his admirable paper, written as         acommentary on Mr. Long-
rouir's remarks.

losophy, is niade void by my experiments with parallel rods not
intersecting to form meshes.         I am happy to afford you a cor
rect solution, the inference of actual experiment.       In the results
of the experiments detailed in a former number of the Philoso
phical Magazine, I have stated my belief that the phaenomena
were neither electrical nor magnetic.        I find that if the rod in
troduced into the flame of a candle approximate the wick, it is
invested with a cloud of aqueous vapour, which fills up the
chasm to which I have alluded.            This emanation of aqueous
vapour    will suffer  condensation  by contact with the meshes of
wire-gauze cooled by the ambient atmosphere ; flame cannot
therefore run this gauntlet— for, in fact, the meshes are filled up
by a transparent screen of aqueous vapour.           The cause of the
interval between the surface of metal to which I have in my for
mer paper referred, is now completely and satisfactorily solved.
    I have made some experiments with flame — the aqueous par
ticles seem chiefly disengaged from the sides of the cone of
flame.     The upper part of the spire evolves the charcoal and
heated gases.      Sir H. Davy observes, that if burning phosphorus
is introduced into a large extent of flaming alcohol, its flame
Will be seen within that of the other : but I observe, if the base
of the flaming cone is from one to two inches diameter, that
both sulphur and phosphorus, when plunged into                  it,

ignited, are severally instantly extinguished;     nor does potassium
even burn in the interior.        have supposed that probably, when

           Limits of the perpetual Snows in            the   North*.
The determination      of the absolute height of the perpetual snows
in different latitudes is one of the most important branches of
physical geography : this heightdepends essentially on the climate
or mean temperature of each place; so that in order to attain the
laws of the distribution of heat at the surface of the globe, it will
be sufficient to know the height to which we must ascend under
different parallels in order to attain the limit of the snows.
    The observations made under the tropics by Bouguer and De
 Humboldt, those of Saussure, the determinations not less precise
of M. Ramond in the Pyrenees,— have proved that near the equa
tor, as in the temperate zone, the lowermost limit of the snows
agrees sufficiently with the mean temperature.       This is not the
case in the north of Europe, where, according to the most recent
measurements, the limit of the perpetual snows is more elevated
than one could have supposed from the mean state of the ther
mometer : besides, it is in Norway only that we can immediately
observe it. Although the mountains of Sweden are numerous and
very high, they attain almost no where the height of the perma
nent snows; so that this phenomenon is in that country as much
unknown as in the greater part of France or Germany.
   The observations of M. de Buch were made upon several peaks
of that vast chain of mountains which divides Norway throughout
its whole length, and extends without interruption from the 58th
to the 71st degree of north latitude f. The peak of Saletinds,
the elevation of which above the level of the sea is 1794 metres,
exceeds very little the limit of the snows : M. de Buch fixes it at

t    This chain yields to very few mountains in Europe in point of height,
and surpasses them all   by its extent and mass. When we traverse the Alps
or the Pyrenees, and scarcely arrived at the Passes we commence suddenly
to descend, we know of no pass exceeding          league

its origin, we see a platform or ridge stretching out, the height of which         is
almost every where 1400 metres above the level of the sea, and the breadth
eight, ten, and even twelve leagues. It   is impossible to traverse the chain
in  one day:  the inhabitants of the west side, who must pass over these de
serts to go into the eastern provinces, are obliged to pass the night there,
at the risk of losing themselves in everlasting mists, and perishing of cold in
the midst of tempests and whirlwinds of snow. — M. de Buch.

290               Abstract    of a Memoir      on the  Limits
1690 metres, the latitude being about 61°.                This height is less
(only 1597 metres)        in  the  chain  nearest   the sea,  which is called
Folge-Fonden-Field.           Finally,   the  Melderskin,     still   nearer the
ocean, constantly retains the snow, and yet             its  peak    is 209 me
tres below the limit at which we observe the same phaenomenon
on the Great Chain.
     In order to account for this gradual lowering of the limit of
snow in proportion as we approach the ocean, M. de Buch re
marks that the prevailing winds on the coasts of Norway are al
ways south-west and south ; northerly and easterly winds are there
infmitely less frequent, and feebler.            Now the former come from
 the warm regions : in passing over the sea they are saturated with
 humidity ; but being soon cooled by the continents, a part of
 the dissolved water is precipitated in the form of mists, clouds,
 and, fmally, of those torrents of rain which inundate the islands si
 tuated along the shore * : the sun penetrates but rarely this almost
 perpetual bed of clouds, and its rays warm the ground but slightly ;
 the temperature of the warmest months ought consequently to be
 less near the shores than in the interior, where the sun during
 the long days of summer exercises a great influence.                    There is
 therefore every year less snow melted on the mountains which are
 near the sea; and the limit at which it keeps unmelted ought to
 be lowered much.
      Another cause, of which Saussure had already perceived the in
  fluence, is the mass of mountains.            If the snow occupies a great
  extent, it lowers considerably the temperature around, and thereby
  prevents the lower snows from melting at elevations at which it
  would melt on isolated peaks. M. de Buch finds in the form and
  situation of the chain of Fonden Field, something on which to
  found a fortunate application of those considerations to the re
  markable phenomenon which he wished to explain.
      If we quit the countries just mentioned, and proceed 10 de
  grees further northward, i. e. to the extremities of the European
  continent, we expect to meet with the snow limit almost at the
  surface of the ground ; but the general aspect of the country soon
      * There never falls at Bergen in the
                                            space of a year, les9 than 68 inches
  of rain, and frequently 92 haye been known to fall : whereas atUpsal, in the
  same latitude, but in the interior, the annual quantity of rain does not exceed
   14 inches. The currents of heated and humid air which produce these
  great differences also exercise a remarkable influence in the gravity of the
  atmosphere. M. Hertzberi; of Kynservig, by using excellent syphon baro
  meters, never saw, for ten years, the mean annual height of the barometer
   exceed 23 inches and half a line {Q-75V1m). This result is confirmed by the
•
   observations of M. Stroem, under the 63(1 degree, and by those of           if.
  Schytte in the 68th : and ii will appear still move curious to learn that at Pe
  tersburg, Abo, and Stockholm, in the Baltic, the mean annual height of the
  barometer frequently rises to 28 inch. 3 lin. = 0 7646m.—      if. de Buch.

                of   the perpetual   Snoits in    the   North.         291
 shows that this is not the case. We find, in fact, under the 70th
 degree of latitude, fields and gardens well cultivated ; a numerous
 population also covers the shores of the gieat arms of the sea,
 and beautiful forests grow in the valleys.           It is towards the ex
 tremities of Lapland that the immense chain of mountains of Nor
 way divides and finally disappears.          One of the latter peaks, the
Akka-Sokki, situated in the interior of the Gulf of Alten, was
 not covered with snow when M. de Buch ascended it on the 16th
 of August 1807, and nevertheless, according to the barometrical
 observations, its height above the sea is 1023 metres : but an ad
joining mountain, the Storvauds Field, retains the snow the whole
year; its height is 1071 metres : — hence it results that in the 70th
 degree the limit sought ought to be nearly 1060 metres. This
 height  is,   as we see, considerable   ;   it equals that of the Puy du
 Dome, above the ridge of Clermont, and surpasses the height of
 the principal mountains of Germany.              Henceforth we ought no
 longer   to  be   astonished  that  at  the level   of the sea, i.  e. 1000
 metres below the snow limit, vegetation has still some vigour and
 the forests extend to great heights besides, the heights at which
                                         :
 the various species of trees and shrubs cease to grow are very
 clearly defined. The limits of the pines and birch-trees never vary
 beyond 30 metres, and exhibit themselves like lines of demarcation
 cut along the sides of the mountains.          We dwell upon this obser
 vation (in all respects so curious) the more forcibly, as M. de Buch
 made use of    it   to determine the snow limit at the North Cape.
     The following   is   the table of his results :           Metres.

           The snow ceases to melt at             -        - 1060
     There is    thereforea   difference of 245 metres between the limit
  of the pine and that of the birch-tree, and 578 metres between
 thelimit of the birch-tree and the snow limit.               These relative
  differences are the same in Norway and Lapland, although the
  absolute heights of the limits are different.       Thus we see the pines
  disappear     at  980  metres;   we  must  rise  to  1225 metres = 980

 height of the snows on the remotest islands towards the frozen

 snow does not remain the whole year. Thus near Hammer Fest,

that  itwould require 318 metres more in order that the snow
should not melt in summer.
   One remark of great truth We owe to M. de Buch, namely,
that the snow limit ought to depend chiefly on the temperature
of the months during which the snows usually melt so that                              ;          it
                                                                                                   is
not the mean temperature which determines its height. Thus in
the interior of the Gulf of Alten, the mean degree of the thermo

         is                            and yet the snow limit there

    We see that the definitive mean temperatures of the year differ
little from each other in these two places, and yet the mean of the
positive temperature rises at Uleoborg to 10°, whereas        does                           it
not go beyond 4U at North Cape.        Those considerations add to
the interest which ought to be excited for the determination of

     The height at which the perpetual snows are found under dif
 ferent latitudes, and the distance from their limit to that of the
 trees, have been recently the subject of a profound discussion in
 the Prolegomena de Distrilnitione Geographica Plantarum of M.
 de Humboldt.          We shall give in a future number of the Annales
 de Chimie et de Physique an extract of that part of the work
 which contains some new and ingenious considerations on the di
  rection of isothermal lir.es. At present we shall confine ourselves
 to such of M. de Humboldt's results as refer to the interesting
 question which is the subject of the article.
     1.     Between the tropics from 0° to 10° latitude in the Cor
dilleras of the new world, the limit of the snow = 4795 metres
  (2460 fathoms) . The mean temperature of the air at this height
 is not zero, as Bouguer and after him all have admitted, but ra
ther + 1*5° centigrade.
     2.    Between the parallels of 19°and21°of north latitude,
 Mexico, at the entrance of the torrid zone, we find perpetual
 snow at 4580 metres (2350 fathoms).
     3. Under thetemperate zone, on Caucasus lat. 42° — 43°, the
height according to Messrs. Englehardt and Parrot is 3216 me
tres (1650 fathoms).
     4.    In the Pyrenees (lat. 42°-i — 43°), M. Ramond finds the
permanent snows 2729 metres (1400 fathoms*). At this height
the mean temperature of the year = — 3-5°.
                                                                       5. The
    * We
            might have been astonished to find a difference of 487 metres (950
fathoms) between the height of the snow on Caucasus and the Pyrenees,
almost under the same parallel, if the discussion to which M. de Buch de
votes his memoir had not shown how great is the influence of local circum
stances.     The following passage, taken from a letter, now very old, of AI.
Ramond, will have the double advantage of affording a considerable degree
of certainty as to the determination of altitude which the text contains for
the Pyrenees, and of making known the peculiar causes which in this chain
render the observation difficult.
    " have remarked that the inferior snow limit descends lower the higher
      I
the mountains rise, and that themountains which form the skirts of a chain
are deprived of snow at a height ntwhich the centre mountains are covered.
    " Thus the Peak du Midi, although 2935 metres
                                                       (1506 fathoms) high, has
a permanent snow, if it is not in a ravine exposed to the north-west, and
still it disappears in warm summers. Neouville and Peak Long have perma
nent snows at 28S6 metres (1450 fathoms) only, and these snows contain
glacieres which never appear above them. But in order to have the charac
teristic limit of the Pyrenees we must go to the centre of the chain, i. e. to
the environs of Mont Perdu, Marborf, and Vigue Male.        I remark as follows
in places favourable to those kinds of observations : — there are carpets of
permanent snow above the Port de Pinede, Col de Nivclle, the lake of Mont
Perdu, and above the peaks of Port de Garyarnia, &c. The mean estimate

     5. The mean of the observations recently published by M.
Wahlenberg gives for the snow region in the Alps (lat. 45°-J-
  — 46°i) 2670 metres (1370 fathoms) . At this height the mean
 annual temperature = — 45, the mean of winter is— 10°, that of
summer + 6°.
     6.    The mean temperature of the year, at the height at which
 M. de Buch has found the limit of the snows under the 68th de
 gree of latitude, is — 6° ; that of winter = — 20'5°, that of summer
  + 9-5°.
     From the parallel of Popocatepec in Mexico, to that of Etna,
 the inferior limit of the snow has not yet been determined by
 direct measurements.           According to the researches of M. de
 Humboldt, this limit, by the latitude of 28* 17°, which is that of
 the Peak of Teneriffe, must be 3800 metres (1950 fathoms), but
the height of this ridge is only 37 1 1 (1904 fathoms) ; so that if it
 is clear of snow during summer, it is less on account of being
 heated (as was thought) by the volcanic fire, than on account of
 its elevation, which is not considerable enough.
     In order to show how much this department of general physics
 has gained latterly by the researches of travellers, we shall sub
join the heights which Kirwan and all subsequent authors assign
to the limits of snow, and by their side the results which have
been furnished by direct observations :

 local circumstances, of ravines, or exposure, &c.      Besides, nothing is more
 difficult than to establish this fact in the Pyrenees, because the whole cen

 LIX.     On Cast Iron and Steel; with Experiments to ascer

    David Mushet, Esq. of Coleford, Forest of Dean.
                             To   Mr. Tilhch.
 Sir, —    As    soon as the following analysis of Swedish iron and
steel, by Bergman, was generally known to the iron- trade of this
country, an expectation prevailed that by combining manganese
with the ironstones or iron ores used at our own furnaces, or by
the discovery of an iron ore already combined with manganese,
a quality of cast iron would be produced, that might be manu
factured subsequently into bar iron fit for making good steel.

   I am not aware of any regular series of experiments having
been performed on the large scale, to justify the general expecta
tion.    The late Mr. Reynolds used manganese, not in the
smelting furnace, but in the subsequent operation of refining the
cast iron, doubtless with a view to effect a combination of the
metal of manganese with the iron, corresponding to the above
analysis.    The steel manufactured from this iron was in point
of quality, I believe, superior to any formerly made from coke
iron in this country, but I helieve that no direct experiment
was made to ascertain whether any metallic manganese, and
                                                                      -
what quantity, became united to the iron.                                >
   Steel-iron and steel have since been manufactured to some
extent near Ulverston, not with coke but wood charcoal, and
the quantity or fitness of the iron for steel- making attributed di
rectly to a portion of manganese in the ore.
   In the above analysis there is a decided anomaly, which of
itself would be sufficient to lead to a suspicion of the accuracy of
the result.    If in the first place it is admitted that the original
crude iron contained 15 1 per cent, of manganese, it is extremely
improbable, from the superior affinity of manganese for oxygen,
that no extra proportion of this beyond that of the iron should

be wasted or burnt out during its exposure to the blast of the
refinery; and that the resulting bar iron should still contain the
same quantity of 15i per cent, originally in the cast iron.
   The French chemists very early doubted the presence of man
ganese in iron and steel, and subjected some of their best steel to a
rigid analysis.   I find the following record of their experiments by
Vauquelin, in Nicholson's Journal, quarto series, vol. ii. p. 212.

   The approximation of the results of these experiments to each
Other, in which the presence of manganese was not at all disco
vered, is a strong proof of their accuracy: but as Vauquelin and
Bergman in no case seem to have analysed the same iron, it
does not prove the non-existence of manganese in the Swedish
iron analysed by the latter.        Those who consider the excellence
of steel to be derived from the presence of metallic manganese,
may deduce an inference from the experiments of Vauquelin in
favour of their own theory ; as it is confessed in the comparative
experiments detailed in that memoir, that the steel of Franee
will not stand comparison with the best steel of England : the
latter in this country being always manufactured from the best
                                                                Swedish

Swedish irons.       As far as my own experiments go on the sub
ject of analysing by deoxidation and fusion the ores from which
the Swedish steel irons are manufactured, I have not found any
indications of a larger proportion of manganese than I found in
the ores of this country.          Nor have I at any time been able to
satisfy myself   that  the   presence of manganese imparted any pe
culiar excellence to the steel produced in these experiments.
    At the time when the alloys of manganese with iron excited
considerable interest in this country, I made some experiments
on the subject, which if you consider at this late period fit for
insertion in your Magazine, they are much at your service.
    I first attempted to prove whether it was probable that me
tallic manganese united to iron in the process followed by Mr.
 Reynolds. — For this purpose I selected a quantity of cast iron
boring dust, with which the following experiments were made :
                                                                        Grains.

           This was  fused     alone in a clay crucible, and the
       result was a mottled button of cast iron, weighing                382

    dense,    and   impressed     with  the same crystallization that
    was noticed upon its surface.             By comparing this result
    with No. 4, where the same quantity of oxide of manga
    nese was used, it appears extremely probable that a portion
    of metallic manganese was here united to the iron nearly
    equal to 4| per cent, the difference of the metallic waste
    sustained in the two fusions.

    fracture, grayish blue, steel-grained.              If compared with
    No. 4, where only half the quantity of manganese was used,
    the metallic oxidation, is less     \  a per cent, rendering it still
    more probable      that  a portion  of   metallic manganese in this,
    as in No. 9, became united to the iron in fusion.            But this
    quantity seems so small for experiments performed in close
    crucibles, that I am inclined to think, in the refining of cast
    iron, as practised by Mr. Reynolds, in an open furnace
    with oxide of manganese, that no metallic alloy took place
    with the iron.
        With a view to investigate the subject further, and to
    prove what effect in the furnace would be produced by mix
                                                                       ing

     ing charcoal with the manganese, I attempted to fuse
     400 grains of the same boring dust with 40 grains of char
     coal. The result was imperfect, owing to the iron and char
     coal forming a carburet, which was infusible in the highest
     heat of the furnace.      With 15 grains charcoal and the same
     quantity of boring dust, a fine button of carbonated smooth
     faced iron was obtained, weighing 391 grains ; loss 9 grains,
     or 2\ per cent. ; fracture blackish gray.

     These experiments make it evident, that metallic manganese
  may be united to cast iron by mixing it with a portion of char
  coal ; and it is probable that a similar effect would take place in
 the puddling furnace.          But as in these experiments with the
 charcoal in mixture, the iron was not decarbonated or refined
 enough, it cannot be positively inferred that the metallic man
 ganese would remain alloyed with the iron during the whole pro
 cess of refmement.

 have led to theories founded on truth ; but it will not in the

out sufficient facts to support them has been the bane of science,

  most of the qualities requisite for the purposes of statuary.
       "  Few substances in the catalogue of those with which ceco-
  nomical nmieralogy is concerned have excited more interest than
  statuary marble, from its rarity, its beauty, and its indispensable
  necessity in the art of sculpture.        It has at different times
  formed an object of anxious research in this country, and pre
  miums have been held out for it by the Society of Arts.          It has
  consequently      been found in  various parts  of Scotland, as well as
  in Ireland, but no native specimens have yet been introduced into
  the arts.      As the causes which have impeded their introduction
  have hitherto been such as may be considered adventitious, being
  of a commercial nature, and not founded on any ex perience of
  their physical defects, it has been hoped that they might by
   perseverance and time be removed, and that those statuary mar
  bles of this country might at some future day supersede the
   necessity of importing this article.       It will not therefore be a
   misplaced inquiry to examine the several properties of those mar
   bles which have at different times held a place in the estima
   tion of artists, and to compare them with our own specimens,
   more particularly with that of Sky, now under review, the most
   abundant and certainly the most specious of all those which
   have yet been found in Britain.         The inquiry is the more ne
   cessary,    as the  several circumstances    in which white marbles
   differ, do not appear to have been generally attended to, and as an
   undue value seems in some instances to have been fixed on our
   own in popular estimation, although not in that of sculptors
    themselves.
        "  The value of this substance in those distant periods when
   the arts of Greece flourished, occasioned an industrious research
    after a material in which the sublime ideas of its artists could be
,  embodied.       Accordingly many quarries have been wrought in
    ancient times, of which little has descended to us but the names,
    and a few of the works which were executed from their produce.
    These marbles were of various qualities, and examples of them
     are still to be seen in ancient statues; although with regard to
    many of them, a species of evidence, often little better than con
    jectural, has guided sculptors and mineralogists in their attempts
    to determine the quarries from whence they were derived.
    Among these, the quarries of Parose afforded a marble (the often-
     quoted lychnites of Pliny) in which it is asserted that the cele
     brated Venus was wrought, as well as some others to which we
     have not access.     But there are many specimens of sculpture in
    the   British Museum which seem to have been executed in tfris
    stone, or in one at least of analogous character.
                                                                     "  Of

    " Of the nature    of the Parian marble we are enabled to speak
positively,   since some   blocks of it have been quarried during the
last   few  years,   and  are  now to be found in the shops of the
sculptors of this city.      The grain of this marble is large and
glistening, while at the same time its texture is loose and soft,
and its colour of a yellowish and watery white.            It possesses
considerable translucency on the edges, a quality which, how
ever desirable in statuary marble when of a fine grain, from the
softness which it gives to the outline, only increases the disagree
able aspect of the Parian, by the anguiar reflections of light
which take place on the pellucid edge and surface, from the
innumerable faces of the small plates.       The specimens of sculp
ture which I am about to quote, will exemplify this fault.           It is
certain indeed that the Greek sculptors abandoned the marble
of Paros after the quarries of Luna and Carrara were discovered,
the superior fmeness and whiteness of these marbles, which at
present cause them to excel any with the places of which we are
now acquainted, rendering them also at least equal to the best
of those ancient ones of which the native places are now un
known.
    "  Independently of the injurious effects which the large grain
of the Parian marble produces on the transparent surface of
sculptured works, and the false lights which it thus introduces
into the contour, it interferes materially with the requisite cor
rectness of drawing in the lesser works, and is thus inapplicable
to the details of small sculptures in relief. It is nevertheless sus
ceptible of a good polish, a quality, however, of little value in
the eyes of the statuary, and one which in this variety only serves
to render the defects of its texture more apparent.            It is also
said to have been deficient in size, since it was so intersected by
fissures as to be incapable of yielding blocks of more than five
feet in length. I may add, that in the present state of the public
habits with regard to white marbles, there is no demand for
modern works executed in Parian marble.           Its celebrity is con
signed to the metaphors of poets.
    "  It will afford satisfaction to those who arc interested in the
arts to point out such works in the British Museum as appear
to have been executed in Parian marble, or in one of similar
character.                        . .

    " A marble of a much finer grain, and capable of a high polish,
 is described by the antients, as found near the river Coralus in
 Phrygia, as well as in some of the Greek islands : it is supposed
to be the variety known to statuaries by the name of marmo Gre
 co, and some ancient statues are described as being formed of
this marble.     It is possible that specimens of it may exist in the
 British Museum, but our sculptors are, as far as I know, incapa
ble of distinguishing it at present, and it is much too hazardous
to assign the place of a particular specimen from the contempla
 tion of a polished and often of a stained surface.      Mr. Tennant
has found that the marmo Greco is a magnesian limestone.
    " I am equally unable to point out specimens of that variety
known to the Italians by the name of marmo statuario, of which
the quarries are also lost, but which, with greater translucency of
surface, resembles the Parian marble in the largeness of its grain,
unless those which I have conjectured to belong to this variety,
when describing the specimens of sculpture in Parian, do in fact
appertain to the latter.
    " The quarries of Luna produce a compact white marble sus
ceptible of a high polish, and capable of being wrought with the
most minute accuracy.        Hence it is preferable for the finer ope
rations of bas-relief, either to the Parian, of which the aspect in
terferes with the delicacy of finish and of surface required in these
works, or to the Pentelic, which was subject to accidents from
veins of mica and of serpentine, or to that of Carrara, in which
dark veins are of frequent occurrence.       It was accordingly pre
ferred by the antients, and among many other works, the Apollo
(Belvedere) is said to have been executed in Luna marble.          We
have no other knowledge of the marbles of Hymettus and of Ara
bia than their names.
    " Of all the marbles employed in the works of the antients, and
of which many specimens have descended to our days, that of
Carrara is almost the only one which is at present held in esti
mation, or is now accessible to modern sculptors.         This marble
is of a very fine grain and compact texture ; it is also susceptible
of a high polish when required, and is consequently applicable to
everv species of sculpture, except when, as is too often the case,

dark veins intrude and spoil the beauty of the work.             Notwith
standing the general apparent uniformity       of   its texture,  it offers
different varieties of aspect. It is always of a fine granular fracture,
vet this fracture is sometimes combined with a slight tendency to
the flat splinterv, in which case the stone js harder and more trans
lucent than when it is purely granular.      When merely granular it
is somatimes dry and crumbly, precisely as if it had been exposed
to a high heat ; it then loses much of its transparency, and is
called woolly by sculptors.      Its transparency is various, and in
some cases nearly equal to that of .alabaster, (granular gypsum).
    " The bust of Marcellus in the Museum offers an example of a
very fine grained and extremely translucent marble, apparently of
this kind.     The specimen employed in the bust of Messalina is
equally remarkable for the fmeness and beauty of its texture.            In
a bust of a youthful Hercules in the same collection the identity
 of the marble is marked by the dark veins which are to be seen
in it ; but it is unnecessary to quote individual specimens, as the
 greatest number of the sculptures in this collection appear to have
been executed in Carrara marble.
    " The last of the antient marbles which I shall describe is that
of Pentelicus, of which the quarries are probably still to be found
in the vicinity of Athens, although they have not been investigated
by modern travellers.       But we are in possession of numerous
specimens of sculpture in this stone, from which we are able to
determine its qualities; two are to be seen in the British Museum.
Of these there is the bust of a Philosopher, of, apparently, antient
and very dry workmanship : the other is the celebrated Disco-
bulus.    It is known that Myron the Athenian, who flourished
about 440 A.C. executed a work of this character in bronze :
but we have no evidence respecting the marble statue, and artists
have therefore remained in doubt whether it was executed by him
self or was a copy by another hand.          This question cannot be
positively decided by the sculpture itself, however high its merits.
In the mean time a step is gained by the mineralogical investi
gation of the material, and thus mineralogy is capable of throwing
light on the history of the arts. The substance in which it is
wrought must therefore be considered a sufficient proof of the an
tiquity of the copy, if it be such, as well as of its having been ex
ecuted at Athens, since the quarries of Pentelicus were abandoned
in consequence of their defects, as soon as those of Carrara and
Luna were known. Although it is difficult or impossible to de
termine this period, yet as so few works in Pentelic marble poste
rior to the time of Phidias and of Myron have descended to us, it
is probable that little use was made of those quarries after the pe
riod of these artists.   We are therefore, perhaps, entitled to con
clude that the Discobulus of the Townley collection is an Athe
                                                                      nian

 hian work of the best age of sculpture, and not a copy by any more
 modern artist ; and that if it was executed neither by Myron him
 self nor under his direction, it is yet not likely to have been much
 inferior to the original, while it may serve, at the same time, as
 some proof of the esteem in which that work was held at Athens.
    But the most numerous examples of Pentelic marble are to be
 found in those works of Phidias which form the collection of Lord
 Elgin, and which afford easy access to examination.        In the pre
 sent corroded and tarnished state of the surfaces of these statues
 we cannot trace the nature or the defects of this variety, but an
 examination of its texture and composition in the broken frag
 ments, serves to excite the deepest regret, that the genius of the
greatest sculptor whom the world has seen, should for want of
better materials have been condemned to bestow its energies on
so perishable and so defective a stone.       This marble is of a loose
texture and moderate-sized grain, coarser than that of Carrara,
but finer than that of Paros; in colour it is exceedingly imperfect,
being tinged with gray, brown, and yellow, and mottled with
transparent parts, which give it the appearance of having been
stained with oil.    But its most formidable defect is its laminated
structure, and the quantity of mica with which it is contaminated :
to this we are to attribute the corrosion and almost entire ruin of
so many of the specimens, the action of the weather dissolving
those parts of the stone where the mica is most abundant, and
eating deep fissures through many parts of the work.           It is pe
culiarly unfortunate that the two most admirable specimens, spe
cimens which are calculated to excite in the minds of artists a
mixed feeling of wonder and despair, the horse's head and the
Theseus, should be those which have suffered most.           Had they
been fortunately executed in the more uniform and durable stone
of Carrara, these works might still have been preserved to us in
all their original perfection of drawing and surface.         Even the
hammer of the Turk would have rebounded with little injury frorri
the marbles of this texture, while the micaceous stone of Pente-
licus splitting in the direction of its laminae, has permitted the
complete mutilation of many valuable sculptures.
    " We have no geological information with regard to the rela
tions of these stones. The great resemblance of the Pentelic
marble to that of Glen Tilt in aspect and composition, renders it
probable that like this it lies in mica slate, forming beds parallel
to and interstratified with that rock : that the others have similar
relations to the primary rocks, we should have concluded on ge
neral geological principles, had we not ah eady seen that the white
marble. of Sky which has given rise to this discussion belongs to
the secondary strata.

discovered in our own islands, for the purpose of comparing their
relative properties and the value which they are likely to possess
in sculpture.       I am unfortunately unable to give any account of
those found in Ireland, neither having seen their places, nor being
possessed of any specimens.
     " That which has been found at Cape Wrath in Scotland, is of
a grain much larger than even the Parian, and is consequently
useless for the purpose of sculpture ; and this indeed is by much
the most common character of the Scottish specimens.               Those of
Blairgowrie,      of Glenavon, and   of Balahulish,   are  all equally cha
racterized by this large sparry texture, and         are   all equally unfit
for sculpture, however applicable to the purposes of architecture.
 The marble of lona has been long since exhausted, and conse
 quently requires no particular notice : however valuable from the
 purity of its colour and compactness of its texture, yet the uncer
 tainty of its splintery fracture before the chisel, (that tool without
 which no spirited work was ever finished,) combined with its great
 hardness, would probahly have rendered it useless in the arts, even
 if it were still to be procured.
      " In a paper on Assynt I have already described the white
 marble of that district: it is of a very close texture, and although it
 contains no earth but lime, is of unusual specific gravity and hard
 ness.     It is incapable of being polished, a circumstance, it is true,
 of no consequence in statuary, since the polish only gives a false
 light to the surface and is not admitted of in modern sculpture ;
 but it labours under the concomitant disadvantage of want of
 transparency, producing nearly the same dead effect and dry out
 line as is seen in a plaster cast, a fault in itself sufficient to pre
 vent it from ever being adopted as a good material in the arts :
                                                                          '
  its extreme hardness also renders it very expensive to work.
      " The marble of Sky, the more immediate object of this dis
  cussion, is of a pure white colour, and appears sufficiently exten
  sive and continuous to be capable of yielding large blocks.            The
  purity  of  its colour  is seldom contaminated   ;   its  fracture  is gra
  nular and splintery, and its texture fine, less fine than that of
  lona, but more so than that of Assynt : its compactness, hardness,-
  and gravity, are greater than those of the marble of Carrara,
  which it in fact resembles in little else than colour.         It is appa
  rently well fitted for all purposes of sculpture, as it can be wrought
   in any direction, and has sufficient transparency, while at the same
  time it assumes even a better polish than is required for statuary.
  With these good qualities, however, is combined an uncertainty
   arising from its unequal hardness.     While some parts of the stone
   are nearly as easy to work as that of Carrara, many other speci
   mens turn out so hard as to add a charge of near 50 per cent, to
   the cost of working : this appears to arise from the influence of

lower freight duty and insurance.          Such are the difficulties which
 oppose the introduction of the most perfect marble which has
yet been found in Britain, difficulties which, slight as they are,
ought, together with the prevalence of established habits and of
a   commercial routine, to check the extravagant hopes which

is saccharine, then fine grained and arenaceous ; a compact va
 riety having a porcellaneous aspect and blueish-gray colour suc
 ceeds; this towards the outer edge becomes yellowish white, and
insensibly graduates into the unaltered chalk.         The flints in
 the altered chalk usually assume a gray yellowish colour: the
 altered chalk is highly phosphorescent when subjected to heat.
 In the neighbourhood of Glenarm, where a singular compound
dyke, consisting of three branches, traverses the chalk, the in
 cluded masses have been changed into granular marble.         Other
instances of this change of the chalk are quoted, as also of
 changes effected by the whin dykes on rocks which they traverse,
as of red sandstone to homstone, of the slate clay o/ the coal-
measures to flinty slate, and of the coal itself to cinders.     The
inference which Mr. Conybeare would draw from these facts,
f   were it allowable to speculate on subjects so remote from ac
tual observation," is, " that the hypothesis which ascribes the
formation of the floetz-trap rocks to submarine volcanoes, which
were active at a very remote period before the seas and continents
had assumed their present relative level, is both in itself more
consistent, and in its application to the actual phaenomena more
satisfactory than any other.

A   Practical Essay on Chemical Reagents or Tests; illustrated
    by a Series of Experiments.      By Fredrick Accum, Operative
    Chemist, &c &c. pp. 26.'>. By Callow, Crown-court, Soho.
    When it was ascertained that many of the substances of na
ture are compounds of different principles, methods were suc
cessfully employed to separate those principles by chemical
means ; and the name of Reagents or Tests was given to those
substances by means of which their analysis was accomplished.
    To those who study chemistry, whether from motives of pro-
fit, amusement, or general information, a knowledge of the action
of chemical tests is absolutely necessary; indeed it 'constitutes
one of the first objects to. which the attention of the chemist
ought to be directed.       The practical application of chemical
tests requires comparatively but little skill, and no costly ap

   paratus and instruments; but the phenomena which these bodies
   produce form an assemblage of facts, the knowledge of which
   13 of infinite   service, and absolutely necessary to the successful
  practice of the science.
       Mr. Accum's treatise is drawn up with a view to facilitate the
   study of this department, of operative chemistry.           His aim has
   been to exhibit experimentally to the young chemist, a summary
   view of the general nature of chemical tests, with the effects
   and phenomena which are produced by the action of these bodies
  >— the particular uses to which they may be applied in the various
   pursuits of chemical science, and the practical means, or art of
   applying them successfully. To accomplish this object, the au
   thor has in the first place stated separately, and in the synthetic
   form of propositions, the charactistic powers of each individual
   test, and has then exhibited a series of apposite, experiments, to
   illustrate its attributes and peculiar mode of action, so as to
   interest the mind of the operator and to imprint the specific
  powers of the test under considertion on his memory. The young
   chemist may therefore easily convince himself of the action of
   each test enumerated in the treatise, by repeating in his own
   closet the experiments pointed out by the author.            To accom
  plish   this object  with  facility, Mr. Accum    has chosen  such parti
   cular experiments only as are easy to be performed, and the ex-
'
  hibition of which requires no other agents than those enumerated
   in the work, together with a small table lamp-furnace, a few
   test tubes, two or three evaporating basons, flasks, &c*             And
   as the science of chemistry affords numerous instances which
   render it necessary that the substances used as tests should be
  applied with particular care, the precautions to be observed,
  to guard against deceitful appearances that may occur under
   certain circumstances (and without which chemical tests are of
  little utility), are carefully pointed out by the author of this trea
  tise, to put the experimenter on his guard, to deduce the effects
  produced from their true causes, and to apply tests successfully
   in the pursuits of analysis.
       A list of all those substances for which there exist any ap
   propriate tests has also been added; together with direct re
  ferences to those reagents, by means of which the substances
   exhibited in that list may individually be detected.
        From what we have so far stated, it will be obvious that the
   aim of the author, in composing this treatise, has been, to furnish
  instructions to enable the student of chemistry to apply chemical
  tests to original investigations, or to enable him to perform a

   forming the experiments described in the treatise, may be had as a com
   panion to the work.

series of easy, amusing, and instructive experiments, in illustra
tion of the affinities of bodies, and most important chemical
changes of which certain substances of nature are susceptible in
their reciprocal action.
    Mr. Accum's name as an author and practical philosophical
chemist is sufficiently known, and we think this treatise (which
was hitherto a desideratum in chemical libraries) will add to his
reputation.     The work is clear and explicit. The peculiar pro
perties of the individual tests, together with their attributes,
modes of action, and the rules for applying them, are detailed
with precision, and the series of experiments are well calculated
to answer the intended purpose.

  5 1,34S,291 pounds, lifted one foot high with each bushel of coals
  — the load 15 lib. 2 oz. per inch in cylinder.       His other engine
  at the latter mine lifted 22,477,408 pounds with each bushel,
  her load being as yet only 3"1 per inch in cylinder.

  clude, though this is not avowed, that Woolf's principle of
  using steam above the temperature of 212', and allowing it to
  expand, has been in some way applied to these engines ; and we
  do so because Mr. Watt has often declared that the maximum
  of the best engines on his, which is now the old, principle, is
  29 millions of pounds lifted one foot high with each bushel of
  coals; and we know that his statement cannot be controverted.

                                To  Mr. Titloch.
      Sir, — As   the eclipse of the sun, Which takes place on the
   19th of the ensuing month, will be the greatest that will happen
  in this part of the world for many years, it will naturally excite
  considerable attention.        It may be necessary however to inform
  your astronomical readers, that the first impression of the moon
  on the sun's disc will be 20° from the vertex of the sun, on the
  right hand ; and not 595 as stated in the Nautical Almanac.
   This remark is of importance to those who are desirous of ob
   serving accurately the time and progress of the eclipse.        The
  visible conjunction is also inaccurately stated in the same Al
   manac, since it takes place full one hour sooner than there set
   down.     It is no great recommendation to that work, to know
   that all the elements of this eclipse are more correctly stated in

      M. Gay-Lussae has published in the number of the Annahi
 de   Ckimie et Physique for May last, the following interesting
  observations "on the alteration which sulphuric ether undergoes."
   I kept for nearly two years sulphuric ether in a glass bottle which
  was half full and which was occasionally opened.          I had purified
  thi3 ether, by washing it several times with water, then by
  leaving it fifteen days on quick-lime, the whole surface of which
  it did not cover; and finally, by distilling it in the water-bath,
  and collecting only the first portions.      Thus prepared, it began
  to boil at 35-66°:'its density at 24-8" was 0-7119, and it had
  no action upon turnsole.          Wishing lately to make some ex
  periments on the dilatation of this liquid, I endeavoured to as
  certain if it had undergone any alteration ; and I found that its
 density had increased, that it feebly reddened turnsole, and that
 its boiling point, little above 35-6° at the commencement of the
                                       I it,
 distillation, was removed from           towards the end, more than
 20°.     Surprised  at   these results, examined the residue, which
 was unfortunately very weak, and             recognized the following
                                               I
  properties: its smell announced the presence of sulphuric ether
 and acetic ether:         was strongly acid, and united with water in
                           it
 all proportions — its taste was excessively hot and acrid.
                       :                                                           A
 portion of this residue, to which    I  added a tittle potash, was eva
 porated to dryness, and the sulphuric acid afterwards sent off
 from      very poignant vapours of acetic acid. On another portion
          it
 of the residue poured concentrated sulphuric acid, and imme
                       I
 diately there was separated a very limpid colourless oil,            little a
 heavier than water, and which remained fluid at the common
temperature, and the taste of which, although very hot, had not
 the same characters with that of the residue.           had I    globulea

it   had any resemblance with the sweet oil of wine.
     On   athird portion of the residue of the distillation of the
ether  I  poured     little hydrochloric acid, and added concentrated
                       a

I  recommend the subject therefore to some abler chemists, who
have opportunities of preparing great quantities of sulphuric ether.

liXIII.     On Planelary Influences on the Almosphere.             By the
                          Rev. T. Drummono.
           • jr             To  Mr. Tillnch.
Sir, — IVIankino          has  from a very remote period exhibited
two classes of characters, — the credulous and the incredulous.
 It has frequently occurred that credulity has predominated with
out evidence or argument to give it sanction, and that incre
dulity has been cherished without any attempt to investigate the
 truth or falsehood of the positions in question.
    The credulous and the incredulous have perhaps in no in
stance been more tenacious in opinion than on the subject of
 planetary influence.      As the object of this paper is confined to
 the consideration of planetary influences on the atmosphere,
 it is not necessary for us to investigate the ground on which
philosophers of preceding periods contended for the universal
 prevalence of starry influences.
    The hypothesis I am disposed to advocate is of great anti
quity ; we can trace its vestiges in remote periods — its origin
baffles all chronological precision.
    The doctrine of planetary influence was the foundation of the
 Sabian system of religious worship.          It engaged the attention
of Babylonian and' Egyptian sages; and in every civilized state
of human existence, as amongst the Perses, the Hindoos, and
the Chinese — people whose antiquity distances all competition —
we fmd that astrological science was accounted worthy the at
 tention of the most intelligent persons.          Modern philosophers
have limited the title of science to astronomy, i. e. the elemen
tary part; and consigned astrology, i. e. the application of ele
mentary knowledge combining observation and inferences, to
disrepute, if not to oblivion.
    Indiscriminate ridicule, censure, or contempt, are not worthy
of admission within the pale of philosophy. — Whilst the fabulous
stories of the Pleiades or the Hyades having been the daughters
of Atlas, are mere modern romances, comparatively speaking, or at
best enigmatical vehicles of some concealed truth, and most pro
bably of Grecian invention, — we must look to the extensively
prevalent Sabian system of theology as far more ancient, and
we mav rationally infer that in its primitive reception it was not
chargeable with idolatry.
    The etymology of the term is uncertain, — perhaps from Sabos
in Arabia*, — but Sabianism or Sabism is now generally under
stood to imply the worship of the heavenly bodies.
   * There can lie little doubt, I think, ahout the etymology of this word.
It  is derived from Hyf tsuba, commonly" pronounced saba, an army or
    Vol. 48. No. 223. Nov. 1816.                       X               host.

S22                       On Planetary Influences
   If we     resolve to reject every doctrine which has at any time
been    misapprehended, or whose truths have by the multitude
been confounded with error, the subjects for. our belief will be
very limited.
    The opinion adopted by the Perses, the Chinese, and tlie
ancient Greeks, appears to have been, that a supreme ruling in
visible Power exists, with whom the planets and stars are so
connected as to be the creative and productive powers, the im
mediate agents of the Deity.         Thence the Chinese of the an
cient school, at this day worship Tien or Theaven, by which
they understand the supreme power presiding in that vast ex
panse where the planets and stars have their respective motions.
From the positions of the planets, from the rising and setting of
the constellations, they have time immemorial attempted to pre
dict the vicissitudes of the seasons; and since every change in the
atmosphere must be the effect of some secondary operating cause,
it is at least decorous to investigate before we condemn a practice
which has received the testimony of ages in its defence.
    The Sabian system of worship, which enrols the planets and stars
 in its ritual as objects of adoration, is to be considered one of the
many instances in which error has tarnished the lustre of truth.
    If we refer to the history of the patriarchal families, we fmd
the primitive religion in its purity; — in the records of the Old
Testament we perceive that the patriarchs retained those cor
rect principles of true religion, which acknowledged the unity
and supremacy of the Deity, and limited religious homage to
that one God, whilst the planetary bodies and all secondary
causes were regarded merely as the ministers of the will of God.
— An extract from Josephus may serve to testify that the idea
is correct with regard to Abraham :
    " Abraham was the first* that adventured to preach up the
doctrine of one God, the Almighty Maker and Creator of all
things in heaven and earth : and that for all the comforts we
enjoy in this world, it is to his infinite goodness, not to any
power in ourselves, that we stand indebted for them.          This he
argued     from   the orderly course of things, both at sea and land,
in their times and seasons, and from his, observations upon the
motions and influences of the sun, moor,, and stars; insomuch
that, without an over-ruling and an administering providence to
keep the whole a-going, the whole frame of the universe must
drop into confusion ; and consequently that all we have to trust
host. In tlie sacred volume the sun, moon, anil stars are called the saba,
that    the host, of heaven (Deut. iv. 19); and the Israelites were expressly
       is,
commanded not to worship the saba, but him who made them, and who          i»
therefore called EHOVAI1 flltdf snbaotli—tUe Lord of Hosts. — Edit.

to, for matters either of pleasure, profit, or necessity, depends
singly upon the good-will and bounty of the first mover; so that
it is to him alone that we are to render all honour and thanks
giving, without assuming any thing to ourselves." — L'Estrange's
Josephus, chap. viii.
   The Book of Job is a fair specimen of Sabian theology before
the less refined sentiments of what is now denominated Sabian
worship were introduced. — The beautiful poem, with the argu
mentative narratives contained in the Book of Job, is of great an-
uquity; — no internal evidence assists us in determining the age
in which it was written, nor the author to whom we are indebted
for a composition which has merited, and will ever merit, the ad
miration of mankind.      The personification of the agent of evil
is a specimen of poetical licence, but the subsequent matter is
simple in its theology and correct in its ethics.     The sublimity
of thought and the pure morality contained in this work are
admitted to be superior to the productions of Homer.
   Although many allusions are made to the customs of patri
archal ages, or rather of the early stages of civilization, it may
not be without hesitation inferred that the Book of Job was fa
bricated beyond the precincts of improved civilization and highly
cultivated talent. —The arguments of the friends of Job are
founded on principles similar to those which have in several
periods of the world formed the bases of academic questions.
    I have no wish, sir, to fill your pages with theological or
ethical discussions, nor to involve your readers with investiga
tions concerning the probable writer of that excellent composi
tion, — whether Enoch, or anv of his predecessors or cotempo-
raries, is of no moment, — the state of astronomical, and, if the
distinction must be observed, of astrological science, at the a-ra
in which the poem was written, is deducible from the mention
of Maaaroth, Arcturus, Orion, and the Pleiades, more espe
cially from the mention made of the sweet influences of the
Pleiades; whence we must infer that the writer was no stranger
to the prevalent opinion of sidereal influence.
   What the writer of the Book of Job appears to have credited,
— what Abraham from the statements in Josephus appears to
have corroborated, — may, I beg leave to presume, be considered
as having constituted a part of that knowledge which Moses
acquired amongst the Egyptians", and in which Daniel and his
associates became proficients in the court of Babylon.
   Impelled by a desire of attaining the knowledge of truth, and
with that view desirous of divesting myself of all prejudice, I must
avow that I see nothing in a creed considering the starry host
as the agents of Deity by their mutual attractions and repulsions,
at the same time limiting to the Divine Being all the reverence

of worship which Jewish prophets may not be supposed to have
adopted, and to which Christian divines may not be allowed to
subscribe.      Regarding those astrological atmospherical observa
tions which have escaped the ravages of time, as the fragments
of a science which was successfully cultivated in many ancient
periods, I presume that the attention of the moderns directed
to the changes in the atmosphere, and to the coincident situation
of the planets, may improve our meteorological knowledge, and
enable us to recover all that was ever known by the sages of an
 tiquity,                                                            v
    The sun    is generally allowed to be the exciter  of what we call
heat in the atmosphere and on our earth ; and ft is not requisite
 on this occasion to inquire whether the sun emits light and heat,
 or whether it excites them in the body of the air and the surface
 of the earth.
    The moon is commonly supposed to have no atmosphere like
 our own ; but that it has an influence on whatever constitutes
 our atmosphere is generally acknowledged.
    The influences of the sun and moon are so well authenticated
 by the observances on the periodical flow and ebb of the tides
 in the waters encompassing our earth, that no differences in
 opinion exist relative to the ordinary causes and effects ; and it
 may not be unworthy our attention to inquire, whether extraor
 dinary ebbings and flowings are not imputable to other planetary
 and sidereal influences.
    No one questions that what is usually expressed by the term
 attraction operates between bodies of different magnitudes; and
 confining our attention to what is denominated the solar system,
 whatever properties or qualities are ordained by the divine
  Creator to regulate the movements and limit the approximation
 of the planetary bodies, must be conceived to operate in every
 part of the space in which they revolve.
     It is of no moment in the present consideration how far the
 late Rev. J.Wesley was correct in his remark, that astronomers
  assuming the magnitudes of the heavenly bodies infer their di
 stances, and assuming their distances infer their magnitudes : the
  question is, what plausible reason can be assigned whence we
  may infer that their relative situations produce those atmospherical
  changes,
             " the skiey influences" to which we are subjected.
     A small ball freely suspended near the side of a mountam is
  by an undiscernible influence moved from a perpendicular di
  rection, — a small magnet has a property of producing an effect
  not only at a distance through the intervening portion of air,
  but of manifesting its operation, although glass, wood, and a
  variety of other substances, intervene; — yet it is by many regarded
  as incredible that such large bodies as Jupiter and Saturn can
                                                                  have.

        Some Olservations       on the  Salt Mines  of Cardona.       325
have any corresponding action or effect. The planetary bodies,
according to modern philosophers, are too remote to act on each
other, or on the atmosphere around us. The varying belts of
Jupiter and the extended ring of Saturn may be atmospheres,
yet not perfectly similar to the aerial envelope surrounding our
earth; but every planet must be surrounded with a fluid, what
ever its peculiar gaseous quality; and in and through that fluid
the planet, whether by mechanical or chemical attraction or re
pulsion, must be conceived to rarefy, condense, or otherwise
operate.     As the moon is capable of transmitting its influence
through the surrounding medium to the waters and to the earth
.which compose our globe, we may infer that each planet has a
 certain sphere of operation: and however we may suppose the
 energy of that operation to decrease as the distances increase,
or whatever may be the intervening medium, we must allow
planetary is as capable as lunar influence, of exerting its pro

 LXIV.    Some Observations on the Salt Mines of Cardona, made
    during a Tour in Spain, in the Summer of 1814. By
    Thomas Stewart Traill, M.D. Member of the Geological
     Society  *.
 These celebrated mines occupy the head of a small valley in
 the immediate vicinity of Cardona, a town in the province of
 Catalonia.
    This valley extends about half      a mile in length, from the river
 Cardonero to the mines, in a direction from east-south-east to
 west-north-west.       Its north western side is bounded by a very
 steep  and  lofty ridge, the summit of whieh is erowned by the town
 and castle of Cardona.        The opposite boundary is somewhat less
 elevated ;    but both sides are considerably higher than the upper
 surface of the fossil salt.     On entering this valley, the attention
 is arrested by bold cliffs of a greyish-white        eolour, which are
 soon discovered to consist of one vast mass of salt.           The sides
  and bottom of the valley are composed of reddish-brown clay,
 forming a thick bed, from which here and there large imbedded
  masses of rock salt project in the manner of more ordinary
  rocks; especially along the winding ascent which leads up to
 'the town of Cardona.        The summits of the ridges which bound

the vAlley on each side, are formed of a yellowish grey sandstone
 of a coarse texture, and containing many scales of grey mica.
    The great body of the salt forms a rugged precipice, which is
reckoned between 400 and 500 feet in height at the upper ex
tremity of the valley, and is covered by a thick bed of the clay
 above mentioned.
    The precipitous form is partly owing to the manner in which
the mine has been wrought for a series of ages.            There is no ex
 cavation ; but the salt has been procured by working down per
pendicularly as in an open quarry.          The lowest part of the pre
sent works has a solid floor of pure salt which is not above the
 level of the bottom of the valley where no salt is found ; but the
 real depth of the bed of salt has never yet been ascertained. The
 upper surface of the salt is not level ; but appears irregularly ele
 vated, according to the general outline of the hill in which it
 occurs.
    The salt    has been    usually represented as forming an entire
 mountain : but though it here appears supplying the place of
 common rock, yet from its being confined to this valley, and not
 attaining so high a level as the surrounding hills, it would seem
 more correct to consider it as a mass or bed of salt filling up a
 valley, than as constituting a mountain, which according to
 some authors* is a league in circumference.           These dimensions
 could only be obtained by considering the neighbouring heights
 as formed of this mineral; a supposition not countenanced by
 my personal observation, nor by the best information which I
 could collect on the spot.
    The surfaces of the salt precipice which have been long ex
 posed to the weather are not smooth, but cut into innumerable
 shallow channels, running in a tortuous manner, and divided
 from each other by thin edges, often so sharp as to cut the hands
like broken glass. The channeled surface is evidently produced
 by the action of the winter rains, which have given the whole a
 striking resemblance to the surface of a mass of ice, which had
 been partially thawed and again frozen.
    The general colour of the exposed surface is greyish white, with
 here and there a tinge of pale reddish brown, from the colouring
 matter of the superincumbent bed of clay.              Towards the ex
 tremities of the mass of salt, extremely thin layers of a pure and
 plastic clay are insinuated between layers of salt, so as to give
 it the waved delineations which often occur in some species of
 calcsinter.     The general mass of salt is however of the greatest

purity; and in order to      be converted into snow white culinary
salt requires no other process but grinding.        The greyish hue of
the external surface is owing to the rain penetrating a portion of
the salt, and by diminishing its opacity, depriving it of the white
ness which the fresh fracture generally presents.        At the period
of my visit the surface of this immense mass was perfectly dry,
and in some places, where water had most recently flowed, was
covered with a snow-white efflorescence.           This circumstance,
as well as the sharpness of the edges above mentioned, show the
little hygrometric water in the atmosphere of that country, and
the general purity of the salt from earthy muriates.
    The fracture of the salt is highly crystalline, and usually ex
hibits large granular distinct concretions, which give it some
times the appearance of a breccia, or of containing imbedded
 crystals.
    A perennial brine spring flows at the foot of the great preci
pice, and affords a strong proof of the little effect of water on
this very compact salt.      The aperture through which the stream
has issued for many years, is not wider externally than two feet,
and suddenly contracts to a few inches ; while the channel worn
in a solid floor of salt, through which the stream has long flowed,
is not a foot in depth.     This is partly to be ascribed to the water
being saturated with salt; but during the rainy season the
stream is much augmented, and thus cannot be supposed so
highly charged with saline matter. Notwithstanding this, neither
the solvent nor mechanical effects of the spring seem to have
much effect on the fossil salt of Cardona.          The waters of this
spring flow into the Cardonero, leaving in the valley a thick
scaly crust of salt, resembling the ice formed around our brooks
in similar situations.     During the rainy season, it is asserted
that the stream carries down such quantities of salt into the
Cardonero as to kill the fish in that river.       This assertion rests
upon the authority of Bowles, an able naturalist ; but he un
doubtedly was led into error when he asserted, that the waters
of the Cardonero at some leagues below the mines yield no
trace of salt : from which he inferred, that salt may, ly motion,
be converted into earthy matter.         At Manresa, which is about
twenty    miles below Cardona,    I tested the water of the Cardonero
by nitrate of silver, which indicated the presence of an unusually
large portion of muriate of soda.        The taste of the brine spring
at Cardona is intensely saline ; and the hand immersed in        it, on
being exposed to the air,   is  instantly covered with  a  film of salt.
The salt rock near its source    is  most elegantly veined with deli
cate waved delineations of an ochre yellow colour.
    The clay which covers the bed of salt at Cardona and forms
the sides of the valley, exactly resembles the clay found        in the

    pure,  and   free from  intermixture  excepc of salt,   large masses of
    which are occasionally imbedded in it.
       No fibrous salt was to be observed at Cardona ; nor did I dis
    cover the slightest trace of gypsum in that neighbourhood ; a
    remark which- was also made by Bowles.          On the soil near the
    town, a small quantity of a saline efflorescence was however ob
    served, which had the taste of sulphate of soda ; but the loss of
    the specimen I collected, has prevented a more accurate investi
    gation of its properties.
       The salt mine of Cardona is wrought like an open quarry
    with pickaxes and wedges, by which the mineral is raised in
    considerable tabular masses.       The part at present wrought pre
    sents an extensive horizontal floor of pure rock salt ; the level of
    which is a little lower than the foot of the great salt precipice.
    An enormous mass of the same mineral lies between this pre
    cipice and the present mine, the removal of which will, in time,
    render the appearance of this interesting spot still more magni
    ficent; for then the vast front of the rock salt bed will at once
    strike the eye from the lowest part of the mine.
        Like every other public work in Spain, the mines of Cardona
    are in a languid state from the effects of the late war which has
    desolated the peninsula.        Only two labourers are at present
    employed in quarrying the salt, and in wheeling it to, the re
    ceiving house.       Over these, eight overseers are appointed, who
    do duty in rotation ; and ten sentinels are continually stationed
    around the mine to defend it from the depredations of the pea
    santry.     Several clerks are employed in an office built at the
    entrance to the mine, and the whole is under the direction of
    an intendente or inspector, who wears the uniform of an officer
    in the Spanish army; for the mine is the property of the crown,
    and is most rigidly guarded.        Notwithstanding the rigour with
    which depredators are punished, the peasantry frequently at
    tempt to deceive the vigilance of the guardians of the mine.
    When detected, the usual punishment for a peasant           is,  even on
    the first offence, two or three years labour among malefactors
    in some of the public works in the province.       A     soldier  ishow
    ever less severely punished when he commits          a    similar trans
    gression;     heis  generally sentenced to    few days solitary con
                                                   a
    finement in a dungeon of the castle.        On asking an overseer the
    reason of this disproportion in the punishment of different offen
    ders, he replied, that the soldier's poverty was supposed to ex
    tenuate his crime, while the peasant of Catalonia enjoyed com
    parative wealth, and could afford to purchase salt for the con
    sumption of his family.

                       on the   Salt Mines at Cardona.                    329
    Such is the boldness of the smugglers and the jealousy of the
government, that it is dangerous to visit the mines without
formal leave from the intendente ; as the sentinels have orders
to fire on any one seen loitering about them.
    The workmen here receive considerable wages, and are all
free labourers ; each man receives daily twelve reals vellon, which
at the rate of exchange last year equals three shillings sterling ;
lads are paid at the rate ,of eight reals, or two shillings; and
boys receive six reals, or one shilling and sixpence*.             The hours
for work are from six         in  the morning    to  seven    in the evening
 (in summer); with the intervals of half an hour, between eight
 and nine o'clock A.M., for breakfast, and two hours, from twelve
to two, for dinner, and its usual sequel in Spain, the siesta.
    The produce of the mines is pulverized by grinding it in mills,
on the exact construction of our common water mills.                      This
operation     reduces    it into  an excellent  culinary   salt  of  a  snowy
 whiteness.       In this state it is sold to the peasantry of the sur
rounding districts, at the rate of thirty reals vellon, or seven sh.
 six d. sterl. per fanega of five arrobas of Catalonia, which equal
 116 pounds avoirdupois.
    As there are no roads         practicable for wheel carriages in this
 part of Catalonia, the salt is carried from Cardona on mules or
 asses ; the only beasts of burden that could travel in safety the
 rugged defiles in which this district abounds.             It seems a part
 of the perverse policy       of the  Spanish government to discourage
 the formation of proper roads, lest it should facilitate the opera
 tions of the smuggler.
     It would not be difficult to connect Cardona, by means of a
 canal, with the ocean ; and thus the valuable produce of its salt
 mines might increase the revenues of the crown, and the trade
 of Barcelona.        The channels of the Cardonero and Lobregat
 always contain      a  large body of water, and might easily be ren
 dered subservient to the purposes of inland navigation.               Besides
 augmenting the value of the mines of Cardona, such a plan, by
 facilitating the intercourse with the interior of this fine province,
 would stimulate the exertions of a people who only require an
 equitable government to become highly industrious.
     It yet remains that I offer a few remarks on the nature of the
 country around Cardona, as materials for its geology.
     Its general appearance is mountainous.             The mountains are
 abrupt, but generally wooded.              The valleys are narrow, and,
    * This may be considered as liberal wages where the necessaries of life,
 with the exception of bread, are cheap; at Cardona, mutton and beef
 cost one real veil, per twelve ounces.     Bread of the best quality costs one
 real veil, per twelve ounces.     Wine of the country (a very good red sort)
 is retailed at six quartos per bottle, or about two-pence sterling.
                                                                         where

  where the declivities will permit cultivation, they produce abun
  dance of good grapes and some corn.             In coming from Barce
  lona, the traveller leaves, at a small distance on the left, the
  majestic Montserrat ; and gradually approaches a mountain
  chain proceeding from its northern extremity, which declines as
  it stretches towards Manresa.        This chain consists of simitar
  materials to Montserrat; viz. of vast beds of farcilite, composed
  of rounded masses of quartz, with angular pieces of siliceous
  slate, and fragments of clayslate united by a basis containing
  calcareous earth.     The fragments of this farcilite become smaller
  as we go northward, and at last bear a striking resemblance to
  coarse greywacke ; to which formation I am inclined to assign
  the puddingstone of Montserrat, and the chain of which it forms
  a part *.
     On descending the rugged mountains of puddingstone into the
 valley of the Lobregat, before coming to Manresa, we observe
 strata of a blueish-grey rock with interposed lavers of a softer
 material of the same colour, which crumbles into sandy clay by
 exposure to the weather.        These strata have some resemblance
 to sandstone- flag ; but an attentive consideration convinced me
 that they ought to be considered as stratified greywacke ap
 proaching to greywacke slate.         Above these we again find the
 farcilite, which is the prevailing rock? about Manresa.             All the
 rocks hitherto mentioned effervesce slightly with acids ; a cir
 cumstance which connects them in some measure with the ex
 tensive limestone country to the south-west of Montserrat ; and
 they all show a tendency to split vertically into columnar masses.
 Beyond Manresa the farcilite occurs till the traveller crosses the
 ford of the Cardonero, when it is succeeded by a limestone of a
 dirty iron brown colour, and dull, almost earthv, fracture.             Be
yond the village of Suria, a sandstone, which slightly effervesces
with acids, makes its appearance.            This rock constitutes the
sides of the valley which contain the fossil salt.
     The immediate vicinity of the salt mines shows no other rock
than a yellowish grey sandstone much charged with scales of
 mica.
     We find thus that the salt rock of Cardona is accompanied by
 clay and sandstone, like our Cheshire salt formation.                Lime
stone also is found near it ; but the usual concomitant gypsum
    * It may not be improper here to remark, tliat the common
                                                                 descriptions
of Montserrat are in several respects erroneous.       It is not an insulated
mountain, as generally represented; but is the highest point of a considera
ble chain. Its insular appearance, as seen from the high road between
Igualada and Martorel, has deceived those who have never examined its
north-eastern side.   The touchstone, mentioned by Bowles and others, as
entering into the composition of its puddingstone, appears by its fracture
to be only a dark coloured common siliceous slate.

appears to be wanting, as well as foetid limestone.        The great
compactness and purity     of this salt merit examination.
   Though the country around Cardona is mountainous and
rugged, it is inferior in elevation to the districts between it and
the Mediterranean ; as well as to those which bound it on the
north.    Immediately behind Cardona the mountains begin to
ascend with increasing boldness until they unite with the grand
chain of the Pyrenees.
   I relinquish to others the difficult task of giving a probable
explanation of the formation of rock salt ; contented if my ob
servations on the mine of Cardona can add any thing to the
mass of facts which should guide us in the obscure but captiva
ting speculations of geology.
LXV.    Observations on some Combinations of Azote with Oxy
   gen*.     Read to the French Academy of Sciences on the Qlh
  of   Sept. 1815.   By M. Doxong.
Chemistry        sometimes exhibits combinations so difficult to
isolate, and the production of which is accompanied by circum
stances so complicated, that the most expert and accurate ob
servers obtain a knowledge of their properties only after long
efforts and successive labours, in which in a manner they ex
punge all kinds of errors before attaining the truth.      Among
those mysterious compounds we may reckon the combination
of azote and oxygen long known under the appellation of vapeur
rutilante (nitrous vapour, or nitrous acid gas) . Notwithstanding
the numerous researches on this subject, it is only since M. Gay
Lussac's last experiments that the true proportions of it have
been known.        I had myself made some experiments on the
 same subject ; and as my results differ in several respects from
those obtained by M. Gay Lussac, I shall submit them to the
 opinion of the public.
    When we distil neutral nitrate of lead previously dried, we
 obtain a very volatile liquid of an orange yellow, which had al
 ready been remarked by M. Berzelius in his researches upon
 the composition of the nitrates ; but which was examined more
 particularly by M. Gay Lussac, whose researches yielded as a
 result that this liquid ought to be considered as the acid of the
 nitrites, in which the elements are kept in combination by the
 action of the water.     The existence of water in the dried ni
 trate of lead, the proportions of which correspond to those of
 the nitrates perfectly deprived of water, will present a very sin-

   gular exception to the laws of the composition of salts ; and as
   it is rather by analogy than by direct experiments that Gay
   Lussac was led to adopt this opinion, I have endeavoured to
   subject this liquid to a rigorous analysis.
       We may effect our purpose by placing copper or iron, for in
   stance, in contact with the acid in vapour at a red heat.                  In
   crder to avoid the errors which might result from the action of
   the acid on the corks employed in the common apparatus, I had
 ' at first made use of a glass apparatus, all the parts of which
   were soldered ; so that the acid could only be in contact with,
   the glass and the metal which ought to compose it : but I met
   with difficulties during the experiment, which made me recur
   to the employment of a porcelain tube with corks.                 In conse
   quence    of some   precautions  which   it is  needless   to mention   here,
   the only error which can result from it is confined to the ab
   sorption of a very small quantity of acid by the cork; every
   thing being so arranged that nothing could be extricated which
    could complicate the products of the operation.
       The iron or copper in very fine and well polished wires was
    employed in great excess, and all the oxygen of the acid was
    absorbed by the metal; the gas not absorbed afterwards passed
    through a tube of muriate of lime before proceeding under the
    bell-glass which terminated the apparatus.               It is easy to see
    that by determining the weight of the metal, that of the tube of
    muriate of lime, before and after the experiment, and the volume
    of the gas Iterated, we might attain the utmost precision.                  I
    have   made     by this process   several  experiments, the results of
    which have not presented sensible differences.
        In one of those analyses the azotic gas was pure, or at least
    the quantity of hydrogen which it could contain was below the
   limits prescribed by the usual means for detecting it. In general
    the proportion of hydrogen was always extremely small.                  The
    following   are  the details of the  experiment in which the propor
    tion of this gas was the greatest, and in which, nevertheless, it
    formed only the thirty-two thousandth part of the volume of the
    azote :

                         of Azote with Oxygen.                    333
Initiation, it appears to me that it ought to be ascribed to the
humidity of the air, or to that which remains attached to the
vessels, and which it is impossible entirely to get rid of in mani
pulations which are a little complicated.        Besides, this acid is
not exhibited under the orange colour, but when it is anhy-
drated ; for I have remarked that the smallest quantity of water
is sufficient to render it green, as will be explained a little lower
down.      The liquid acid obtained from the distillation of the
nitrate of lead does not therefore contain water, nor does
the nitrate of lead dried contain any.           On calculating the
ratio of the azote with the oxygen in the liquid acid according
to the above results, we find that 100 parts of azote are com
bined with 233-S of oxygen.        These proportions differ very little
from those which we may deduce for the composition of the
nitrous acid gas from the ratio in point of volume which M.
 Gay Lussac has given ; for we fmd, on setting out from this
 ratio, for 100 of azote, 228 of oxvgen.     The identity of the ni
 trous acid gas and of the liquid acid obtained by the distillation
 of the nitrate of lead seemed to me at first so extraordinary, that
 1 thought    some error had slipped into the weights ; but after
 having repeated several times the same experiment, with results
 very little different, there did not remain a doubt as to this iden
 tity! It then became very evident, that the nitrous acid gas
 could not be a permanent gas. In order to verify this inference,
 I made the following experiment :
    I 'placed in two cylindrical reservoirs two bell-glasses with
 cocks, one containing nitrous gas and the other oxygen gas: by
 means of two funnels with stop-cocks, in which water was kept
 constantly at the same level, I regulated the flowing of this liquid
 into the two reservoirs, so that the quantity of nitrous gas dis
 placed by the water in one of the bell-glasses was a little less
 than the doubie of the oxygen extricated, during the same time,
 from the other bell-glass ; both gases severally passed through
 a long tube partly filled with muriate of lime and partly with
  quick lime, and afterwards met in a tube of a larger calibre con
 taining fragments of porcelain: by this arrangement, the gases
 mixing perfectly, they are transformed into nitrous vapour al
  most pure, and merely containing a small excess of oxygen. The
  gaseous mixture afterwards passed into a curved tube, submitted
  to an artificial cold of 20° below zero.       After having passed
  some litres of gas over into this apparatus, I obtained in the
  cooled tube a slightly greenish liquid, sending out into the air
  very abundant yellow vapours, and which was transformed during
  decantation into an orange yellow liquid possessing all the pro
  perties of that which proceeds from the distillation of the nitrate
  of lead, This experiment does not allow of any doubt, and we-
                                                                 ought

334                       Observations on some Combinations
 ought to admit that the compound of azote and oxygen which
 is generally known by the name of nitrous acid gas, is not a gas
 at the common temperature and pressure of the atmosphere,
but rather a liquid which I shall call in the meantime dry or
 anhydrous nitrous acid, to avoid all misunderstanding.
    I found 1'451 for its specific gravity, and 28° for the tem
perature at which it enters into ebullition, the barometer being
 at 0 76"'.
 i. If we have hitherto mistaken the physical properties of this
 combination,, it is because the vapour which it forms maintains
a very strong tension at the common temperature ; and in the
greater number of cases in which it is produced, it is mixed
with permanent gases which prevent its condensation.
    We may easily see from this, that the condensation of the
 dry nitrous acid will be the more difficult, and that it will be
 necessary to employ, in order to produce                  it,

 much the lower as the proportion of foreign gas          greater. This

 accounts for the differences which are observed in the products
 of the distillation of the nitrates. When the base of the salt
 has but     feeble affinity for the acid, and when
             a                                            allows it to be it
 extricated at a low temperature, the nitric acid            decomposed
                                                                     is

                                             ;         we shall suppose
                                                               if
 that these two bodies are set free at the same time, the vapour
 of the nitrous acid forming at least the two-thirds of the gaseous
 mixture,      might be partly condensed, even at the temperature
              it
 of 15°: this      what happens with the nitrate of lead.
                     is                                            When
 on the contrary the base forcibly retains the acid, and precipi
 tates, the having recourse to          very high temperature for the
                                         a

being then reduced into oxygen and azote,            will require con

siderable degree of cold to liquefy even in part the nitrous acid.

 decomposition of the nitrate of barvtes to         cold of 20:l below

into a mixture of oxygen and azote.

very deep green, and much more volatile than the foregoing.                        I
                                                                                  have

                         of Azote with   Oxygen.                    335
have analysed this liquid by the process which I have described
above for the analvsis of dry nitrous acid ; and I found that it
was formed of 100 parts of azote and 207 parts of oxygen, in
weight, in one experiment; in another, I found 216 parts of
oxygen for the same quantity of azote.          It is evident, besides,
from the way in which this liquid has been formed, that water
does not enter into its composition.       The proportion of oxygen
which it contains is less than that of the nitrous acid ; but it is
greater than that which ought to be found in the acid of the
nitrites, which Gay Lussac has denominated pernitrous.
    It is probable, according to this, that it is not a homogeneous
combination, but a simple mixture of dry nitrous acid, and an
other compound of nitrous and oxygen gas, in which the pro
portion of nitrous gas will be much stronger, and this conjec
ture is also supported by the manner in which this liquid acts
during its distillation.    In fact, by submitting it to a gentle heat
the green colour graduallv becomes weaker as the volatilization
is effected, and there remains a variable quantity of dry nitrous
acid.     If the green liquid is not a simple solution of nitrous gas
in dry nitrous acid, it ought to contain another combination of
nitrous gas and oxygen, probably in the proportions of the per
nitrous acid, which it will perhaps be possible to insulate by re
iterated distillations, since there exists a difference, although in
truth very feeble, between the temperatures of ebullition of the
green and the orange liquid. This is a question which I shall
endeavour to decide on account of its importance, notwithstand
ing the difficulties by which it is surrounded.     When we place dry
nitrous acid in contact with a great quantity of water, by im
mediately shaking the mixture it is instantaneously decom
posed ; a proportion of nitrous gas is extricated, which varies
according to the rapidity with which the decomposition is effected.
 If we put, on the contrary, a very small quantity of water with
the same acid, no gas is disengaged; but the acid becomes a very
deep green' : this is what happens when we pour, drop by drop,
dry nitrous acid into any mass of water ; because this acid being
heavier than water, it gains the bottom of the vessel, undergoing
the change of colour just mentioned.         It is evident, from what
 has been said, that the conversion of the orange acid into green
acid, in this circumstance, ought to be ascribed to the decom
position of a part of the dry nitrous acid into nitric acid which
is dissolved in the water, and in nitrous gas which is combined
with the remains of the non-decomposed acid.              Lastly, if we
mix successively with a certain quantity of water various por
tions of nitrous acid* the extrication of nitrous gas produced by
the same weight of acid will always diminish, until it ceases en
tirely, although the liquid continues to absorb nitrous acid. Wt
                                                                    then

 336    Observations on some Combinations of 'Azole with Oxygen.
 then see the water successively become a greenish blue, a dark
 green, and an orange-yellow.         These variations of colour are
 the same with those which have been so long observed in the
 nitric acid of different degrees of concentration, when we pass
 into it nitrous gas of variable proportions.    It seems, therefore,
 that this gas acts, in this last case, by bringing back a portion
 of nitric acid to the state of nitrous acid, and passing itself to
 this state. As to the nitric acid which is found mixed in very
 different proportions with these various combinations of oxygen
 and azote, according to the manner in which they have been
  obtained, it does not seem to affect their colours sensibly; at all
 events, it will not be correct to suppose that these mixed acids
 are only simple mixtures ; for the nitrous acid seems to have an
 affinity for nitric acid, if we judge according to the recent ob
 servations of Mr. Davy, on the properties of the nitro-muriatic
 acid.
    The anhydrated nitrous acid, when placed in contact with a
 strong solution of potash, is decomposed ; nitrous gas is extri
 cated, but in smaller quantity than when the same decomposi
 tion is produced by water: — nitrite and nitrate of potash are
 formed.     With liquid ammonia, the action is extremely violent,
 and the nitrous gas extricated is mixed with azote ; — this proves
 that a part of the ammonia has been decomposed.
    When we pass nitrous acid in vapour over dry caustic barytes
 placed in a tube at the common temperature, the vapour is
 slowly absorbed ; but at a temperature of above 200" the barytes
 suddenly becomes incandescent, and no elastic fluid is extricated.
 The combination which results melts, and is afterwards very
difficult to dissolve : — we therein find once more nitrate and
 nitrite of barytes.   It is certainly a very remarkable phenome
non,    and  the explanation of which is not very easy, to see the
barytes transformed into nitrate and nitrite, at a temperature
which seems to be very superior to that which will be necessary
to decompose those two salts when once formed.
    I have endeavoured to determine the action of the different
combustible bodies on the nitrous acid when reduced into vapour;
but all the phenomena which 1 have observed may easily be
foreseen by the theory, and this saves me the trouble of relating
them.      I shall merely say, that all these experiments confirm
the opinion that the nitrous acid yields, less easily than the eu-
chlorine, the oxygen which enters into its composition : iode, for
instance, may be sublimed into this vapour without receiving
any alteration from it: sulphur and even phosphorus require, in
order to inflame, a higher temperature than in pure oxygen.
   The anhydrous nitrous acid is combined, without undergoing
decomposition, with the concentrated sulphuric acid ; and it is
                                                           probable,

probable, according to the experiments o{ Gay Lussac, and also
those which I have made known, that tiie crystalline substance
described by Messrs. Clement and Desormes, in the memoir in
which they have explained the formation of the sulphuric acid,
is nothing but this combination.
   Since the above memoir was publicly read, I have observed
that the nitrous acid may be presented under very different co
lours, according to the temperature to which it is subjected.
The orange-yellow colour which I have assigned to it in the
course of this paper, is that which it has at the temperature
from 15 to 28: it is deeper the more it approaches its point of
ebullition.   At this temperature it is almost red ; and we know
that at an elevated temperature its vapour is of a very deep red.
But below 15° the colour becomes weaker and weaker, down to
0°, then it is no longer of a fawn yellow; at — 103 it is nearly
colourless ; and finally, at — 20° it is entirely so.          We may
easily produce those different shades by shutting up in the bulb
of a thermometer a certain quantity of dry nitrous acid, the
temperature of which is lowered successively by the evaporation
of ether, or carburet of sulphur.       It will be curious to observe
if the same liquid subjected to a temperature of —40' or —50°
will be presented again under a coloured form ; and if this co
lour will be blue, as indicated by the theory of coloured rings: —
this I shall endeavour shortly to ascertain.                 '
LXVI. Experiments and Observations to prove that the bene
   ficial Effects of many Medicines are produced through the
   Medium of the circulating Blood, more particularly that of
    the Colchicum aulumnale npon the Gout.           By Sir Evkrard
    Home, Bart. V.P.R.S.          Communicated     by the Society     for
    improving   Animal Chemistry*.
 A    knowledge of the readiness with which liquids            pass from
the stomach into the circulation, carrying along         with  them the
impregnation     of different medicines ; and the readiness with
which such medicines are carried off from the circulating blood,
by the action of the kidneys, led Mr. Brande and myself to an
inquiry respecting the prevention of gravel and gout, upon which
 subject he has laid two separate papers before the Society.
    In these communications, the action of different substances
 on the contents of the stomach has been considered, and those
      * From the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1816, part ii.
 Vol. 48. No. 223. Nov. 1S16.                  Y              substances

 33 S              On I he Aclioti  of Medicines, <&c.
 substances most efficient in depriving them of the principal in
 gredient met with in stone and gout, are pointed out.
     For the cure of gout, the eau mcdicinale of Husson has been
 most fortunately discovered to be a specific remedy, and it is
 now ascertained, by experiments on different people, that a
 vinous infusion of the colchicum avtumnale, or meadow saffron,
 is equally so, and therefore the two medicines must be consi
 dered as the same.
     To ascertain their mode of action, appeared to me an inquiry
 connected with the objects of this Society, which are not con
 fined to the knowledge of purely chemical combinations in the
 stomach or other parts of the body, but include the effects of
 galvanism on the nerves, and of mineral and vegetable solutions
 on the blood, so far as they affect the actions of life, or the
 symptoms of disease.
     It has already been determined by experiment, that almost
«very mineral, vegetable, and animal poison, if not the whole of
 them, is carried into the circulation before it produces its spe
 cific effects upou particular parts, whether these are the sto
 mach, skin, or other parts of the body.       The most truly specific
 medicine that we have been hitherto acquainted with, is mercury
 for the venereal disease ; and it is completely established, that this
 remedy, when in the circulation, is equally efficient in the cure
of a recent chancre produced by inoculation, and a venereal
sore throat, in consequence of the disease having been carried
into
  *
       the circulation.
    That other medicines can be received into the circulation,
and, as soon as they arrive there, produce their effects upon dif
ferent parts of the body, is proved by experiments made by the
late Mr. Hunter, although he had no idea of their being usually
carried there before they produce the different actions so well
known to follow their exhibition by the mouth.          He found that
infusions of the following substances received into the circulation
by the jugular vein, immediately produced the same effects which
more slowly follow their being taken by the mouth.         Infusion of
opium brought on drowsiness. Infusion of ipecacuanha vomiting.
Jalap vomiting and purging.           Infusion of rhubarb a profuse
flow of urine.     These effects ceased in a few hours, and appeared
to have in no respect injured the animal's health.         Except the
venereal disease, gout is the only one whose local symptoms
have been completely removed by medicine, in so short a time,
as to put it beyond all doubt that their removal is the effect
or the medicine.      The effect of the euti mtdicinale and of the
vinous infusion of the colchicum autumnale on gout, is indeed
mure rapid than that of mercury on the venereal disease, but fn all
                                                                 other

                     On the Action      of Medicines, &fc.                 339
other respects corresponds with it ; and if these medicines act
through the medium of the circulation, the only difference may
be, that the one is more quickly received into it than the other.
   This power of the eau medicinale, which I have stated to be
exactly similar to that of the colchicum autumnale over the
local symptoms of gout, I have ascertained by experiment more
than six times upon myself ; at one time the symptoms went
off in six hours, at another in twelve, and at others in twenty-
four hours.
   As we know the sensible effects of mercury, whether it is in
troduced into the circulation by the absorbents, or received into
the stomach, are the same, we conclude, whenever these sensi
ble effects are met with, that mercury is actually in the circula
tion.
   It therefore occurred to me, that if the sensible effects of the
infusion of the colchicum should prove to be the same, whether
it is introduced into the circulation by the jugular vein, or re
ceived by the mouth into the stomach, that we might equally
in both cases conclude it to be in the circulation.              To determine
this point, thirty drops of the vinous infusion of the colchicum
(made by macerating two pounds of the fresh roots in twenty-
four ounces of Sherry wine, in a gentle heat for six days, the
spirit being previously carried off by heat,) was diluted with a
drachm of water, and conveyed into the circulation of a mo
derately sized dog by the jugular vein.             The dog's pulse in a
natural state is 140 in a minute.
    In five minutes, the dog had a tremulous motion of the mus
cles and fluttering of the pulse, accompanied with nausea, but
no retching to vomit.         In fourteen minutes, the pulse was 180
in a minute and had frequent intermissions.                In four hours, the
pulse   was  120  in   a minute,   of its  natural   strength, and had fre
quent    intermissions.      In seven   1-ours,    the   dog had a natural
motion, the pulse       had no  intermission,    was    140    in the minute.
The dog had a good appetite for food, and appeared in perfect
health.
   The same dog at the end of three complete days swallowed
sixty drops of the same infusion, exactly double the quantity
that had been introduced into the circulation.               In two hours, he
became languid,      the  pulse wiry  and   weak,   but   140   in the minute.
In four hours and a half, the languor much less and the pulse
natural.     In eight hours, the dog had had a natural motion.
 In eleven hours, was in good spirits and very well.
   The sensible effects upon the dog were similar to those pro
duced upon myself, but in a less degree. Under the influence

into bed, and was so chilly as not to be able to keep my hands
warm, even under the bed clothes.          In two hours, I became
rather   hot and  thirsty.  In  three hours, the pain was so much
diminished as to be tolerable, while the limb was at rest.       In
seven hours, I had a confined motion from the bowels, and the
pain in the ankle became severe, while the foot was placed on
the ground, but this went off as soon as the foot was again
placed in a horizontal posture.        A nausea, or half sickness,
 came on; my pulse, which is naturally 80 in a minute, was
 lowered to 60, and intermitted.      In ten hours, the nausea was
gone off, but I remained languid, the pulse beating 70 in a mi-
 nutev I had some appetite for food.
    The following morning, my pulse was 80, and having passed
 a good night, I was enabled to walk as usual, and follow the
 duties of my profession.
    If these observations shall be confirmed, they must lead us to
 conclude, that the different kinds of substances, whieh produce
 specific diseases, are first carried into the circulation, in the
 same manner as mineral and animal poisons, and that the
 medicines by which they are acted upon, go through the same
 course, before they produce their beneficial effects ; a material
 step will thus be gained-in the consideration of diseases, and the
 modes of treating them.
LXVII. An      Appendix    to aPaper on       the    Effects of   the     Col-

      r.p.R.s*
W hen       I laid before the Society my paper upon this subject,
1 was anxious to establish what appeared to me to be two im
portant facts ; one, that the infusion of the colchicum can be
received into the circulation without producing any permanent
mischief ; the other, that it is through the medium of the circu
lation its beneficial effects upon gout are produced, and there
fore the sudden relief which is experienced can be readily ex
plained.    Having attended to the effects of the eau mSdicinale
gnd of this medicine for several years in cases of gout, both in
my own case, and in those of my friends, I found, invariably,
that they diminished the frequency of the pulse, ten or twenty ->
beats in a minute, and this effect generally took place about
twelve hours after the medicine was exhibited : I therefore con
sidered this to be the criterion of the constitution being under
the influence of the medicine ; and when I found that the pulse

was affected in the same way by the medicine received into th«
circulation, and in a much snorter time, I became satisfied that
in both cases this arose from an effect upon the circulation, and
not upon the stomach, and therefore did not further prosecute
the inquiry; since exhibiting larger doses could only confirm
what is already known, namely, that the medicine is capable,
when injudiciously used, of producing very violeut effects.
     It has been suggested to me since the paper was read, that
the only mode of proving that the medicine acts through the
medium of the circulation, is to show that when a sufficient
quantity is received into the blood, all the violent effects are pro
duced, that result from a large dose taken by the mouth ; and
as I had no ohject but the pursuit of truth, I lost no time in
complying with this suggestion, and introduced into the circu
lation of a dog 160 drops of the same infusion before employed.
    The animal instantly lost all power of voluntary motion, the
breathing became extremely slow, and the pulse was hardly to
be felt.     In ten minutes, the pulse was 84, the inspirations na
tural, which are 40 in a minute.        In twenty minutes, the pulse
was 60, the inspirations 30 in a minute, a tremulous motion had
taken place in the hind legs.       In an hour, the pulse was 115,
and irregular; the animal was capable of sitting up, but was
in a state of violent tremor, and the inspirations could not be
counted.
     In one hour and a half, the tremor had gone off, the pulse
 continued the same ; the animal made ineffectual attempts to
 vomit, and continued to do so for ten minutes, accompanied
-with great languor ; the inspirations were 54 in a minute.
     In two hours, the pulse was 150, and very weak; the animal
had voided one ounce and a half of water, had vomited twice,
each time bringing up a quantity of mucus tinged with bile, and
 had two liquid stools.
     In three hours, had vomited again, and had another stool; the
 pulse too weak to be counted.
      In four hours, continued extremely languid.
     In five hours, vomited some bloody mucus, and expired.
     On opening the body, the stomach contained mucus tinged
 with blood, and its internal membrane was inflamed ; the duo
 denum had its internal surface universally inflamed ; the same
 appearance in a less degree was met with in the jejunium and
 ilium, and more strongly marked in the colon than in the ilium.
     The facts which I have now adduced, afford sufficient proof
 of the action of the colchicum autumnale upon the different
 parts of the body, being through the medium of the circulation,
 and not in consequence of its immediate effects upon the stomach
  and intestines,

                         [Continued    from p. 245.]
The     electrical apparatus, mentioned in my last paper, consists
of about 3,300 groups of zinc, copper, and paper discs, inclosed
in six glass tubes. These are placed in an horizontal position,
each resting upon two insulating rods, which stand seven inches
high above the common base into which they are fixed.                In the
manner of connecting the ends of the tubes there is nothing
new, but in the application of the silver leaf electrometer, there
is a mode which may afford some amusement to those who are
not much acquainted with physical experiments.
    The wire on the top of the electrometer may be placed either
in contact with one extremity of the arrangement of columns,,
as represented in the figure*, or at anymore convenient di
 stance.    The electrometer being placed upon a table in the
middle of a room, and the electrical apparatus in some remote
place, out of sight, it only requires a thin music wire to connect
the apparatus with the electrometer, to cause the pendulums to
vibrate as freely as if the electrometer and columns were in ac
tual contact.
    It has been supposed by M. De Luc and some other writers
on this subject, that the variable action of two electric columns
upon a pendulum suspended between them, is owing to the
moisture contained in the atmosphere ; but others are of opinion
that the temperature of the air, and not moisture, is the cause of
this variation.
    To determine the cause of irregularity in the vibrations of my
pendulums, I made observations several times a-day, for more
than a month, and I find that their vibrations are governed by
the temperature of the air of the place in which the apparatus
stands.    The moisture of the atmosphere, 1 apprehend, could
produce no effect, as the ends of the glass tubes were carefully
closed with sealing-wax.
   The following observations show the effect of temperature
upon electric columns :

    In keeping    register of the variable action of M. De Luc's
                        a
columns, some attention       necessary in adjusting the pendulums
                                    is
to the maintaining power: for        the pendulums be too long, or
                                              if
too heavy, their vibrations will be irregular, stopping at intervals
till the columns have accumulated sufficient power to put them
again into motion.         the columns be sufficiently powerful to
                            If
keep heavy pendulums in regular action when the weather                             is
cold, their vibrations will agree very nearly with the temperature
of the air at all other seasons; but        the pendulums be very
                                                    if
short, they will vibrate too. quickly  for observation.
    The two elements which keep the pendulums in motion corne
from the earth     for when the electrometer
                        ;                          placed in contact

with the copper extremity of the series of columns, no action                       is
produced      but when
               ;             person standing on the floor lays his
                                a
finger upon    the  zinc  extremity, the pendulums will instantly
begin to vibrate, and continue in motion as long as the com
munication with the earth shall remain in the same state.       The
electrometer being removed to the zinc extremity, no action
will commence but let   ;     communication be made between the
                                    a
copper extremity of the series and the earth, and the pendulums
will vibrate as freely as before.
    Although the two elements which keep the pendulums          mo            in
tion come from the earth, yet the variable state of the earth's
electricity has no effect upon them, for they will make the same
 number of vibrations in        given time, the temperature of the
                                     a
 air being the same, whatever the electrical state of the earth
may be.
     It  well known to every electrician that his machine acts
          is
much better at one time than at another.        This has been attri
buted to various causes; but the true one is, the electricity or
the earth     variable, not only on different days, but at different
               is
times     the same day.

that  even contact produces no permanent effect upon the elec
trometer.     On the contrary, the electricity of the earth is some
times so strong, that the tube drawn once through the silk as
before, and held at the distance of four, five, or six inches above
the electrometer, the leaves will become permanently electrified.
   But to obtain a greater degree of exactness than can be de
rived from one electrometer only, 1 make use of five or six, and
after having made an observation by each separately, I take a
mean of their results for the true.     I have kept a journal of the
electricity of the earth by this mode for more than fifteen months,
and found, during that time, such a correspondence among
these instruments, as gives me great confidence in this mode of
investigation.

constantly vibrating for more than two months.           In the year
1813,  I   ascertained that the electric spark consists of two ele
ments of equal mechanical forces passing through each other in
contrary directions*.      In these experiments, the effect was as

instantaneous as the spark itself ; but the effect of the same two
elements, brought into action by the electric columns, may be
 continued at pleasure for months, or even years.
     Now, as all the operations of Nature are produced by general
laws, it is very probable, that all the phenomena of electricity,
 chemistry, meteorology, and the living functions of animals and
 vegetables, are the effects of these two elements.
    This hypothesis (like many others) is easily formed, but the
 investigation of a theory is a work of greater labour ; and may
 perhaps, in this instance, require the assistance of some instru
 ment not yet invented ; for nothing tends so much to enlarge
 the native intellectual powers of man as improvements in the
  arts.

LXIX.    On the Action of detached Leaves of Plants.  By
   T. A. Knight, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter addressed to the
   Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. G.C.B. P.R.S.*
Dear Sir, — Since I had last the honour            to address a com
munication to you,    with  a request  that  yon would   lay it before
the Royal Society, I have repeated great part of the experiments
which formed the subjects of my former letters, with such ad
ditions and variations, as might probably lead to the detection
of any erroneous conclusions which I might have drawn : but I
have not been able to detect any errors, nor to add any thing
very important to my former observations.           I have, however,
been able to ascertain    a few  pew  facts,  which  I think too in
teresting to be lost.
    I endeavoured, in my former communications, to adduce
evidence, that the matter, which becomes vitally united to tree§,
previously passes through their leaves; and I shall now proceed
 to state some facts, which, I trust, will prove that a fluid pos
sessing the power which \ have attributed to the true sap, ac
tually descends through the leaf-stalks.
    A slender knife was passed through some leaf-stalks of the
vine, about two-thirds of an inch distant from their junction to
 the branch; and down to that point, the leaf-stalks were divided
 longitudinally, and a transverse section, about half an inch long,
 was made through the bark opposite the middle of the leaf-stalk.
 A similar transverse section through the bark, was made some
what less than an inch distant below ; and these sections were
     * From    the Transactions   of   the   Royal Society for   1816,   part   ii.
                                                                                united

united  by  two longitudinal sections through the bark, which ex
tended from the extremities of the upper tranverse sections to
the extremities of the lower;       by which means, pieces of bark,
about half an inch broad, and nearly an inch long, were sepa
rated from the adjoining bark. These were then detached from
the alburnum, and surrounded        bytwo folds of paper coated with
wax on each side   ;   by  which all connexion and communication
with the tree, except through the divided leaf-stalks, were cut
off.   The insulated pieces of bark, nevertheless, continued to
grow, and extended downwards, and laterally, and in thickness;
and thin layers of aiburnum were deposited.
   Leaves of the potatoe, without any portion of bark being at
tached to them, were taken from the plants, just at the period
when the tuberous roots began to be formed         ; and    conceived
                                                             I
that these leaves, consistently with my former experiments and
conclusions, must contain portions of the living organizable
matter, which would subsequently have been found in their tu
berous roots.     The leaves were, therefore, planted in pots, and
placed  under   glass, where, being regularly and properly supplied)
with water, they continued to live till winter, though without
emitting fibrous roots  ;   and I  then expected to find some small
tubers at their bases.     In this expectation I   was disappointed     ;
but the result of the experiment was not less satisfactory, the
bases of the leaf-stalks themselves having swollen into conia
bodies of more than two inches in circumference, ana being
found to consist of matter apparently similar to that which com
poses the tuberous roots of the plant.        The enlarged parts of
the leaf-stalks remained alive in the following spring; but whether
they are capable of generating buds or not,    I  have not l>een able
 to ascertain.
    Leaves of mint were planted in the same manner as those
above mentioned    ;   which grew, and continued alive through the
winter, and were still living in the end of the last month, having
assumed the character of the thick fleshy leaves of evergreen
trees.    Upon examining the mould in the pots,           found
                                                             1      to
                                                                   it
contain very numerous roots, which must have derived their me
dullary, and their cortical, and iilburnous substances fiom mat
ter which had emanated and descended from the leaves.
 I    had frequently observed, in former experiments, that the
destruction of the mature leaves of young plants not only sus
pended the growth of the roots, but also the growth of the im
mature leaves  ;   whence   I inferred, in a former communication,
that the organizable matter, which composes the young leaves,
has always undergone a previous preparation in other leaves of

thence led to expect that, under favourable circumstances, the
                                                               mature

            On  the Action of detached Leaves    of Plants.       347
.mature leaves might be made to nourish and promote the growth
of immature leaves, without the aid of roots.        Several shoots of
the vine, each about a yard long, were detached from the tree?,
 and laid over a succession of basins of water, into which each
 of the mature leaves was in part depressed : and thus circum
stanced, the young leaves continued to grow, and the points of
the shoots to elongate; and all were alive and in perfect ap
 parent health at the end of a month.         The water necessary to
 preserve the young leaves must in       this case have been derived
 from the mature leaves ; and I entertain no doubt, but that the
 organizable matter which occasioned their growth, was derived
from the same source.        Intersection of the bark between the
 mature and young leaves was not attended with any injurious
consequences, and the sap must, therefore, have passed to the
young leaves through the alburnum.
    Consistently with the preceding circumstances, if the mature
leaves be destroyed, or taken off, the fruit ceases to grow, or. if
full grown, remains without richness or flavour ; and the power
 of feeding fruits in winter and early spring seems to be confined
to evergreen plants.      The orange and lemon tree, the ivy and
hollv,  afford familiar  examples of this ; and where a genus of
plants consists of evergreen and deciduous species, as that of
mespilus and viburnum, the evergreen species alone nourish
their fruit in winter and early spring.
    The probable passage of the sap from the mature to the young
leaves and fruit may, I think, be easily pointed out, though de
cisive proof of its course will probably never be adduced. Having
often detached the bark from the alburnum of the stems of
voung oaks, just at the period when the midsummer shoots were
beginning to elongate, I observed, as others have done, that a
fluid exuded from those parts of the surface of the alburnum,
which are called (most improperly) the medullary processes, and
from correspondent points of the bark, which resemble the me
dullary processes in organization.       This fluid has been proved,
by its power of rapidly generating an organic substance, to be
the true sap of the tree, part of which I conceive at this period,
to be passing from the bark to join the ascending current in the
alburnum ; which current feeds the young succulent shoots and
growing leaves.      Subjecting the alburnum to a slight degree of
pressure at this period, I found that a considerable quantity of
liquid, being apparently the true sap of the tree, issued out la
terally through the medullary processes, as well as longitudinally
through the cellular substance of the alburnum : but the tubes
of it continued empty, and their position was marked by de
pressions of the surface- of the extravasated fluid.   I endeavoured
to ascertain, what proportion of water a given quantity of the
                                                            alburnum

34?             Controversy respecting Safe-lamps.
alburnum of such oak trees contained at this period; and I found
 that 1000 parts lost by drying only 371 parts: which is not
more than the weight of the water that the cellular substance
appears capable of containing, entirely independent of the tubes-.
 That the tubes, nevertheless, are not always empty, but that
they act at other periods of the year as reservoirs for the sap, I
have given an opinion in a former communication ; and lam
now in possession of facts which prove them to perform this
office, even in the heart wood, to a much greater extent than
 I had ever at any former period suspected ; and which incline
 me to believe, that the durability of the heart wood, as well ss
 of the alburnum of the oak, will be found to depend to a great
 extent upon the period in which the tree is felled : but I propose
 to make my observations upon these points the subject of a fu~
 ture communication.

            LXX.   Controversy respecting Safety-lamps.
 IiAST    month, but too late for insertion in our October number,
 we received from   a respectable correspondent at Newcastle se
 veral articles which have appeared in the Newcastle Courant,
 claiming for Mr. Stephenson priority of invention of the safe-
lamp. — When the invention was first announced, we stated our
 opinion that Mr. Stephenson and Sir Humphry Davy made
 each their discovery independent of each other.      Mr. Stephen
 son's friends, on the contrary, have expressed an opinion that
 Sir Humphry's was derived from Mr. Stephenson's; and in sup
port of their opinion the dates of his experiments have been
brought forward by himself.      Sir H. Davy's friends, resting also
 on dates, have shown that Sir H. was prior,     Of course, if dates
 are to be taken as evidence, not merely of priority of invention,
but as proof that the one who was latest must have borrowed, it
will follow that Mr. Stephenson's lamp was derived from Sir
 Humphry's. — The following are the articles which have appeared
oil this subject in the newspaper to which we have alluded.
       From the Newcastle Courant     of the IQth of October.
    I trust the public, and gentlemen of the coal trade in par
ticular, will excuse my requesting their attention to a letter from

has expressed, and which he has kindly allowed me to publish,
it appears to me may easily be decided ; and I shall only add,
that if it can be proved I took advantage in the formation of
the safety-lamp, of any suggestions except the printed opinions
of scientific men, I deserve to lose the confidence of my honour
 able employers, and the good opinion of my fellow-men, which
 I feel an honest pride in declaring, even in my humble situation
in life, is of more value in my estimation than any reward that
generous but indiscriminating affluence can bestow.

that invaluable discovery is due to that gentleman, or not.     The

applied the principle upon which lamps may be constructed, so
as to be used with perfect safety in mines charged with hvdro-

Saturday, October 21, 1815; but being found not to burn well,
another was ordered the same day, with three capillary tubes to
admit the air, and tried in the mine on the 4th of November
following, and found to burn considerably better, and to be per
fectly safe.   On the 17th of November it was tried at Killing-
worth Office with inflammable air, before Richard Lambert, esq.;
                                                                         '
and on the 24th of November before It. W. Brandling, esq.,
C. J. Brandling, esq. and Mr. Murray.
   On the 30th of November a lamp was tried in the mine, in
which the air was admitted by means of a double row of small
perforations, and found to be perfectly safe and burn extremely
well ; and on the 5th of December it was tried with inflammable
air, before the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle-
upon-Tyne.
   N. B. The lamp which was tried on the 21st of October was'
a considerable time in making (a month at least), owing to the
necessity of having the glass made and well tempered before the
lamp could be begun to be made.

October 181(5, John George Larnbton, esq. M.P. in the chair,
Mr. William Brandling moved (seconded by Mr. Arthur Mow
bray), that the meeting do adjourn until, by a comparison of
dates and an inquiry into facts, it shall be ascertained whether
the merit of the invention of the safety-lamp is due to Sir
H. Davy or George Stephenson ; and the question being put
thereon, the same passed in the negative.
            To the Editor of the Newcastle Courant.
                                    Ui«h Heworth, October 21, 1816.
    Sir, — In answer to the letter and certificates of Mr. Stephen
 son, respecting the Killingworth lamp, in your last week's paper,
 1 will thank you to insert    the following notices respecting the
 progressive  views  and  experiments of Sir H. Davy, on the sub
ject of his safety-lamp.
    On the 28th of August 1815, Sir H. Davy told Mr. Fenwick,
of Dipton, at Auckland Castle, that he intended introducing a
lamp into the coal mines incapable of inflaming the atmosphere
surrounding  it,  and constructed of materials not easily injured.
    Sir H.  continued  in the north of England till the 29th of
September following, on which day he wrote to me, requesting
me to send him a quantity of fire-damp from      blower.
                                                 a        In this
letter he says, " have thought
               I                a  good deal on the prevention of
                                                                  '
explosions from fire-damp, and entertain strong hopes of being
                                1
able to effect something satisfactory on the subject."
   On the I5.th of October, he acknowleged the receipt of the
                                                                 fire-

                  Controversy respecting Safety-lamps.           351
fire-damp, asd said,
                         " My experiments are going on successfully,
and 1 hope in a few days to send you an account of them.             I
am going to be fortunate far beyond my expectation."
     In. a letter, dated 19th of October 1S15, he says " I have al
ready discovered that explosive mixtures of mine damp will not
 pass through small apertures or tubes, and that if a lamp or
 ianthorn be made air-tight on the aides and furnished with aper
 tures to admit the air, it will not communicate flame to the out
 ward atmosphere."
     On the 25 th of October he announced his discoveries to the
 Chemical Club of London ; but he soon " gave up the idea of a
 safety-lamp dependeut upon a diminished circulation of air, be
 cause he found that apertures in the top and bottom only, were
 not safe, unless made so small as to occasion a great loss of light
 hi the flame: i. e. 1 -50th or l-60th of an inch ; and he adopted
 tubes and canals ahove and below, which proved to be safe by
 direct experiment."        In a letter dated October 30, he describes
 a lamp of this kind, and has the ' following reasoning upon it:
  " Atmospheric air, when rendered impure by the combustion of a
 candle, but in which the candle will still Ourn, will not explode
 the gas from the mines ; and when a lamp or candle is made to
 turn in a close vessel, having apertures only above and below,
 an explosive mixture of gas merely enlarges the light, and gra
 dually extinguishes it without explosion.       Again, the gas mixed
 in anv' proportion with common air, I have discovered will not
 explode in a small tube, the diameter of which is less than l-8tk
 of an inch, or even a larger tube, if there is a mechanical force
  urging the gas through the tube."         Some manuscript copies of
  this letter were taken by professional men of this neighbourhood
  on the 2d of November ; and on the 6th of that month I read it
 to a general meeting of the coal trade.
     On the 4th of November, Mr. Butler, in an oration delivered
  at the foundation of the College of the London Institution, no
  ticed the discovery in the following manner: — "At the instant
  I am now speaking science is advancing towards us with an in
  vention which to the latest posterity will prove incalculably be
  neficial to humanity in general and commerce in particular.
  You have read in your uewspapers of the horrid effects of the
  firing of a mine. A very recent paper has given an account of
  such a disaster.     Now within these few weeks, one of those men,
  homines cenlenar'd, as Scaliger called them, who exist hut once
  in a century, men who elevate the country in which they were
  ham, and even the age in which they live, our illustrious country
  man, Sir H. Davy, has discovered a process by which this evil
  principle in nature is absolutely subdued, and all possibility of
  danger from it altogether removed."
                                                                   The

352            Controversy respecting Safety-lamps.
     The regular progress of Sir H's investigations after this tiffiO
 till he discovered a tissue permeable to light and air, but im
 permeable to Jlame, may be seen in hi6 publications on the sub
ject.
     In a letter dated from Whitehaven Castle, 20th of September
 1816 Sir H. pointed out to me a little book, entitled " Elements
of Chemical Science," by J. Murray, Lecturer on Chemistry*,
dated June 1815, in which there are several hints for construct
ing a lamp upon the principle of a diminished atmosphere.
                                                                 "A
lanthorn might be made air tight, and fed through a flexible
tube, &c."       " A division in the tube, or another parallel to it,
would promote a proper current, &c. &c." Mr. Stephenson's
first lamp, which dates its origin from October 21, 1815, was
upon the same principle ; so was that of Dr. John Murray, of
Edinburgh, announced in November 1815; and that of R. W.
Brandling, esq. with the bellows on its top, which appeared soon
after.
   From the preceding statement, compared with Mr. Stephen
son's dates (and even taking into the account the anxious two
months after " he had embraced the idea,") it is evident he was
preceded by Mr. Murray, in the application of one tube, and bv
Sir H. Davy, in numerous apertures and tubes above and below,
for "admitting the hydrogen gas, only in such small detached
portions, that it would be consumed by combustion."
    I believe Mr. Stephenson to be a very modest and a very in
genious man ; and that the first ideas he had of his lamp were
the, effect of his own               on the subject : but when it is
                         reflections
insinuated, as it has been, that hints respecting the Killingworth
lamp were clandestinely smuggled to Sir H. Davy, which led
him to the invention of the wire-gauze safety-lamp, the calumnv
upon his character is not to be borne.        The scientific world are
highly indebted to him for his late discoveries respecting the
nature and properties of flame ; and the part of the population
of this neighbourhood connected with the coal trade, owe him
a mighty debt of gratitude for the successful application of these
discoveries, to lighting the coal-mines cheaply and securelv.
He has, I know, spent a year of great anxiety and labour in the
service of the coal-owners; it      is,
                                      therefore, impossible to sup
press one's indignation, on hearing that doubts respecting his
claims to these discoveries should have arisen among that bodv
of men, especially when his enemies in the scientific world have
been held in silence    by  their astonishment at the novelty and
originality of the  invention.
 I    cannot conclude this letter without observing that         Ihave

hot yet seen a lamp, excepting the wire-gauze one of Sir H.
Davy, which in my opinion deserves the name of a safety-lamp ;
and that this is the decided opinion of persons interested in the
coal trade, is evident from the wire-gauze lamp being used in
exclusion of every other kind, in almost every colliery in this
country, in which fire-damp prevails.

                          Your very obedient humble servant,

             LXXI.    On Vision.    By Mr. W. Pater.
                           To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — IV^r. Horn, in        his Observations on the Cosmogony of
Moses, has been so obliging as to give his ideas on the seat of
vision, concluding "that the optic images are formed by caus
tic reflection and exhibited in the middle of the vitreous humour,
and thus the optic impression and position of the tangible ob
ject are reconciled." I will confess I do not exactly understand
what is meant by caustic reflection, and therefore shall make no
 remarks upon it ; nor should I have particularly noticed the
Other part of the opinion, had it not brought to my recollection
 a correspondence I held with an acquaintance of mine, about
 five-and-forty years ago, who had formed an idea that the eye
 sees objects placed before it without any medium being necessary,
 and th.it light merely renders bodies visible by diffusion over
 their surfaces, he having no notion whatever that the light must
 pass from the surface, or point illuminated, to the eye, to pro
 duce vision.    Now it appears to me that Mr. Horn's theory is
 founded upon some such idea, otherwise where is the necessity
 of supposing that the rays are reflected from the nerve to form
 images in the middle of the vitreous humour? because, if images
 were formed in the vitreous humour, which seems contrary to
 the nature of transparent fluids, still the rays of light must be
 reflected lack again from those images to the optic nerve to pro
 duce vision, because vision is a sensation produced by the action
 of light upon a nerve, or nerves, adapted to receive excitement
 from light.    No part of the body is possessed of sensibility but
 what has nerves, or is nervous, — the nerves alone being sentient ;
 consequently were light capable of being collected in the trans
 parent vitreous humour so as to form images in its centre, still,
  those images could not be perceived there unless the vi
  treous humour were nervous, which is not the case ; and there
 fore, if these images were formed there, the light must be re-

854                  Oft the Possibility  of alloying
fleeted back again to the optic nerve to produce vision, or sen*
satiori, as nothing but nerves is sensible.
    It appears to me, then, that Mr. Horn's theory demands two
reflections which are neither proved, nor necessary, nor con
sistent with the nature of transparent fluids ; and therefore I
 feel inclined to retain my old opinion, that light acts upon the
optic nerve and excites sensation.
     I know the difficulty of getting rid of notions which have be
come habitual, and therefore I suppose my want of conversion
is owing to my having long thought as I do, and to Mr. Horn's
reasons and reflections not being sufficiently caustic to reach my
 case, and produce in me a new and juster way of thinking : at

 LXXII.      On the Possilility   of alloying   Iron with Manganese.
       By David Mushet, Esq. of Coleford, Forest of Dean*.
 I   Have in your last number shown the difficulty of combining,
 to any material extent, metallic manganese with cast iron, by
 fusing the latter with the black oxide of manganese and certain
 proportions of charcoal.       I next attempted to form the alloy of
 the two metals by fusing certain proportions of the ore of each
 metal in mixture, considering that results obtained under such
  a mode of operation, would indicate the practicability of working,
 if necessary or advantageous, ores of manganese along with the
  ordinary ores of iron smelted in our blast furnaces, either for;
  the production of good bar iron or steel.
      I selected a large piece of argillaceous iron ore, which I pre
  pared by roasting and subsequent pulverization ; I then passed it
  through a small wire sieve: the oxide of manganese and char
  coal were prepared in a similar way, and the whole kept shut
  up from access to atmospheric air, to prevent as much as possi
 ble any irregularity in the results by the absorption of moisture.
  The crucibles and lids were accurately ground and fitted to each
  other, and entrely free (by being previously baked) of any coaly
  or extraneous matter.

    Result — A smooth regularly crystallized metallic button*,
Weighing 230 grains, equal to 46 per cent.           On a comparative
examination of the fractures of these experiments, the following
remarks were made.
    No. 1 button possessed a clear metallic fracture inclining td
steel, filed and cut soft, and possessed considerable tenacity.
The grain was flat, confused like steel approaching to cast-iron.
 No. 2 broke with a dark gray blue glance, more perfectly gra
nular than the former, cut softer at first, but possessed less real
tenacity. No. 3 was extremely brittle, and disparted on the first
application of the chisel : — fracture different from the former,
silvery gray, crystalline distinct small grain* and resembled on
the whole some varieties of gray cast-iron.          This difference of
appearance and increase of weight may probably with justice,
be attributed to a small portion of metallic manganese being
reduced from the roasted oxide.       The glass of the first button
was cloudy opaque, though in thin fragments transparent. That
of the second button entirely opaque : but the glass of the third
button with the de-oxidated manganese was amber green,
thoroughly transparent in thin pieces.                       >
    The following experiments were performed          with   an enlarged
dose of charcoal, to compare results with the former.

    The fusion of this mixture yielded a perfect crystallized but
ton of iron weighing 257 grains, equal to 51| per cent.            Glass
lead-milky-blue, veined : eight grains     of charcoal       mixed  with
some brilliant specks of carburet of iron were found unacted
upon.     This fusion was so perfect, and the metallic reduction
so entire, that there did not seem to remain in the glass any
appreciable quantity of iron. The addition of 25 grains of char-

   This mixture       was  accurately fused, and the result was a per
fect metallic button weighing 246 grains, which is equal to
49^ per cent. Glass light green but clouded, transparent in thin
pieces ; not so bright as No. 5, but more transparent than No. 4.
The same quantity of charcoal remained over in this as in the
last experiment.        From the three immediately preceding fusions
with an excess of charcoal, it cannot be decidedly inferred that
the increased produce beyond that of No. i, 2, 3, was derived
from the manganese ; the reverse of this conclusion rather ap
 pears on the face of the experiments, seeing more metal was ob
 tained without manganese than with                   in the proportion of
                                                       it,
 257 to 245 and 246. Lest any error should have taken place in
 the weighing of No.           which yielded 257 grains of iron, this
                                  4,
 experiment was twice repeated, and the results were 240 and
 244, making an average of 245f — Average of the fusions of

     On the whole,           appears doubtful whether in these experi
                             it
 ments there was any real alloy of manganese with iron the so          ;
 litary increase of weight in No.                and its peculiar fracture
                                                   3
 being   the  only  circumstance     in   favour   of this conjecture. On
 dividing    and  comparing      the  fractures    of the metallic buttons,
  No. 4,   7, and    8
                       (the same experiment) were exactly alike.          In
 these no manganese was used             the quality was white cast-iron,
                                           ;
  with blueish glance, and grain indicative of an approach to
      a                                a
  steel.   No.  1  and    2 evidently belonged to the class of steels, so
  far as  a  commencement of grain was visible             but in respect to
                                                                  ;
  ductility  or softness   they were    still closely allied to the hardest
  sorts of cast-iron     :the former had experienced an excess of car
  bon, the latter had absorbed all that was presented to them in
  mixture. No.        5  and No.       were much alike, and similar to
                                       6
  No. 3,   in which de-oxidated manganese was used. The frac

   The metallic button resulting from this fusion weighed 60
grains, or 12 per cent.     The demetallization therefore occa
sioned by roasted manganese is less bv 2 per cent, than when
raw ore is used : this is of course occasioned by part of the
oxygen of the ore being expelled from it in roasting, leaving so
much less to act upon the charcoal of the experiment ; the ex
tent of the decarbonation in both being measured by the lack
of metallic produce when the manganese was employed.              In
No. 19 a metallic deficiency was experienced of 71 grains, a
quantity which required for its reduction 28 grains of charcoal .:
and in No. 20, a loss of 66 grains of iron, which would have, ac
cording to the result of No. 18, required 18 grains of charcoal.
   From these facts it appears to me extremely probable that,
should the ores of manganese ever be introduced into the smelt
ing furnace, a considerable diminution of the carbonating pio-
<perties of the coke will be felt ; or, in other words, less burden
will be carried, and more coke necessary to supply the waste
occasioned by the combination of the oxygen of the manganese
with the fuel. Experiment and practice alone will determine
the comparative advantages and disadvantages that may result
from so novel a proceeding, if ever introduced at our iron
works.                                                               •
   In most ores of manganese there is a portion of moisture and
oxygea that may he expelled at a low heat ; but the greatest
quantity of the latter remains combined with the metal, and from
which the last portions are not easily expelled even in the highest
temperature of the essay furnace.
   The essayist, not having the same means to guide him in fixing
the perfection of his art on the development of a transparent
glass (as  is,or ought to be, the case in operating with ores of
iron) is frequently left in the dark, and puzzled to determine
whether he has obtained the whole metallic produce from the

30 per cent, and upwards of manganese, as in experiments 15
 and 16, will fuse per se into glasses that will transmit light, and
 in thin fragments exhibit perfect transparency. This is not at all
 the case with ores of iron; a retention of 5 per cent, of iron will
give an opaque bottle-green glass, and when it amounts to 10 per
 cent, the glass becomes black, shining, and metallic.

                               To    Mr. Tilhch.
  Sir, —    You     have attached to my name the letters          M.D. This
  distinction I have not assumed, nor do I covet it. I request
  you will rectify the error, lest my more humble efforts in the
  cause of truth and science might in some instances, by my im
  perfect details, detract from the superior merits of Dr. John
  Murray of Edinburgh*.            By a typographical error unhallowed
  is printed   "  hallowed."
       In some instances, by introducing into the flame of a candle
  a spatula of ivory with gunpowder, I have withdrawn it in a
  moist state; and from the circumstance that fulminating silver
  inserted into the cone of flame has not been exploded for some
  seconds, — I deem it probable that the interior is filled up with
  aqueous matter, which emanates from the interior surface of the
  flame, as well as exterior.         This medium of aqueous particles
     * Identity of name

  our excuse.-— Edit,              -
                                                                        would

would account for the extinction of phosphorus, &c. when in
troduced.
    In order to corroborate the solution I have proffered of the
principle of security exhibited in the phenomena of Sir H. Davv'»
lamp, I may remark, that those persons who wear veils are sen
sible of a glow of heat exceeding the common temperature.
Now in this instance the aqueous vapour which evolves in re
spiration fills up the open meshes of the veil, and from the in
terior surface the caloric is reflected back to the face. Either
this is a correct solution, or it is accounted for bv supposing that
the calorific particles radiating in right lines, are interrupted in
their rectilinear path by the fibres of the meshes, and being
thus broken they are confined within the veil : surely the for
mer speaks more the language of fact.
    When the flame of a candle is viewed at a given distance
through a good magnifying lens, it appears composed of a con
geries of flbres wider at bottom, and approximating towards
the summit, where they are bundled or tied together, being no
doubt so many jets of aeriform inflammable matter expelled by
heat.
     Mr. Sym, in the last number of The Annals of Philosophy,
says, that by pressing the apex of the flaming cone the tempera
 ture will be decreased.     This may be naturally expected, and is
 easily explained.     The top of the flame is as it were the focus
 where the fibres of flame are connected.      By pressing upon the
 cone, this focus is destroyed.     The fact of not being able to see
 objects through the upper part of the flame, while they can be
 readily discerned through the lower film, is proof positive that
 flame is transparent under certain forms — here it is attenuated.
     The blue colour at the base of flame is worthy of particular
 notice.    It is likely that the fibres of flame constituting this
 cone are so many capillary tubes into which the volatilized mat
 ter ascends by capillary attraction, and that oxygenous air cir
 culates round the individual fibre.     As they gradually approxi
 mate when they come towards the apex of the cone, there will
 be less and less space for the circulation of oxygen, and conse
 quently the carbon will be more completely consumed toward
 the base than toward the middle or summit : — this will well illus
 trate Sir H. Davy's experiments on flame, which I read with con
 siderable interest..
     If an oxygenous medium obtained in the interior of the cone
 of flame, I see no reason why it should not be a solid column.
  By igniting alcohol, &c. (without a wick) a hollow interior will
 be still found by pressing the apex.
     No doubt in the phenomena of combustion and production
                                                                    of

of water and carbonic     acid gas, the theory of definite propor

    1 feel now anxious to detail to you an experiment which may
serve to benefit the cause of humanity —a cause to which I pro
fess myself warmly attached.         I came from the North on the
top   of the  Glasgow  mail, and   had  " to bide the pelting of the
pitiless storm," the inside seats being pre-engaged from Carlisle.
On the road we encountered a fierce snow-storm. The coach
man and myself were nearly blinded by the unrntermitting flakes,
and the poor animals the horses were as painfully situated, and
expressed as much. At the immediately succeeding stage I pro
cured a piece of black crape, and attached it to the lining of the
hat, so that it himg vertically before the eye.        This I found
not only to prevent the snow from injuring the visual organ, by
warding it off ; but at the same time, by cutting off the adven
titious rays, I was enabled to obtain a more distinct and better
defined view than 1 else should have had.        This provision also
prevented the eye from being dazzled by the reflection of light
from the surface of snow.     C Jrape being an uneven surface, black
lace work with fme open meshes might serve better.
    By mariners at sea, &c. this may be held to merit atten
tion.

Sir, —    A Correspondent        of Dr. Thomson's (Annals of Phi
losophy, June 1816, p. 4fiS), has attempted to demonstrate that
 no part of a circle is a straight line.   It may be supposed that
this proposition is so evidently correct, as to render demonstra
tion unnecessary. But however absurd the idea that curves are
composed of small right-lines may appear, it               is,
                                                     either directly

that a circle        composed of small

   The Doctor commences             stating, that the most eminent of
                                                        by
the Greek philosophers supposed the ultimate elements of matter
to consist of atoms or particles incapable of further division or
diminution and that this doctrine was adopted
                      ;                                          Sir Isaac             by
Newton, and        many      by
                           celebrated     philosophers   since   his  time.

364                      On the Origin         of the Atomic Theory,
chemistry as it passed through the hands of different philoso
phers. He particularizes Cullen, Black, Cavendish, and Priestley j
whom we must ever revere with grateful feelings for their suc
cessful labours in the field of science.
   To each of those philosophers, except Dr. Cullen, who was
before my time, I had the pleasure of presenting a copy of my
"Comparative View of the Antiphlogistic and Phlogistic Theo
ries," printed in-the year 1/88, and published early in the year
1789.
    In writing this work, happily for chemistry, arose during my
investigation of the two antagonist theories the Atomic System,
or more properly speaking the doctrine of Definite Proportions,
in which the elementary particles of matter are capable of uniting
so as to form atoms and molecules*.
    My atomic theory of chemistry is so mathematically correct,
that all visionary hypotheses fell prostrate before         and      wasit,         it
from     alone that the phlogistic doctrine received its fatal blow.

                              as the following extract, taken from the
 fourth volume of the Analytical Review, page 178, will show:

 of chemistry, which prove him to be eminently qualified for the

though       we here and there meet with inaccuracies which denote
he is not yet familiarized to the art of composition.                 The che
mical reader will readily form an idea of the facts contained in
the sections whose titles we have enumerated.                 They consist irt
a great measure of those which we have already mentioned in an
 account of the French edition of Kirwan on Phlogiston*: the
 statements however are very different, and the' elucidations both
 of theory and matter of fact are in many instances original and
 striking. We do not therefore hesitate to recommend this per
 formance of Mr. Higgins, as a work well deserving the attention
 of chemists : but as it would lead us too far into chemical dis
 quisition to follow him step by step in the enumeration of facts
 and display of arguments which cannot be abridged, we shall
 conclude this article by another quotation ; in which as much
 appears to be said and done to establish the composition of
  water against the late experiments of Dr. Priestley as the pre
 sent state of the subject appears capable of."
      In about twelve months after my book appeared, Dr. Priestley
 was the only phlogistian in England, and he retained his old
  tenets to the last moment of his life.              I do not recollect the
  exact time Dr. Black recanted, it was after Kirwan.                 Mr. Kir
  wan, the formidable champion of the phlogistic doctrine, re
  nounced it as soon as he read my book, and declared in the
  presence of many philosophical gentlemen now living in Dublin,
  that it was that work ulone induced him to change his opinion,
  and that nothing the French philosophers brought forward had
  any influence on him; this appears from his notes in answer to
  the French at the end of the English translation.
      Dr. Thomson tells us in the fourth volume of his Annals,
  p. 54, that it was the answer of the French chemists to Mr.
  Ktnvan's Essay on Phlogiston that decided this memorable con
  troversy.       Nothing can be so incorrect or so unjust as this as
  sertion: for the answer was published before I wrote; and from
   the foregoing statement, which is a true one, it is evident that
   it produced little or no effect ; and it appears by the extract
   from the Analytical Review that my demonstrations were consi
   dered as original at the time I had written f. These were my
   principal motives for introducing the foregoing subjects.
       But to return to the outlines of the Doctor's history. He at
   tributes, and very justly, the first rudiments of analytical che-

    and that is one  of my principal reasons for inserting it here, as will imme

                                                                           mistry

 3G6             On the Origin   of the Atomic   Theory,
 raistry to the labours of Margraaf, Bergman, and Scheele.        Kir-
 wan, Bergman, and Wenzel distinguished themselves by the
 analyses of the salts.   They ascertained that salts and all com
 pound     bodies are united   constantly in the same proportions of
 their constituents.
    The foregoing philosophers had written long before me; and
 I challenge Dr. Thomson to produce a single page from their
 respective works that relates to the atomic theory, or, in other
 words, to the definite proportions in which elementary particles
 unite so as to form atoms and molecules.
    From the foregoing philosophers the Doctor passes to Richter,
 who analysed saline bodies with still greater accuracy than his
 predecessors.     He ascertained the quantity of the earths and
 alkalies necessary to saturate 100 parts of different acids.      As
 the labours of this chemist do not relate to the atomic theory, I
 consider it unnecessary to attend to them minutely.
     Had Dr. Thomson been a faithful and unprejudiced historian,
 he would have had the candour to mention my Comparative
  View, and the discovery of the atomic theory, before he brought
 forward the labours of Richter, which were subsequent to mine.
    Next in the order of this curious history, Proust (no doubt a
 chemist of considerable merit) is introduced.        From the great
 attention which he paid to metallic oxides, he was able to prove
 that every metal is capable of forming a certain determinate
number of oxides, and no more. " Thus, zinc unites but to one
 dose of oxygen ; consequently there is but one oxide of that
 metal : iron, arsenic and antimony form two each : tin forms
 three."
    In my Comparative View, written many years before the work
of Proust, it will be found that I considered metals in gener&l
to be capable of uniting to different doses of oxygen, and that
the force of union was in the inverse ratio of the number of doses
which they took in*.       I mention these circumstances merelv
to show that I developed principles only, for I had not attended
to the different doses of oxygen to which the different metals
were capable of uniting. These circumstances ought to have
been mentioned : but this would frustrate the Doctor's purpose,
that of bringing Dal ton in as an original discoverer of the atomic
theory.
    " Such was the state of the subject," continues the Doctor,
" when Mr. Dalton turned his attention to the combinations of
bodies with each other, about the year 1804."            Mr. Dalton's
first volume of the Atomic Theory made its appearance in 1 SOS.
   *  I refer to my Comparative  View, or to my Atomic Theory, on this
subject.
                                                                 The

                0»   the    Origin   of the Atomic   Theory.              367
    The Doctor acknowledges with wonderful candour, that it
was known at this period that hydrogen unites only in one pro
portion with oxygen ; that carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus
unite in two proportions ; and so he goes on enumerating other
combinations long known before this period.
    It would be needless to follow the Doctor through all his de
tails, most of them being well known ; and many misrepresen
tations are brought forward, in order to prepare the way for his
ingenious friend to take possession of the Atomic System.
    The proportions in which inflammable substances and oxy
gen are found to unite, such as 1 and 1, or 1 and 2, &c. by
weight, " led Mr. Dalton to the lucky idea that the atoms of
bodies unite together ; that the atom of each body has a deter
minate weight, and that this weight regulates the proportion in
which bodies combine.        Let us suppose, for example, that water
is formed by the union of one atom of oxygen with one atom of
hydrogen; it follows, as the oxygen in water is eight times that
of the hydrogen, that the weight of the atom of oxygen is to
that of an atom of hydrogen as 8 to 1 .        So that if we represent
the weight    of an  atom  of  hydrogen by 1, that of an atom of
 oxygen will be 8." The Doctor adduces many more examples
of this kind, which first appeared in my Comparative View, as
6hall be presently shown.
     "But Mr. Dalton," continues the Doctor, "not satisfied
 with this simple and luminous explanation, which threw a new
 and strong light around chemical combinations, which afforded
 the means of correcting and checking chemical experiments
 hitherto conducted without any guide, and promised in time to
 introduce mathematical precision and mathematical reasoning
 into a science which hitherto has been able only to boast of
 analogical and probable conclusions              contrived a set of
 symbols to represent the different elements, and make the nature
 of the combinations which they form obvious to the eye of the
 most careless reader."      An engraved specimen of those symbols
 is given, so far as they relate to the ultimate particles of hydro
 gen, azote, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, and oxygen.              The
  symbols representing the inflammable particles or bases are
 united to those representing particles of oxvgen in the propor
 tion in which they are capable individually of combining with
  that element, that  is,

                          The Union    of   Oxygen and Hydrogen.
        1.  Two volumes of hydrogen unite to one volume of oxygen,
    and in no other proportion whatever.
        2.  The two volumes of hydrogen contain the same number of
    ultimate divisions or particles that       contained in the one of

  particle of sulphur was of the same weight with that of the oxy

  of the acid atom was as large as that of the ultimate particle of
 oxygen -before the union.

                  representing this combination, with numbers ex
 pressive of the force of union comparatively with that of the
 constituents of water," is given.
      2. An ultimate particle of sulphur is capable of uniting to
  two ultimate particles of oxygen, and the compound is an atom
 of sulphuric acid. These are the defmite proportions in which
 those two elements can unite.
      3. The two portions of oxvgen are united with less energy in
 the sulphuric acid than the one proportion in sulphurous acid.
 A diagram with numbers representing this difference was intro
 duced.
                          Metals and Oxygen.
     The ultimate particles of some metals, — 1 instanced iron, —
 attract oxygen with greater force than those of sulphur or hy
 drogen do.       This superiority of force was also expressed by
 numbers.
      The relative forces with which the foregoing inflammable
 bases attracted oxygen, and the diminution of this force by double
 doses of oxygen, enabled me to calculate the changes and dif
ferent phenomena which are produced by metallic subtances when
 exposed to the action of sulphuric acid, dilute sulphuric acid,
 and sulphurous acid.       It enabled me not only to point out the
 absurdity of the phlogistians, but also the errors of the antiphlo-
gistians themselves.      What I here assert will be found verified
in my Comparative View, or in my Atomic Theory.
                          Azote and Oxygen.
      1. One ultimate particle of azote and one of oxygen chemi
cally united constitute an atom of the gaseous oxide of azote.
     2 When united to two of oxygen an atom of nitrous gas is
 formed.
     3. When the particle of azote is united to three particles of
oxvgen an atom of the red nitrous acid is formed.
     4. When the azote unites to a fourth particle of oxygen an
atom of the straw-coloured nitrous acid is the result.
     5. When united to a fifth particle of oxygen an atom of nitric
acid is formed.       These are the defmite proportions of oxygen
and azote.
     All the foregoing distinct compounds of azote and oxygen, and
the different forces with which they retain their oxygen, are re-

370             On the Origin   of the Atomic Theory.
presented by diagrams ; the energy of union gradually and re
gularly diminishes from the minimum to the maximum state of
oxygenation.     Each of the atoms of even the nitrous and nitric
acids in the liquid mass are distinct from one another, as being
surrounded with their respective atmospheres of caloric.
   When the foregoing compounds produced by the union of azote
and oxygen are mixed, a partial decomposition takes place, and
the oxygen is divided between them ; but that which contains
1 and 2 can take none from         1 and 3, but it will take from
1 and 4, and 1 and 5, or 1 and 3 can take from 1 and 5, but
not from 1 and 4.
   Nothing could be more easy than to deduce the weight of
those atoms from the relative weights of their constituent gases.
   This arrangement and calculation of the force of union of the
constituent elements of the nitrous gas, of nitrous acid and nitric
acid, enabled me at that remote period to demonstrate with ma
thematical accuracy all the chemical effects produced on those
acids by inflammable bodies, which were not understood before.
                     Nitrous Acid and Potash.
   A  single atom of nitrous or nitric acid unites to a single atonv
of potash, and this molecule is surrounded with an atmosphere
of caloric which renders each molecule in the saline mass inde
pendent of each other.      This holds good with respect to all
other saline substances.
                       Metals and Oxygen.
   The ultimate particles of a metal unite with different doses
of oxygen : the first dose is retained with greater force than the
second ; and this last with greater force than a third dose.    Tin
was adduced as an example in my Comparative View.
                         Metals and Acids.
   Metals, or rather their oxides, unite with acids atom and atom
so as to form molecules, and the force of union depends on the
kind of metal.    I have shown that the metals first unite to oxy
gen, and that their ultimate particles are supplied with it at the
expense of the water, or of a portion of the acid itself.     To il
lustrate this point diagrams were produced.
   The precipitation of some metals in their metallic state from
their solution in acids by other metals had been explained upon
strict mathematical principles, by means of diagrams, and each
ultimate particle was allowed its full force and effect in the ope
ration, agreeably to the laws of the atomic doctrine.     When one
metal precipitates another metal from its solution in a semi state

oxygen than the precipitated : this was also explained on the
atomic principle.
    The foregoing short sketch comprehends nearly the whole of
the atomic theory, or of definite proportions.           Its application
in chemical researches is a secondary business.          No theory can
be confined to the labours of its author.          The great excellence
of a doctrine depends on its capability of being universally ap
plied throughout the whole range of chemical science, — a task
 too great for any individual.

     It was noticed that an error has been published in the Nautical /
 Almanac, of the part of the sun's disc, where the first impression
 would-be made, being 59° from the vertex.                     The primary con
 struction   of   a  solar eclipse being      made    on  the   ecliptic, I am of
 opinion, that it is computed for the vertex of that plane ; which
 should have been so explained.              When vertex is mentioned with
 out reference to the plane, we generally suppose it to be the vi
 sual vertex on the plane of the horizon.                 The immersion hap
 pened    about    half  a  minute     later    than   computed, and as the
 moon was decreasing          in north latitude the impression would be
 further from the vertex : on the plane of the ecliptic the angle
 was 64" 55', on the plane of the equator 5 1° 36', and on the
 plane of the horizon 20° 37'.
     The undulating stream of light round the disc of the moon
 should seem to indicate an atmosphere on the surface of that
 body; and also the disc did not appear -to be perfect, but ser
  rated; both which circumstances were rendered more observa
  ble from the intense light of the sun.
      This eclipse has been total in the northern parts of Russia, on
  and near the meridian ; since the moon's diameter exceeded that
  of the sun.

   quids, and  elastic Fluids, and on the exact Measurement of
   Temperatures.      By Messrs. Dulong and Petit.       Read to
   the Institute 29lhafMay 1816*.
w     hen we endeavour to scrutinize most of the questions re
lative to the theory of heat, our progress is soon arrested by a
difficulty   which reappears at every step under different forms.
What     are we to understand by the word temperature? and what
is the relation which exists between the indications       of the ther
mometer and the quantities of heat added or subtracted, in or
der to produce determinate variations in the temperature ? Here
are two questions which must be resolved ere we can find, for
example, the true laws of cooling : and it was. in fact, in order
to solve them, that we embarked in the inquiries, a part of
which we now submit to the judgement of the Class.
   The construction of all the instruments destined to measure
temperatures rests on the property possessed by bodies of
changing their volume by the action of heat ; but these instru
ments, in order to be rigorously exact, ought to satisfy two con
ditions equally indispensable.       The first                      is,
                                                     to be capable of
comparison with each olher,        e. to agree always in their indi
                                            i.
cations     the second
            :                    is,
                            to be comparable with themselves,          e.                       i.
to have      course which shall be in
             a                            known ratio with the vari
                                                       a
ations of temperature.
   The first of the^e conditions maybe now obtained with great
exactitude.      We know well all the causes which can influence
the justice of the indications of these instruments, and            em                     by
ploying   the  proper  precautions  we   may  attain    precision  suffi  a
cient for all observations.
  It   ismuch more difficult to satisfy the second condition, which
consists in establishing      graduation" in which the equal parts of
                                   a
the scale answer to equal variations of temperature.         In fact, in
order to fulfil    completely,
                     it               not sufficient to determine the

which we employ, to the quantities of heat which we communi
cate to     itwe must also ascertain that the capacity of this sub
                :
stance for heat does not change, or at least keep an account of
this change         takes place.
                    if   it        The extreme difficulty of deter
mining with precision how the specific heat of             body varies,       a
particularly at high temperatures, may be regarded as one of
the greatest obstacles to the direct solution of this question.
   Experimentalists,    however, have made some attempts to at
tain it.   De Lue,   who  was the first, and     perhaps the only one

who took up the subject, supposed that the capacity of water does
not vary between 0 and 100°; so that, by mixing two equal
masses of this fluid at different temperatures, he took for that
of the mixture the mean of the temperatures of the separated
masses.
    Mr. Dalton thinks that it is not equal masses which must be
mixed, but rather equal volumes ; because he supposes that the
capacity of the same mass increases with the temperature in
proportion to the volume which it acquires ; or, in other words,
he supposes that the capacity of bodies referred to their volume
will remain constant.       It is very easy to prove that the specific
 heat of the gases, and even of the liquids, undergoes variations
In the ratio indicated by Mr. Dalton \ but we do not fmd in the
work of this eminent philosopher any experiment in support of
 the law which he seeks to establish.
     We see that the researches hitherto set on foot on the true
 gradations of a thermometer are reduced to very little, and we
 may even add that no person has undertaken direct experiments
 to ascertain them beyond 100°.
     After having compared with each other the different experi
 mental methods which may be employed in order to attain the
solution of this important question, we have thought that the
 determination of the quantities of heat, particularlv at high
 temperatures, was not susceptible of sufficient precision.           We
 thought   it preferable to  compare,  in the first place, with the  mer
 curial thermometer the progress of the dilatation of bodies the
 most homogeneous, and of such a nature that the causes which
visibly affect the uniformity of the dilatation should have no
 influence over them.      These bodies ought evidently to be taken
from among the gases, or from among the solids endowed with a,
 great infusibility. The experiments of M. Gay Lussac having
 taught us that all the gases are dilated exactly m the same way when
  they are placed in the same circumstances, it is natural to con
  clude that the dilatability of one and the same gas ought to be
  constant, and that consequently, at increments equal in volume
  or in elastic force, they ought to answer to equal increments of
  temperature.
     It was by setting out from this principle that M. Gay Lussao
  ascertained that the march of the mercurial thermometer was
 regular between the freezing and boiling points.
     Experimentalists are pretty generally agreed in regarding the
 dilatation of solids which are very difficult to melt as being uni
  form.    The experiments of Messrs. Laplace and Lavoisier on
  the dilatation of most of the metals between 0 and 100° come
 in aid of this opinion.
     Now, if bodies so different as the metals and the gases fol
                                                                    lowed

and elastic Fluids, and   on  I he Measurement of Temperatures. 375
lowed the same course in their dilatations, it will become extreme
ly probable that these dilatations will indicate the true tempera
tures : this is what might besides be verified by the correspond
ing quantities of heat. By following this course, we shall have
the advantage of bringing into the determination of the true
thermometrical scale, all the precision which we may now give
in the measurement of dilatations; and these measurements them
selves, independent of the important consequences which we
might deduce from them relative to the theory of heat, will pre
sent data which will be useful under several circumstances,       Such
are the considerations and the motives which determined us to
commence our labours bv the comparison of the dilatations of
the gases and the solids with the mercurial thermometer in high,
 temperatures.
 Comparison    of the Dilatation of     the Gases and  of the Progress
                   of  the mercurial    Thermometer.
    The apparatus which we used was composed of a rectangular
tub of red copper, seven decimetres long, one decimetre broad,
and a decimetre deep.        This tub has on one of its lateral faces
two openings, one of which serves to introduce, in a horizontal
situation, a mercurial thermometer, and the other holds the open
extremity of a tube which is placed horizontally at the same
 height with the thermometer.          This tube is perfectly dry, and
contains air which is dry also.
    The tub rests on a furnace constructed in such a manner as to
 heat all parts equally.         It is filled with a fixed oil, which
 may,  as we know, support       a temperature of more than 300 de
 grees without boiling.      The tube which contains the air is ter
 minated on the side of the aperture by a short tube of a very
 small diameter, which partly issues from the tub.          The quan
 tity of air contained in the exterior portion of this tube, and
 which does not participate in the heating of the rest, is not
 worth noticing.     We ascertained that it never exceeded a two-
 thousandth part of the total mass ; and besides, we had the pre
 caution to heat it during every experiment, in order to reduce
 the error which might result from it.
    The tub is covered by a lid pierced with several holes: some
are traversed by thermometers, which serve to indicate if the dif
 ferent parts of the liquid mass are at the same temperature; the
others have stalks or sticks terminated by vertical plates of cop
 per, which we can turn ; we thereby produce in the liquid a
 brisk agitation, the object of which is to establish the uniformity
of temperature.
    The following    is the course pursued by us in every experi-
                                  A a4                           ment.

  376 Inquiries into the Laws      of Dilatation of Solids, Liquids,
  ment.     We heated, in the first place, the tub to a temperature
  little inferior to that which we wished to obtain, and we after
  wards closed all the apertures of the furnace.       The equilibrium
  of heat tending then to be established throughout the whole
  heated mass, the temperature of the oil still rose some degrees,
  and soon attained its maximum, where it became some time
  stationary, and consequently easy to measure with precision.
  It was then indicated by the horizontal thermometer, which was
  sunk sufficiently in the oil, in order that the whole column of
  mercury should be inserted in it: at the same instant we closed
  by means of the blowpipe the fine point of the external part of
  the air-tube, and we noted the barometrical height.       This being
  done, we withdrew the tube and carried it into a separate cham-
- ber, the temperature of which was nearly invariable : we placed
  it vertically, and in such a way that the point entered a mer
  curial bath perfectly dry.     We broke this point in the mercury,
  and this liquid ascended until the equilibrium was established
  with the external pressure : we left it in this situation a suffi
   cient time to give it precisely the temperature of the room,
  which we knew with great precision bv means of a very sensible
  thermometer suspended beside the tube.          When the equilibrium
   of temperature was perfectly established, we measured, by
  means of a vertical scale fitted with an index, the height of the
   column raised in the tube.      We observed at the, same time the
  barometrical height, and the difference of these heights made us
   acquainted with the elasticity of the cold air.       We then with
   drew the tube, by taking all necessary precaution to retain the
   mercury of which the column that had been raised was com
   posed.    The tube and the mercury which it contained were
   weighed: we afterwards weighed this same- tube successively
   empty and entirely full of mercury; by subtracting from the
   result of this last weight those of the first two, we had the weight
   of two equal volumes of mercury, the one with the volume of
   hot air and the other with the volume of cold air ; and from
   these weights we inferred the volumes themselves, which we
   afterwards brought to what they would have been under the
   same pressure, since we knew the elasticity of the cold air which
   had been measured as we have indicated, and that of the warm
   air which was equal to the pressure of the external air observed
   at the instant of closing the tube.
       In order to judge more easily of the degree of confidence which
   the results deserve to which we had been led, it will not be un
   availing to give some details relative to the precautions which we
   took in every experiment.      One of the greatest obstacles which
   we meet with in this description of inquiries is awing to the dif
   ficulty of establishing a perfect uniformity of temperature in a
                                                                    great

great liquid mass 200 or 300 degrees warmer than the surround
ing air.    We attain this rigorously when the temperature at
which we operate         is,
                        for example, that of the ebullition of the        li
quid which we employ then this temperature
                               :                   is  necessarily fixed   ;
but in every other case the progress more or less rapid of the
heating or cooling of the different points of the mass, opposes the
necessary uniformity from taking place. We are of opinion, how
ever, that the arrangement of our apparatus remedies in          a  great
measure this kind of inconvenience, and this      is  owing, on the one
hand, to the copper tub being sunk in the furnace, and composing
with ita considerable mass, which   is cooled slowly, particularly when
it    near its maximum of temperature; and in the second place,
     is
the liquid being continually agitated, the heat ought to spread
through      more uniformly.
                it                 In short, to remove all doubts, we
inserted into this tub two thermometers situated horizontally at
the same height we had raised the temperature in the same way
                     ;
as in our ordinary experiments, and we ascertained that                    by
shaking the liquid the thermometers never differed but           by   few
                                                                      a

   Besides, even supposing that the different particles of the liquid
layer which surround the air-tube were not exactly at the same
temperature, the error will not be so great as at first believed           ;
for,    consequence of the arrangement of the apparatus, the bulb
          in
of the thermometer nearlv answers the middle of the length of
the tube, and consequently this instrument ought           inall cases to
indicate    temperature
                a          not far from the mean   of  he
                                                       t  different parts
of the tube. We ought to recollect also, from what has been
said, the necessity which there is, in order to know the true indica
tions of the thermometer, to sink    it  sufficiently in the liquid, that
the whole column of mercury should enter it.           This precaution,
which appears to be unnecessary in low temperatures, ought not
to be omitted in high temperatures; for then the column of mer
cury contained in the tube may undergo an increment of very sen
sible length.   Thus we have remarked that, at the temperature of
300° for instance, there was frequently more than 15° of differ
ence between the indications of one and the same thermometer,
whether the whole of the mercury was in the liquid, or the bulb
only entered it.    We might indeed, according to our knowledge
of the dilatation of the mercury, estimate the error which we com
mit      plunging only part of the thermometer into it; but the
           by
correction to make       this case, bearing on considerable numbers,
                         in
will occasion serious errors, because we never know exactly the
mean temperature of the mercury contained in the tube.            It  ap
peared to us to be preferable in all cases to place the thermome
ters horizontally.    In order to give    a  more precise idea of the
various operations of which each of our experiments         iscomposed,
                                                                       we

approximating 100', although we have repeated several times the

not propose by any means to verify therebv a determination on
which no doubts can be entertained ; but the coincidence of our
result with that of M. Gay Lussac has been for us the best proof
of the rigorous exactitude of the process which we made use of.

taking mediums, we have formed the following table, which indi

   Although the experiments which we have given present a re
markable coincidence, we thought it right to attempt the attain
ment of the same results by a different route.
   In these new experiments we made use of an air-tube of a
much greater capacity than in the first, and we placed it in the
same way ; only the very narrow tube which was soldered to it
was curved at its issuing from the tub, and prolonged vertically
for the length of almost five decimetres : it was heated by taking
                                                                               all

and elastic Fluids, and on the Measurement               of Temperatures.      379
all the precautions which we have mentioned ; and when we had
attained the stationary temperature and had noted the baro
metrical height, we conveyed under the inferior extremity of the
vertical tube a capsule full of very dry mercury : the tube was al
lowed to cool until the oil had resumed nearly the temperature of
the air.      During the continuance of this cooling, the mercury
 ascends into the vertical tube, and does not stop until the air con
 tained in the tube is completely cooled.              The elastic force of this
 air is then equal to the external pressure of the atmosphere di
 minished by the height of the column raised up : that of the warm
 air was equal to the barometrical height observed at the instant
 when the temperature was stationary.               We might therefore con
 clude, by means of the law of Mariotte, what would have been the
 dilatation of the air if it could have been dilated.                   In order to
 render this process completely exact, we ought to have kept an
account of the capillarv depression which the mercury undergoes
 in the straight tube into which it had risen. This depression had
 been measured beforehand, and care had been taken to make
 choice of a tube of such a calibre as not to admit of its varying
 sensibly.
      In the second place, the volume of air did not remain exactly
  constant ; the portion comprised in the vertical tube re-entered
 in part into the great tube, in proportion as the column of
  mercury rose, and this portion of air did not sensibly change its
  temperature.         It became necessary to calculate the influence of
 these two causes, and make our observations undergo the correc
  tion flowing from it. This correction depended on the relation of
  the capacity of the large tube with that of the small ; the calcu
 lation which gives it is besides too simple to render it necessary
  to indicate it.       We shall now give the results of one of the series
  of experiments made by this new process: all of them agree with
  the observations made by the first means, and they have entered
  into the determination of the mean measurements formerly re
   lated.

380      Inquiries into   the Laws of Dilatation     of Solids, &c.
   The results which we have made known inform us that the
dilatation of the mercury in the thermometer follows a more
rapid course than that of the air ; so that, if we regard the latter
as necessary to serve for the exact measurement to the tem
peratures, we ought to conclude that the indications of the mer
curial thermometer are too high in the temperatures superior to
that of boiling water, and the numbers winch we have given
might serve to make these indications undergo the proper cor
rections.    Those numbers increase besides in a sufficiently re
gular manner, in order that we may without sensible error de
termine the correction relative to the temperatures intermediate
to those which are comprehended in the table.
    This conclusion destroys a doubt which was raised with re
spect to the law of dilatation of the gases.        This law had not
heen announced in the same           way  by Messrs. Gay Lussac and
Dalton, whose experiments on the subject now before us ap
peared at the same period.         The experiments of M. Gay Lussac
proved    that the dilatation   of the gases referred to the mercurial
thermometer is for each degree a constant fraction of the volume
 at a determinate temperature.          Mr. Dalton, on the contrary,
supposed that the increase of the volume is for each equal varia
tion of temperature, a constant portion of the volume at the
 foregoing temperature.       In truth, Mr. Dalton does not appear to
 have made direct experiments on this head : the only arguments
which he advances in favour of his hypothesis are reduced to the
 extreme simplicity under which laws in appearance verv complex
will then be presented, such as the law of the cooling of bodies,
 and that of the variation of the elastic force of steam.
    We ascertained, however, that the first of those laws will by
no means assume a character so simple as he pretends, even ad
mitting his hypothesis to be correct.
    To conclude: It is not by considerations of this kind that we
 can establish laws which observation alone ought to furnish.
 The experiments which we have made at high temperatures
 completely destroy the hypothesis of the English experimentalist :
for, so far from these experiments pointing out any thing per
 fectly positive as to the measurement of temperatures, it is at
least very probable that the march of the mercurial thermometer
ought to be more rapid than that of the temperatures, since in
all the other liquids the dilatability increases in proportion as
 they are heated ; whereas in the hypothesis which we are at
tacking, we shall find, on the contrary, that the dilatability of the
 mercury decreases rapidly in proportion as it is heated; a re
sult completely opposite to the very principles on which Mr.
Dalton had founded his theory of the measurement of tempera
tures.                        [To be continued.]

    Dr. Spurzheim has been for      a long time preparing  for publi
 cation a work on Insanity with the following title,  " Pathology  of
  Animal Life, or the Manifestations of the Human Mind in the
  State of Disease termed Insanity." Every person who is acquaint
 ed with the very distressing conditions of persons afflicted with
 diseases of the mind, but particularly the insane poor who are
 confined for the security of society in the melancholy cells of a
 madhouse, must be glad to hear that any new light is about to be
 thrown on this hitherto very obscure and incurable disorder. The
 public attention, too, has been particularly drawn towards this
 subject of late, by the very intimate scrutiny made into public
 lunatic asylums by persons invested with authority, before a com
 mittee of the house of commons: — an investigation rendered ab
 solutely necessary by the shamefully neglected state of insane per
 sons, and the general ignorance of the causes and cure of the
 disease itself ; — an investigation,  too, which has left the public
 mind in a state of alarm for the treatment of their unfortunate
 fellow-creatures.   Dr. Spurzheim, who has devoted many years of
 his life, and has exercised the most powerful talents, in pursuing
 this disease through all its stages and varieties, and who has
 spared neither time nor expense in visiting the principal asylums
 for the insane in Europe, has at length determined to lay his la
 bours before the public, with the hope that, since such a consider
able progress in the knowledge of the physiology of the brain and
the manifestations of the mind in a healthy state has of late been
made, a great deal may yet be done for those who suffer from its
partial or general derangement, by a philosophical comparison of
a very numerous collection of cases, with the peculiar organiza
tion and moral habits of the individuals.      The work will be pub
lished in the course of a few months.
    Several copies have recently been imported from Germany of
that immense work on Meteorology, the Ephernerides Societatis
PalafincB Meteorological , which contains abundant matter for
the meteorological speculators, who have become so numerous of
late in our country, to exercise their ingenuity on. It is remark
able that a work which contains so much information on a branch
of philosophy now so very popular, should be so little known in
Great Britain.

of the indisposision of the President, who has so long given it'
life and vigour.      A paper by Sir Everard Home (who was in the
chair)    was   read, relative to the comparative anatomy of the
Lumbricus marinus and Lumbricus terrestris, and comparing
their structure and habits with the Teredo navalis.          All these
worms have red blood ; all burrow in wood or clay ; all have
 muscular stomachs, and their blood is aerated by tubes in their
 backs.     The Lumbricus marinus has a small and scarcely per
 ceptible organ, which Sir E. considers to be a heart, near the centre
 of its body, where the arteries from the head unite, and where
 the veins separate to supply the extremities.      The author had in
 vain endeavoured to trace their organs or describe their bron-
 chise, til! aided by Mr. Cliff, who macerated the seaworm in
 vinegar; this coagulated its blood, and enabled him to make
 correct drawings of all its parts, and thereby ascertain the exact
 point where the arteries and veins ramified. The common earth
 worm has an artery along its belly and a vein along its back; in
 the latter are apertures to imbibe air.
      Nov. 14.     Dr. Johnson, by the hands of the President, fur
  nished a paper On the Structure and Natural History of the
  Leech of Rivulets, which he calls Hirudo vulgaris, instead of
  Hirudo oc/oculata of Linnaeus: his reason for adopting this name
  is the circumstance that the Hirudo tessulala has also eight
  eyes.    The Hirudo vulgaris he describes as living under stones
  in rivulets, being from one inch to one inch and a half, is of a
  blackish brown on its upper side with spots and greenish under
  neath.     It has no heart, but pulsates eight times in a minute.
  Dr. J. thinks that the whole of the leech genus are oviparous.
  This species copulates like snails,, is oviparous, and the ova are
   quick in three weeks, and break the kind of capsule in which
   they are enveloped in about two months.       It deposits from six
   to twenty or thirty ova, which are frequently destroyed by other
   leeches.    The author detailed minutely the appearances which
   this leech affords in its various stages from the ovum till it is
   full grown.
       Nov. 21.    A paper by Dr. Philip Wilson, of Worcester, was
   read, relating some further experiments and observations on the
   effects of Galvanism in curing asthma.       He stated that spas
   modic asthma is a disease of very rare occurrence, and that Gal
   vanism is of no advantage to it ; but that in nervous asthma in
                                                                    only

   only on« case in ten did it fail to give relief, and in most cases it
  was permanent.         In galvanizing patients it was from five to ten
  minutes before they found their breathing relieved.        He still used
  plates of onlv four inches square ; began with only a few, and some
  times extended them to thirty.         The conducting wires were ap
  plied to  pieces  of tinfoil placed on the nape of the neck and at the
  pit of the stomach, or rather lower, and he recommended the
  points of the wires Jo be moved a little on the tinfoil.      He found
  that all patients could bear a greater power at first, than after
  they had been galvanized several times.            Dr. W. assigned no
  reason for this fact; but it is evidently owing to the galvanic
 fluid blistering the skin on those parts, and thereby increasing
  their conducting powers, and at the same time augmenting their
 sensibility.     In some habits it produces inflammation, and ulcers
  which continue open several weeks.
                   BELFAST ACADEMICAL        INSTITUTION.
     Tuesday,    the   22(1  of October,   an election for a Professor  of
 Natural Philosophy came on in this Institution, when a number
 of gentlemen of high respectability and attainments offered
 themselves for the appointment.           The candidates had all pro
 duced so many honourable documents testifying their qualifica
 tions for the office, that it became difficult to point out the gen
 tleman most capable of the appointment. After full deliberation,
 the electors proceeded to the ballot, when Mr. Knight of Aber
 deen was found to have the greater part of the votes ; and we
 have no doubt, from what we have heard, that he will do honour
 to himself and to the Institution which has chosen him to the
 important charge.

The      average work performed by thirty engines in the month of
 October was, according to Messrs. Leans' Report, 20,920,267
pounds of water lifted one fooc high with each bushel of coals
 consumed.
     Woolf's engine at Wheal Vor during the same month lifted
39,556,496 pounds; and the one at Wheal Abraham 50,69S, 188
pounds, with a load of 15*1 per square inch in cylinder, with
each bushel.         His other engine at the latter mine lifted
30,672,254 pounds with each bushel — her load 3-1 per inch in
cylinder.
     The engine at Wheal Chance, alluded to in our last, is reported
to have lifted 44,615,811 pounds with each bushel, loaded 13-4

     Sir, — Referring to the note at the end of Mrs. Ibbetson's
 paper in your last number, I beg leave to observe that, not having
immediate access to the work referred to in her preceding com
munication, I pointed out the error in the reduction of the de
gree of heat shown by the plant in Mons. Hubert's experiment,
page 184, under the impression that Reaumur's thermometer
was correctly quoted.
   It now appearing that the circumstance is detailed with re*
ference to Celsius's thermometer, it must be obvious that instead
of making " the assertion respecting the heat the more impossi
                                                                     it by
ble to be believed," it tends to strengthen                    it,
                                                      reducing the
extent of the variation     at the same time that
                                    :                 shows an in
crease of temperature very evident to the sense of feeling,                                  it
brings the phenomenon more within the limits of probability.
   In both Reaumur and Celsius's thermometers the zero fixed                       is
at the freezing point of water, the range between that and boil
ing being 80' in the former, and 100° in the latter.
   In my last* pointed out that, according to the quotation in
                       I

3S6                          Mints of Saxony.
                             MINES OF SAXONY.
       M.de Bonnard, engineer of the French mines, has recently pub*
 lished in French a " Geognostic Essay on the Erzegebirge, or the
 Metalliferous Mountains of Saxony." The author has substituted
 the word geognosy, which is used by the Germans for that of geo
 logy, employed hitherto by the French, because he thinks it bet
  ter adapted to express the science which is confined to the de
 scription of the nature and the peculiar arrangement of soils.
       The country which M. de Bonnard has examined, comprises
  not only that part of the Saxon territory designated by the name
  of the circle of the Erzegebirge, but also a portion of the circle
  of Misnia, in the environs of Dresden, as well as the high moun
  tains which separate Saxony from Bohemia, and some points of
  the latter kingdom, on the southern slope of the ridge.          " It is
  one of the most interesting countries," M. de Bonnard observes,
  " of all those which a traveller can visit under a geognostic point
  of view ; it contains within a very limited space a great quantity
  of different soils ; the numerous mining concerns in full activity
   facilitate our observation : lastly, it is the constant theme of mi
  neralogists, who visit it to learn from M. Werner himself the art
   of observing nature."
        M. de Bonnard passed    several months in Erzegebirge, and per
   sonally explored its stratification in company with some of the
   most distinguished mineralogists of the continent.        He refers the
   whole constitution or arrangement of the Erzegebirge to three
   principal groups, each having a particular centre, and composed
   of rocks the arrangement of which has no connexion with that of
   the other groups, at least as to the primitive soils which consti
   tute them essentially.
        The first, which he calls group or system of the east, seems to
   be composed of rocks grouped around a nucleus of granite, si
    tuated near and to the eastward of Freyberg.
        The second, which he calls system of the south-west, is com
   posed of rocks one part of which is visibly supported on the gra-
    iiite of the north of Bohemia and the south-west of the Erzege
              -     :
    birge.
        The third, to which he gives" the name of group of the north
    west, is formed almost entirely of eurite (weigslein), which seems
    grouped around a hidden nucleus situated between the Zschop-
     pau and the Mulda.
        Between these groups of ancient soils we meet with more re-
     ce.nt formations, which cover the slopes of the former and fill the
     intervals which separate them.        M. de Bonnard describes sepa
     rately  those three systems  of stratification, by examining for each
     of them successively the different kinds of soil which compose
                                                   .
                                                .'                   them.

                          Mines of Saxony.                       387
them.     He considers in the examination of each soil, 1st, the
nature of the principal rock, and the interesting geognostic facts
which it presents ; 2d, the subordinate banks which this rock
contains; 3d, the veins (filons) which pass through it.
    M. de Bonnard's arrangement confines him to the indications
presented by the external form of the ground ; and it has the ad
vantage of presenting groups very clearly limited, and which dif
fer from each other, either by the system of rock which is predo
minant, by the general inclination of these rocks, or by the nature
of the nucleus around which they are grouped.       Speaking of the
anomalies which he had observed in the system or group of the
east, M. de Bonnard thus expresses himself: " I ought to men
tion that the inclinations indicated are not without exception.
Some anomalies are presented, for example, in the environs of Dip-
poldswalde, Glasshute, &c. ; others take place even in the vicinity
of the granitic nucleus. The inclinations which are remarked in
these places, different from those presented as general, may be
long to some prolongation or hidden branch of the nucleus, or to
other causes which are unknown to us : but it appears to me that
they cannot shake the results drawn from the general observation
of the observed arrangement of the soil."
    M. de Bonnard speaks highly of M. Daubuisson's work on the
mines of Freyberg, all now at work : they are upwards of 150 in
number, and occupy 5000 workmen, producing annually 50,000
marcs of silver, a quantity of lead varying from 3000 to 10,000
quintals, and rarely more than from 100 to 200 quintals of cop
per. He also mentions, as a new and remarkable undertaking, the
navigable and subterraneous canal called Friederick-bemw-stolln.
They have been obliged to dig this canal from Dorrenthal to
Pfappenrode, a length of 1 1 00 toises, to find the waters of a river
 (the Biela) in order to unite them with those which give motion
to the machinery of Freyberg.      It is intended to open another,
also subterraneous, of 1600 toises, with the same view.        Much
 more time will be requisite to finish these useful works ; but they
will give the possibility of working the existing mines of Frey
berg to more advantage, and of re-opening others which have been
 abandoned for want of the means of clearing them of water.
    The principal shaft of the mines of Altenburg has been made
by blasting in- the stanniferous rock.    The working always took
place bv blasting, by means of huge excavations, which were en
larged without any precaution, until in 1620 there was a general
 falling in of all the workings. This disaster produced an excava
 tion of nearly 600 feet diameter by 300 feet in depth. They have
 continued to work by blasting in the parts which remained solid,
 and they have not given up the plan of chambers of large dimen
 sions.    These are dug in the parts most abounding in tin ; those
                                    B b 2                      which

SS8                            Gas   Lights.
which are nearly on      a level are connected by galleries, and form
stages    to the number of six, which go to a depth of 140 fathoms.
In old times they seem to have gone 35 toises lower. There ex
ists an excavation which is 60 fathoms deep, and from 20 to 40
in breadth.      M. de Bonnard regards these works as the most
astonishing    for their boldness which exist in any mine, but as by
far too large, and therefore inconvenient.
    M. de Bonnard terminates what he has said on the subject of
the granite of his second system, with a few words on the hot
springs of Carlsbad, a town situated on the Tceppel in a narrow
valley shut in by two granite mountains, and which he conceives
to be very extraordinarv.        In the valley there is no other species
of rock, and it is from this basin that a spring of boiling water
issues from under a calcareous arch which it has formed itself by
its depositions, and under which is an excavation full of vapour
and water, the depth of which is unknown.           In order to account
for this fact, M. Werner thinks that there is at the bottom of the
valley, under the stratum of vegetable earth, coal in a state of
combustion, which expands the water from the Tceppel, which
filters through subterranean cavities.       The waters of Carlsbad are
 the most frequented of Germany and Europe.               They contain
sulphate and muriate of soda, lime, carbonic acid, and iron : the
 sulphate of soda is the most abundant, and is extracted on the
spot.
    M.   de  Bonnard informs    us that " in the mines of Joachimstadt
 there was found, at the depth of 1.50 toises, a large trunk of a
 bituminized tree, with the vestiges of bark, branches, and leaves.
 It has been entirely carried off piecemeal for mineralogical cabi
 nets, and numerous specimens have been sold under the name of
 'wood of the deluge.'"
     In a very copious recapitulation he generalizes the observations
 made in the course of his paper, and pursues every separate rock
 through all the circumstances of stratification under which it has
 been presented to him.
                               GAS LIGHTS.
    The advantages resulting from the application of gas to the
lighting of streets and houses have been recently extended to the
 Surrey sideof theThames: aud thewholeofthe Borough ofSoutk-
wark, with that part of Blackfriars Road between the bridge and
the Rev. Mr. Hill's chapel, is now brilliantly illuminated in
this'ceconomical and efficient manner.         In addition to the Surrey
Institution, nearly all the shops in that district, and the elegant
private residence of Mr. Potts in the Clink liberty, are lighted with
gas, which is found fully to answer every purpose of domestic
ceconomy. The superb dining- and drawing-rooms, with the li

         Preparation of Borium.- — Herculanean Manuscripts.        389
   bvary and billiard-room of this splendid mansion in particular,
  exhibit a most pleasing and brilliant scene when thus lighted ;
   and Mr. Potts has added to the general effect by the introduc
   tion of an efficient system of ventilation, thus precluding all pos
  sibility of any disagreeable effect.        The establishment from
  which the gas is supplied is situated at Bankside, and is under
   the direction of Messrs. Monro and Co. The premises are the
   most roomy that have been hitherto fitted up as a gas-light ma
   nufactory, and the whole arrangements of furnaces, retorts, and
  gasometers have been made upon the most correct and scientific
  principles.    The utmost regularity is preserved in the various
  departments of the works, and not the slightest accident has oc
  curred since their erection.
                        PREPARATION    OF BORIUM.
      M. Dobereiner     has published  a new process for extracting
  borium from borax. — After melting the borax and reducing it
  to a fine powder, one-tenth of its weight of lampblack is added;
  this mixture is put into a gunbarrel, one end of which is closed,
  and to the other is affixed a tube for receiving the gas, and tlie
  gunbarrel is then kept at a white heat during two hours.      Much
  of the gaseous oxide of carbon is disengaged ; and when the
  process is finished, there remains in the tube a compact mass of
   a blackish-gray colour, which is reduced to powder, and which,
  after being washed several times with boiliug water and once
  with hydrochloric, acid, yields a pulverulent greenish-black sub
  stance similar to borium, except that it is still mixed with a lit
  tle charcoal.     M. Dobereiner thinks that the charcoal begins
  by reducing the soda, and that afterwards it is the sodium which
i
  tlecomposes the boracic acid : consequently, he concludes that
  a greater quantity of borium might be obtained, if to the borax
  half its weight of soda or of potash were added, and a quantity
  of charcoal double of that which is here mentioned.

      Messrs. Tvrwhitt and Hayter having been employed to unrol,
  if possible, the Herculaneum MSS. belonging to the Institute
  of France, by means of a new process, the Institute has appointed

  Rochette, to superintend and assist in the operation.

                              HYDROPHOBIA.
      A Dublin practitioner states, that he has seen the symptoms
   of hydrophobia checked by the application of a tourniquet.              A
  girl was bitten in the foot, and hydrophobia supervened ; Dr.
  Stokes applied atourniquet to her thigh, and the symptoms instant
  ly subsided. His intention was to amputate the limb, but it was
  opposed by other medical attendants.           One of this physician's
  pupils considers hydrophobia, like trismus, to be a spasmodic
  disease, which may be cured by the judicious application of tur
  pentine with other antispasmodics.           The effect of the tour
  niquet seems to favour the plan of bleeding ad deliquium,
       ARRIVAL OF SOME NON-DESCR1PT ANIMALS IN LONDON.
      Four new and nondescript animals are now exhibiting in the
  King's Mews Riding-House: they seem to be an extraordinary
  species of deer, lately arrived from North America.          The follow
  ing is a sketch of their natural history.
      As these new quadrupeds are natives of North America, which
  has now been discovered for more than three centuries past, it
  must necessarily excite wonder, that neither the horns nor the
  skin of such a fine animal, nor its description, have ever beforo
                                                                    reached

reached Europe, notwithstanding that America was discovered
and settled, and is now occupied, by the descendants of Europeans.
   The persons who have charge of these animals state, that a
German naturalist, who had been employed several years in ex
ploring that part of Louisiana, called the Upper Missouri coun
try, brought them from thence over-land to Baltimore, where, as
well as at Philadelphia and New York, they were exhibited for
money.
  They are in their nature very timid, and at the same time of
such power and activity when grown, that it is not possible fb
take them out of the forest alive ; but some remote tribes of In
dians having discovered that they were susceptible of domestica
tion, and of being trained to draw their sledges in winter over the
snow and ice, took them when fawns in nets, and brought them
up in their houses with great care and kindness, thus depriving
them of their wild habits, and making them at last of great value
and importance for their services in harness.
    Their flesh in the winter season is so juicy and nutritive that it
is sought after with avidity by the White hunters as well as the
Indians; in consequence of which, the species is threatened with
an early and total destruction.
    This animal is naturally inclined to be domestic.       In his na
tive abode he has his peculiar family or fraternity; each family
has its own peculiar range of pasture, and does not intrude into
that of its neighbours; he is not a rambler: and this family at
tachment is so strong, the hunters know that if they can knock
down but one of them they can make sure of the rest at pleasure.
    The name of this animal, in the language of the aborigines,
is Wapiti, which has been adopted by Professor Mitchill, of the
university of New York, and by the late Dr. Barton, of Phila
delphia; but some naturalists have mistaken his character, and
called him the Elk or Moose, which is an animal with broad pal-
mated horns, and an uncouth figure, whereas the horn of the
wapiti i6 round, and his figure elegant.
    The age of the male of this species is ascertained by its horn
till it is full grown; he sheds them annually: the females have
 no horns.
    The colour of these animals   is,   in the winter, on the body, of
a. peculiar dunnish hue; the neck and legs are   a    dark brown, the
rump  is   a   pale yellowish white; the colour- extending about six
or seven inches from the tail on all sides, and very distinct from
the general colour of the body.         A  black semi-circular line of
unequal width (from    a     quarter -of an inch to two inches) sepa
rates the white of the rump on either buttock, from the dun of
the body.
    The bead resembles that of the eoramon American deer (Cervus

Virginianus) and of the horse, much more than that of the elk
or moose, and is pointed and handsome.         The legs are admirably
formed     for strength  and activity, resembling those of the race
horse, particularly the hinder ; on the outside of each of these is
a protuberance of yellowish hair, which is the seat of a gland that
secretes an unctuous substance, and the animal applies it to
smooth and dress his coat, which is so admirably constructed that
it is thus rendered impervious to rain, or to water if he swims
across a river.
     The wapiti has an oblique slit or opening under the inner an
gle of each eye, nearly an inch long externally, which appears to
 be an auxiliary to the nostril.     He has no voice like the horse or
 the ox, and this organ seems to be given him as a compensation;
 for with it he makes a noise, which he can vary at pleasure, and
 which is like the loud and piercing whistle that boys give by
 putting their fingers in their mouth.
     The anatomist and naturalist will find in the structure of this
 animal a variety of objects highly deserving their best attention.
      Notwithstanding the wapiti has a cloven foot and chews the
  cud like the ox, yet he has a bridle tusk like the horse, and the
 lower jaw is admirably fitted to be operated upon by a bridle and
 bit. The tongue is remarkable for its softness and smoothness.
      The wapiti is esteemed, and justly, the pride of the American
 forest, being unquestionably the handsomest and most valuable
  native quadruped that has yet been discovered in that extensive
  country.     He is mature when he is twelve years old, and his full
  size is about eighteen hands.      The largest of the two males now
  iii the King's Mews is full fourteen hands, and that he has but
  lately entered his sixth year is manifest from his horns.
      Like all other animals that are long in coming to maturity,
  they live to a great age; the full extent of their lives is indeed not
  perfectly known; but the Indians (who keep no registers) say of
  a man, when he is grown in years and inactive, that " he is as
  old as a ,wapiti," which certainly indicates that this animal must
   at least equal the age of him to whom he is compared.
      The two females appear to be smaller and somewhat younger
  than the males; their necks resemble in some degree that of the
   dromedary.
      The food of the wapiti, in a domestic state, is the same as that
   of the cow or the horse; and they are,if properly managed, equally
   tractable. Ill usage or harshness makes them alarmed and impa
   tient; but they are very sensible of benefits, and lick the hand that
   feeds them.
      No quadruped can he more personally clean than the wapiti;
   his breath is as sweet as that of the cow.    The males are attached
   to only one female, and the latter generally produce twins.
                                                                     The

                   Alternating Colours of Stars.                    393
    The Upper Missouri country is in the same latitude as England;
its winters are a little more rigorous and its summers somewhat
warmer; and it abounds in rich pastures of white trefoil, which
the hunters call Buffalo grass.
    From what has been stated, we find that these animals were ex
hibited as curiosities even in the principal American. cities, con
sequently they must be unknown in all the cultivated and settled
parts of the United States.
                  ALTERNATING      COLOURS   OF STARS.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
   Sir, — I have     lately made an observation on the rapid mu
tation of  the colour of the light of some of the fixed stars, which
I think worth noticing in your Magazine, in order principally to
induce other persons to be attentive to the circumstance.           The
first observation of this kind 1 made was in the month of Sep
tember, in a warm evening.          In a star of the first magnitude I
noticed a rapid alternation in the colour of the light. 'The change
was from the ordinary colour to a deep red, and then back again
to the common colour of the star.         From repeated observations
I found the red colour to last about two seconds, and the or
dinary colour about three seconds.
    That peculiar apparent motion in the light, commonly called
twinkling, was very -strong at the time.          I observed this phse-
nomenon during the space of above fifteen minutes, when a cloud
obscuring the sky I could no longer see it.         I attributed this to
the refraction produced by some terrestrial vapour which might
be rising up in undulatory or intercepted layers, and had no idea
at the time of the possibility that it might depend on the man
ner of the transmission of light from the star, till I noticed it
again this month in the a. Orionis, when the reddish colour again
alternated with the yellowish, and the alternation was more rapid
and corresponded to the twinkling.
    I have merely noticed this circumstance here in a hasty and'
cursory manner, to excite others to observe, as I have always no
ticed it in autumn.      But I hope shortly to lay before the public
more accurate minutes of observations on this phsenomenon.
Without offering any further comment on its possible cause at
present, I am, in haste, yours, &c.
   Clapton, Oct. 16, 1816.                         THOMAS FoRSTER.
    P. S. — If any corresponding observations have been made in
distant countries, I shall be obliged by their communication
through your Magazine.          I hope, with your permission, in a
future number to give minutes of some of my observations which
I have not by me at present.
                                                                 TBLLV.

394                 Tellurium.   — Ruins of Velleia.
                                TErXURIUM.
   The following description of a new ore of tellurium, by Pro
fessor Estnark of Chri&tiania, appears in the third volume of the
Transactions of the Geological Society of London : —
   It   occurs coarsely disseminated, and crystallized in perfect
hexagonal pjates striped on the edges.
   It has the whitish hue of tin.
   Its fracture displays a perfect foliation, but only in one direction.
   It has a strong metallic lustre ; a moderate flexibility; con
siderable softness, and feels heavy.
   Before the blowpipe it burns with the colour and smell of tel
lurium, and has the same action with acids.           The precipitate by
water burns upon charcoal like tellurium ; but after its sublima
tion a small metallic button remained of the colour of silver,
malleable, but too minute for further examination ; for on ac
count of the rarity of the substance I could only devote a single
grain to this examination.
    It is found in the Orndal copper mine, accompanied by cop
per pyrites, and a small intermixture of sulphuret of molybdenum.
The mine is called Mosnap, and has been full of water for several
years.     The vein lies in mica slate.       I met with the same ore in
Hungary,     in the  collection  of my   friend  M. Gerhard, who gave
me a specimen       of it ;  but as he  did  not know  from what part of
Hungary it came, he did not value it. For this reason I omitted
taking notice of it in the journal of my travels through Hungary
and the Bannat of Temeswar.
    It is easily distinguished from molybdenum, by its colour and
its habitude before the blowpipe.
                            RUINS OF VELfcEIA.
                                                     Parma, October 13.
   Two Englishmen have         been here some time, and have investi-    '
gated with great attention our monuments of the arts, our
museums, and our libraries ; they visited the ruins of Velleia, and
in assisting at the works discovered an elegant bas-relief which
was placed over a fountain.            It represents the two. brothers
Castor and Pollux.        This bas-relief, which the celebrated anti
quary M. De Lama, who is appointed to superintend the extri
cation of the ruins, believes to be Grecian, is in the best taste.
It consists of four figures, and the attitude of Castor is admirable,
having all the grace of the antique.         These scientific Englishmen
have had several conversations with Abbe Derossi, one of the
most learned men in the Oriental languages, and who possesses
an unique collection of bibles.      The Emperor Alexander evinced
his willingness to possess this valuable library; but it appears
that Austria wishes this literary monument to remain in Italy.
M. Derossi has refused the offers of those Englishmen, who
wished to treat with him for his biblical library.

    LXXXI.       On the Physiology         of Vegetables.         By Mrs.
                              Agnes Ibbetson.
                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    How       exquisite is tit is formation!      how perfect this
scheme of plants ! — Each day adds to the beauty of the system, to
the exquisite development of the vegetable, and renders the plan
still more perfect, more impossible to be confuted, as every part
exactly coincides.
    In my last letter I showed that I was completely justified re
specting all I had written concerning the flowers and leaves form
ing in the root; and mentioned that Sir Wm. Herschel had done
me the honour to inspect and examine the specimens, and give
his assent to this (by far the most difficult part of the plan):
I then proved that the apparent flower consisted only of the
pistil and corolla, and that a specimen having these, if thrown
on a glass, would (from the line of life being cut) eject moisture
sufficient to continue the vegetable growth of the flowers as
long as the juices remained; and that I had known them con
tinue in moisture sufficient, for nearly a whole week.
    But I have now an additional fact of extreme importance to
communicate to the public, which most admirably continues,
nay, finishes the foundation of the growth of plants, in a manner
so complete, and with a simplicity so exquisite,             as at once to
declare the plan of its origin to proceed from God alone, for no
human sagacity could have devised or suggested it.                Before I
began my promised dissection of the buds, it occurred to me
(being the usual season in which to do             to examine the seeds,
                                                   it)
and see whether they could at all contribute to the showing the
flowers.     ButI    had so carefully dissected them before, that               I
despaired :    but there  is  certainly    aprogressive line in my dis
coveries over which   I   have no power.       Words will not do justice
to my astonishment at finding that all the interior of the seed
 (surrounding the embryo)          filled up either
                                   is                        by
                                                          bladders, which
each contain  a   separate germ    tied  together  with  an extremely fine
line of life, or branches of very diminutive size running all over
the interior of the seed, the embryo excepted. See fig.               Plate
                                                                      1.

 conjecture, whether I should not find also a germ in the heart
 of  each seed while in the root, and mounting the alburnum ves
 sel ? since it must probably be in the former the seed would first
 take its shoot.    But fancying that this must be a very difficult
 matter to see, from its extreme minuteness, I prepared my solar
 microscope with all its powers, and picked out the most oily of
 the firs, as well as a specimen of the largest heart of the seed: —
 the first in the Firms rubra, the seeds of which are remarkably
 clear and full of bark juice ; the second in the Cactus, which
seed has an excessive large heart: and choosing a very sunny day,
 I at length discovered the germ, not only in the heart of the fir-
seed while in the root, and in the alburnum ; but more obscurely
in the Cactus.      The former, indeed, was very plain in six se
parate   hearts,  which   I placed in one field of view. I perceived
not only   the germ   to each, but the same species of root, or jelly
 like matter, before found attached to the beginning sprout of
 the sea-weed, and imitated in the buckwheat, (fig. 3,) whichap-
 pears also in the heart of the fir, (fig. 5.)
     The regular process, therefore, seems to be — that the heart of
the seed mounts with its germ from the root, where it takes it
in, into the seed-vessel, and proves itself to be the seed not only
by my being able to trace it through its whole progress to fructi
fication, but by having the same germ in the heart it afterwards
displays spreading from the primordial branch all around the
embryo, after the seed is fructified : and thus, when the seed is
fit to place in the ground, it is not only the embryo that is pre
pared to throw up its shoot, but the female flower is also fitted
for its increase, and fixes, by means of the various germs in the
seed, the beginning stripe for each line in the wood, (which I
showed in my last letter,) and serves as a commencement also
of flower the next year, in each flower-bud. The flower there
fore, that is the cor and pericarp, is continued from plant to
plant, while the male is renewed and reproduced yearly in
every tree.    This accounts for the bark and pollen in a graft
never joining, while every other part is strictly assimilated. This
proves also that I was right in saying that the stripes of flowers
in the wood were formed not the year they appear at the ex
terior of the plant, but the preceding: indeed the appearance of
the two is so dissimilar not only in form and size, but in situa
tion also, that it is impossible to take them for each other; the
first being simply in stripes, but those which are to open the
present year, both in trees and herbaceous plants, are discovered
not only larger, but in all sorts of festoons, wreaths, and bou
quets, making the richest and most beautiful patterns.
    Thus I may be now said to have brought the history of the
                                                          foundation

     foundation of vegetable life to some degree of regularity and per
     fection.    The ^germ which surrounds the embryo cannot grow
    till after fructification, because the surrounding part of the heart
     does not grow or increase till then ; but there appears a little
     germ round the vacancy in the heart below the branch from
    which it seems to shoot : these germs always remain white, which
    is probablv the cause of their not being before noticed; for there
    is such a confusion of richness (if I may so call              as to render              it)              it
    extremely difficult at first to distinguish or discriminate each se
    parate ingredient; and have several times,   1           drawing the root of        in

    flowers, leaves, branches, and seeds             quantities          in
                                                                    and though                ;               I

    glasses, that they even now far exceed those of a young person.
        I  shall now give       sketch of the whole process, that

    in so new       case, can hardly be avoided, without danger of mis

     distinguished.     BB, where the powder forms into balls, still cor
      loured.    CC, where the female or flower first enters the radicle
  .  from the root and old seed, and breaking off into shoots or sepa
      rate germs they are drawn within the seeds.           DD, apart where
     the pollen appears to he collected.          The ball when first formed
     at AA, then consists of the heart of the seed only, composed of
     an empty bladder, and a shoot below it ; the vacuum is the
     part of the corculum which is first filled up, when the heart is
     fructified, and brought from the root; and the shoot is certainly,
     tile origin of the primordial branch, which reaches down from,
     under the layers which form the embryo, and which when the
     embryo is completed runs under, to spread all over the interior
     surrounding part.       When the seed is once fixed in the earth, it
     serves as a basis for the stripes of flowers in the wood, and as a,
     commencement of those which entered the radicle*.                But when,
     the new-formed seeds are thus finished, they rise from the root,
     pass through the alburnum ; it is then the flowers of the pre
     ceding year that enter the flower-bud.             It is the festoons and
     bouquets that are alone forward enough to complete them
     selves, and rise up by the simple growth of their several pedun
     cles, and burst into light and beauty.         No tree, therefore, could
     flower the first year ; and in annual and herbaceous plants, sea
     sons must stand in lieu of years.        It is by means of the com
    parison of one part of the formation of plants we must
    judge of another.        This is curiously exemplified in another case,
    as in the cabbage and many vegetables, whose yearly row of
    wood (instead of increasing each year) forms a new specimen
    each season.      This may be the same with the stripes and bou
     quets. Besides, in quicker-growing plants I much doubt whether
    this arrangement is not wholly managed by climate : at any
    rate the female flower as well as the line of life is the prolonga
    tion of vital power ; and the quantity of matter I have seen
    flow into the seeds at the time of the corolla passing off, and
    which I have often mentioned with astonishment, is now most
    admirably accounted for, as most probably forming the innume
    rable new shoots of flowers in each separate bladder, surrounding
    the embryo of the seeds jnst fructified.            Vegetables as well as
    animal bodies can convert the juices of the atmosphere into
    their own substance, and thus augment the number of their
    component particles.         This operation is certainly as constant as
        * This indeed
                      may be another reason why the seed is so long attached
\   to the embryo and growing plant, not being severed by Nature till the
    germ has fixed its stripes in the wood of the now tree, and till the flowers
    have descended into the new radicles to enter the new-made seeds. — What
    exquisite contrivance'!, what admirable invention !
                                                                             the

                 On the Physiology of Vegetables.                   405
the exertion of that force by which they resist putrescence ; for
the absorption of atmospheric matter, its conversion into nutri
tive fluid, and the transmission of those juices of the body, is in
vegetables effected by a constant absorption of the external sur
face.     And in. plants which increase indefinitely (for though I
 have been able to trace the stoppage of the yearly rows of wood,
yet I never have seen the yearly shoot miss), they do not, like
the animal body, lose on one side what thev gain on the other.
 Still the internal parts change their condition : it is true the old
and useless paits are thrown out, as I have shown in the new
formed bark and wood ; but the quantity of wood is still renewed
in the new shoot each season, and the extension of the tree ii
increased, and increases in this way as h ug as life endure? ;
 though in extreme old age it generally loses, by wind and ac
cidents, on the north and east sides what it gains by new shoots
in the south and west.
    However feeble and minute the parts of an embryo may be,
we can certainly, in vegetables, trace it nearer the beginning of
life than in animals: still it has its origin in the parent tree;,
still it takes its line of life and female flower from the original
seed, and from them receives its, vital impulse; both have parti
cipated in the existence of other living beings, and exercised
the functions themselves.        Thus then the line of life and the fe
male germ are the parts which more particularly support and
convey life in the vegetable, and continue invariably from plant
to plant; and, like all organized beings, are produced bv genera
tion, grow by nutrition, and are destroyed by decomposition.
    I have noticed that at fig. 6, DD had the appearance of
pollen between the seeds, being exactly like that which shows
itself in the alburnum.       There is still something obscure in the
first growth of this powder, as I have never yet been able to say
  I
" saw it grow" as I have certainly and most trulv done the ~
seeds and-flowers.       Therefore there is something more to be dis
covered in this part: all that shows it parsing into the seed-
vessel and into the stamen, is as complete as investigation can,
make it ; but its first forming is defective : it is in the first shoot
ing of the germ of a tree from its seed this must be sought,
and probably its beginning may be traced in one of the inner'
folds of the radicle, both in the tap root and side roots.        It will
appear uncommonly stupid that, taking up a fresh tree every
week or less, for four years together, I should not hr.ve traced
all it contains.     But I know not how it      is,
                                                  I    never can attend
to more than one subject at a time; and then all that may ap

object of my studv, and enables me to investigate more deeply.
It certainly, however, makes my progress slower :— but I have
been rather accused of doing too much, than too little; though
I do not know how that can be the case, unless 1 have done
carelessly and ill what I perform or discover.
     Perhaps the next thing necessary to the obtaining a thorough
knowledge of the formation of plants, and to comprehend their
real physical nature, is to establish as exact an idea of the situa
tion they hold in the animal and in the inanimate world as
possible. I have already done this in some measure ; but I still
think a much more discriminating picture may be presented, — '
that by drawing the limits that in vegetables cannot be passed,
and by fixing the boundary lines of such a being as a vegetable
really    is, will at once coirect all those false ideas we are per
 petually introducing, though so foreign to its very nature.
      For example As      : plant has no brain, no nerves, or spine, nei

 can therefore have no sensation, no feeling, for sensation and vo-t
 luntary motion coincide         nor, when compared with inanimate
                                         ;

 chemical agent, altering its combinations.          .
    If   therefore a motion       perceived in
                                          is        vegetable,a     cannot be it
  attributed to its air or its juices, to which            but too commonly

 referred, without considering that such motion belongs not to
  its nature: but the cause must be sought in that which                    ana-,    is
  logons to its form, which agrees with and appertains to its life.

 and very nature of a vegetable.        No cold-blooded animal per
spires, and plants may be considered in this light : a being whose

 blood, and that for a very short time, rarely deviates from                            it,

perspiration necessary to cool and regulate the heat of the sy
stem.     The uses of perspiration are to free the blood from its
redundant water,— an operation vegetables certainly cannot re
quire, — and to expel from the body those particles which            re           by
peated circulation have become acrimonious. Now             have shown I
before that plants have no circulation, of course they require

 LXXXII.      On the Origin     of the Atomic Theory.     By William

                          [Concluded   from p. 371.]
 The     next subject which the Doctor introduces, after giving my
 theory to Dalton, relates to the doctrine of Volumes discovered as
he tells us by M. Gay Lussac, and published in the year 1809. He
 found "that they follow a very simple law in their combinations;
 that one volume of one gas always unites either with one volume
 of another gas, or with two volumes, or with three volumes."
 He then adduces a few examples to support this law.
    " Gay Lussac also showed that the diminution of volume which
 takes place on the combination of tiiese gases, follows as sim
 ple a law as the volumes in which they combine.             In nitrous
 gas the oxygen and azote undergo no condensation; accordingly
 the specific gravity of nitrous gas is the mean between that of
 oxygen and azote.        Frequently one of the two gases retains its
 bulk unaltered, while the other totally disappears."
    " This curious law discovered by Gay Lussac, when coupled
 with the doctrine of Mr. Dalton, shows us, that there exists a
 very simple relation between the weight of the atoms and the
 bulk of the gaseous bodies.            Accordingly, the weight of the
 atoms of these bodies may be deduced with sufficient accuracy
 from their specific gravity.        This method was employed both
 by Sir H. Davy and Dr. Wollaston."
    The theory of volumes of Gay Lussac was published after
 Dalton's Atomic Theory, therefore the latter could derive no
 advantage from it.        Now the doctrine of the proportions in
 which particles unite to particles, or atoms to atoms. could only
 be deduced from a previous knowledge of the specific gravity of
 simple gases and of their compounds in the gaseous state, and
 of the proportions in which they unite volume to volume.           The
 whole of my Atomic System was founded on those principles,
 and without this preliminary knowledge I could not advance a
                                                                  single

siiigle step. The Doctor acknowledges, in the number of his
Annals of Philosophy for December 1 S 1 3 , that I anticipated
Gay Lussac's theory of volumes : — What a boon! yet the Doctor
never mentioned my name in the whole history of the Atomic
Theory.       This last circumstance shows a personal and rooted
prejudice.       It manifests in the most decisive manner a deter
mined and wilful neglect, or rather suppression of previous la
bours.
      The specific gravities of the different gases, known when 1 first
wrote, were ascertained.         There were very few added to them
since.
      The proportions in which they were capable of uniting, in
volumes were also known.
      It was very well known that one volume of oxygen required
two volumes of hydrogen to constitute water ; and I had shown
that the one and two volumes contained the same number of
ultimate divisions, and that the difference of the specific gravity
of those gases depended on the size of their respective particle.-*,
making an allowance for the more expanded state of the hydro
gen gas.       From this statement the weight of the atom of water
was rendered very obvious.
      The proportion in which oxygen and sulphuretted hydrogen,
properly prepared, united in volumes, was also given.
      It was stated, that oxygen does not contract by union with
sulphur in any considerable degree, so as to produce sulphurous
acid gas, and that this gas is nearly double the weight of the
oxygen : hence it was inferred that an atom of sulphurous acid
consisted of one ultimate particle of oxygen, and an ultimate
particle of sulphur of the same weight.              The quantity of oxy
gen consumed in saturating the sulphuretted hydrogen, gave on
ihe above principles the relative number of the particles of hy
 drogen and sulphur in this compound gas.
      It was very well ascertained long since by many chemists, that
 the gaseous oxide of azote contains one volume of azote and
 half a volume of oxygen; and I have shown that the particles of
 azote in this gas are united to a single particle of oxygen; con
 sequently the half measure of oxygen contains as many division*
 as a full measure of azote : and as the difference of the specific
 gravity of these gases is very small, we may infer that an ultimate
 particle of azote is nearly twice as heavy as that of oxygen*.
     * The difference between the weights of an ultimate
                                                              particle of azote
 and oxygen    was stated by me for the first time in my Atomic Theory.
 Dr. Thomson says, in the article under our consideration, that others made*
 the same remark, without alludina to me. It might he the case; but have  I
 not been able to trace it out.   I shall always give full credit to the Doctor
 vi'lien he quotes the passage on what Sic asserts.
                                                                            This

  410             On the Origin    of the Atomic Theory.
     This gas is much more condensed than its constituent gases,
 and its specific gravity is in proportion to the degree of con
  densation.
     Nitrous gas, whose atoms contain one of azote and two of
  oxygen, is much lighter than gaseous oxide.           This struck me
 very mijch while writing my Comparative View, and in that
 work I attributed it to the size of the calorific atmospheres which
 surrounded its atoms.       This gas consists of equal volumes of its
 constituent gases.
     Nitrous gas and oxygen gas unite in the proportion of two
 of the former to one of the latter to form red nitrous acid, which
 contains one of azote and three of oxygen.            This proves that
 there are as many divisions or ultimate particles in the one volume
 of oxygen as there are atoms in the two volumes of nitrous gas.
 This gives the weight of an atom of nitrrous acid.
    When I wrote, I was well acquainted with the volumes in
 which carburetted hydrogen and oxygen united, viz. carburetted
 hydrogen 5'5 and oxygen 7'5; the quantity of this oxygen that
 was expended by the hydrogen of the gas was ascertained, and
 the remainder was found in the carbonic acid gas formed.          Cor
 rect deductions were drawn from this experiment, viz. that car
 bon unites to two portions of oxygen.          It was also ascertained
 that there were different kinds of carburetted hydrogen, and that
 they required different quantities of oxygen to saturate them *.
 The volumes in which azote and hydrogen united were ascer
tained by Dr. Austin and Berthollet, and the degree of their
 condensation were well known.
    The volumes in which ammoniacal gas and muriatic acid gas,
ammoniacal gas and sulphurous acid gas, ammoniacal gas and
 carbonic acid gas, unite so as to saturate each other, were well
known to me and to a few more in England, before I published
on the subject of chemistry.
    From the foregoing facts it is clear that there was nothing
new in Gay Lussac's important discovery of his theory of volumes,
as the Doctor is pleased to call it.        If he could give it to his
friend Dalton, he would not transfer it to a foreigner, — a fo
reigner no doubt of considerable celebrity in chemical science.
    In this history of the Atomic Theory, the Doctor states that
the celebrated Berzelius, having compared the quantity of oxy
gen in the base of a salt with the oxygen of its acid, found that
they always bore a simple relation to each other.           " They were
either equal, or the oxygen in the acid was twice as much as that
in the base, or thrice as much, or four times as much, &c. If
   * See Dr. Higgins's
                       Experiments and Observations on Acetous Acid, &c.
printed in 1786, p. 288. I studied with the Doctor at this time, and as
sisted in making all the experiments contained in that work.
                                                                     the

                    On the Origin    of the Atomic Theory.              411
the acid contained twice as much oxygen as the base, this was
a proof that the acid contained two atoms of oxygen              if it con
tained thrice as much, it contained three atoms of oxygen ; and
so on.      Thus in the sulphates the sulphuric acid contains three
limes as much oxygen as the quantity of base which it saturates.
Hence we infer that sulphuric acid is a compound of one atom
of sulphur and three atoms of oxygen.           In the sulphites the acid
contains twice as much as the base, which it saturates.              Hence
we infer that sulphurous acid is composed of one atom of sul
phur and two atoms of oxygen."
    This is a singular mode of ascertaining the quantity of oxygen
in the sulphuric and sulphurous acids.
     I have proved, in my Comparative View, that sulphuric acid
consists of one ultimate particle of sulphur and two of oxygen;
and that sulphurous acid consists of one and one of its con
stituents.                       .                                       . ,
     I have also ascertained that a fresh-made solution of sulphate
of iron contains in the molecule one ultimate particle of iron,
three ultimate particles of oxygen, and one of sulphur, and that
one-third of the oxygen was supplied by the water.
     I will quote the following lines, taken from my Comparative
 Vie w, on this subject*.
     " When potash in solution is poured into a solution of sul
phate of iron, immediate decomposition takes place, sulphate
 of potash is formed, and the iron is disengaged of a darkish blue
 colour, united with one-third the quantity of oxygen necessary
 to its perfect oxidation f.       The iron could not receive this oxy
 gen from the sulphuric acid being found united to the alkali
 in its perfect state, otherwise we should obtain a sulphite of
 potash."
     When the solution of sulphate of iron is exposed to atmo
 spheric air it attracts oxygen, and acquires a yellowish- brown
 colour.      This oxygen must unite to the iron, the sulphuric acid
 having no affinity whatever to oxygen.           During this process a
 yellow oxide is thrown down, which 1 thought at the time 1
 wrote my Comparative View was occasioned by an union of car
  bonic acid to a portion of the oxide, in consequence of the weak
  affinity of the deutoxide of iron to the sulphuric acid.             I also
  supposed that the acid of the oxide deposited must have been
  in a free state in the solution of the sulphate, particularly as the
  sulphate exposed to the operation was as neutral as a solution
  of a metal in an acid could be made.
      But on inquiring into this affair more closely, I found that the
     * See my Atomic Theory, pages 70 and 71.
                                                                          '  '
     f At  that period (1788) I thought there were three oxides of iron; no
  thing has occurred since to induce me to alter my opinion.
                                                              oxysulphate3

412             On the Origin      of the Atomic Theory.
 oxysulphate, after the deposition of the oxide, remained as satu
 rated as the fresh-made sulphate itself previous to the change.
 From the foregoing circumstance, it is probable that a molecule
 of sulphate of iron consists of an atom of peroxide and an atom
 of acid, and that the proportions of its constituent elements are
three of oxygen, one of iron, and one of sulphur ; and that a mole
 cule of oxysulphate consists of an atom of deutoxide of iron and
two atoms of sulphuric acid; consequently its constituent elements
 are four particles of oxygen, one of iron, and two of sulphur.
The foregoing facts do not clash with Berzelius's hypothesis of
 the proportions of oxide in the base and acid of saline substances.
 This yellow oxide dissolves in sulphuric acid diluted with a small
 quantity of water in a moderate heat, and no effervescence takes
 place; which proves that the yellow colour of the oxide of iroil
 is not occasioned by carbonic acid. This subject deserves more
 attention and stricter investigation.    The brown solution or oxy
 sulphate of iron possesses some properties different from the sul
phate, it is no longer crystallizable, and when evaporated to dry
ness the mass is deliquescent.
    I observed in my Comparative View, that during the solution
of metals in nitrous acid they are first oxidized at the expense
 of a portion of the acid itself, and that this oxide is held in so
lution by nitrous acid, which is formed by a peculiar play of af
finities during the chemical action of the ultimate particles of the
materials on each other, while at the same time nitrous gas is
evolved.     The atomical demonstrations given on this subject in
my Comparative View, page 138, or page 126 in my Atomic
Theory, are worthy the attention of chemical readers.
    I estimated this acid in metallic solutions to contain three of
oxygen, and the metallic base two.        When a solution of potash
is poured into a solution of a metallic nitrate, it takes the acid
with one-half the oxygen from the metal, and the nitrate of pot
ash thus formed, consists of the straw-coloured nitrous acid and
the alkaline base.
    Other curious facts, which I noticed in my Comparative View,
on this subject, are worth relating here.       " When iron is intro
duced into nitric acid diluted with sixteen times its bulk of wa
ter it is slowly dissolved, and azote instead of nitrous gas is dis
engaged.      Iron is dissolved in sulphurous acid, and there is no
hydrogen     disengaged   ; if nitric acid be dropped      in, the sul
phurous    acid  is disengaged, and  the nitric acid unites  to the iron
without decomposition of any part of             it,
                                                 for no nitrous gas  is
evolved*." These facts are accounted for on the atomic princi
ple.    The latter fact proves that the atom of nitric acid united

                                                                     in

in toto to the ultimate particle of the iron, which afforded it at
once oxygen of calcination and acid of solution.          This is a proof
that a molecule of nitrate       of iron consists  of five ultimate par
ticles of oxygen, one of azote, and one of iron : or the quantity
of oxygen might be estimated higher, if we suppose that the par
ticle of iron was supplied with one particle of oxygen at the ex
pense of a portion of the sulphurous acid during the solution.
      This 1 am inclined to believe is the case, from the quantity
of sulphur disengaged in the operation.           The solution of nitrate
of iron when exposed to the air is affected like the sulphate of
iron ; it acquires a brownish yellow colour, and a copious yellow
oxide is deposited.
      The red oxide of mercury is dissolved by nitric acid without
 decomposition of any part of the latter, and the molecule must
 contain seven of oxygen.        These facts do not agree with Berze-
 lius's doctrine of the relative proportions of oxygen in the bases
 and acids of saline bodies.
      It was my opinion at the early period in which I brought
 forward the Atomic Theory, that an ultimate atom of a metallic
 oxide and an ultimate atom of an acid unite chemically, and that
  these were their definite proportions.         I am still inclined to
  think that it is the case, with some exceptions, a few of which
  are adduced above : yet it would not be contrary to the laws which
  I established that atoms should unite 1 and 2, like the ultimate
  particles of elementary matter.         We know that sulphate of
  potash will unite with two doses of sulphuric acid, that potash
  will unite with two portions of acid of tartar, that potash will
  also unite to two doses of oxalic acid, although the second dose
  is so strongly attached in the above salts, that nothing but che
  mical means will separate them : yet it appears to me that it i3
  not a chemical union, particularly as those saline substances have
  an acid taste.      It is probably a kind of intermediate influence,
  somewhat similar to what exists between saline substances and
  water, or sugar and water, and gases and water, or alcohol and
  water ; and the union which takes place between two neutral
   salts is of a similar nature.
       The supposition that two atoms of one substance will unite to
   three atoms of another substance is contrary to the laws of the
   Atomic System, as I have shown in my Comparative View, so
   far as relates to the combinations of the ultimate particles of
   elementary matter ; and I should imagine that the same law ex*
   tends to the combination of atoms, for atoms are as distinct or
   insulated from each other as particles.       Therefore I am inclined
   to differ from the calculation of Dr. Thomson, that according to
    the analysis of Berzelius of the sulphate of iron, it consists of
    two atoms of acid and three of oxide.          Now one atom of the
                                                                       acid

  414              On the Origin     of the Atomic Theory.
 acid unites to one atom of oxide ; the second atom of acid will
  attach itself to another atom of oxide, so as to form two distinct
 molecules: — how is the other atom to be disposed of ? It cannot
 divide itself between the two molecules : therefore there must be
  an error in the analysis or in the calculation, or perhaps in both.
 An atom of acid can no more unite to two atoms of its base,
 than a particle of oxygen can unite to two particles of azote, or
 to two particles of hydrogen, although an atom of the base may
  unite to two atoms of acid.
      But to return to the history. " After the preceding historical
  sketch," continues the Doctor, " which we thought necessary in
  order to do justice to all parties concerned in this important
 branch of chemistry, we shall proceed to lay the Atomic Theory
  with the proofs in support of it before our readers*."                 The
 Doctor then proceeds to give the outlines of the Atomic Theory;
  in which it is needless to follow him, for it is a reiteration of my
 own doctrine, the outlines of which 1 have given above.
     The Doctor concludes his article by giving tables,
      1. Of the weight of the ultimate divisions of elementary
 bodies.
     2. Of atoms, and the number of ultimate particles they con
 tain.
     3. Of molecules of three elements, such as those of the vege
 table acids.      This is taken from the analyses of Berzelius. Next
 come the hydrates, and after them the whole tribe of saline bodies,
 all weighed, and the number of their elementary particles aseer*
 tained.      His estimate is taken from the analvses of different
 chemists, but principally from those of Gay Lussac, Thenard,
 and Berzelius.       Thus the Doctor has weighed almost all the
 different kinds of ultimate particles, atoms and molecules, which
 the surface of the globe affords.         What is to become of Dalton,
 for he has not left him a single atom ? It was very unkind td
 take from a man what he discovered himself; and if Dalton had
 not given them ready made to the Doctor, how could he
                                                                      weigh
 them ?
     I felt the importance of the Atomic Theory in my investigation
of the contending doctrines already alluded to, and it was on
that occasion that necessity gave it birth in my mind.
    Berzelius availed himself of the lights this doctrine afforded,
in his analyses of saline substances and vegetable materials;
                                                                         yet
he never claimed any part of the doctrine as his own.
    Mr. Dalton, in his work, claims the whole of it in the iden-

This omission was, no doubt, in order to disguise ; and the same
Omission is still continued for the same purpose.       It is much to
be lamented that this beautiful doctrine should be mutilated of
its best feature, in order to conceal the marks by which its right
ful possessor might have laid claim to his property.           During
rny investigations in my Comparative View, I could accomplish
nothing of any consequence without a knowledge of these relative
forces. In short, they must be restored to the science, in spite of
all interested attempts at their suppression.
    Dr. Thomson steps forward as the advocate of Mr. Dalton,
while he himself stands trembling and silent at the bar of justice.
Unfortunately for the Doctor, he embarked in a very unjust cause
which will never afford him credit, but draw on him the disap
probation of every friend to justice and liberality.
     What prevented Mr. Dalton himself from coming forward in
 his own defence, when Sir H. Davy, very honourably, first an
nounced to the chemical world that I was the original author of
 the Atomic Theory, or when I published my Atomic Theory in
 1SI4, which claimed that doctrine; or when Dr.Crean, of Boston
 in England, took notice of         in the Philosophical Magazine,
                                    ,it
 some time before the above work was written          ?
     The Doctor in defence of his friend, in his Annals of Philoso
 phy, asserts many things which he could not substantiate; and
 when he found that Dalton must renounce his pretensions to
 the Atomic Theory, or that of definite proportions, he endea
 vours to tear it   in pieces, and to divide      between Bergman,

 Black, Cullen, Fordyce, and the Encyclopedie Methodique.
   It  was incumbent on the Doctor to produce extracts from
 those authors, in order to prove his positions.       This no doubt
 he would have done very readily were        in his power.
                                            it
     But in the above distribution he takes care to reserve      arem
 nant for his friend Dalton    ;that is, the weighing of atoms and
 molecules which    I  cut out for him, with the due proportions of
 their respective elements.
     The Doctor takes great pains, vol. iv. p. 54, of his Annals of
 Philosophy, to show that my Comparative View was very little
 known or read.       The following are his observations,   in his own
  words :

    I  will now pass over part of the quotation, and come to the
 conclusion of it.
     " For my own part, as have already said. met with a copy
                                      1                         I

                 I             again; and told Davy at the time, that
                                it
I   could not find the Atomic Theory in it.                     Iput the question
 soon afterwards both to Dr. Henry and Mr. Dalton, and both
 of them assured me they never saw the book."
     Now Dr. Henry published bis Epitome of Chemistry in 1801,
 long before Dalton laid hold of my Atomic Theory and he quotes       ;
 from my Comparative View, second edition,                       inthe 64th page
 of his book.
     The same quotation          given in his fifth edition of the same
                                 is
 work, published in 1805, page Hi.".                In short, he quotes from
 my Comparative View in every           work    of  his that     I have seen.
     How will the Doctor get over this          — ? what could be his motive
 to advance such an erroneous statement                ?    It  was evidently to
 defend Dalton against the suspicion of plagiarism                      for he was
                                                                          :
 aware,     ifHenry   should     be   known     to   be   acquainted      with the
 work, that Dalton       his  neighbour     and   intimate      friend   could   not
be  a   stranger to it.    My Comparative View passed through two
 editions in the course of two years, although                   was printed and
                                                                it
 published at my own expense; therefore                itcould not be so much
 neglected as the Doctor wishes to intimate.                But suppose         sin
                                                                                 a

 the merit of the work.
    But the most remarkable feature of the Doctor's conduct on
this subject         is,
                   that after having endeavoured to give every part
of the Atomic Theory which                 registered in my work to those
                                           is

again to Dalton, in his history         of  the  Atomic Theory as the, -fun
damental principles of estimating the weight of atoms and mole
cules.
    What inconsistency! what prevarication                  !
 I     ckim nothing but what appears in my Comparative View                           ;
and  it     very evident that the definite proportions in which ele
            is
mentary particles unite are there stated for the first time: and
I  defy the Doctor to addude             single instance to the contrary,
                                          a
from any work that appeared before or after mine, except that
of Dalton's. Then the simple question is— to which of us be                      it

    But the Doctor endeavours to persuade the public that the
doctrine consists in the calculation of the weight of particles,
atoms and molecules, and that I had no conception of such a
doctrine.
   Thus the Doctor craftily endeavours to throw the fundamental
principles of the system into the back-ground, while he brings
forward its effects or natural consequences as the theory itself.
Any person that reads my Atomic Theory will readily perceive
that I attended not only to the relative weight of the gases, but
also to that of their elementary particles; and the doctrine of
defmite proportions could never be brought forward by any other
means, as I have already observed.
   Although the Doctor, in defiance of the most glaring evi-.
dences possible, has endeavoured to strip me of the doctrine in
question, I entertain not the smallest doubt but his efforts will
prove abortive.
   Were the Doctor to confme his assertions to his Annals, 1
should make no reply: — nothing but misrepresentations in a great
national work could induce me to step forward ; and it is to be
hoped that the proprietors of that work will, in their next volume,
or in their next edition, correct the errors and prejudices in the
article in question, for in its" present state it is a disgrace to
their pages.
   As my Comparative View has long since been out of print, I
refer the reader to my Experiments and Observations on the
Atomic Theory and Electrical Phcenomena, where the whole of
this affair is more fully stated. It is sold by Longman and Co.,

LXXXIIL    An Account of the Discovery of a Mass of Native
  Iron in Brasil.  By A. F. Mornay, Esq. in a Letter to
  W. H. Woixaston, M.D. Sec. R.S*
Dear Sir, —     Near   five years have elapsed since 1 presented
you   with a specimen of native iron from Brasil.      Particular
reasons prevented me at that time from making it more gene
rally known; and since thdn my private affairs have not allowed
me a moment to look into my notes, and give you this short
account of the block from which your specimen was cut, al
though I have so often promised it you.

418               An Account of the Discovery
  In the autumn of 1810,       I discovered near Bahia    a    spring of
water strongly impregnated with iron, which          was esteemed a
most valuable acquisition in that country-          This circumstance
called to the' recollection of the government, that, about thirty
years before, information had been received of the discovery of
certain thermal springs, situated at the distance of forty or fifty
leagues to the northward ; and as His Royal Highness the Prince
Regent of Portugal had inquired, during his stay at Bahia,
whether the country possessed any thermal waters, 1 was re
quested to visit the spot where thev were supposed to exist.
The governor-general offered me every facility and protection ;
and in order to induce me to undertake the journey, some of
my friends described to me an extraordinary stone which had
been found still further up the countrv, in the same direction.
 It had been supposed to be silver or iron, or that ferruginous
agglomeration so common in Brasil, which often envelopes gold,
and I believe sometimes diamonds.           On the other hand, some
 persons   who  pretended   to  have     it,
                                      seen    asserted thatit   was not
a mass of any metal, but had only the metallic sound on being
struck, common to numerous blocks of stone in the same neigh
bourhood, called     by   the inhabitants " serpent stones," in con
 sequence of their exfoliating     by    decomposition at the surface.
 As the serpent casts his skin yearly, so they suppose these stones
 to do.
    Some account of the discovery of this extraordinary mass had
been given to the government of Bahia, and through the in
 spector-general of the militia,  a     man of great talents and con
siderable learning,  I   obtained a sight of the papers on the sub
ject existing at the Government-house.         On reading them,   I  was
 decidedly of opinion, that the mass described was native or me
 teoric iron, and determined to go to see it.
                I                                    But before relate
                                                                I
 my own observations,     I  will give you the substance of the notes
 whichI    took out of those papers.
    In the year 1784,  a    man of the name of Bernardino da Mota
 Botelho, while looking after his cattle, noticed the block in
 question, as being different from all the other stones on the spot,
 and informed the governor-general of the province of Bahia of
 his observation.     His excellency immediately ordered the head
 man of  a   neighbouring village, that is   to say, at the distance of
 near fifty leagues, to go and examine it.          He did so, and re
 ported very marvellous things, calling the mass sometimes iron,
 and sometimes stone, but giving to understand that       it contained
 gold and silver.     The governor-general       commanded him, in
 consequence, to have     it conveyed to Bahia.      This man returned
 to the spot, and after having excavated round the block, so as
 to be able to get the ends of four powerful levers under           it,
                                                                      he
                                                              contrived

               of a Mass of Native Iron in Brasil.               4 19
Contrived by great exertion, with the assistance of thirty men, to
turn it on its side. He observed the bed on which it rested to
be of the same scaly substance that was attached to the bottom
of the mass, and about eighteen inches thick.
    About the latter end of 1785, he conveyed to the spot a wag
gon, or rather a truck built for the purpose, and succeeded in
getting the mass of iron into it; but having spent three days in
this operation, the men employed were obliged to depart, in
consequence of the neighbouring rivulet being brackish, and not
fit to be drunk.     They returned, however, and yoked oxen to
the truck, but they could not move it until they had put on
twenty pair of oxen on each side.        You must observe that their
oxen are not of the strength of ours, that the ground was a loose
gravel, and that the truck was constructed on the very worst
plan, the wheels being fixed to the axletrees, and the two axle-
trees remaining constantly in a parallel position with respect to
each other.
    They proceeded, however, in this manner to the distance of
about one hundred yards, when they got into the bed of the ri
vulet above mentioned, called the Bendego. There it was stopped"
by the prominent point of a rock ; and as the truck was only cal
culated to move in a straight line, it was abandoned.
    I "visited this mass on tiie 17th of January 1811, and found
it still on the waggon or truck, where it had been lying for five-
and-twenty years.       It is situated near the left bank of the ri
vulet, but entirely in its bed, which was then dry, and is very
seldom otherwise.
    I send you a very correct outline of this mass. (PI. V.) It is
about seven feet long, four feet wide, and two feet in thickness,
besides a sort of foot on which it now stands, of about six
inches in height.         The solid contents, however, cannot be
inferred correctly from these dimensions, since the broad part is
hollowed out underneath very considerably.         After making due
allowance for the cavities, I estimated on the spot, the solid
contents of the whole mass to be at least twenty-eight cubic
feet, which at 500 lbs. will make its weight to be 14,000 lbs.
    Its colour is exactly that of a chesnut, and is glossy at the
top and sides, but the hollow part underneath is covered with ;v
 crust in thick flakes, outwardly of the colour of rust of iron, and
staining the fingers.       The flakes are very brittle, and the fresh
fracture is black and brilliant, like some magnetic iron ores.
    The glossy surfaces of the block are not smooth, but slightly
indented all over, as if they had been hammered with a rather
large round-headed hammer.
    There are several cavities in  it, from the diameter of twelve-
                                                           a
pound cannon ball, to that of musket-ball; the larger ones being
                               a             '

420               An Account of     the Discovery
shallow, but the others much deeper.      They all contain the sarftfe
substance as is attached to the great cavity underneath, and
some of them also fragments of quartzous stones, which I was
obliged to break in the holes in order to get them out.
   The brown colour of the surface of the block is merely a very
thin coat of rust, for the slightest scratch with a knife produces
a bright white metallic streak ; and yet, wherever the mass is
struck with a steel, it gives out sparks abundantly.
   When rubbed with a quartzous pebble in the dark, it becomes
beautifully luminous.
   The block is magnetic, and even possesses well marked poles.
In the outline I have indicated their position. The N. pole is
not so well characterized at the shorter point of the same end.
   The N. pole of the block lies at present nearly E.N.E.; be
fore it was removed it lay about N.N.E.      I ought to tell you that
La Mota Botelho, who first noticed this object, accompanied
me, and, as he was present at its removal, he was able to give
me much information, being a very intelligent man.
   The N. pole is by much the most massive end, and lay deeper
in the ground than the other.
   No part of the mass has the power of attracting iron filings,
whether the spot have been filed to brightness or not.
   1 had provided     myself with a sledge hammer and tools for
 cutting off some specimens of the iron, but it was with the ut
most difficulty that I could detach the few small pieces which
you have seen, one of which I gave to you on my arrival in Eng
land.    The largest I presented to my Lord Dundas, to whom           I
am under many obligations, and who promised to place it in
the collection of the Geological Society.     I also presented frag
ments to our lamented friend Mr. Tennant, and to Dr. Marcet.
Another specimen, beautifully crystallized, I disposed of to Mr.
Heuland, and I have only some small pieces left. As soon as
the first piece was detached, I was struck with the appearance
of internal crystallization not hitherto noticed in meteoric iron ;
but as your specimen shows this circumstance very well, I need
not describe it.
   None of the fragments possess magnetic poles.,
   No vitreous substance appears about the mass, as in many of
the known blocks of meteoric iron.
   Having taken a few reagents with me, for the examination of
the thermal springs which had been pointed out to me, I tried
the malleable part of the mass on the spot, for nickel, and I
thought at the time that its presence was indicated ; but I am
now satisfied that the phenomena which I noticed, might have            .
arisen from iron alone.
   I have found my specimens more liable to rust, I think, than
                                                             wrought

                 of a Mass of Native Iron in Brasil.             421
 wrought iron generally is ; and in a damp atmosphere a liquid
oozes out from the crevices.
     I repaired to the spot where the mass was discovered, namely
on a rising ground on the left bank of the river Bendego, and
 caused the soil and gravel to be removed until we came to the
bed described in the government documents.          We found it at
less than three feet depth.      I had expected to find in it a con
siderable protuberance, such as might have fitted the cavity un
derneath the mass of iron, for I was convinced that the block
itself must have been firmly attached to the bed, otherwise it
would not have required such a considerable power to turn it on
its side.
    However, I did not ; and thinking that we were not exactly
on the spot, I caused two trenches to be opened down to the bed,
and crossing each other, the one being between two and three
yards long, and the other between one and two.         Every part of
the bed that was uncovered was perfectly flat and horizontal,
except where we dug first ; there it was broken, and, according
to the statement of La Mota Botelho, that was done when the
block was removed.
    I found no termination to the bed in the directions' of the
trenches, and at the spot where the mass had lain, it was about .
one foot thick, or hardly so much ; but at one end of the longer
trench, not above three inches.      I did not break through it any
where else.     Nearly the same loose gravel appears underneath
the bed as over it.     I brought away specimens of the bed, which
I  considered extremely curious, supposing them to contain
nickel. On my return to England 1 told you, therefore, that I
hoped I had found iron ore containing nickel; for I thought that
the bed, on which had rested the mass, was one of those of
which there are so many all over the province.       But as 1 gave
you some specimens, I will not describe it.
   The surface of the soil, or rather coarse gravel, at the spot, is
about ten or fifteen feet above the main granite rock of the
country.
   I   can only give you an approximation of the latitude and lon
gitude of the place.      The sun was much too high at noon to
take its altitude with a sextant and mercurial horizon ; and the
artificial horizon, which I had been compelled to construct my
self, occasioned such a loss of light, as to make it impossible to
observe the southern stars for determining the latitude.        Dif
ferent altitudes of the sun at a distance from the meridian, did
not give me satisfactory results.      I had with me an excellent
watch, and having computed the latitude to be about 10° 2<Y S.
I concluded the longitude to be 33' 15" W. of Bahia, after
making every allowance, and comparing this result with those
                              D d3                         obtained

422               An   Account   of the Discovery
obtained before and afterwards, at the house of Major Dantas,
called Camuciata, near Itapicuru.
    The rapidity of growth in plants is wonderful in the neigh
bourhood of the Bendego, although the main granite rock is
so near the surface as to protrude in many places ; and what
lies on it is chiefly a coarse gravel, consisting of rolled fragments
 of quartz, felspar and granite of the size of eggs, together with
 smaller pebbles and sand, which contains, of course, a great deal
 of mica, but hardly any vegetable earth.
    At about forty leagues to the southward, are found hills of
yellow and red sandstone, in which organic remains have not
 been found ; while to the northward there is a formation of si
milar hills, in which are observed most beautiful impressions of
 whole fishes and remains of vegetables.
    Between the Bendego and the sandstone hills to the south
ward, 1 observed a great deal of what I certainly take to be ba
salt.   I met with balls from the diameter of two inches to that
 of upwards of three feet, and numberless prisms, with three and
with six faces, scattered about ; all of these small, that is to sav,
about three or four inches in length, and two or three in dia
meter.
    To the southward of the sandstone hills is a sandy plain, al
most barren, extending many miles, perhaps sixty or eighty,
east and west to the sea, but not twenty in breadth, where I
crossed it. Small conical hillocks are scattered over         it,some
of which, the largest, have flat tops, and appear all to be of the
same height, about twenty fathoms.
    Appearances impressed me with the idea, that they were the
remains of  a    plain which formerly extended over the one on
which I   then stood, but which had been washed away in            tu
                                                                    a
multuous manner      by   a violent current running nearly in an
easterly direction.     The larger hillocks appear to be stratified,
but they consist of loose sandy materials, except in so far as they
contain beds of  a    dark-red iron ore, containing imbedded mi
nute crystals of magnetic iron ore the thickness of these bed*
                                     :                                  is
about two inches, and they are exactly similar to those which
are found in the clay hills of Bahia.
   The smaller hillocks consist of confused heaps of gravel and
loose stones, intermixed with a very large quantity of the same
iron ore in fragments, and lumps     of  manganese, very compact,
and of steel-gray colour, containing arsenic, but apparently no
      a
iron.
  *
    The dreary appearance of this plain      increased
                                              is         by
                                                         the nu
merous nests of cupim (white ants) standing upright like so
many tombstones.     On being viewed nearer, they are conical,
rather compressed, so that the base    elliptic. All those which
                                         is
                                 -                    I   examined

                of a Mass of Native Iron         in   Brasil.             423
I   examined were precisely of the same shape.          The materials of
 which they consist are white sand, whitish clay, and particles of
 wood.
     Many of them were full five feet in height.
      The soil of the valleys and low grounds, which are occasionally
 swampy, is abundantly impregnated with sea-salt, which the in
 habitants wash out for their own consumption ; but it contains
 some bitter salts, which render it purgative to those who are not
 accustomed to it.
     The thermal springs which were pointed out to me, were se
 veral, but they hardly deserve the name.
     One of them was at 86 ' of Fahrenheit when the atmosphere
  was at 81°.
     Another was at 88°, when the atmosphere was at 77 \° ; and
 also at 88°, when the atmosphere was at 80°.
     The water of both of these is the purest 1 had ever seen.
 Mauy small fish were swimming in the basin of the last, from
 which runs, at all seasons, a considerable rivulet.
     A third was at D0\ when the atmosphere was at 73°. The
 water very pure.
     A fourth was at 101°, when the atmosphere was at Sof"'; also
 at 101", when the atmosphere was at 93°.
                                                                            *
     Taste of the water rather ferruginous, and very brackish, ex-
 tremely disagreeable and nauseous.          No peculiar smell, and
 very transparent, although it deposits iron and lime, and an
 iridescent film is formed on its surface.      Contains no sulphuret
 ted gas.     The rocks of the neighbourhood contain pyrites not
 Biaguetie.
     This spring is called the Mai-d'agoa, and is situated on the
 left bank of the river Itapicurfi, near the water's edge, at a short
 distance from a place called the Mato-do-eip6\
     It was during this journey that I had an opportunity of seeing
 that curious plant called Cipo de ctmanam.         It grows abundantly
 between Monte Santo and the river Bendego.              It is a climbing
 plant destitute of leaves; it was so when I saw           it,
                                                            and  I  believe
it   to be always the same  ;   itbears no thorns     but often growing
                                                      ;
 so as to form an impenetrable plica which the cattle will hardly
 approach, much less attempt to break through, because when the
juice of this plant sticks to their hair.it occasions blisters and great
 irritation.  It   contains a  milkv juice, and suppose that
                                                  I                 it   an

 beautifully luminous line, which was not transient, but lasted

not observe any particular smell.          The milky juice is said to be
very poisonous; it is caustic, and occasions much itching and
irritation when applied to the skin.          It becomes viscous in the
air,   and  soon  dries  of  a yellowish colour, slightly tinged with
green, when it has the appearance of a gum-resin.

 LXXXIV.        Observations and Experiments on the Mass of Na
     tive Iron found in Brasil.        By W. H. Wollaston, M.D.
     Sec. R.S*
 The      preceding letter from Mr; Mornay, relating to the dis
 covery of a mass of native iron in Bahia, was drawn up at my
 request, as a valuable addition to our stock of knowledge on that
 most curious subject ; and I am in hopes that the results of my
 own experiments may contribute something not uninteresting to
 the Society.
     The specimen of the iron with which Mr. Mornay very li
 berally supplied me for experiment, though it necessarilv bears
 marks of the hammer by which it has been detached, presents
 also other surfaces, not only indicating that its texture is cry
 stalline, but showing also the forms in which it is disposed to
 break, to be those of the regular octohedron and tetrahedron,
 or rhomboid, consisting of these forms combined.
     In my own specimen, the crystalline surfaces appear to have
 been the result of a process of oxidation, which has penetrated
 the mass to a considerable depth in the direction of its laminae ;
 but in the specimen which is in the possession of the Geological
 Society, the brilliant surfaces that have been occasioned by forci
 ble separation from the original mass^ exhibit also the same

       The magnetic qualities of the fragments, fortunately, enable
   as to appreciate rightly those of the entire mass from which
    they have been detached ; tor though the mass, when tried upon
    the spot by Mr. Mornay, gave indications of having distinct
    N. and S. poles, it is pretty clear that these were only so by in
   duction, in consequence of position with respect to the magnetic
    meridian.     For though the fragments are not in the least at
    tractive as magnets, and have in themselves no polarity, they
    are preciselv like anv other pieces of the best soft iron, and as
    sume polarity instantlv, according to the position in which they
    are held with respect to the magnetic axis of the earth.        When
    a long fragment is held in a vertical position, its lower extremity
    being then within 20° of the dip of the N. magnetic pole, be
    comes N and repels the N pole of a magnetic needle suspended
    horizontally. But this power is instantly reversed by being
    suddenlv inverted.      So that the apparent contradiction between
    the observed polarity of the mass, and the seeming want of it iu
    the fragments, is thus completely removed.
       Although Mr. Mornay reasonably expected that this iron
    would not differ from the many others now on record that have
    been found in various parts of the world, and from his experi
    ments was led to infer the presence of nickel, it appeared de
    sirable te ascertain this point with more precision than he had
    been enabled to do, and to determine also in what proportion
    this peculiar ingredient of meteoric bodies might be found to
    prevail.
        I believe the means which I am accustomed to employ for
    detecting the presence of nickel in native iron to be new, and
    may deserve to be described, on account of the very small quan
    tity of the iron required for this mode of examination.
       Having filed from my specimen as much as 1 judged sufficient
    for my purpose, (which need not exceed , J-j- of a grain,) I dis
    solved it in a drop of nitric acid, and then evaporated the solu
    tion to drvness. A drop or two of pure ammonia was then
    added to the dried residuum, and gently warmed upon-it in or
    der to dissolve any nickel that might be present.         The trans
     parent part  of the  fluid was then led by the end of a rod  of glass
    to a small distance from the remaining oxide of iron,        and   the
    addition of triple prussiate of potash immediately detected the
    presence of nickel by the appearance of a milky cloud, which
    was not discernible by the same means from a similar quantity
    of common wrought iron tried at the same time.
. . -  For the determination of the quantity of nickel I employed a
                                                                 different

426         On a Mass     of Native Iron found in Brasil.
different method.        A piece of the iron weighing fifty grains
having been dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, the solution was
evaporated to drvness.        Ammonia was then added, and the so
lution again evaporated to dryness, in order that the oxide of
iron might be rendered more dense, and more easily separated
from the soluble portion.        A fresh addition of ammonia then
readily dissolved the nickel, and the solution after filtration ap
peared of a deep-blue colour.
    A small quantity of sulphuric acid having then been added,
the whole was again evaporated not merely to dryness, but with
sufficient heat to expel the excess of ammonia, muriate of am
monia, and sulphate of ammonia.          The remainder was sulphate
of nickel, which was then redissolved in water, and after being
 suffered to crystallize, weighed 8*6 grains.        Having found by
 experiment previously made for that purpose, that ten grains of
 nickel give 44 grains of sulphate of nickel, I infer that S"6 of
 the sulphate correspond to 1*95 of metallic nickel, which is
 nearly 4 per cent, of the quantity of native iron taken for ex
periment.
    By an analysis conducted in a similar manner on 23 grains of
 the scaly flakes of oxide brought home by Mr. Morn ay, from
 the spot where the mass was found, I obtained 3*1 grains of sul
 phate of nickel, which correspond to 7 '05 nickel, amounting to
 no more than 3-06 per cent, of the oxidated crust taken for
 analysis.   But, if we consider the weight which 100 parts of the
 metallic alloy would acquire by oxidation, we shall find the two
 experiments correspond with a degree of accuracy that may oc
 casion more reliance to be placed on these experiments than
 they really deserve.
                 96 parts of iron in the state of black oxide will be
 combined with 28-3 oxygen
 and                4    nickel will take
 about               l'l oxygen,
so that          1 29*4   of the crust will contain only four parts  of
metallic nickel, and      100 ditto will contain 3-l, which   scarcely
exceeds the quantity actually found by trial.
    From the presence of nickel in this mass we cannot         but re^
gard it as having the same meteoric origin with the            various
other specimens that have before been found ; and although in
the spot whence it had been first removed, Mr. Mornay disco
vered a bed of matter from which it appears, by analysis, that
similar iron might be formed by art, it seems by far more pro
bable, that an opposite change has really taken place, and that
the whole of this supposed ore is the result of progressive oxi

LXXXV.        Remarks and Suggestions, for further improving and
    applying to Use, the Government Trigonometrical Survey of
     Great Britain. — By Mr. John Farey Sen.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —     I am much pleased to observe in a contemporaneous
Journal, that the Trigonometrical Survey of Britain, which        has
so long been in progress, is beginning more generally to attract
the attention of ingenious Men, towards giving to its results,
everv possible degree of perfection and usefulness, of which thev
are susceptible.    In one of the communications alluded to, dated
October 1816, I read as follows; viz. "There is also an eminent
 Geologist, Dr. MacCulloch, connected with the work : and at
this moment, I believe, going from station to station with Col.
 Mudge and Capt. Colby, or with which ever of those Gentlemen
 may be now in Scotland."
     It would give me very sincere pleasure to find this latter an
nouncement to have been correct, but of which I can have little
 expectation, from having, when on a survey of the environs of
 Edinburgh in the last autumn, been so fortunate, as to have met
Capt. Colby, at his station on the Pentland Hills nearest to
 Edinburgh ; when, in a conversation principally turning on the
 internal structure of the surrounding District, between a Gentle
 man of the vicinity, whom I met in the Captain's Tent, and my
 self, I heard from him or Capt. C. no hint, of such a valuable
 addition having been made to the Trigonometrical         Establish
  ment.
     I the more lament this circumstance, from having always de
 sired, and made frequent attempts at recommending the making,
 of a minute Mineral Survey and Map of the Environs of each
  Station, since I became acquainted in 1801, with the new Prin
  ciples of Mineral Surveying, and with the progress then made
  in applving them, in extensive practice, by Mr. fVilliam Smith,
  for acquiring satisfactory and practically useful knowledge of the
  internal structure of a District, from the accurate investigation
  and consideration of its surface: an art, forwhich posterity will do
  Mr. S. ample justice, however long interested, Lecturing, Book-
  making and Map-making and publishing parties amongst us may
  succeed, in suppressing his name and achievements, and in unjustly
                                                               appro

 428               Mr.   Farey's Suggestions, as to
 appropriating his labours to themselves, some of them:— but             I
 must restrain for the present my feelings on this unpleasant sub
ject, and with the hope of drawing the attention of your scien
tific Correspondents to the subject of the National Trigonome
trical Survey, I will beg to transcribe a Letter, which in the last
 Spring I addressed to a public Man, whose useful labours have
laid our country under lasting obligations to him : viz.
                                                   « Mnrcfi 26, 18f6.
   " Sir, — I                                       of yesterday,
                am very greatly obliged by your letter
 and in consequence of the information (new to me), as to the
 intended experiments on a Pendulum, at the principal Trigo
 nometrical Stations, beg permission, without delay, to offer to
 the consideration of your very active and superior mind, a few
 suggestions connected with this subject.
   "  First, I would beg to recommend, that the London pen
 dulum observation should be made, on the floor of St. Paul's
 Cathedral, or of St. Faith's church under       it,
                                               exactly under the
  Cross above the dome, which            most popular and well settled
                                  it is
 point  in the  Trig. Survey,    and a  will be very desirable, thatsi
 milar observations be made, as near as possible to      (E    or W of),
 the Transit Instrument in Greenwich Observatory; and that
 progressively, these pendulum observations should be made, at
 every, or at many, and those greatly distributed, Trig. Stations.
    " Second, That     by   the accurate and ready means which the
 Canals now furnish, and levellings for such, which have been
 accurately made and recorded, when collected, examined and
 compared, and by other cross levellings from these Canals to the
 Sea (none of which would now require to be very long), to as
 certain the Elevation      of each Trig. Station, much more accu
 rately  and satisfactorily  than  has yet been done.
    " Third, am extremely desirous, for the interest of Seience
             I
and the honour of our Age, that every possible precision should
be given to our Trig. Survey, by employing (at the same time
with the pendulum) the capital Zenith Sector, which the nation
has purchased, and has long and often,    I    believe, lain unemployed
in the Tower, in settling the Latitudes, from actual observations;
so often and carefully repeated, on the Stars, at each Trig. Sta
tion (and if   confirmed    by  Pole-star observations the better), as>
to leave no remaining doubts, on this very important head.
    " Doubtless, sir, you are acquainted with the able calcula
tions and statements of doubts hereon, in the Phil. Trans. by
Don Rodrigue,    a    few years ago; and perhaps also, with the
virulent and improper attack on the Roy. Soc. for admitting the
Don's paper, and the refusals given, to repeat observations, or
            by
otherwise,  a       proper defence, to remove these doubts, by a
                                                              person,

person, too immediately dependent on Colonel M. as head of the
Woolwich Academy, to have been by any means decent or pro
per, in my estimation, or that of many very competent persons,
with whom I have conversed on the subject.
   " From having, when in the late Duke of Bedford's employ,
paid considerable attention to the principles, practice and proi-
gress of the Trig. Survey, in and around Bedfordshire,            and
having made a very great number of careful observations, with
each of the very admirable Theodolites they use, and recorded,
and applied these in a multitude of minutely accurate calculations
of intersecting Triangles, and having thus obtained the most
ample and satisfactory checks, on the results as to Angles (when
often enough observed) and lengths of calculated Lines, I am
able to concur most fully with Don R. who has in another mode
gone over the whole calculations anew, that the net-work of
lines spread over the surface of our Island by this Survey (in
cluding the measured bases) are of indisputable accuracy; hut
no persons, except some in the Woolwich Acad., who can be
deemed competent, will I think be found to say, that the other
important data, for turning this grand Survey to the physical or
philosophical uses of which it is susceptible. have yet been de
termined, within any degree of corresponding or sufficient ac
curacy, to these mere Lines, every three of them in different and
almost unknown planes, strictly speaking.
    " That as already (and secondly) observed, there wanting,
           is,                                           is
 the actual heights of each Station, with reference to     a   curved
surface  of equilibrium  (as yet, of unknown  form,  exactly) formed
by the Sea, around our Island, and to other nearly similar and
parallel higher curved surfaces, inland, which are followed       by
                                                                  the
several Canal-ponds (with some connecting levellings, which are
wanting), in connected net-work, over the Island's surface.
              a
    " Fourth, The ascertaining,      by  very numerous repetitions,
under proper and fully recorded circumstances, of heat, pressure,
moisture, clouds, &c. the oppurent angular elevation or depres
sion, of each Station, with every other visible from       it ;  with
much Larger and letter Instruments,       than have yet been used
for this purpose  ;  two of which Instruments should, as often as
possible, be simultaneously used    in  observations, at each end of
a line between Stations.     Calculations from these elevations and
depressions, would    by  comparison with the actual heights, fur
nish dula, now exceedingly wanted         byAstronomers and Trigo
nometrical Surveyors, for determining the Refractions at very
 low elevations, some even below the horizontal line (see Phil.
 Mag. vol. xlvii. p. 23) and other more considerable elevations,
                        ;
between Church-Towers, &c. in valleys, near Canals (already
                                                                  well

  rounding Hills, might be selected, for making this series of ob
  served data, as to refraction, join to and blend with the lower
  ones already obtained by Astronomers.
,
     " Fifth, Very carefully ascertaining the horizontal bearings,
  or Azimuths, of the lines of Triangles, with the Meridian, at
  every Station; which yet has been done at a few orrly, and at
 fewer still, in a quite satisfactory manner.
     " Sixth, The difference of time, or longitude, to be deter
 mined, by often repeated signal-lights, made and observed at
  the opposite ends of all such long lines of the Triangles, as have
  nearly an E and W direction.         For which last purpose, if two
  exactly similar apparatuswere provided, and simultaneouslyused,
  in the Pendulum observations, mentioned in your last Letter,
  the time or trouble of the same, might not be materially in
  creased, by combining these very important longitude observa
  tions.
     "  Seventh, That the Strata, for a circle of three or four Miles
 around each station, should be carefully surveye'd and mapped,
  in connection with Mr. Smith's Map of the Strata, which may
  then sufficiently supply information, as to most of the interme
 diate parts of the Island's surface.                     '
                                                            .
      " Eighth, That the direction and degree of the general dip
  of the Strata, at each station, should be carefully ascertained,
.and a vertical Section in that direction, made through the sta
  tion, of three or four Miles long on each' side of the station,
  either equally so or otherwise, and other cross Sections, in any
  case where the Station proved to be on, or near to a ridged or
  curved plane of strata (as is not very uncommon) ; thus showing
 the actual thicknesses and forms, and describing the positions of
 the several strata, as deep as could, without any material expense
  of sinking on the bassets, be ascertained.
     " Ninth, That experiments on the specific gravities of Spe
 cimens of the Stones or Earths, &c. forming each distinct stra
 tum, shown in the Maps and Sections, collected at proper di
 stances below the surface, at several points in the course of each
 stratum, should be made, on or near to the spot, before the drying
 or partial decomposing of such Specimens; and that ample and
numerous duplicates of all such Specimens, should be labelled
 and preserved, and deposited in the National Collection (by
 Mr. Smith and others) for illustrating the British Strata, now
 forming in the British Museum ; together with copies of the
 Maps and Sections, having marked on them the exact site of
 each of such Specimens.
     *f No progress whatever has
                                    yet been made by the Trig. Sur
                                                              veyors,

Particulars connected with           the late   Earthquake in Scotland. 431
veyors, I believe (although its propriety was strongly urged, and
the. means shown for accomplishing it, 14 or more years ago),
in collecting the data mentioned (Seventh, Eighth and Ninth),
although so very important; and such as might, I think, prove
satisfactory, towards calculating the direction of the plumb-line,
as affected by the local attractions of the Strata, near each.
Station ; and notwithstanding the same is also so important,
towards settling the lengths of degrees of the Meridian and of
Longitude ; and which, thus determined, might secure to this
 Nation, not only the honour offirst efficiently investigating and
mapping the surface of the Strata, in anv Country (by Mr.
Smith and his pupils) but al,o of applying this to scientific use.
    " Before I conclude : permit me to express a hope, at the
same time that our Yard and the French Metre are compared,
 that a not less useful (and corroborative) comparison may also
be made, of our best ascertained or adopted standard Pound,
 avoirdupoise, and the Gramme of France.

         The evening of Tuesday the 13th of August was distinguished
    by   no particular appearance in this part of Scotland (Fifeshire)            ;
but before six o'clock          on Wednesday morning, when my work

   people were coming to their labour^ they all expressed a
    considerable degree of astonishment at the extraordinary num*

   The number was far beyond any thing ever seen before, except
   when they assemble before their departure far the season.
       The swallows continued to       fly
                                        about the field for some days,
   and then dispersed.         They had   abandoned their young to

   and Leslie, but nowhere nearer, nor round Loch Leven, that           I
   can learn.    But on Thurs'day morning about nine o'clock an
   old man, George Braid, who has lived in this neighbourhood*
   and been working as bleacher, waulker, &c. upon the banks of
   Leven, all his life, had just come to the field to waulk some
  plaidings, and had gone to let down the bye sluice.       His atten
                                I by
  tion seemed quite arrested         some appearance in the stream.
   Standing at  a  little distance, called to him, " What's the mat
   ter, George ?"    "  Gome and see," was his reply.      I went and
  observed the water perfectly thickened with moss, clay, sand, and
  every description of mud, to  a   most extraordinary degree.    This
  was the more remarkable as the women had just fmished washing
  a parcel of yarns, when the stream was clean and clear as usual.
I    observed to the old man, — that the mud and dirt must be the
  effect of the millers cleaning out Arnott mill dam, and would soon
  go by.
             " No," said he, " that not Arnott mill dam, nor will
                                       is
      go by for these eight-and-forty hours at least."

  similar appearance before? " Never," said he, " but once; and
  that was when an earthquake happened at Comrie and be as :
  sured there has an earthquake happened somewhere, be where
 it may."
     Nothing of an earthquake had been felt here, nor had the
 slightest knowledge of any such thing reached this place at the
 time of this conversation.  Struck with the old man's remarks,
 and  his manner  of making them, went up the river to the junc

From the top of the bridge the appearance of the water indi
cated   the same state of filth.  Curiosity prompted a further
survey.    The stream was followed to the lake, where the whole
mass of waters was found dirtier, if possible, than the stream
that flowed from it.  From pretty accurate experiments, the time
necessary for the water just emptying itself from the lake, to
reach Auchmoor bridge, has been ascertained ; and upon that
data we calculated, by the time the mud reached the held, at
what time the shock must have been felt in the lake, and marked
it to have taken place some time between eleven and twelve on
 Tuesday night.
   Judge then our surprise, when the old man's remarks were
so fully confirmed by accounts from the north in so short a pe
riod after.
   The agitation in the lake must have been dreadful, had it been
day-light to render it visible.   The quantity of mud and sand
thrown up from the depth of 80 to 100 feet must have been
very extraordinary, when it continued so long dirty, though it had
the lake itself and the slow windings of a number of miles through
a flat country to subside in.    The water continued to run dirty
for two days ; so much so, that we could neither work nor put
our yarns through any operation during that period.
LXXXVII.       Remarks on the Article           "Strength of Materials ,"
  published in Dr.      Rees's        New Cyclopcedia, vol. xxxiv. part i.
  By A Correspondent.
   he author of the article " Strength of Materials," after stating
that we have two or three theories by different authors, proceeds
to say, that " it unfortunately happens that we owe all these
theories to men who have not themselves made any experiments."
So far, perhaps, as respects Galileo, Leibnitz, James Bernoulli,
Euler, and Lagrange, the authors particularly alluded to, it is
correct ; but it is to Marriotte, whom the author has classed
with the experimental writers, that we are indebted for the first
Outline of the true theory; and the whole of his experiments
were made with a view to illustrate and confirm the premises he
had assumed.    Marriotte's mathematical investigation only ap
plies to rectangular prisms ; therefore, his experiments, being
made with cylinders, do not agree correctly with his theory.
Marriotte's theory was published in his Traite da Mouvement
des EanX, sect. v. disc.    *.  ii.

494     Remarks on the          Article    "    Strength of Materials"
Sontal position ; Bernoulli, Euler and Lagrange, the strength in
a vertical position: in the former the depth is the variable
quantity, in the latter the length and depth are both of them
variable : hence the theory of Euler differs from that of Galileo
or Leibnitz only in the position of the beam.              . . .
   Leibnitz, Belidor*, Emersonf, and other writers, have fol
lowed only part of Marriotte's theory, admitting the extension
to be as the force, but supposing the axis of fracture to be at the
lower side of the beam.      Leibnitz and Emerson have on these
principles attempted to determine the strength of triangular
prisms, &c. and have arrived at the most absurd conclusions.
    The author treats the subject under three separate heads, and
begins with " the direct cohesion of bodies."            The strength of
bodies   to  resist a strain in direction of their length is stated to
be as their areas; but, allowing the material to be uniform, this
can only be the case under a certain limitation, which is not
even hinted at in the present article, though it is the cause of
 the irregularity of Buffon's experiments on the strength of iron.
As every material will extend in some degree before fracture
 takes place, there is a point in the section of fracture through
which the direction of the weight must pass; otherwise, the
section will not be equally strained,            and consequently the
strength will not be as the area.
   To determine the centre of resistance, and to fmd the law
which the strength would follow, when the direction of the
 weight does not pass through             it,
                                        would be curious as well as an
                                                       a
useful subject of mathematical inquiry.
  A   want of attention to the direction of the weight          the most

likely cause of the strength in certain experiments not being as
the area (see Phil. Mag. vol, x. p. 51).         As to the different re
sults obtained     bydifferent experimentalists,; — the various qualities
of the same kind of material, the duration of the experiments,
and other physical circumstances considered, — they agree as well
as could be expected        the highest numbers are most likely to be

                                            is
when pressed longitudinally," &c, which certainly should have
followed that on the transverse strength, not only on account                            of,
its being more difficult, but also because           only

age.     The author passes over this division of his subject without
even attempting         theoretical investigation; indeed the " intriv,

ters are not calculated to encourage an English author to ven
ture on the subject.
    Were we in possession of a correct and simple theory, — and the
thing is not impossible, though Euler and Lagrange have failed
in their attempts, — it might be applied to practice without any
other experimental knowledge than that to be derived from ex
periments made on beams or bars laid horizontally.           Neverthe
less, it would have been interesting to have had the tables of
 Girard in English weights and measures, which certainly ought
to have been done, as in its present state it is nearly useless to
the English reader.        The manner of giving Buffun's experi
ments is still less excusable, because they would have been better
in their original form than as they are.
    The experiments on the strength of stones, which are taken
from the Encyclo. Britannica, were published by M. Gauthey,
in 1774, in Rozier's Journal de Physique, and were made in
consequence of a Memoir which M. Patte published in 1770, in
which he expressed his doubts respecting the stability of the
 pillars which support the dome of the French Pantheon.            The
 celebrated Soufflot, having heard of these experiments, con
structed a machine similar to that used by Gauthey, and Perror
 net made a third ; but it was perceived, in the course of their
 experiments, that the friction and change of position of the
 lever were so considerable as to influence the results.        To re
 medy these defects a new machine was invented by M. Rondelet,
 .with which numerous experiments have been made.            These are
 published   in his  Trail 5 de I' Art de Batir, tome   iii. p. 81, to
 gether with a description of the machine.       It is to  be regretted
 that the direct cohesion of the stones crushed by this machine
 has not been ascertained. — But to return to the author of the
 article: He says, " We are aware that in different materials a
 different law may be observed between the strength of direct
 cohesion and the resistance of the same body to a transverse
 strain." It would be desirable to have some further parti'culars
 if this really be the fact, but I should rather suspect the writer
 to be mistaken.
    The third division is " on the transverse strain and strength of
 beams." &c. The theories of Galileo and Leibnitz present such
 erroneous results when applied to any other than rectangular
 beams, that it is surprising, where a want of space is more than
 once complained of, so much should be occupied in discussing
 them, to the exclusion of other valuable matter ; — for instance, the
 resistance to twisting, and also what Dr. Young calls resilience
 and detrusion, might have been introduced.         In the account of
 the experiments of Du Hamel there is a mistake, which also oc-
                                E e 2                              curs

 436     Remarks on the Article    " Strength   of Materials," &c.
 curs in Dr. Robison's account of them.         There were only two
  bars cut one-third through, and only two cut half through ; see
  Du Hamel's Transport du Bois, p. 421. Paris, 1767-
     The author prepares us for his own experiments and calcula
  tions by observing, " that Galileo is much nearer, if not exactly
  conformable to the actual operation." But without giving a rea
  son for this opinion, he gives a rule founded on experiments
  which are not detailed, and it is probable the rule will require
  to be varied to suit different kinds of materials, though the only
 variables that ought to have place in it, viz. the direct cohesion
  and extensibility, are both included.    The author must be aware
  that a rule of this kind, however correctly it may agree with
  one set of experiments, will not agree with another ; therefore,
  such a rule must be empirical.       Besides, if it be necessary to
 resort to a rule of this kind, it ought to be simple; which cannot
  be said of the present one.       Several rules have been given at
  different times  from the  experiments of Buffon, and a very easy
  one is given in Brewster's Encyclopaedia, art. Carpentry, p. 508;
  but were these rules correct for timber newly cut, they would be
  incorrect for dry timber.      To attempt to include accidental
  qualities in a general rule is absurd, yet this must always be the
  case with rules founded on experiment.
     The author remarks, that the deflexion " is not a necessary
 datum in estimating the strength of timber for any practical
 purposes of building." Had he said, it is the only one that is really
 useful, he would have been much nearer the truth.            See Dr,
 Young's Nat. Philosophy, vol. i. p. 138; or his paper on Sep-
 ping's Method of Ship-building, Phil. Trans.; or Buchanan's
 Essay on the Shafts of Mills, p. 73.
     If we had a correct theory, as far as the direct cohesion and
 extensibility of the material are concerned, and four or five ex
 periments, under different circumstances, on each kind of ma
 terial, the material being accurately described, its specific gravity
 and extensibility correctly ascertained, and the manner of making
 the experiment accurately detailed, — then we should have a series
of results under various circumstances, which would enable the
 mechanic to apply the theory to practice, with such limitations
as a comparison of his material with that of the experiment
 would readily point out to him.
     As long as the practice of giving mean results without de
tailing the experiments shall continue, so long may we expect
to remain ignorant of the nature of the resistance of solids. In
stead of following the methods of Prony or Laplace, the example
of the chemical writers ought to be followed.       This will lead us
insensibly to perfection, while that is but a specious covering for
ignorance.                                                       I do

   I do not mean to sav, there are no cases where the theory of
Laplace can be applied with advantage: but they are very rare;
and it ought only to be resorted to when there is not the means
of obtaining correct information.

                names are undersigned, being persons who com
posed   the  meeting held at the Assembly-rooms,       Newcastle, on
 the 9th of September 1815, observing that Mr. Ryan has af
fixed the resolution of that meeting, with our signatures, to his
"  Letter to the late Secretary of the Society of Arts, on his Method
of ventilating Coal-mines," feel ourselves called upon to declare,
that no part of that method was then explained to us, but simply
an application of the inverted siphon to the clearing away of
collections of carburetted hydrogen gas, which may have accu
mulated in cavities in the higher levels of a coal-mine ; which
he illustrated by the common experiment of a bended glass tube
immersed in two fluids of different densities.
   In consequence, however, of this general explanation of Mr. -
Ryan's principle, — the particular application of which, at the same
time, he expressly declined communicating, — we thought it right
to give our testimony of general approbation of     it," as consistent
with the principles of philosophy;" and, in consequence of his
assurances of its successful application in certain coal-mines in
Staffordshire, " recommended the propriety of its adoption to
be taken into consideration    by   persons interested in the coal
mines."
   On the merit or demerit of the plan now pointed out            Mr.
                                                                 by
Ryan, we do not feel ourselves called to give an opinion.         Our
only object is  to state, that no communication of        itwas made
to us at the meeting above alluded to.

only aimed at showing that his system is
                                                   " consistent with the
principles of philosophy," and that it is

    We are confident that the gentlemen who signed the above

to add these remarks ; for, having the honour to know some of
them personally, we know that none can more earnestly desire
to see any practicable system introduced which can contribute
to the health or safety of the miners.         Mr. Ryan, being almost
self-taught, is by no means perspicuous in conveying his ideas;
 and without bestowing much personal trouble in attending his
 examinations at the Society of Arts, besides several other meet

 compr. bended it.      We  are  therefore   not surprised that others,
 without the same means, should find         itdifficult. — But this very

                             To   Mr. Tilhch.
 Sm,   —   In  the last number of your valuable Magazine,          a   is
 communication     from Mr. Groombridge,        respecting the late
 eclipse of the sun.   In another Journal (the Monthly Magazine)
 is a communication from Mr. Evans, relative to the same subject.
 On comparing the times, as observed             by
                                            these two gentlemen,            it
 will be seen that there      difference of fourteen seconds in the
                             is
                             a
 time of the commencement, and of twenty -eight seconds in the
 time of the ending of this eclipse.     As these two observers live
 within  a mile or two of each other, there cannot be any great
 difference in the absolute time at the two places: and as they
 have thought proper to publish the result of their observations,
                                                                  I   think

                         On the late Solar Eclipse.                 44 1
I think they owe it to the puhlic to reconcile this singular dif
ference between them.
    The same remark will apply to two other observers in the
town of Ipswich, viz. Mr. Capel Lofft, and Mr. Acton, as in
serted in the same Magazine to which I have just referred.
Here we find a difference of no less than one minute and a
quarter in the time of the ending of this eclipse, although they
both agree as to the time of the commencement.                This dif
ference appears to be there attributed to the superior power of
one of the telescopes: a very improbable and a very absurd so
lution of the difficulty.       For, independent of the impossibility
of any telescope (however powerful) making so wonderful a dif
ference in the ending of this eclipse, it ought to have caused a
similar difference in the time of the commencement.          Indeed we
 sometimes find that there does exist a slight difference in the
observed time of the commencement of an eclipse, but seldom
any difference in the time of the ending of it: because in the
former case, one observer may catch the first impression of the
moon on the sun's disc before the other ; but, in the latter case,
they can both follow the moon's course to the very edge of the
sun's disc, with equal facility and correctness, and thereby tell
exactly the time at which the separation of the two bodies takes
 place.
     Before 1 close this letter, I cannot help adverting to Mr.
 Groombridge's explanation of the error in the Nautical Alma
 nac, which had been noticed in one of your former numbers,
 relative to the point where the moon makes the first impression
 on the sun's disc, in this eclipse.       He says that the number of
 degrees    is right  if  applied  to the moon's vertex as it relates to
 the plane of the equator, and that it ought to have been so
 expressed.      But surely it cannot be necessary to inform Mr.
 Groombridge that in all cases of this kind, the angle is reckoned
 from the vertex as referring to the plane of the horizon only;
 and that the very design of noticing it in the Nautical Almanac,
 was to enable an observer to point his telescope to that part of
 the sun's disc : which could not be done if the vertex related to
 the plane of the ecliptic or of the equator.      In fact, Mr. Groom-
 bridge    cannot    produce any    Nautical Almanac, ever since the
 first publication of that work, wherein any other interpretation
 of the phrase is intended : neither do I think that he can men
 tion any treatise on the science, whereiu any other mode is given,
 for determining the point where the moon first touches the sun's
  disc, than that which measures the angle from the vertex as it
  relates to the plane of the horizon.
     One word more on the subject of this eclipse.          Mr. Groom-
 bridge observes that it was total in the northern parts of Russia,
                                                                       on

 on or near the meridian.           But, if he will take the trouble to
 calculate the path of the moon's shadow, he will find that the
 sun was centrally eclipsed on the meridian in north latitude 43°

 the moon's shadow did not, at any time during its whole course,

                                 To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Dear Sir, —     The        following observation on the solar eclipse,
 of November 19, 1816, was taken in latitude 52° 45' 24" M.
 and longitude 1' 34",4 in time, east of Greenwich.
    The beginning of the eclipse was not observed, but the end
was taken, with a forty-six inch achromatic magnifying forty-
two times, at          . .          . .    10* 25' 14",5 A.M. per clock.

      End of the eclipse           . .     10 22     4,84 m. time.
    The air was very clear during the time of observation, and the
aperture of the object glass of the telescope being contracted to
two inches, the distinctness gained by this means was more than
a compensation for the low power I used. And, as I had an ob
servation of the sun's transit over the meridian on the same day,
the error of observation of the end of the eclipse does not, pro-
hably,   amount to more than a second.
                     I. am,     dear sir,
                                        Yours respectfully,

XCI.     Inquiries into the Laws of Dilatation of Solids,              Li
   quids, and elastic Fluids, and on the exact Measurement of
   Temperatures.         By Messrs. Dulong and Petit.              Read to
   the Institute 29lh of May 1816 .
                           [Concluded     from p. 380.]
        Of the Dilatation of Solids            at high Temperatures.
The     knowledge of the dilatation of the metals, particularly of
the ductile metals employed in the construction of instruments
                                                                      and

and elastic Fluids, and on the Measurement     of Temperatures, 443
and machines, is very important in a great number of circum
stances. The utility of these determinations has been at all times
felt; and they have employed methods more and more exact, in
proportion as the want of precision was felt in physical researches.
We may cite as most deserving of confidence the results of
Smeaton, Ramsden, Lavoisier, and Laplace.
    In the labours which have been undertaken on this subject,
we have principally endeavoured to ascertain the absolute dila
tations from 0° to 100', and this is in fact sufficient for common
use. Messrs. Laplace and Lavoisier have besides ascertained,
that between the freezing and boiling point the dilatation of the
metals was exactly in proportion to the indication of the mer
curial thermometer.        Borda also made the same comparison,
but in an extent of thermometrical scale too inconsiderable to
warrant any induction relative to the laws of dilatation.    Never
theless the object of his labour was fulfilled, since he proposed
merely to ascertain the variations of length which were produced
by the changes of temperature of the air in the instruments
which were to be employed in the measurement of the meri
dian.
   The greatest difficulty experienced by all those who have been
occupied with inquiries into the dilatation of solids, proceeds'
from the necessity in which we are of rendering one part of the
system absolutely fixed, which implies much complication          in
 the apparatus.      When we confine ourselves, as Borda did, to
 measure the difference of dilatation of two metals, we are merely
obliged to render the instruments invariable with respect to each
other, a condition which it is much more easy to perform than
the first.
    As we only seek , to compare between each other the laws of
dilatation of various bodies, it appeared to us that we should
equally well attain this end, by substituting the difference of the
dilatations for the absolute dilatations.
    It is chiefly from this consideration that we determined to em
ploy the following apparatus :
    This apparatus is composed of two rods, one of platina, the
other of red copper, twelve decimetres long, twenty-five milli
metres broad, and four millimetres thick: they are connected in
an invariable manner by one of their extremities, by means of
an iron traverse upon which they are firmly screwed.          To the
 other extremity are adapted brass rods, which rise at first verti
cally and afterwards bend horizontally.        One of these rods has
a scale graduated into fifths of a millimetre,      and the other is
furnished with an index which marks the twentieths of the di
vision of the scales, which admits of our appreciating the cen-
                                                              tiemes

  444    Inquiries info the Laws of Dilatation    of Solids, Liquids,
  tiemes of the millimetre      or the 120,000dth parts of the length
  of the measuring rods.
     These   rods rest on four copper rollers fastened to a bar of
 iron.    The whole machinery       is placed in a vessel of red copper
 fourteen decimetres long, fifteen centimetres deep, and ten cen
  timetres broad.      We made use of fixed oil in these new experi
 ments as in those which were made upon the gases, and we had
 recourse to the same means to render the temperature stationary
 during a time sufficient to permit the measuring rods to acquire
 an equilibrium of temperature with the liquid.         There were also
 two systems of metallic plates placed on each side of the mea
 suring rods, and which we might put in motion in the liquid
 mass, so as to mix the different strata, and establish everywhere
 a'uniform temperature without any risk of the derangement of
 the rods.     Finally, the copper vessel was furnished with a lid
 having   four  sockets, in which were thermometers which served
 to indicate the differences of temperature which were expected
 to take place in the various parts of the vessel.       A thermometer
 placed horizontally between the bars indicated the true tempera
 ture of the liquid.
     That we may avoid prolixity, we shall omit several trifling de
 tails, which concurred however to the exactitude of our observa
tions.     It is easy to see from the known dilatations of the platina
 and copper, that a change of one degree in temperature ought
 to vary the relative position of the index by about a hundredth
 of a millimetre. Now it is impossible to be deceived with a part
of the index, however little a person may be versed in reading
off the divisions.     This precision appeared to us sufficient in the
kind of researches which occupy us. Besides, in order to give
 more sensibility to this instrument, its dimensions must be aug
mented, and then the difficulty of establishing a uniform tem
perature throughout the whole extent of the measuring rods
would necessarily throw more uncertainty on the true dilata
tions.
     As a point of departure, we have taken the state of the mea-
6uriug rods in an oil-bath, which remained several days in a
room the temperature of which did not sensibly vary.               This
process appeared      to us  to  be preferable to the employment of
ice, which does not present a temperature really fixed, unless we
can agitate it continually, particularly when the surrounding air
is from 15° to 20° above zero.
    The oil -bath was afterwards heated to the temperature of 100
degrees and upwards, with the same precautions as in the foregoing
experiments.       The heat of the liquid mass and that of the fur
nace being here very considerable, the maximum of temperature
                                                                    WHS

end elast ic   Fluids, and   on the Measuremen t   of Tempera t itres .445
was   kept up for ten or twelve minutes, which was sufficient for
the rods being put in equilibrium of temperature with the oil, if
we consider particularly that the agitation of the liquid renewed
every instant the surfaces in contact.   (The proof of this was
besides acquired by the invariability of the indications of the in
dex.)
     The temperature was afterwards raised to 200, 250, 300°,
and the simultaneous observation of the index and of the mer
curial thermometer served for comparing the progress of this
last instrument with the dilatation of the metals.         On taking
the difference of dilatation corresponding nearly to the first .hun
dred degrees of increment in the temperature, in order to ascer
tain the value of the degree in our metallic thermometer, we
 found that the term of 300° of the mercurial thermometer cor
responded nearly with 310° of the metallic thermometer.         These
experiments, which were repeated several times with results very
little different, prove, contrary to the opinion generally received,
that the metals follow in their dilatation a progress more rapid
than that of the mercurial thermometer.           Thus by supposing
that we had regulated, according to the method adopted, the
thermometer in the air, the mercurial thermometer, and the me
tallic thermometer, when the first shall mark 300° on its scale,
the second will indicate nearly 310°, and the third 320°.
    This property of the metals being once well ascertained, we
must naturally inquire if the glass, which we are obliged to em
ploy in almost all the experiments, does not present the same
phenomenon.         We endeavoured to ascertain this by adding a
measuring rod of glass to the copper measuring rod of the fore
going apparatus ; but a difficulty was then presented, which we
do not meet with in the metals ; the measuring rods ought to be
kept in a position absolute!" invariable with respect to each
other, and this cannot be done without a screw. Now all the
world knows that it is impossible to fasten strongly a thick me
tallic plate against the glass without breaking        it,
                                                        whatever care        •
be taken to prepare the surfaces which are to come in contact.
We employed in the first place, as an intermediate body, a sheet
of paper which had been previously brought to temperature of
                                                       a
300°    by taking care to compress   it strongly between two metallic
plates.     In spite of this precaution, the glass rod did not appear
fixed with sufficient solidity after the experiment, to remove every
suspicion of error.     We then substituted for the paper very thin
laminae of fine silver ;   and for this time the immoveability of the
measuring     rod  and of its prolongation appeared to us complete.
    We have made with this system of measuring rods several
series of experiments similar to the foregoing, and we found
                                                                  that

 that the excess of the dilatation of the copper over that of the
 glass remained very nearlv in proportion to the indications of
 the mercurial thermometer to the temperature of 300° and up
 wards.     This result, very different from that which we had ob
 tained with the measurements of copper and pi a tin a, as it ap
 peared to us, could only be accounted for by supposing the glass
 to possess a law of dilatation still more rapid than that of the
 metals.
    Before us, M. De Luc thought he perceived in this substance a
 similar property, although his experiments had not gone beyond
  lOO^.    His apparatus was composed of two vertical measuring
 rods, one of glass and the other of brass, fastened together in
 variably at their lower extremities.      He gave to these measuring
 rods lengths which are in the inverse ratio to their respective
 dilatability : the largest, which was the glass one, is kept fastened
 by its upper part ; the highest extremity of the copper rod i»
 entirely free ; and it results from the relation of the dimensions
 of the two measuring rods, that this extremity cannot undergo
 any' change of situation at whatever temperature the measuring
 rods are exposed, if the dilatabilities of the "glass and of the
 copper vary in proportion.          Now De Luc had observed that
 when he had established the compensation for a certain change
 of temperature, there was, no longer any room for greater or
                                            ' .
smaller variations.
    But we must observe, that the measuring rods were in a ver-*
 tical situation, and plunged into a vessel full of water, of which
 the temperature was gradually raised.         Although care was taken
to shake the liquid, it is probable that the inferior strata were
 always colder than the upper; and as the copper rod occupied
 the lower half, while that of glass passed through it in its whole
height, we may ascribe the increasing dilatability which the glass
has presented, to the copper rod being always found at a lower
temperature than the other, and the difference must have in
creased with the heating.        We might besides remove this doubt,
by repeating     the  same    observation,   the measuring rods being
placed horizontally,      or  rather  by reversing the position of the
apparatus .
    M. De Luc, who does not seem to suppose that his apparatus
has the inconvenience we have mentioned, employed no means
of verification ; so that we might fairly entertain some well founded
doubts as to the result of his experiments.           With the view of
verifying the consequences which we may deduce from the ob
servations of this experimentalist and our own, we have endea
voured to establish this same comparison by a more simple me

    The march of the mercury in the ordinary thermometer mea
sures the excess of the dilatation of this liquid over that of the
substance which serves it for an envelope : when this substance
raries, the apparent dilatations of the mercury change ; but they
will all follow the same law, if the bodies of which the envelopes
are formed have themselves a similar law of dilatation.              M.Biot
has already made a fortunate application of this truth to the de»
termination of the real maximum of density of water, and to the
inquiry into the laws of dilatation of various liquids.
     It was by resting on the same principle that we endeavoured
to compare       the dilatations of the glass and iron at various tem
peratures.       In order to know the apparent dilatation of the
mercury in the glass, it is sufficient to observe the thermometer
itself t in order to measure this same dilatation in the iron, it is
sufficient to construct a thermometer the reservoir and tube of
which are of iron. We cannot, it is true, estimate directly in
thii case the increase of volume ; but by substituting the mea
 surement of the weights for that of the volumes, the determina*
tions are not less exact, when we operate on a large mass.
     The instrument which we made use of consisted of a cylin
drical reservoir of hammered iron, very homogeneous, which
 might contain about 135 grammes of mercury.               It is surmounted
by a cone taken          in  the same   mass,  and  terminated    by a small
 hollow steel tube, the interior diameter of which does not exceed
 a demi-millimetre.         We may screw to the upper part of this tube
 another reservoir of the same metal, the capacity of which is
 double that of the lower : when the two pieces are joined, the
 extremity of the tube enters two or three millimetres into the in
 terior of this cylinder.        We see by this arrangement that we
 mav    fill the  reservoir   and   the tube like a thermometer, by boil
ing at different times the mercury, so as to avoid all suspicion of
 the air or humidity having any effect.
     When the vessel has assumed the desired temperature, we un
 screw the upper reservoir, and the lower will be found perfectly
 filled with mercury.          On submitting it afterwards to a higher
 temperature,       the  mercury which issues from the thermometer
 of iron may      be  received   into the upper reservoir.      By weighing
 precisely the empty vessel, and this same vessel containing the
 mass of mercury which filled its capacity at the different tem
 peratures observed, we may see by a very simple calculation,
 if the supposition of a similar law of dilatation in the iron and
 the glass will make the results of the experiments agree with each
 Other. ,

 dred thennometrical degrees a very sensible variation hi the ratio
 of the dilatations of the two substances which we compared ;
                                                                         but

  448        Inquiries into  the  Laws of Dilatation   of Solids,
   but we made the experiment at the boiling point of water, in
   order to assure ourselves of the degree of exactness which we
   might expect from our process. By employing in the calculation
   the dilatation of iron given by Messrs. Laplace and Lavoisier,
   we found the dilatation of the mercury TTVr f°r one degree.
   We must add an unit to the third cypher significative            of the
   dilatation of the iron which we have employed, in order to make
  lour result coincide exactly with that of the same experimentalists
   on the expansion of mercury.
      Now by exposing the vessel at the temperature of 3003 we
   find that the quantity of mercury which issues from the iron
   thermometer is far superior to that which ought to issue from it,
  if the iron and the glass preserved at high temperatures the
   ratio of expansibility which has been assigned to them below
    100°. — This experiment has been repeated several times, with
   results very little different ; so that we may conclude that the
   dilatation of the glass does not remain constant at all tempera
   tures, and that it increases more rapidly than that of iron. '
       It is extremely probable that the dilatation on the increment
   of elastic  force of the gases remains constantly proportional to the
   temperatures.      (This is what we shall prove in a subsequent pa
  per.)      By admitting this principle, we see that the indications
  of the mercurial thermometer will be always superior to the real
   temperatures, and the more so in proportion as we rise in the
  scale; but experimentalists will doubtless see with astonishment,
  the slowness with which these differences increase.          This does
  not seem to arise from the dilatations of the mercury remaining
  nearly proportional to the real increments of temperature, but
  from the law of dilatation of the glass being combined with that
  of the mercury, and an almost exact compensation being the re-
-suit.      Besides, we shall be able to verify this completely.
      It results also from our researches, that the metallic pyro
  meters, to which we ascribe a regular march, indicate tempera
  tures much too high, when we suppose, as has always been done
 hitherto, that the dilatation of the metals remains constantly pro
  portional to the temperatures.

     XC1I. New Theorems applicable                         to the     Value of Annuities.
                                         To   Mr. Tilloch.
    Sir, —   The following correct and new theorems, for deter
    mining in all cases the amounts of annuities certain when in
    creasing in the constant ratio of the natural numbers 1.2.3.. . .n,
    and also of the squares and cubes of the natural numbers, may
    prove acceptable to many of your readers.
       The method of summing of series of this kind is very Well
    known, but in this instance 1 was led to them by a process es
    sentially different. However, mv object is not to discuss frfethods
    and principles, but to detect error with a view to the consequent
    establishment of truth ; and as this matter appears not to have
    been clearly illustrated by any of the writers on series or an-
•
    nuities with whom I am acquainted, I am therefore desirous to
    announce these theorems in vour publication.         Mr. Baity, in his
    Doctrine of Annuities, has given the investigations relating to
    this subject ; but in the several series there made to represent,
    respectively, the amount of these annuities, a remarkable incon
    sistency exists, the consequence of which                         is,
                                                      that the formulae,
    thence derived, are of no avail in satisfying the objects of our
    inquiry when the annuities are thus annually increasing            and                  ;
    further, that they are applicable to this purpose, only on the as
    sumption of the annuities being actually decreasing in the order
    specified above.          therefore proper that the two assumptions
                               It   is
    be separately distinguished, and this ambiguity in the formulas
    pointed out: otherwise the adoption of         indiscriminately, may
                                                                 it
    not only confuse and mislead, but produce egregious mistakes.
    At the same time,       cannot but express my surprise that an au
                               I
    thor, who censures with so much freedom and severity the scien
    tific labours of his contemporaries, should have suffered such
    absurdities to deteriorate what in every other respect            very            is   a
    useful and popular performance.
     I    shall now proceed to give the theorems themselves       in order           ;

XCJII.      On Safety-lamps, and the Barrier formed by IVire-
  gauze against the Passage of Flame.         lhj J. Murray, Esq.
                             To Mr. Tillock.
SrR,   — ]Vf r. Langmire,        in the last number of The Annals of
 Philosophy, pronounces the limit I have assigned to the harrier
against flame — to be inconsistent with the deductions of Sir
 H. Davy. By a reference to my paper Mr. L. will find that
 this had a relation to simple unexplosive flame, and was intro
 duced as explanatory of the chasm obtaining between flame
and metallic surfaces; and if this gentleman will have the good
 ness to place a series of wires on a frame, tliese wires being one-
'eighth of an inch apart, he will find (as I did) that such an ar
rangement is effectual in cutting pff the communication of flame.
 If he will please to be referred to the Rev. Mr. Hodson's Narrative
in your last number, page 351, he will also discover that Sir H.
expressly names one-eighth ; this I hail as corroborating my
 inference, -and value it the more as it has been for the first time
 to me published. — The safety-lamps are constructed of wire-
 gauze having 784 apertures in the square inch; and 1 repeat,
 that I do not consider any danger is to be apprehended, if by
 accident the alternate mesh be broken down ; for even then, the
 intervals would be only distanced one-fourteenth, of an inch.
    The double cylinder is by no means necessary, and may be in-,
jurious where the exterior      one   is of copper, for the following
 reasons  :
     1. It is violently acted upon by fire-damp.                    . .
    2. Dissimilar nietals, being employed, a Galvanic action may
lie induced, and corrosion take place. And,
    3. The sebacic aeid of rancid oil acts forcibly on copper.
    I will go further than even Sir H. Davy has done, and assert,
 that, even should an explosion occur within the lamp (the gauze
being formed of loose pliant materials), and the imperfectly con
 structed cvlinder hirst, by means of it; even then, no danger
 would accrue to the miners, for the extinction would instantly
 succeed the explosion, when confined within the cylinder.          In
 one of the collieries which I descended, the under-vievvers using
 a lamp procured from Newcastle, made of fiue-hrass wire as soft
 and pliant almost as common thin writing-paper, the cylinder
 loosely connected with the socket, ahove the screw, and the
 seam indifferently joined ; — this improper instrument, having
 nothing to recommend it but a rude imitation of that most valu
 able machine, hurst in his hands at the joining of the seam ; yet
 he was perfectly  ' ' secure, and escaped   without the least injurv,
                                   Ff2                            Tlifi

452            On Safety-lamps, and the      Barrier formed
The seam was stitched together with intervals not less than |th
of an inch ; and this had served repeatedly to explore the mine
and ascertain the presence of the fire-damp.             These facts are
important to our question, and place it in a new and interesting
point of regard.
     It is harsh and unbecoming,      I deem, sir, to ridicule this happy
invention ; for myself, 1 cannot make merry when the question
at issue is that of the lives of human beings : — Is it not too
 severe to blend the name of its discoverer with contemptuous
sarcasm ? — introduce the language of the admirers of this prin
ciple of security with pantomimic farce ? — and to turn the praise
honestly bestowed on Sir H. Davy, into invectives against him?
 I should be glad to know who it is that has done more for che
 mical science than this philosopher (I would not depreciate the
 labours of his contemporaries, or undervalue preceding chemists):
 What discovery, I ask, has ever imposed a higher claim than
 this safe-lamp, on our tribute of admiration ?            Mr. Lang-mire
 suspects   it  is unsafe—  1, on the   other hand,   know  that it is se
 cure under everv possible circumstance.          This language Mr. L.
 will pronounce bold and assuming; — but it has been proved safe
 under circumstances which can never occur in the mine. — A
 friend of mine got a small safe-lamp, not more than one half
 the size of those in common use, and where the danger was pro
 portionally enhanced, this, containing 784 apertures in the
 square inch, was plunged into a mixture of oxygen and super -
 carluretted hydrogen: the wire-gauze became speedily red hot;
 but it was found even under this severe test perfectly safe.          Sir
 Humphry Davy         is blamed,  I  think  unfairly,  for the  mere  me-
 chunical part of the structure ; and the term " lamp making,"
 and the word " original," are associated in a manner which is
 unfeeling and undeserved. The calm and dispassionate suffrages
 of the gentlemen who voted to Sir H. a piece of plate, for the
 eminent service rendered to the cause of miners, forcibly re
 pel the unjust attack.       Would it not be an insult to their un
 derstanding and good sense. to say that the merits of the dis
 covery had not been fully canvassed, or that they were incapable
 of appreciating the benefits rendered to humanity by its means?
 1 challenge in the most unequivocal manner Mr. L. to point out
 a single accident which has occurred where Sir H. Davy's lamp,
 as constructed by Mr. Newman, of Lisle-street, has been used.
 This is the most decisive appeal that I can make, or can be made,
 in its favour, — I think I could guaranty with my life its abso
 lute safety. The wear of the materials is a point which none can
 prevent — mutability is impressed upon all the works of Nature.
 To defy or controul the operations of natural causes, to endea
 vour to stem the ravages of time, is a folly which could never

  enter a mind so well fortified by science as that of the emi
 nent philosopher against whom Mr. Langmire has so desperately
 wielded the shaft of ridicule. — As to the priority of Sir H.
 accused by Mr. L. {indirectly it may be) of acting on the ori
 ginal invention of another, Mr. Hodson's view of the controversy
 will fully confirm : and to that paper I beg that Mr. Langmire
 will direct his attention.
     None can doubt Mr. Langmire's scientific merits. His various:
 papers bear ample testimony of a shrewd and well-informed
 mind; and the honourable assurancesof his practical knowledge in
 mines, which I had the happiness to receive from many gentlemen
 respectable for their attainments, render the position unques
 tionable.     Mr. Children's scientific worth stands pre-eminent in
 the lists of human knowledge, and is universally acknowledged.
     It is painful to see the asperities of controversy, and particu
larly those of superior minds.        In the warmth of our feelings,
excited by an ardent love of what we esteem and value and ad
 mire, inadvertent expressions escape, which our cool and calmer
moments of reflection condemn, and wish to recall.          For myself,
 I own I felt hurt when the admirers of this discovery were told
that they w«re amused with the ** novelty of the thing," as if
we were children, and the object of our admiration a Dutch toy ;
and now we are informed that it maybe esteemed as a "curiosity."
A little while, and the balance of truth, directed by the hand of
time, will incline the scale, and pronounce a verdict in favour of
the absolute security of Sir H. Davy's safe-lamp, which the
storms of opposition can never disturb, and which will stand un
shaken iu " proud pre-eminence."
    In proof of the explanation offered by me, for the principle on
which hinges the offered security, — and that it does not depend
on the conducting character of the metallic wire-gauze, — I may
state again, that non-conductors of caloric will cut off the com
munication of flame. This may be easily proved : — Let a number
of punctures be made in a card, and propel a jet of carburetted
hydrogen through it ; the experiment will decide that the gas
may be ignited on the outer surface of the card, and cut off the
flame from communicating with the orifice of the pipe.
    Besides all this, the ambient air is a bad conductor of heat.
    I have insulated a flame surrounded by an atmosphere of
steam, and found that combustion would not communicate
through it.
    Methinks it is cruel to torture the miner's peace by raising
Suspicions as to the security of the safety-lamp: — for my own part,
                                                                        •

benefits to mankind; .            ...  .

      I had imagined that this lamp would have held precedence df
all others, and that there existed no necessity of making a pa
rade ahout any other, or raising up a rival. I see, however, that
Dr. Murray's safe^lamp forms a prominent article in the last
number of Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy: — whether the
merit of priority rests with Dr. Murray or with me, let the fol
lowing extract from the little volume I published, and quoted by
 Mr. Hudson, decide : see page 154.
  .
       " An air-tight lamp being formed — a pipe might supply it
 from the mine itself,. the orifice of the tube receiving the supply
 from the stratum of air contiguous to the floor, — the carburetted
 hydrogen being lighter and ascending would occupy the upper
  part, and thus could not enter the tube."
      . This is conclusive on the subject, — My Elements of Chemical
  Science was published June 1815, consequentlyjzi'e months be
  fore Dr. Murray's paper on the subject appeared and was read
  before the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Whatever merit then may
  attach to priority in suggesting the structure of an air-tight
  lamp, to be fed by a flexible tube from the floor of the minex
  founded on the specific levity of the ascending carburetted hy
  drogen,      I must claim as my undisputed right. But really, sir, I
  see no use in multiplying safety-lamps, which cannot in their
   " best estate" compete for a moment with the one introduced
  by Sir H. Davy: by this
                               " sublimely simple" invention, these im
   perfect projections are happily superseded ; and for my own part,
   I should have consigned the suggestion of my mind to forgetful-
   ness, had it not been elicited from me by Dr. M.'s persisting in
   claiming an exclusive title to this structure ; and but for this, my
   present statement would have never been.           I may again detail
   to you my plans for getting rid of the fire and choke damps of
    mines, which has been honoured with two votes of thanks from
    " the Society for preventing Accidents in Coal-mines." — That
    of the fire-damp will require a plate for its better apprehension.
         If my feeble labours in the cause of humanity should be di
    rectly or indirectly serviceable, it will delight me to reflect, that
    at least part of the duties of social and civil life has been fuL-
    filled in me.

     December 5. — Mr. Todd, through the hands of Sir Everard
 Horrre, .communicated the result of some additional experiments,
 made on Torpedoes at La Rochelle. The subjects he now ope
 rated on were one 8 and the other 1 8 inches long, but they de
 veloped no new facts.      He found the shocks greater, as might be
 expected, by improving the conductors, in applying the one hand
                                                                  to

in contact with the electric organs. The organs, it appears, pro
ceed from the medulla oblongata.
     Mr. Hatchett communicated a process for sweetening musty
corn, in a letter to Sir Joseph Banks.            Several years ago this
philosopher Was engaged          in researches into the quality and pro
ducts of wheat and barley, in consequence of whichhe discovered
that musty grain, which was so bitter as to be totally unfit for
use, and which could scarcely be ground, might be rendered per
fectly sweet and sound by simply immersing it in boiling water
and letting it remain till the water became cold.           The quantity
of water    in this case  was  always double that of the corn to be pu
rified.     Mr. H. found that the musty quality rarely' penetrated
through the husk of the wheat, and that in the very worst cases
 it did not extend through the amylaceous matter which lies im
mediately under the skin.           In the hot water all the decayed or
 rotten grain     swims  on  the  surface, so that the remaining wheat is
effectually cleaned from all impurities, and this too without any
material loss. The wheat is afterwards to be dried, stirring it oc
 casionally on the kiln, when it will be found improved to an ex
 tent which can scarcely be believed without actual experience*-
 The immense quantities of musty corn now in merchants' ware
 houses or granaries belonging to farmers, render these experi
 ments highly valuable at the present crisis ; and it is not doubted
 that, whatever may be the cavils of ignorance and inhumanity,
 the good sense of all those interested will lead them to adopt so
 easy, cheap, and effectual means of rendering their wheat or other
 grain from 10*. to 40*. a quarter more valuable.
     Dec. 12. — The President, happily, was again able to resume
 his chair, and Mr. Braude read a paper containing the results of
 his experiments on a species of Chinese galls, which were given
 to him by Sir Joseph Banks to analyse.             It appears that these
 galls  are very valuable  for dyeing,  or making ink, and that the Chi
 nese   use  them   for their  black  dyes ; they yielded 75 per cent, of
 the astringent principle, containing oxalic and gallic acid, but no
 extractive matter.       The residuum was chiefly woody fibre.        As
 these gal's contain no extractive matter, they are consequently
 unfit for tanning, and in this respect they differ from all other
 Stalls, or even from catechu.
   , Dec. 19.: — The .President in the Chair.         M. Du Pin, through
 the hands of Dr. Young, communicated some remarks on naval
 architecture, and particularly on the improvements adopted by Mr.
 Seppings. This author began by numerous professions ofgratitude
for the civilities which he received during his visit to this country,
and expressed a wish that the paper theikijead should be consi
 dered as a testimony of that feeling.          But science has neither
                                                                 passions

passions nor country, and the language of adulation or of preju
dice is fortunately unknown in the apartments of the Royal So
ciety. M. Du Pin then proceeded by claiming to his countryman,
a French shipbuilder, all the merits of Mr. Seppings' improve
ments, which he alleged were known in France in 17^5 ; he intro
duced some mathematical calculations, which were of a nature not
to be publicly read ; and added some remarks on the nature of a
ship's arching, or, as our seamen call   it, hogging; alleging that
vessels always arch most just on being launched, and before re
ceiving their guns or cargoes that their arching augments their

ticalmenwill treat as mere theoretical dreams, unsupported        the

evidence of facts and experience.
    With respect to the origin of the improvements made          Mr.
                                                                   by
Seppings,  it   isprobable that this ingenious mechanician will call
for some more substantial evidence, than that of mere assertion.
 In his first paper which was read to the Royal Society, he men
tioned the French vessels which were built on different plan; he
                                                a
 also stated in what his improvements consisted, and how materi
 ally they differed from any preceding attempts.       He did not in
 deed pretend that transverse timbers were never before employed.
A   vessel with vertical planks and horizontal timbers was built at
 Archangel in the latter end of the 17th century.     Butit   among
                                                              is
 the Spaniards and Venetians that we are to look for the earliest
 and best attempts in naval architecture. The former have always
 built excellent ships, and near two centuries ago tried the effect
 of diagonal planks, &c. Hence we may find that all which Mr. S.
 has adopted from others, was common property in Europe even
 before the period of 1725.
                         ROYAL ACADEMY.
   Tuesday, Dee. 10, being the forty-ninth anniversary of the In
stitution of the Royal Academy of Arts, a General Assembly of the
Academicians was held at their apartments in Somerset-House,
where the following distribution of Premiums took place, viz.
    To Mr. Edward Elton, for the best Copy made in the School
of Painting, the Silver Medal, and the Lectures of Barry, Opie,
and Fuseli, handsomely bound and inscribed.
    To Mr. Richard Carruthers, for the next best Copy made                in
the School of Painting, the Silver Medal.

                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,. — Amon<i the numerous mixtures which are attended
with a diminution of sensible heat, a very convenient and effec
tive one seems to have hitherto escaped the attention of che
mists. It is that of snow and alcohol. The greatest effect appears
 to take place when equal weights of each are used, and I need
scarcely add, that the precaution of effecting the solution in the
least possible time is necessary to produce the maximum of cold.
    The temperature both of the snow and alcohol being 32°, the
solution in several experiments fell to —17°, amounting to
495 of Fahrenheit.        The alcohol was not of a very low specific
gravity,  so that   I  imagine it would not be difficult to produce at
least an additional degree.         The original communication not
having reached you, and no memorandum having been preserved,
I cannot now state what its strength was, nor does the season as
yet admit of a repetition of the experiment; since the difference
in the solubility of pounded ice and of snow will sensibly affect
the results.
    You will perceive that this circumstance explains the greater
degree of cold generated by mixing snow with our strong, wines^
than by plunging the containing vessel into ice and water.
                  I   am, sir, Your obedient servant,

        Prehnite. — Steam Engines. — Nautical Ephemeris.           461
           PREHNITE DISCOVERED IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE.
     Mr. Bakewell has recently discovered Prenhite in a rock of
 Basaltic Amygdalin at Woodford Bridge, near Berkley in Glou
cestershire.      This mineral has not, we believe, been found before
in any part of England or Wales, though it occurs in Scotland and
various parts of the world. The Basaltic Amygdalin of Wood
ford Bridge contains also decomposing agates, zeolite and green
earth.     It is further remarkable for having in the upper part large
and perfect organic remains of coral, of which Mr. Bakewell
brought away a fine specimen imbedded in basalt.            The occur
rence of marine animal remains in this rock may revive- the long
agitated question respecting the igneous or aqueous formation of
basalt.
                     STEAM ENGINES IN CORNWALL.
     Messrs. Lean, in their report of work done by steam engines
 111 Cornwall, in November, notiee an error in their report for
 October. — For 39,556,496, the work done by Mr. Woolf's en
 gine at Wheal Vor in October, read 40,920,513 pounds lifted
 one foot high with each bushel of coals.
     The counters of some of the engines have been idle in Novem
 ber.    The average work of twenty-six reported was 20,538,498
 pounds with each bushel.         The others reported are;
     Woolf's engine at Wheal Abraham, loaded 1 5* 1 per square
 inch in cylinder, lifted 46,648,718 pounds with each busbel of
 coals. Mis other engine at that mine, loaded 3*1 per inch, lifted
 21,460,944.
     Another engine of his, at Wheal Unity, load 13*8 per inch,
 appears in this report — Work 34,432,825           pounds lifted with
 each bushel,       An old engine at Wheal Abraham, now under the
 management 'of Mr. Woolf, lifted 34,152,162               pounds per

                          NAUTICAL    EPHEMERIS.
     Sir, — It   seems rather extraordinary that, whilst so many are
 fruitlessly  endeavouring    to find errors in our excellent Nautical
  Ephemeris,      no one  should  have noticed the almost entire omis
  sion (for the last two years) of the occultations of the planets or
  fixed stars by the moon.       I am the more surprised at this omis
  sion, as no cause has been assigned for it ; and the notice re
  specting the notation, as well as the exhortation to mariners and
  travellers to observe th^occultations as often as possible, are still
                                                              continued

continued in the general explanation prefixed to the Almanac. At
no time were these observations likely to be of more essential ser
vice than at the present. From the various anomalies which have
occurred in the course of the great Trigonometrical Survey, it ap
pears that the latitudes and longitudes of places, determined as
tronomically, can no longer be considered as accurate expressions
to designate the relative situation of places on the earth. These
anomalies are supposed to arise either from irregularities in the
figure of the earth itself, or from certain irregularities in the den
sity of its strata, causing a deflection of the plumb-line. from the
position it would otherwise assume. In either case a careful com
parison of the latitudes and longitudes of different places deter
mined trigonometrically, with those of the same places derived
from astronomical observations, seems to be the only probable
way of throwing light on this intricate subject, and leading us to
a true knowledge of the earth's figure,
   There is, perhaps, no method of determining the longitude
astronomically with greater accuracy, than from the occultations
of the fixed stars by the moon.       They are also of frequent oc
currence ; and as there are many individuals in this country who
possess the means of making these observations with accuracy,
one would wish that every assistance should be afforded that
 might invite to it. Until our Astronomer Royal shall again -af
ford this, perhaps the insertion in your Magazine of such astro*-                                                                •

     Srtt, —The    new blow- pipe, acting by a stream of condensed
 oxygen and hydrogen, has deservedly excited much interest:
 a detail of some experiments effected by means of this power
 ful instrument may prove interesting.         I am following them up;
 and may merely mention, meantime, that the oxygen was ob
 tained from oxymuriate of potassa, and the hydrogen from zinc,
 &c. The proportions, such as form the constituents of water :
     1. Platinum as thick as a stocking wire was instantly fused,
scintillated, and fell in a large globule.
    2. Palladium fused instantly, and slightly scintillated.
    3. A watch-spring melted with most splendid coruscations,
fused into a large globule, and even boiled violently.
    4. Pure caustic alumina and magnesia burnt with inde
scribable brilliancy, exhibiting a splendour of light rivalled
only by the sun.
    5. Part of a tobacco-pipe burnt vividly, and was fused into
GLASS.
    6. A piece of indigo exhibited a beautiful and intense fame.
    7. A fine electric tourmalin grew red hot, instantly fused,
and flamed. — It did not forgo its electric powers.
    8. The diamond, in a groove pf charcoal, was submitted to
its influence: — In a short time it became red hot, then burst
into flame; and, when dislodged from its nidus, it fell upon the
table, and continued a second or two in actual fame.
    Through Dr. Clarke, the chemist has received an agent of the
most extraordinary powers of ignition.           Anticipation augurs in
"   breathless expectation" the most brilliant results.         Man is
only in the infancy of his being !
                       I am, respectfully, Sir,

    P.S. A     mass of percarburet of iron (plumbago) gave
beautiful   minute    sparks, and was fused.
    Rock    crystal     decrepitated violently. At this moment an ex
plosion of the condensed gases took place, and the instrument
was rendered useless.
    This accident suspends for the present a continuation of the
experiments ; but the chemist must smile at danger when such
brilliant results rise up in prospective.                      J. M.

 ing experiments might be made on the refraction of light through
 media of different densities.
    Besides glass and water and atmospheric air, the rays of light
 might be directed through vessels of varied sizes and shapes, filled
 with alcohol, ether, naphtha, or even the various gaseous sub
 stances, from the heaVy carbonic acid gas to the lightest hy
 drogen.                   .   /
    In these experiments     the rays of light might also be examined
 when separated into their different colours, and thus directed
 through these various media.
    Perhaps these hints may induce some of your correspondents,
 who have the leisure and the conveniencies requisite for the per
 formance of such experiments, to engage their attention to them,
 and communicate the result to the public.           As to myself, I can
 only say  — Fungar   vice   Cotis.                 A  Correspondent.

                    LARGE EUHARMONIC ORGAN.
    Messrs. Flight and Robson of St. Martin's Lane have com
pleted a large and fine Organ, for the East Indies, with com
pound stops, the first of such which have yet been made, on the
Rev. Henry Liston's patent plan; in which instrument separate
pipes are provided for every sound (near GO in each octave) in all
the upper parts of the scale, and shaders for producing two or
three sounds (differing by comma major) from the same pipe, are
only used in some of the larger ranges of pipes, both for saving of
room, and because it has been found by experience, that in such
lower parts of the scale, the shaders act the best. lu a short time
Mr. Liston proposes to commence a Course of Lectures on the
musical scale, as now in use by singers, violinists, &c., illustrated
by experiments on all the chords in use, and by performances, on
this large organ.

   Expeditions to Africa. — Improved Mode     of making Bread.   463
                       EXPEDITIONS   TO AFRICA.
     Melancholy accounts have, we are sorry to say, been received $
respecting these expeditions. There are two : — the one intended
to penetrate from Senegal through the Deserts to the banks of the      -
Niger ; the other to proceed by steam-boats up the Congo, under
the idea that the former empties its waters into the Atlantic
through the latter great river, on the banks of which the two ex
peditions expected to meet ; — the former under the directions of
Major Peddiej the latter commanded by Captain Tuckey, who
proceeded sooner than had been generally reported. Major Ped-
die was at Senegal the end of September.         The following is an
extract of a letter from the agent to Lloyd's, dated Bahia, Oc
tober 30 : — " You will observe by the list herewith, the 'arrival of
the Congo and Dorothy, two ships fitted out on the coast of
Africa for a voyage of discovery ; they have put in here from the
opposite coast, in consequence of the sickly state of their remain -
fug crews, nearly two-thirds having died of the fever, including
the commander, first-lieutenant,     and botanists."

 with the new flour, in the proportion of from twenty to forty
 grains to a pound of flour, materially improves it for the purpose
 of making bread. Loaves made with the addition of the carbon
 ate of magnesia rise well in the oven ; and after being baked, the
 bread is light and spongy, has a good taste, and keeps well.       In
 cases when the new flour is of indifferent quality, from twenty to
 thirty grains' of the carbonate of magnesia to a pound of the flour
 will considerably improve the bread. When the flour is of the
 worst quality, forty grains to a pound of flour seem necessary to
 produce the same effect.
      " As the improvement in the bread from the new flour de
 pends upon the carbonate of magnesia, it is necessary that care
 should be taken to mix it intimately with the flour, previous to
  the making of the dough.
      " I have made a great; number of comparative experiments with
 bther substances, mixed in different proportions with the new
  flour. The fixed alkalies, both in their pure and carbonated, state,
  whenused in small quantity, to a certain extent improve the bread
  from the new flour ; but I have found no substance so efficacious
  in this respect as the carbonate of magnesia.

on the worst new seconds flour     I could procure. I have     also made
some trials on seconds and firsts of different quality.          In some
eases the results have been more striking and satisfactory than in
others — but in every instance the improvement of the bread, by
the carbonate of magnesia, has been obvious.           It may be neces
sary to remark, that,"    in all my experiments,     a proper attention
was paid to all the circumstances connected with the accuracy of
the results.    The materials were weighed and mixed together,
the dough was made up, and the bread baked, under my own in
spection.
    <£
       The trials I have made have       been necessarily    on a small
scale ; they have been performed chiefly on quantities of flour not
 exceeding a pound in weight.        I shall state the results of a com
 parative trial on the worst new seconds I could get, with and
 without the addition of the carbonate of magnesia.
    " I made five small loaves, each containing one pound of flour,
 one hundred grains of common salt, and a large table-spoonfull
 of yeast. The dough, in all of them, was made up with Water at
 the temperature of 100 deg. Faht. and exposed before the fire for
 two hours at the temperature of 70 deg. to ferment.
    The first loaf contained no other addition.
    The second                 10 grains of carbonate of magnesia.
    The third                  20 grains         do               do.
    The fourth                 30 grains         do               dp.
    The fifth                  40 grains         do               do.
     " After they had been all baked together in the same oven, the
 loaves when cold were examined.
     "The loaf without the carbonate of magnesia had fallen in the
 oven ; it was like a cake, and was soft and clammy, and readily
 adhered to the knife.
     " The loaf with the addition of ten grains of the carbonate of
 magnesia was improved ; it had risen better than that which con
 tained none, but still the improvement was not very considerable.
     "  The loaf with twenty grains was far superior to the one with
 ten grains ; it was for the most part light and porous ; but still
  there was a slight tendency to heaviness.        The loaf with thirty
 grains was still better than the one with twenty grains.          But the
  loaf with 40 grains was uniformly light and spongy, of a more re
  gular texture and better colour than any of the others.
     ** In all
               my experiments I have used the porter yeast, hut a
  successful trial has been made with the new barm.          I have never
  made any secret of the foregoing facts, but have readily commu
  nicated them to a number of gentlemen, to whom I have shown
  specimens of the bread made with, and without, the carbonate of
  magnesia, and they have uniformly given their assent to this im
  provement.

Improved Mode         ofmaking   Bread.  — Van Mons's Intelligence.     467
    "   I understand a number in Cork and in the neighbourhood
have been induced to repeat my experiments ; and they have, for
the most part, been attended with great success.            If there should
be any instances of failure, it would not be proper hastily to refer
 them to a defect in the method, but to impute them rather to a
want of attention to those circumstances necessary to insure suc
 cess.
    " I   conceive not the slightest danger can be apprehended from
the use of such an innocent substance, as the carbonate of mag
nesia, in such small proportion as is necessary to improve bread
from the new flour.        It is well known to be administered with
perfect safety, even to infants.        In order to try the effect oFbread
made with this substance on myself, I have used it exclusively for
the last five weeks, without the least inconvenience, in the pro
portion of sixty, eighty, and even one hundred grains, to a pound
of flour.
  . "
       A pound of carbonate of magnesia would be sufficient to mix
with two hundred and fifty-six pounds of the new flour, at the
 rate of thirty grains to the pound.         And supposing a pound of
carbonate of magnesia to costhalf-a-crown, the additional expense
 would be only half a farthing in the pound of flour.
    "  I am not quite satisfied as to the peculiar agency of the car
bonate of magnesia, in correcting the bad quality of new flour.
 It is an extremely light substance, and may probably tend to im
 prove the texture of the bread.         The new flour, too, in the pro
cess of baking, may perhaps be disposed to undergo the acetous
fermentation, and the carbonate of magnesia, being slightly al
 kaline, may correct the tendency of the fermented dough to aci
dity. On this part of the subject, however, the experiments I
 am now pursuing will. I trust, throw sortie light.

     I have learnt from Messrs. Gay Lussac and Arrago, that the
 system of chemistry and the names of substances are experiencing
 a new revolution, and that in a short time there will not remain
 one stone upon another of the existing edifice.
     M. Dulonghas made some experiments upon nitric acid, which
 fully confirm what I long since made known, that the fuming ni
 tric acid is simply nitric acid with nitric vapour interposed, in the
 same manner as the fuming sulphuric acid consists of sulphuric
 acid with sulphuric vapour interposed.            This vapour when set
 apart becomes crystallized : Dulong has found that the nitric va-

pour is liquefied by cold, and becomes coloured   ; he might without
doubt by a cold more intense have crystallized it. You will rej
collect that in the report of my experiments with a cold of 58° R.
t observed that the nitric and muriatic acids, in congealing, pro
duced two sorts of crystalline concretions, which when liquefied
take a red colour in the nitric acid and a greenish in the muriatic.
I mentioned further, that sulphuric acid dashed with nitric va--
pour, loses its colour before congealing, and recovers it on being
liquefied : that colour is considerably deepened when the fuming
sulphuric acid is heated in close vessels.    I propose during this
winter to submit to the same degree of 58K. the different com
pound gases ; for which purpose I have still all my apparatus and
a great store of muriate of lime.
    M. Virey in a communication to the French Academy of
Sciences (formerly the Institute) states that the spur 6f the rye
is not a champignon of the genus Scleroticum, as M. Decan-
dolle had endeavoured to prove j but that it is a real disease of
the grain ; since there are to be found in it all the peculiarities
of organization of the rve, a degeneration as yet unknown in
its nature, amylaceous fecula, and probably all the immediate
materials of the Cerealia.                       iUj ..
    Messrs, Beauvois, Thouin, and Thenard have also made a re
port to the Academy on two papers of M. Dupetit Thouars,
relative to the effect produced by frost on flowers and young
shoots.    M. Dupetit Thouars seems, according to the report, to
have been the first who perceived a small icicle even in the sub
stance of the calyx of some flowers; but almost all botanical
authors had already noticed this phenomenon             in the voung.
buds.     " In spring," observes M. Seunebier, " the new shoots     of
the ligneous plants are extremely tender, humid, and full of
aqueous juices : the frost then destrovs them with the herbaceous'
plants, because the water which is frozen occupies a greater
space than in the fluid form.     Its sudden expansion destroys the
frail orgairization of the vessels which coiUaiw this water : But
these alterations are more or less disastrous, according to the
nature of the organs, and their parts.    Thus, if those organs and.
those fibres were susceptible of a great expansibility, if they were
at the same time very elastic, and that they could resume their
first state as soon as the water thawed, then the dilatation of the'
water changed into ice will dilate the organs of the plants, and
they will resume their first form, without having preserved -any
apparent trace of alteration."      The committee are of opinion
that in this way we may account for the littje action which,
                                                                frosts

                    Lizards found in a Chalk Rock,                  46£
 frosts seem to have sometimes, according to Pvf. Dupetit Thouars,
Tipon the young shoots, and on the calices of the flowers.
                 LIZARDS FOUND IN A CHALK ROCK.
    Dr. Wilkinson lately presented     to the Bath Philosophical So
 ciety a letter he had received from a clergyman in Suffolk, rela
 tive to two lizards being discovered by the rev. gentleman in a
 chalk rock, with some interesting circumstances tending to ex
 plain why all the animals which have been discovered in rocks,
 marbles, &c. die on their exposure to the atmosphere.        From ob
servations made, there appeared to be some obstruction in their
 respiratory organs.     One being placed in water disengaged itself
 from this obstruction ; while the other died, from not being en
 abled to liberate itself from the viscous matter lining the throat.
 The clergyman in his letter says : " A pit having been opened in
 the summer of 1814, at Elden, Suffolk, for the purpose of raising
 chalk, I deemed it a favourable opportunity for procuring fossils;
 accordingly commissioned the men employed to search for and
 reserve whatever appeared curious.       In this search I sometimes
 assisted, and had the good fortune to be present at the discovery
 of two lizards imbedded in the solid chalk, fifty feet below the
 surface.   The following is the result of my observations: — So
 completely devoid of life did the lizards appear on their first ex
 posure to the air, that I actually considered them in a fossil state :
judge then of my surprise when, on my attempting to take them
 up, I percefved them move!        I immediately placed them in the
 sun, the heat of which soon restored them to animation.         In this
 state I carried them home, and immersed one in water, keeping
 the other in a dry place.     You may perhaps consider it worthy
 your  observation,  that  the mouths   of tiie lizards were closed up
 with a glutinous substance. This obstruction seemed to cause
 them great inconvenience, which was evident from the agitation
 perceptible in their throats, and from the frequent distension of
 the jaws, or rather around the jaws and the head; indeed they
'seemed in a state little short of suffocation.    The newt which had
 been immersed in water, after many violent struggles, was at
 length enabled to open its mouth : this afforded it instant relief,
 and it evidently derived mich satisfaction and comfort from its
 new element.     The other lixard, notwithstanding its repeated en
 deavours, was unable to open its mouth.          It died in the course
 of the night, probably from being debarred the use of its proper
 element. The remaining lizard continued alive in the water for se
 veral weeks, during which it appeared to increase in size. It dis
 liked confinement; and after many attempts, at length, to my great
 piortification, effected its escape, nor could I ever after find ft."
