           I.  On the Extra Current of the Induction Current.
                         By J. C. PoggenDoRFF+.
   IN August
         my latest investigation laid before the Royal Academy in
                  last, on the thermal action of electrical sparks, in
  order to test the view propounded by Reitlinger, that this action
  is proportional to the intensity of the current,      I had interposed
  very long wires, in the form of coils, in the path of an induction
 current.      I thereby observed that the sparks, notwithstanding
 the considerable enfeeblement in intensity produced by this in
 terposition, lost scarcely any of their heat, just as they have long
 been known to become thereby more fully luminous, but to lose
 little or none of their striking-distance.
     I  observed on this occasion that when the circuit of the        in
 ductorium is completely metallic through such accessory coils,
 the current, in spite of this metallic circuit, and in spite of the
 great enfeeblement which it experiences through the resistance
 of a very long and thin wire, possesses such tension that ex
tremely piercing sparks are obtained if the wires are merely
touched in one point with the hand.
     I further found that the free electricity at the end of the ac
cessory coil turned towards the positive pole of the inductorium
is positive, and negative at the other end; and that if two such
accessory coils are placed end to end, the wire joining them ex
hibits far less tension than the two wires leading from the coils
to the inductorium, from which           I  concluded that in the long
metallic circuit there must be a zero point of tension.          Finally,
I   convinced myself, by individual interruptions of the voltaic ex

the original view, and leads me         consider        tonot doubtful       it       as
that the tension observed proceeds from             induction current,     an
which the current        the inductorium, the current

to its own.

          is       designate the current
                             to           induction, which the         of
voltaic current can produce          own wire            its

                                   of the Induction Current.                                             8
closing, as an extra current,                       I
                                  do not hesitate to designate the
current in  question as the extra current of the induction current.
   To test this view more accurately, it appeared best to inves
tigate the deportment of various induction apparatus to each
other.
          I
      first combined two apparatus of this kind, as similar as pos
sible, in opposite directions, by joining in a corresponding manner
the two external divisions of an inductorium with three divisions,
by bright copper wires of small length. Although each of these
divisions only contained 1200 feet of copper wire of 0.25 millim.
in thickness, and, both united in the same direction, exhibited no
perceptible trace of tension, yet when united in opposite direc
tions their junction wires gave painful sparks.
   There was no current in this; for an electrical egg interposed
in one of the joining wires showed no luminous phenomena.
   Thereupon            I
                  combined this inductorium as a whole, in which
                                                                                                   .
it contained about 3800 feet of wire, in an opposite direction
with another large apparatus whose induction coil consisted of
23,000 feet of wire 3th of a millim. in thickness, in which                                              I
passed one and the same voltaic current through the inducing
coils of both, and interrupted them by one and the same hammer.
          I
      began by testing the induction coils singly, by causin
one to give sparks at the micrometer while the other was
by metal. As was to be presupposed, the larger apparatus was
the more powerful; the striking-distance of          sparks was more             its
than double that       the sparks
                             of       the smaller.  of

in the accessory coil, tension and sparks are observed in the
junction wires to a surprising degree. The supposition is most
natural that this result arises from a strengthening of the opposite
current; and if this supposition is confirmed, the inducing induc
tion current must be- enfeebled by the bundle of iron.                                     This is in
fact the case.
    I   was convinced      of this in the following manner.           joined                   I

of 23,000 feet, interposing at the same time a galvanometer and
a well-exhausted electrical egg—the latter for the double reason
of observing the luminous phenomena in                    and removing theit,
closing current,          that the hammer might

 But had no coil of a sufficient number of windings, which                                                          I
 might have inserted in the accessory coil, so as in this way com
pletely to destroy the opposite current.
    The inductorium itself gives the second proof of the existence
of the supposed opposite current. For to produce the often
mentioned phenomena of tension it is unnecessary to use an
accessory coil; the inductorium itself is quite sufficient.
   Nothing more is necessary than that, after the poles of the
instrument at work have been united with one another by a
short wire, the inducing coil together with         iron core      par            its                    be
tially withdrawn. On commencing, free electricity appears
the junction wire, and        increases until about two-thirds
                                            it                                                                    or in
three-fourths of the coil are withdrawn from the induction coil.
It     true that
        is          this case the empty part

                  far this result    not surprising.    is
   If  now the inducing coil       slowly reinserted, free electricity

natural.
   But,     may  it   asked, what happens
                               be                    this second process?   in

introduced into the path of the current. The striking-distance
stands obviously in a direct ratio to the electromotive force; and
when this latter is enfeebled by an opposite current, it can scarcely
be otherwise than that the striking-distance should also be
 diminished. Although my earlier investigations seem to speak
 against this,           I
                  believe that such a diminution actually occurs
 whenever the    interposed  wire is used in the form of coil, and
that it is only on the one hand the indefiniteness of the striking
 distance, and on the other the weakness of the partial current,
 which may have prevented this diminution from being perceived.
 It does not here depend so much on the absolute length of the
 coil added, as upon                 its
                                  the length                  the in              of

                          ratio                 the wire
                                                     to

                               a                                  en                                            its
feebling influence upon the inducing current,        most   strongly                    is
 developed, and then the diminution also naturally follows.
Some experiments which       made    this respect were favourable
                                           I                  in

 so, but always speaks of the length and resistance of the wire.
 So that    I do not consider the publication of my experiments to
 be superfluous.
     I  have, moreover, repeated the observations in the manner
 described by Koosen, and found them confirmed in the main
 point, as was to be expected; yet            I have also observed that it
 depends on the relation between the length of wire in the accessory
 coil and in the inductorium.              An accessory coil of 10,000 feet
 took    away  completely      the   sparks   of an inductorium of 23,000
 feet, while it left untouched those of a small instrument of 3000
 feet.    The phenomenon is best seen as one of partial currents and
 of resistance when a hemp thread 5 or 6 feet in length, moist
 ened with spring-water, which is fixed insulated in the air, once
 backwards and forwards, and connected with the poles of the
 spark micrometer.          By moving a wire bridge laid across, it can
 be shortened at     pleasure      for the current, and it may be observed
 that the first action upon the sparks consists in an attenuation
 of them.
 II.   On the Discrepance between the English and French Baro
    meter-Scales; and on the Corrections necessary in reducing the
    Readings to the Freezing-point.            By CHARLEs PACKE, Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
       AVING brought out with me a barometer graduated with
 H        a double scale, reading millimetres on one side and inches
on the other, I have been at some pains to investigate the slight
apparent anomaly existing between the French and English
scales as compared with the boiling-point, which                  I think may
be   satisfactorily  accounted for in the       following    manner:—

               Association.                         city of Vapour.
   The larger portion of this discrepance arises from the differ
ence of the standard temperature of the scales of the English
and French barometers; the remainder is accounted for by the
difference of latitude producing a variation of gravity.
    First as to the discrepance arising from the standard tempe
ratures. That of the English barometer being 30° F. higher
than that of the French scale, when the mercurial column is re

                   English and French Barometers.                 9
duced to the freezing-point, the scale of the French barometer
is also reduced to the freezing-point, but the scale of the English
one is only reduced to the temperature of 62°F.
    The consequence is that the French barometer, when reduced,
will always read higher than the English barometer.
    Let A be the height of the barometer observed;
         B the linear expansion of brass for 1°F. =:0000104344,     .
            as given by Laplace and Lavoisier, or 000018782 for
            10 C.
    The French barometer, when reduced, will, on account of the
difference of standard temperatures, read higher than the English
barometer by an amount =30 AB; e.g.,
    Let the height of the barometer be = the boiling-point 212°,
i.e. 29.905 inches.
       B=0000104344– log 5.018467
       A=29'905           = log 1'475743
                 30       = log 1:477121
                                3971331=-009861 inch excess of
                                                the French reading.
By changing A it will be evident that we get the excess for any
 height of the barometer, but for the average height at the sea
 level it may be taken as ‘009 inch.
    For exact observation, therefore, it is useless to have a baro
 meter marked with a double scale,      the   French and English:
 they cannot be made to coincide; e. g.
    Let the barometer read 29 inches = 736'59 millims. (temp.
 62°F. = 16*67C.). In the English scale at 62° (the temperature
 of the standard) no correction is made for the brass scale. The
  only correction is for the expansion of the mercury –'087,
                               29
                             –    087
                      reduced  28'913–734'38 millims.
    But in the French scale, the temperature of the standard being
 32°F., the correction to be made is for the expansion of the
  mercury — the expansion of the scale:
                                                    = ":212

                      reduced  734.61  = 28'9224   inches.

10                   Mr. C. Packe    on the Scales of the
.   To   reduce    the barometer to the freezing-point,      we have the
following formulae:—
    Let M = the cubic        expansion    of mercury for the number of
                degrees Centigrade or Fahrenheit, by which the
                observed temperature differs from the freezing-point.
          B = the linear expansion of the brass scale for the num
                  ber of degrees by which the observed temperature
                 differs from the standard.
          H=   the observed height of the barometer in inches         or
                 millimetres.
    The formula for the reduction of the English barometer will be
             Above 62°F.       .   .    .  .   — (M-B)     xH
             Below 62°, above     32°.     .   —(M +B) x H
             Below 32° . .         .    .  .   -- (M–B) x H
    For the reduction of     the French barometer,
             Above the freezing-point.          —(M–B) x H
             Below the freezing-point       .   --(M-B)    x H
    By the difference in the standard         temperatures  we can thus
account for -00936 inch out of the 017 by which the Kew
equivalent to the boiling-point differs from that of Regnault.
#.    remainder is almost exactly accounted for by the difference
of  gravitation.
    The increase of gravitation, i. e. gravity as diminished by the
centrifugal force, is from the equator to the poles = -0.052005,
or 00260 to the 45th degree of latitude.
    Adopting the law that it increases as the square of the sine of
the latitude, we find that in 51°30', the latitude of London, the
increase of gravity is =<0031852; in latitude 49°, that of Paris,
the increase of gravity ‘0029621.
    Let D be the difference of these two gravities =.0002231;
          *
          B' the height of the mercurial column at London, equiva
             lent to a given pressure;
                 corresponding height of the mercurial column at
               arlS.
B   will be equal    (B'+B'D): e.g.
    Gravity in lat. 51°    30'-0031852
    Gravity in lat.49°        =.0029621
                 Difference   = .0002281 = log 4:348805=D
                                   29.905= log 1'475744=B'
  . To compare, therefore, the barometric column at London
with that representing a corresponding pressure at Paris, we

                          English and French Barometers.                                                      11
must add two corrections—one for the difference of the tempe
rature of standard, and a second for the decrease of gravity.
The corrections will be as follows:—

                                            29.905

                                                 pressure at Paris.
   This is very close to the equivalent pressure which Regnault
gives in his Tables, 760 millims. =:29-922 inches”.
   Of course in a lower latitude the accurate correction for gravity
will be greater; but practically          Tables are made  all       corre                         to

supposed            be       the mean gravity

Similarly, the chances of a false assertion of white when red is
drawn = * * =#5. Total false assertions of white = }}, to be

Call the quantity within the brackets C; then if the credibility

is true), then the three together do not make it an even chance
that white was drawn. The odds are still 9 to 8 against it; and,
as before noticed, if the testimony of these is supported by a
        ,
number of independent witnesses whose average credibility is
only      it does not become a whit more probable. Common
sense shows that this is to allow too much to the extraordinary
character of the event, and that some condition must be involved
in the calculation which does not apply to the events of ordi
nary life.
    One such condition was introduced by the assumption
that when the witness is mistaken or deceived, there is no
diversity of error possible.   There are only two colours, and he
knows this; therefore if black is drawn and he is wrong, it can
only be by testifying to white. In order to apply such a for
mula to the evidence for an extraordinary event in general, we
must assume that, supposing it not to have occurred, any error
on the part of the witnesses must have led to        being reported.         its
Of course whenever this can shown, the circumstance detracts
immensely from the weight                       of be
                                   the testimony; but        very far               it   is
indeed from    being  generally  the case. Before examining the
problem more generally,         worth while

His credibility in these particular circumstances,                  therefore, is

the odds in his favour, instead of a to 1—a, are now 1-H a to
1—a, or more than double.
   The result will be the same if we introduce the supposition
that the witness intends to deceive, since the motives which
usually affect his veracity cannot be supposed to operate uni
formly in favour of the assertion of white when the remaining
colours are excluded.    Indeed we ought rather to suppose that
in the absence of these colours a proportionate number of the
motives to deception disappears; so that if his veracity be
and his judgment       r,   he   now affirms white truly     in
                                                                           772

cases, in which, if the other colours were present, he would be
induced to affirm some one of them falsely.
   But it is useless to pursue this hypothesis any further.
Enough has been said to show that it is altogether unfit to
furnish a general formula. It would be quite as reasonable to
neglect the probability of the event, and limit ourselves to that
of   itsassertion,    as  neglect the latter probability altogether.

It may be stated somewhat differently thus:–A witness whose

of which is p, and the chance of        being announced without          its
reason

    Now the case of arguments suggests an important question.
It often happens that when a proposition has been established
on probable evidence, it is found to lead to a further inference
which admits of being tested directly to some extent.    Thus the
proposition A may assert that a certain narrative is the work of
a credible witness, and B that a particular circumstance contained
in it is true. Our hypothesis                   true,    is,true; and
                                                                  If   A         is                  B
                                                                                                     is

                infer conversely,        false,      false. Logically
                                                       If    B        is                  A     is
these two propositions are convertible; yet there lurks           great                                           a

   2. Mayer was led from the contemplation of organic nature to
the publication of his first paper “On the Forces of Inorganic
Nature.”     An observation made in 1840, on the blood of a
patient in a tropical climate, was the origin of his scientific
writings.   It led him to the consideration of those physical
forces on which the phenomena of vitality depend.   This, if the
laws of life were ever to become amenable to scientific investi
gation, he knew must be          starting-point.               his

presses the heat which has been converted into mechanical effect.
The more perfect the machine, the less will be the amount of
heat obtainable from the condensation of the steam.    The best
engines give a difference of about 5 per cent. ; that is to say,
100 lbs. of coal, burnt in such a machine, give no more heat
than 95 lbs. which are burnt without doing any work.

           This is Mayer's calculation of the mechanical equivalent of
         heat.   He first published the result in 1842, making use of the
#        specific heat of air as determined by De la Roche and Berard.
         Substituting for it the subsequent and more accurate determina
         tion of M. Regnault, and changing in no particular the method
         of calculation, Mayer's equivalent, instead of 367, becomes 426
         kilogrammetres; Joule's equivalent is 425.

      16.     In  Philosophical Magazine for April 1863, Prof.
                    the
 William Thomson of Glasgow, and Prof. Tait of Edinburgh,
 express themselves thus:–“Does Prof. Tyndall know that
 Mayer's paper has no claims to novelty or correctness at all,
 saving this, that by a lucky chance he got an approximation to a
 true result from an utterly false analogy; and that even on this
 point he had been anticipated by Séguin, who, three years before
 the appearance of Mayer's paper, had obtained and published the
 same result from the same hypothesis.”      have nowhere in this         I
 paper introduced italics into quotations; wherever they occur
 they are in the original.
     17. And in reference to the same subject, a more recent
  anonymous northern writer* expresses himself thus:– “Of
  Séguin and Mayer, it seems not very difficult to estimate the
  claims, so far as the true theory or the mechanical equivalent of
  heat is concerned.      Séguin in 1839, and Mayer in 1842, gave
  as values of the mechanical equivalent: the first 363 kilogram
  metres, or, in terms of the ordinary British units, 660 foot
 pounds; the second the almost identical number 365 or 663.
  It is curious also to observe that the methods employed are
 almost identical.”
     18. Did the reputation of Dr. Mayer depend on his calculation
 of the mechanical equivalent of heat, and were the statements here
 quoted correct, his right to the recognition which have thought                        I
 his due might fairly be questioned.           But         inquire whether  let   us

         is       the case. The Table                         on

   19. The number 363 has been found for M. Séguin, not by
him: he never made the division which results in this quotient.
In 1847, for the first time, and without giving any description of
his method *, M. Séguin gives his results “reduced to the type
of 1 gramme elevated 1 metre, and corrected with reference to
the specific heat of water and vapour.” His equivalent there
given varies from 395 to 529 kilogrammetres (Comptes Rendus,
vol. xxv. p. 420). The data, moreover, on which M. Séguin
founded this last calculation were subsequently declared erro
neous by himself: the experiments of M. Regnault, he states,
“defeated the calculations” (Cosmos, vol.        684); and Mr.                 vi.
                                                                               p.

effect in the case of gunpowder, and finds in certain cases that
9 per cent. of the force of the consumed charcoal is expended on
the projectile.   He gives various illustrations of the generation
of heat by mechanical power, and describes some observations of
his own, made in a paper-mill, in which were four pulping
machines, each containing about 80 lbs. of paper and 1200 lbs.
of water. The surrounding temperature being 15°C., the pulp
rose in thirty-two minutes from 14° to 16°. The highest observed
temperature, which remained uniform for several hours, was 30°.
Assuming that in one minute a horse can raise 27,000 lbs, a foot
high, the heating of 1280 lbs. of water 1 degree in sixteen minutes
(not taking into account the heat communicated to the apparatus)
is equivalent to 3:16-horse power. The estimate in the factory
was, that the pulping machines were worked with 5-horse power.
Does the mechanical action of the five horses become nothing in
the machine? Fact replies, it becomes heat.

work to electricity and magnetism, and passes to the con                                                                                   º

the attraction is insensible, he regards as in a state of mechanical
separation; the falling of the weight to the earth as a case of
mechanical combination.      Such a weight would reach the earth's

tities of carbon just calculated would suffice for the times men
tioned.      In reality, however, besides the production of mecha
mical    effects, there is in the animal body a continuous genera
tion of heat. The chemical force contained in the food and
inspired oxygen is therefore the source of two other forms of
power, namely, mechanical motion and heat; and the sum of
these physical forces produced by an animal is the equivalent of
the contemporaneous chemical process.            Let the quantity of
mechanical work performed by an animal in a given time be col
lected, and converted by friction or some other means into
heat; add to this the heat generated immediately in the animal
body in the same time, we have then the exact quantity of
heat corresponding to the chemical processes that have taken
place.
     35. In the active animal, continues Mayer, the chemical
 changes are much greater than in the resting one. Let the
 amount of the chemical processes accomplished in a certain time
 in the resting animal be w, and in the active one a +y.             If
 during activity the same quantity of heat were generated as
 during rest, the additional chemical force y would correspond to
 the work performed.       In general, however, more heat is produced
 in the active     organism  than in the resting one.    During work,
 therefore, we shall have a    plus a portion    y
                                              of for heat, the residue
  of y being converted into mechanical effect.
     36.   I must now prove that the extra quantity of combustible
 matter consumed by the working animal contains the necessary
 force for the performance of the work. A strong horse, not
  working, is amply mourished on 15 lbs. of hay and 5 lbs. of oats
  a day. If the animal performed daily the work of lifting a weight
  of 12,960,000 lbs. 1 foot high, it could not exist on the same nu
 triment. To keep it in good condition we must add 11 lbs. of
  oats.    The 201bs. of nutriment first mentioned is the quantity
 which we have named a, and contains, according to Boussingault,
  8-074 lbs. of carbon.     The additional 11 lbs. of oats, our quan
  tity y, contains, according to the same authority, 4734.
     According to Boussingault, also, the carbon introduced is to
  that excreted in a combustible form as 3938 : 1364'4. Calcu
 lating from these data, we find w, or the quantity of carbon burnt
  by the resting animal, 5.2766 lbs., and y=8-0941bs. The quan
  tity consumed in mechanical effect is 1:34 lb., which we will
  call 2.
     37. We have therefore the following relations:—1. The
  mechanical effect is to the total consumption as 2: a +y=0.16.
  2. The mechanical effect is to the surplus consumption of the
  working animal as 2 : y=043. 3. The generation of heat at rest
  is to the generation of heat while working as a : æ--y—2=0.75.

40               Prof. Tyndall's Notes on Scientific History.
     38.   Inthe same way Mayer, taking the data furnished by
Liebig regarding the prisoners and soldiers at Giessen, deter
mines the following relations for a man.       1. The mechanical
effect is to the total consumption as 95.7 : 540=0,177. 2. The
mechanical effect is to the surplus consumption of the man at work
as 957:285=0:336.          3. The generation of heat in the resting
man to that in the     working man as 255 : 540–95:7-0-57.
   39. In these calculations, he continues, have confined       I                  my
self to the consumed carbon. If the heat of combustion be set
equal to the carbon--the hydrogen, the additional heat of the
hydrogen may be regarded as nearly=4th of that of the carbon.
According to the individual constitution and habits of life, the
labour and the consumption must be liable to considerable                          va
riations. The above results, however, serve to demonstrate the
following propositions:—
    (1.) The surplus nutriment consumed in the working                             or
ganism completely suffices to account for the work done.
    (2.) The maximum mechanical effect produced by a working
mammal hardly amounts to ºth of the force derivable from the
total quantity of carbon consumed.     The remaining #ths are
devoted to the generation of heat.

                         to enable them to convert
mechanical work, animals are provided with specific organs,
which are altogether wanting in plants. These are the muscles.
   41. To the activity of a muscle two things are necessary:—
1. The influence of the motor nerves as the determining condi
tion; and 2. the material changes as the cause of the mecha
nical effect.
   42. Like the whole organism, the organ itself, the muscle, has
 itspsychical and          its
                       physical side. Under the former we include

The whole paper of Prof. Thomson, published in the Philoso
phical Magazine for 1852, vol. iv., may be compared with the
writings of Dr. Mayer now before the reader.            I, however, will
limit   myself   here to the section “On the Power of Animated
Creatures over Matter” (p. 258).
    “A principal object of the present communication is to
point out the relation of this theory [that of animal heat and
motion] to the dynamical theory of heat. It is remarked, in the
first place, that both animal heat and weights raised or resistance
overcome, are mechanical effects of the chemical forces which act
during the combination of food with oxygen.              The former is a
dynamical mechanical effect, being thermal motions excited;
the latter is a mechanical effect of the statical kind. The whole
mechanical value of these effects, which are produced by means
of the animal mechanism in any time, must be equal to the me
chanical value of the work done by the chemical forces. Hence,
when an animal is going up-hill or working against resisting
force, there is less heat generated than the amount due to the
oxidation of the food, by the thermal equivalent of the mecha
nical effect produced.       From an estimate made by Mr. Joule
 [in 1846, Phil. Mag, vol. xxviii. p. 454], it appears that from
} to     of the mechanical equivalent of the complete oxidation of

day   as weights raised [Mayer published the same result             year                     a
previous    to  Mr. Joule, see 39]. The oxidation              the whole            of
food consumed being,          reality, far from complete [see Mayer,

 36   to 39],    itfollows that     less proportion than

pler combinations.  They therefore consume a quantity of chemi
cal forces, and generate in their place heat and mechanical forces,
As the last represent a comparatively small amount of work in
comparison with the amount of heat, the question of the con
servation of force reduces itself to this:—Do the combustion and
the change of materials in the nutriment generate an equal
quantity of heat to that yielded up by the animal? According
to the experiments of Dulong and Despretz, this question can, at
least approximately, be answered in the affirmative.”
   54. Helmholtz made this statement independently of Mayer,
for when he wrote he did not know what had been published two
years before at Heilbronn *; and clearly as the above paragraph
illustrates his insight on this momentous point, it could not be
accepted as an adequate abstract of Mayer's previous writings
on the same subject.     In a lecture of varied excellence, trans
lated   by myself, and  published  in the Philosophical Magazine,
1856, vol. ii., Helmholtz expresses in clear and beautiful lan
guage the relation of animals to vegetables, and of both to the
sun. The lecture was given at Königsberg on the 7th of Fe
bruary 1854; and if the reader wishes to realize fully the extent
to which Mayer had occupied this field, and the scantiness of
the additions made to our knowledge of vital dynamics during
the nine years following the publication of Mayer's essay, he may
compare pp. 509, 510, and 511 of Helmholtz’s lecture with sec
tions 4, 5, 6, and 7 of this résumé.

a personal tinge as I can under the circumstances impart to                                          it.

their author's names, and in an article which bears no name, but

ance and disappearance of bright stars, and the strange variations
of brilliancy of others which have caused so much astonishment.”
(Phil. Mag. vol. viii. p. 415). Three years previous to the
publication of the above paragraph Dr. Mayer wrote thus:—“It
is more than probable that the earth has come into existence in
some such way, and that in consequence of this process our sun,
as seen from the distance of the fixed stars, exhibited at that
epoch a transient burst of light.    But what took place in our
solar  system  perhaps millions of years ago, still goes on at the
present time here and there among the fixed stars; and the
 º
transient appearance of certain stars, which in some cases, like
the celebrated star Tycho, have at first an extraordinary degree
of brilliance, may be satisfactorily explained by assuming the
falling together of previously invisible double stars.” (Bemer

     57. A. the commencement of his paper “On the Mechanical
 Energies of the Solar System,” Prof Thomson states that this
 theory was never brought forward in any definite form, so far
 as he was aware, “until Mr. Waterston communicated to the
 British Association at Hull a remarkable speculation on cosmical
 dynamics (Dynamik des Himmels), in which he proposed the
 theory that solar heat is produced by the impact of meteors.”
 Mayer is here definitely ignored; and                   I
                                                assume the reason to
 be the same that         I
                        have assigned for Prof. Thomson's silence
regarding Mayer's writings on vital dynamics.          But he was not
left without  information;   in  my lecture in June 1862 I referred to
those writings in the following words:—“In 1853 Mr. Waterston
proposed independently the meteoric theory of the sun’s heat,
and in 1854 Prof. Wm. Thomson applied his admirable mathe
matical powers to the development of the theory; but six years
previously the subject had been handled in a masterly manner
by Mayer, and           all
                       that have said

derived from him.”       do not see how could have stated the truth

self acquainted with the essay        Mayerof and  nobly  bidding him
welcome, Prof. Thomson permits himself          sanction the following
                                                         to

to me that it contained a single ungentlemanly term. It brought
me expressions of approval and sympathy from some of the most
                                                    I
eminent men in Europe; and was so content with this, that                                     I
willingly—some thought, tamely—let the discussion drop. It was
quite natural that my style and matter should be the reverse of
agreeable to Prof. Thomson; and, as might be expected, he ex
}.ressed himself to this effect. He complained of the liberties which
        taken with his name; of the liberties I had taken with
other names.     In short, he considered my whole tone “unpre
cedented in scientific discussion,” and he declined having any
thing to do with me. On one technical question, moreover, he
made a complaint, to which, as it involves a point of personal
 courtesy, I am anxious to reply.      He complained that         had                    I
printed my letter in the Philosophical Magazine without sending
him the original.                I
                         am informed by good authority that the
course I   pursued  was the usual and proper one.        Had it been
customary to send the original in such a case, I should certainly
not have failed in this act of courtesy to Prof. Thomson,      Had                            I    S
even known his personal views on the matter,      should have sent         I
him the original, regardless of the general practice.  Nor should
I have allowed myself to be in any degree influenced by the fact
that Prof. Thomson had inserted in ‘Good Words’ expressions
injurious to my character, which circulated unknown to me among
the 120,000 readers of that periodical, until their accidental
discovery by my assistant gave me an opportunity of demonstra.
ting their baselessness.                  I
                            would at the same time remind him
that, though there is a dignity in silence when exercised at the
proper time and in the proper way, it is not dignity, nor even
manliness as defined in England, that permits a man to make
an unwarranted accusation, and prevents him from retracting it

which has with the desired motion eight, instead of five common
elements.
   We have done this, and found that the approximation in
question   may be attained by articulating, with each other and
with the beam, the four rods of Watt's parallelogram in the fol
lowing manner.       In this figure A B
represents the semi-beam upon which
                                                 Fig. 1.
it is required to construct a mechanism
capable of producing approximately
rectilineal motion along the vertical
line VW", passing through the extre
mity B of the beam when the latter
has a horizontal position. B C, DE,
CF, FG are the four rods composing
this mechanism; C is the point whose
motion is to be considered; and FG,
turning around a fixed axis G, repre
sents the counter-beam, as in Watt’s
parallelogram. These rods are articulated with each other and
with the beam in the same manner as in Watt’s parallelogram,
with the sole difference that the rods DE and FC, instead of
being connected with each other, are articulated with the counter
beam FG at two different points E and F. The lengths and
distances adopted are the    following:—
                    CF = FG=
                                  zººl AB,
                    BD=EG =
                                  4-lab.
Consequently BD is a mean proportional between AB and AD,
and EF is the half of AD.         The rods BC and DE have the
same length; and provided the latter do not sensibly exceed the
semi-path of the point C, it may be arbitrarily chosen.      The
centre of oscillation G of the counter-beam FG is chosen so that,
when the beam is horizontal, the rods BC and DE may be
vertical, and at the same time the rods              Fig. 2.
                                                                  V

   Such is the composition of the me
chanism which, with the same number         A
of rods as Watt     employed,   will give a
motion having eight elements in com

This fact may be very easily verified by
determining, as a function of the incli
nation of the beam, the variable distance

vertical motion, we have only considered how many elements
were common to the vertical and to the curve described by the
point C; the degree of approximation of the two, however,
depends also very essentially upon the position of these elements.
We have already examined this question in the first part of a
memoir entitled “Théorie des mécanismes connus sous le nom
des parallélogrammes **, and therein proposed methods for
rendering such an approximation as perfect as possible.       By
applying these methods to the case under consideration, we
should be led to introduce certain small changes in the values
of the several parameters, in order to render the mechanism as
perfect as possible.  By means of these corrections, the devia
tions of the point C would be reduced in the proportion of about
1 to 27 (see § 5 of the memoir cited).    But since, in practical
cases, these deviations, as we have seen, are themselves very                  º
small—amounting at most to some hundredths of a millimetre,
—it is evident that by the application of the above corrections
the theoretical precision of the apparatus might be carried to a
limit unattainable by the mechanician.     For ordinary practical
purposes, therefore, there is no inducement to seek a mecha
mism capable of giving rectilineal motion with greater accuracy.
This improved mechanism is the more worthy of attention, since,
as we have shown, the utmost desirable precision is attained by
employing the same number of pieces as in Watt’s parallelo
gram, whose practical defects are often experienced.
   We may observe, lastly, that the adjoining new form of the
mechanism is obtained by changing the signs of the radicals in
                           *
the foregoing values of the elements.

Now, viewing this latter substance, C, H, O, as a derivative of water,
it is clear that C, H, now called ethylene, has replaced two atoms of
hydrogen, and is therefore a binatomic body.” What a capital pro
cess this is for preparing oxide of ethylene—upon paper, and what a
pity that it does not answer equally well in sealed tubes |

    “Lavoisier put forward on this subject a very plausible theory,
 which was founded on the well-known fact that, if a gas be com.
 pressed, heat will be developed.” This passage not only contains
  a totally inadequate, and therefore erroneous statement of Lavoisier's
  “plausible theory,” but implies what is directly contrary to facts
  well known to all who have paid any attention to the history of
  chemistry—namely, that the phlogistic theory held its ground long
 after it had been discovered that combustible bodies increase in
 weight when burned, and that this observation first came to be
 regarded as a serious objection to the theory when it was shown by
 Lavoisier to be connected with the disappearance of part of the atmo
 sphere in which combustion takes place.
     Every one knows that the discovery of the composition of water
 is attributed by some authorities to Cavendish, and by others to James
 Watt; according to Dr. Apjohn, similar rival claims have been put
 forward to the discovery of hydrogen itself.                 He says (p. 130),
 “Hydrogen . . . . . was first distinguished by Cavendish in 1766,
 and to him the credit of              discovery     its

 good while engaged at intervals with an optico-chemical examination

 highly distinctive optical properties. The green substances yield
 solutions exhibiting        strong red fluorescence; the yellow substances

body to be examined may be either in the state of gas, or capable
of being volatilized at a moderate temperature, such as glass will bear
         softening, or                  its

of sulphur, one of the first and one of the second order. The spec
trum of the first order exhibited channeled spaces, like one of the
two spectra of that order of nitrogen; but the direction in which
the depth of shading increased was the reverse of what was observed
with nitrogen, the darker side of each channeled space being in the
case of sulphur directed towards the red end of the spectrum.
   Selenium, like sulphur, shows two spectra, one of the first and one
of the     second order.
    Incandescent carbon, even in a state of the finest division, gives a
continuous spectrum.         Among the gases which by their decomposi
tion, whether in flame or in the electric current, give the spectrum of
carbon, the authors describe particularly the spectra of cyanogen and
olefiant gas when burnt with oxygen or with air, and of carbonic oxide,
carbonic acid, marsh-gas, olefiant gas, and methyle rendered incan
descent by the electric discharge; they likewise describe the spec
trum of the electric discharge between electrodes of carbon in an
atmosphere of hydrogen.         The spectrum of carbon examined under
these various conditions showed great varieties, but                   the differentall
types observed were represented,                        less completely,

 bands like spectra       of the first order, and in each case a well-defined
 line-like   spectra   of the second order. On introducing chloride of
 barium into an      oxyhydrogen      jet, the shading of the bands was resolved
 into fine dark    lines,  proving     that the band spectrum of barium is in

      Spectra of the first order were observed in the case of only a few
 of the heavy metals, among which may be particularly mentioned lead,
 which, when its chloride, bromide, iodide, or oxide was introduced
 into an oxyhydrogen jet, gave a spectrum with bands which had a
 channeled appearance in consequence of a shading by fine dark
 lines.
      Chloride, bromide, and iodide of copper gave in a Bunsen’s lamp,
 or the                    jet, spectra with bands, and besides a few bright
 lines.        e bands in the three cases were not quite the same, but
 differed from one another by additional bands. Manganese showed
 a curious spectrum of the first order.           When an induction discharge
 passed between electrodes of copper or of manganese, pure spectra of
 these metals, of the second order, were obtained.

 of these phenomena from 1760 to the present time. This curve
 exhibits a maximum corresponding to 1788-6. Again, in Dalton's
 ‘Meteorology’ we have a list of aurorae observed at Kendaland Kes
wick from May 1786 to May 1793.

those at Keswick by Crosthwaite.              This list gives—

     The following observation is unconnected with the aurora borealis.
In examining the sun pictures taken with the Kew Heliograph under
the superintendence of Mr. De la Rue, it appears to be a nearly uni
versal law that the faculae belonging to a spot appear to the left of
that spot, the motion due to the sun's rotation being across the pic
ture from left to right.
     These pictures comprise a few taken in 1858, more in 1859, a few in
1861, and many more in 1862 and 1863, and they have been care

     dense glass prisms with refracting angles of 45°.

  March 23, 1864.—W. J. Hamilton, Esq., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On some new Fossils from the Lingula-flags of Wales.” By
J.   W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S., A.L.S.
    Since the author's paper last session, on the discovery of Para
dorides in Britain, the researches of Mr. Hicks have brought to light
so many new members of the hitherto scanty fauna of the Primordial        I.
zone, that Mr. Salter was now enabled to describe two new genera
                                                                           |
of Trilobites and a new genus of Sponges, and to complete the de           º
scription of Paradorides Davidis.      He also remarked that the fauna    º
of the Lingula-flags shows an approximation, in some of its genera,
to Lower Silurian forms, and some (the Shells and a Cystidean) are
of genera common to both formations; but the Crustacea, which are
the surest indices of the age of Palaeozoic rocks, are of entirely dis
tinct genera; and their evidence quite outweighs that of the other
fossils. The Primordial zone is moreover in Britain, separated from
the Caradoc and Llandeilo beds by the whole of the Tremadoc group,
at least 2000 feet thick.
    2. “On the Millstone-grit of North Staffordshire, and the ad
joining parts of Derbyshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire.”            By E.
 Hull, Esq., B.A., F.G.S., and A. H. Green, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    In this paper the Millstone-grit series was described, from the
 eastern edge of the Lancashire Coal-field southwards to the Coal
 fields of North Staffordshire,
    After giving a general sketch of the Geology of the district, and
 defining the upper and lower limits of the Millstone-grit, the authors
 explained a series of sections, running from east to west, at intervals,
 across the country.     In the most northerly of these the group con
 sists of five thick gritstone-beds, separated by seams of shale, and
 attains a thickness of more than 2000 feet; while on the extreme
 south all but two of these beds have thinned away, and the whole
 thickness is there not more than 300 or 400 feet.
    Between the base of the Millstone-grit and the Carboniferous
 Limestone lies a group of shales and sandstones, with thin earthy
 limestones towards the bottom, which seem to hold the place of the
 Yoredale Rocks of Yorkshire. The mineral character of these beds
 was described, and their place noted on the sections.
     A short notice was also given of two small inliers of Carboniferous
 Limestone, namely, at Moxon, east of Leek, and at Astbury, near
 Congleton.
      April 13.—W.     J.  Hamilton, Esq., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Geology and Mines of the Nevada Territory.”           By
 W. Phipps Blake, Esq.
    In describing the physical features of the country,       the author

Mr. H. Seeley     on the Red Rock in the Section at Hunstanton.       73
observed that it is an elevated semi-desert region, composed of a
succession of longitudinal mountain-ranges with intermediate valleys
and plains, the most abundant rocks being Metamorphic and
Igneous; but Tertiary strata and Carboniferous Limestone also
Occur.
    The author then described the hot springs, which are extended
along a line of fissure in a granitic rock, and parallel to the moun
tains, and which deposit silica in an amorphous and a granular
state, sulphur being also seen in the cracks and cavities of the sili
ceous deposit.      He considered these phenomena to illustrate the
formation of a    quartz-vein in a fissure.
     Mr. Blake then   gave an account    of certain mineral veins in por
phyry, which yield sulphurets of silver (including crystals of Ste
phanite, but very little ruby silver) and a little gold; also galena,
copper pyrites, iron pyrites, and a little native silver, the veinstone
being a friable quartz. The prevailing direction of the veins was
stated to be nearly north and south;       and the author remarked that
they were richer in gold near the surface than at greater depths.
     2. “On    the Red Rock in the Section         at Hunstanton.”    By
Harry Seeley, Esq., F.G.S., of the Woodwardian           Museum,    Cam
 bridge.
     The physical structure of the rock was first considered, and it was
 shown to be divisible into three beds, the uppermost of which is of a
 much lighter colour than the rest, the middle being concretionary in
 structure, and the lower sandy. These three beds, with the over
 lying white sponge-bed, were considered to belong to one formation,
 and were treated of in this paper as the Hunstanton Rock; but the
 thin band of red chalk some distance above was considered, though
 of similar colour, to be quite distinct, as also was the Carstone
 below.
     Mr. Seeley then showed that near Cambridge the Shanklin Sands
  and the Gault have both become very thin, so that there is a great
  probability of the latter being unconformable to the beds above as
  well as to those below. He considered the lower part of the Car
  stone to be of the age of the Shanklin sands; and as the Chalk is
  not unconformable to the Hunstanton Rock, he concluded that the
  latter could not be the Gault, but must be the Upper Greensand,-
  a conclusion which he afterwards showed was supported by the
  evidence of the fossils, and the occurrence of phosphate of lime.
      The seam of soapy clay which separates the Hunstanton Rock
  from the Chalk was supposed to have resulted from the disintegra
  tion of a portion of the former, the red colour of which the author
  endeavoured to show was due to Glauconite.
      The upper part of the red rock of Speeton was thought to be
   possibly newer than that of Hunstanton, and perhaps to represent
   the time which elapsed between the formation of the latter and that
   of the band of red chalk.
      In conclusion, Mr. Seeley remarked that as the phosphate of lime
   is confined to Bed No. 2, and as many individuals of Gault species
   occur in Bed No. 3, while others of a Chalk character are met with

  74                         Geological Society.
  in Bed No.    1, it is very probable that the Hunstanton Rock is a         º
  more  typical  example of the Upper Greensand than is seen at Cam
  bridge, and may represent also those periods which separate that
  formation from other divisions of the Cretaceous system.
      April 27.—W.     J. Hamilton, Esq., President, in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On the Geology of Arisaig, Nova Scotia.”          By the Rev. D.
 Honeyman, F.G.S.
     A careful examination of the country in the neighbourhood of
 Arisaig enabled the author to construct three sections and a map
 showing the geological constitution of the district.         Two of these
 sections were nearly parallel to one another, running from N. to S.,
 and taken some distance apart, while the third was nearly at right
 angles to the other two; thus a tolerably accurate idea of the
 geology of the country could be obtained. . The author described
 each of these sections in detail, giving lists of the fossils found in the
 different beds, which proved them to be of Upper Silurian age; and
 he further considered that they justified the adoption for the sub
 divisions of these Nova-Scotian Silurians of the terms May-hill,
 Lower Ludlow, Aymestry, and Tilestones, the first and third of
 which had been used for them previously by Mr. Salter.             Besides
 Silurian rocks, there occurs in the western part of this district a
 conglomerate of Lower Carboniferous age, while trap-rocks occur on
 the north and south.
    2. “On some Remains of Fishes from the “Upper Limestone” of
 the Permian Series of Durham.”        By J.  W. Kirkby, Esq.
    The object of this paper was to record the discovery of Fish
remains in the upper Magnesian Limestone of the Permian forma
tion, which is higher in that series than any vertebrate remains had
been previously known to occur. The strata exposed in the quarries
were described in detail, especially the bed from which most of the
Fishes were obtained, and which is known as the “flexible limestone.”
    The author stated that at least nine-tenths of the specimens
belong to Palaeoniscus varians, the remainder belonging to two or
three species of the same genus, and to a species of Acrolepis.
Detailed descriptions of the different species of Fishes were given, as
also were short notices of the species of Plants sometimes found
associated with them, one of which he believed to be Calamites
arenaceus, a Triassic species.     The occurrence of Palaeonisci with
smooth scales was stated to be antagonistic to Agassiz's conclusion
that the Permian species of that genus have striated, and the Coal
measure species smooth scales.          In conclusion Mr. Kirkby re         \
marked that the fauna of the period appeared to have an Estuarine
facies, and he expressed his opinion that the Fishes were imbedded
suddenly, as a result of some general catastrophe.
    3. “On the Fossil Corals of the West Indian Islands.-Part 3.
Mineral Condition.” By P. Martin Duncan, M.B. Lond., Sec. G.S.
    The results of the process of fossilization, as seen in the West
Indian fossil Corals, being very remarkable, and having much ob

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.          75
scured their specific characters, thus rendering their determination
extremely difficult, Dr. Duncan found it necessary to thoroughly
examine their different varieties of mineralization, and to compare
their present condition with the different stages in the decay and
fossilization of recent Corals as now seen in progress. Thus the
author was enabled to show the connexion between the destruction
of the minuter structures of the Coral by membrane decomposing
and certain forms of fossilization in which those structures are im
perfectly preserved; and he likewise stated that the filling-up of the
interspaces by granular carbonate of lime and other substances, as
well as the induration of certain species, during a “prefossil” and
“post-mortem” period, gave rise to certain varieties of fossilization,
and that the results of those operations were perpetuated in a fossil
state.
    The forms of mineralization described by Dr. Duncan are—
(1) Calcareous; (2) Siliceous; (3) Siliceous and Crystalline; (4)
 Siliceous and Destructive;         (5) Siliceous Casts; (6) Calcareo
siliceous; (7) Calcareo-siliceous and Destructive; . (8) Calcareo
siliceous Casts.
    In  describing these forms, especial reference was made to those in
which the structures were more or less destroyed during the re
placement (by silica) of the carbonate of lime which filled the inter
 spaces, and during that of the ordinary hard parts of the Coral.
    In explaining the nature and mode of formation of the large casts
 of calices from Antigua, the author drew attention to the fact that
 the silicification is more intense on the surface and in the centre of
 the corallum than in the intermediate region; and, when examined
 microscopically, it could be seen that the replacement of the carbo
 nate of lime began by the silica appearing as minute points in the
 centre of the interspaces and of the sclerenchyma, and not on their
 surface.     In conclusion, the relation of hydrated silica to destruc
 tive forms of fossilization was discussed, together with the influence
  of all the forms enumerated above in the preservation of organisms,
  and as one cause of the incompleteness of the geological record.
               IX.    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  REMARKS      ON   THE DISTILLATION OF SUBSTANCES OF DIFFERENT
                     WOLATILITIES.      BY M. CAREY LEA.
                                     have been recently published by M.
  Soº.        experiments which
         Berthelot recall to     me a similar and remarkable case which
  attracted my attention several years ago.
     M. Berthelot distilled 92 parts of alcohol and 8 of water, and
  found that the distillate at the beginning, middle, and end of the
  operation contained equal quantities of water and of alcohol.
     He distilled also a mixture containing a large quantity of sulphide
  of carbon and a small quantity of alcohol, and found that the least
  volatile body, the alcohol, passed over with the first portions of the

 distillate, so that toward the end of the operation the retort con
 tained sulphide of carbon almost pure.
    To these facts, which tend to cast the greatest doubt on all the
results obtained by the laborious process of fractional distillation, I
 now add the following.
    When a mixture containing the chlorides of ethylamine, diethyl
 amine, and triethylamine is distilled with caustic alkali, we should,
 according to received ideas, expect to find the ethylamine, which is
 a gas at ordinary temperatures, distil over first. Triethylamine,
which is at ordinary temperatures and pressures a liquid, separates
                                                       as its
as such when a strong solution of       chloride      treated with caustic is
alkali, and, floating on the surface,       have before pointed out, we
                                                           I
would naturally expect       find   principally
                                   to                 the latter stages    in                        of
the distillation.   The contrary              is, it

 NOTE ON THE RESIDUAL CHARGE OF ELECTRICAL CONDENSERS.

 researches the condenser was always charged for the same time,
 and discharged during the same fraction of a second; but the dis
 charge was separated from the charge by longer or shorter intervals.
 This kind of observation appeared to me very suitable for putting
 in evidence the true origin of the residual charge.
     I shall cite the results of a series of experiments in which the
 duration of the charge was limited, like that of the discharge, to a
 fraction of a second; the dielectric was a disk of shellac 6 millims.
 in thickness.
     1. The condenser was charged and gauged immediately after:
 the total charge was 45.
    2. The condenser, after being charged, was left to itself for 15
 minutes, and gauged at the end of this time: the total charge was
 again 45.                                                  -
    3. The condenser was     discharged  immediately    after being charged:
 the residual   charge   was zero.
    4. Lastly, the condenser was discharged 15 minutes after the
 charge: the residual charge was 27.
    Experiments 1 and 2 prove clearly that in the interval of 15
 minutes the armature gauged loses nothing of its charge, and that
 therefore no appreciable absorption is exerted by the shellac ; and
 yet it follows, from experiments 3 and 4, that in this time of 15
 minutes the residual charge rose from zero to 27. This increase of
 residual charge can only depend on a different arrangement of elec
 tricity in the interior of the dielectric. When the charge has only
been maintained for an instant, the parts of the dielectric which
possess a great conductibility alone participate in the transmission
of the influence; and as an instant is sufficient to polarize them,
an instant is sufficient to restore them to the neutral state.           If, on
the   contrary,  the  apparatus  has been   charged  for a  sufficiently   long

produced at a fixed point; the change of state becomes possible
when the temperature can give to the vapour an elastic force equal
to the external pressure; but this change takes place only very
rarely at the exact point at which its possibility commences.
    With a view to the study of ebullition, I have undertaken a great
number of experiments; and among others, I have endeavoured to
study ebullition by arriving at this phenomenon rather by a change
of pressure, which the liquid undergoes, than by an increase of
its temperature. The apparatus resembles, with certain modifica
tions, that which M. Regnault used                 studying the elastic force
                                                                 in

than with distilled water; but nevertheless very frequent retarda
tions of 10°, 15°, and more are seen, as in preceding experiments.
    The presence of platinum, and in general of metallic substances,
is known to have the reputation of hindering retardations of ebul
lition in glass vessels; and for a long time platinum wires have
been used in concentrating liquids to prevent them from jumping
over. Platinum wires placed in distilled water hinder, in fact, these
retardations from being produced when, after having been heated
once or twice to 100°, water is subjected to a diminution of
pressure.    But if the liquid containing platinum wire is heated to
boiling for several times, and then allowed to cool—if especially
platinum is for some days in contact with water at the bottom of
the vessel, it is soon seen that the metal has become inactive, and
then delays are observed as considerable as if water alone were in the
retort.   If ordinary water is taken abundantly carbonated, if along
with it various solid bodies are introduced, facts are observed ana
logous to that which has been mentioned in the case of platinum.
 I have tried pieces of iron, lead, tin, zinc, copper, &c.; fragments
of chalk, of wood, of quartz, paper, &c. In the first reheating, the
presence of these bodies prevents any retardation, and ebullition
takes place at the exact point at which the temperature of the liquid
imparts to the vapour an elastic force equal to the superficial pres
sure.   But if they are left for some time in contact with water,
heated four or five times to ebullition, the contact of all these bodies
appears to have become indifferent, and the liquid furnishes then
very frequent examples of the retardation of ebullition.        The                            fol
lowing are some examples in which the retort contained ordinary
water, with fragments of iron, platinum, lead, chalk, and wood:—

These correspond to retardations of 5°5, 21°8, 22°, 23°.    Ebul
lition then  commenced,    sometimes spontaneously, sometimes by                                     --

              Royal Society has already done me the honour of pub
    THElishing      in the Philosophical Transactions three memoirs
    on the relations of radiant heat to the gaseous form of matter.
    In the first of these memoirst it was shown that for heat ema
    nating from the blackened surface of a cube filled with boiling
    water, a class of bodies which had been previously regarded as
    equally, and indeed, as far as laboratory experiments went, per
    fectly diathermic, exhibited vast differences both as regards radia
    tion and absorption.    At the common tension of one atmosphere
     the   absorptive energy        of
                                 olefiant gas, for example, was found                   to
    be  290 times that      air,
                               of while when lower pressures were em
    ployed the ratio was still   greater.    The reciprocity   absorption    of

82.           Prof. Tyndall on the Absorption and Radiation
shown to possess 970 times the absorptive energy of atmospheric
air, while it was shown to be probable that, when pressures of
sºuth of an atmosphere were compared, the absorption of olefiant
gas was nearly 8000 times that of air.    A column of ammoniacal
gas, moreover, 3 feet long, was found sensibly impervious to the
heat employed in the inquiry, while the vapours of many of the
volatile liquids were proved to be still more opake to radiant heat
than even the most powerfully acting permanent gases.       In this
second investigation, the discovery of dynamic radiation and
absorption is also announced and illustrated, and the action of
odours and of ozone on radiant heat is made the subject of expe
riment.

   Sulphuric ether vapour, therefore, commences with an absorp
tion much lower than that of olefiant gas, and ends with a higher
absorption. This is quite in accordance with the result esta
blished in my second memoir”, that in a short tube the absorp
tion effected by the sparsely scattered molecules of a vapour may
be less than that of a gas at a tension of an atmosphere, while in
a long tube the gas may be exceeded by the vapour.            The deport
ment of sulphuric ether indicates what mighty changes of climate
might be brought about by the introduction into the earth’s at
mosphere of an almost infinitesimal amount of a powerful vapour.
And if aqueous vapour can be shown to be thus powerful, the effect
of   its
       withdrawal from our atmosphere may               inferred.               be

beif  the rays had entered without first traversing the gas         the                         of

determinations are not very wide of the truth.                              Irregularities,
however, are revealed.   Some remarkable ones occur in the case
of carbonic acid, with the chambers 23-8 and 25-6,-the absorp
tions in the first chamber varying in this instance from 11:7 to
10-4, and in the second chamber from 11:4 to 10:5, and in both
chambers from 13:1 to 12-0.    The gas which gave the largest
of these results was generated from marble and hydrochloric
acid; the next was obtained from chalk and sulphuric acid, and
the gas which gave the smallest result was obtained from bicar
bonate  of soda and sulphuric acid. The slight differences accom
panying these different modes of generation made themselves
felt in the manner recorded in the Table.

absorptions   and the absorption of the sum            general, less           is,   in
than     the case
             in      gases.  This resolves itself into the proposi

98         Prof. Tyndall        on the Absorption               and Radiation
venience  Ihave called the radiation and absorption of a gas or
vapour thus dynamically heated and cooled, dynamic radiation
and dynamic absorption.
   In illustration of the manner in which dynamic radiation may
be applied in researches on radiant heat, I have had made,
during the last half-year, a considerable number of experiments,
some of which       I
                   will here describe. In the first place, the expe
rimental tube was divided into two compartments, as in                                       the
experiments described       the foregoing section.

                          of
by    transparent plate       rock-salt, while the space between
                                                                                             of the
     a                          of
ends was divided into two compartments                            by
                                                        second plate   a

               the   tube,  the  compensating    cube,  however,    being
abandoned.      For the sake         of
                                   convenient  reference,    will call     I                 the
compartment         the tube most distant from the pile the first
                    of

   The experiments were conducted         the following manner:-

Both compartments being exhausted and the needle             zero,                 at         the
gas was allowed          to

pile through the vacuous second chamber; the needle moved
and the limit       of
                   its excursion was noted.      The first chamber
was then exhausted and carefully cleansed with dry air. The
second chamber was filled with the same gas, not with         view                  a         to

    exactly as in the first experiment, the only difference between
    the two experiments     being, that in the first the heat passed
    through a vacuum to the pile, while in the second it had to pass
    through a column of the same kind of gas as that from which it
    emanated.    In this way the absorption exerted by any gas upon
    heat radiated from the same gas, or from any other gas, may
    be accurately determined.    Finally, the apparatus being cleansed
    and the needle at zero, the gas  was permitted to enter the second
    chamber, and         its
                     dynamic radiation from this chamber was deter
    mined.   The intermediate plate       salt    was shifted,

  The gases, it will be observed, exhibit a gradually increasing
power  of dynamic radiation from carbonic oxide up to olefiant
gas.   This is most clearly illustrated by reference to the results
obtained in the respective cases with the first length of                                                         the

  A  brass tube 3 feet long, and very slightly tarnished within,
was used for dynamic radiation.      Dry air on entering the tube
produced a deflection of 12 degrees.   The tube was then polished.
within, and the experiment repeated; the action of dry air was
instantly reduced to 7.5 degrees.
   The rock-salt plate at the end of the tube was then removed,
and a lining of black paper 2 feet long was introduced within                                              it.
The tube was again closed, and the experiment        allowing dry                 of
 air   to

   To ascertain whether the absorption by the vapours bears any
significant relation to the absorption by the liquids from which
these vapours were derived, the transmission      of radiant heat
through those liquids was examined.     The open flame of an oil
lamp was used, and the liquids were enclosed in rock-salt cells.
Thus the total radiation from the lamp, with the exception of
 theminute fraction absorbed                               by

that when a liquid is a powerful absorber the vapour of that
liquid is sure also to be a powerful absorber.

the salt of which the cell was formed, but the absorptive energy
is due solely to the water. We might infer from this alone, were

in the Philosophical Magazine for September 1861, and described
by Professor Tyndall in his memoirs “On the Absorption and
Radiation of Heat by Gaseous Matter.”     The source of heat was
a small flame of carbonic oxide. It is well known in what a
capricious and unstable manner carbonic oxide burns in the open
air, as it is extremely difficult to keep a small flame of this gas
from being extinguished when unguarded from the currents of
air present in a room. The first consideration was therefore to
provide a means of protecting the source, so as to bring it under
control and render it at once steady and uniform. The follow
ing method was finally adopted and adhered to throughout the
investigation.

sides     of   the glass globe.
       The radiation from the flame, after passing through the expe
rimental tube, fell                on   the anterior face               of   a    thermo-electric pile,

and produced a certain deflection in a delicate galvanometer;
this deflection was neutralized by a compensating cube contain
ing water heated by steam and placed before the opposite face of
the pile. The needle of the galvanometer was brought precisely
to zero by the adjustment of a double metal screen placed between
the cube and the pile. Another double screen of plated metal
was now introduced between the tube and the source; a deflec
tion of the needle took place indicating the amount of heat fall
ing on the posterior face of the pile; and as this amount exactly
neutralized the radiation from the flame, it corresponded to that
radiation, and consequently gave the total heat emitted by the
source.   This deflection was carefully noted; the double silvered
screen was now removed; the needle then descended to zero,
and everything was ready for the first experiment.
   After taking the total heat in the above manner, the brass
adjusting screen before the compensating cube was left untouched,
the slight variations which occurred throughout the day being
remedied by altering, within small limits, the size or distance of
the source.
    The experimental tube having been exhausted, and the needle
 of the galvanometer standing at zero,                         air
                                                 from the laboratory was

 solution     potash, and then over sulphuric acid into the experi

º-r   our atmosphere was easily measurable, and far exceeded the
      absorption by the aqueous vapour.     The quantity of this latter
      gas is about 35 times the quantity of carbonic acid, and yet
      the generally feeble carbonic acid intercepts nearly 8 per cent.
      more  of the radiation from a carbonic oxide flame.   Taking
      the average  state of our atmosphere as containing by volume
      4 parts of carbonic acid and 140 parts of aqueous vapour in
      every  10,000 parts of air, and estimating the quantities of
      these gases present in the laboratory at the time of experiment
      at double this amount, the absolute quantities contained in the
      experimental tube and producing the above absorptions are found
      to be "18 cubic inch of carbonic acid and 6-3 cubic inches of
      aqueous vapour, the capacity                  of the tube itself being 225 cubic
      inches.
        In the memoir by Professor Tyndall referred to at the com
      mencement, it was stated that the degree of accord between the
      oscillating periods of the molecules of a source of heat and those of
      a body placed  in the path of               its
                                       rays, determines the amount         ab                         of
      sorption which those rays will undergo       passing through the
                                                                   in                                       in

     A platinum spiral,    heated to whiteness by a voltaic current,
was  substituted for the carbonic oxide flame,       the object of this
being to compare the relative absorption, by air and breath, of
the heat emitted from the incandescent spiral and from the flame.
With the spiral as source, 30 inches of common              absorbed                       air                 5

renewed, for the purpose          making numerous measurements

   Two large vulcanized india-rubber bags, provided with suitable

        Referring to Table W., we see that 30 inches of breath from
     bag No. IV. absorbed 54 per cent. of the whole radiation.    The
     nearest approach to this absorption    is the first in the above
     Table, and from this we may roughly assume that about 2.4
     inches of pure carbonic acid gives about the same absorption as
<U+017F>º   30 inches of dried breath.  The following proportion should then

                      it
     8 per cent. of carbonic acid. Chemical analysis shows us that
     there is but 5.2 per cent. of carbonic acid in this specimen of
     breath.   Here is at once a formidable difficulty.      It would be
     impossible to doubt the correctness of Dr. Frankland’s analysis,

  We have here raised the absorption by the pure gas, but the
calculated  percentage is still very wide of the mark. Theoreti
cally, nearly 1.6 inch of the pure carbonic acid should give the
same absorption as 30 inches of breath from bag No. IV.      The
discrepancy was evidently not owing to any external cause; and
the only difference was, that in the case of breath the carbonic
acid was mixed with air, whilst with the pure gas no such medium
was present.    Possibly the air might have had an effect upon
the carbonic acid somewhat similar to that which it is known
to have upon aqueous vapour, by preventing any partial conden
sation of the gas. The following is the result of an experiment
made to decide this question:—

 It  will be seen in the above Table that the absorption suddenly
 rises at five-tenths of an inch : it will also be observed that the
 effect of  filling the tube with 7 inches of dry air adds scarcely
 anything to the previous absorption.
    These results, with a few others not before recorded, are placed
 together in the following Table, in which the first column shows
 the absorption by carbonic acid alone, and the second the absorp
 tion by the same amounts of carbonic acid added to about 20
 inches of dry air, the absorption by the latter being nil:—

    The slight discrepancy between some of the repeated observa
tions is probably the result of a small chemical difference in the
carbonic acid prepared at different periods.
    This Table gives us the power of calculating the percentage of
carbonic acid in the different samples of breath; to obtain greater
accuracy, omissions in Table XII., and the intervals between the
tenths of an inch, are calculated and given with the mean expe
rimental results in the annexed Table.

made, it is sufficiently near to prove the correctness of the prin

entered the experimental tube, the following experiment was
made.
   A  glass bolt-head, having rather       larger capacity than the   a
brass tube, was fitted with cap and stopcock and well exhausted.

A  stopcock was now carefully opened, and 1:4 inch          dry car                       of
bonic acid allowed       enter the bolt-head. The
                                   to                  stopcock  was
then promptly closed, the drying-tubes and gas-holder removed,
and pure dry air caused                               fill
                                 the glass vessel. Thus

breath.   The bolt-head was next connected with the experi
mental  tube, and the latter thoroughly exhausted, the source of
heat and the tube remaining the same as in previous experi
ments.    Communication between the bolt-head and tube was
then made, and closed when the barometer-gauge had sunk 15
inches.   The needle showed a deflection of 28°1, or an absorp
tion of 43.3 per cent.   When the whole contents of the bolt
head were allowed to diffuse themselves between the vessel and
the tube, it was found that the mercury of the gauge had sunk
nearly 17 inches. The absorption found in the last observation
was therefore due to rather less than half the quantity of gas
admitted into the bolt-head.
  After the tube had been cleansed and exhausted, 0-7 inch of
carbonic acid was allowed to enter: this quantity of gas gave an
absorption of 34.7 per cent.; but when 143 inches of dry air
were added to the gas in the tube, the absorption rose to 43-6
per cent.  The absorption of the mixture from the bolt-head,
containing rather less than 0-7 inch of carbonic acid, was found
to be 43.3 per cent. Thus no difference exists between the ab
sorption when carbonic acid and dry air are admitted into the
tube together, or when they are allowed to enter successively.
  In the first section of this paper some experiments are recorded
which determine the absorption by the carbonic acid in the atmo
sphere. The amount of carbonic acid producing this absorption is
so extremely small, that it is impossible to measure anything like
its quantity with the barometer attached          the air-pump.       to                     A

 122              Mr.   J.   Croll     on the    Physical Cause of    the
 regarding their cause and origin. The great diversity and ex
 treme character of those changes, as indicated by the remains of
 ancient flora and fauna, are such as to render it difficult to find
 any possible cause adequate for the effect.
    The point regarding which the greatest difficulty has been
 felt, is in accounting for the extreme cold of the glacial epoch,
 and the warm and tropical character of the carboniferous.
    Before entering on the consideration of a cause which appears
 in a great measure to have been overlooked by geologists, we
 shall briefly refer to a few of the more prominent theories which
 have been advanced to account for those changes.
    The warm character of the climate during the Silurian, Car
 boniferous and other periods of the Palaeozoic age, was at one
 time generally referred by geologists to the influence of the
 earth's internal heat.      But it has been proved by Professor
 William Thomson* that the general climate of our globe could
 not have been sensibly affected by internal heat at any time
 more than 10,000 years after the commencement of the solidi
 fication of the surface. And Mr. Hopkins has concluded:f that the
 present effect of internal heat is only about goth of a degree on
 the mean superficial temperature.        Professor W. Thomson, from
 calculations based upon more correct data, has lately found that it
 only amounts to about ºth of adegreef. Professor Phillips, how
 ever, is still of opinion that the warm climates of ancient epochs
 may have been due to the influence of internal heat. He does not
 question the correctness of the calculations made by Thomson,
 Fourier, Poisson, and others, but thinks that they have over
looked the fact that the condition of the earth’s atmosphere, as
regards     itspower     conducting heat, might have been different
                            of
in  former ages from what              itpresent.

atmospheric mantle,”              he
                             says, “which envelopes the terraqueous
globe, mitigates solar heat and stellar radiation, and, like the
clothing     of    steam cylinder, prevents excessive waste
                   a                                                 the     of

been     so fardifferent from what it is at present, that by
means of it the internal heat could have produced and main
tained that high temperature of climate which is supposed by
some to have prevailed during the long Palaeozoic ages of the
earth's history.   And besides, the important fact is overlooked
that  any   change  in the condition of the atmosphere which
would prevent the dissipation of the earth’s internal heat into
surrounding space, such as an increase in the quantity of
aqueous vapour contained in the atmosphere, would at the same
time tend to lower the temperature of the earth's surface by
diminishing the quantity of radiant heat reaching the surface
from without.    Such a state of things would no doubt equalize,
to a certain  extent, the extremes of summer and winter tem
perature, but would not very sensibly increase the mean annual
temperature of the climate.    In fact it would rather have
                                                        -   an op
posite   tendency.
  Some have attempted to account for the change of climate
by assuming that the earth’s axis of rotation may have shifted
   position

others, that the earth’s equatorial protuberance       such, that                    is                     no

                            surface could ever possibly alter the
position       of
            the axis    rotation         extent which could

 124               Mr.       J.   Croll on the Physical Cause of the
cold body. Astronomical science affords not the slightest evi
dence in favour of such an hypothesis #.
   A theory has lately been propounded by Prof. Franklandt,
wherein the changes of climate experienced by our earth during
past epochs is referred to a difference in the influence of internal
heat on the sea and on land.       He concludes that the cooling of the
floor of the ocean would not      proceed  so rapidly as if it had been
freely exposed to the air. And hence it would continue at a
comparatively high temperature long after the surface of the
dry land had reached                  its
                              present mean temperature.           And                                       as
heat     transmitted from the bottom          the surface      the ocean,
                                                                     to                       of
       byis                           by                                        by
not      conduction, but       convection, viz.        the warm stratum
of  water      contact with the bottom rising
              in                                         the surface, the           to
temperature        the ocean would consequently
                    of                                       higher than                 be
the mean     temperature              of
                                the earth's surface.       He concludes
that this state       things satisfactorily accounts for the glacial
                         of
epoch. “The sole cause         the phenomena
                                         of           the glacial epoch,”      of
 he  says, “was      higher temperature            the ocean than that    of
                        at a
which obtains       present.”                                      -
   The high temperature            the ocean,
                                            of      believes, would give   he
rise   toaugmented atmospheric precipitation.            This would pro
duce such          an
                 accumulation        snow during winter months
                                                 of                                                         as
would defy the heat          summer of       melt.    The overcast sky
                                                                to
during summer, caused             the    by

would intercept the sun’s rays, and thus reduce the summer's
temperature.
   While admitting the general correctness    Prof. Frankland’s                 of
theory, we, however, fear that   does not altogether harmonize
                                                   it

 dying out in the deep and cold recesses of the ocean where they
have retreated         in order to find            a temperature   more congenial     to
their nature *.
   We freely admit that a warmer sea and a colder land would
tend to produce an accumulation of snow and ice such as pre
vailed during the glacial period. And did the facts of geology
and the principles of physical science favour the idea that the
sea during that period was warmer than at present, we should
assuredly admit the warm sea to be at least one of the causes
of the glacial epoch. But when the very same result may be
conceived to follow upon the contrary supposition, which agrees
better with the evidence of geology—that the sea was actually
colder during the glacial period than at present—we feel inclined
to refer the cold of that period to some other cause than to a
warm sea. That a reduction of the mean temperature of both
land and sea in our latitude would produce the same effect, will
be obvious to all who will but reflect that at the present day
there exists in places where the mean annual temperature is not
much above the zero of the Fahrenheit scale, glaciers in magni
tude equal       to,
                   not greater than any which covered our valleys

But the existence of glaciers in such an early age is certainly in
consistent with Prof. Frankland’s theory, and in fact with every
possible theory based upon the principle of internal heat.
  Prof. Frankland accounts for the glaciers of the Permian
period as       follows:–
     “I    have already argued,”     he says, “that perpetual snow
 would first tip the mountain peaks, and then slowly and gra
 dually descend to the sea-level.       But it must be borne in mind
 that during the whole of the pre-glacial period the atmo
 spheric precipitation was even greater than during that period,
 and consequently wherever the land rose well above the snow
 line, glaciers, on a scale far surpassing any of the present time,
 would be the inevitable consequence ’’ +.
    But glaciers on the sides of elevated mountains will not ex
 plain the facts of the Permian breccia. These breccias afford
 conclusive evidence that in that early age our British mountains
 were not only covered with perpetual snow, but must have had
 glaciers stretching into the sea, and breaking up and floating
 away as icebergs in a manner similar to what we find occurring
 in Greenland at the present day. We cannot do better than
 state the matter in Prof. Ramsay’s own words.
     “These breccias are chiefly formed of the moraine-matter of
 glaciers, drifted and scattered in the Permian sea by the agency
 of icebergs . . . They were therefore deposited in water with
 considerable regularity, and, as we have seen, over a large area.
It is altogether unlikely that the stones were poured into the
sea by rivers in the manner in which some conglomerates are
formed on steep coasts where mountain-ridges nearly approach
the shore, 1st, because the fragments, being derived almost
exclusively from the Longmynd country, if the sea then washed
 its old shores,         no
                      river-currents passing out        sea could carry

            Change   of Climate during Geological Epochs.           127
period, following as they really do immediately after the warm
coal-period 7
   Passing beyond the coal-period to the earlier age of the Old
Red Sandstone, we again meet with the evidence of glacial ac
tion*.
   It  was long ago suggested by Agassiz, that the ancient climate
was   subject to alternate depressions and risings of temperature,
coinciding with great destruction and renewal of life. Modern
geological investigation seems to favour this conjecture. “Thus,
looking,” says Mr. Page, “at the Cambrian strata of the
northern hemisphere—their angular grits and conglomerates,
their extreme paucity of fossil forms, and other features—we
are at once reminded of the action of ice and the presence of
ungenial conditions. This is followed over the same areas by
the more genial and exuberant period of Siluria; which is in
turn succeeded by the Old Red Sandstone, whose grits and
bouldery conglomerates, as well as paucity of vegetable forms,
once more suggest the recurrence of colder influences.          Follow
ing the Old Red, we have the exuberant flora and fauna of the
coal-period, again to be succeeded by the scanty life-forms and
grits and conglomerates of Permia. Again the trias and oolite
of the northern hemisphere are characterized by life-forms that
betoken warm and genial conditions; while the chalk that suc
ceeds imbeds water-worn blocks of granite and lignite, which
would seem to imply the presence of ice-drift and deposit in
seas that were open to boreal influences.         Next the early terti
aries occur over the same     areas,  marked    by  plants and animals
that indicate a warm and      genial  climate;   and this in turn gives
place to the well-known glacial or boulder-drift epoch, once
more to be succeeded by the milder influences of the post-ter
tiary or current era” +.
   The principal cause why geologists have been so slow in ad
mitting the existence of cold epochs during the earlier ages of
our earth’s history, is the idea still entertained by some, that,
owing to the influence of internal heat, the climate of our globe
was then very much warmer than at present, and that, ever since,
it has been gradually growing colder and colder in consequence
of the decrease of internal heat. But, as we have already seen,
the notion is quite erroneous.       If the climate in former ages was
warmer than at    present,  the cause must be sought for elsewhere.
   Some have referred the change of climate to a difference in
the distribution of land and sea. It has been supposed by some,

 for example, that the cold of the glacial epoch might result
 from the absence of the Gulf-stream during that period.
    Mr. Hopkins calculates that the absence of the Gulf-stream
 would lower the mean temperature of January 24°F. in the
 north of Scotland, but could have no sensible influence on the
 July temperature of London, or places in western Europe further
 to the south*.

   Were the indications of ancient glaciers confined to the
western parts of Europe, the absence of the Gulf-stream might
to a considerable extent account for the phenomena of the glacial
period. But we know that the glaciation extended over the
greater part of northern Europe and northern America.       It is
perfectly evident that the absence of the Gulf-stream in our seas
could not, for example, greatly lower the temperature of the
climate of North America. Neither would a decrease of 3° F.
 in the mean annual temperature of the Alps, account for the
 enormous glaciers which we know existed there during that
 p eriod.
     Sir Charles Lyell supposes that, were the land              collected                all

 extent that would account for the glacial epoch.            And on the
 other   hand, were the land       collected    all
                                               along the  equator,   while
 the poles were covered with sea,         temperature such  a      existed                   as
 during the coal-period might           produced.     Professor Phillips

 temperature        the globe would

facts regarding the glacial deposits, for these require deep sea

 130               Mr.       J.    Croll on the Physical Cause of the
    According to the calculations of Leverrier, the superior limit
•of the earth's excentricity is .07775, and the inferior limit
 -003314. The excentricity is at present diminishing, and will
 continue to do so during 23,980 years from the year 1800*.
    The change in the excentricity of the earth’s orbit may affect
 the climate in two different ways; viz., it may affect the climate
 by either increasing or diminishing the mean annual amount of
 heat received from the sun, or it may affect it by either increas
 ing or diminishing the difference between summer and winter
 temperature.
    Let us consider the former case first. The total quantity of
 heat received from the sun during one revolution is inversely
 proportional to the minor axis.
    The difference of the minor axis of the orbit when at its
 maximum and                 its
                       minimum state       excentricity       997   of                        is   as           to
 1000. This small amount                            of
                                difference cannot therefore  sensibly

the one hemisphere would be enduring the greatest extremes of
summer heat and winter cold, the other would be enjoying a

   It is quite true that whatever may be the excentricity of the
earth's orbit, the two hemispheres must receive equal quantities
of heat per annum; for proximity to the sun is exactly com
pensated by the effect of swifter motion. The total amount of
heat received from the sun between the vernal and autumnal
equinoxes is the same in both halves of the year, whatever the
excentricity of the orbit may be. For example, whatever extra
heat the southern hemisphere may at present receive from the
sun during            its

    From the evidence of geology we may reasonably infer that

nearly annihilated, and were we to enjoy an equable climate

   The conditions necessary to the formation of glaciers would
be secured by a state of things the reverse of what produced the
climate of the coal-period, viz., by winter occurring when the
earth was in the aphelion of       orbit,    the time         its
                                                         greatest                 at                     of
excentricity.
   We have already seen that the direct heat during winter
would, under these conditions,        nearly one-fifth less than  be                                                          at

                                          no
rature below the freezing-point.      The low temperature           the                                              of
winter would not only prevent the melting          the ice and snow,                   of

height of summer, be almost wholly covered with frozen snow,
in some places many fathoms deep. . . . The head of the bay was
terminated by ice-clifts of considerable height; pieces of which
were continually breaking off, which made a noise like a cannon.
Nor were the interior parts of the country less horrible. The
savage rocks raised their lofty summits till lost in the clouds,
and valleys were covered with seemingly perpetual snow.        Not
a tree nor a shrub of any size were to be seen.     The only signs
of vegetation were a strong-bladed grass, growing in tufts, wild
burnet, and a plant-like moss, seen on the rocks. . . . We are
inclined to think that the interior parts, on account of their ele
vation, never enjoy heat enough to melt the snow in such quan
tities as to produce a river, nor did we find even a stream of
fresh water on the whole coast”*.
    This rigorous climate chiefly results from the rays of the sun
being intercepted by the dense fogs which envelope the island
during the entire summer; and the fogs, again, are due to the
air being chilled by the presence of the snow-clad mountains,
 and the immense masses of floating ice which come from the
 antarctic seas.  A reduction of one-fifth in the amount of heat
 received from the sun during winter would, in this country,
 produce a state of things as bad as, if not worse than that which
at present exists in South Georgia.
    Some may be apt to suppose that the presence of the Gulf
stream would under such a condition still prevent our British
seas from freezing during winter.        We may, however, remark
that it is not necessary for us to assume that our seas were frozen
during the glacial epoch. We know that the seas around Sand
wich Land, and the island of South Georgia, are never frozen,
and yet the perpetual snow descends to a lower level than it does
in Greenland or in Spitzbergen. All that seems necessary would
 be the presence of immense masses of floating ice during summer
 months, and this we should then no doubt certainly have, not
withständing the presence of the Gulf-stream.
    But if we examine the matter fully, we shall find that the
 Gulf-stream as well as the climate is affected by the change in
 the excentricity of the earth’s orbit.
    It is now generally admitted that the cause of the great oceanic
 currents is the constant impulse of the trade-winds on the sur
 face of the ocean.   The trade-winds, on the other hand, owe their
 existence to the difference of temperature between the equatorial
 and polar regions of the globe.     Now any cause which tends to
 increase or diminish this difference will, other things being
 equal, tend also to increase or diminish the strength of these
 aërial currents.    The general tendency of the under currents of

the atmosphere is to pass from the polar to the equatorial regions.
We have already seen that, as the excentricity of the earth's orbit
increases, the severity of the winter in the one hemisphere is
augmented, while that in the other hemisphere is diminished.
The glacial epoch, as we have already found, probably occurred
in Europe at the time when the winters in the northern hemi
sphere were at their severest, and those in the southern hemi
sphere at their mildest condition. The great accumulation of ice
and snow in the northern regions, arising from the severity of
                                to its
the seasons, and    comparative absence      the southern hemi       in

the consequence would                     be
                         that the aërial currents from the north
would        stronger than those from the south.

Cape    ofGood Hope, where          joins the third southern current,

138       Prof. Stefan on the Dispersion of Light by Quartz,
larization may be exhibited in the following manner:—Polarized
light is passed through the rotating medium, made to fall upon
a conical mirror, which serves as an analyzer, and projected upon
a screen placed perpendicular to the axis of the mirror.               The
white light falling upon the cone appears spread out into a
coloured fan. Or a plate of calcareous spar is introduced into a
polarizing apparatus, so that the ring-like figures appear small
 and near the centre of the field, whilst the black cross is spread
 over the whole field. If the pencil of rays, where it consists of
 parallel rays, be passed through a plate of quartz cut perpen
 dicular to the axis, then the black cross just mentioned will be
 transformed into a coloured fan.
     The occurrence of dispersion through refraction, or through
 alteration of the plane of polarization, leads to the conclusion
 that in the one case the refractive index, and in the other the
 angle of rotation is a function of the length of the undulations
 of a colour. Each colour is determined by the length of the
 undulations, also by the refractive index, or by the angle of rota
 tion in a given substance.         There must therefore be a connexion
 between the two last-named quantities.              This connexion may
 be disclosed by a prismatic analysis of the light as it leaves the
 polarizing apparatus.
     The rotation of the plane of polarization is proportional to
 the thickness of the plate of quartz.           When the latter is con
  siderable, then the amount of rotation for the different colours
  is equal to several complete revolutions. When the polarizer
  and analyzer are placed parallel, the latter removes from the
 light coming through the quartz                       all
                                                coloured rays which have
  undergone rotations which are odd multiples                90°.        the

nature of the substance forming the prism, and upon the thick
ness of the rotating plate. For a prism made of crown glass the
following propositions may be deduced from the measurements:—
   1. The dark bands of the spectrum are equidistant.
  2. The distance between two contiguous bands is inversely
proportional to the thickness of the quartz plate employed.
  3. The bands move regularly and correspondingly on turning
the  analyzer.
   Since the dark bands answer to colours of which the angles
of rotation differ by a constant quantity, it follows that the
distances of the colours in the spectrum are proportional to the
differences of their angles of rotation.
   By the refractions in the prism, the directions of propagation
of the coloured rays, and by rotation in the quartz, their direc
tions of vibration are spread out so as to form a fan.          The ar
rangement of the colours follows the same law in both fans.
   On calculating the refractive indices of the individual dark
bands, the following law is arrived at:-Equal differences of re
fractive index correspond to equal differences of rotation. Angle
of rotation and refractive index are therefore in linear con
nexion; consequently both are similar functions* of the length of
the undulations.
   Making the reciprocal squares of the lengths of the undula
tions abscissae and the indices of refraction ordinates, then, ac
cording to Cauchy’s law of dispersion, the terminal points of the

not equidistant, but approach one another quite close at the

142          M. Secchi    on   Earth Currents, and their
   The conclusions to be drawn from this Table are obviously
the following:—
   (1) The fluctuation of the current in the direction of the ver
tical (or equatorial) is greater than in the direction of the meri
dian.
   (2) The maximum of the one corresponds to the minimum
of the other, so that the two periods are almost complementary;
thus the maximum of the equatorial is about 8 o'clock, and
the minimum of the meridian is at 7 o'clock, or 7.30; the equa
torial minimum is midday, and the meridional maximum between
11 o’clock and midday.     I say between these limits, because as
the observations were not always made exactly at the hour, in the
mean these fractions of an hour were reduced to the nearest
entire hour, which is adequate in this matter.
   (3) Besides the principal maxima and minima, there are,
after  midday, other but more feeble secondary maxima and
minima, in which the same law of complement prevails as
that observed in the morning.
   (4) During night the current is almost constant, but higher.
   From the nature of these results, it appeared impossible to
attribute these currents to thermal actions, from whatever point
of view they are regarded.        But these results give a valuable
clue to the   discovery  of the source of these variations, and show
that it is sufficient to compare the period of the current in one
direction to obtain that of the other; and thus our researches may
be utilized although made solely in the direction of the meri
dian.
   The three following Tables condense the observations made
during one year in the meridional terrestrial current from Rome
to Anzio, and  I    compare it with those of the bifilar and of atmo
spheric electricity.  I    do not add the periods of the declino
meter and of the vertical, because they are simpler and better
known. The minimum of the vertical is between 11 o’clock
and midday; that of the declinometer according to well-known
laws.    The maxima of the vertical are the morning and the
evening, after which there is a feeble nocturnal minimum.
What most affects the bifilar is that        itsperiod changes with
the   season,so       in
                   that      winter the minimum after midday dis
appears.

    Here the last column contains the mean temperature of each
 month, and a proportional correction of 0.9 must be applied for
each degree of thermometric variation.      But even after this cor
rection the months of November and December are signalized
by an enormous increase in the absolute value of the horizontal
                           I
component, which can also verify in the observations of Lisbon,
               I
and which think general, and which has obliged us to change
the scale.                                                                                                            <U+017F>:
   As regards the diurnal variation, the minimum is seen to
correspond to the maximum of the equatorial current, and in
the summer season the two instruments exhibit after midday
a secondary oscillation which disappears in winter.
   Lastly, I shall adduce the results of the atmospheric electri
city obtained with the moveable conductor in the same period of
observations.       I
                   must first remark that for their absolute value
the numbers must be referred to the unit of measure in the last
column, dividing them by this number. M. Wolpicelli, in a Note
printed in the Comptes Rendus, has said that our apparatus con
tains a long wire covered with gutta percha, which being agi
tated might falsify the indication.   That is not correct; for the
communication between the conductor and the electrometer is
effected by a very short wire, not more than a metre, and which                                                       s

      These forms were observed         on large crystals from Ytterby,
   Sweden.     The crystals are of an opake green material, which is
  traversed by white veins: they may perhaps be only pseudomor

         Notices of Aérolites. By Nevil Story Maskelyne.
                           Kusiali, Kumaon.
    A  small but very interesting fragment of an aérolite was
sent to me a few weeks since by my friend Dr. Oldham, the
Director of the Geological Survey of India. It weighs 63 grains.
    was accompanied by the following statement from Dr. Old
|.ann :-
    “Small fragment of meteorite that fell close to Kusiali vil
lage, in the district of British Gurhwal (say 30° N. lat., 79° E.
long.). There are stated to have been eight or ten explosions
nearly half an hour before the stone fell, to have been a strong
light like burning gunpowder in the track of the stone, which
came (apparently to observers) from the north-north-west to
south-south-east.
    “The   mass is described to have fallen on an open surface of
hard gneiss-rock, and to have been shattered into fragments,
none of which were larger than the piece        I send, most of them
much smaller.”
    The fall took place a few minutes before 5 o'clock A.M., on
the 16th of June 1860.
    Dr. Oldham adds that there was only one other specimen
preserved, and that it has unfortunately been lost. The rest of
the fragments were eagerly seized by the natives, who attribute
to these sky-stones healing properties, that recall to our minds
superstitions that have raised minerals into talismans, from the
remotest time down to our own days.         It may not be impossible,
however, that the iron that is present in these bodies in a state
of such minute division may have been found to act medici
nally as a tonic.
    The strange statement that the fall of the aërolite was pre
ceded, by so long a period as half an hour, by a series of explo
sions, is one so irreconcilable with any intelligible explanation
that should connect the two phenomena, that we may fairly hold
ourselves relieved from the attempt to supply such an explana
tion.
    The Kusiali stone is a chondrite, but it belongs to the group
of this class which is least charged with spherules.
    It is very full of the opake white flocculence which is so
abundant in some aérolites and entirely absent from others;
and in the interstices of this confused aggregate of mineral are
seen crystalline granules that are sometimes        complete crystals,
but oftener without    any  geometrical   form that can be traced.
These generally seem to be olivine, but they are also sometimes in
bars, and have occasionally the divergent structure, features which
I  take to be, in these as in similar cases, characteristic of the au

gitic and felspathic ingredients of the aërolite. The Labradorite
crystals in some Melaphyrs, and especially in a specimen from
Darmstadt (among several that M. Kesselmeyer was so good as
to forward to me), present a remarkable similarity to some of
these bacillary acrolitic minerals, and are similarly associated
with a white nearly opake body.
   The section of the Kusiali meteorite is sprinkled with small
iron-particles, and by Troilite in a somewhat smaller amount.

        Among the recent acquisitions made to the Collection of
 Meteorites in the British Museum is a stone presented by Tho
 mas Maclear, Esq., Astronomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope.
    This unique little aérolite was accompanied by a document in
 Persian, which was “a copy of the original in the intelligence
department of the district of Sandee in the Elakar or country
 of Aga Mirza (in the kingdom of Oude), dated 2nd of Zeekad,
 1253 higree, corresponding with January 29, 1838.”

150                       Dr. Joule           on the History     of the
 together. Spherules remarkably round, and, in section, very
 dark and brilliant, are plentifully distributed through the mass
 of the stone, and are associated with others of a lighter hue.
 The aérolite is very compact and takes a good polish. Its spe
 cific gravity is 3-63.   It contains Troilite in about an equal
 proportion in bulk to the iron, and it is similarly disseminated. In
 the microscope some of the spherules are seen to consist of the
 grey mineral, with a fan-like structure radiating from an edge or a
point external to the spherule, apparently belonging to one of
the oblique systems.     There are also the usual kinds of spherule,
in which the clear olivine-like mineral is seen forming a sort of
breccia, and engaged in a flocculent aggregate of confusedly
crystalline matter, from which a ray of polarized light emerges
without any definite plane of polarization.         Similar ingredients
fill the interspherular space, and the aspect of the aérolite in the
microscope is that of a pretty uniform mixture of this flocculent
aggregate and fragmentary but clear crystals.           There are like
wise a few crystals or broad clear bars of crystal, unlike the
ordinary olivine in their habit, but with their plane of polarization
parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the bar. It is not

       “On the Spectra of some of the Fixed Stars.” By W. Huggins,
F.R.A.S., and William A. Miller, M.D., LL.D.
    After a few introductory remarks, the authors describe the appa
ratus which they employ, and their general method of observing the
spectra   of the fixed stars and planets.        The spectroscope       contrived
for these inquiries was attached to the eye end of a refracting tele
scope of 10 feet focal length, with an 8-inch achromatic object-glass,
the whole mounted equatorially and carried by a clock-movement.
In the construction of the spectroscope, a plano-convex cylindrical
lens, of 14 inches focal length, was employed to convert the image
of the star into a narrow line of light, which was made to fall upon
a very fine slit, behind which was placed an achromatic collimating
lens. The dispersing portion of the arrangement consisted of two
dense flint-glass prisms; and the spectrum was viewed through a
small achromatic telescope with a magnifying power of between 5 and
 6 diameters.     Angular measures of the different parts of the spec
 trum were obtained by means of a micrometric screw, by which the
position of the small telescope was regulated.              A reflecting prism
was placed over one half of the slit of the spectroscope, and by
means of a mirror, suitably adjusted, the spectra of comparison were
viewed simultaneously with the stellar spectra. This light was usually
obtained from the induction spark taken between electrodes of diffe
rent metals. The dispersive power of the apparatus was sufficient to
enable the observer to see the line Ni of Kirchhoff between the two
solar lines D; and the three constituents of the magnesium group
at b are divided still more evidently *. Minute details of the methods
adopted for testing the exact coincidence of the corresponding metallic
   * Each unit of the scale adopted was about equal to reºrgth of the distance
between A and H in the solar spectrum. The measures on different occasions of
 the same line rarely differed by one of these units, and were often identical.

                   On the Spectra of           some      of the Fired Stars.                 153
lines with those of the solar and lunar spectrum, are given, and the
authors then proceed to give the results of their observations.
    Careful examination of the spectrum of the light obtained from
various points of the moon's surface failed to show any lines resem
bling those due to the earth's atmosphere. The planets Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn were also examined for atmospheric lines, but
 mone such could be discovered, though the characteristic aspect of the
 solar spectrum was recognized in each case; and several of the prin
 cipal lines were measured, and found to be exactly coincident with
 the solar lines.
   Between forty and fifty of the fixed stars have been more or less
completely examined; and tables of the measures of about 90 lines
in Aldebaran, nearly 80 in a Orionis, and 15 in 3 Pegasi are given,
with diagrams of the lines in the two stars first named. These dia
grams include the results of the comparison of the spectra of various
terrestrial elements with those of the star.           In the spectrum of
Aldebaran coincidence with nine of the         elementary  bodies were ob
served, viz. sodium, magnesium, hydrogen, calcium, iron, bismuth,
tellurium, antimony, and mercury; in seven other cases no coinci
dence was found to occur.
   In the spectrum of a Orionis five cases of coincidence were found,
viz. sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and bismuth, whilst in the
case of ten other metals no coincidence with the lines of this stellar
spectrum was found.
   6 Pegasi furnished a spectrum closely resembling that of a Orionis
in appearance, but much weaker: only a few of the lines admitted
of accurate measurement, for want of light; but the coincidence of
sodium and magnesium was ascertained; that of barium, iron, and
manganese was doubtful.         Four other elements were found not to be
coincident.      In particular, it was noticed that the lines C and F,
corresponding to hydrogen, which are present in nearly             the stars,     all
are wanting          Orionis and
                      ina            Pegasi.

   }. the concluding portion of their paper, the authors apply the
facts observed to an explanation of the colours of the stars. They
consider that the difference of colour is to be sought in the difference
of the constitution of the investing stellar atmospheres, which act
by absorbing particular portions of the light emitted by the incan
descent solid or liquid photosphere, the light of which in each case
they suppose to be the same in quality originally, as it seems to be
independent of the chemical nature of its constituents, so far as ob
servation of the various solid and liquid elementary bodies, when
rendered incandescent by terrestrial means, appears to indicate.

   “Aërial Tides.” By Pliny Earle Chase, A.M., S.P.A.S.
   The remarkable coincidence which I have pointed out * between
the theoretical effects of rotation and the results of barometrical
observations, has led me to extend my researches with a view of
defining more precisely some of the most important effects of lunar
action on the atmosphere. The popular belief in the influence of the
moon on the weather, which antedates all historical records, has
received at various times a certain degree of philosophical sanction.
Herschel and others have attempted partially to formulate that influ
ence by empirical laws, but the actual character of the lunar wave
that is daily rolled over our heads, appears never to have been inves
tigated.
   Major-General Sabine has shown that the moon produces a diurnal
variation of the barometer, amounting to about 006 of an inch at
St. Helena, which is nearly equivalent to ºr of the average daily varia
tion (Phil. Trans. 1847, Art. V.). This would indicate a tidal wave
of rather more than 1 ft. for each mile that we ascend above the
earth's surface, or from 3 to 6                ft.

   1. That in a synodical revolution of the moon, the barometer rises
regularly from the second octant, when it is the lowest, to the second
quadrature, when it is the highest, and then descends to the second
Octant.
   2. That the varying declination of the moon modifies her influence,
the barometer being higher in the northern lunistice than in the
southerm.
    The more recent and more complete observations at St. Helena
give somewhat different results, which serve to confirm the natural à
priori conviction that there are two maxima and two minima in each
month.       The means of three years' hourly observations, indicate the
existence of waves which produce in the first quarter a barometric
effect of +:004 in., in the second quarter of —-016 in., in the third
quarter of +.018 in., and in the fourth quarter of —'006 in.—
results which appear to be precisely accordant, in their general
features, with those which would be maturally anticipated from the
combination of the cumulative action of the moon’s attraction, with
the daily wave of rotation, and the resistance of the aether.
    One peculiarity of the lunar-aerial wave deserves attention, for the
indirect confirmation that it lends to the rotation theory of the aéro
baric tides, and the evidence it furnishes of opposite tidal effects,
which require consideration in               investigations     all

     In
      obtaining the above averages,                  I
                                           was obliged to interpolate for
such changes as took    place on  Sundays   or holidays, when no obser
vations were taken. The     interpolation,  however,  does not change the
general result, and on some accounts the Table is more satisfactory
than if the observations had been made with special reference to the
determination of the lunar influences, accompanied, as such a refer
ence would very likely have been, by a bias to some particular theory.
   The thermometric and barometric averages show a general corre
spondence in the times of the monthly maxima and minima,               the
correspondence being most marked and uniform at midnight, when
the air is most removed from the direct heat of the sun, and we
might therefore reasonably expect to find the strongest evidences of
the relations of temperature to lunar attraction.
   By taking the difference between the successive weekly tides, we
readily obtain the amount of barometric effect in each quarter.       The
average effect is more than three times as great in the third and fourth
quarters as in the remaining half-month,       a fact which suggests inte
resting inquiries as to the amount of influence attributable to varying
centrifugal force, solar conjunction or opposition, temperature, &c.
   Although, as in the ocean tides, there are two simultaneous cor
responding waves on opposite sides of the earth, those waves are not of
equal magnitude, the barometer being uniformly higher when the
moon is on the inferior meridian, and its attraction is therefore
exerted in the same direction as the earth's, than when it is on the
superior meridian, and the two attractions are mutually opposed.
Some of the views of those who are not fully satisfied with the prevail
ing theory of the ocean-tides, derivea partial confirmation fromthis fact.
     Ifind, therefore, marked evidences of the same lunar action on
the atmosphere as on the ocean, the combination of              attraction          its

                                           purpose now to give a short account
of  them,  to be extended and        completed   on a subsequent occasion*.
    In the first  place  it is  important   to remark that the olivine of me
teorites contains most excellent “glass-cavities,” similar to those in
the olivine of lavas, thus proving that the material was at one time
in a state of igneous fusion. The olivine also contains “gas-cavities,”
like those so common in volcanic minerals, thus indicating the pre
sence of some gas or vapour (Aussun, Parmallee).                To see these
cavities distinctly, a carefully prepared thin section and a magnifying
power of several hundreds are required.               The vitreous substance
found in the cavities is also met with outside and amongst the crys
stals, in such a manner as to show that it is the uncrystalline residue
of the material in which they were formed (Mezo-Madaras, Par
mallee).    It is of a claret or brownish colour, and possesses the cha
racteristic structure and optical properties of artificial glasses.       Some
isolated portions of meteorites have also a structure very similar to
that of stony lavas, where the shape and mutual relations of the
crystals to each other prove that they were formed in situ, on solidi
fication. Possibly some entire meteorites should be considered to
possess this peculiarity (Stannern, New Concord), but the evidence
is by no means conclusive, and what crystallization has taken place
in situ may have been a secondary result; whilst in others the con
stituent particles have         all
                                the characters    broken fragments (L’Aigle).

This sometimes gives rise              structure remarkably like that

which,      first sight, might readily

                                              mistaken for sections     meteor           of
ites. It   would therefore appear that, after the material             the me         of
teorites was melted,         considerable portion was broken
                               a                                     into small     up
fragments, subsequently collected together, and more               less consoli or
dated   by mechanical and chemical actions, amongst which must be
classed    asegregation        of
                               iron, either            in

bination with other substances.            Apparently   this breaking   up   oc
 curred    in some cases when the melted matter had become crystal
 line, but     inothers the forms          the particles lead me
                                                of                       conclude    to

   Some of the minerals in meteorites, usually considered to be the
same as   those in volcanic rocks, have yet very characteristic differ
 ences in structure (Stannern), which                           I
                                          shall describe at greater length
on a future occasion.     I will then also give a full account of the mi
croscopical structure of meteoric iron as compared with that produced
by various artificial processes, showing that under certain conditions
the latter may be obtained so as to resemble very closely some varie
ties of meteoric origin (Newstead, &c.).
   There are thus certain peculiarities in physical structure which
connect meteorites with volcanic rocks, and at the same time others
in which they differ most characteristically,–facts which            think                            I
must be borne in mind, not only in forming a conclusion as to the
origin of meteorites, but also in attempting to explain volcanic action
in general. The discussion of such questions, however, should,                                                  I
think, be deferred until a more complete account can be given of                                               all
the data on which these conclusions are founded.

author stated that, at the junction" of the calcareous rock with the
granite, the former was often more or less altered; and this appeared
to be the best proof of the Tertiary age of the latter.
   Mr. Lennox then adverted to a diagram-section of the rock
formations of Jamaica by the late Mr. Barrett (Quart. Journ. Geol.
Soc. vol. xix. p. 515), which he considered erroneous on the follow
ing grounds:—(1) he knows no section in Jamaica in which the
relation of the White Limestone to the Hippurite-limestone is seen;
(2) the White Limestone he believes to be of Miocene age; and
(3) the shaly and sandy beds represented in the section as overlying
the White Limestone he considers to be undoubtedly in infra
position.
   The author then discussed the question of the age of the White
Limestone, first on physical grounds, and afterwards palaeontolo
gically, inferring that it was decidedly of Miocene date; and in
conclusion he remarked that the White Limestone had probably
been deposited slowly in a tranquil sea, and discussed    relation                              its             to
the Tertiary beds                  of

          In page 68 of my book, with a view to a brief explanation for the
     Tyro in chemistry of what is meant by a binatomic body, a brief
     statement is made which is certainly not correct.             In point of fact
     the reaction described between Dutch liquor and water has not been
     observed; but, assuming it to take place, we have a simple expla
     nation of what is meant by a triatomic organic radical; and what
     was in my mind when writing this passage was, to speak hypotheti
     cally of the reaction, though this I find has not been done. I can
     assure the reviewer that I was not ignorant of the series of processes
     by which biniodide of ethylene is convertible into glycol, and the
     latter into the biniodide of ethylene; but the description of these
     would have been quite unintelligible to the junior student, and, at
     the same time, altogether unsuited to my introductory            chapter.
          In pages 561   and 562   I give an explanation  of Liebig's well-known
     method for the estimation of hydrocyanic acid, in relation to which
     the reviewer has the following passage        :-"It   is difficult to suppose
     that the writer of this passage has ever performed the operation he
     professes to describe, otherwise he could hardly have failed to notice
     that in reality it is the white cyanide of silver, and not the brown
     grey oxide which appears as a permanent precipitate.”              In reply to
     this commentary,        I beg to state that the inference suggested would
     be    quite erroneous. The experiment in question is one which, as a
     teacher of chemistry, I am obliged repeatedly to perform; and I may
      add that, in doing so, I have not failed to observe the white precipi
      tate of which he makes mention.         This, however, or rather the por
      tion of it which first falls, is not cyanide, as alleged in the review, but
   ,  chloride of silver, arising from the alkaline chlorides invariably pre
      sent in the ordinary solutions of soda and potash.            If the solution
      of caustic potash was absolutely pure, it appeared to me a probable
      conclusion that the precipitate would be oxide of silver, and hence
      it has been described as such; but I am now by actual experiment
      aware that this is not the case, and that, after the whole of the
      hydrocyanic acid has been converted into the soluble double cyanide,
      it may be thrown down as insoluble cyanide of silver by adding just
      as many measures (chloride being supposed absent) of the volume
2.     tric solution of nitrate of silver as have been already employed.
      The ignorance on this latter point, which I freely avow, the reviewer
      no doubt considers as quite unpardonable; but I am not without
       hope that the candid critic will feel himself at liberty to pronounce
       a more lenient judgment, the more especially as a knowledge of
       the nature of the permanent precipitate which appears in this volu
       metric process is not necessary with a view to the accuracy of the
       experiment.     Chemical reactions cannot be always predicted with
       certainty; and the charge against me simply amounts to this, that,
       not having made the trial, I did not know that the cyanide of potas
        sium of the double cyanide would be precipitated by nitrate of silver.
           The next charge preferred against me is one of rather a paradoxical
        nature, being actually that I have stated the compounds of nitrogen
        with hydrogen to be three in number, viz. amidogen, ammonia, and
        ammonium,      of which he says that “a more misleading statement
        could not easily be put before the student.”        As a further illustra

    tion of my trangressions in this direction, the offence is imputed to
    me of enumerating seven oxides of sulphur, and six of carbon.      On
    these points I decline to enter upon any defence, further than to say
    that, in the best works on chemistry recently published, precisely the
    same enumeration of these compounds has been made.           If I have
    sinned against scientific accuracy, of which I must say I am quite
    unconscious, precisely the same offence has been committed by
    modern chemists of great eminence, such as Pelouze and Fremy,
    Regnault, Miller, and several others; and I am at a loss to under
    stand why so humble an individual as myself should be singled                                          out
    for especial censure, while my distinguished contemporaries are per
    mitted to pass unscathed.    Many of the atomic groups here referred
    to have certainly not as yet been insulated, and are therefore to a
    certain extent hypothetic; but this does not appear to me to consti
    tute any sufficient reason why their constitution and properties, as
    far as these can be deduced from the known compounds in which they
    occur, should not be considered and discussed.
       Of a somewhat similar character are the remarks upon my mode
    of dealing with the compounds of carbon and hydrogen.                 In page
    502 I state that these numerous bodies form properly a part of
    organic chemistry, but that there are a few of them, in particular
    C, H, and C, H, to which the student should pay an early attention.
    Notwithstanding this distinct announcement of the plan which I                                         in
    tended to pursue, and the fact that in all almost all treatises on
    chemistry olefiant gas and marsh-gas alone are discussed in con
    nexion with carbon, the reviewer does not hesitate to use the follow
    ing language:—“From these instances it will be seen that Dr.
    Apjohn's lists of known compounds include many substances with
    which other chemists are by no means well acquainted: hence it is
    natural he should require to make room for them by ignoring sub
    stances which often receive a considerable share of attention.           Thus
    (page 502) the usual list of hydrocarbons is much curtailed.”               Of
    the tone of this extract, and there are several other passages in the
    review on a level with                 it,    do

 I am also quite aware that the spelling of the names of foreign che

 rendered faulty.  These errors, however, are,  believe, of small con               I

 volume extends to about 500 pages, and that, from much preoccu
 pation of time by other duties, I was unfortunately unable to pay
sufficient attention to the correcting of the press.      Such as they are,

detection), have been carefully noted by myself and others (I have

    “To  account for the production of heat and light during com
bustion,   Lavoisier had recourse to Black's theory of latent heat.
Heat is always evolved when a substance, without change of form,
passes from a rarer into a denser state, and also when a gas be
comes liquid or solid, or a liquid solidifies, because a quantity of heat
previously combined or latent within it is then set free. Now this
is precisely what happens in many instances of combustion.             Thus
water is formed by the burning of hydrogen, in which case two
gases give rise to a liquid; and in forming phosphoric acid with
phosphorus, or in oxidizing metals, oxygen is condensed into a solid.
When the product of the combustion is gaseous, as in the burning
of charcoal, the evolution of heat is ascribed to the circumstance
that the oxidized body contains a smaller quantity of combined heat,
or has a smaller specific heat than the substance by which it is
produced.”
   This passage, combined with that which immediately succeeds                                                  it,

of educational manuals which, as we have already stated, enjoys the
recommendation of the Committee of Council on Education.                         On
examining the book, we found that it fell very far short of what an
introductory text-book of Chemistry ought, in our judgment, to be ;
and we felt it needful to express our opinion of it all the more em
phatically, since we thought it probable that the circumstances of                                                       its
publication would secure for                considerable circulation, quite in

dependently        of   intrinsic merits. Dr. Apjohn's statement that the
                           its
first edition    isalready nearly out           print, confirms   of      this sup                us   in
position.      We did not, however, condemn the work                     vague and                 in
general terms. We stated              clearly       we were able the grounds

                ON   THE COLOURING-MATTER       OF EMERALDS.
                         By MM. WöHLER AND      G. RosB.
       Vauquelin, after having discovered oxide of chrome in the eme
   rald, attributed to this oxide the green colour of the stone. In 1858
   M. Lewy published very interesting researches on the deposit, the
   formation, and the composition of the emeralds of Muso in New
   Granada. His conclusion is that the colour is due to an organic
   substance, the existence of which he proved by very accurate expe
   riments.      Thus he says that the green colour disappears when the
   emeralds are heated to redness. As we were unable to verify this
   assertion in the blowpipe experiments to which we subjected the
   emerald, M. Rose and myself exposed a piece of Muso emerald, weigh
   ing 7 grammes and of a deep green colour, for an hour to the tem
   perature of melting copper. The colour did not disappear; the spe
   cimen simply became opake. Yet it had lost 1-62 per cent. of its
   weight, which agrees closely with the numbers given by M. Lewy.
   On analysis the above specimen gave 1° 186 per cent. of its weight
   of oxide of chrome. M. Lewy thinks that such a small quantity of
   oxide is insufficient to communicate so pronounced a tint to eme
   rald.
       To settle this question, we melted 7 grammes of colourless glass
   with 13 milligrammes of oxide of chrome. We thus obtained a trans
   parent homogeneous glass of a green colour, identical with that of
   the emerald analyzed.        Hence it seemed proved that 13 parts of
   oxide of chrome are sufficient to communicate a very deep green
   colour to 7000 parts of a silicate, and we do not hesitate to assume
   that the colour of emerald is due to oxide of chrome, without, how
   ever, contesting the existence of an organic substance in this mineral.

             RESEARCHES ON THE RESPIRATION OF FLOWERS.
                                BY M. CAHOURS.
        The author gives the following summary of the results arrived at
    in the course of his researches:—
        1. Every flower left in a confined space of normal atmospheric air
    consumes oxygen and produces carbonic acid in variable proportions,
    whether the flower has odour or not.
        2. The circumstances in which this takes place being the same,
y   the proportion of carbonic acid increases as the temperature rises.
º       3. That generally for flowers gathered on the same plant, and
ki   whose weights are virtually equal, the quantity of carbonic acid pro
     duced is somewhat more considerable when the apparatus in which
     the experiment is made is exposed to light, than when placed in

168                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
complete darkness;    that nevertheless in certain cases the proportion
is virtually the same under the two conditions.
   4. When normal air is replaced by pure oxygen, the differences
 observed become much more marked.
   5. That the flower whose development is commencing, disengages
a little more carbonic acid than that which has attained its complete
development, which may be explained by a more powerful vital action.
   6. Every flower left in an inert gas disengages small quantities of
carbonic acid.
   7. We see, in conclusion, that, of the various elements constituting
the flower, the pistil and the stamina, in which the greatest vitality
resides, are those which consume the greatest quantity of oxygen, and
produce the largest proportion of carbonic acid.—Comptes Rendus,

      oN THE SPECTRAL RAY                       of THALLIUM.                    By M.      J.   NICKLÉs.

 IN metals
    a              paper
            previous               I
                            have shown that compounds of the
              have other spectra than the metals themselves.
This fact appeared to me of great importance, because by the
observation of the spectra a new method is found of recognizing
the internal structure of the hitherto unknown elements, and of
chemical compounds.                          I
                        Hence have investigated the spectra of
 all                   could procure, and   many      their com               of
   the metals which

 far   they are volatile and remain undecomposed when ade
       as
quately heated, always exhibit spectra which completely differ
from those of the metals.    The observations which have re                     I
cently made       in   this respect are communicated                     in   the following
research.

170         Prof. Mitscherlich on the Spectra of Compounds
those which,                      a deportment analogous to the alka
lies, must belong to the metals, exhibit a regular shading by
which otherwise only the spectra of the compounds are charac
terized. But the number of these sapposed new metals would
soon have reached that of those at present known.               The disco
very of such metals appeared easiest in bismuth compounds.
Two lines occurred—one which was soon ascertained to be that
 of the already known thallium, and a second near the division
77 of the scale.        By precipitations, sublimations, reductions,
and oxidations conducted in the most careful manner,                 could       I
not separate from bismuth the metal belonging to the line 77.
Subsequent investigations showed that, according to the manner
in which the spectrum was prepared, this line in the spectra of
bismuth compounds occurred or disappeared; it always occurred
when deoxidizing gases came in contact with the metal at a high
temperature, and disappeared with oxidizing gases.               The line
º
in question can be obtained quite pure when metallic bismuth
is volatilized in hydrogen and the latter is ignited.                From
        observations it follows that this line belongs to bismuth as
metal.
    I have investigated most bodies and compounds in which a
spectrum might be supposed, and by different methods, in order
to avoid the chance of obtaining mixed or erroneous spectra by
foreign influences. As a source of light,                        I
                                                     used flame and the
electrical discharge.           I
                              will briefly adduce the methods which                    I
used for obtaining the spectra, and designate them by numbers
for convenience of subsequent reference.
    1. A method which I have described in the memoir men
tioned above.      From a tube closed at the top and provided with
a  very  small  aperture   at       of
                                   lower bent end, solution continu  a
ously flows,       by                      very fine platinum wire, into
                                                   of
                   means         of a its
                                  wick
a  flame   of coal-gas,         orhydrogen; the gas emerges from                      a
narrow aperture. The liquid               question brought
                                               in                 the wick by
rapidly evaporates
                                                                                      of in
                           in
                           the flame.      Carbon does not     separate
the coal-gas;      it   prevented from doing
                         is                               the presence
                                                                 so   by
water, by which hydrogen and carbonic oxide are formed.
    2. The substances are brought into              coal-gas flame which
                                                             a
burns    inoxygen.      An  oxyhydrogen      burner     used, from whose
                                                                     is                    .
middle aperture coal-gas, and from whose external ring oxygen
issues.    Either       by
                       regulating the oxygen          the position
                                                              or        the      of
substances, they can            be
                              introduced into      reducing  a   oxidizing or
flame.   The spectrum               of
                            carbon which would here       formed            be
                                                                                      of of
disappears almost entirely,      consequence
                                          in     the formation       of
carbonic oxide, which again,      virtue   the feeble intensity
                                              in         of
its   light, does not lessen the purity                 of
                                                         the phenomena when            a
substance     to   be   volatilized      is   brought into the flame.

                                    and      of Simple        Substances.                                  171
     3. The same arrangement as the above is used, but with chlo
  rine instead of oxygen, and hydrogen instead of coal-gas in the
  burner,    The spectrum which might be formed by the union of
  these bodies is too feeble to be observed; only a very feeble
  brightness in the green is perceptible,
     4. Bromine or iodine is evaporated in hydrogen, and this is
  burnt in air or in oxygen, and the substances volatilized in them.
     5. If the substances to be investigated are combustible gases,
 they are allowed to emerge out of the middle aperture of the
 Oxyhydrogen burner instead of coal-gas, and can thus be burned
 in    air   oroxygen;
                   in      they are not combustible, they are mixed
                                    if
 with     combustible

therefore the temperature of the discharge is so lowered by the
liquid electrodes that the gases are not ignited sufficiently to
produce luminous phenomena.      The latter mode of experiment
is important, because spectra of the metals and of their com
pounds can thus be produced free from any admixture with
 spectra of the gases.
   The spectra produced by the methods described are mostly
depicted in Plates I. and             II.;
                                  the luminous parts are expressed
in as accurate    shading   as is possible by printing-ink.       The
lines  produced   by method 8 (liquid electrodes) are designated
by e in the Plates. As regards the investigations themselves I
remark as follows.
   The spectra of the compounds of copper and of bismuth can
be very conveniently obtained pure.          Chloride, bromide, and
iodide of copper, and salts of oxide of copper, such as the acetate
and nitrate, were investigated by method 6 (volatilization in the
glass tube). The spectra of chloride, bromide, or iodide of cop
per are obtained perfectly pure and very distinct by methods 3
 (Cl and H) and 4 (Br, or I, and H), using even any salts of cop
per. The spectrum of fluoride of copper is best obtained by
method 2 (H, or coal-gas, and O), using fluoride of copper and
fluoride of ammonium.      If in the latter method but little oxygen
is admitted to the   burning  gases, a new line is formed in the same
place in        all
               spectra          of
                           the copper compounds.           the tempe             If

  evident from the spectra; the spectrum of chloride of copper is
  seen very distinctly, while the spectra of bromide and of iodide of
  copper are more difficult to recognize.
     Metallic copper investigated by method 7 (solid electrodes), in
 chlorine, bromine, iodine, oxygen, and nitrogen, and in other
  gases, always gives the spectrum of copper very distinctly, and,
 further, that of the kind of gas, and in chlorine the spectrum of
  chloride of copper very feebly.
     Hence the temperature produced by the passage of the spark
 between solid electrodes is much higher than that between
 liquids, because, in the first, iodide and bromide of copper remain
 partially undecomposed, which in the latter are completely
 decomposed.
     New lines occur in these spectra which neither belong to the
  metal nor to the gas, and whose formation and origin            have not           I
  yet investigated; for the lines are mostly so obscure that a cer

  nitrate of copper,  and  iodide,  bromide,    and chloride of copper,
  examined in the different gases as solid salts by method 7, behave
  like metallic copper.

2 (H, or coal-gas, and O), by using a very small quantity of
fluoride of barium or fluoride of strontium.         The spectrum of
calcium  I  could never obtain by the flame quite free from those
of the oxide or of the haloid salt. By method 7 (solid electrodes)
the latter is obtained free from admixtures by the use of hydrogen
and metal; but at this high temperature there occur, along with
the lines which are produced in the flame, a great number of
more feebly luminous lines.         The lines which could only be
obtained   by  this method are not depicted in the spectra given.
                                 I
   In the case of barium, could free the spectrum of the oxide
from that of the metal in the same way as with bismuth;             even   I
succeeded, when         I
                       investigated nitrate of baryta or iodide of
barium by method 1 (wick of platinum wire), in producing the
spectrum of baryta in individual parts of the flame.           In order
to obtain the spectra of the oxides of the other alkaline metals,
which indeed can usually only be obtained simultaneously with
the spectra of their metals, I have used in method 1 a mixture
of nitrate of ammonia with the nitrates or a solution of the
iodides; the latter are decomposed at high temperatures, and
give the spectra of the oxides very beautifully.         In these three
metals I succeeded in obtaining the spectra of the haloid salts
free from the spectra of the oxides, and but seldom mixed with
those of the metals. The chlorine compounds have been investi
 gated by method 1 (wick of platinum wire), and by method 3
 (H and Cl). It is to be observed that in the hydrochloric flame
itself they give no light at all, not even if the compound volati
lized by the hydrogen burning in air enters the flame.          This can
 only be explained by assuming that the temperature produced
by the union of hydrogen and chlorine is not high enough to
bring chlorine compounds to luminosity. The spectra of these
 compounds are obtained pure if there is more hydrogen than is
necessary for union with chlorine, which free hydrogen burning
 in the air produces      higher temperature.

                                     as each
spectrum   of the metal and that of the oxide.
   In the same paper, by the experiment in which when chloride of
potassium is brought into a flame with much chloride of ammo
nium no spectrum is perceived, I have shown that under certain
circumstances metallic compounds of the first order, even when
volatile, may give no spectra.   This is confirmed by the fact that
even the yellow colour of the sodium flame almost disappears if a
flame containing sodium is brought over strongly volatilizing sal
ammoniac,-and further by the fact that if any sodium, lithium,
or potassium compound is investigated by method 3 (H and
Cl), not even a coloured flame, and still less a spectrum, is
formed. The result is similar if compounds of the alkalies are
volatilized in burning sulphuretted hydrogen; it can be dis
tinctly observed that the interior core retains       colour per     in
                                                                                its

burned with traces of phosphorus; if more phosphorus is used,
much phosphoric acid is formed, which separates as ignited

of  cyanogen  and ammonia: the first is already known, but not
in a state of purity; the lines of the carbon spectrum which
result from the decomposition of cyanogen when burnt in hydro
gen have been assigned to the cyanogen spectrum; the spec
trum of ammonia has recently, during my research, been depicted
by M. Dibbits.       It is interesting to recognize again in the
spectra of both compounds the properties of the simple sub
stances resembling them.       While ammonia always appears with
more or less intensity in the spectra of        compounds and thus            its
behaves like the metals, cyanogen, like iodine, bromine, &c.,

     If the spectraare compared with one another, it is found that
the metallic spectra consist of individual sharp lines, and that those
of their compounds with the metalloids (excepting the haloid salts
of calcium, strontium, and barium, whose spectra consist of                                                      indi
vidual lines) are composed of broad luminosities with narrow
dark lines which recur at definite intervals.          -
   By means of that property, the spectra of the haloid com
pounds of calcium, strontium, and barium are readily compared
with each other; and it is at once observed that individual
characteristic lines recur in the spectra of one and the same
metal, which, according to the halogens, are more or less distant
from one another, by which means the metal is easily recognized

The equation for the position                      of   the lines iodide of calcium        of                    is
as follows,     if
             the distance                    of   the line nearest the  starting-point
from the starting-point                 is   9=y:—

                        and of Simple Substances.                    185
   Distance of the first chloride-of-calcium line from the
          starting-point                                         2.5
    Distance of the first iodide-of-calcium line from the         y

           starting-point
                from which y=1.
Hence the distance of the first iodide-of-calcium line would be
near the division 128-8, and the other near 126.3. The position
of the third line close to 128.8 might be directly determined
from the position of the line corresponding to it in the chloride
of-calcium spectrum; it must be near 128-6.
    The observations of the fluoride-of-calcium spectrum do not
agree with the calculations.        By calculation from the same equa
tions as in the case of iodide of calcium, the distance, for instance,
of the two extreme lines of the fluoride of calcium would amount
 to 9 degrees, while from observation it is 22 degrees.            From
 calculation from other     equations  these lines must be about 117
 and 126; in the spectrum observed they are, on the contrary,
 at 102 and 124.
    In the    spectra of the haloid salts of strontium there is the
 same   behaviour as in those of calcium.
     Calculating from the distance of the extreme sharp lines of
 bromide of strontium those of the corresponding lines of chloride
 of strontium, taking the atomic weights of chloride of strontium
 at 79-6, of bromide of strontium 1238, the distance of these
                          i.
 bromide-of-strontium lines from one another        being 6-5, the equa
                                                 -

                   %
  From the drawing a also = 10.
     Proceeding as with calcium, the starting-point calculated from
  both spectra gives the following equation:-
     Distance of the first chloride-of-strontium line from
           the starting-point                                   94-05
     Distance of the first bromide-of-strontium line from         y

     Distance of the second chloride-of-strontium line from

      Distance of the second bromide-of-strontium line from y      +6.5
            the starting-point
                 from which y=09.
   Hence the starting-point lies near the division 1384.

                       and   of Simple Substances.                   "             187
point on the barium spectrum, that             I
                                         could observe a distinct
line in the spectrum of this metal. This line only becomes
visible by methods 6 and 7 (electricity), or by bringing barium
compounds into the flame of cyanogen burning in oxygen.
   Such a relation, as in the case of calcium, strontium, and
barium compounds, could not be discovered in the other metals.
Similarity in the spectra of the compounds of a metal is easily
seen in the case of copper—for instance, in the violet part of the
bromide- and chloride-of-copper spectrum, and in the green part
of the chloride-, bromide-, and iodide-of-copper spectrum; but no
relation could be established between these spectra and the other
properties of the compounds.
   As there are resemblances in the spectra between individual
compounds of a metal, so there are such between compounds of
different metals with oxygen.    Most striking is the resemblance
between the spectra of lime and of strontia; the individual parts
correspond to each other, but the lime spectrum is more extended
than that of strontia.
   The spectra of baryta and oxide of lead are also very similar
in certain respects. This similarity is difficult to express in the
drawings, while it is very striking to the sight.
   Relations between these spectra and the atomic weights      have            I
not as yet been able to establish, but it may be expected that
such exist.
  I have not been able to find properties of the spectra of the
metals which enable a connexion of the metals with one another
to be recognized:  similarity of individual spectra together with
similar properties of the metals seems to point at such a con
nexion; thus, for instance, the spectrum of zinc is very like
that of cadmium.
   The metalloids show the same spectra, provided with regular
shading, as the metallic oxides; and         if,
                                              for instance, the spectrum

have noticed   as   existing   between the    spectrum       oxide     leadof
and   of  baryta. The oxides      of both these metals are decomposed
 by   high temperatures, and show individual lines                   as

    From this it would follow that iodine at ordinary temperatures,
 and iodine at the temperature of hydrogen flame, must be con
 ceived as two different compounds, because the spectrum of
 iodine formed at ordinary temperatures is different from that pro
 duced by the hydrogen flame.          A compound of hydrogen with
 iodine in this flame cannot be the cause of            because the same      it,

minerals to which I have had access are, with one single excep
tion, optically biatrial.  The species that exhibit this character
the most  clearly are Cromfordite (muriocarbonate of lead), Scheel
ites of various localities, hyacinth-zircon from the neighbour
hood of Schandau in Saxony, different Wulfenites, and mellite.
The biaxial character is exhibited strongest in a meionite from
Monte Somma (in others it is comparatively very weak), and in
the yellowish zircon from Ceylon.       That apophyllites are opti
cally biaxial was established by Sir David Brewster more than
twenty years ago. The observations upon mellite were made by
M. Reich, Superior Councillor of Mines, and by M. Jenzsch,
Councillor of Mines, quite independently of each other.
   The one single exception is Matlockite, which is optically uni
axial. There is also a green uranite, which is so feebly biaxial
that many an observer might take it for uniaxial.         .
   In the rhombohedral      system  pretty  much the same holds
good. Tamarite (copper mica), dioptase, the majority of cal
cites, Smithsonite, most apatites, nepheline, most quartzes (pro
bably all), beryl, phenakite, spartalite, Greenockite, and so forth,
are optically biaxial.    Mimetite from Johanngeorgenstadt is as
clearly and strongly so as many a biaxial mica is (Muscovite).
   That biaxial quartzes are met with was already known, -
                                                                 and
the same is the case with respect to beryl.
             I
   As far as have proceeded as yet in the determination of the
angles of the crystals, not only in the optically uniaxial crystals
of the cubic system, but also in the optically biaxial crystals of
the pyramidal and rhombohedral systems, those deficiencies of
symmetry may be shown to occur to which attention was directed
  y me some years ago.
   When in the course of last year M. de Kokscharow witnessed
in so marked a manner, while with me, the biaxial character of
various idocrases, he, of his own accord, observed that he would
repeat his measures of that class of crystals.   The manganesian
idocrase from St. Marcel in Piedmont is        optically    the most
remarkable.

attraction and repulsion upon other molecules. In seeking for
this, the most philosophical course that can be pursued is to
follow out to their legitimate conclusions the general principles
already laid down. We have admitted the existence of a subtile
aether, attracted by              all
                         bodies, and pervading their interstices;
now     bodies attract this aether, the atoms
       if                                         which they are                     of
composed must exert                    an
                           attractive action upon     Every atom                          it.
must therefore             be
                  surrounded with      athereal atmosphere, con    an
densed upon            its
                 surface, and extending indefinitely outward.
Again,     conceded that the electric aether
                is                             fluid,     exists,                   or           if   it
        be it                     by
 must        attracted       ordinary matter; but          this attraction           if
 subsists   itmust           be
                         exerted                  by
                                      the individual atoms, and there
 fore every atom must also                    be
                                    surrounded with         atmosphere                   an                     of
 electric aether—an electric atmosphere,            may       termed. Weasit               be
 must suppose that the interstices between the atoms              this elec                      of
 tric  atmosphere    will            be
                              pervaded                        by
                                             the more subtile aethereal
 atmosphere.       We are thus led       conceive      tomolecule      con      of  a                     as
 sisting    of   an
                  atom surrounded with two atmospheres, aethereal
 and electric—the former being the more attenuated, and perva
 ding the other. We may suppose either that these two aethers
 exercise    nodirect action upon each other, or, what           more pro                       is
 bable, that the electric atoms attract the aethereal, and are there
 fore surrounded, like the central atoms             the molecules, with     of
 aethereal atmospheres.       To this supposed fact we may attribute
 the mutual    repulsion   subsisting  between the electric atoms, and
 thus restrict the fundamental property           repulsion              of
                                                                 the atoms                      to
 of the universal aether.
    The conception here formed                           of
                                             molecule involves the idea
of  the operation          of
                        the two forces                      of a
                                            attraction and repulsion:                                           a
 force of  attraction     exerted
                                is                  by
                                       the atom upon each          the two                       of

 between the atoms                of
                            each atmosphere.     These we regard        the                                as
primary forces        nature, from which
                       of                                          all
                                               known forces are derived.
They determine primarily the physical relations               the atom                     of                   to
 its atmospheres.          seeking for the molecular actions that may
                                In
result from their operation, there are two different routes that
may    be  taken. We may conceive that the atmospheres sur
rounding each atom are naturally               condition     statical equi
                                                            in a                          of
librium, and that the primary forces with which the molecule
invested take effect                   all
                               distances, without the intervention
                                  at                                                                            of is

or  we may conceive the natural equilibrium                the molecular             of

consequence,      recurring   impulses,  both attractive and     repulsive,
are propagated outward                       by
                                   the surrounding aether from each
molecule, and take effect upon other molecules.          Here,      before,                          as

we shall follow the indications of existing science, which, as will be
generally conceded, point to a dynamical origin of the molecular
forces.   The ideas we have thus been led to form with regard
to the real nature and mode of action of these forces are as
follows.
    The molecular forces consist of
    1. A repulsive action of the electric atmosphere of                                 a molecule
exerted primarily upon the electric aether immediately exterior
to   it.This force    repulsion
                             of    made up      recurring impulses,
                                                    is              of
which are propagated       waves through the circumambient elec
                                      in
tric aether. These impulses fall upon the electric atmospheres
of contiguous molecules, and are thence propagated down         the                              to
surfaces    the central atoms, and take effect upon these
                 of                                           force                         as   a
of repulsion.
     2.An attractive action exerted            the central atomby     the                        of
molecule upon the electric aether surrounding              originating       it;
series     of
           successive contractions                       of
                                          this atmosphere, and thus                                       of a
inward-acting impulses, which are propagated outward and form
a  set    attractive waves. These are received, like the repulsive
           of
impulses, upon the surfaces            contiguous electric atmospheres,
                                                    of
and propagated        the central atoms, upon which they take effect
                            to
as    an
       attractive force.     The recurring contractions        the atmo             of
sphere here supposed                   do
                                 not necessarily imply that the force
which produces them acts                        by
                                     impulses, for every such contrac
 tion must   develope     resistance,
                                  a    which will occasion   subsequent            a
 expansion; and,        the same
                             at     time,  recurring  expansions  should
 result from the similar impulses propagated from surrounding
molecules.   The electric atmospheres that envelope the atoms                                             of
bodies may  accordingly           perpetual dynamical condition
                                           be   in   a
of alternating contractions and expansions,           alternating            or    of
inward and outward movements          their atoms, although the
                                                          of
primary forces acting upon these atoms should                                 be   continuous             in
their action.
     But   we confine our attention         the action       single atom
                                                              to              of

 which     necessity follow the    contractions,   must        less extent    be    of
 than the contractions; for        part         a             of
                                             the contractile force     ex                            is
 pended     impelling
                 in        portiona                  of
                                        the universal aether  compressed
 upon the surface       the central atom normally outward from this
                             of
 surface.   To the extent that this takes place will the contraction
 of the atmosphere exceed the expansion which immediately fol
 lows      it,
          and          an
                   effective attractive force       propagated through

 the surrounding electric aether. We are thus led      recognize
 the existence     third molecular force, viz. force
                        of  a                           repulsion        a              of to

    3. A third molecular force, then, consists of a series of repul
 sive or outward-acting impulses imparted to the universal aether
   at the surface of the atom of a molecule by the contractile force
                                                               This repul
                                                           to its
  exerted by the atom upon           electric atmosphere.
                                    in its
   sionis  equal,         origin,
                               at     the attraction which developes                                                           it.
It    is propagated       waves which, unlike the waves conveying the
  other molecular forces, proceed through the universal aether.
  These waves,        each contraction
                            if              the atmosphere were not fol    of
  lowed      bypartial
                   a    expansion,  would         the character     “waves      be   of                        of
 of   translation,” and would convey only outward-acting impulses;
 they are,       fact, oscillatory waves,
                    in                         which the outward predo          in
  minate over the inward       acting-impulses.
      The force thus originating may            regarded      the primary       be                   as
 force     of
            heat, and may                        be
                                 termed heat repulsion.    The other two
 molecular forces may          designated      be
                                              the forces    electric attrac     as                  of
 tion and electric repulsion.       But they should not        confounded                            be
 with the special electric forces that come into play whenever the
 natural quantity          electric aether associated with atoms,
                                      of                                                                                      or

 connexion.
     The molecular forces that have now been specified might                                                                   be

gravitation, which cannot be found, primarily, in any supposed
motion of gross atoms in an isolated condition.    It should be
observed, too, that the dynamical condition of atmospheres here
considered is really a necessary consequence of the first opera
tion of the force of attraction of atoms upon the surrounding
ather, if the elasticity of the aether be perfect.
   A different view of the possible nature and origin of the mole
cular forces from that which has been given, may be obtained
by changing our stand-point.
   We may conceive the same three forces, viz., one of attrac
tion, and two of repulsion, to be in operation, but we may re
place the forces of electric attraction and repulsion by equivalent
forces propagated through the universal aether.        This may be
realized as a physical conception by regarding the atoms of the
molecules and those of the surrounding electric aether, each en
compassed by          its
                    aethereal atmosphere,     being,     rather their
                                                                  as              or
atmospheres,      the dynamical condition
                  in                                               of
                                               alternate contraction
and expansion, and thus          being centres from which proceed
                                         as
oscillatory waves, and that,      the result, asaccordance with the    in
general     theory    so    ably advocated              by
                                      Professor Challis, the elec
tric atoms    two atmospheres may repel each other, and the
                 of
central atoms which they surround may also repel each other;
the general result being that similar atoms repel, and dissimilar
attract.   Upon this view the forces we have deduced from the
dynamical state         of
                    the electric atmospheres, which must still                                          be

   The preceding Table contains the results of numerous calcula
tions made after this manner, in which k stands for                                  r2"
   From these results it appears that for values of                                  ;    greater than
 4.938, or thereabouts,                               of the effective
                                       there are two alternations
force f as the distance          the molecular atmospheres increases
                                      between
 indefinitely from zero.  The first is from a repulsion to an attrac
tion; the second is from an attraction to a repulsion. The re
pulsion which becomes effective beyond the limit of the attrac
tion at first increases, and then decreases, extending to an inde
finite distance.               If   the    ratio    ;   be less than about 4.938, the
effectiveaction                              upon each other will be

atmospheres,        should also tend to diminish the ratio of n to m,
and therefore to modify in          a   similar manner the matural curve
of molecular action.                                                                     -
    Itis easy to see that a similar curve will also serve to repre
sent the mutual actions of dissimilar molecules, which obtain
when a chemical union is formed between two different sub
stances.    But in this case a force of electric attraction not yet
considered may come into play.
   The general principle of two alternations of the effective action
of molecules, to which we have been theoretically conducted, is
distinctly recognized as a physical fact in the three different
states of aggregation of matter—in the molecular attraction
and repulsion manifest in solids and liquids, and in the mutual
repulsion subsisting between the same particles when widely
separated in the vaporous condition.      It will be seen hereafter
that the law of molecular action, as portrayed in the curve
shown in fig. 1, furnishes, in the probable variations of the ratio
*     an adequate general cause for the varied results                  of this action
exhibited in the different properties of substances; and at the
same time reveals the probable explanation of many physical
and chemical phenomena occurring at surfaces of contact, and
of the dependence of these phenomena upon temperature and
other circumstances, as in oxidation, combustion, &c.

XXIV.        On the Conditions of Stability of thin Films of Liquids;
        a Report by Professor PLATEAU on a Memoir by Professor
        LAMARLE of Ghent”.

    IN Equilibrium

                   of   Liquid Mass without Weight”t,
                                      a                                                          I have
    established,in part experimentally and in part theoretically, the
    laws which relate to films terminating in a common liquid edge,
    and to liquid edges which meet at the same liquid point.    From
    these laws       I
                   drew the conclusion, which                    I
                                                     have tried to confirm
    by experiment, that every equilibrated system of films in which
    they are not fulfilled is an unstable system, and             ended this          I
    series  by  saying:—
        “I  will return once more to systems of films, in order to con
    sider the theory of them from a more general point of view. In
    fact, as     I
                 have already observed, the liquid films of which they
    are made up may be compared to stretched membranes, and
    hence it will be seen that each system will arrange itself so that
    the sum of the surfaces of all its films will be a minimum.          But
    I  reserve this  point for a future Series.”
        In expressing myself thus, my intention simply was to take
     as examples certain particular systems of films, which from their
     simplicity are capable of being made the subjects of direct cal
     culation, and to show that the sum of the surfaces of the films is
     a minimum relatively to some one mode of deformation; but I
     had no intention of treating the problem in              generality, all   its                    for
I      did not consider      practicable

  He begins by establishing, more definitely than had done, the                        I
above-mentioned principle of the minimum; and then, starting
from this, he discusses the case of films meeting at the same
liquid edge. He supposes any number of plane films starting
  rom solid edges and   uniting    one common liquid edge, and
                                     all                 in

 M. Lamarle then shows that all these results extend         the films
 themselves,         all

 the areas requires that these films should meet three           three                                  by

 films more than three films never meet               the same edge, and in
 that these always make equal angles with each other—is thus
 completely demonstrated, and appears                 consequence
                                                                    as

                                                    the conditions which
  these films must satisfy        order that they may meet three

are spherical polygons having angles of 120° exclusively.    M.
Lamarle points out in the first place that these polygons can
only be either triangles, four-sided figures, or pentagons, and
hence he derives one analytical relation between the respective
numbers of these several kinds of polygons and the total number
of films; a second relation he finds in the fact that the sum of
the surfaces of             all
                     the polygons must make         the whole surface                up
of  the sphere; lastly, these polygons must              simple juxta            all   be
position, without encroaching upon each other              some places                      in in
and   leaving  empty   spaces      other  places.   at
                                                    From these three
conditions, M. Lamarle deduces that there are only seven possi
ble combinations        films starting from the same point, and
                                  of
joined together three                     by
                            three under equal angles.
     If,   in
          each     these combinations, the sides

   Now M. Lamarle proves that for each     these systems                             of                              of
films, except that      the regular tetrahedron,

conceive such    mode      adisplacement that, from its commence

of the films will result from it: the  system    the regular tetra                of
hedron,     which not more than four liquid edges meet
                in                                              the                                            at

therefore the only one      these which canof     stable.  Hence,                     be
when the films are plane,  the liquid edges which meet    any one                                     at
liquid point are necessarily four        number and make equal      in
angles with each other.    Lastly, M. Lamarle shows that the same
           applies    curved films, and,    consequence,                   by

  I     am    not  aware   when   the  water-blowing   machine   was    first
called a trompe; in neither the account given by François, nor
in Dr. Pope’s letter is the word employed, and nearly a hundred
years later Mr. Stirling gives no name to the machine; but it
was called a trompe in France long before his paper was
                                                                       pub

      Grignon* writes as follows: “Lestrompes ont tiré leurs noms
de ces météores qui portent le même nom, et dontil
                                                                  y a deux
sortes, l’une marine et l'autre terrestre: celle        qui  se forme sur
merest       une   colonne  d'eau  immense,   enlevée   par la violence du
 vent; et celle que l’on voit sur terre est formée par une tour
 billon de vent dont le mouvement est determiné par les mon
 tagnes; ce tourbillon enveloppe un nuage, le comprime et en
 forme une colonne composée d'air et d'eau qui se précipite sur
 la surface de la terre ou se brise contre un rocher.”
  : The Italian       tromba, French trombe, signifies a pump, an ele
 phant's trunk, and a trumpet, as well as a waterspout: the
  Spanish trompa signifies a trumpet, an elephant’s trunk, and a
 large top. Prof. Max Müller informs me that trompe is the old
  French form of trombe, and that Dier, in his ‘Lexicon Etymo
  logicum,’ derives trombe in the sense of trumpet from the Latin
  tuba, the insertion of the r being warranted by the analogy of
   tromar instead of tomar.
       Landais, in his ‘Dictionnaire des Dictionnaires,’ derives trombe
   in the sense of waterspout from otpéušos.              Now a Tpóp/80s
   means a top, a spindle, a round shell, and is derived from
   otpéºpo, to turn, twist, revolve.          I
                                              will not pretend to decide
   whether (adopting Dier's derivation) a trumpet and a waterspout
    were called by the same word on account of their being tubiform,
    or whether the trumpet was so named from the fact of                being     its
    the first musical instrument with       straight tubet,  and  the  water.

    plausible) the waterspout was first called               trombe (from

     shaped like

                                                      rotatory motion; and
                                            being  apparently                            up   in

 bably, from the whirling motion of the water around a conical
 cavity, which, as we shall see hereafter, is produced in the trough
 of machines similar to that mentioned by François, and in all
 machines with inclined tubes: in both these respects there is a
 resemblance to a waterspout.
    Several modifications of the trompe have been constructed
 since       its
            first invention, the main difference consisting              the                                           in

so greatly accelerated by gravity, that the cohesion of two con
tiguous cross sections of the jet is destroyed, and the jet, ceasing
to be continuous, breaks up into separate masses of water. We
observe, moreover, that when the continuity begins to be broken,
particles of water are thrown out from the centre stream and
move downwards in a gradually diverging line inclined at a small
angle to the main stream.         Now when such a stream passes
downwards through a long vertical tube, the area of the cross
section of which is not many times as great as that of the
orifice from which the stream issues, we find that at a certain dis
tance from the orifice the quantity of spray thrown off from the
stream which reaches the sides of the tube is so great that, by
the adhesion of the water-particles to the glass, the whole stream
 is dragged to the sides of the tube; it is not, however, dragged
 to one side of the tube, as would be the case if the jet were not
 perfectly vertical, but it is evenly and equally spread out in a
dome shape, and for the rest of                 its

       No one who has fired a gun into water can have failed to
    observe the numberless bubbles of air which rise to the surface
    for a few seconds after the penetration of the shot. Each shot
    ploughs for itself a channel, into which air enters, is enclosed by
    the water, and penetrates to a greater or less depth according as
    the velocity of the shot is considerable or otherwise,
       Let us now pass on to the experiments made with the appa
    ratus described above.
       The number of seconds required by half a litre of water to
    flow from the delivery-tube H, and the number of seconds
    required by that water to carry down half a litre of air, being
    determined in the manner stated above, the number of cubic
    centimetres of air carried down by half a litre of water could
    obviously be readily calculated.  Each of the results given below
    is the mean of several  determinations—generally    of ten, except
    in those cases in which four or five consecutive determinations
º   gave absolutely similar results.

  In the first and second experiments, in which the resistance
was least, we see that half a litre of water carried down 615
cubic centims. of air, a quantity (with one exception) more than
 three times as great as that carried down in any of the other ex
 periments given above. The                        air
                                          escaped from        with perfect regu

short distance into the water; but if we make such an arrange
ment that we have a vessel perpetually emptying itself by a long
tube, air enters by the conical cavity, is detached from the apex
of the cone, and passes down the tube with the descending water.
   In order to determine the amount of air carried down by this
means, I fitted a small funnel N, fig. 1, into the upper orifice of
the tube B, and placed the delivery-tube H in such a position
that the water which it delivered impinged against the side of
the funnel.    This being the case, a hollow cone of water possess
ing rapid rotatory motion was formed in the funnel, and air
entered through               its
                      centre: the air and water          issuing from                   on
the funnel formed alternate disks      the tube     and these rapidly

                                  *
   “Although experiment shows that wire gauze can cool the     a
gaseous products             of

                                       at      the   question arises,
A onwhat does this action depend.    Several things are possible.
   cold wire gauze introduced into the flame can take away heat.
But the cooling thus produced less the higher the tempera

the outside the heat   receives from the flame.
                             it                     Such    loss can                         a
occur either       by
                 conduction        radiation. or   by

Hence   it    probable that the wire gauze loses heat more
             is                                                                                               by
radiation than          by
                   conduction.
   “The assumption that metal gauze radiates more heat than the
gaseous flame         matter
                       is   a    course, for we know that ignited
                                              of
 solid bodies radiate more light than gaseous bodies        the same                        at

 publication      Magnus's interesting experiments

 228       M. Buchner     on the Purification   of Sulphuric Acid.
 plain the statement of Grahamº, that the wire gauze of the safety
 lamp soaked with solution of alkali becomes much more imper
 vious to the flame.
    Buchner nine years ago gave a method for freeing sulphuric
 acid from arsenic, which was based on the ready conversion of
 arsenious acid into the more volatile chloride of arsenic by means
 of hydrochloric acid, and which simply consisted in passing a
 current of HCl through heated sulphuric acid.                   Bussy and
 Buignet, and, independently of them, Bloxami, found that sul
 phuric acid could not be purified in this way from arsenic.              On
 going into the experiments of Bussy and Buignet, Buchner found
the cause to be that the arsenic was present as arsenic, and not as
arsenious acid. Now arsenic acid in solution is but imperfectly
converted into chloride of arsenic. Souchay, under Fresenius's
 direction, has recently found that from a boiling mixture of
 arsenic and hydrochloric acids very little arsenic is volatilized;
 and indeed it is on this fact that Fresenius and Babo's method
for removing, by means of chlorate of potash and hydrochloric
acid, organic matters from solutions containing arsenic is based.
   Buchner<U+017F> accordingly proposes, as a modification of his method,
to convert any arsenic acid which may be present first into arse
nious acid.     This is best effected by heating the acid to be
purified with a few pieces of charcoal; sulphurous acid is libe
rated, which in a few minutes reduces the arsenic acid so com
pletely to arsenious acid that every trace may be subsequently
removed by passing a current of hydrochloric acid through.
    Delafontaineš has determined the atomic weight of thorium,
and communicated some considerations on the formula of thoria.
Berzelius, in 1829, had found a series of numbers for the atomic
weight of thorium agreeing but imperfectly with each other, and
the mean of which (calculated according to the modern atomic
weights for sulphur, barium, and potassium; for Berzelius's de
termination was made with the sulphate of thoria and potash) is
59:38.     Delafontaine used for the preparation of thoria the
minerals thorite and orangite; and the method he used is that
employed by Marignac for the treatment of cerite.                 The pow
dered mineral was moistened with water and made into a semifluid
paste with sulphuric acid, by which so much heat was produced
as to expel most of the excess of sulphuric acid.            The residual
mass was heated until all acid was driven off. The residue was then
dissolved in cold water and filtered.      The solution was next con

without soldering, two thinner copper tubes were soldered, and
in these glass tubes were cemented.     The whole tube was placed
in a porcelain tube in a furnace, and one of the ends connected
with a hydrogen-apparatus, while the other was provided with a
long vertical delivery-tube which dipped under mercury. While

This is indicated by the manometer, which ought not to vary
appreciably when the stopcock, by which the nitrogen enters the
iron tube, is closed. At this moment (the nitrogen-stopcock
being closed) a current of hydrogen was passed into the annular
space. It was thus seen that, in proportion as hydrogen displaced
nitrogen in the annular space, the mercury ascended in the
manometer and attained such a level as to indicate that the
internal pressure had been more than doubled.        This is pure
hydrogen, which, penetrating the sides of the iron tube, adds                                                    its

of  definite composition.        Debray finds now that this transforma
tion  of  phosphates       more general than had been supposed, and
                               is
that there are few which                         do

     At a temperature of about 80°C. ammoniacal double salts are
  obtained with magnesia, cobalt, nickel, manganese, and iron in
  nacreous crystals, which have the general formula
                     2RO, NH4O, PO34-2HO.
 Zinc forms an    exception; it produces an anhydrous phosphate.

 when left in contact with a concentrated acid solution of phos

 tolerably large rose-coloured crystals of a phosphate which is also
 insoluble, and which has the composition
-
                    CoO, NH4O, HO,       PO%  +4HO.
 Phosphate of iron undergoes a similar change.
    In very acid liquids no precipitates are formed, but beautiful
crystals are obtained on spontaneous evaporation.
    With phosphate of ammonia and magnesian salts in excess
no ammoniacal phosphates are obtained, and the products vary
with the temperature.      Thus the salts of magnesia and of manga
mese  give phosphates   in the form of fine rhomboidal octahedra, of
the following composition:
       2MnO, HO, P05-H 6HO        and 2MgO, HO, P0°,+ 6HO.
    At  100° C. manganese gives a tribasic phosphate,
                        3MnO,    PO% +3HO,
which has the form of Hureaulite, and may be considered as a
variety of this mineral free from iron.
    Arseniate of ammonia gave precipitates which could not be
transformed at the ordinary temperature; but kept for several
days at 100°, well-defined crystals were obtained.     Those of zinc
and of manganese are as follows:–
       2MnO, HO, AsO3 +2HO;           22n(), HO, AsO"--2HO.
With phosphate of soda in excess and salts of the magnesian
group the products vary with the mature of the salt employed.

   M. Damour* has communicated a note on the density of
zircon. In the course of his researches on the density of minerals,
he had been led to observe the great variations in the density of
zircon, which oscillates between 4:04 and 4.67; and he set him
self to ascertain whether this arose from a difference in composi
tion, or was due to a special molecular state.          He analyzed a
specimen from Ceylon, of the specific gravity 4:183, and found
that the analytical results corresponded with the formula of zir
con, ZrO2SiO4.       Results very closely agreeing with these were
obtained by Berzelius for a zircon of Epailly which had the spe
cific gravity 4'667.
    The difference did not arise therefore from chemical composi
tion. Damour accordingly endeavoured to modify the molecular
state.   A zircon from Ceylon, whose density was 4:183, was
heated to dull redness, without, however, producing any loss of
weight or alteration in density. But heated to an incipient
white heat        its
                 density rose     4:534, there being little

           May 25, 1864.—W. J. Hamilton, Esq., President,
                              in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1.  “On   the Geology of part of the North-western        Himalayas.”
By Capt. Godwin-Austen. With Notes on the Fossils, by T.
Davidson, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., R. Etheridge, Esq., F.G.S., and
S. P. Woodward, Esq., F.G.S.
    The geological formations occurring in these regions were stated to
be (1) a fluvio-lacustrine series, (2) a Siwalik series, (3) Nummulitic
Limestone, (4) Jurassic rocks, and (5) a Palaeozoic series.       In refer
ence to the fluvio-lacustrine strata, the author gave a résumé of the
conclusions respecting their physical features and mode of formation
at which he had arrived in a former paper, and in addition gave some
details respecting their position and stratigraphical characters, espe
cially describing the mode of occurrence in them of some land and
freshwater Shells, which were referred to in a Note by Mr. S. P.
 Woodward. The lakes in which the lacustrine deposits were formed
were supposed by Capt. Godwin-Austen to have been produced in
 consequence of the mouths of valleys, into which rivers run, be
 coming blocked up by means of glaciers and otherwise, as now often
 happens in the same region. Stratigraphical details of the other series
 of rocks were then given, the Jurassic formation being supposed to
 belong to the Middle division of the Oolites, and the Palaeozoic lime
 stone being described as Carboniferous Limestone, both of which de
 terminations were confirmed by Messrs. Etheridge and Davidson in
 Notes on the Fossils.     The age of the clay-slate and mica-slate was
 stated to be very doubtful, and the author concluded by describing
 the localities in which granitic rocks occur, but chiefly as forming
 the axis of the North-western Himalayas.          In Notes appended to
 the paper, Mr. Davidson described species of Brachiopoda from
  three deposits, one of Carboniferous age, one of Jurassic, and one of
 unknown date; Mr. Etheridge described the remaining fossils from
  the Jurassic strata; and Mr. Woodward noticed the Shells from the
  fluvio-lacustrine series. While the latter were stated to be nearly
  all recent British species, Mr. Etheridge remarked on the great
  affinity of the Jurassic fossils to those of the same age (Middle
  Oolite) in England, and Mr. Davidson observed that the fossili
  ferous limestone of the Carboniferous series bore a great resem
  blance, lithologically and in its fossils, to deposits of a similar age in
  Great Britain.
      2. “On the Cetacean Fossils termed Ziphius by Cuvier, with a
   notice of a new species (Belemnoziphius compressus) from the Red
   Crag.”     By Prof. T. H. Huxley, F.R.S., F.G.S.
      The genius Ziphius, as originally constituted by Cuvier, contained
   three species described by him, namely, Z, cavirostris, Z. plani

 242                                         Geological Society.
rostris, and Z. longirostris; but it is probable that each of these really
belongs to a distinct genus—the first to Ziphius, the second to Cho
 neziphius, and the last to the author's genus Belemnoziphius.      More
recently M. Gervais has established a new species—Ziphius Becanii
—from a specimen formerly considered to belong to Z. longirostris;
and this species, with that described in this paper, and Professor
Owen's MS. species, were also considered referable to Belemno
ziphius.                                                             -
   Besides the foregoing conclusions respecting the affinities of the
fossil Rhynchoceti, Professor Huxley discussed the relations of the
recent genera and species belonging to the same group, including
the cetacean of Aresquiers, which was considered by Gervais to
belong to the genus Ziphius.        He exhibited these relations in a
tabular form, and concluded by stating that he had arrived at the
following results:—
   1. Unless the cetacean      of Aresquiers be identical with Ziphius
cavirostris, all the Ziphii of Cuvier belong to Cetacea generally
distinct from those now living.
   2. If the cetacean of Aresquiers be identical with Ziphius caviros
tris, it is not certain that the latter is truly fossil; nor, if it be so,
have we any knowledge of                        its
                                  stratigraphical position.
       Of the certainly fossil Ziphii, the stratigraphical position
                                                                                                        of of

English       Antwerp Crag, and are not known
                   or                                   occur out            to                   of

                         at                     regarding Belemnoziphius
                                                                  in

distinct from the Rhaetic beds, lithologically and palaeontologically;
and (3) from the discovery         Rhaetic fossils of   the Grey Marls       in

Microlestes or to Plagiaulaw cannot be determined; Mr. Dawkins has
therefore named it provisionally Hypsiprymnopsis Rhaeticus.   In con
clusion he traced the range of the Marsupials in space and time,
showing that of the six families into which Van der Hoeven divides the
existing Marsupials, two—the entomophagous and sarcophagous
Dasyurina, and the phytophagous Macropoda—had             been repre
sented in   England   during   the interval between the deposition   of
the Purbeck beds and that of the Rhaetic Marlstones below the
Bone-bed.
   2.   “On    the Geological Structure of the Malvern Hills and ad
jacent District.”     By Harvey B. Holl, M.D., F.G.S.
    The object of this communication was threefold, namely (1) to
 discuss the structure and origin of the crystalline rocks of the Mal
 vern Hills, (2) to give the results of an examination of the super
 posed Palaeozoic strata, (3) to state the chronological relationship
 of the several events in their geological history.
    The geological structure of these hills was described in detail,
 and it was concluded that the rocks hitherto treated of as syenite,
 and supposed to form the axis of the range, are in reality of meta
 morphic origin, consisting of gneiss (both micaceous and horn
 blendic), mica-schist, hornblende-schist, &c.,      invaded   all
                                                                 vein           by              of
 granite and trap-rocks.         was then shown that the Hollybush
                                 It
 Sandstone    is  the equivalent    the Middle Lingula-flags, and that
                                           of
 the overlying black shales correspond with the Upper Lingula-beds,
 the whole being overlain,         Wales,
                                  as   in            by
                                              Dictyonema-shales. These
 rocks,  on the east     the Herefordshire Beacon, are altered
                         of                                          trap            by
 dykes, which were shown                   be
                                       later date than those traversing
                                      to        of
 the crystalline rocks before alluded to. Allusion was next made                                to
 the Upper Llandovery strata which overlie unconformably the primor
 dial rocks just noticed, after which the several faults      the district in
 were described     indetail.
    Dr. Holl concluded with some remarks                  on
                                                  the general relations                         of
 the rocks    of the Malvern Hills with those       the surrounding dis
                                                           of
 tricts, describing the successive physical changes supposed         have             to
 been consequent upon their deposition and their subsequent eleva

axis of the temperatures in the part which corresponds to the state

   In fine, the rotatory power of substances which I have studied for
a definite ray of the spectrum is not a constant; it varies regularly
with the temperature, and changes neither direction, nor virtually
intensity, when the liquid passes into the state of vapour.
   For rays of different colours, the law of the deviation of the planes
of polarization is independent of the temperature and of the condi

 the darkening of the surface; and hence we see that the colours must
 cooperate in a definite ratio in order to excite the most favourable
 impression.
    It is well known that the imperfectly pure carthamine,which occurs
 in commerce in pink saucers, has a yellowish metallic lustre when
 allowed to dry in a saucer, and that in time it becomes greenish                                       at
 the surface. Carthamine spread upon glass plates exhibits a bronze
 like iridescence which afterwards disappears.        Dr. Stahlschmidt
 very kindly prepared for me a series of glass plates upon which pure
 carthamine was spread with the greatest possible evenness.                On                         look
  ing through one of these, the whole plate appears of a deep red.                                     On
 looking at a plate, coated on one side only, by reflected light, the
  coated side being below, the glass plate appears uniformly green
 But if the plate is reversed, so that the daylight, to which the back
 of the plate is turned, is reflected by the layer of carthamine, the                                  ob
 server would fancy he was looking at a plate of polished brass.                                         If
  carthamine is spread upon a plate of blue, yellow, red, or green glass,
 the green colour seen by reflexion in the first case disappears, but
 the metallic lustre seen in the second case remains unchanged. This
latter therefore is produced by the combination of the reflected green
 light with the internally dispersed red light.
     The reflected green light appears with increased intensity                  the              if
 plate, placed in such a position that the side coated with carthamine
 is below, is looked at through a Nicol's prism or through one of the
polarizing prisms above described (p. 247). This acts in the plane of
reflexion like a Nicol's prism perpendicularly to the principal section.

uppermost, the yellowish light gradually becomes more and more

 the darkening of the surface; and hence we see that the colours must
 cooperate in a definite ratio in order to excite the most favourable
 impression.
     It is well known that the imperfectly pure carthamine,which occurs
 in commerce in pink saucers, has a yellowish metallic lustre when
 allowed to dry in a saucer, and that in time it becomes greenish at
 the surface. Carthamine spread upon glass plates exhibits a bronze
 like iridescence which afterwards disappears.                     Dr. Stahlschmidt
 very kindly prepared for me a series of glass plates upon which pure
 carthamine was spread with the greatest possible evenness. On look
 ing through one of these, the whole plate appears of a deep red. On
 looking at a plate, coated on one side only, by reflected light, the
 coated side being below, the glass plate appears uniformly green.
 But if the plate is reversed, so that the daylight, to which the back
of the plate is turned, is reflected by the layer of carthamine, the ob
server would fancy he was looking at a plate of polished brass.                                         If
 carthamine is spread upon a plate of blue, yellow, red, or green glass,
the green colour seen by reflexion in the first case disappears, but
the metallic lustre seen in the second case remains unchanged. This                                          -
latter therefore is produced by the combination of the reflected green
light with the internally dispersed red light.
     The reflected green light appears with increased intensity if the
plate, placed in such a position that the side coated with carthamine
is below, is looked at through a Nicol's prism or through one of the
polarizing prisms above described (p. 247). This acts in the plane of
reflexion like a Nicol's prism perpendicularly to the principal section.
The cause of heightening of the colour thus occasioned                        that the      is,
light polarized        inthe plane       reflexion,

glass,  is   got rid     of.  On the contrary,         the layerif     carthamine  of                   is
uppermost, the yellowish light gradually becomes more and more
nearly green       as the Nicol       turned round. Carthamine very slightly
                                       is

I      may take this opportunity            remarking that the polarizing prism

    Telescope.   By HENRY DRAPER, M.D., Professor of Natural

 SINº.       the introduction of mirrors of silvered
        nomical uses by Foucault and Steinheil, they      have  conti
nually increased in favour, and have now assumed very consider
able importance. As a testimonial to their efficiency,    I may state
that one of 15% inches    aperture   has furnished me the means of
producing photographs of the moon 50 inches in diameter, well
defined, and   of good general effect.                            -
    My attention   was first directed to them in 1860, owing to
some remarks made by Sir       J.  F. W. Herschel to my father.      I
had at that time a reflector of   speculum-metal   of 15 inches aper
ture and 12 feet focal length, mounted in an observatory which
was described in a paper read at the Oxford Meeting of the
British Association in 1860. Soon afterwards the speculum
was replaced by a silvered-glass mirror of 15% inches aperture
and 12% feet focal length, which       I had ground, polished, and
silvered.   Since then more than a hundred mirrors have been
prepared in my workshop, in order to secure two of the highest
perfection.    The full account of these operations, illustrated by
forty-seven woodcuts, has just been published by the Smithsonian
Institution at Washington, in the ‘Contributions to Science.”
   In the past four years many opportunities have presented
themselves for learning the qualities of these instruments, what
their defects and advantages are, and the best means of con
structing them.       When the eye has become experienced in

250              Dr. H. Draper on the Photographic Use of
judging of faults, and the hand quick at correcting them, a
 short time suffices to bring the glass concave to a state of per
fection.        If
            the rough grinding be completed, and the convex
tool put into good condition, a single day should finish the
surface.
  In   the beginning of the experiments, one of the most serious
difficulties encountered was that arising from the irregular dis
tribution of heat through the mass of the disk of glass. When,
for instance, a mirror of 15% inches is polished by a pitch tool
of the same size, it is hard to avoid the production of rings of
varying focal length, owing to the overplus of heating towards
the middle. Where the tests are applied at the centre of cur
vature, and the operator does not have to depend on indications
derived from telescopic observation, these and similar imperfec
tions are much more easily detected and avoided than where
they have to be disentangled from atmospheric disturbances.
   Another obstacle, which proved to be formidable at first, was
the unequal amount of compression that disks of glass and spe
culum-metal suffer when supported on different parts of their
edges.     In        all
                 the large disks examined, there has been     dia                               a
meter      ofminimum    compressibility, which ought         kept                         to   be
always vertical.        set horizontally, the mirror immediately
                                If
gives double images.
   As regards the best machine for producing parabolic surfaces,
the experience    six yearsof    several different ones, including
                                                  on

only   byemploying polishers                           of

   Many different processes for silvering glass have been pro
posed, some requiring the aid of heat, others doing as well cold.
Those of M. Cimeg and Professor A. Martin have given the
most satisfactory results. The reducing agents are respectively
 Rochelle salt and cane-sugar (interverti).   As the formulae may
be of use to those interested in the matter, they are appended.
For silvering a 154-inch mirror, about 22 ounces of liquid are
needed.    In Cimeg’s process, 800 grains of nitrate of silver must
be dissolved in 4 ounces of water, and ammonia added until the
precipitated oxide of silver is almost redissolved.     In another
vessel, 560 grains of tartrate of potash and soda are to be placed
with 17 or 18 ounces of water.         The concave surface of the
glass must be thoroughly cleaned with nitric acid and water, and,
when dry, coated with uniodized collodion, and the film polished
off with cotton flannel. The liquids being mixed are then to be
poured into a shallow vessel of hard india-rubber, and the glass
immersed face downwards, the back standing out of the liquid
and being freely exposed to daylight or sunlight.        The same
precautions are necessary to avoid streaks as in the case of a
collodion negative.   The silver, when polished, should be about
gooºoo of an inch thick, and should show the sun by trans
mitted light as a light-blue disk.
                                                              -
   In Professor Martin’s process only 100 grains of nitrate of
silver are required. The formula is to dissolve the nitrate in
water, add ammonia till the brown oxide redissolves completely,
then pour in slowly 80 grains of caustic soda in solution.          If
this produces a precipitate, the quantity of ammonia must be
increased. The reducing agent is procured by boiling 124 parts
of white sugar in 100 parts of water with 1 part of nitric acid,
and adding water to make 500 parts with 50 parts of alcohol.
Two ounces and a half of this liquid are to be mixed with the
previous solution just before the glass is immersed.      The draw
back to this process, as compared with Cimeg's, is that there are
often many minute holes in the silver, particularly if the solu
tions have been freshly prepared.      They cannot be avoided by
previous filtration.
   The durability of silver films under favourable circumstances
is quite surprising. When not exposed to sulphuretted hydrogen,
they do not show any disposition to tarnish, and,       all
                                                         things con
sidered, are more lasting than the polished specula that are       in
the observatory.     These latter are apt   toaccumulate      yellow

film, which interferes  asseriously with their photographic power
as  does the reddish colour    so strongly seen  in Gregorians and
Newtonians when the      copper   and tin are   incorrectly  propor
tioned. The silvered surfaces however, are,      occasionally  liable
to  an accident which does not affect the others.         A series of

254    Photographic Use of a Silvered-Glass Reflecting Telescope,
being developed with sulphate of iron, is brought out with pyro
 gallic acid, it assumes a much more brilliant aspect, the contrast
 of light and dark parts is greater, and the picture more lively.
 In enlarging such a photograph, by treating the reverse or posi
 tive made from the original negative with iodide of mercury
 dissolved in iodide of potassium, the contrast can be increased
 at pleasure, the dark parts of the collodion film gaining more
 than their due proportion of strength. The eventual paper proof,
 instead of being flat, is whiter in the high lights and darker in
 the deep shades than it should be. Such a result shows the
 uncertainty of any method of comparing the actinic force of
 various parts of the moon together, and attempting to deduce
 therefrom arguments as to their composition. The nature of
 the collodion and sensitizing compounds used makes also a ma
 terial difference.    I have found that, as a rule, it is better to use
 sulphate of iron alone in those phases where the moon is about
 one-half illuminated, and graduate the strength of the solution
 so as to gain the most desirable result.         The parts of the surface
on which the      sunlight  is falling nearly   perpendicularly,  are only
too   prone  to become overdark as       compared    with those on which
the light strikes obliquely.          The contrast requires restraint
rather than encouragement.           The negatives should present the
appearance of overdone positives to enlarge well.               Even with
the best system of development, it is impossible to secure a good
picture of the entire portion of the moon visible in the first and
third quarters; for either the larger portion must be overdeve
loped and overexposed to secure the extreme edge, or else the
most obliquely illuminated part must be left undeveloped.                It
may be      possible  to overcome this      difficulty  in the  future, by
diaphragms so adjusted as to cut off the brighter light while the
fainter parts continue to act.
    In any operation of forcing or intensifying, it is necessary to
bear in mind that the deposit constituting the image is not a con
tinuous film, but is more or less granular. Most of the processes
of redeveloping tend to increase the size of the silver grains,
and, if practised injudiciously upon photographs that have sub
sequently to be magnified, may impair them seriously. Sulphate
of iron employed alone for educing a picture seems to give the
finest granulations, particularly if the sensitive plate, previous to
exposure to light, has been washed in water so as to remove
          in its
most of        free nitrate of   silver.    It requires, however,   to  be
redipped         the nitrate-of-silver bath before being treated with
the sulphate. The free nitrate         of silver necessary to  the reduc
tion cannot        be
                   advantageously    supplied  otherwise;   and the sensi
tiveness would be decreased.
    No photograph that has       to    magnified should
                                      be                   be  varnished.

Apart from the fact that it is entirely unnecessary, it is sure to
produce some markings or imperfections. Dust and little hairs
adhere to the film while sticky, and when dry it is certain to be
either finely corrugated, or else dotted with little transparent
elevations, which act like lenses toward the bright beam of light
subsequently used.       In order to be secure against accidents,                                I
always keep two or three reverses of the finest negatives.   These,
being copied by contact in rays diverging from a point, are just
as valuable as the original.
   With regard to the means used for enlarging, they were at
first single and compound achromatic combinations.        But these
present two defects.      The visual and actinic foci are made to
coincide, even approximately, with difficulty; and when in addi
tion a flat field, sometimes 5 feet in diameter, is required, such
lenses as could be obtained failed entirely.    It then occurred to
me to   supply   their place by a concave mirror of suitable figure,
and both difficulties have in consequence been surmounted.
The field is flat, as is shown by examination on ground glass,
and in the produced photograph.        As for the sharpness,  have                    I
made a  picture   of a scale of  Lepisma saccharina under a  power
of 289, by taking a photograph magnified seventeen times, and
then magnifying that.        It shows the characteristic markings
almost as well as a      microscope.   With this contrivance, the
whole interior of the observatory, 27 feet long, can be used as a
camera obscura.

To       the physical geologist the conformation
         of
                                                      the Alps, and
            mountain-regions generally, constitutes one    the most
                                                                      of

interesting problems           of
                           the present day. To account for this
conformation, two hypotheses have been advanced, which may                                      be
respectively named the hypothesis       fracture and the hypothesis
                                                  of
of  erosion.    Those who adopt the former maintain that the
forces   by which the Alps were elevated produced fissures      the                       in
earth’s   crust, and that the valleys    the Alps are the tracks
                                                  of                                            of
of these fissures.   Those who hold the latter hypothesis maintain
                                                                            of ice

     I  had heard it stated that the Via Mala was a striking illus
 tration of the fissure theory—that the profound chasm thus
 named, and through which the Hinter-Rhein now flows,
                                                                             could
 be nothing else than a crack in the earth’s crust. To the Via
 Mala this year             I
                          therefore went, to instruct myself by actual
 observation upon the point in question. The gorge commences
 about a quarter of an hour above the town of Tusis; and, on
 entering      it,the conclusion which first gains credence                 that     is            it
          be
 must     a    fissure. This conclusion               my case was modified

purely mechanical; they are cut away, sometimes in sensible

of broad valleys. Such a fissure might enter into the list of acci
dents which gave direction to the real erosive agents which scooped
 the valley out; but the formation of the valley, as it now exists,
 could no more be ascribed to it than the motion of a railway train
 could be ascribed to the finger of the engineer which turns on
 the steam.
    These deep gorges occur,               I
                                    believe, for the most part in lime
 stone strata; and the effects which the merest driblet of water
 can produce on such rocks are quite astonishing.              It is not un
common to meet chasms of considerable depth produced by small
streams the beds of which are dry for a large portion of the year.
 Right and left of the larger gorges such secondary chasms are
usually to be found. The idea of time must, think, be more               I
and more included in our reasonings on these phenomena. Hap
pily the marks which the rivers have, in most cases, left behind
them, and which refer, geologically considered, to actions of
yesterday, give us ground and courage to conceive what may be
effected in geologic periods. Thus the modern portion of the Via
Mala throws light upon the whole.            Near Bergün in the Valley
of the Albula there is also a little Via Mala which is not less
significant than the great one. The river flows here through a
profound limestone gorge; but to the very edges of the gorge we
have the evidences of erosion.       The most striking illustration of
water-action upon limestone rock which                        I

are compelled to resort to local disturbances, the manipulation
of the earth’s crust which will be necessary to obtain the valleys
and the mountains will, I imagine, bring the difficulties of the
theory into very strong relief. Indeed an examination of the
region from many of the more accessible eminences—from
the Galenstock, the Grauhaupt, the Pitz Languard, the Monte
Confinale—or, better still, from Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa,
the Jungfrau, the Finsteraarhorn, the Weisshorn, or the Mat
terhorn, where local peculiarities are toned down, and the ope
rations of the powers which really made this region what it is
are alone brought into prominence, must,           I   imagine, convince
every physically minded man of the inability of any fracture
theory to account for the present conformation of the Alps.              A
correct model of the mountains, with an unexaggerated vertical
scale, produces the same effect upon the mind as the prospect
from one of the highest peaks. We are apt to be influenced
by local phenomena which, though insignificant in view of the
general question of Alpine conformation, are, with reference to
our customary standards, vast and impressive.             In a true model
those local peculiarities disappear; for on the scale of a model they
are too small to be visible; while the essential facts and forms
are presented to the undistracted attention.
    A minute analysis of the phenomena strengthens the conviction
which the general aspect of the Alps fixes in the mind.                 We
find, for example, numerous valleys which the most ardent plu
 tonist would not think of ascribing to any other agency than
 erosion.     That such is their genesis and history is as certain as
that erosion produced the Chines in the Isle of Wight. From
 these indubitable cases of erosion—commencing, if necessary,
 with the small ravines which run down the flanks of the ridges,
 with their little working navigators at their bottoms—we can
 proceed, by almost insensible gradations, to the largest valleys
 of the Alps; and it would perplex the plutonist to            fixupon the
 point at   which,    inhis opinion, fracture begins    to   play    mate
                                                                     a
 rial  part.  In    ascending    one of   the larger  valleys, we enter        it
 where
       it
       is       wide and where the eminences are gentle              on
                                                                     either
 side.    The flanking mountains become higher and more abrupt
 as  we ascend, and        length we reach
                           at                a  place where the depth          of
 the   valleyis   a  maximum.      Continuing     our walk upwards we
 find ourselves flanked         by
                               gentler slopes, and finally emerge from
 the valley and reach the summit       of   an open col,or   depression        in
 the chain  of   mountains. This     is    the common character           of
                                                                        the
 large valleys.      Crossing the col,    we  descend along the opposite
 slope of   the chain, and through the same series     of   appearances        in
 the reverse order.        Ifthe  valleys   on both sides of  the col were
 produced    by  fissures, what prevents the fissure from prolonging

itself across the colº The case here cited is representative; and
I am not acquainted with a single instance in the Alps where the
chain has been cracked in the manner indicated. The cols are
simply depressions; and in the case of many of them the unfis
sured rock can be traced from side to side.
    The typical instance just sketched follows as a natural conse
quence from the theory of erosion.      Before either ice or water
can exert great power as an erosive agent, it must collect in suf
ficient mass.    On the higher slopes and plateaus—in the region
of cols—the     power  is not fully developed; but lower down
tributaries unite, erosion is carried on with increased vigour,
and the excavation gradually reaches a maximum. Lower still
the elevations diminish and the slopes become more gentle; the
cutting-power gradually relaxes, until finally the eroding agent
quits the mountains altogether, and the grand effects which it
produced in the earlier portions of                      its
                                        course entirely disappear.

the velocity diminishes as we descend the glacier. In 100 hours
the maximum motion of the three lines respectively is as follows:—

  This deportment explains an appearance which must strike
every observer who looks upon this glacier from the Pitz Lan
guard, or from the new Bermina Road. A medial moraine runs
along the glacier, commencing as a narrow streak high up; but
towards the end the moraine extends in width, and finally
quite covers the terminal portion of the glacier. The cause of
this is revealed by the foregoing measurements, which prove that
a stone on the moraine where it is crossed by the line A, ap
proaches a second stone on the moraine where it is crossed by
the line C with a velocity of 26 inches in 100 hours. The
moraine is in a state of longitudinal compression. Its materials
are more and more crowded together, and must consequently
move laterally and render the moraine at the terminal portion
of the glacier wider than above.
   The motion of the Morteratsch glacier, then, diminishes as we
descend.   The maximum motion of the third line is 30 inches
in 100 hours, or 7 inches a day—a very slow motion; and had
we run our lines nearer to the end of the glacier, the motion
would have been slower still. At the end itself it is nearly
insensible. Now        I
                   submit that this is not the place to seek for
the scooping power of a glacier. The opinion appears to be pre
valent that it is the snout of a glacier that must act the part
of ploughshare; and it is certainly an erroneous opinion. The
scooping power will exert itself most where the weight, and con
sequently, other things being equal, the motion is greatest.        A
glacier's snout often rests upon matter which has been scooped
from the glacier's bed higher up. I therefore do not think that
the inspection of what the end of a glacier does or does not
accomplish can decide this question.                              -
    The snout of a glacier is potent to remove anything against
which it can fairly abut; and this power, notwithstanding the
slowness of the motion, manifests itself at the end of the Mor
teratsch glacier.    A hillock, bearing pine trees, was in front of
the  glacier when Mr. Hirst and myself inspected       end; and this
                                                               its
hillock is  being bodily removed           by
                                      the thrust          of
                                                    the ice. Several
of  the trees are overturned; and          few years,
                                            in   a        the glacier

continues    its reputed   advance,  the mound - will   certainly     be
ploughed away.

   This is an extremely slowly moving glacier; the maximum
here found hardly amounts to 7 inches a day. Crevasses pre
vented me from continuing the line quite across the glacier.
   To return to the question of Alpine conformation,--it stands,
I  think, thus:—We have, in the first place, great valleys,
such as those of the Rhine and the Rhone, to which we might
conveniently give the name of valleys of the 1st order. The
mountains which flank these main valleys are also cut by lateral
valleys which run into the main one, and which may be called
valleys of the 2nd order.       When these latter are examined,
smaller valleys are found running into them, which may be called
valleys of the 3rd order. Smaller ravines and depressions, again,
join the latter, which may be called valleys of the 4th order, and
so on until we reach streaks and cuttings so minute as not to
merit the name of valleys at all. At the bottom of every valley
we have a stream, diminishing in magnitude as the order of the
valley ascends, carving eternally at the earth and carrying                 its
materials   to lower levels.   We find moreover that the larger
valleys have been filled for untold ages      glaciers  byenormousof
dimensions, and that these glaciers were always moving, grinding
down and tearing away the rocks over which they past.          We
have, moreover,      on
                      the  plains which extend      the feet at the    of
mountains, and       enormous quantities, the very matter derived
                    in
from the sculpture       of
                        the mountains themselves.     The plains            of
Italy and Switzerland are cumbered   the débris    by

ones.      In the vast quantities of moraine-matter which cum
  ber   many  of the valleys we have also suggestions as to the
  magnitude of the erosion which has taken place.          This moraine
  matter, moreover, is only in part derived from the falling of
 rocks from the eminences upon the glacier; it is also in great part
  derived from the grinding and the ploughing-out of the glacier
  itself. This accounts for the magnitude of many of these ancient
 moraines, which date from a period when almost                 the moun                       all
 tains were covered with                          ice
                              and snow, and when consequently the
 quantity         of
               moraine-matter derived from the naked crests cannot
 have been considerable.     The erosion theory ascribes the forma

standard to which the liquid and solid thermometers were com
pared, but also with respect to the chemical hypothesis of equi
valent combining-volumes of gases.
   The laws of the expansion of the gases by equal increments,
proposed by Gay-Lussac, and of uniform expansion, proposed by
Dalton, give results which differ very little between the points of
the freezing and boiling of water, but they diverge greatly at
higher temperatures.    Dalton's law, expressed in the formula
V=Wo.    e”, where W is the volume of a gas at tº above the
zero-point of the thermometric scale, and Wo the volume at the
zero of the scale, had a greater primá facie claim to be considered
a physical law than that of Gay-Lussac, of which the formula is
W=Wo(1+ atº), because, the expansion for one degree in the

   A cules in a state of equilibrium under the action of the forces
proper to the particles, or of these in connexion with extraneous
forces taking effect upon the particles.     The interstices between
the molecules we conceive to be pervaded by both the electric
and the universal aether, having probably different densities in
different substances.    The state of equilibrium in which each
particle of the mass subsists, implies that the effective forces
acting upon       from opposite sides, are equal and directly op

which the laws of effective molecular action, as shown by the
proper curve, depend.
   Contemplating from our present point of view the varying
mechanical states and conditions which the same substance may
assume under different circumstances, we are led to recognize, as
an essential physical feature, upon which such changes either
wholly or partially depend, the fact that the mechanical condi
tion of the individual molecules is not fixed and unchangeable,
but liable to material variations. We perceive their atmo
spheres expanding under the influence of heat, and contracting
from the effect of external pressure, and that certain phenomena
and permanent changes of property result from these atmospheric
changes      (e.   g.

    The views which have now been presented enable us to form
a definite conception of the probable arrangement of the mole
cules of a liquid.         If the state of equilibrium be such as we have
represented, we must conclude that a perfectly symmetrical ar
rangement of particles, similar to that which subsists in crystals,
prevails throughout the whole mass.
    We conceive the fundamental distinction between a solid and
a  liquid,   from the mechanical point of view, to be that the exter
nal impulses which fall upon the molecule of a solid, are propa
gated, either wholly or chiefly, in their original line of direction;
while those which fall upon the molecule of a liquid are radiated

 of the particles at the different orders of distance come succes
 sively into action, being less intercepted by intervening particles.
 At the same time, the individual molecular atmospheres expand,
 or recede from their central atoms, under the action of the heat
 pulses that penetrate to these atoms; and so the energy of the
 attractive force of each of these molecules declines.     The sur
  face particles will thus continue to recede at the same time that
 they are restrained by the attractions of those below them.
 This effect will extend from the surface downward; and as a
 final result, a certain number of layers are brought into the

pended in this manner, a portion of them pass into the mole
cular atmospheres and elevate the temperature of the liquid. If
the pressure upon the free surface of the liquid exceeds the
pressure of the atmosphere, the molecular atmospheres are more
compressed,     the value of         m becomes     greater, and the    ratio;
diminishes in consequence; from this cause the limit                of the re
cess of the particles (Od, fig. 1) diminishes, and the maximum
repulsion dn increases (see Table I.). The resulting vapour has,
therefore, at the same time a higher tension and a greater
density.
     ºrding to the           theoretical views now advanced, the      “inte
rior work” which Tyndall maintains is expended in the act of
liquefaction, and also in that of vaporization, in “moving the
atoms into new positions,” or in conferring “potential energy’
upon them, is consumed in each instance in pressing up the
electric atmospheres that surround the atoms of the substance;
and heat disappears in the process in proportion to the effect
thus produced.

 XXXIII.       Summary of the Properties of certain Stream-Lines.
By W.    J.   MAcquoRN RANKINE, C.E., LL.D., F.R.S.S.L. & E.”
1.           investigation, of which the present paper is a sum
     THEmary, consists      of three parts.   It is a sequel to one of
which an abstract was read at the     Meeting    of the British Asso
ciation in 1863, and which has since been printed in full in the
Philosophical Transactions f. It relates to the paths in which
the particles of a liquid move past a solid body. In the previous
paper (which was confined to motion in two dimensions) those
paths were called “Water-Lines,” and were treated of with a view
mainly to their use as figures for the horizontal or nearly hori
zontal water-lines of ships. In the present paper they are called
“Stream-Lines,” as being a more general term, and one less liable
to be misunderstood when motion in three dimensions is con
sidered.
   The term “Neoid” (vnoeu8)s, ship-like) proposed in the pre
vious paper as a general name for water-line curves in two               di
                                         all all

                                      the stream-lines discussed
the  present paper;   for they  are    applicable        to

                             1863.

        PART        I.—On       some    Eaponential Stream-Lines in two
                                        Dimensions.
  2. It is well known that amongst the functions which satisfy
the conditions of liquid motion in two dimensions, are compre
hended all those of the form
                                    y+X. e” cos aw.
 Such functions as the above obviously represent curves consist
 ing of an endless series of repetitions of the same figure; and
 many of those curves resemble the profiles of waves.
    3. The first part of the investigation consists of a discussion
 of the properties of the curves represented by the simplest of
 those exponential            stream-line functions, viz.
                                    b=y—e"        cosa. .   .     .    .    .     .    (I.)
 By giving to b a set of values in arithmetical progression, this
 function is made to represent a set of stream-lines, dividing an
 indefinitely extended plane layer of liquid into a series of curved
 streams of equal flow.     Each of those stream-lines consists of an
"endless series of repetitions of the same figure, the length parallel
 to a of each repetition being 27; and each repetition
                                                 -
                                                           consists of
 a pair of symmetrical halves.
    4. The graphic construction of those stream-lines is very
 easy, by the aid of a general method of constructing curves first
 used by Professor Clerk Maxwell, and applied by the present
  author to stream-lines in the previous investigation already
 referred to.
    Draw a series of straight lines parallel to a, and having for
 their equation

 —the values of    being in arithmetical progression, positive and
                          m
 negative, with a fraction for their common difference, which
 should be the smaller the more accurate the drawing is to be.
 Then draw a series of curves of hyperbolic-logarithmic cosines,
 having for their equation
                                         e" cosa-m',
 —the values of ml, positive and negative, forming an arithmetical
 progression, and having the same common difference with those
 of m. The curves with positive values of m'     between wa0     lie

 method is founded on the supposition that diminution of the
 volume of a body implies an evolution or generation of heat;
 and it involves essentially a false analogy between the natural
 fall of a body to the earth, and the condensation produced in an
 elastic fluid by the application of external force. The hypothesis
 on which he thus grounds a definite numerical estimate of the
 relation between the agencies here involved, is that the heat
 evolved when an elastic fluid is compressed and kept cool, is
 simply the dynamical equivalent of the work employed in com
 pressing        The experimental investigations
                   it.                                       subsequent                    of

l'intermédiaire de la vapeur ou de tout autre agent que l’on pour
rait y substituer.”
     Compare this with Dr. Tyndall’s quotation (Phil. Mag. Sept.
 1862).      “The law,” says Mayer, “‘Heat = Mechanical Effect”
is  independent     of the nature of an elastic fluid, which only serves
 as the   apparatus,   by means of which the one force is converted
 into the other.”                                     -
    Again, Séguin says, “La force mécanique qui apparait pendant
 l'abaissement de température d'un gaz comme de tout autre corps
 qui se dilate, est la mesure et la représentation de cette diminu
 tion de chaleur;” and further, in speaking of steam escaping
 into the air, “L’effort qu’elle exerce en recul contre les appareils
 quila laissent échapper, ou la vitesse qu’elle communique à l’air
 ambiant, forme un équivalent de la perte de chaleur qu’elle
 éprouve.” Yet, according to Dr. Tyndall, it was Mayer “who
 first used the term ‘equivalent” in the precise sense in which
 you” (Joule, to whom the letter is addressed) “have ap
 plied it.”
     But there is more than this in Séguin’s very able work. He
 points out distinctly that steam which has done work in an
 engine ought not to heat the water in the condenser so much as
 if it had been led directly into             He had made,
                                                   it.               says, nu      he
 merous      experiments       testtothis,   without however        obtaining
 sufficiently decisive results.       Again,        points out how very

in   doing work.      He  says  that the work obtained from             steam           a

holtz’s    “Erhaltung” is an identical word, and was employed
before Rankine wrote on the subject.    But the term Energy (as
Dr. Tyndall surely is aware) is due to Young, who introduced it
as a convenient English term synonymous with vis viva. Its exten
sion to the two forms “static” and “dynamic" was made by
Thomson. Rankine improved these to “potential” and “actual;”
                                                      I

as less ambiguous and more suggestive than “actual.”
   As to the discovery of the Conservation of Energy,             hold that     I
to lay down, without experimental bases, such a maxim as “causa
aquat effectum ” is entirely subversive of common sense and logic
in an experimental science such as natural philosophy. The esta
blishment of the Conservation of Energy was utterly out of the
sphere of the “Thinker;” and it would be absurd to give him
more credit than is due to the promulgator of a clever specula
tion.    Thousands of equally clever, but less lucky, though not
more    baseless,  speculations are every day mercilessly extermi
nated   by  experiment.             -
   Celestial Dynamics forms no part of the Thermo-dynamic
theory, though it affords exceedingly beautiful applications of                           it.

XXXV.     On the Erosion of Valleys and Lakes; a Reply to Sir
   RoDERICK MURCHIsoN’s Anniversary Address to the Geogra

A".        the publication of my memoir “On the Glacial
      Origin of certain Lakes in the Ice-worn regions of Europe
and North America,” several eminent British and Continental
geologists, and some other persons who have only a general
literary acquaintance with physical geology, did me the honour,
in special memoirs, or in letters in newspapers, to express opi
nions that my views were deserving of the strongest opposition..
To none of these opponents have heretofore made any reply,   I
and some of them, I found, were dealt with by men who met
their arguments more ably perhaps than                    could have done       I
myself. Besides, I considered that if my theory, as believe,                                    I
be true, it would be sure in the long run to make                   way just                  its

any man of weight and knowledge could be found to follow me
at all.         I
           may therefore be pardoned if in this instance    depart                                          I
from the course of leaving the value of my theory to be worked
out solely by time.
   I have said that Sir Roderick has entered an authoritative
protest, because, as several persons have remarked to me, so much
stress has been laid on the argumentum ad hominem, liberally as
regards Continental geologists, and more sparingly with Ame
rican and English names.        Indeed, in reading the Address,                                                           I
was more than once reminded of the observation of one of my
•opponents,    who in the ‘Reader’ observed to this effect, “that
Professor Desor entirely disagrees with Professor Ramsay—how
can he do otherwise? for Desor has lived among glaciers                      his                                  all

numerous appeals           nature,” Gastaldi, De Mortillet, and many

“ruptures” are only manifest to those who accept such hypotheses
“without inquiring into what has been the former state of things,
or what will be the future”*.    To this day there is no error so
common, even among geologists, as that which vaguely attri
butes the form and nature of the present surface-outlines of the
earth chiefly to the operation of violent disturbance in recent
geological times, not clearly perceiving that the great and small
outlines of mountain-chains, of valleys, of river-gorges and of
plains are the combined results of an immense number of opera
tions, many of these going back to exceedingly remote periods of
geological antiquity, and a great proportion of their details being
lost even to probable conjecture.
   These operations, however, in the production of scenery mainly
resolve themselves into the following series, the parts of which,
ever since land and water first existed, may be arranged in any
possible combination.
   a. Oscillation with respect to the sea-level of rocks that have or
 have not been contorted and metamorphosed, accompanied by pauses
 in oscillation of greater or less duration.
    b. Great plains of marine denudation.
    c. Subaérial denudations of                 all
                                        kinds; wearing away        sea                    of

Roderick's opinion seems to have been formed a long time ago;

he draws an enormous glacier, which issuing from the broad flat
valley of the Rhine, tranquilly overspread the country on           sides                                     all
of the  lake, and without the   necessity  for any  plunge,  could only

 peaks are tipped with perpetual snow. The Rhone glacier had
 therefore no lack of tributaries to maintain its mass over all the
 area of the Lake of Geneva, though towards the west, where the
 glacier thinned away, that mass would be less than over the
 eastern half of the lake, where weight and grinding-power must,
I  believe, on that account have necessarily been greater.             But
 the main flow of the ice, after escaping from the Rhone valley,
 was necessarily of a mixed nature, partly to the N.W., and also
 to a great extent to the N.E. and S.W., simply because the N.W.
 face of the glacier abutted on the Jura.          For it requires no pro
 found   knowledge    of physics   to  perceive  that any body, whether
 actually plastic like pitch, or of a modified plasticity that may be
fractured and reunite like jelly”, or that by “fracture and regela
 tion” behaves like a plastic body, I say it requires no profound
 knowledge of physics to understand that such a body, constantly
 renewed and pressed on from behind, when opposed by a high
 impassable barrier (like the Jura), will spread itself out in the
direction of least resistance, that direction in the case of the
 Rhone glacier having been at right angles to the general pres
sure, or N.E. and S.W., whence                          I
                                           believe the general form and
trend of the Lake of Neuchatel.
    But, in the second place, is there indeed no proof that ice
 “neither has nor has had any excavating power,” whether in val

I have       of the confluence of immense glaciers like those that
           said
once united in the valley of the Lago Maggiore at what are now
the Borromean Isles.       But it seems to me that to any one who
allows  any  excavating   power  to a glacier, it will be evident that
when the   general  inclination of a valley was comparatively steep,
a glacier could have had no opportunity of cutting for itself any
special basin-shaped hollows.       Its course, with a difference, is
like that of a torrent. But in a flat-bottomed part of a valley,
or in a comparative plain that lies at the base of a mountain
range, the case is not the same.        For instance, to take an ex
treme  case, if a glacier tumble over a slope of 45°, no one would
dream of the ice-flow producing any special effect, except that
in the long run, the upper edge of the rock that forms the cata
ract being worn away,                  its
                             average angle would        lowered.  And         be
so   of minor slopes;      the ice flowing fast (for glacier) rendered
                                 if                                      a
the rocky surface underneath unequal, such inequalities could not
become great and permanent; for the rapidly flowing ice would
attack the projecting parts with greater power and effect than the
minor hollows, and               so
                           preserve       approximate uniformity,
                                                   an                                                or    an
average angle          of
                     moderate inclination.       But when monstrous                     a
glacier descended into          comparative plain,
                                       a                  into     low, flat

how awfully high and rugged they are; can any amount of time,
aided by weather, torrents, rivers, and glaciers produce such
effects?   Old writers, like Hutton and Playfair, and a few
modern observers (some of whom, both in America and Europe,
have great familiarity with rocks), say they can; but we know that
rending and fracture is the chief agent, and denudation is in com
parison quite a trifling affair. Look, again, at the hollows of the
lakes, how awfully deep they are      How is it possible for a glacier
ever to have slid  up  a hill from a depth so profound?”            In
treating the slopes as great, consists the viciousness of this sup
posed argument. Unconsciously, some of the arguers are draw
ing exaggerated diagrams in their minds. They foreshorten the
slope, increase in their mind's eye          steepness, and forget
                                                                             let its

those who    still believe it refer for proof to the contrary to Mr.
 Geikie's admirable work “On the Phenomena of the Glacial Drift
of Scotland.’                  I
                  know enough of the superficial strata in North
America to foresee that the erratic deposits there will some day
also be divided into terrestrial and marine series, and I am
pretty sure that Sir William Logan will not deny the proba
bility.  For the vast size of the ancient glaciers of that con
tinent,        I
          would refer to Professor Dana’s admirable Manual of
American Geology. It is a mistake to suppose that the stria
tions there merely run from north to south, for Sir William
Logan, who has mapped them, proves that they often conform
to the bends of the valleys.
   As regards the great lakes of that continent, so far from being
“cavities originally due to a combination of ruptures and denu

a  word which     subsequently    had,  for     long   period, a divers and
consequently vague meanings.                        *
     In Descartes's Principia Philosophiae (Pars II.,             xxxvi.) we            §

The gelatine, when dried in the manner described upon plates of calc
spar and mica, did not adhere to the crystalline surface, but detached
itself on drying.  Polished plates of glass must not be left in con
tact, as is well known, owing to the risk of permanent adhesion
between their surfaces.  The adhesion of broken masses of glacial
phosphoric acid to each other is an old illustration of colloidal
synaeresis.
   Bearing in mind that the colloidal phasis of matter is the result
of a peculiar attraction and aggregation of molecules, properties
never entirely absent from matter but greatly more developed in
some substances than in others, it is not surprising that colloidal
characters spread on both sides into the liquid and solid condi
tions.    These characters appear in the viscidity of liquids, and
in the softness and adhesiveness of certain crystalline substances.

 otherwise it may gelatinize during the experiment.                 may be                         If I
 allowed to distinguish the liquid and gelatinous hydrates of silicic
 acid by theirregularly formed terms of hydrosol and hydrogel of silicic
 acid, the two corresponding alcoholic bodies now introduced may be
 named the alcosol and alcogel of silicic acid.
    The alcosol of silicic acid, containing 1 per cent. of the latter, is a
 colourless liquid, not precipitated by water or salts, nor by contact
with insoluble powders, probably from the small proportion of silicic
acid present in solution.      It may be boiled and evaporated without
 change, but is gelatinized by a slight concentration.       The alcohol is
retained less strongly in the alcosol of silicic acid than water is in the
hydrosol, but with the same varying force, a small portion of the
alcohol being held so strongly as to char when the resulting jelly is
rapidly distilled at a high temperature. Not a trace of silicic ether
is found in any compound of this class.         The jelly burns readily in
 the air, leaving the whole silicic acid in the form of a white ash.
    The alcogel, or solid compound, is readily prepared by placing
masses of gelatinous silicic acid, containing 8 or 10 per cent. of the
dry acid, in absolute alcohol, and changing the latter repeatedly till
the water of the hydrogel is fully replaced by alcohol.         The alcogel
is generally slightly opalescent, and is similar in aspect to the hydrogel,
preserving very nearly            its
                             original bulk. The following         the com                          is

The glycerogel has somewhat less bulk than the original hydrogel.
When a glycerine jelly is distilled by heat, it does not fuse, but the
whole of the glycerine comes over, with a slight amount of decom
position towards the end of the process.

silicic acid, the combined water (a crystalloid) leaves the acid (a col
loid) to diffuse into alcohol; and if the alcohol be repeatedly
changed, the entire water is thus removed, alcohol (another crystal
loid) at the same time taking the place of water in combination with
the silicic acid. The liquid in excess (here the alcohol) gains entire
possession of the silicic acid.  The process is reversed if an alcogel
be placed in a considerable volume of water. Then alcohol separates
from combination, in consequence of the opportunity it possesses to
diffuse into water; and water, which is now the liquid present in
excess, recovers possession of the silicic acid.    Such changes illus
trate the predominating influence of mass.
   Even the compounds of silicic acid with alkalies yield to the decom
posing force of diffusion.    The compound of silicic acid with 1 or 2
per cent. of soda is a colloidal solution, and, when placed in a dialyzer
over water in vacuo to exclude carbonic acid, suffers gradual decom
position.  The soda diffuses off slowly in the caustic state, and gives
the usual brown oxide of silver when tested with the nitrate of that
base.
   The pectization of liquid silicic acid and many other liquid col
loids is effected by contact with minute quantities of salts in a way
which is not understood. On the other hand, the gelatinous acid
may again be liquefied and have           energy restored   its

the liquid upon a dialyzer for            several days.      The liquid must not
contain more than 1         per   cent. of titanic     acid,  otherwise it sponta
neously gelatinizes, but it appears more stable when dilute.                     Both
titanic and the two stannic acids afford the same classes of com
pounds with alcohol &c. as are obtained with silicic acid.
    Liquid Tungstic Acid.—The obscurity which has so long hung
over tungstic acid is removed by a dialytic examination.                      It is in
fact a remarkable colloid, of which the pectous form alone has
hitherto been known.           Liquid tungstic acid is prepared by adding
 dilute hydrochloric acidcarefully to a 5 per cent. solution of tung
state of soda, in sufficient proportion to meutralize the alkali, and then
placing the resulting liquid on a dialyser.              In about three days the
 acid is found pure, with the loss of about 20 per cent., the salts
having diffused entirely away.             It is remarkable that the purified
acid is not     pectized   by  acids or salts even at the boiling tempe
rature.     Evaporated      to dryness, it forms vitreous scales, like gum
or   gelatine,  which sometimes adhere so strongly to the surface of
 the  evaporating    dish as to detach portions of                    may        it.

  1.   “On    the Fossiliferous Rocks of Forfarshire and their contents.”
By James Powrie, Esq., F.G.S.
   Referring to his former paper for a detailed description of the
lower members of the Forfarshire Old Red Sandstone, the author
now gave a general sketch of the relations of the several beds,
and then descriptions of the species of Crustacea and Fish oc
curring in them. The latter belong to five genera, two of which
(Ischnacanthus and Euthacanthus) are new.       After discussing the
nature of Parka decipiens, and shortly noticing the genera of Crus
tacea that occur in the same rocks, Mr. Powrie concluded his paper
with a short synopsis of the distribution of the members of the Old
Red Sandstone in Forfarshire, and a discussion respecting the sub
division of that formation, in which he stated that Pterygotus, Parka
decipiens, and Cephalaspis are always associated in the same beds,
and extend through all the fossiliferous rocks of Forfarshire, instead
of the latter characterizing a higher horizon than the others.
  2.   “On    the Reptiliferous  Rocks and Foot-print Strata of the
North-east of Scotland.”       By Prof. R. Harkness, F.R.S.S. L. & E.,
F.G.S.
   The author showed that the foot-print sandstones of Ross-shire
constitute the upper portion of the Old Red Sandstone formation,
and that the strata embraced in a line of section from the Nigg to
Cambus Shandwick, from above the Gneiss to the foot-print sand
stones of Tarbet Ness inclusive, are conformable throughout, and
are referable to each of the three divisions of the Old Red Sand
stone,—namely, the conglomerates and yellow sandstones (of a thick
ness of 1500 feet) belonging to the Iower Old Red Sandstone; the
grey flaggy sandstones and shales of Geanies—the      equivalent of
the Caithness      flags—containing             Osteolepis,     Coccosteus,   and   Acan
thodes, and thus referable to the              Middle Old Red; thirdly, conform
able strata, consisting of conglomerates and foot-bearing and other
sandstones appertaining to the higher members of the system.
The foot-bearing sandstones have a thickness of 400 feet, and re
present the reptiliferous sandstones of the Elgin area, though   -    not
overlain by Cornstones as in that district.
   The author, in conclusion, remarked that though Stagonolepis is
                              in of its
decidedly. Teleosaurian in        affinities,      does not consequently
                                                       it
mark   a  Mesozoic   group       rocks;     for  Mastodontosauria, which
abound   inthe Trias, occur     the Coal-measures; and stratigraphical
evidence shows      usthat Teleosaurian crocodiles have        wider geo  a
logical range, since they are met with          the Old Red Sandstone.

this paper are those which have been, and are still being explored
under the direction of MM. Lartet and Christy, and which were
visited by him under the guidance of the latter gentleman and ac
companied by Mr. Hamilton, Prof. Rupert Jones, Capt. Galton,
Mr. Lubbock, and Mr. Franks.
   Mr. Evans first gave a detailed description of the physical features
of the valley of the Vézère, and of the contents of the caverns of
Badegoule, Le Moustier, La Madelaine, Laugerie-Haute, Laugerie
Basse, the Gorge d'Enfer, and Les Eyzies, giving a list of the
animal-remains discovered, which are for the most part of the same
species from              all
                 the caverns.

the South of Scotland.”     By      J.
                                   Young, M.D., F.R.S.E.
   The  heights  bordering the counties of Peebles and Dumfries are
stated by the author to contain well-preserved remains of a group of
Glaciers belonging to a later period than the Boulder-clay, and
some of which have been already alluded to by Mr. Geikie and Mr.
Chambers.     Dr. Young then describes the physical geography of
the region, grouping the several hills into three ranges—the Broad
Law Range, the White Coomb Range, and Hartfell—from which
certain glaciers formerly descended into the valleys; and he further
divides the glaciers into two classes, which he terms respectively
the “Social” and the “Solitary.” The author then describes the
form and extension of the masses of detritus which he considers to
be glacial débris, contrasting their characters with those of the
patches of Boulder-clay occurring in the neighbourhood.
   Many indications of glaciers are shown to be much obscured by
the prevalence of peat in the district; but, in addition to the mo
raine matter, smoothed surfaces and roches moutonnées are occa
sionally   seen.
   7. “On the Formation and Preservation of Lakes by Ice-action.”
By Thomas Belt, Esq.
   During a residence of two years in the province of Nova Scotia,
the author observed the remarkable number of lakes, great and
small, occurring there, sometimes in connected chains and some
times on the sides and tops of hills.   The lake-basins are stated to
be chiefly in extremely hard quartzites and metamorphosed schists,
irregularly studded with masses of Boulder-clay, beneath which are
seen scratches, grooves, &c., that have been produced by ice-action.
The author then describes all the phenomena in detail, and gives a
résumé of the theory of their glacial origin, as propounded by Pro
fessor Ramsay, coming to the conclusion that in this way only can
the facts be consistently explained.
  8.   “A          of the Principal Geological Features of Hobart,
                Sketch
Tasmania.”     By S. H. Wintle, Esq.
   The hills  upon which Hobart is built, as well as those in the
vicinity, are mostly composed of New (?) Red Sandstone, capped
with Greenstone of variable composition and of great thickness in
some places.
   The Carboniferous Limestone(?) is stated to be very extensively
developed throughout the island, and to be very fossiliferous; the
author describes         its
                        lithological characters,    aswell    as
                                                               those  of  the
Devonian rocks and the Silurian slates       Mount Wellington, which
                                            of
last have,      yet, proved unfossiliferous;
                 as                              but     hestates that Mr.
Gould has found        Calymene Blumenbachii
                         a                         insimilar rocks   in   the
interior. He then, after describing the Coal-formation         ofthe island,
and remarking upon the anthracitic nature          the coal, passes
                                                   of                  on   to

cipally    felspathic trap and greenstone, imbedded

some parts, and       in
                     loam      in
                               others.  The boulders are also associated

 Dolomite.
   The author concludes by describing the mode of occurrence, in
 the valley of the Derwent, of a marine deposit which he considers of
 Postpliocene age, and which is found at an elevation of upwards of
          ft.
        above the sea-level, and                                at

 yards from the water's edge—thus showing that the valley     the
 Derwent and the neighbouring country had been recently upheaved.

 bling   a cannonade and the hissing of a cannon-ball through the air;
 some    describe it as having been in a state of incandescence, while
  others saw it dark and smoking. It penetrated into the ground to the
 depth of less than a “braccio" (about 2% Vienna feet), and was dug

 Troili, although quite uncertain as to the nature of the phenomenon,
 which he ascribes to a subterraneous commotion having thrown the
 stone into the air, whence it fell again to the ground, was evidently
 highly anxious to state its reality and every circumstance con
 cerning      it. This,       time when the scepticism about these phe

     5.   The hydrogen-flame                   was now substituted for the gas-flame;
the visible spectrum                     disappeared, and the deflection fell to
                                                         12°.
Hence, as regards rays of this particular refrangibility, the emis
sion from the luminous gas-flame was two-and-a-half times that
from the hydrogen-flame.
    6. The pile was now moved to and fro, and the movement in
both directions was accompanied by a diminished deflection.
Twelve degrees, therefore, was the maximum deflection for the
hydrogen-flame; and the position of the pile, determined pre
viously by means of the luminous flame, proves that this deflec
tion was produced by extra-red undulations.       I moved the pile a
little forwards, so as to reduce the deflection from 12° to 4°, and
then, in order to ascertain the refrangibility of the rays which
produced this small deflection, I relighted the gas. The recti
linear face of the pile was found invading the red. When the
pile was caused to pass successively through positions correspond
ing to the various colours of the spectrum, and to       extra-violet                  its
rays,       no

   15. The deflection of 60° here obtained is equivalent to 122
of the first degrees of the galvanometer.     Hence the intensity of
the obscure   rays  in the case of the full white heat is 122 times
that of the rays of the same refrangibility emitted by the dark
spiral used at the commencement.        Or, as the intensity is pro
portional to the square of the amplitude, the height of the aethe
real waves which produced the last deflection was eleven times
that of the waves which produced the first. The wave-length, of
course, remained the same throughout.

  21.   To the mixed radiation which             from solid bodies issues
at a very high temperature, the pure bisulphide of carbon is also
eminently transparent. , Hence, as the bisulphide of carbon                                        in
terferes but slightly with the obscure rays issuing from a highly
luminous source, and as the dissolved iodine seems not at all to
interfere with them, we have in a combination of both substances
a means of almost entirely detaching the purely thermal rays
from the luminous ones.
   22.  Ifvibrations of a long period, established when the radia
ting body is at a low temperature, maintain themselves, as
indicated in paragraph 14, side by side with the new periods
which augmented temperature introduces, it would follow that a
body once pervious to the radiation from any source must always
remain pervious to        it.

    24. To the luminous rays from the intensely white spiral the
 solution was perfectly opake; but though by the introduction
 of such rays the transmission, as expressed in parts of the total
 radiation, was diminished, the quantity absolutely transmitted
 was enormously increased.     The value of the last deflection is
 440 times that of the first; by raising therefore the platinum
 spiral from darkness to whiteness, we augment the intensity of
 the obscure rays which it emits in the ratio of 1:440.

Calculating from these measurements the proportion of lumi

   Repeated experiments may slightly alter these results, but they
are extremely near the truth.
   32. Having thus in the solution of iodine found a means of
 almost perfectly detaching the obscure from the luminous heat
 rays of any source, we are able to operate at will upon the former.
 Here are some illustrations:—The rock-salt lens was so placed in
 the camera that the coal points themselves and their image
 beyond the lens were equally distant from the latter. A battery
 of forty cells being employed, the track of the cone of rays emer
 gent from the lamp was plainly seen in the air, and their point
 of convergence therefore easily fixed. The cell containing the
 opake solution was now placed in front of the lamp.       The lumi
 mous cone was thereby entirely cut off, but the intolerable tem
 perature of the focus, when the hand was placed there, showed
  that the calorific rays were still transmitted. Thin plates of tin
  and zinc were placed successively in the dark focus and speedily
  fused; matches were ignited, gun-cotton exploded, and brown
  paper set on fire. Employing the iodine solution and a battery
  of sixty of Grove’s cells,          all
                                  these results were readily obtained

 mising arrangements which he has devised have had a sufficient
 trial.
    38. Melloni’s experiments led him to conclude that rock
 salt transmits obscure and luminous rays equally well, and that
 a solution of alum of moderate thickness entirely intercepts the
 invisible rays, while it allows             all
                                    the luminous ones       pass. Hence          to
 the difference between the transmissions of rock-salt and alum
 ought     give the obscure radiation.

 that     10
          per cent. only           of
                              the radiation from     oil-flame consistsan
 of  luminous rays.        The method above employed proves that

                      luminous heat        obscure,   to the case       in                       of    an

 made it.                               -

 inaccuracy         of
                 the conclusion that none but luminous rays are
 transmitted         by
                   alum; and the following experiments justify the
 clauses of limitation which he attached to his conclusion:—
    The solution              of

 the luminous rays being thereby intercepted.          Behind the rock
 salt cell containing    the  opake  solution was   placed   glass cell,          a
 empty     inthe first instance.    The deflection produced          the                         by
 obscure rays which passed through both produced                  deflec                   a

 The glass cell was now filled with                a                     alum;

 solutions was
                                                 50°.
 Calculating from the values                of
                                  these deflections,    was found that      it

 exist between the two phrases, “obscure rays,” and “rays from

opinion by proving the absence of silica in any quantity, and
indicating the presence of phosphoric acid; and consequently I

commenced, however, a systematic examination of the mineral,
but my sudden departure and prolonged absence in South Ame
rica has prevented my having had an opportunity of making the
results public until my recent return.

phous and without trace of crystallization; reniform or botryoi
dal; colourless or milk-white, and sometimes faintly tinged with
yellow or blue, and occasionally presenting iridescent hues; streak
white; translucent to semi-opake.     Lustre, vitreous or resinous;
splendid and waxy internally; very brittle.      Fracture semicon
choidal and  shining.
   Hardness 3-5 to 4, scratching calc-spar with facility but not
fluor-spar; one fragment, however, was found to leave a faint mark
on fluor-spar.

350              Mr.    J.    Bishop on the Influence of the Pitch                               of the
tones of the human voice in singing, it is of the greatest import
ance, not only that the pitch of the fork should be uniform, but
that it should be conformable to the structure and functions of
the human organs of voice, to which              other instruments         all                                       of
sound ought                 to   be
                      subordinate.

injurious these deviations have been         the vocal mechanism,

is  the object    the following remarks
                            of                show.
    The pitch having once been disturbed, the Philharmonic
 Society adopted     particular one, the Opera another, and then

   The following Table, with which have been supplied by the         I

statement that the       pitch   of C. has been arbitrarily raised, in
various    degrees in different countries, since the time of Handel,
and also that the Italian-Opera pitch is such as to render a great
deal of vocal music impossible to be sung by any vocalists except
those who possess an unusually extended compass; also that the
scale of the Society of Arts is too high for general use, and has
failed to produce that uniformity which was designed by                                                            its
members; and the question resolves itself into whether the slight

352      Mr.    J.   Bishop     on the Influence   of the Pitch of the
    Shortly after the commencement of the present century there
arrived in this country German performers on wind instruments
whose pitch was much more acute than that of our standard.
An opinion then prevailed that the tones of wind instruments
were improved by this higher pitch, and under this impression
the Philharmonic Society and the orchestral departments of
the theatres acceded to this strange notion, or what might rather
be termed delusion.
    The effect of this alteration in the fundamental pitch of music
has been very important.         The pianoforte-makers have been
obliged to shorten the strings of their instruments; the organ
builders to shorten their pipes; the flute-makers to cut off a por
tion of the length of their tubes; and what is termed the opera
pitch has transformed the C of the olden time into D; and since
 Nature has made no corresponding change in the length of the
cords of the vocal organs of the human race, it is manifest that                              t
 some changes must be made, either to adapt musical composi
 tions to the changes in musical pitch, or to reduce the standard
 pitch conformably to the structure of the human organs, in order
 to render their execution possible.
    It has been already stated that the greater portion of our best
 music was composed at a period when the tuning-fork made
 about 512 vibrations for C.       This is the case in the works of
 Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, and in the old madrigals and masses.
Let us suppose a person has a tenor voice whose limit on the
old scale of pitch is A. He can no longer sing the same music
when A is transformed into B.     Take, again, the soprano or alto,
where, with the new pitch, the music is rendered impossible of
execution.   We find accordingly that, in order to diminish the
evils which the present pitch has inflicted on the human voice, a
large number of Handel's and Mozart’s popular songs have been
transposed by Callcott and others into lower keys, so as to bring
them, for private use, into a pitch as near as possible to that in
                                                   it is,
use in the time of the composers.  This     however, only    partial               a
remedy for the much greater evil, since     leaves the entire works
of these great masters untouched        far  as relates      their per
                                                            as            to

of vocal harmony,   music was intended for   assemblages         choral            of
performers, and not merely for the few who possess such                                  an

   We come now        the effects produced
                       to                        the organs on    voice             of

by straining the vocal cords beyond their proper tension. A
young lady, endowed with a fine soprano voice reaching to C in
alt. or 1024 vibrations, by straining the vocal cords on that note
raised to D, lost the power of exercising her voice for musical
purposes during nearly three years. Even Madame Goldschmidt
complains of the strain which the change of pitch has produced
in her vocal organs; and it is well known what an extended
range of flute-like sounds this charming and accomplished singer
possessed.      Further, it is well known that the tones at the
extreme limits of phonation are never so pure in quality, or so
agreeable to listen to, as the notes within those limits; and
moreover, when in order to execute a given note the vocal cords
are stretched beyond their normal elastic length, they do not
always so readily regain their tone of elasticity; and if this be
permanently impaired, the voice loses some of              range     notes,its              of
and will     beunable      regain the power
                            to                     execute the melody

instruments intended          accompany
                                 to         the human voice should                                       be

compounds, or to the absence of them, the following point has
been allowed in practice—that a constant weight of any other
element, equivalent to a unit weight of hydrogen, shall be ac
cepted in the place of the latter, and be considered, equally with
it, a measure    the saturability

the occurrence of which will hardly be attributed to the di
equivalentic nature of oxygen.
   Again, certain chlorides, which are usually supposed to be
fully saturated, unite with water, a substance in which the di
equivalentic oxygen is understood to be completely satisfied.
Thus we have the hydrates
                                 LiCl         + nAq      (n=l or 27),

but not a hydrated chloride of potassium. The formation of
many double salts, and of direct combinations with water, appear
to me to be only explicable on the ground here proposed.
   This question is not verbal. Affinities are, tacitly at least,
taken into account in                all
                             our reasonings;         impossible for the

 in quantity equivalent to the force which had been expended in
 producing the tension.
    It seems impossible to form any satisfactory idea of the
 nature of the forces of attraction and repulsion; and after ages
 of research by intellects of the highest order the subject still
  remains enveloped in mystery.      Chemical forces seem to be spe
 cific properties  inherent in matter;  and the general forces of at
 traction and repulsion are by some considered as essential pro
 perties of ponderable matter, while others incline to attribute
 them to the action of a more subtle fluid medium present in all
 space, so that matter cannot be conceived of apart from the uni
 versal influence of this all-pervading fluid.   The force or vis viva
 of motion    may   be conceived of as  resulting  from an original
 impression of mechanical power on matter at           creation,                      its                     or    as

a   consequence       the action                         of attraction
 and repulsion resulting from primitive positions            disturbed

 form carbonic oxide and carbonic acid in the act of combustion,
 the particles must be brought so close together as to come within
 the spheres of chemical attraction under the influence of which
 they unite. It would be difficult to effect this approximation of
 the particles by gradually squeezing together the two bodies in
 mass, as general molecular repulsion increases to a powerful
 degree under the compression of matter; but in electricity and
 heat we possess agencies which, operating directly on the indivi
 dual particles of matter, can produce results of intensity of action
incomparably more powerful than can be effected by any mecha
 nical means which can be brought to bear on masses. Thus
the friction of a chemical match, by concentrating the mecha
nical action, is sufficient at a few points of actual molecular con
tact to generate a very high local temperature, which throws
 the excited particles into such violent molecular motion as to
impel them over the boundaries of repulsion fairly within the
sphere of chemical attraction.      Under the influence of this force
they combine with intense atomic action, which, communicating
from particle to particle, causes the rapid lighting of the whole
mass; and by the same play of molecular movements the phe
momena of fire or flame may be supposed to originate, from the
burning of the humblest rushlight to the most destructive con
flagration.

ticles formed in the act of combustion constitute the heat or
temperature of the flame, while solid particles of carbon, ren.

 and permanence which naturally present themselves to the unpre
judiced mind in contemplating these sublime phenomena.                     Now
  by an interesting coincidence it appears that, by supposing the
 meteoric theory so modified as to avoid the foregoing objection,
 it would result from this modification that terrestrial molecular
 motion may, in agreement with known physical laws, be con
 verted into the force of gravitation by the agencies of the meteoric
 phenomena, thus removing a strong objection which would other
 wise oppose the repulsion theory of thermo-dynamics which                  am                             I
 endeavouring to develope, while at the same time it supports the
 idea of a general cosmical stability and permanence.               In specu
 lations of this kind we cannot           expect  to arrive at conclusions
 beyond a mere preponderance of probability on one side or the
 other of any undecided point; and in such investigations the
 ardent study of the limited train of facts we possess inevitably
 leads into the regions of the unknown; for the vast field of
 research offers no boundaries; no one part of the subject can be
 fairly detached from the apparently endless circuit of connexions
 and relations with which it is bound; and in directing our ex
 perimental researches beyond the narrow limits of established
 fact in search of additional truth, it were unwise to reject- the
 suggestions of analogical probability.
    Radiant heat is supposed to be propagated in the same manner
as light. All bodies radiate heat, and every point of the surface
of each is a distinct centre from which undulations of the uni
versal aether proceed in straight lines in               directions without      all
interfering with each other,                         or

nity of our spiritual existence is gladly acknowledged by the
wisest and the best, and it is difficult to conceive of the anni
hilation of even common matter. It is probable that our planet
has already undergone changes the nature of which may never
be clearly revealed to human intelligence; and whenever the
great catastrophe may occur which is to change the present order
of terrestrial existence, is it not probable that the agencies em
ployed, though not opposing or inverting natural law, may still
differ essentially from the ordinary routine of physical phenomena
which, with a continual rotation of periodic change, conveys the
idea of general cosmical permanence 2
   Analogy would indicate the probability that the planets may
be receiving from the sun something more than mere motion, or
radiant heat and light, as generally described, and the idea is not
perhaps without support from physical facts.         The vital solar
fluid which reaches the earth may become, as it were, analyzed
and assimilated in the various active processes of nature by
which organisms are built up; whilst, besides radiant heat, there
is emanating from the earth into space a current of comparatively
effete cosmical matter which joins the general effluent solar tide,
carrying with it part of the vis viva of the terrestrial molecular
motion which we call heat, and another portion of this heat is
transferred by the universal aether, in the act of radiation, to the
solar tide. The accumulation of molecular motion on the earth’s
surface is thus prevented by a continual change into the vis viva
of the motion of translation of the effluent particles, which, with
the general solar tide in their outward progress, go on changing
this vis viva into potential energy of centripetal gravitation.
   There is reason to believe that the idea of a universal ocean of
interstellar aether has been entertained from the remotest times
of physical speculation; and this idea still prevails, being sup
ported by a strong preponderance of probability.       The undula-.
tory theory of light shows that the mighty pulse of this cosmical
vital fluid is beating throughout the universe at the amazing
rate of four hundred and seventy-four millions of millions of
strokes per second        All these pulsations are caught by the
delicate optical mechanism of the eye in a single second, and
the resulting impression is that of light. From this single mani
festation some faint idea may be conceived of the wonderful pro
perties which should characterize this cosmical fluid.      As com
pared with terrestrial matter, it is supposed to be imponderable
and comparatively non-resisting, and to be universally present.
   It is known that the sun has an atmosphere containing in a
state of vapour or gas several substances which exist on our
planet in a solid form. How far may the solar atmosphere be

The meteoric theory of the sun's heat has much probability in                                                     its

gradually thrown into orbital                          courses     which      might continue
for a long time under the influence of planetary laws. Finally,
the effect of the resisting medium causes the sun’s attraction
to preponderate more and more, and the great stream of meteoric
matter rolls on, gradually approaching the sun, in a vast spiral
vortex.   As graphically imagined by Prof. W. Thomson, “each
meteor thus goes on moving faster and faster, and getting
nearer and nearer the centre, until some time, very suddenly, it
gets so much entangled in the solar atmosphere as to begin to
lose velocity.   In a few seconds more it is at rest on the sun's
surface, and the energy given up is vibrated across the district
where it was gathered during so many ages, ultimately to pene
trate, as light, the remotest regions of space.”    It is supposed
that the  principal  store of energy which is to furnish future
sunlight is in the vis viva and the gravitating power of the
meteoric    bodies at present circulating inside the earth's orbit,
and   probably   giving origin to the zodiacal light.        However vast
these clouds of meteoric matter may be, analogy would certainly
indicate that their decrease from the fiery rain which they are
continually pouring down upon the sun should be made up from
some perennial source of supply, and also that some cosmical
process should prevent the continual growth of the sun’s mass
which would result from the conditions of the meteoric theory
in    itspresent apparently incomplete form.              the idea      theIf                   of

   The apparition of a star was indicated from one place to the
other by a touch of the telegraph, given at each place for each
star seen; and when the touches at both places were contempo

telegraphed to Rome, so that we were able to see at once what
parallax existed between the two stations.

       considering the changes of state through which the same
IN substance     may pass, we have been led to recognize, as an
important physical principle upon which the mechanical pro
perties manifested in each new condition in a great degree depend,
that the physical condition of the individual molecules is liable
to permanent variations from the effect of heat, and that these
variations consist in expansions of the electric atmospheres
which surround the atoms of the molecules.         we take a more                 If
extended view, and consider the diverse permanent changes of
condition which the same substance may experience while in
the same state of aggregation, we may discern the operation of
a still more comprehensive     principle, viz., that the physical
state of the atmosphere  of a molecule,  and therefore the curve
which represents               its
                     action upon surrounding molecules,      liable                               is               º

   From our present theoretical point        view, such possible        of
changes        of

    Another remarkable circumstance is the small horizontal distance
of these meteors: in no case did it exceed 222 kilometres, or 2
geographical degrees.   A somewhat curious consequence of this
is that no meteor seen from one of two stations, more than 444
kilometres asunder, can be identical with any of those seen from
the other.              If
                   the space that can be examined by an observer
from a given station were referred to a globe half a metre                                                      (in

                  should find that franc-piece would cover just

important physical principle upon which the mechanical pro

that the physical condition of the individual molecules is liable

variations consist in expansions of the electric atmospheres

nished force from the sides at which the atmosphere is expanded.
This follows, as a necessary consequence, from the fundamental
conception of molecular forces, developed on pages 199 to
204, as may be distinctly seen by attending to the values of
;   and r.   It will   thus be seen that the molecular atmospheres,
in assuming the spheroidal form, under special circumstances,
determine the existence of molecular axes of cohesive attraction,
“whose force is inversely related to their length.” In the direc
tion of such axes, then, the limit of stable equilibrium (Oa,
fig. 1, p. 203) will be least for the shorter axis, and greater for
                                                                      -
 the longer axis.
    When a force of pressure applied to a body determines a per
 manent compression, the molecular atmospheres remain com
 pressed, or in closer proximity to their central atoms, and the
force of cohesive attraction is permanently increased, and the
limit of stable equilibrium diminished. The heat developed is
a necessary result of the compression of the atmospheres.       If the
 elastic reaction to the   pressure  after it is withdrawn were per
fect, the atmospheres would resume their original form and
 dimensions, the original molecular forces would be recovered,
 and the heat evolved would be absorbed again. In general
when mechanical forces are applied to a body, the heat evolved,
or absorbed, is a necessary accompaniment of the compressions,
or expansions, superinduced in the atmospheres of the particles,
 and may be regarded as a sensible indication of the extent of
 such changes of molecular condition.        The mechanical work, of
which the heat evolved serves as the measure, is expended in
urging the atmospheres nearer to their central atoms.
    On the other hand, if heat be directly applied to a body, it
has a tendency opposite to that of a mechanical pressure, or to
expand the molecular atmospheres, and so to reduce the inten
sity of the cohesive attraction at a given distance.      It is to be
observed also that heat has a tendency to dissolve the groups in
which the particles of a solid may be aggregated, and, when the
point of fusion is reached, will effectually break up such groups
and bring the mass to the condition of a homogeneous and sym
metrical arrangement of molecules.
    Solidification, or Crystallization.—It is a well recognized prin
ciple that solidification and crystallization are the same process.
This great principle was first propounded by the learned and
acute Dr. Young in 1807, in his lectures on Natural Philosophy.
It has also been advocated by Biot and other physicists, and
more recently has been reasserted and ably sustained by Professor
Dana, in his admirable paper “On Cohesive Attraction,” pub
lished in vol.  iv. second series, of Silliman's Journal.  If  now it

be admitted that solidification is in every instance but a more or
less perfect crystallization, it will be perceived that the investi
gation of the mechanical process of crystallization must consist
 essentially in an inquiry into the conditions and results of the
 operation of the molecular forces under special circumstances.
 The general nature of these forces, and the laws of the variation
 of effective molecular action with the distance between two mo
 lecules, have already been under discussion. We have also seen
 (pp. 382, 383) that the mechanical condition of an individual
 molecule is subject to change under the operation of heat, and
 external forces generally, by reason of a change produced either
 in the dimensions or form of the atmosphere of the molecule,
and that it may thus acquire permanent axes of attractive force.
 To establish a sufficient basis for a general explanation of crys
 tallization, we have only to remark further that the molecule of
 every particular substance has primarily and inherently                    own                 its
 special physical condition,             virtueby      which     of
                                                                  exercises      it                    an
effective action that would                   be
                                     represented                      by

peculiar changes            of
                           mechanical condition.           Upon this idea                              it
 may   be  seen that every substance may have                              its

faces of these figures. We have then first to consider the pro
cess of crystallization as it may occur in a single plane.
   The result of every such process is the arrangement of the
molecules in the angular points of a series of quadrilaterals;
which may be squares, rectangles, rhombuses, or rhomboids.         If
we suppose, in the first instance, several molecules to unite along
a single line, and molecules posited on either side of this line to
unite with those already crystallized, three different general
modes of arrangement may occur: the new particles may take
up positions opposite those of the first line, or opposite the mid
dle points of the intervals between these particles, or opposite
                       j.
other than the middle points of these intervals.       In the first
case, squares or rectangles will be formed; in the second, rhom
buses, which may in special cases be squares; and in the third,
rhomboids,         in special cases may be rectangles.     The ge
neral tendency of the crystallization occurring along the first line
should be, by reason of the compression of the molecular atmo
spheres along this line, and the consequent expansion of them
in a direction perpendicular to        develope     axis  it,     to                      an             of   in

which crystallization occurs should become united with those
that take up their positions at the angles of the plane figure.
Thus two sets of four molecules in parallel planes may take up
positions of equilibrium at the eight angular points of a cube,
or six may form an octahedron, &c. The conditions that will
determine the figure of equilibrium assumed may be inferred
from the general considerations already presented (pp. 385 and
386). The compression of the molecular atmospheres in the
first plane of crystallization will tend to develope a third axis of
attraction perpendicular to this plane.          Various systems of crys
tallization are   possible,   since the    particles  on one side of the
first plane may take up positions of equilibrium perpendicularly
opposite to those that crystallize in this plane, or opposite the
intervals between parallel pairs of these particles, or opposite the
centre of the quadrilateral figure which they form *.
    Professor Dana has shown that the various fundamental forms
of crystals may be obtained by regarding the crystal as a mass
of bipolar molecules, of a spherical or spheroidal form, in con
tact along certain lines, which are the conjugate axes or conju
gate diameters of the spheroids. This conception of the consti
tution of a crystal                is,

to  that which has now been given.             For we have only         con

When a unites with b, the , =
heat given out will expand                       3-(º-º-º-º-º-º-
the atmosphere of c; and it
is possible that, after this effect has been produced, the expanded
atmosphere    will not become condensed, under the operation of
the  crystallizing   forces, as much as it otherwise would have
been, and hence that the molecular attractive force of c will
be less than would have otherwise resulted.      If the attraction
between b and c should thus be materially lessened, there
would be in consequence less heat evolved in the union of
the two, and so the attractive force of d would be less weak
ened than that of c has been.       Accordingly, in the union of
c and d an excess of heat would again be given out. In this
way a series of alternations in the intensity of the cohesive
attraction might be brought about along the line of crystallized
molecules.

     HIS little work is divided into two Parts. The first, intended
       as an outline of the general course of qualitative analysis,
begins with an enumeration and brief description of the more com
monly occurring elements; then follow concise directions for pre
paring and purifying the reagents required in the subsequent pro
cesses; and next about twenty-three pages devoted to “The Method
of Analysis.” The second Part consists of a series of examples for
practice in quantitative analysis, selected from among such sub
stances as are most likely to come in the way of an agricultural
chemist.
           It is
        this second part which gives to the book    distinctive cha                                its
racter and its chief value. The examples here given have been judi

who perhaps in most        cases have neither time nor inclination to
devote much attention to the study of chemistry for its own sake,
it would be unfair to charge upon it as a fault that it follows the
most commonly received system of instruction in the science, even
although we may be of opinion that that system is not the best
possible.
   We have exceedingly little to say in the way of adverse criticism
on the details of this work. Here and there, possibly, are signs of
somewhat hasty composition or correction: to this cause, for instance,
we attribute the occurrence of such an expression as “oil of vitriol
plus         its
          own bulk     water”      ofpage 77,            on

does     not produce a precipitate, is added to a solution of blood, the
 colour is quickly changed from red to brownish red, and in place of
 the original bands (fig. 1) we have a different system, nearly that of
 fig. 3. This system is highly characteristic; but in order to bring
 it out a larger quantity of substance is requisite than in the case of
 scarlet cruorine.       The figure does not exactly correspond to any one
 thickness, for the bands in the blue are best seen while the band in
 the red is still rather narrow and ill-defined at                edges, while the            its

    This difference of spectra shows that the colouring matter (haema
tine) obtained by acids is a product of the decomposition, or meta
morphosis of some kind, of the original colouring matter.
    When haematine is dissolved in alcohol containing acid, the spec
trum nearly agrees with that represented in fig. 3.
    12. Haematine is capable of reduction and oxidation like cruorine.
If  it be dissolved in a solution of ammonia or of carbonate of soda,
and a little of the iron salt already mentioned, or else of hydrosul
phate of ammonia, be added, a pair of very intense bands of absorp
tion is immediately developed (fig. 4). These bands are situated at
 about the same distance apart as those of scarlet cruorine, and are
no less sharp and distinctive.           They are a little more refrangible, a
clear   though    narrow interval    intervening      between the first of them
 and the line D. They differ much from the bands of cruorine in
 the relative strength of the first and second band.                  With cruorine
 the second band appears almost as soon as the first, on increasing the
 strength or thickness of the solution from zero onwards, and when
 both bands are well developed, the second band is decidedly broader
 than the first.     With reduced haematine, on the other hand, the first
 band is   already   black and intense by the time the second begins to
 appear; then both bands increase, the first retaining                      superiority        its

 blood would have been too dark for spectral analysis.                     The colour

substances, can be better judged of by the tint than by the use of
the prism.    With the prism the extreme sharpness of the bands of
scarlet cruorine is apt to mislead, and to induce the observer greatly
to exaggerate the relative proportion of that substance.
   Seeing then that the change of colour from arterial to venous
blood as far as it goes is in the direction of the change from scarlet
to purple cruorine, that scarlet cruorine is capable of reduction even
in the cold by substances present in the blood (§ 9), and that the
action of reducing agents upon it is greatly assisted by warmth
 (§ 7), we have every reason to believe that a portion of the cruorine
present in venous blood exists in the state of purple cruorine, and
is reoxidized in passing through the lungs.
    17. That it is only a rather small proportion of the cruorine pre
sent in venous blood which exists in the state of purple cruorine
under normal conditions of life and health, may be inferred, not only
from the colour, but directly from the results of the most recent
experiments *.     Were it otherwise, any extensive haemorrhage could
hardly fail to be fatal,        there       if,

                       ON       THE TEMPERATURE OF SEA-WATER.
                                  By M. chARLEs MARTINs”.
    Ihave read with great interest M. Edlund's Note on the Forma
tion of Ice in the Sea, published in the Archives des Sciences Natu- .
relles of July 20. His observations render it difficult not to admit
that ground-ice may be formed in salt water as well as in fresh.
The fact that, in nature, the temperature of sea-water descends
below zero without ice being formed can no longer be contested.
In the two voyages made in 1838 and 1839 by the corvette “La
Recherche” to Spitzbergen, I determined the temperatures at the
bottom of the sea in the neighbourhood of the glaciers, which, in
that region, often descend to the sea, and even advance, overhang
ing the surface of the water, to some distance from the coast. In
these experiments, published fifteen years ago in the Voyages de la

 mean temperature of 0°10 at the bottom of the sea.              At less depths
 I always observed higher temperatures.
     I place very little reliance on the two experiments of Professor
 Nordenskiöld.       They were made in winter, on the coasts of the
 Island of Aland—at a depth of 21 feet, and at a distance of 100 feet
 from the coast—with a single alcohol thermometer provided with a
 mercury index.       Neither the author nor M. Edlund describes the         in
 strument; they do not state whether it was protected from, or ex
 posed to pressure; and no proof is given that the unique indication
 derived from the bottom of the sea was exact.               I may venture to
 advise readers desirous of becoming acquainted with the minute
 precautions which, in experiments of this kind, are necessary in order
 to gain for the results the confidence of physicists, to refer to the
 memoir I published in 1848 and 1849 in the Voyages de “la Recherche,’
 and in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique. To avoid the incessant
 recommencement of the study of a question, it is necessary to con
 sult the works of those by whom we have been preceded.                  I have
 carefully analyzed those of Scoresby and of Parry, who, in 1811
 and 1827, had already observed, on many occasions, temperatures of
 the sea below zero, both at the surface and at depths varying from
 90 to 1314 metres. M. Edlund will find the tabular statement of
 them in my memoir.           Doubtless the procedure and the instruments
 of the   English  navigators   are not beyond the reach of criticism; but
 the fact of the depression, below zero, of the temperature of sea
 water was established by them at the above period, and has since
 been verified by other travellers.
  ON   THE ANCIENT AquEDUCT of ALATRI.                 BY FATHER SEcchi +.
    The town of Alatri, of Pelasgic origin, famous for its encircling
 walls of Cyclopean construction, is very ancient. Placed on the
 summit of a calcareous mountain, it was altogether deprived of
 water, and was separated from the nearest mountains by a valley,
 about 125 metres in depth. According to a celebrated inscription,
 the Censor L. Betilienus Varus conducted water to the town by
 means of an aqueduct 340 feet high, and for this purpose he caused
 arcades and strong pipes to be constructed: “fornices, fistulas solidas
fecit.” The recent researches, made by the order of His Holiness
 Pius IX., in order again to provide this important town with pota
 ble water, have led to the discovery of a large portion of the ancient
 aqueduct.     The levels which I have made show that the lowest
 point of the aqueduct was 110 metres below the highest part of the
 town; this accords with the 340 feet mentioned in the inscription.
 We have here, therefore, a water-conduit in the form of an inverted
 siphon, under a pressure of 11 atmospheres, constructed 160 years
 before our present era.       It is difficult to say what quantity of water
was conducted; but the dimensions of the aqueduct (the buttresses
of which measure l'75 by 1.45 metre) show that it must have been
 sufficient to supply the baths of the town, several public fountains,
 and the whole of the town itself, now found to be traversed with
pipes of lead and terra cotta. Near the Acropolis, pipes of bronze

 Rendus   of September    26, 1864.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.               407
have also been discovered, so that the fistulas solidas of the inscription
may possibly refer to pipes of this metal.
    It is remarkable that the pipes of terra cotta which have been
found agree precisely with the description given by Vitruvius (Archi
tura, lib. viii. cap. vii. no. 51). The aqueduct itself is constructed
according to the principles handed down to us by this author; for it
is carried along a horizontal line, at the level of the acropolis, to a
distance of about 7 kilometres; thence it descends, skirting the
mountain, until, after reaching its lowest point, it proceeds once
more horizontally for about 500 or 600 metres, and finally reascends
(see Vitruvius, ibid. no. 50). Thus the total length of the siphon
amounts to 5 or 6 kilometres.         All attempts to find the specus of the
aqueduct have been unsuccessful; for the demolition of these works
—caused in the first place by the barbarians, and afterwards by
peasants—has been enormous; the foundations alone have escaped
 destruction.     The metals discovered, however, appear in many
cases to indicate that the conduit was of a mixed kind; it is possible
that it was formed of different kinds of substances, corresponding
to the different heights to which the water was raised; for a large
portion of the water was arrested at half the above height.            Con
 structions in mortar, of great beauty and solidity, have been found,
 and it appears probable that the Romans were in the habit of
 strengthening their pipes, externally, by imbedding them in this mor
 tar  (in Italian, calce-struzzo).
     A  field was also discovered under which still exists a magnificent
 and complete system of drainage, by means of long lines of terra
 cotta pipes. These pipes have a mean diameterof 0:45 of a metre, their
 length being 1° 10 metre, and their thickness 0.025 of a metre.          At
 present they are filled with a water-sediment and with clay; their
 depth under the present soil is 2.50 metres, but it is evident that,
  originally, this depth was less and has since been increased by new
 soil.    The ends of the pipes overlap each other about 4 centi
 metres only.      No cement was used at their junctions; but spaces of
 about 1 centimetre were left, in order, probably, to facilitate filtra
 tion.     This field was probably the one used for military exercises, to
  which reference is made in the same inscription as being one of the
  interesting works of Betilienus.
     We have here, therefore, a complete system of drainage, resembling
  the modern one, but constructed twenty centuries ago, and still in
  a state of perfect conservation.     The utility of these works and the
  merits of the man of    genius  who constructed them are proved by the
  esteem in which he was       evidently  held by his fellow citizens.    He
  was twice elected       censor,  a statue was erected     to his memory,
  and his son was exempted from military service.
     As before observed, water is again about to be conducted to the
  town of Alatri.      The success of the modern conduits employed at
  Anagni, where the water rises at one bound to a height of 221 metres
  under the action of force-pumps, leaves no doubt whatever of the
  ultimate success of the projected constructions, where the new con
  duit will have a length of from 14 to 15 kilometres, and where the
  half of this space will be under a pressure of from 6 to 12 atmospheres.

               By Professor L. LoRENz, of Copenhagen”.
II    HAVE     communicated,     in a previous memoirit “On the
      Theory of Light,” certain theoretical investigations which
   have since continued and further developed.      But before enter
ing more fully upon the details of the results obtained,        may be I
allowed to take this opportunity of making a few remarks upon
the fundamental principles of the theory, and upon the particular
position which it occupies relatively to other theories.
    Researches into the region of mathematical physics bear wit
ness almost universally to a firm belief in the power of inductive
reasoning to penetrate to the forces concealed in the interior of
bodies, in order, starting from thence as from a centre, to con
struct the explanation and laws of phenomena.         This is the path
entered   upon  by Laplace    and those of his school: it was sup
posed that the problems of mathematical physics, like those of
astronomy, were accessible, even as to their innermost nature,
                                                                                of all
 by the inductive method.       Molecular forces have been in
cases assumed        the starting-point, which, like the forces
                        as
universal attraction, are supposed           to   be
                                              function

been sufficiently shown           by

conceptions respecting the nature            of

      sequences which could have been arrived at in no other way? and
      have these consequences always been correct?
         The Theory of Capillarity can be developed equally well with
      out these hypotheses; and the only result to which they have
      led is the principle discovered by Laplace and Poisson, that the
      height of liquids in capillary tubes at different temperatures is
      proportional to the densities of the liquids.    This principle, how
      ever, is false.   The same    assumption,  applied to the doctrine of
      Electricity, led Poisson to the determination of the relation
      between the two electric constants; but this conclusion also has
      turned out to be incorrect. Poisson’s calculation has been par
      tially altered, and the final deductions veiled under an unsummed
      summation-formula; but does such a result give us any right to
      consider the accuracy of our previous hypotheses as established f
         This assumption led, in Cauchy’s hands, to wonderful results
      by     its
             application    the theory     light.   Originally
                                                            it of
                                    to                            served                  it        to
      explain the dispersion       light;        of
                                             was, however,      once found           at
      that    materially vacuous space would disperse light, provided
             a a
      that    definite hypothesis was made regarding the nature        force                   of
       as
       a    function          of
                        the distance.    One would have supposed that                               so
      important     glimpse into the nature
                       a                                            of
                                                    molecular forces would
      necessarily lead     further to consequences;    but this was not the
      case.   On the contrary,     was found     itthis case        in
                                                                   others—           as   in
      for example,         in
                          the cases               of
                                        the hypotheses which        was neces        it
      sary    toadd      order
                         in       explain todouble refraction—that the new
      hypotheses were serviceable for those purposes only for which
      they had been invented: ulterior consequences could not and
      might not          be
                       drawn from them.
      I     will  not, however, dwell upon objections         this kind, since  of
      they have already been made, but still have not overthrown the
      theory. They have                   on
                                   their side only    certain degreea      pro                 of
      bability, while against them are ranged           the important    all

      which have hitherto been deduced from the theory. On the
      contrary,     Iwill lay stress upon new objection, inasmuch
                                                             a                                      as
            reality upsets the theory, while the great results      the theory       so of

      mistake       assuming that the mean values

like a physical theory: as well might we expect to deduce such
a theory from the phenomena of reflexion in a concave mirror or
from the refraction of a lens, as from diffraction or double refrac

of the propagation of light in homogeneous media can be deduced,
as well as the laws of diffraction (when this is not complicated
with simultaneous refraction and reflexion), those of interference,
of the polarization of the diffracted ray, and of the decrease of
the intensity of the light emitted by a luminous point with the
square of the distance.                          I
                                   need not now stay to discuss the man
ner in which these laws are deduced from the familiar equations,
          I
and will consider it as well known and established that the
equations are true for homogeneous media.               It results from the
form of the   integrals   that  light  may  be regarded  as a wave-motion,
without nevertheless our being able to form any kind of notion
as to the nature of this wave-motion, as must be sufficiently evi
dent from what has gone before.               The integrals further show
that o is the velocity of propagation.
    Passing on to heterogeneous bodies, we see at once that the
determination of the notions of intensity and plane of polarization
is to a certain extent arbitrary, inasmuch as these cannot be expe

only       we
          take the double sign arbitrarily,   Neumann did.                       as
Strictly speaking, Neumann started from the assumption that
the intensity     the incident light
                        of             equal   the intensity     is               to
of   all the refracted and reflected light; he, however, refers
this  assumption   back     the previous one.
                                      to         Conversely, there
fore,      we
           may conclude that our four limiting equations include
the  principle      of
                  the maintenance     the intensity, and hence that
                                                         of
our intensity equation,                by

 find the refractive ratio by means of the serial developments of the
 former memoir, that it can also assume this more general form;
 but it is difficult to indicate the conditions under which this will
 occur. It appears, however, that this case must arise when the
 interval between two similar points of a body is not small rela
 tively to the wave-length.      For this reason, for instance, a trans
 parent body ceases to be transparent when pulverized.

where p is the density of the substance, remains nearly constant
for the same body at different densities, and that the refractive
power of mixtures can be calculated from those of their separate
constituents by the formula

if p is the weight of the mixture, and the marked letters are
taken as applying to the several constituents of the mixture. An
additional law, which seems not to have been remarked, appears
from the same table of refractive powers (loc. cit. p. 211), namely,
that the refractive power always and without exception decreases
somewhat with the refractive index.         It was precisely the pre

          and     are two positive constants. The refractive
                           R
power therefore diminishes with the refractive index.
  The above formula,

In   a   similar manner we also obtain

    The present theory therefore does not only afford an expla–
nation of the constancy of the refractive power and of the for
mula for mixtures, but it defines these laws even more distinctly
than before, and in particular shows that the refractive power
must diminish with the refractive index: this is fully con
firemd by experiment.       And these results may suffice us on this
occasion; for it is needless to enter further into the details of
experiment, partly because it is self-evident that a closer agree
ment can be obtained with two constants than with one, and
partly because our formulae are yet only approximately true.
   In conclusion, it will not be uninteresting to see how the various
phenomena of light instruct us as to the internal constitution of
material bodies.      Double refraction indicates to us, in the first
place, the regular stratification of crystals, a character which is
also revealed by their external properties. The thickness of the
layers cannot, however, be deduced from double refraction, for
this would not cease even if the thickness were infinitely small;
circular polarization, on the other hand, and especially the
more general chromatic dispersion, prove that this is not the
case, and that in         all
                         bodies, the elastic fluids scarcely excepted,
there     is  stratification of measurable dimensions. Circular
                a
polarization further indicates want         a symmetry of  the interior         in
of  certain crystals,  which     likewise evidenced
                                     is                  their external     by
characters; and the rare occurrence           this kindof  polarization         of
teaches         us
             that such      wanta     symmetry
                                             of      not the common   is
case.    Finally, the refractive    power  indicates that the limit                                of
the periodicity       inthe interior     bodies   of    one side      is   on                    of   a
vacuum, and therefore that material bodies consist             separate              of
transparent molecules.

this compression of the molecular atmospheres, should, then, be
a source of heat.    Thus chemical combination of two particles
in which they are drawn into close union, collision of bodies,
external pressure, and friction are different sources of heat.
The disturbance of the electric equilibrium of contiguous mole
 cules may also give rise to the evolution of heat—by reason of
the increased repulsion exerted by the excess of electric aether
accumulated upon certain of the molecules, or upon one side of
 them, or of a discharge of the aether occurring from one molecule
 to another.
   Propagation of Heat.—Primarily the heat-pulses are developed
 in the universal aether associated with the atoms of bodies.
 These pulses may be conveyed outward through the universal
 aether posited between the atoms, and in this way be freely trans
 mitted through substances; or they may be more or less taken
 up or absorbed by the electric atmospheres of the molecules which
 they encounter.    Such absorbed pulses may be given out again
 or radiated in their original form, or they may pass on to conti
 guous molecules through the electric aether that pervades the  in
 terval between them.      Itis probably in this latter mode chiefly
 that heat is conducted from particle to particle of a substance,
though the pulses that are given out by any particle to the sur
rounding universal aether may be in part propagated onward,
absorbed by the particles they encounter, and partially propa
gated onward again in the same manner to the next particles.
    The flow of heat from one particle to another of a substance
tends to disturb the electric condition of the particles; for the
repulsive action of the heat-pulses in the atmosphere of one
particle tends to urge away a portion of the electric aether from
the contiguous side of the next particle in the line of propaga
tion, and so to induce a negative electric state upon that side,
and a positive state on the further side. This disturbance of the
electric equilibrium of contiguous molecules may give rise to a
discharge of the electric aether from the one to the other, and a
consequent more ready propagation of the heat-pulses from the
one to the other.      Upon this idea there is a close analogy
between the conduction of heat and the conduction of electricity
in the galvanic current, both depending upon the facility with
which an electric polarization of contiguous particles is deter
mined. The origin of this propagated polarization in the one
case is the addition of repulsive pulses to the atmosphere of a
molecule, and in the other the accumulation of an excess of the
repulsive electric aether around a molecule or upon one side of
it.   Aconfirmation   ofthese views   isafforded  by
                                                   certain pheno

conduction  ofheat   is  reality attended with the disturbance

fact of the close agreement that subsists between the conducting
powers of the metals for heat and electricity.                 The analogy
between the conduction of heat and the conduction of a galvanic

greater intensity, are capable of penetrating to the atoms of
the medium and exercising a calorific action upon them.
    It is generally admitted that vision is produced by the trans
verse vibrations of the rays of light. The fact that when two
rays of heat, polarized in perpendicular planes, meet in opposite
states of vibration they do not neutralize each other, has been
generally regarded as an indication that the calorific action of a
ray must also result from transverse vibrations; but this does
not appear to be a legitimate conclusion, if we adopt Professor
Challis's theory, that the luminiferous aether is a highly elastic
fluid, having the same properties as elastic fluids in general, and
that the aethereal undulations consist of simultaneous longitudinal
and transverse vibrations, attended with variations in the density
of the medium, as in the case of waves of sound. For if trans
verse vibrations, in perpendicular planes, meet in opposite states
they cannot neutralize each other, and must develope direct vibra
tions, which will take the place of those which counteract each
other and will exert a calorific action. In fact Prof. Challis con
ceives that “heat is the result of the mechanical action of the direct
vibrations;” while “light is due to the transverse vibrations.”
   The intimate association of heat and light leads to the infer
ence that they emanate from the same source, viz. the mole
cular atmospheres of bodies; and         if,
                                        has been intimated, the
                                               as
two emanations are essentially the same, we infer that rays
light  as  well  of as   heat originate     in  vibratory movements                       at of of
the atomettes       ofthese  atmospheres.       The atomettes lying
different distances from the central atom of molecule will have
                                                         a
different rates  of vibration, increasing with the distance; and                          so
the waves   proceeding    from them will have every variety              pul        of
sation between the lowest        limit,  answering           to
                                                           the  bottom,  and
the highest, answering         the top
                                  to        of   amolecular atmosphere.
Accordingly the red rays will proceed from the lower portions
of  the atmosphere, and the violet from more elevated portions.

tinuity    ofthe  rays  between the two extremes.            But we know,
from the existence      ofbright   bands    inthe spectra obtained from
coloured flames and from the highly heated vapours                    metals   of

insensible degrees from one extreme              tothe other. We must.
conclude therefore that the electric atmospheres              highly heated

In  order that a ray may be completely absorbed, it must en
counter a layer of the electric atmosphere of a molecule which
pulsates naturally in unison with the wave-pulsation of the ray.
The absorbing action of a molecule should therefore depend upon
the physical condition of                          its     pulsation,

rous facts, which go to show that the absorptive action of media
upon light and heat depends in a great degree upon the physical
constitution of the separate molecules, confirm this conclusion.
   The general phenomena and laws of reflexion, refraction,
polarization, diffraction, &c., should obtain upon this supposi
tion no less than upon the conception that the phenomena are
to be referred to the interstitial aether. It remains to be seen
whether the theorems and formulae deduced by Fresnel and
other physicists from the undulatory theory of light, can be
shown to be substantially in accordance with this notion of
molecular actions.
   Note.—Objections to the theoretical views offered in the pre
ceding pages will readily occur to the scientific reader; but it
does not comport with the design of the present communication
to anticipate objections, or to attempt to enforce the general
conclusions deduced from the fundamental positions taken by
appeals to special facts.   We must be content for the present to
rest our conclusions mainly upon general considerations. A
 connected view of the whole ground to be surveyed is almost a
 necessary preliminary to the many detailed investigations that
must be undertaken before the theory can be established on a
firm foundation.
   It will                                                of the
             be perceived that the most characteristic feature
general theory under discussion is that it locates the source of
physical phenomena in the atmospheres of molecules, instead of
in the atoms or in the interstitial aether. In pursuing our de
ductions into other departments of physics, other general con
ceptions have been reached, some of which it may be advisable
 to state here, as circumstances may delay somewhat the publi
 cation of the remainder of the article.

 its origin  in the opposite polarization      ofthe adjacent sides          of
contiguous molecules, developed         by  the play         of

   3. Induction-currents result from an electric polarization of the
molecules, suddenly induced by the same lateral action of a
primary current when first established,        or by the increased
action of a  previous electric or   magnetic  current—or suddenly
vanishing when the current is broken, or the force of action
decreases.    The polarization in the first instance is the opposite
to that which prevails in the primary current, owing to the
indirect nature of the inducing action.
   4. The circular currents of a magnet consist of electric currents
that follow continuous chains of particles lying in the surface of
the compound molecules of the magnet. These currents have
their origin in an electric polarization of the particles, developed
by a direct action of the impulses propagated from the exciting
current.    In permanent magnets the polarization thus originated
becomes permanently established,        and a permanent current
remains as a necessary consequence of the play of the molecular
forces in the chain.      A magnet therefore derives             power directly its
from the inexhaustible primary forces                attraction and repulsion,

diameters were about             centimetres

  On   some curious       Effects of the Molecular Forces   of Liquids. 435
ground; for otherwise    either the liquid sheet will not have
time to resolve itself into hollow spheres, or, should these
spheres be produced, it will be found impossible to observe
them and to notice their rupture.
   This experiment fully confirms the conclusion arrived at by
M. Félix Plateau, according to whom the simultaneous agglo
meration of liquid molecules into perfectly closed envelopes
cannot be regarded as a necessary condition of the formation of
vesicles; the admission of the generation of unclosed films of any
curvature whatever will suffice—a generation which assuredly
involves no impossibility.     Without doubt the question of the
duration of the bubbles remains to be resolved.        The larger
ones, it is true, burst in less than a second; but do the smaller
spherules likewise do so? I have not been able to establish this
point, in consequence of the difficulty of judging whether these
small spheres are full or empty—a difficulty which is increased
by the circumstance that the envelope is much thicker than that
of the bubbles of soap-water.
   Apart from the meteorological question, the application of
the procedure above described to different kinds of liquid ap
peared to me to possess some interest.        I first tried soap-water,
 and thus found that       although  bubbles form themselves very
 well, their diameters are not great; and moreover they burst
 as rapidly as when pure water is employed.                 If
                                                          these results
 differ from those described      by M. Félix    Plateau,   it is merely
because, instead of turning rapidly round on projecting the
           I
liquid, simply threw it with a relatively moderate velocity, so
that the sheet was much less broad, and much thicker.                 I
                                                                     tried
 also a  very great  velocity,  so as to render the sheet     very  thin,
and    I  then obtained a very great number of small spheres
accompanied by some very light bubbles more or less large and
pretty durable;       I
                      even succeeded, by rapidly projecting a con
centrated solution of soap (qui s'était prise en gelée), in pro
ducing three bubbles, the largest of which had a diameter of
at least 25 centimetres, whilst that of the two others amounted
to about 8 or 10;           all
                            three had     duration
                                            a             about half
                                                            of            a
minute.
    My method succeeds very well with alcohol, though the bub
bles burst very quickly.       Amongst the volatile oils,       operated
                                                                  I

                                                I

                      a

the aether in which this matter is immersed. Regarding the
motions of the aether itself, as illustrated by the phenomena of
reflexion, refraction, interference, and diffraction, the optical
investigations of the last half century have left nothing to be
desired; but as regards the atoms and molecules, whence issue
the undulations of light and heat, and their relations to the
medium which they move, and by which they are set in motion,
these investigations teach us nothing.      To come closer to the
origin of the aethereal waves—to get, if possible, some experi
mental hold of the oscillating atoms themselves—has been the
main object of the researches in which      have been engaged for   I
the last five years.    In these researches radiant heat has been
used as an instrument for exploring molecular condition, and
                                           I
this is the object which have kept constantly in view throughout
the investigation which I have now the honour to submit to the
Royal Society.
   The first part of these researches is devoted to the more com
plete examination of a subject which was briefly touched upon
at the conclusion of my fourth memoir—namely, the action of
liquids, as compared with that of their vapours, upon radiant
heat.    The differences which exist between different gaseous
molecules, as regards their power of emitting and absorbing
radiant heat, have been already amply illustrated.     When a gas
is condensed to a    liquid, the molecules approach and grapple
with each other by forces which are insensible as long as the
gaseous state is maintained.     But though thus condensed and
enthralled, the aether still surrounds the molecules.        then,                        If,
the powers      radiation and absorption depend upon them indi

               may expect that the deportment towards radiant

cule, will maintain itself after the molecule has relinquished                                     its

    In  these experiments            I   employed a less delicate galvanometer
 than that used in        my    former researches.                 The experiments were

  Had it been desirable to push these measurements to the
utmost limit of accuracy,                       I
                              should have repeated each experi
ment, and taken the mean of the determinations. But consi
dering the way in which the different thicknesses check each
other, an inspection of the Table must produce the conviction
that the results express, within small limits- of error, the action
of the bodies mentioned.
§   III.     Absorption            of radiant heat of the same quality                     by the
                   vapours        of those liquids at a common tension.
   As liquids, then, those bodies are shown to possess very
different capacities of intercepting the heat emitted by our radia
ting source; and we have next to inquire whether these differ
ences continue after the molecules have been released from the
bond of cohesion. We must, of course, test the vapours by waves
of the same period as those applied to the liquids; and this our
mode of experiment renders easy of accomplishment. The heat
generated in a wire by a current of a given strength being inva
riable, it was only necessary, by means of the tangent compass
and rheocord, to keep the current constant from day to day in
order to obtain, both as regards quantity and quality, an invari
able source            of heat.
    The liquids from which the vapours were derived were placed
in a small long flask, a separate flask being devoted to each.
The        air

mental tube        which the   vapours   were          examined.    Thisto   be

                   of                                          diameter,           in
its two ends being stopped           plates         by

surface was   polished.    At the commencement         each experiment,      of
the tube having been thoroughly cleansed and exhausted, the

 attached      the tube was finely graduated, and the descent
                   to                                                 the                    of

   The agreement,        it will be seen, is as perfect as could be
desired.
   Augmenting the opening through which the heat passed from
the source into the experimental tube, the total heat was increased,
and the experiments with a few of the vapours were repeated.
The total heat in the last case produced a deflection of 78°, which
is equal to 350 units; the total heat now employed produced a
deflection of 83°, which is equal to 605 units.                 It is easy to see
that the   experiments      now to be recorded furnish a direct check
on the calibration of the galvanometer.                 As long as the quality
of the heat remains unchanged, the absorption ought to be the
same with a high total heat as with a low one.                     But if experi
ment show that this is the case, it              proves  also that the calibra
tion on which the calculation of the absorption depends, cannot
be in error. The following results were obtained on the 8th of
October:—

The differences here are inconsiderable, and lean to neither side;
within these limits, therefore, the calibration must be correct;    it
shall be tested more severely in another part of this paper.
§ IV. Absorption of the  same heat by the same vapours when the
  quantitiesof  vapour are proportional to the quantities of liquid.
  —Comparative view of the action of liquids and their vapours on
  radiant heat.
   We are now in a condition to compare the action of a series
of volatile liquids with that of the vapours of those liquids upon
radiant heat.
  Commencing with the substance of the lowest absorptive
energy, and proceeding to the highest, we have the following
order of absorption        :-
                Liquids.                          Vapours.
     Bisulphide of carbon.                Bisulphide of carbon.
     Chloroform.                          Chloroform.
     Iodide of methyle.                   Iodide of methyle.
     Iodide of ethyle.                    Iodide of ethyle.
     Benzole.                             Benzole.
     Amylene.                             Amylene.
     Sulphuric ether.                     Alcohol.
     Acetic ether.                        Formic ether.
     Formic ether.                        Sulphuric ether.
     Alcohol.                             Acetic ether.
     Water.
   Here,  as far as amylene, the order of absorption is the same
for both  liquids and vapours.      But from amylene downwards,
though strong liquid absorption is in a general way paralleled
by strong vapour absorption, the order of both is not the same.
There is not the slightest doubt that next to water alcohol is the
most powerful absorber in the list of liquids; but there is just
as little doubt that the position which it occupies in the list of
vapours is the correct one. This has been established by reite
rated experiments.     Acetic ether, on the other hand, though
certainly the most energetic absorber in the state of vapour, falls
behind both formic ether and alcohol in the liquid state.        Still,
on the   whole,   I
                  think it is impossible to contemplate  these results
without arriving at the general conclusion that the act of absorp
                                                                     of its
tion is in the main molecular, and that the molecule maintains
power   as   anabsorber and radiator when    it  changes     its
                                                              state
aggregation. Should, however, any doubt linger          as   the cor
                                                             to
rectness   ofthis conclusion,    will speedily disappear.
                                it

     A  moment's reflection will show that the comparison here         in
  stituted is not a strict one.      We have taken the liquids at a
  common thickness, and the vapours at a common volume and
  pressure.    But if the layers of liquid employed were turned
  bodily into vapour, the volumes obtained would not be the same.
  Hence the quantities of matter traversed by the radiant heat are
 neither equal nor proportional to each other in the two cases;
 and to render the comparison strict they ought to be propor
 tional.    It is easy, of course, to make them so; for the liquids
 being examined at a constant volume, their specific gravities
 give us the relative quantities of matter traversed by the radiant
 heat, and from these and the vapour-densities we can immedi
 ately deduce the corresponding volumes of the vapour.            Calling
 the quantity of matter q, the vapour-density d, and the volume
 W, we have
                                     Wd=q,
 Or

                                     v=}
 Dividing, therefore, the specific gravities of our liquids by the
 densities of their vapours, we obtain a series of volumes propor
 tional to the masses of the liquids employed.          The densities of
 both liquids and vapours are given in the following Table:—

    Here the discrepancies revealed by our former series of expe
riments entirely disappear, and it is proved that for heat of the
same quality the order of absorption for liquids and their vapours
is the same. We may therefore safely infer that the position of
a vapour as an absorber or radiator is determined by that of the
liquid from which it is derived.         Granting the validity of this

From the first seven Tables of this memoir, or from the résumé

not sensibly affected by the addition of the iodine. The lumi
mous heat was of course cut off; but this, as compared with the
whole radiation, was so small as to be insensible in the expe
riments.
   It is known that iodine dissolves freely in the bisulphide of
carbon, the colour of the solution in thin layers being a splendid
purple; but in layers of moderate thickness it may be rendered
perfectly opake to light.    I dissolved in the liquid a quantity of
the iodine  sufficient, when introduced into a cell 0:07 of an inch
wide, to cut off wholly the light of the most brilliant gas-flame.
Comparing the opake solution with the transparent bisulphide,
the following results were obtained:—

Here the presence of a quantity of iodine, perfectly opake to a
brilliant light, was without measurable effect upon the heat
emanating from our platinum spiral. The liquid was sensibly
thickened by the quantity of iodine dissolved in                                      it.

   To what, then, are we to ascribe the deportment of iodine
towards luminous and obscure heat f The difference between
both qualities of heat is simply one of period: in the one case
the waves which convey the energy are short and of rapid recur
rence; in the other case they are long and of slow recurrence.
The former are intercepted by the iodine, and the latter are
allowed to pass.      Why? There can, I think, be only one answer
to this   question—that     the intercepted waves are these whose
periods coincide with the periods of oscillation possible to the
atoms of the dissolved iodine.        Supposing waves of any period
to  impinge   upon  an assemblage    of molecules of any other period,
it         is,

1   +6=     j,    which can only be objected to on two grounds—viz.
that some (or all) of the quantities assumed as constant are not
rigorously constant, and that the usual mechanical theory of
sound is not rigorously correct; and both objections would be
irrelevant to the present purpose.
  Lastly, the assertion that “the two capacities are necessarily
equal,” appears at first sight to mean that c and c' are neces
sarily equal. But as the author cannot have intended to deduce
this conclusion from a fact which proves that c and c' are neces
sarily unequal, it is probable that he only meant to say that when
heat is spent upon a given quantity of gas, how much of it goes
to make the gas hot depends only upon the change of tempera
ture.   If this be so, the language used is very inaccurate, and
almost certain to mislead an ordinary student.

really did mean to say that Regnault had proved experimentally

   The words physic, physical, physiology, come from the Greek
representatives         of

early contrasted with artificial creation; but in later times, per
haps under the influence of Plato, the Greek derivatives have
more emphatically suggested a contrast with things supposed to

The dots   (...), indicating            an elision, stand for the words in omni                              in
strumentorum usu.   Now,                    I
                            cannot help thinking that the omis
sion of these words completely alters the meaning of the above
passage.   Newton, in the passages preceding the above, is bent
upon showing that the effective force of a moving system may
be measured by            its
                        momentum (mv); and           states that this as   he

                                         or
subtracted. “Caeterum mechanicam tractare,” Newton adds, “non
est hujus instituti.     Hisce volui tantúm ostendere, quam late
pateat quamgue certa                   sit

important, cannot but                  be

   In his ‘Life of Newton,” Sir D. Brewster states (vol. i.
p. 268):—“Kepler could not fail to suspect that some power
resided in [the sun] by which the motions of the planets were
produced; and he went so far as to conjecture that this power
diminishes as the square of the distance of the body on which
it is exerted; but he immediately rejects this law in favour of
that of the simple distances.” Again, further on (p. 282):-
“Bouillaud maintained that the force of attraction must vary
reciprocally as the square, and not, as Kepler asserted, in the
simple ratio of the distance.” In a similar manner, Sir I. Newton
stated (see Rigaud's Hist. Essay, App. p. 32):-‘‘Bullialdus
wrote that               all
                  force, respecting the sun           centre     must         as    its         .    .   .

occasuad ortum ; et quoniam ut dictum est motus circularis
naturaliter quemdam imprimit impetum ipsi mobili, quo me
diante a centro removetur, atque expellitur, veluti in funda ac
rota observare licet, ergo, dum praedictus planeta circulariter
rotatur, removebitur à centro Solis. . . Proindeque his aderunt
duo motus directi inter se contrarii, alter perpetuus, ac uni
formis, quo planeta impulsus a propria magnetica virtute sibi
connaturali vero successive admovet solaricorpori, alter verö dif
formis, et continuedecrescens, quo planeta à puncto(E)expellitur.”
Again (p. 78): “Ut dictum est, virtus motiva planetae . . . com
ponitur ex circulari impulsu, et gradu virtutis prementis uni
formis, et ex gradu virtutis repellentis;” and (p. 81):—“Ut
suppomamus praedictum motum . . . . pendere a magnetica im
pellente virtute . . . , et motum circularem planetae circa Solem.”
Hence, it is certainly evident that Borelli extended the idea of
gravitation also to the sun (as a one-sided action); but then it
is equally evident also that he supposed the attraction of gravity
to be uniform, i. e. independent of distance (as may be seen more
at large in the passages omitted from the above quotation),           and
further, that he considered the motions of the planets to be the
result of three forces—one circular, the other centrifugal, and
the third attractive or centripetal. According to our present
notions, a force acting circularly is impossible; and a centripetal
force, although the expression is still used, is no force at all, but
only a tendency produced by the possible resolution of velocities;
whilst the motions of the planets are supposed be the result
of an attractive force acting conjointly with certain impressed
tangential velocities.                                        -

    I  have stated, in the Bakerian Lecture read at the Royal Society
on    April 10, 1862, that the boomerang (prominence E)* was not
depicted on Señor Aguilar's photographs.         This is true of the prints
which came into     my  hands in  England.     A visit to Rome in Novem
ber 1862, however, afforded an opportunity for the examination of
the first prints which had been taken in Spain on the day of the

that of mine; it is a little nearer the moon’sedge at the point c,
probably because the telescope was uncovered relatively a little later
than at Rivabellosa.
   The prominence D cannot be clearly traced in the S. photograph.
   The boomerang E is distinctly visible in the S. photograph; the
point e is apparently prolonged ; but this I attribute to an accidental
photographic stain, for the bright part e' can be well made out.
   The long prominence F cannot be made out in the S. photograph,
probably from the cause explained in reference to C.
   The fallen tree (H in the S. photograph) corresponds in                                                                   its

A LETTER FROM JOHN       DAVY, M.D., F.R.S., TO THE EDITORS OF
  THE       PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE     IN REPLY TO CERTAIN
  CHARGES MADE BY C. BABBAGE,                              ESQ., F.R.S., ETC., AGAINST
  THE LATE sIR HUMPHRY DAvy, when PRESIDENT                                             of THE
  ROYAL SOCIETY.
        GENTLEMEN,-
          BABBAGE, in his recently published work, “Passages from
MR. the life of a Philosopher,’     has brought two charges against the
late Sir Humphry   Davy,  when President of the Royal Society, both of
them  injurious to his character, if substantiated:—one, of a breach of
promise; the other, of “transferring between three and four hundred
pounds from the funds of the Royal Society into his own pocket”.
   These charges are contained in the thirteenth Chapter, under the
heading of “Recollections of Wollaston, Davy, and Rogers,” and
are incongruously associated with an account of “The Thauma
trope,” and with anecdotes of the poet.        Mr. Babbage, in his Pre
face to another workt, expresses the opinion “that the famous
maxim de mortuis nihil nisi bonum, appears to savour more of female
weakness than of manly reason.”         In these his “recollections,” or
rather his assertions, so far as they relate to Sir Humphry Davy, he
strictly confines himself to nihil nisi malum.
    As the brother of Sir Humphry Davy, will you allow me to reply
to these charges in your pages;               I
                                     shall endeavour to be as brief as
the subject will permit.
    First, of the breach of promise.—Mr. Babbage's statement is the
following:—“In 1826 one of the Secretaryships of the Royal So
 ciety became vacant.    Dr. Wollaston, and several other of the lead
ing members of the Society and of the Council wished that I should
be appointed.      This would have been the more agreeable to me,
because my early friend Herschel was at that time the senior Secre
tary.
   “This arrangement was agreed to by Sir Humphry Davy, and I
left town with the full assurance that I was to have the appoint
ment.    In the mean time Sir Humphry Davy summoned a Council
at an unusual hour—eight o'clock in the evening—for a special pur
pose, some arrangements of the Treasurer's accounts.
  “After the business relating to the Treasurer was got through, Sir
Humphry Davy observed that there was a Secretaryship vacant, and
                     fill                                                             H.
he proposed to        up.
                     it      Dr. Wollaston then asked Sir      Davy                                 if
 he claimed the nomination        rightas
                                       a   the  President,
                                                       of    which Sir            to
H. Davy replied that            he
                            did, and then nominated Mr. Children.
                                        such right, and even
                                                                                            be he
The President,    President, had
                     as                           no               had                 if
possessed    it,   he
                had promised Mr. Herschel that     should     his          I
colleague.  There were upright and eminent men      that Council;            on
yet not one   them had the moral courage
                of                         oppose the President's

  Mr. Herschel, now Sir John Herschel, was one     those present;                               of

                                          I                            he

H.   Davy   had been     long        so

  I   shall now proceed to the more serious charge—the asserted
“transfer of between three and four hundred pounds from the funds
of the Royal Society into his [Sir H. Davy's] own pocket”*. This
charge, according to Mr. Babbage's statement, is founded on the
facts (and I do not question their accuracy) that the late Mr. Mur
ray purchased for 500 guineas the copyright of the President's Dis
courses, which were published at the request of the Councilt, and
that the Council, at a meeting held on the 31st of December, 1826,
“Resolved, that 500 copies of the President's Discourses about to be
printed by Mr. Murray be purchased by the Society at the usual
trade price.”   At that meeting the President was in the chair; the
members present were Captain Beaufort, Messrs. Brown, Children,
Gilbert, and Herschel, Sir E. Home, Captain Kater, Drs. Pearson,
Prout, and Young. Mr. Babbage, in commenting on the transac
tion, exculpates Mr. Murray; the gravamen of the charge he lays
on the President and the Council—he for selling the copyright of
his Discourses (which he certainly had a right to do) and the Council
for ordering the purchase of the copies at a cost of £381 5s.
   Mr. Babbage states that in the following year, when he was on
the Council, he inquired why the “Resolution of Council’ above
named was passed; and that Dr. Young's reply was, that it was
“in order to induce Mr. Murray to print the President's speeches.”
   It would appear from the wording of the resolution, that, previous
to   its
       passing, Mr. Murray had undertaken      publish the Discourses;             to
nor does      appear that there was any previous promise
                 it                                           Be that                                           ?
as   itmay, the Council was responsible for their act.
I    have recently applied     Mr. John Murray, the son
                                                    to         the late                                             of

an accusation should have been brought against him equivalent to
that of robbery, and that stated to have been committed in the last

   It may be asked why I did not reply to this last charge at the
time it was first made, viz. in 1830, in Mr. Babbage’s “Reflections
on the Decline of Science in England and on some of its Causes.’
I was   then abroad on foreign service, and did not return until the
lapse of two years. Then Mr. Babbage's book had almost passed
into oblivion: moreover, as the Council of the Royal Society were
included in the charge,       members (they  its many and able) might
 be considered the   proper  persons    reply     it; indeed, even now,

   The unsoundness      this inference will appear from the following
                                    of
considerations.
   By reducing the French barometer we obtain the length                                                       of    a

same column of mercury, at the same temperature, estimated in
English inches, at the standard temperature of 62°F.
  From Guyot's Tables for the conversion of millimetres into English
inches, and vice versá, we express millimetres at the standard tem
perature of 0°C. in terms of English inches at the standard tempe
rature of 62°F.
   The consequence is that the reading of the French barometer, when
reduced and converted into English inches by Guyot's Tables, ought
always to coincide exactly with the reading of the English barometer.
   From the following further quotation from Mr. Packe's paper, it
is easy to see how he has arrived at a different conclusion:—
   “For exact observation, therefore, it is useless to have a barometer
 marked with a double scale—the French and English: they cannot
 be made to coincide; e. g.
   “Let the barometer read 29 inches = 736'59 millims. (temp.
 62°F. = 16*67 C.). In the English scale at 62° (the temperature
of the standard) no correction is made for the brass scale.                       The only
correction is for the expansion of the mercury, -'087,
                                          in.

                             reduced 28'913            =   734'38 millims.
   “But in the French scale, the temperature of the standard being
32°F., the correction tobe made is for the expansion of the mer
cury — the expansion of the scale:
                                                                      mim.

   Mr. Packe evidently supposes that in a barometer with a double
 scale, when the attached thermometer is at 62°F. = 16*67 C., and
 the English reading is 29 inches, the metrical reading will be 736'59
 millims.
   Now, if the metrical                                    will not be the
                            scale is properly graduated, this
 case. 736'59 millims. is what the reading would be if the metrical
 scale were at its standard temperature of 0°C.        But by hypothesis
 it is at 62°F.;   it has therefore  expanded  through   the space due to
 an increase of  temperature   of 30° F., that    through      is,

             OBSERVATIONS OF THE SPECTRUM OF JUPITER.
           LETTER FROM FATHER SECCHI TO M. DE BEAUMONT.
    In my last communication on the spectra of the celestial bodies I
 gave new observations, which confirmed for the planet Jupiter the
 existence of special bands due to its atmosphere.            I said that I
 hoped to be able to measure these bands with the greatest precision,
 and to learn whether or not they coincided with the terrestrial atmo
 spheric bands.    I can now communicate the result of these measure
 ments.                                 -
    To obtain them I constructed specially an excellent astronomic
 micrometer, with a screw having a thread of four-tenths of a milli
metre, the cross wires being replaced by a metal plate with a very
fine slit. This single slit is used instead of the graduated scale of
 the spectroscope which I used last year; it is illuminated in the
 same manner with light graduated at will; by moving the head of
the screw, which is divided into 100 parts, this luminous line may
be made to coincide with an obscure band or any given ray; but as
 its light would efface the obscure ray          extended throughout the
                                                      if
spectrum,      its
               length was limited         that   so        it it
                                                   only encroached upon                            it
                                                                                           of In
to  about one-third         or
                         one-fourth    the length
                                                of      the latter.   ofthis
way the micrometric line could             placedbe    continuation  in  the
spectral ray with          an
                        astonishing precision.
   The solar rays and that             of
                                 sodium served        the starting-point for
                                                                   as
the measurements: the latter was introduced at the moment                ob                 of
servation; the others were observed the same day, some time before
sunset, with the same micrometer and spectrometer applied            Merz's           to
large refractor.    Great care was taken         fix each time the micro
                                                           to

                one     the strongest atmospheric rays,

                                                  the interval between the
observation      the terrestrial atmosphere and that
                   of                                           Jupiter the     of
instrument was left  untouched,  although      was  subsequently
                                                       it           observed
that this precaution was superfluous. The atmospheric rays were
determined      by
                observing the air near the horizon.         also sometimes I
made use      the moon, which was
              of                         little above the horizon; and
                                                 a
then   had the advantage
       I                       making one observation
                                      of                          the planet     on
and another        on
                  the moon, and then          returning
                                                      of     the planet,   to                      by
which the control was made more exact.
   The various bands are not equally easy          measure, for some are
                                                                to

the observations were somewhat multiplied. The following numbers
are the result          of    at
                       least three measurements.     Those taken    suc                                             in
cession usually agree better with each other than those taken on
different evenings; perhaps                               we
                                     have here the same phenomenon                                                           as
in the case of the double stars.

tion was very difficult, and deserved a careful examination. For this
purpose, during two successive evenings the slit was pointed on the
iine of maximum obscurity in the terrestrial atmospheric band, and
it was found to be in the exact prolongation of that of sodium.

     LXI.   Continuation of a Theory of the Dispersion of Light.
          By Professor CHALLIs, M.A., F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
       AVING      been much occupied with preparing for publication
  H        a volume of astronomical observations,       I  have been
 hindered from proceeding with the researches relating to the
 Dispersion of Light, which were commenced in a communication
 to the Number of the Philosophical Magazine for last June.
 On account of this interruption, it will be expedient, before
 advancing beyond the point to which the investigation was
 brought in that communication, to mention briefly the principal
 steps of the antecedent reasoning.        It was assumed that an
 aethereal wave within a   transparent  medium obeys the same laws
 as one without, but is propagated with less velocity in consequence
of being acted upon by an extraneous force always opposite in
 direction, and proportional in magnitude, to the accelerative
force due to the aether. The density of the aether was supposed to
 be the same within the medium as without, and the extraneous
retarding force was considered to be the mean effect of the re
 flexion of the motion of the aether from the atoms of the
medium, a vast number of atoms being supposed to be contained
in a portion of space the linear dimensions of which are ex
tremely small compared to the breadth (A) of a wave. The
amount of retardation depending not only on the number of
atoms in a given space and their arrangement, but also on their
mobility, it is necessary, in order to calculate the rate of pro
pagation in the medium, to determine the motion of an individual
atom as resulting both from the dynamical action of the waves
and the molecular forces of the medium. The form of the atom
being assumed to be spherical, the determination of the accelera
tion due to the waves was shown to depend on the solution of a
hydrodynamical problem of which this is the enunciation:—A
series of waves defined by the equations

is incident in the direction of the axis of a on a fixed smooth
sphere of given radius; it is required to find the condensation
at any point of the surface of the sphere at any instant. Accord
ingly the Article in the June Number consists almost exclusively
of investigations preparatory to the solution of this problem. In
the first place the solution was attempted by employing only the
two usual fundamental equations, and results were arrived at
which were subsequently shown to be incompatible with the given
 conditions of the problem.      The third general equation was
 then taken into account, and another process of solution, in
 volving the principle of the new equation, was then entered
 upon, but not brought to a conclusion.            propose now to                I
 resume the   argument,  taking  it up from the   point (in p. 458)
 at which the second process was commenced.
    It is unnecessary to repeat that part of the reasoning (ending
 in p. 461) by which the equation

 Now the condition of transparency of the medium requires that
 T', the relative velocity of the aether and the atom, should be
 proportional, or very nearly so, to the velocity of the aether; for
 in that case the mean retardation of the waves is produced by
 the atoms in motion nearly in the same manner as by the atoms
 fixed.   This condition is fulfilled if <U+017F>º be very nearly equal to 3.
 or  if Q be a  very large quantity, which is the case if 8 be very
 small. We are thus led to conclude that the term containing 8
 as a factor in the general value of W is insignificant when the
 problem is to determine the dynamical effect of the aethereal
 waves in producing vibrations of the atoms.         I have elsewhere
 shown (Phil. Mag. for November 1859, p. 332) that, in inquiring
 whether the waves have the effect of producing permanent
 motions of translation of the atoms, that term has to be taken
 into account.

   The applications of my hydrodynamical researches which            I
have made from time to time in the undulatory theory of light,
have now embraced most of the leading phenomena, excepting
that hitherto I have not indicated their application to the phe
nomena of Diffraction.         The theoretical explanations that have
been  given   of this class of facts rest mainly on an assumed law
of limited lateral divergence, and on this assumption have been
successful.     Now, from reasoning contained in this and previous
communications, I am justified in inferring that this law is a
consequence of the composite character of waves, and of the
circumstance that the component vibrations are partly direct
and partly transversal.        Also the supposition usually made in
the mathematical treatment of problems of diffraction, that the
waves are compounded of indefinitely small parts each possessing
the property of limited lateral divergence, is in accordance with
this hydrodynamical theory of the composition of waves.               I
have never been able to perceive how such a supposition is con
sistent with a theory of light which regards the aether as com
posed of discrete atoms.           On the whole the results of my re
searches give reasons for the conclusion that the undulatory
theory of light rests legitimately on no other than a hydro
dynamical basis.

    On the Crystalline Form of Malachite.         By Wiktor von Lang.

 -
       in the mineral collection of the British Museum, upon
several more tolerably well crystallized specimens of malachite, of
which the following is a description.          These new observations
not only confirmed my previous ones, but also led me, as              I
believe, to a somewhat more accurate determination of the cry
stallographic elements of malachite, viz.
                   a : b : c = 0.7823: 1 : 0.4036.
                         ac  = 90°   3'.

   The collection of the British Museum contains also specimens
from the now exhausted locality at Rheinbreitenbach.         But the
crystals from this locality, although the largest of all, are not
good for measurement, as they penetrate each other very much,
and are moreover coated with foreign matter.       They seem to be
combinations    of 1 1 0 and 1 2   3, the  prism    1 1 0 being not
much developed, as in fig. 3.

     crystal, a prism formed by the cleavage-planes” of the two twinned
     individuals and by an artificial plane in one zone with the two
     other planes.    This artificial plane formed in consequence two
     angles, the better one of them being 23° 26'. But for the mini
     mum deviation of the ordinary ray through this angle could                                                   I
     only get the approximate value 20° 34', having neither direct
     sunlight nor artificial light at my disposal—an essential condi

1.   prism is parallel to the mean axis of elasticity, one finds from

 the crystals are prismatic pyramids.      By means of a second sec
 tion perpendicular   to the axis c, it was found that the plane of
 the  optic axes is indeed    perpendicular  to the axis a, and that
 the character of the mean line (probably the first) coinciding with
 the axis c is negative.   The points of the axes themselves could
 not be  seen, as the angle  of the optic axes is too great for this;
 but another section, a little inclined to the former one, showed
 one axis, by which one could see that the negative angle of the
 optic axis is smaller for red than for blue light.
    The planes of the crystals are not very good for measuring,
 but the crystals are cleavable parallel to planes (101), and by
 means of such cleavage-planes                           I

     has hitherto been supposed that Herschelite crystallizes in
the hexagonal system; but the optical investigation of the nu
merous specimens in the mineralogical collection of the British

very considerable, it is then difficult to see the differences of the
intensity of the light in turning round the crystal. In conse
quence of these remarks, the prism-planes of the crystals of
Herschelite obtain the symbol 100; and the planes in the zone
 [100, 001], 0.01 being the top plane, become planes of ho
rizontal prisms parallel to the shorter diagonal of a prism 1 1 0,
on the planes of which the crystals are twinned. As none of the
planes are very good for measurement, the following crystallo
graphic data of Herschelite can only be considered as approxi
mations.
   The observed planes seem to correspond to the symbols
              100, 301, 502, 201,          1 0 1,  001.
Taking for the elements
                   a:  b : c-1 : 0.5774:0:8576,
we calculate for these planes the angles
                      3.01.100 = 2i 14
                      502. 1 00 = 25 0

   These crystals, like the foregoing, occur on a sort of lava;
they are often associated together in spherules, but are also found.
single, imbedded in the vesicular mass, from which they can
easily be got out.     Such crystals, very small but with tolerably
good planes, were combinations only of 301 and 001, with an

    The plane 101 seems also to occur on some of these crystals.
 The plane 001 on one of them showed re-entering angles,
 which, although not measurable, are also a proof of the twin
 structure.
    A very interesting specimen of Herschelite from Victoria,
 Australia, was lately given to the British Museum by Mr.
 Selwyn, the colonial geologist, who found it himself. The crys
 tals, occurring, like those just described, on basalt, are aggre
 gated together in a greater quantity; and although much larger
 than those from Italy, are still less                fit
                                           for good measurements, the
 planes being broken     every direction.

   The gradual augmentation of penetrative power as the tem
perature is augmented is here very manifest.        By raising the
spiral from a barely visible heat to an intense white heat, we
reduce the absorption, in the cases of bisulphide of carbon and
chloroform, to less than one-half.      At barely visible redness,
moreover, 56-6 and 54.8 per 100 get through sulphuric and
formic ether respectively; while, of the intensely white-hot spiral,
763 and 78.7 per 100 pass through the same vapours. By
augmenting the temperature of solid platinum, we introduce into
the radiation waves of shorter period, which, being in discord
with the periods of the vapours, get more easily through them.
   What becomes of the more slowly recurrent vibrations as the
more rapid ones are introduced 7 Do the latter take the place of
the former ? This question is answered by experiments made
with an opake solution of iodine, and with lampblack. As the
temperature of the platinum spiral increases from a dark heat to
the most intense white heat, the absolute quantity transmitted
through both these bodies steadily augments.       But this heat is
wholly obscure, for both the solution and the lampblack intercept
all the luminous heat.    Hence the conclusion that the augmen
tation   at of
           temperature   which introduces the shorter waves aug
ments     the same time the amplitude        the longer ones, and

hence also the inference that    body like the sun must

When the absorptions were calculated from these deflections,
the absorption of formic ether was found to be 6.3 per cent. in
advance of that of sulphuric.
   But in both Tables XVI. and XVII. we notice another case of
reversal.  In        all
                   the experiments with the platinum spiral
recorded       Table XV., chloroform showed itself less energetic
              in
 as   anabsorber than iodide     methyle; but
                                            of   Tables XVI. and         in
XVII. chloroform shows itself         decidedly the more powerful
                                                   to    be
of the two. Cases             of
                         this kind have,   my estimation, pecu   in                     a
liar significance, and therefore take care

                        the vapours were therefore repeated, with
the following results:—

decidedly the most opake of the two; the same result was obtained
with a spiral heated below redness, as proved by the following

 version: the experiments prove that there is a greater synchro
 mism between the vibrating periods of chloroform and lampblack
 than between those of chloroform and platinum raised to the
 temperature of the lampblack.  It will be seen, however, that as
the temperature of the platinum falls, the opacity of the chloro
form increases more quickly than that of the iodide: with an
intensely white-hot spiral; as shown in Table XXI., the absorp
tion of chloroform is to that of the iodide as 100: 162, while,
with the spiral heated to a temperature of 212°Fahr., the ratio
of the absorptions is as 100: 105.

   We have hitherto occupied ourselves with the radiation from
heated solids: I will now pass on to the examination of the
radiation from flames. The first experiments were made with a
steady jet of gas issuing from a small circular burner, the flame
being long and tapering. The top and bottom of the flame were
excluded, and             its
                   most brilliant portion was chosen   the source.              as

It  is therefore probable that the greater accord between the

less, but still very high. They follow in the next Table.

  Four months subsequent to the performance of the above ex
periments, a second series were made with olefiant gas, and the
following results obtained:—

   Beside the absorption by olefiant gas, I have placed that by
carbonic acid derived from Table XXXI. The superior power
of the acid is most decided in the smaller tensions; at a tension
of an inch it is twice that of the olefiant gas. The substances
approach each other more closely as the quantity of gas aug.
ments. . Here, in fact, both of them approach perfect opacity;
and as they draw near to this common limit, their absorptions,
                                                          -
as a matter of course, approximate.
   The temperature of a hydrogen-flame, as calculated by Bun
sen, is 325.9°C., while that of a carbonic-oxide flame is 3042°C.
The foregoing experiments demonstrate that accord subsists
between the oscillating periods of these sources and the periods
of aqueous vapour and carbonic acid at a temperature of 15° C.
The heat of the flame goes to augment the amplitude, and not
to quicken the vibration.
   Sent through carbonic oxide, the radiation from the carbonic
oxide flame gave the following absorptions:—

   The absorptive energy is here high—greater, indeed, than
that of olefiant gas; it falls considerably short, however, of that
exhibited by carbonic acid.     This result shows us that the main
radiant in the flame is             its
                              product     combustion, and not the

     Wishing to examine the radiation from a flame whose product
of combustion is sulphurous acid, through sulphurous                           acid,   I
resorted to the flame of bisulphide of carbon.                         Here, however,
we had carbonic acid mixed with the sulphurous acid of the flame.
Of the heat radiated by this composite source, the absorption
by an atmosphere of sulphurous acid amounted to
                         60 per cent.
The gas was sent from          generating retort through drying

period, the sulphuric ether is the more powerful absorber. For
the radiation from hot carbonic acid, the absorption of sulphuric
ether, as shown in Table XXXV., is between 6 and 7 per cent.
in excess of that of formic ether; while for the radiation from
hot aqueous vapour, the absorption by formic ether, as shown in
Table XXXVI., is 7 per cent. in excess of that by sulphuric.
That the periods of aqueous vapour, as compared with those of
carbonic acid, are slow, may therefore be inferred from these
experiments.
  The two following Tables illustrate the action of carbonic acid
gas and olefiant gas respectively, on the radiation from a flame
of hydrogen:—

    A            of the last two columns, one of which is trans
        comparison
ferred from Table XXXVII., proves the absorption of the rays
from a hydrogen-flame by olefiant gas to be about twice that of
carbonic acid; while, when the source was a carbonic-oxide flame,
the absorption by carbonic acid at small tensions was more than
twice that effected by olefiant gas.

  to a temperature of 325.9°C.; and inasmuch as the period of
 the water-molecules has been proved to be extra-red, the period
 of the vapour-molecules in the hydrogen-flame must be extra
 red also.
     Another point of considerable interest may here be adverted
 to. Professor Stokes has demonstrated that a change of period
 is possible to those rays which belong to the violet and extra
 violet end of the spectrum, the change showing itself by a
 degradation of the refrangibility.    That is to say, vibrations of a
"rapid period are absorbed, and the absorbing substance has
 become the source of vibrations of a longer period.         Efforts,                                       I
 believe, have been made to obtain an analogous result at the red
 end of the spectrum, but hitherto without result; and it has been
 considered improbable that a change of period can occur which
 should raise the refrangibility of the light or heat. Such a
 change, I believe, occurs when we plunge a platinum wire into a
 hydrogen-flame. The platinum is rendered white by the colli
 sion of molecules whose periods of oscillation are incompetent to
 excite vision.   There is in this common experiment an actual
 breaking up of the long periods into short ones—a true render
 ing of unvisual periods visual. The change of refrangibility
 differs from that of Professor Stokes, firstly, in      being      the            its               in
 opposite direction—that               is,   high;        secondly,

   Here the introduction of the platinum spiral changed the
periods of the flame into others more in discord with the periods
of the liquid-molecules, and hence the more copious transmission
when the spiral was employed.     It will be seen that a transmis
sion of 2  per cent. is here obtained through a layer of water
0.07 of an inch in thickness.

  I  have placed the results obtained with the hydrogen-flame in
the third column of figures. For some of the liquids it will be
observed that the absorption of the heat issuing from the small
gas-flame is nearly the same as that of the heat issuing from the
flame of hydrogen.       A very remarkable difference, however,
shows itself in the   deportment   of bisulphide of carbon as com
pared with that of chloroform.      For the small gas-flame chloro
form is the most     transparent  body  in the list; it is markedly
more   transparent  than the  bisulphide   of carbon, while for the
hydrogen-flame the bisulphide greatly excels the chloroform in
transparency. The large luminous gas-flame previously experi
mented with differs also from the small one here employed.
With the large flame, the absorption by the bisulphide is to that
by the chloroform as
                           100: 121,
while with the small flame the absorptions of the same two                                    sub
stances stand to each other in the ratio of
                                          100      :   76.
Numerous experiments were subsequently made, with a view of
testing this result, but in                  all
                               cases the bisulphide was found
more   opake than the chloroform     the radiation         to

tive power of the heat through the glass. Melloni, with two
plates of glass of different thicknesses, found the following trans
missions for the flame and the spiral:—
                  For   the flame.                 For      the platinum.
                        41-2                                 52.8
                         5:7                                 26-2
   The same remarks apply to the transparent selenite examined
by Melloni. This substance is highly opake to the extra-red
undulations; but the radiation from an alcohol flame is almost
wholly extra-red, and hence the opacity of the selenite to this
radiation. The introduction of the platinum spiral shortens the
periods and augments the transmission.    Thus, with two speci
mens of selenite, of different thicknesses, Melloni found the
transmission to be as follows:—
                    Flame.                              Platinum.
                        4'4          -                       19.5

So far the results of Melloni correspond with those of M. Knob
lauch; but the Italian philosopher pursues the matter further,
and shows that M. Knoblauch's results, though true for the par
ticular substances examined by him, are far from being appli
cable to diathermic media generally.       Melloni shows that in
the case of black glass and black mica, a striking inversion of
the effect is observed ; that is to say, that through these sub
stances the radiation from the flame is more copiously trans
mitted than the radiation from the platinum spiral.      For two
pieces of black glass of different thicknesses, he found the fol
lowing transmissions:—
               From the flame.                    From the platinum.
                        52-6                                 42-8
                        29-9                                 27.1
And for two plates of black mica the following transmissions
were   found:—
               From the flame.                     From the platinum.
                        62-8                                 52-5
                        43.3                                 28.9
These results were left unexplained by Melloni; but the solution
is now easy. The black glass and the black mica owe their
blackness to the carbon incorporated in them, and the blackness
                                                                                    it its
of this substance, as already remarked, proves the accord of
vibrating-periods with those      the visible spectrum. But
has been proved that carbon               in of
                                    considerable degree pervious
                                         is   a
to the waves of long period—that       say,    such waves
                                                  is   to    are to            as

emitted by a flame of alcohol. The case of the carbon is there
fore precisely antithetical to that of the transparent glass—the
former transmitting the heat of long period most freely, and the
latter transmitting the heat of short period most freely. Hence
it follows that the introduction of the platinum wire, by convert
ing the long periods of the flame into short ones, augments the
transmission through the transparent glass and selenite, and
diminishes it through the black glass and the black mica.
 §   XIII.    Radiation of hydrogen-flame through lampblack, iodine,

salt, with the following results:—
   For the heat of a hydrogen-flame, the transmission through a
perfectly transparent plate of rock-salt was
                                    82.3 per cent.
For a spiral of platinum wire heated to whiteness by an electric
current, the transmission was
                                     87 per cent.
For the same spiral lowered to bright redness, the transmission
Was
                                    84.4 per cent.
For the same spiral lowered to moderate                   redness, the   transmis
sion was
                                    83.6 per cent.
   Nothing was changed in these experiments but the heat of the
spiral; the direction of the rays, and the size of the radiating
body, remained throughout the same; still we find a gradually
augmenting opacity on the part of the rock-salt as the tempera
ture of the source is lowered.    There cannot, I think, be a
doubt that MM. De la   Provostaye  and Desains are right in their
conclusion that rock-salt acts differently on different calorific
rays, and is not, as Melloni supposed, equally transparent to all.
For the heat of the hydrogen-flame it is more opake than                           for
that    the moderately red spiral.

                                             that which the first         of                                   or
superficial stratum imparted       the aether.    The aether must
                                                          to
retard and indeed squander the internal molecular motion; and
were the medium absent—were the cushion removed which
interferes with the direct propagation       motion from molecule         of
to  molecule—conduction would          freer than      present; the
                                                               be                        at
heat would penetrate further into the mass than when the aether
intervenes.
   The reasoning just employed leads          the inference that thoseto
molecules which    experience  most resistance from the aether must
byto be
    the least competent                         to
                              transfer the motion         heat from one                  of
   the other.    The direct power        communication         of

    the aether, and the motion obtained        indirectly  cannot make
good the loss.    We are thus led                              to
                                        the conclusion that the best
radiators ought      prove themselves the worst conductors.
                                to
     Abroad consideration       the subject shows that the conclu

sion       general

mechanism leads us. There is but one serious exception known
to me to the law here indicated; this is copper, which MM. De
la Provostaye and Desaims place higher than gold as a radiator,
though it is also higher as a conductor. When, however, the
immense change in radiative power which the slightest film of
 oxide can produce, and the liability of heated copper to con
tract such a film, are taken into account, the apparent exception
 will not have too much weight ascribed to                  have had                it.   I                   a

 gold; and,                 all   its
                       faces, that coated with copper has the least
                       of
 emissive power.    This     probably due    is some slight impurity      to

manufacture by reactions        between       the elements    of the com
pound.
    General von Lenk does not deny the reactions which may cause
the inflammation of the gun-cotton when they disengage a suf
ficient heat; but he thinks they may be avoided by taking the
precautions which he has recently
                                    made known.
    His method depends on the same reactions as those used in
the powder works at Bouchet seventeen years ago, and which
are described in a memoir of the 17th of February 1849. The
Austrian, like the French gun-cotton, is a compound pro
duced by the immersion of cotton in a mixture of nitric and
sulphuric acids. Their proportions may be varied within toler
 ably wide limits without modifying the quality of the product.
 Yet as the most successful the author of the memoir of 1849
 mentions a mixture of 3 volumes of nitric acid with 7 of sul
 phuric acid, equal in weight to 1 of nitric to 2.86 of sulphuric
 acid. This is almost the ratio of 1 to 3 adopted by General von
 Lenk. At Hirtenberg each acid is admitted into the mixing
 vessel by a small orifice, in order to moderate the increase of
 temperature.      At Bouchet, where this precaution was not taken,
 an increase of about 20° was observed; but the mixture was pre
pared sufficiently long beforehand to allow it to sink to the
temperature of the surrounding air before the immersion of the
cotton.
   Moreover differences of this kind could have no influence on
the qualities of gun-cotton.         We shall describe those to which
General von Lenk attaches most importance. According to
him, the Bouchet method, in which 200 grammes of cotton are
immersed in a litre of the mixture, would not give the same pro
duct as that obtained by working with a much larger propor
tion of the mixture and by means of a special apparatus. This
apparatus is a rectangular trough, divided longitudinally into
three compartments, and kept at the temperature of a current
of water which circulates between double sides. The first is a
reservoir which supplies the second with the mixture, so as to
have constantly a bath of 30 kilogs. for 100 grammes of cotton.
The cotton is thus immersed in 300 times                its
                                                       weight     ofacids.
It   isstirred, and   as  soon as   itappears completely soaked with
acid, which only requires about minute,
                                     a           it   placed
                                                      is          on
                                                                   asmall
strainer over the bath and subjected          to
                                              a  regulated pressure,   so
as  always to   leave the same weight     of acids. With      little skill
                                                              a
1:150    kilog. is  obtained   as   the weight     of
                                                    the pressed mass;
hence 100 grammes       of   cotton take 1-050 kilog. from the bath.
These   operations    are  constantly   repeated   onthe same bath,    re
placing each time    by          kilog.  of
                          1-050            the new mixture that which
the cotton has removed.                                         -

          be
chemical composition.
   We shall not discuss the other differences between the me
thod      of
          Bouchet and that         Hirtenberg.    The most certain
                                                       of

                      of preparing and employing Gun-cotton.               539
means   of ascertaining the influence which they may exert is to
compare their respective products. This we have done within the
last three months, with the cooperation of M. Faucher, Assistant
Commissioner of Gunpowder, and of M. Chapoteaut, assistant to
one    of us.
   Before describing our comparative experiments, we must men
tion a last modification which General von Lenk has introduced
into the manufacture of Austrian gun-cotton.
   It is regarding the use of soluble glass, with a view to close
the fibres of cotton by the precipitation of silicate to retard the
disengagement of gas, and then to eliminate the traces of acid
which might be there. (The words in italics are extracted from a
note of General von Lenk.)
   This preparation is applied by arranging the gun-cotton in a
rotatory apparatus, into which leads a pipe pouring upon it solu
tion of glass of 12° Baumé. The gun-cotton thus treated is
dried and left for a sufficiently long time to allow the carbonic
acid of the atmosphere to unite with the soda of the glass, which
causes the precipitation of silica. The carbonate of soda being
removed by washing, the insoluble silicate remains as a sort of
sheath, adhering to the fibres of the cotton, which thus increases
about 2 per cent. in weight.
   Here is a difference between the two methods; soluble glass
has never been used in France; but we shall show in describing
our experiments that this modification has not the importance
ascribed to it by General von Lenk.
  Our experiments have been made upon three series of pyro
xyles.
  In  the first we class the large number of specimens which
have been prepared and examined in the laboratory, principally
with a view to determine the quantity of pyroxyle produced by
a given weight of cotton, by varying the quantity of the mixture,
its proportion, and the duration     the impregnation.

  We may observe that this third specimen was immersed                     in

Bouchet method: one kept from the old manufacture of 1847,
and two others made recently.    For one of these latter the Lenk
mixture was used (1 of nitric to 3 of sulphuric acid), and                                                   for

in which 3 equivalents of water are replaced by 3 equivalents of
nitric acid, so that General von Lenk's gun-cotton would be a
trinitrocellulose.  This is the name by which they have de
scribed it.
  They have further expressed the opinion that the pyroxyle
prepared  with less proportions of acids, as at Bouchet, might
present a different composition.
   One of us had determined in 1847 the composition of gun
cotton, and had represented it by the formula
                                       C24 H17           O175NO3.
We had therefore first to determine whether the product then
investigated was different from that of Lenk's gun-cotton, and
in case the Bouchet cotton proved chemically identical with the
Lenk cotton, what ought to be       true formula.            its

     General von Lenk attributes the bad results obtained                                            in
France         by
             the Commission      1846,           of
                                           the circumstance that to
sufficient attention had not been bestowed     the preparation             on                            of
the gun-cotton, and that    definite and adequately nitrated com
                                            a
pound had not been taken. He therefore works under condi

                           of preparing and employing Gun-cotton.                                          545
tions which he considers favourable to nitration, and thinks he
has obtained a gun-cotton which offers great resistance to de
composition.
  We shall not discuss the theoretical value of this assertion,
but it seems inadmissible. It                               is,
                                    the contrary, probable that   on
a gun-cotton would decompose the more easily the further                                                        it
varied from the type cellulose, and therefore the more nitrated.

  the lapse of some days the flask was seen to fill with thick red
  vapours; and the same pulverulent, non-nitrogenized residue of
  which we have spoken was obtained. No ignition was observed
 in these latter experiments.
    We may also mention a decomposition which one of us ob
 served when about a gramme of gun-cotton was placed in a Gay
 Lussac’s hot-air bath containing oil, the temperature of which
 was only 47°.  The gun-cotton thus decomposed came from a
 specimen prepared by an immersion of forty-eight hours, and
 soaked by the Lenk method.   The detonation, which was very
 brisk, was exhibited immediately after the gun-cotton had been
 placed in contact with the metal.
    This fact recalls another, quoted in an Austrian report—the
 explosion of a specimen at a temperature of 69°. General
 von Lenk attributed this explosion to sulphuric and perhaps
 nitric acid remaining in the gun-cotton. Yet our explosion,
 observed at a lower temperature, was not caused by the presence
 of these acids.
   We dwell upon this detonation at 47°, because this heat may
 be attained and even exceeded by the action of the solar rays.
        In
       fact at the Bouchet powder-mills, that              country        is,   in   a
 with     mean climate,
             a              temperature     69° was observed       of                          in

                                        drying-cloths.        on
   The   preceding  experiments show  incontestably that, contrary
 toGeneral von Lenk's assertion, his gun-cotton resists the action
of heat no better than the Bouchet. In all these cases the sili
cated Austrian gun-cotton behaved     the same manner       ours.

   With these facts,   decomposition produced

                 of preparing         and employing Gun-cotton.                 547
   Without detailing the known cases of decomposition of gun
cotton at the temperature of the places in which it was preserved,
we shall limit ourselves to speaking of decompositions which we
have observed in specimens of the manufacture of 1847, which
had been washed with special care, either with pure or with
alkaline water.
   Of twenty-eight specimens less than a few grammes in weight
placed in a small stoppered bottle, sixteen had undergone various
alterations,
  We took at random one of the altered specimens for ex
amination. This specimen consisted originally of 6 grammes of
gun-cotton which had been washed with potash and left from
the 17th of March 1850 (14 years) in a stoppered bottle imper
fectly closed.  It had left a residue of 79 per cent., of a deep
yellow colour, strongly acid, but without sulphuric acid. This
residue dissolved completely in water, and, like grape-sugar, re
duced potassio-tartrate of copper.   Its boiling solution emitted
a fresh acetous odour, and, remarkably enough, it disengaged
ammonia under the action of potass.
  Hence, under ordinary atmospheric conditions, there are                        in
dubitable instances of spontaneous alterations of gun-cotton,
and what is more, of a gun-cotton washed with alkaline water.
                                                                                      e
  But we have seen that, when warm, gun-cotton decomposes in
four different ways, that in certain cases it detonates, and that
in others, apparently identical, it is destroyed without inflamma
tion. Why should it not be so with gun-cotton kept at low
temperatures 7     Why in the case of simple decomposition at
ordinary temperatures may not cases of detonation also occur :
The analogy is too evident to oblige us to resort to the supposi
tion of bad washings to explain the explosions of gun-cotton.
    We admit that a badly washed gun-cotton is more exposed to
decomposition than a well-prepared gun-cotton.        But seeing the
facility with which             all
                            specimens      gun-cotton, of    whatever   of

   Twenty-five shots were fired with the Lenk cotton, fifteen
with the Bouchet cottons, with      charge     grammes, and with

   From these results we think we may conclude that both the
Lenk and the Bouchet gun-cottons have the same ballistic force.
   For these experiments the charge of gun-cotton occupied a
length of 5 centimetres in the barrel. It was proposed to try
it  again by ramming it more strongly, and thus reducing the
length to 3 centimetres; but on the first round with this form
of charge, and with 3 grammes of gun-cotton made at Paris
by General von Lenk's method, the cannon burst.
    This fact is analogous to that which has several times been
observed in firing the Bouchet gun-cotton.                 We find in it a
proof of the resemblance of the Austrian and the French gun
cottons, as regards their bursting effects.

spontaneous explosion, which, we think, rules the entire question.

     In spite of the differences existing
neral von Lenk and that followed for seven years at the Bouchet
powder-works, the same gun-cotton is obtained in both cases,
except as regards 2 per cent. of a silicate, which is found in the
gun-cotton taken as a type of the Hirtenberg manufacture.
   This silicate was not met with in the gun-cotton proceeding
from an English manufacture established on the pattern of the
Hirtenberg one.     In none of our experiments did it exert any
appreciable influence on the properties of gun-cotton;    addition                    its
appeared therefore useless.
  Neglecting this inert substance,                   all
                                           the gun-cottons we ana

   The bursting property which led                         the rejection              gun-cotton

   This property may in any case be diminished by using special
cartridges, consisting of paper cylinders covered with woven
gun-cotton; but in experiments made in Austria with twelve
pounders, a less initial velocity was reached than was desired
in France.
   Moreover an opinion opposed to the use of gun-cotton pre
vails now in Austria; for the special form of artillery which had
been created for                         its
                     employment has been there given up.

added to the battery to make the intermittent current transmitted
by the commutator equal to the primitive continuous current i.
  An element a, without resistance, capable of producing in the
voltameter the same current i as that of the battery P, would
give, in the sine-compass with long wire B, a current of the inten
sity  e-f  (for the demonstration see the complete memoir). The

the oxyhydrogen-flame, was produced by a change in the period
of vibration. By a different mode of reasoning I arrived at the
same conclusion myself, and published the conclusion subse
quently.” The reference appended to the last sentence is to “Phil.
Trans. vol. cliv. p. 327.” The following passage is taken from a
paper read before the Royal Society by Prof. Tyndall on March
17, 1864, and will be found in the place indicated, at p. 360:—
   “Professor Stokes has demonstrated that a change of period is
possible to those rays which belong to the violet and extra-violet end
of the spectrum, the change showing itself by a degradation of the
refrangibility. That is to say, vibrations of a rapid period are ab
sorbed, and the absorbing substance has become the source of vibra
tions of a longer period.        Efforts, I believe, have been made to
obtain an   analogous   result at the red end of the spectrum, but hitherto
without   result;   and it has been considered improbable that a change
of period can occur which should raise the refrangibility of the light
or heat.    Such a change, I believe, occurs when we plunge a plati
num wire into a hydrogen-flame.           The platinum is rendered white
by the collision of molecules whose periods of oscillation are incom
petent to excite vision.       There is in this common experiment an
actual breaking up of the long periods into short ones—a true ren
dering of unvisual periods visual.         The change of refrangibility dif
fers from that of Professor Stokes, firstly, in            being         its
                                                                     the oppo              in

from the corresponding parts of my own reasonings, in the same
sense as two separate links of a chain are different from the same
links when held together by a third, connecting link. Prof.
Tyndall states that the platinum is rendered “white” by oscil
lations which are invisible; and he hence concludes at once
that there is a “breaking up of long periods into short ones.”
This, however, is simply a non-sequitur.                  founded my own              I
 conclusions concerning the origin of lime-light, &c., upon the
evident deficiency of the oxyhydrogen-flame in Newtonic or
 luminous rays, and upon                       its

giving the outlines of a discourse delivered by me at Cambridge
on the subject of “Calcescence.”              In that article only one of
the three experiments suggested by me was mentioned; and the
explanation of lime-light, also, was not explicitly referred to ;
but, on the other hand, it was stated that the matter had been
more fully treated in papers read at the Meeting of the British
Association at Newcastle.          Surely any one, like Prof. Tyndall,
feeling an interest in the subject, after reading the above
mentioned article (and which is actually adverted to, though
not distinctly, in the passage quoted before from the Philo
sophical Transactions), ought to have referred, under such cir
cumstances,      to the ‘Athenaeum ” for 1863, to see whether
there were to be found in it further particulars concerning this
subject. Perhaps, the ‘Reader’ having become more extensively
known by that time, the abstract published in                     columns                  its                  on
Sept. 26, 1863, would have likewise fallen then into Professor

 difficult to decide which habit is of more importance—to study the

 venting the necessity of such explanations as those preceding,

 defence             of right*.
    5. Prof. Tyndall states (Phil. Mag. S. 4. vol. xxviii. p.338):-
 “The rendering of metals incandescent by obscure rays has not
 yet been accomplished. This is a question on which Dr. Akin
 has been engaged for some years, and it is not my intention to
 publish anything relating to it until the very promising arrange
 ments which he has devised have had a sufficient trial”f. Regard
 ing this statement,                       I
                        think it useful to publish the substance of
 a letter lately addressed by me to the President of the British
    * Merely as an illustration of what has been stated above regarding   -
                                                                                   for
 getfulness, I shall mention the following instance.
    In the paper commented on in this Note, Prof. Tyndall says, amongst
 other things (p. 332):-‘‘ In solid metals augmented temperature intro
 duces waves of shorter periods into the radiation.                 It may be asked,
 ‘What becomes of the long obscure periods when we heighten the tem
 perature? Are they broken up or changed into shorter ones, or do they
 maintain themselves side by side with the new vibrations?” The question
 is worth an experimental answer.”          Now that question had been practically
 answered    by  Prof.  Draper,  as long  ago  as 1847.    He said (Phil. Mag. S. 3.
vol. xxx. p. 350:—“It is to be remarked that, while the more refrangible
 end [of the spectrum] undergoes a great expansion, the other extremity
 exhibits a corresponding though a less change . . . . arising from the                                             in
 creased brilliancy of the light . . . [as the temperature rises].”         No doubt,
 Prof. Tyndall has read the paper from which these latter passages are
taken, and which has generally been considered (and more especially so by
 Melloni) as of great importance. But Prof. Tyndall has evidently forgotten
the fact, or else he would certainly have mentioned               and yet    would
                                                                                        it;             it           be

received a letter from the Assistant General Secretary of the
British Association, in which my attention was requested to a
Resolution, which was adopted by the General Committee at the
last Meeting of the Association, and to the effect, ‘That Prof.
Griffith and Dr. Akin be requested to continue their Report
on the Transmutation of Spectral Rays.”         In answer to this
communication, I now beg leave to state that, after the expe
rience of the last two years, and more especially of last summer,
I  feel it would be a hopeless undertaking for me to continue,
at Oxford, the experiments begun there.        Moreover,    am not                            I
sure   whether,  after the end of the present year,   shall be able                       I
to give my attention any longer to scientific researches.”   Thus,
as far as I am concerned, the trial of the “arrangements devised
by” me, and of the apparatus constructed for the experiments
begun at Oxford, is at an end.      Such being the case,   have no                            I
doubt that, with the means at his command and his experimental
proficiency, Prof. Tyndall will now realize and “publish ’’ a dis
covery which              I
                   have assigned the methods for accomplishing,
and which I should have probably effected myself, I may say,
years ago, had                I
                    been seconded as I had hoped, either by per
sons or   by circumstances.    Astronomers have placed the merit
of the mathematicians     who first conjectured the existence of
Neptune above that of the practical observers who actually dis
covered that planet. In my own case,      have made considerable    I
sacrifices of time, and even of feeling, in order to prove by ex
periment what I had deduced originally from logical reasonings.
Being now practically shut out from pursuing the subject any
further, I shall leave it for physicists to decide whatever merit
may belong to the originator of the research, as compared with
the merit of him, whoever it may be, who, more fortunate, shall
bring the research to a satisfactory close+.

  new Species of Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene Corals.”           By P.
  Martin Duncan, M.B., Sec. G.S., and G. P. Wall, Esq., F.G.S.
      The authors first referred to the Miocene age of the Corals that
  have hitherto been described from the West Indies, and then stated
  that in this paper conclusive evidence was brought forward, for the
  first time, of the existence of an Eocene formation in Jamaica.
  They next noticed successively the lithological characters of the
  different members of the Jamaican fossiliferous rocks, and then de
  scribed two new species of Corals from the Lower Cretaceous beds,
  and six from the Miocene, besides giving notices of additional
  known forms from all the strata; and the conclusion was drawn,
  that the facies of these Cretaceous Corals was suggestive of a close
  alliance having existed between this fauna and that of Gosau in the
  Eastern Alps.    The question of the existence of Lower Cretaceous
  strata in other West Indian islands having been discussed, attention
  was drawn to the character of the Eocene Corals, as being con
 firmatory of Mr. Barrett's views on the existence of that formation
 in the island, and the paper was concluded by some additional re
  marks on the Miocene beds, and their probable correlation with
 those of Trinidad, Antigua, &c.
     2. “On the Correlation of the Irish Cretaceous Strata.”          By
 Ralph Tate, Esq., F.G.S.
     The non-existence in Ireland of the formations between the
 Lower Lias and the Upper Greensand having been stated, Mr.
 Tate first showed that the Cretaceous formations occurring near
 Belfast are referable to the so-called Upper Greensand (Hibernian
 Greensand of the author) and to the Upper Chalk, the latter con
 sisting chiefly of a “White Limestone " with flints, and containing
 species known to occur in the Upper Chalk of Norwich and Meudon,
 with others allied to Maestricht forms. The basement-beds, form
 ing lithologically a passage to the Hibernian Greensand, are (1)
 chloritic limestone with Sponge-remains belonging to about thirty
 species, and (2) a calcareo-chloritic sandstone with three species of
 Echinoderms, the dominant form being Ananchytes gibba. These
 passage-beds are only locally developed, and when they are absent
the junction of the Greensand and the White Limestone is very
abrupt.     The Hibernian Greensand was considered by Mr. Tate to
represent the Upper Greensand, the Chalk-marl, and the lower part
of the Lower Chalk of England, and to be the miniature counter
part of D’Orbigny’s Etage Cenomanien. It nowhere exceeds 55 feet
in thickness; but it nevertheless contains the following beds:—
(1) Chloritic sands and sandstones of Colin Glen, or the Zone of
Earogyra columba ; (2) Chloritic sandstones of Woodburn, or the
Zone of Inoceramus Crispi ?; (3) Yellow-sandstones and Marls with
Chert, or the Zone of Ostrea carinata; and (4) Glauconitic sands,
or the Zone of Exogyra conica.

VERIFICATION OF THE "LAW OF ELECTROLYSIS WHEN EXTERNAL
    WORK IS PERFORMED BY THE GALVANIC CURRENT.                        BY M. J.
    L. SORET.
       order to explain,     conformably with the mechanical theory of
INheat,   the production    by an electric current of effects external to the
circuit which it traverses, such, for instance, as the performance of
mechanical work or the generation of induced currents, recourse has
been had to an hypothesis proposed by Helmholtz, Scoresby and Joule,
Clausius, and other physicists.          According to this hypothesis, the
law of    electrolytic  action is   regarded  as still holding good for this
special case.     In order to    supplement   previous investigations, I un
dertook the verification of this point by comparing the amount of
chemical action with the mean intensities of currents, usually dis
continuous, by which external work was performed.
    In order to produce powerful external effects, I have employed for
the most part a Ruhmkorff's coil, but I found it needful in most
cases to substitute a contact-breaker formed of a toothed wheel and
platinum spring for the ordinary contact-breaker of this apparatus.
By this means I obtained a much more rapid succession of currents,
and at the same time greater stability in the needle of the sine-com
pass by which the mean intensity of the current was measured.
     After a great number of experiments performed for the purpose of
assuring myself of the exactitude of the method           I was employing, I
arrived at the   following    results,  which confirm the law of electrolysis
 for these conditions.
    In a circuit of great resistance, containing a Daniell's battery, the
sine-compass, a voltameter charged with sulphate of copper, and the
inducing coil of the Ruhmkorff's apparatus, the weight of copper
deposited in the voltameter was found to be always proportional to
the mean intensity of the current, whether the current was conti
 nuous (that is to say, when the contact-breaker of the Ruhmkorff's
 apparatus was excluded from the circuit, in which case no external
 action took place) or whether it was discontinuous (that is to say,
 when the contact-breaker was put in action, in which case an ex
 ternal action was set up, though this was certainly of small import
 ance relatively to the total work performed by the current).
    A similar result was obtained with a circuit of small resistance,
 consisting only of the Ruhmkorff's apparatus, the compass, and a
 single Daniell's cell in which a plate of platinum was substituted for
 the copper. The chemical action was measured by the quantity of
 copper deposited upon the platinum plate.            With this disposition of
 the   apparatus,   the  proportion    of external work when the contact
 breaker was put in action was considerable.                              -   -
     Under the same     conditions,    the quantity  of electro-positive metal
  (cadmium) which is dissolved in the battery is also proportional to
  the intensity of the current.         This determination cannot be made
  with as much accuracy as that of the weight of copper deposited, but
  the mean result of the experiments agrees with the law of electro
  lysis, Comptes Rendus, vol. lix. p. 485 (September 12, 1864).
