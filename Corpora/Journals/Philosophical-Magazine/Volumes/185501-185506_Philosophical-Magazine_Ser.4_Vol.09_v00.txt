 I.   On a Method of increasing certain Effects of Induced               Elec
              tricity. By W. R. GRove, Esq.”
    the course of last year I observed that, by connecting the
IN coatings of a Leyden phial with the extremities of the secon
dary coil of Ruhmkorff’s apparatus, a great increase in the bril
liancy of the discharge could be obtained. Circumstances diverted
                                                     I
my attention from it at the time, and did not publish the expe
riment, though       I
                     believe Mr. Gassiot mentioned it in one of his
papers.     Ihave since heard that M. Sinsteden in France had
made the same observation, though                    I
                                             do not know when, nor
whether he has     published  his experiments.              -
                           I
   The point which now think may be worth insertion in the
Philosophical Magazine, is the conversion, by means of a Ruhm
korff coil, of an indefinite amount of voltaic power into static
electricity.   If a small Leyden phial have coatings connected
                                                            its
respectively    with the extremities            of
                                            the secondary wire              of   a
Ruhmkorff coil (the      primary    being,     usual, connected with
                                                     as
the condenser       M.

terminals and brought within striking distance), the noise and
brilliancy  of the discharges are greatly increased, with generally              a
slight, but     avery slight, diminution        their length.
                                                      in             nowIf
the voltaic battery       increased, the coil and Leyden phial re
                         be
maining the same, but little increase         the length

2            Mr. W. R. Grove     on a   Method      of increasing
four cells of 2 inches by 4 of the nitric acid battery be used,
and a pint Leyden phial, but little increase of effect will be
obtained by using eight or more cells, and the platinum at the
contact breaker would be rapidly destroyed by the sparks.
    But substitute for the pint Leyden phial one of double the
capacity, and it will be found, that though this second phial was
inferior to the first with a battery of four cells (giving shorter
sparks, and fewer in a given time, though somewhat denser),
yet it is far superior to the first with the battery of eight cells,
and the sparks at the contact breaker are no longer injurious.
    By adding more coated surface, for instance, another phial,
four more cells may be added, and increased effects will be ob
tained, and thus with the same coil the brilliancy of the discharge
may be increased to an extent to which I have not yet found a
limit.   I  obtained this result some months back; but not having
a  large  battery,  I did not go beyond ten cells, which found             I
would well bear a jar of one square foot coated surface.
    By the aid of Mr. Gassiot’s more powerful apparatus, I have,
with him, used thirty cells of the nitric acid battery, 2 inches
by 4, and five square feet of coated surface; the effects were very
striking, a roar of voluminous discharge of 0:6 of an inch long,
increased to 1.5 inch when the flame of a spirit-lamp was placed
between the terminals.      I have never witnessed such a torrent
of electrical discharges; the noise could not be borne long with
out great discomfort.
   With the same voltaic battery, and an additional square foot
of coated surface, the effect was somewhat diminished. Mr. Gas
siot had not more than thirty cells available at the time of our
experiments, so that   I  have not yet ascertained the limit to which
this increase of power can be carried.          I
                                             presume, however, there
is a limit,  for reasons which will be  presently  apparent.
   The   following   precautions are essential to the success of the
experiment:—
   1st. The wire proceeding from the outer extremity of the
                                                                 j,
secondary coil must be connected with the inside or insulated
coating of the Leyden battery, if the battery is not wholly insu
lated.    The reason of this    is,
                                that the outer extremity     the coil of
   the better insulated portion, and also that            electricity
                                                            to
of is
    tension flies off;
                     a   good spark can, under ordinary circum
stances,  be  obtained from the outer, but scarcely any from the
inner terminal of the coil.
   2nd. The distance between the hammer                of
                                                the contact breaker
and the soft iron core should         be       great    practicable,
                                                                 as
                                                of an as
                                     made
at least one-eighth  of     inch; this
                           an              isimportant point                   as   to
the theory and experimental results           the Ruhmkorff coil.
Time,   as   is well known,      necessary for the development
                                is                                                  of

                       certain Effects            of   Induced Electricity.                                    8
electro-magnetism; and M. Matteucci, in his recent valuable
book on induced electricity, has shown some remarkable results
flowing from this fact.    If the hammer be too near the core,
the former is raised before the latter has time to be fully mag
netized; and when a Leyden condenser is used, further time is
required for this to be charged.   This demand of time indicates
the probable limit to the increase of power to which have above                              I
alluded.
   It is very curious to see the absorption, so to speak, of voltaic
power by the Leyden battery: when the maximum effect for a
given Leyden jar has been passed, the contact breaker shows by
its sparks the unabsorbed induced electricity which now appears                                                in
the primary wire;       additional jar acts
                                     an          safety-valve    the      as   a                          to
contact breaker and utilizes the voltaic power, and              on.                         so
   It   is  question
             a           some interest why jar charged
                                 of                                the ordi
                                                                      a                        in
nary way          by
                temporary contact          the terminals   of    secondary               of  a
coil will only receive     very slight charge, and give
                                     a                         discharge                 a                     of
scarcely measurable length, yet when permanently connected with
the terminals, will give long and powerful discharge. The follow
                                          a
ing     the best theory can offer.

surement of the rapidity of succession may be made in the fol
lowing way.     Move across the line of discharge with a steady
hand a  strip of writing-paper, it will be punctured with a row of
holes, which will be the more closely approximated in proportion
as the succession of discharges is more rapid.   By a disc of paper
attached to an axis moving with a given rate of revolution, this
measurement may be made very accurate and useful.
   Those who possess the coil apparatus will find it very conve
nient to have a plate of glass, coated on each side with tinfoil,
placed on the base of the machine, and having strips leading
from each coating to binding-screws, with which the terminals
of the secondary coil can be corrected at will.

Physiºlº     in general admit that vapours behave in the
  same manner in gases as in vacuo, with this difference only,
that in gases the equilibrium of tension is slowly established,
whilst in vacuo it is produced almost instantaneously. An ap
paratus invented by Gay-Lussac is usually employed in lectures
on physics, to show that the elastic force of vapours is exactly
the same in gases as in vacuo. Nevertheless there is no record
of any exact experiments having been made for the establish
ment of this law, which is of great importance, especially in
meteorology.                                        -

6       M.    W. Regnault on the Elastic Forces            of Vapours
    I havedetailed (at page 134 of my memoir) * the experiments
which   Imade in order to determine directly the elastic force of
aqueous vapour at saturation in air and nitrogen gas at different
temperatures.     The ninety-one determinations which         made      I
between 0° and 40°C.     gave, without exception, the elastic force
of aqueous vapour as weaker in the air than in vacuo. The dif
ferences are of the same kind as those previously found between
the weight of water which saturates a given volume of air, and
the weight deduced from calculation.       Nevertheless, in these
experiments    I
               endeavoured to vary the circumstances as far as
possible, and especially to realize those conditions in which it
might be expected that saturation would be obtained.
   Aqueous vapour having but a feeble tension at low tempera
tures, it became important to extend these experiments to more
volatile fluids.   I accordingly made use of aether, sulphuret of
carbon, and benzine. The apparatus employed was that described
in the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 3 sér. vol. xv. p. 131t.
Into a balloon, of the capacity of 600 to 700 cubic centims,
a small hermetically-closed capsule was introduced, containing
the liquid to be operated upon. This balloon, to the neck of
which a tube of considerable diameter had been previously
attached, communicated       with a mercurial manometer.         The
entire apparatus was placed in a large tub filled with water,
which was kept at a constant temperature.       A piece of glass was
let into one  part  of the side of the tub, through   which the ma
nometer might be observed.       The apparatus being arranged, a
vacuum was repeatedly produced in the balloon, the air admitted
after each exhaustion being perfectly dry.     Lastly, the apparatus
was hermetically sealed, containing air under the pressure of the
atmosphere.
   The elastic force acquired by this dry air, kept constantly at
the same volume, at different temperatures, having been deter
mined, the capsule was ruptured by the action of heat, and the
series of observations was recommenced on the air saturated with
vapour. The liquid enclosed in the capsule had previously been
kept from contact with the air, in order that it should not have
a tendency to absorb the air of the balloon.     The volume of the
capsule in proportion to that of the balloon may also be varied
in different experiments, so as to make sure that the absorption
or disengagement of       air   by
                              the liquid has not caused any sensible
perturbation.    The  following are some        of
                                             the results that have  I

   These tables, in which      I have only inserted the greatest ten
sions observed at   given   temperatures,    show that the elastic force
of vapour of aether in the air is constantly less than that obtained
in vacuo; the difference becomes greater in the same proportion
as the elastic forces themselves.
   Fearing that in the preceding experiments the tube by which
a communication was established between the balloon and the
manometer might be too small to allow of the necessary diffusion
of the vapour, I replaced it by one of the same diameter as
the manometric tube itself, that is to say, 22 millims.                 Under
these conditions the    following    series of   experiments     was made.
A small quantity of the liquid was always distilled over into the
manometric tube before the commencement of the observations.

    It   will be observed that this series presents still greater differ
ences than the preceding, but this arises from the maximum
determinations only having been inserted.      The observations at
the same   temperature  were made at intervals of half an hour.
   It would take up too much time to indicate here the different
circumstances under which the partial determinations for these
three series were effected,—these circumstances exercise a great
influence upon the values found for the elastic force of the vapour.
I  shall content myself with saying, that very often a determina
 tion was not made until after the bath had been kept for several
 hours at a constant temperature and in continual agitation.        In
 other cases the bath was allowed to cool very slowly, keeping it
 constantly agitated, and the observations were made during this
period of descent in the temperature, which was very favourable
to saturation.
    The greatest value was obtained for the elastic force at a given
 temperature, by suddenly cooling the balloon so as to induce an
 abundant condensation of the vapour, and then rapidly re-esta
blishing the original temperature.          By making observations
afterwards  every   quarter of an hour,  the temperature of the bath
remaining exactly the same, the elastic force will be found to
diminish gradually during several hours.
                                                                    If,

   The general tendency of these experiments is to show that the
elastic force of vapour of aether in the      constantly weaker               air   is
than         in
          vacuo.  The absolute difference    greater than with                 is
water, and increases with the elastic force itself.
  The experiments which have made with sulphuret

  In  these experiments             I
                            have noted the precise moment when
the vapour began to be deposited in drops on the walls of the
tube.    Ihave constantly found that the vapour is then still far
from  possessing the elastic force of 260 millims., which it pre
sents in vacuo.          If
                    the compression of the gas be continued, the
condensed liquid becomes more abundant and the tension of the
vapour increases, approaching more and more to that observed
in vacuo.   But an equality is not attained until a thick stratum
of liquid has collected on the surface of the mercury. Moreover
this equality is only to be observed immediately after the reduc
tion in volume, for the tension afterwards diminishes, and this
decrease continues to progress for several hours, although the
temperature may be carefully maintained.
   The explanation of these various facts appears to me to be very
simple.   When a volatile liquid in a limited space is in contact
at the same time with a gas which fills this space and with the
substance of which            its
                         walls are composed,             tendency

PART IV.--On the Elastic Force of the Vapours emitted by vola
           tile Liquids mired by mutual solution, or superposed.
     It   is generally admitted in works on physics, that a mixture
of several volatile substances      which do not combine chemi
cally, evolves complex vapours, of which the total elastic force
in a state of saturation is equal to the sum of the tensions which
F.
would be produced by each of the liquids separately.              This pro
            moreover, is nothing but a particular case of the general
  aw known as Dalton's law, and which would apply to every mix
ture of volatile fluids, permanent gases, or vapours.           This law is
said to have been established by Dalton, as the consequence of
direct experiments; and M. Biot, in his Traité de Physique
 (vol. i. p. 308), has described the process employed for this pur
pose.      This process is very imperfect, and it is difficult to ima
gine how Dalton can have obtained exact results from                  espe                    it,

16            M. V. Regnault              on the Elastic Forces             of Vapours
in the mixture, would have given too much complication to the
question. I have, of course, only operated upon liquids which
do not combine chemically by simple mixture.    But we must
commence by defining exactly what must be understood by sub
stances which react, or do not react chemically upon each other.
By substances which react chemically, we must understand those
which, when mixed, give rise to a new substance, endowed with
properties distinct from those of the primitive substances, and
constituted according to the rules of definite proportions. When
bodies are mutually soluble, they do not give rise to new com
pounds; nevertheless, in the phaenomenon of solution, particular
molecular actions take place, which distinctly modify certain                                         in
dividual physical properties.
    I shall divide the binary mixtures of volatile substances upon
which I have operated into three classes:–
    First class. Binary mixtures of volatile substances which are
not mutually soluble.
    Second class. Binary mixtures of volatile substances which are
mutually soluble in larger or smaller proportions, but which are
employed in such quantities, that, after reciprocal saturation,
there remain two separate liquids.
    Third class. Binary mixtures of volatile substances which are
mutually soluble in               all
                           proportions, and therefore always furnish
a single fluid.
   The process employed         these experiments
                                          in           the same   that      is                  as

fectly comparable.

  FIRST CLASS.–Binary mixtures of volatile         substances which
           exercise no sensible solvent action upon each other.
   The number of binary mixtures of this class which may be
experimented upon with certainty is much more restricted than
might be supposed at the first glance, since one essential con
dition in experiments of this kind       that the substances em       is,
ployed must      perfectly pure, and they must also both
                        be                                  suffi                                           be

their mixture                        be
                       determined with the necessary exactness.
Lastly,    it  probable that there are
                   is                      reality   two volatile           in                    no

     It   will be    from these tables, that the elastic forces ob
                     seen
served for the mixtures are very nearly equal to the sum of the
elastic forces given by the separate substances.           With sulphuret
of carbon and benzine the tension is            constantly  a little weaker
than the sum of the tensions.           The opposite result is presented
by the mixture of water and chloride of carbon.                nevertheless                 I
regard this latter fact as an anomaly, which                   attribute to                I
the circumstance, that, notwithstanding               the care which had     all
been taken, the chloride          carbon was not absolutely pure.

   These tables show that mixtures of sulphuret of carbon and
aether, far from giving vapours of a tension equal to the sum of
the tensions of the two separate vapours, exert an elastic force
which is generally less than that which would be produced by
the most volatile of the two liquids. The difference increases in
proportion to the volume of the less volatile liquid.

22            M.   W. Regnault on the Elastic Forces                        of   Vapours
   The preceding experiments relate to the elastic force of the
vapours furnished by mixtures of volatile liquids in the static
condition, that is to say, when the space containing the liquid
and the vapour is kept at a constant temperature.      It became
interesting to study them in the dynamic state, that is to say, to
determine the temperatures presented by the vapour and the
liquid when the mixture is boiled under different pressures.
My experiments have hitherto been made only upon liquid mix
tures of the first class, i.e. upon those composed of liquids which
exert no sensible solvent action upon each other, and which con
sequently remain superposed.
  Here we must distinguish two cases; that in which the more
volatile liquid forms the upper stratum, and that in which it
forms the lower. It is to the latter that I have principally
directed my attention, as it is for this that we may hope to obtain
the most constant results; the vapour of the more volatile liquid
is then compelled to traverse the less volatile supernatant liquid,
and is therefore placed in favourable conditions for becoming
saturated with        Nevertheless the phaenomenon appears
                           it.                                                                       to   be
very complex, because      depends upon the greater   less vivacity               its or

is of
    the ebullition. When the ebullition                            is
   found      is to
              be that   which the sum of the tensions of the two
                                    at

                              rendered more active, the ebullition
 becomes very violent, the temperature rises, and finally attains
 the point    which the more volatile liquid would boil under the
                   at
 same pressure           if
                     were alone.        probable that passages are

 then formed     the upper stratum
                        in             liquid, and that the vapour
 passing without obstacle does not sensibly carry     vapour from                 up
the less volatile liquid. These irregularities are particularly
 remarkable when ebullition takes place under low pressures.

  I      have            similar experiments upon two volatile

liquids which solidified at a readily obtainable temperature,
whilst still presenting a tension sufficiently strong to be mea

benzine,                                                                      -                                    .

evert no sensible influence upon the   tension of       vapour                                its               in

  I think that the    anomalies presented by monohydrated acetic
acid may   be  explained  by the presence of very small quantities
of foreign substances.    The acid obtained by simple crystalliza
tion probably contained a very small quantity of water in excess,
whilst the distilled acid contained a little acetone. As long as
the acid is liquid, the foreign matter is disseminated through                                     its
whole mass, and does not exert any sensible influence upon the
tension of  the vapour.    But this                       by     no
                                               means the case when
                                                     is
the acid becomes solid; then the foreign matter separates,                                         in
combination with       smaller quantity
                         a                 acetic acid, andof influ                         its

remarkable.

 waters,  that the only bodies existing in quantity sufficient to
 admit of their amount being determined, were soda, lime and
 magnesia, chlorine and sulphuric acid; free carbonic acid was
 indeed present, but it was impossible to take the brine from the
 pits, and as they issued from the delivery pipes in a state of
 foam, any attempt at the determination of this gaseous consti.
 tuent was rendered useless: the existence of other substances
 was also ascertained, but their amount was so small as effectu
 ally to elude detection, unless a considerable quantity of water
 was operated upon.     These waters contain 25 per cent, of solid
 matter; the evaporation of a comparatively small bulk of brine
 therefore yielded a residue which soon became cumbersome;
nearly two gallons of the Droitwich brine, and rather more than
one of that obtained at Stoke, were, however, evaporated.       The
plan of proceeding was to evaporate to a small bulk, and to test
portions of the mother-liquor poured off from the deposited
 salts; first, for bromine and iodine, by evaporation to dry
mess and exhaustion      with alcohol, repeating the process until
 a small saline residue was obtained; this was then examined
 in the usual manner by mixing thoroughly with starch-paste,
and adding a single drop of nitric acid.      Secondly and thirdly,
for potassa and lithia, by the appropriate and well-known
methods: the residue separated from the mother-liquor was
exhausted with nitric acid, and the acid liquid examined; for
iron, by converting the nitric into an acetic solution, and test
ing with ferrocyanide of potassium; for manganese, by Mr.
 W. Crum’s method, the reaction of binoxide of lead; for phos
phoric acid, by the action of molybdate of ammonia; and for
alumina, by igniting the solid produced by evaporating the acid
solution with nitrate of cobalt.    The residue insoluble in nitric
acid was further tested for fluorine and stront a by first submit
ting it to the process for producing hydrofluosilicic acid, and
then examining the insoluble residue resulting from that process
for strontia. Nitric acid and ammonia, arsenic, antimony, and
tin were tested for in separate portions of each water.
    As these brines closely resemble each other in their largely
occurring constituents, so do they also in the traces of substances
which they contain. Careful examination of a portion of the
mother-liquor, equivalent to half a gallon of the water, has shown
in the case of each the presence of a minute quantity of bromine,
but iodine appears to be totally absent: another portion of the
mother-liquor, representing about a quart of brine, has in both
instances yielded a distinct trace of potassa, whilst no evidence
of the presence of lithia has been obtained.      In the insoluble
residues a distinct trace of iron has been     found;   manganese,

      evidence of the presence of phosphoric acid was obtained in both
      waters, upon the addition of a small quantity of the nitric acid
      solution to a quite colourless and nearly dry mixture of nitric acid
      and molybdate of ammonia.       The search for fluorine and strontia
      has been unsuccessful; nor have any traces of nitric acid or am
      monia, antimony, arsenic, or tin been discovered; but on passing
      sulphuretted hydrogen through portions of the brines acidified
      with hydrochloric acid, a slight but decided brownish tinge was
      observed in both cases, such as is produced by the same reagent

Mr. A. B. Northcote                             on the Brine-springs               of Worcestershire.                 33
perial gallon.     It will be seen that the analysis which he made
  coincides more nearly with mine of the Stoke brine; but it
• must be remembered that at that time no shafts had been sunk
  at Stoke, a circumstance which might materially influence the
  neighbouring brine-springs.     Mr. Horner also had the choice of
  five brines, of which he  naturally selected the strongest. Con
  sidering, however, the lapse of time (more than forty years)
  between the two analyses, and the change which the methods of
  manipulation have undergone in the interim, they seem to me
  to bear sufficient resemblance to each other to prove that no
  material alteration has taken place in the composition of the
  brine; and among many similarities, two are worthy of remark.
  The temperature which he gives as that of the brine is 55° F.,
  whilst that which Lobserved, it will be remembered, was 54°5 F.;
  and he also states in his qualitative examination, that by the
  addition of ammonia to the water, a slight turbidity was occa
   sioned, due doubtless to the presence of a small quantity of the
  phosphates of lime or iron (alumina being absent, and silica
 virtually so).                       This is a circumstance which                       I also observed,            and
 subsequently found enough phosphoric acid to account for                                                               its
 OCCurrence.

this might appear most probable, when                          (taking
                                                                we remember that
into consideration the difference in the level of the localities) the
same depth has to be reached before the brine can be obtained,
yet I cannot but think that one circumstance tends to show that
this view is not the correct one ; for if such were the case, the
brine should in each instance rise to the same level in the dif
ferent shafts when left undisturbed by the action of the pumps.
Now under these conditions, the height to which it ascends at
Droitwich is about 166 feet; whilst at Stoke, starting from very
nearly the same level, the column of water rises to a height of
483 feet; this of itself is sufficient to show that no direct com
munication can take place between these two springs without
supposing a violation of one of the first principles of hydrostatics.
It might then be thought that a reference to the analyses before
given might decide this question; but on comparing the consti
tuents of the two waters, we can easily see that, taken alone, they
prove nothing, since the differences are such as might readily be
found in the same water when passing over slightly differing
deposits.   If the stream ran from Stoke to Droitwich, we might
suppose that in           its
                       course      met with strata containing more
                                       it
sulphate   oflime than      had it          as
                                   yet encountered, and      the same             at

earth’s motion. As the mean velocity of the vibrations might
be many times greater than has been supposed in this case, the
mass of the medium might be considerably less than this; but
we may be sure it is not incomparably less, not 100,000 times
as small for instance.   On the other hand, it is worth remarking
that the  preceding    estimate shows that what we know of the
mechanical value of light renders it in no way probable that the

       the Granite          of the Dublin        and Wicklow Mountains.                                41
of granite rock, that is to say, of                  a   mineral occurring in the sixth
system, whose rational formula is
                       (KO, NaO)SiO3+Al2O3, 3SiO3.
I mention this because there has existed           a good deal of confusion
as to the use of the terms orthose and           albite;  the former having
been commonly appropriated to minerals of the felspathic family
in which the alkali potash exists in excess, the latter to those in
which soda preponderates.            The true distinction unquestionably
rests on crystallographic form, as instances are to be found of
minerals included under the formula already given, occurring in
the fifth system, in which soda preponderates, and to which
therefore we should give the name orthose.                And vice versd of
specimens containing potash in excess occurring in the sixth
system, and which should therefore be called albite.
    It was very commonly believed until lately that this case of
the Mourne Mountains was a singular instance in Ireland.                      In
the    Proceedings    of the   Royal     Irish  Academy,    vol. v.  p.  351,                           I
find that Sir Robert Kane announced as a fact, that the felspar
 of the Dublin and Wicklow granites “was almost exclusively an
 albitic or soda felspar, containing only in some cases a small
quantity of replacing potash.” This conclusion he derived from
the analyses of some surface waters taken from the Three Rock
Mountain in the neighbourhood of Dublin, in which he found a
great preponderance of soda, but at the same time stated that
 “the fact was verified by a great number of analyses of speci
mens of granites taken from various parts of the great mass which
extends from Dublin into the county Wicklow. In                   the analyses   all
made, which included both ordinary granites and elvan                       gra                or
nite porphyries, both potash and soda were found present; and
the latter almost always            preponderant,
                                     so                     lead      the con
                                                                      as   to             to
 clusion that the     potash    should               in
                                               most cases       considered      be                      to
 belong   to the mica which the granite contained; and the felspar
 was almost exclusively             an
                                 albitic      soda felspar, containing only
                                                     or
in   some cases     asmall  quantity        replacing
                                                 of     potash.”
    These analyses, which             he
                                    stated had been made         the Museum     in
of   Irish Industry,          he
                           did not present          the Academy, nor have

the whole work is open to the same remark. Still, it is highly probable
that the heat of vapour plays a more important part in meteorological
phaenomena than has hitherto been generally supposed, and Mr.
Hopkins has done a real service to the science by calling attention
to this point.     If he has attributed rather too much to this particular
cause, it is only what is generally done, and might naturally be ex
pected, whenever a person discovers the importance of some cause
hitherto neglected.
    In treating of other points, such as the fluctuations of the baro
meter, dew, &c., our author does not appear to have availed himself
 sufficiently of the recent researches of Dove, Melloni, and others.
 The subject of 'dew' in particular has received the greatest accession
 of illustration and explanation by the labours of Melloni, to which
 Mr. Hopkins makes no reference whatever. We also meet with
 some expressions in the course of the work which indicate rather
 loose notions of elementary scientific principles; as, for instance, at
 page 72, where the author speaks of a current being “forced up” the
 sides of elevated land “by its inertia.”
    Upon the whole, however, the work is written in a scientific spirit,
 and indicates considerable care and labour in the collection of facts.
 Moreover, it is eminently suggestive, and therefore likely to be of
 still greater service by leading to further inquiries.

 THE    “On the Structure of certain Microscopic Test-objects, and their
 Action on the Transmitted Rays of Light.”              By Charles Brooke,
  M.A., F.R.S.
     In order to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions regarding the
  action of any transparent medium on light, it is necessary to form
  some    definite conceptions regarding the external form and in
  ternal structure of the medium. This observation appears to apply
  in full force to microscopic test-objects; and for the purposes of the
  present inquiry it will suffice to limit our observations to the struc
  ture of two well-known test-objects, the scales of Podura plumbea,
  and the siliceous loricae or valves of the genus Pleurosigma, freed
  from organic matter: the former of these is commonly adopted as
  the test of the defining power of an achromatic object-glass, and the
  several species of the latter as the tests of the penetrating or sepa
  rating power as it has been termed. The defining power depends
  only on the due correction of chromatic and spherical aberrations, so
  that the image of any point of an object formed on the retina may
  not overlap and confuse the images of adjacent points; this correc
  tion is never theoretically perfect, since there will always be residual
  terms in the general expression for the aberration, whatever prac

of some of the border tribes that occupy a sort of neutral, and not
yet undisputed, ground between the confines of the animal and vege
table kingdoms; as for example the Isthmia, which possesses a reti
culated structure, with depressions between the meshes, somewhat
analogous to that which would result from pasting together bobbin
net and tissue paper.
   The valves of P. angulatum and other similar objects have been
by some writers * supposed to be made up of two substances pos
 sessing different degrees of refractive power; but this hypothesis is
 purely gratuitous, since the observed phaenomena will naturally re
 sult from a series of rounded or lenticular protuberances of one
homogeneous substance.             Moreover, if the centres of the markings
were centres of      greatest    density,  if in fact the structure were at all
analogous to that of the crystalline lens, it is difficult to conceive
why the oblique rays only should be visibly affected. When P. hip
pocampus or P. formosum is illuminated by a Gillett's condenser, with
a central stop placed under the lenses, and viewed by a quarter-inch
object-glass of 70° aperture, both being accurately adjusted, we may
observe in succession, as the object-glass approaches the object, first
a series of well-defined bright dots; secondly, a series of dark dots
replacing these; and thirdly, the latter are again replaced by bright
dots, not however as well defined as the first series. A similar suc
cession of bright, dark, and bright points may be observed in the
centre of the markings of some species of Coscinodiscus from Ber
muda.

Royal Institution, proposed to explain the extreme darkness of the
dots, under certain conditions of focus and illumination, by the hy
pothesis that some of the oblique rays are thrown out of the field by
internal reflexion, being incident at the upper surface at an angle
too large for emergence; but this does not appear to invalidate the
present hypothesis respecting the course of the transmitted rays.
   It does not appear to be desirable that objects should be illumi
nated by an entire, or, as it may be termed, a solid cone of light of
much larger angle than that of the object-glass. The extinction of an
object by excess of illumination may be well illustrated by viewing
with a one-inch object-glass the Isthmia illuminated by Gillett's
condenser.    When this is in focus, and its full aperture open, the
markings above described are wholly invisible; but as the aperture
is successively diminished by the revolving diaphragm, the object be
comes more and more distinct, and is perfectly defined when the
aperture of the illuminating pencil is reduced to about 20°. The
same point may be attained, although with much sacrifice of defini
tion, by gradually depressing the condenser, so that the rays may
diverge before they reach the object; and it may be remarked gene
rally that the definition of objects is always most perfect, when an
illuminating pencil of suitable form is accurately adjusted to focus,
that  is,   so
            that the source      light and the plane

   This, it will be observed, is a triangular arrangement of the uneven
numbers in their regular order.
   Every cube is the sum of as many consecutive odd numbers as
there are units in the root *.
   The known theorem, that the sum of the cubes of any succession
of the natural numbers commencing with unity is equal to the square
of the sum of the roots, or, in other words, to the square of the cor
responding triangular number, is an immediate consequence of the
above.
                                                                                                          -

   The sum of any series of odd numbers commencing with unity
being equal to the square of the number of terms (A.), the sum of
the numbers in any triangle formed as above is necessarily equal to
the square of a triangular number.    It is also easy to see that each
cube is the difference between the squares of two consecutive trian
gular numbers; and, that the difference between the squares of any
two triangular numbers whatever is the sum of consecutive cubes.
The following equations have been found by ascertaining what dif
ferences of the squares of two triangular numbers are equal to single
cubes:—

   The sum of all the numbers contained in a square thus formed
is equal to the cube of the number which occupies the upper right
hand and lower left-hand corners. The sum of the numbers in either
of the diagonals is the corresponding square, and in the case of the
odd numbers the sum of the middle horizontal or vertical line is also
the square.
   This last-mentioned relation was pointed out by Lichtenberg +,
who stated the theorem thus:–If a be a whole number, and A be the
sum of all the natural numbers from 1 to a, them :
     a’=A+(A+a)+(A+2a)+(A+3a).....                                             +(A+[a—1]a).

   An uninterrupted arithmetical progression commencing with unity

to the square of an odd number; or, any square of an uneven
number minus 1 is divisible by 8, and the quotient is a triangular
number.

in human evacuations, he supposes that what is contained in the fat
of mutton or beef taken as food must be converted into margaric
acid in its passage through the alimentary canal.
   The lime precipitate, freed from excretine and dissolved in alcohol
by means of hydrochloric acid, forms a dark port-wine-coloured solu
tion, from which the margaric acid is deposited.      On then adding
water to the solution and   concentrating it on the water-bath, a flaky
colouring matter separates, which, being purified by solution in aether
and washing with water, is obtained as a dark-brown or black amor
phous substance, similar to the colouring matter of blood, and to
that which Dr. Harley has lately extracted from urine.
   The matters brought down with the lime having been thus ex
tracted, the sediment which                          spontaneously subsides from the                               alco
holic solution of faeces before its treatment with the milk of lime, is
next examined. This deposit appears to be complex in        nature;                                  its                it

oily globules, mixed sometimes with crystals   excretine and accom         of

     The Port-wine District extends eight leagues west and east from
 the Serra do Marão (an elevation of 4400 feet” from the level of the
 sea) to the Quinta do Baleira, near Sam João da Pesqueira, and
 four leagues north and south, between Villa Real and the city of
  Lamego T.
     The winter streams, tributaries to the Douro, on the right bank, are
 the Sermenha, Corgo, Ceira, Pinhão, and Tua; and, on the left, the
 Varoza, Temilobos, Tedo, Tavora, and Torto.
     At Baleira, the Douro runs at an elevation of not more than 250
 feet; whence some opinion may be formed of the nature and inequality
 of the country, and of the numerous abrupt mountain ridges, on the
 inclines of which the vines are grown.           The Wine-Districts of the
 Alto-Douro form a long irregular basin, girt by the granite chains
 of the Tras-os-Montes and Beira; and this being for the most part
 of schist formation, and protected from the bleak winds, is parti
 cularly adapted for the cultivation of the vine. The strata of the
 margins of the Douro differ from the higher and middle grounds
 in character, “being composed of strong clays, more or less
 micaceous.”
     The extreme northern and southern boundaries—from the Serra
do Marão to Favaios, and from the Serra do Monte Muro (near
Lamego) to Sam João da Pesqueira— are undulating mountain
plains of still heavier soil, and more suitable for the growth of firs
than vines. In former years, this fact was clearly defined by the
Royal Wine Company, who divided the districts into two, one
being termed Feitoria (where the most superior wines were produced
and classified for exportation), the other Ramo, where only very
inferior wines, for the consumption of the country and for distilla
tion, were produced to a small extent. Now, the two districts have
become one; the plantations of pines on the heights and the corn
producing valleys having alike been converted into vineyards; the
quantity, and not the quality, of the produce being the results sought
by the wine-grower within this privileged demarcation.
    One thousand vines generally produce a pipe of wine, and the
total number of vines in the Port-wine Districts above described
may be estimated at 90,000,000.
    In the summer time, there is great scarcity of water throughout
the district.       The vineyards are for the most part situated on abrupt
mountain slopes, the vines being planted on terraces, which are not
appropriate for the cultivation of anything else.               The vines are
grown not higher than three feet from the ground, and are planted
about six feet apart, supported with canes or stakes. The labour
in the vineyards is performed by the natives of Gallicia, who visit
the district three or four times a year in search of employment.
    In July 1850, I first observed a blight on three or four vines, at
a considerable distance from each other, in the Wine Districts. The

general appearance of this blight to the naked eye greatly resembled
that which appears on the peach-tree and the rose. The Douro
farmers had often previously noticed a similar po’ branco (white
powder) on the vines.
   In 1851 the season was favourable, and the vines (on which we
had observed the blight in the previous year) were vigorous, and
produced perfect fruit. The vintage of 1851, throughout the Alto
Douro, was excellent.     In 1852 there was much wet and cold ; the
blight again appeared, and the vines were attacked to the extent of
about one in fifteen hundred.     The vintage of 1852 was of inferior
quality; but no one ascribed the failure to any disease in the vine.
From the autumn of 1852 until midsummer 1853, continued rain,
sleet, hail, and bleak winds prevailed, and in 1853 there was no
spring. In March of the same year the navigation of the Douro
was impeded, and the bar rendered impassable on account of the
floods; and in April and May of the same year, prayers were offered
up in the churches throughout the Wine Districts for fine weather.
   In March 1854, only half-cargoes could be brought down the river
Douro, on account of the want of water, and rain was prayed for.
   Early in June 1853, the heat became suddenly intense, and the
vines had already burst forth with great vigour; whilst, in the
middle of the same month, the nights became as cold as in winter.
   In the most exposed situations the vines received the greatest
shock; the circulation of the sap was evidently deranged, and their
fruit withered as soon as it appeared. In some neighbouring vine
yards, less exposed, the grapes grew no larger than peas; they
were then suddenly covered with the blight (now designated the
 Oidium), and in about three days became rotten.
   On the inclines of the mountains on either bank of the river
Douro, the waters had run off, and but little blight appeared. In
the low and heavy grounds, the most sheltered from the winds,
the waters remained stagnant; yet the fruit grew to             its

at 800,000,000.
   If Flour of Sulphur be used, the leaves, branches and shoots are
first moistened as equally as possible with a syringe; then the
whole is dusted with sulphur, which adheres to the moistened
surface.                                                                         -
    This operation would have to be repeated thrice, and would con
 sume two ounces of sulphur for every vine, in each of the operations,
 making a total of 480,000,000 ounces, or about 13,392 tons for the
 treatment of the 80,000,000 vines in the Alto-Douro, and 133,920
 ‘ons for the vines of the whole country.
    Sulphur would not cost less than 10l. per ton, delivered in the
centre of the Alto-Douro districts, or in any other part of the                                         inte
rior of Portugal. The expense of sulphur required for the Douro
would be 133,920l., and for the whole country 1,339,200l.
    One man could moisten one vine in one minute, and another man
could dust it with sulphur in the same time, so that two men could
perform the complete operation on about 700 vines daily, at a cost
of 1s. 3d. each man for labour, making a total of 14,285l. in the
Alto-Douro, and 142,850l. for all Portugal.
    I will suppose that there are 4000 vineyards in the Alto-Douro,
planted each with 20,000 vines. The first cost of syringes and
fumigators would amount to not less than 10l. for each vineyard, or
a total of 40,000l. for the Alto-Douro.
    One quart of water would be required for every vine in each ope
ration, making a total of about 90,000 pipes, the cartage of which,
and the labour of distributing it over the mountain vineyards, in
tubs, on men's heads, would cost a minimum of 10s. per pipe, or a
total of 45,000l. for the Alto-Douro, and 450,000l. for the whole
country.

This is independent of any charge for factors or superintendents, or
for the extra expense in treating vines and vineyards which are so
much further apart than are those in the Alto-Douro.
   This expense to be incurred in the endeavour to save one year's
crop, would be equal to a charge of     10s. per pipe,       year41.                         or   toa

   Heintz has also found that when, to a mixture of two acids dif
fering by C*H*, a small quantity of one containing a larger amount
of carbon, and consequently more difficult of fusion, is added, the
melting-point becomes still lower by several degrees. For instance,
if about 3 to 4 parts of stearic acid, which melts at 124°26                                              F.,    be

                                                      at                F.,   of

mixtures, which also consist                      of
                                  three metals (lead, tin and bismuth).

    This equation is quite analogous to that which expresses the con
stitution of salicine :—
             C14H8 O* +               C12   His   O13    =     C26 His O14        + 2HO.

      It is remarkable that phillygenine is polymeric with saligenine,
for    the formula of saligenine tripled gives exactly that of philly
genine:—
                               3C14 HS O4          =     C42 H24 O12.

The action of chlorine and bromine on phillyrine is entirely analo
gous with their action on salicine.

                  WITHIN the last  three years         have been bold   I
                   enough, though only as an experimentalist, to
 put forth new views of magnetic action in papers having for
 titles, “On Lines of Magnetic Forcet,” and “On Physical
 Lines of Magnetic Forcef.” The first paper was simply an
 attempt to give, for the use of experimentalists and others, a
 correct expression of the dual nature, amount, and direction of
 the magnetic power both within and outside of magnets, apart
 from any assumption regarding the character of the source of the
 power; that the mind, in reasoning forward towards new develop
 ments and discoveries, might be free from the bondage and de
 leterious influence of assumptions of such a nature (3075. 3243.).
The second paper was a speculation respecting the possible phy
sical nature of the force, as existing outside of the magnet as well
as within      it,
                and within what are called magnetic bodies, and
was expressly described         being entirely hypothetical
                                       as                                                 in   its

fluid or aether is supposed to move in streams through magnets,

the opposite sides of these currents, shown by attraction and
repulsion of other currents, constitutes polarity.      Ampère's
view is modified (chiefly by addition) in various ways by Weber,
De la Rive, Matteucci, and others. My view of polarity is
founded upon the character in direction of the force itself, what
ever the cause of that force may be, and asserts that when an
electro-conducting body moving in a constant direction near or
between bodies acting magnetically on themselves or each other,

certain cases occur transverse to the     length,  and so produce
results which others explain by reverse polarity. The views of
very many parties always include the idea of the source of the
polar action, whether that be supposed to depend on the accu
mulation of magnetic fluids at the chief poles of the dominant
magnet, or the action of electric currents in a determinate posi
tion around its molecules; and such views are adhered to even
when the polarity induced is of the reverse kind, as in bismuth,
&c., to that of the inducing magnet.    Others, like Weber, add to
Ampère's hypothesis an idea of electricity, loose as regards the
particles, though inseparably associated with the mass of the
body under induction. Some,                          I
                                    think, make the polarity not
altogether dependent upon the dominant magnet, but upon the
neighbouring or surrounding substances; and          propose, if the      I
physical lines of force should hereafter be justified, to make that
which is commonly called polarity, in distinction from the true
polarity (3307.), dependent upon the better or worse magneto
conduction power of the substances presenting the usual polar
phaenomena (2818.).                                                -
   3309. The views of polar action and of magnetism itself, a
formerly entertained, have been powerfully agitated by the dis
covery of diamagnetism.                      I
                              was soon driven from my first sup
position, that the N pole of a magnet induced like or N polarity
in the near part of a piece of bismuth or phosphorus; but as
that view has been sustained by very eminent men, who tie up
with it the existence of magnetic fluids or closed electric currents
as the source of magnetic power, it claims continued exami
nation, for it will most likely be a touchstone and developer of
real scientific truth, whichever way the arguments may prevail.
To me the idea appears to involve, if not magnetic impossibi
lities, at least great contradiction and much confusion, some of
which       I
           proceed to state, but only with the desire of elucidating
the   general  subject.

Now these are precisely the actions which have been attributed
to polarity, and by which the assumed reverse polarities of para
magnetic and diamagnetic bodies have been considered as esta
blished; but when examined, how will ideas of polarity apply to
these cases, or they to it? The solution l points and acts like
bismuth in air and like iron in water; are we then to conclude
that it has reverse polarity in these cases? and if so, what are
the reasons and causes for such a singular contrast in that which
must be considered as dependent upon       internal     molecular               its              or

standard or copper ball. It is easy to understand, that if the
globe be moved parallel to itself, but away from the magnet, in
a line perpendicular to the magnetic axis (as into the dotted
position, 3352. fig. 13), it will pass through places of weaker
magnetic action. Under such changes of place, the induced
current was weaker or stronger, according to the distance, but
always in the same direction. Assuming that the rotating metal
does give a true indication of the polarity or direction of the
magnetic force (3077.), the results show that the polarity
of the force which induces these currents, and which is the
magnetic force of the dominant magnet, is the same both in the
copper and in the iron. Other cases of the current from revolving
iron may be referred to in the Exp. Res. (3162.).
   3354. The bismuth globe was placed in the magnetic field.
If  made to revolve much, with the galvanometer wire press
ing against the copper equator (3352.), the latter became
warm by friction, and a permanent thermo-current was pro
duced: this has been considered on a former occasion (3168.).
Its effect is easily eliminated by revolving the globe a given
number of times in opposite directions, observing the two
deflections, adding them together, and taking the half of the
sum for the amount of induced current in either one direction
or the other; for as the thermo-current is added on the one side
and subtracted on the other, such a process gives the real
amount of the induced current. When, however, the bismuth
sphere is revolved only five or ten times, the thermo-effect is so
small as to make the galvanometer deflection very little more in
one direction than in the other. When due attention was given,
the rotation of the bismuth sphere produced an induced current
in precisely the same direction as those obtained with the
copper and iron; and so far, therefore, it indicated precisely the
same direction of polarity for the magnetic force then acting
upon and in               it.
   3355. The hard steel sphere, having been previously examined
 by  asmall needle and found           unmagnetized, was placed
                                                   to   be                                 in
the magnetic field.       was then revolved, and gave

though not of good shape to retain magnetism, being very short,
yet it was able to sustain being placed in the magnetic field, in a
position the reverse of the polarity of that field, and yet retain
 itspolarity; for when taken out and examined             magnetic                                by   a

to new and important discoveries.         The polarity direction which
the moving conductor makes manifest, whether that conductor

be one of the paramagnetic or diamagnetic bodies themselves, or
whether it be a conductor moving amongst them, either by itself
or with them, is always the same.      The electric current pro
duced never indicates a change  in the direction of the polarity,
from that  belonging to the first source or seat of the power;
whether it be a magnet, a solenoid, or of any other nature; the
only difference being in the strength of the electric current
produced, which difference, is directly referable to the electro
conducting power (3143. 3152. 3163.).                   If
                                                such be the natural
truth, how can the two modes of indication ever give opposite
results?        If
                opposite results seem to appear, and only occa
sionally, is it that mode of induction which gives one consistent
result that we should doubt, or that which seems to be incon
sistent with itself? especially when similar contrary phaenomena
in abundance are known to be produced by bodies having
like polarity (3316), and when excellent physical reasons,
founded on differential action, offer themselves for their ex
plication. There is sufficient reason to admit, that the mag
netic needle cannot be always a true direct indicator of the
amount or the direction of magnetic action (2868. 2870. 3.156.
3293.).     Should we not therefore, in respect of the above phae
nomena, rather conclude, for the time, that the simple and uni
form results of the one mode of action, are the true indication;
and that where, in the other mode, the phaenomena are reversed
or doubled, a part of them are compound in their nature ?                            I
may, in conclusion, remark, that the effects of motion and those
produced in the action of magnetism on light, are never reversed
in any case, whatever the medium in which they are observed;
both point to one direction of polarity only, namely, that of the
dominant source of magnetism.                                    -

XIV.       On the Action             of the Violet and Ultra-violet Invisible Light.

          phaenomenon described by Stokes under the name fluor
THE    escence, led me to the supposition that this was caused by
the interference of the shorter system of waves, blue-violet and
ultra-violet (for the sake of shortness, the chemically-acting invi
sible rays of the spectrum may be so designated).       think, with               I
many others, that the eye has the greatest sensibility for a cer
 tain duration of vibration (the yellow light), and that it is the
 more sensitive for longer or shorter waves, the more these differ
 from the medium light in their depth or height.
    Light itself consists of the visible systems of waves, and
 besides these, of such as are longer than red and shorter than
 violet. As the combination of two tones is always deeper than
 each single one, out of which the compound tone arises, so from the
 interference of yellowand blue there can result onlylight of greater
length of undulation, and not violet light. Now since red has the
longest undulations of the visible light, the combination of red
 and yellow waves of light can only give a deeper tint than red,
 and consequently no visible light. A fluorescence in the dark
space of the spectrum near the red is not therefore to be expected.
 It is quite otherwise at the other end of the spectrum. The
 ultra-violet is the light acting in the dark space of the spectrum               by
 near the violet;           its
                         existence could only         shown      be   chemical   its

the light thus obtained to penetrate into the fluorescent bodies,

the cause of the partially slight success to the circumstance, that
I possessed no blue and violet glasses of sufficient purity, which
on that account allowed fewer of the more intensely acting rays
to pass through. At last the violet light occurred to me, which
results in the so-called electric egg when it is exhausted of air.
I tried its action on fluorescent bodies, and was delighted to see
that it produced some of the appearances described by Stokes,

   XV.    On the Law    of Absorption of Gases.         By R. BUNSEN4.
                                [With    a Plate.]
 GAsºº             bodies are absorbed by liquids on which they
          exert no chemical action, in quantities depending upon—
     1st. The essential nature of the gas and of the absorbing
 liquid;
    2nd. The temperature;
     3rd. The pressure to which the gas is subjected.
     The volume of gas, reduced to 0° and 0”76 pressure of
 mercury, which is absorbed by the unit volume of a liquid,
 under the pressure of 0"76 is called the absorption-coeffi
 cient, or coefficient of absorption.         The value of this absorption
 coefficient decreases in    general    with increase of temperature, in a
 ratio dependent upon the chemical nature of the absorbed gas
 and absorbing liquid.        The values of the absorption-coefficients
 for  varying   temperatures      can only be determined empirically.
 An   exact relation exists between the volumes of absorbed gast
 and the pressures ºnder which the absorption takes place, the
 amounts of gas absorbed varying directly as the pressure.
    The coefficient of absorption of any gas is therefore known
 when the following quantities are given:—1, the volume V,
 before the absorption, reduced to 0° and P pressure; 2nd, the
 volume VI remaining after the absorption reduced to 0° and P1
 pressure; and 3rd, the volume of the absorbing liquid.                    The
 amount of     gas  absorbed     by   the volume hi of    liquid  under the
 pressure P, is equal to the difference between the volume of gas
 originally taken, and that remaining unabsorbed,
                             _   VP         VIP,
                             T 0.76          0.76°
 If the pressure   during the absorption had not been P, but 0-76,
the amount of gas absorbed would have been, according to the
 above law,
                             VP
                             #-V.
 Hence it follows that the coefficient of absorption, i. e. the
amount of gas absorbed in the unit volume of liquid under the
pressure 0.76, is

     It
      is clear that, vice versd, the composition of an unknown
gaseous mixture may be found from the change of volume ensuing
from absorption by a liquid. In this way it is possible to analyse
mixtures of gases by a purely physical experiment unassisted by
chemical decomposition.     Such absorptiometric determinations,
as I term  them,  are, under certain conditions, scarcely less cor
rect than a chemical analysis, often much more simple and con
venient. Often, indeed, this mode of analysis is of immense
importance, as solving questions which by other methods are
not determinable.
  Let us next consider the case in which two gases are given
whose relation to each other is to be determined by an absorp
tiometric experiment.
   Let a be the original volume                  of the first           gas reduced to the
 ressure    l;

mined by the small thermometer c. The upper end of the outer
cylinder is closed by an iron lid having a hinge at one side, and
fastened down by means of a nut and screw attached to the iron
rim h, fitting into a small slit in the side of the lid. In the
middle of the cover inside there is a raised rim of iron, over
which    thick sheet of caoutchouc is extended and fastened by a
              a
screwed   ring s. This distended caoutchouc serves as a spring
against which the top of the tube can be pressed, keeping it in
a fixed position during the violent agitation necessary in the
process of absorption.
   The experiment itself is conducted in the following manner:—
A volume of the gas to be examined is first collected in the tube
over mercury, and the usual precautions taken in reading off,
&c., as in the reduction and measurement of gases. A measured
volume of water freed from air is next admitted under the mer
                                                                 .#
cury into the tube, which is then screwed tightly against the
caoutchouc plate, and the tube thus closed            in the cylin
der  containing  some  mercury,  and over that a quantity of water.
As soon as the pressure within and without has been equalised
by slightly turning the tube, it is again closed, and the whole
apparatus rapidly agitated for about a minute.      This agitation,
with  opening  and  closing of the tube, is continued many times,
until no further change of volume is perceptible.   The observa
tions necessary for the measurement and reduction of the residual
gas are then made.       Besides the temperature t and the baro
metric pressure   p,  four readings from the divided tube are re
quired:—
    1. The        lower surface      of mercury in the outer cylinder at a.
    2. The        upper surface      of mercury in the absorption-tube b.
    3. The        upper surface      of water in the absorption-tube at c.
    4. The        upper surface      of water in the outer cylinder at d.
   The method of calculation will be best explained by an example.
I select for this purpose an experiment on the determination of
the absorption-coefficient of nitrogen and water at 19°C.

     The accuracy of these determinations depends in a great mea
sure upon the water employed being perfectly free from air.
This is best accomplished by boiling the water briskly for several
hours, and then causing it to pass while still boiling into a bottle,
the neck of which has been drawn out to a fine point before the
blowpipe. The water is then again boiled for half an hour in
the bottle, and the end of the tube hermetically sealed, access of
air being prevented during the closing         pressing caoutchouc     by                   a
tube attached        the extremity. When the water thus freed

from  air, which should strike against the glass like          water                                 a

under mercury, and the water admitted directly into the absorp
tion-tube.     Before admitting the water, care must       taken that                        be
 no bubble          of
                air appears     the bottle, which would show imper

proves that, under these circumstances, it is not legitimate to
commence from a fixed ellipse.
   But from independent analytical principles (as illustrated in
the case already considered), it is certain that, under any
circumstances, it would be legitimate to commence from a fixed
ellipse,     if the   aggregate         of the terms h”–2pur-H Crº be of a higher
order of magnitude, estimated according to the disturbing force,
than the term —u'r”.        It is clear that they cannot be of a lower
order.
   It follows, therefore, inevitably, that the aggregate of the terms
h°–2pur-H Crº is of the same order of magnitude with respect to
the disturbing force as the term —a'r"; in other words, that they
contain the disturbing force as a factor.         It is not difficult to
point out the origin of this analytical circumstance.          The inte
gration by which the constant C is introduced (see Phil. Mag.
for April 1854, p. 279), may be effected by assuming only that
the increment in a given time of the sun’s true longitude is small
compared to that of the moon’s.        The remarkable integral I have
obtained in the    Supplement     to the Philosophical Magazine for
December 1854               (p.
                        521), shows that even that assumption         not                           is
necessary for effecting       integration. The limitation that the
                                        an
moon’s true longitude differs little from           mean value,   a made                       is

the equation which gives the apsidal distances must be solved as
a biquadratic, the term u'r" being of equal significance with the
others.   Since, therefore, from the foregoing reasoning, it
appears that               r is nearly      equal to

are given in the Philosophical Magazine for April 1854, p. 279,

rejected (Phil, Mag, for August 1854, p. 108), because it ap
peared to lead to the inference that the eccentricity is simply
proportional to the disturbing force. But by taking account, as
is done above, of the rate of angular motion of the apse, this
inference by no means follows, and the eccentricity is still a
function of the disturbing force, although the form of it may be
discoverable only by analytical investigation.
   It is particularly to be remarked, that the above general rea
soning only proves that, whatever be the law of the disturbing
force, and whether it be central or not, for a certain value of the
eccentricity the motion of the apse will be uniform.    But it does
not prove, that, under particular conditions, for instance, when
the disturbing force is wholly central, and the law of it is given,
uniform motion of the apse may not be consistent with any value
of the eccentricity. In a similar manner, the general theorem,
that every mass, whatever be                    its
                                  form, has three axes    perma                       of

taken the trouble to read the very clear directions for using the
reflective goniometer, given more than thirty years ago by the late

faces parallel to the axis of the graduated circle.            The descrip

 XVIII.      On Galvanic Circuits in which Perchloride of                        Iron enters
                 as an Element.    By Professor BUFF+.
 Soºn             of perchloride of iron has, as far as know, not
       hitherto been used as a liquid conductor in the formation
                                                                            I
of galvanic circuits.    The facility with which this body furthers
the oxidation of   hydrogen   and the electro-positive metals, com
bined with the possibility of producing it at a cheap rate, led to
the supposition that it might be very advantageously used as an
element in a constant electric circuit.      Occasional observations
which Liebig had made appeared to confirm this supposition,
and gave rise to the following investigation of the subject.
   The first experiments, made with a very pure, almost neutral
perchloride of iron, did not answer the expectations formed.
An ordinary charcoal zinc pair was used, in which nitric acid
was replaced by solution of perchloride of iron of syrupy consist
ence.    To measure the current, a tangent galvanometer was em
ployed, the simple ring of which was 200 millims. in diameter.
A stream regulator was inserted in order to obtain currents of
different intensities.   It was found that even the weakest, which
only just produced an action on the needle, showed no constancy.
At the same time the charcoal was covered with metallic iron
                                                                   * -
mixed with oxide of iron.
   Metallic iron dipped in solution of perchloride changes                             it,   as
is well known, into protochloride, being          the same time dis
                                                            at
solved.    This occurred with the iron     deposited     the charcoal  on
when allowed       stand some time
                    to                         in
                                          the solution.   During the
progress     the electric decomposition the time was too short for
             of
this; the charcoal polarized itself with the iron, and       constant            no
Current could result.
  When the neutral, saturated solution         perchloride was de

hard, crystalline laminae, accompanied

   The circuit thus composed showed a satisfactory constancy as

showed, a short time after the circuit had been closed, a slight
decrease.    The inconstancy of the current increased slowly but
gradually with a deviation of 30° or 40°. The time was mani

to be changed again into hydrochloric acid; for when the circuit
was opened a short time, the original strength of the current
was regularly established.    The deviation of 14° remained un
changed even when the circuit was kept closed longer than two
hours. A current which deviated the needle 45° would, accord
ing to experiment, have separated in 31 seconds 1 millegramme
of hydrogen. By a deviation of 14° the same quantity requires
accordingly 124 seconds.     The constancy of this electromotive
couple extends therefore only to those currents whose chemically
decomposing power does not exceed 1 millegramme hydrogen in
124 seconds.
   Manifestly this only holds good for an element of the dimen
sions employed.     They were the usual ones; a charcoal cylinder
of 5.7 centimetres interior width by 13.5 centimetres high, of
which, however, only 8.5 centimetres were in contact with the
solution; the zinc cylinder, 9 centimetres high and 4 centi
metres wide, dipped in sulphuric acid of 1:25 spec. grav, con
tained in a porous cell which almost filled the cylindrical exca
vation of the charcoal.    Of course with a greater extent of the
electromotor, particularly when a greater surface of the charcoal
was placed in contact with the liquid, constant streams of greater
strength would be obtained.
   A still more favourable result presented itself when the sul
phuric acid in the porous cell was changed for a concentrated
solution of common salt.
   The constancy extended now to a deviation of 22° (one mille
gramme of hydrogen in 77 seconds), and the retrograde motion of
the needle by higher deviations was smaller than in the preceding
case. There was, further, neither deposition of iron, nor evolu
tion of gas at the charcoal cylinder; not even when the circuit
was directly closed by a short, thick, copper wire.      A fine pla
tinum wire was kept in a state of incandescence.
   Compared with other galvanic elements, the perchloride of
iron element, as far as power and constancy is concerned, is

inferior to Bunsen’s, but superior to Daniell's.            Without re
placing the former, it may be preferred in many cases to the
latter. A Daniell’s battery of equal surface did not show an
equal constancy above a deviation of 12°.
   In the latter, a gradual intermixture of the liquids by endos
mose occurred more rapidly, and was attended with greater dis
 advantages than with the perchloride of iron circuit.            For in
the sulphate of copper circuit, the zinc covers itself by degrees
 with copper, and loses thereby a part of          exciting force; while       its

  This constant galvanic apparatus stands thus almost exactly
in the middle between the constant charcoal element and the
constant copper element.   Before the latter, it has the prefer
ence of greater force and constancy; while in common with                                                          it,

without evolving injurious vapours.

    If an accident happens to Daniell’s instrument, the injury is
                                                                                                   º
irreparable; but if a thermometer or collar happens to give way
in the hygrometer under consideration, the damage is easily set
right at a trifling expense. The same brass stopper will always
answer again.
     I
     ought to have mentioned formerly, that a little key of brass,
to be fitted, when required, into the ivory collar at O, is
in screwing and unscrewing the ivory collar; and that the other
extremity of this key may be inserted with advantage into the
neck of the little brass bottle, to aid in the same operations
regarding the bottle.
   In cold and dry weather in winter it is very essential that the
ather should be the very best commercial aether, and probably
fresh aether used for each observation. In summer, the superior
excellence of the aether is by no means so important; and the
used aether of winter might be kept in a properly stopped bottle
 forsummer use, with     slight addition
                                       a     fresh aether,   formerly of                         as
explained.   Spare leather washers ought            accompany every             to

the separation of two bases approximating so closely in their boil
ing-points as aniline and the substance I expected to find, could
not be effected by fractionated distillation, or at least only by an
expenditure of time, labour and material, altogether out of pro
portion to the importance of the object to be attained,         endea                            I

that the other members of the picoline series gave highly soluble

                                      conceived that by converting
the mixed bases into salts of that   acid, it would be easy to sepa
rate the rather sparingly soluble and highly crystallizable oxalate
of aniline, and obtain the oxalate of the other base in a state of
purity.     But this expectation was not confirmed by experiment;
for neither from the portion boiling about 340°, nor even from
that collected at 360°, and corresponding therefore with the
boiling-point of pure aniline, could the slightest trace of crystal
lized oxalate of aniline be obtained, although both fractions gave
the reaction of that base in the most powerful manner.             The
experiment was varied in every possible way by the use of water,
spirit, and absolute alcohol, but by allowing these fluids to eva
porate spontaneously only a thick syrup was obtained, without
the slightest indication of crystallization.     Even the addition of
aether to          its
              alcoholic solution gave only       syrupy fluid, and   a                                         no

to this circumstance            I
                           have not been able to submit it to purifi
cation and   analysis,  so as to ascertain whether it really is nitro
benzide; but though that substance has not yet been obtained
by a similar action on pure aniline, it is quite possible that it
may be produced, and the reason why it has not hitherto been
observed is probably because no one has had occasion to sacrifice
large quantities of aniline in this manner.      The acid solution of
the  undecomposed      base is passed  through a wet filter in order to
separate the oil, and the fluid boiled for some time to expel the
last traces.   On saturation with potash and distillation, an oily
base passed over with the water and collected on the surface.
This base, on being converted into a platinum salt, was found
still to give a result greatly above that required by theory for
the substance of which                  I
                            was in quest.  On submitting it to
distillation, it was found to commence boiling at about 320°,
and hence to contain a large quantity of lutidine; and it was
only the very last portion which gave a platinum salt corre
sponding with theory.         It was clear that a large quantity of                                          lu
tidine had been retained at a boiling-point above that which

tion, not possessing a sufficient amount of culture to enable him to
form an independent judgment, accepts the fallacy, and attributes
the absence of clearness to his own, rather than to his teacher's want
of understanding, whereas the latter is often the true cause of failure.
Now there is no task more responsible than that of the man who
undertakes to write a book for the instruction of the community in
science, and no man ought to embark in such an undertaking who
is not prompted by higher motives than the mere hope of commercial
success. He must love his subject.         Years of alliance with it must
have made him master of it up to its boundaries, and enabled him to
detach the hypothetical from the true.           He must know the true
value of those images by which natural truths are connected, and
rendered intelligible to the human mind; a knowledge necessary to
preserve him from confounding the symbols of science with its veri
ties.    He must himself be an investigator, and his skill as such must
be ratified by his own discoveries and his manner of communicating
them, before his qualifications are complete.
    Few, we imagine, possess the requirements to which we have
alluded, in a greater degree than the writer of the book before us.
His lifetime has been spent in the investigation of the subject on
which he writes. On almost every page we find evidence that the
man-is not writing from hearsay merely, but that the experiments
he records have been repeated by himself, and come to us with
the sanction of his own authority.      There is no portion of frictional
electricity which has been left untouched: on                            all

    I purpose placing       before the Royal Society in this communication,
the   principal    results of experiments made during the months of
June and      July  last, on the impregnation of the ovum in Gasterosteus

detailed account of my observations on a future occasion.

spot, such as an aperture would produce, is always visible.                    If a
section be made of the egg, and the apex brought into focus from
within, the same clear spot is well seen, and the fine and regularly
dotted structure of the chorion is seem to cease suddenly at the
margin of the clear spot.
    The general form of the egg after deposition is round, but it is
rendered irregular by indentations caused by the pressure of other
eggs. It is inelastic, and retains impressions made in it by a needle;
and when placed in water, these characters remain for a long time if
it be not impregnated,—a fact which indicates that water does not
pass through the micropyle, or by imbibition through the chorion.
The viscid secretion of the oviduct which invests the eggs may
defend them against the action of water, in which it does not readily
diffuse or dissolve. This secretion has an alkaline reaction. The
substance of the yelk has a decidedly acid reaction,--more                    than
enough to neutralize the alkalinity of the viscid secretion. This
reaction       is,

begins on one side near the equator, and soon forms a circular con
striction which gives the yelk the figure of a dumb-bell, the longer
axis of which is the polar axis of the egg. The constriction travels
towards the germinal pole, and next produees a flask-shaped figure;
this is at length lost by the constriction passing on, and the round
form is regained in about a minute.             This wave reappears and
travels forward again without any distinct period of rest, and I have
seen these movements continue for forty-five minutes, though towards
the latter part of this period they are less distinct and more limited
in extent. The germinal mass has itself during these contractions,
which strongly resemble the peristaltic movements of the intestine,
undergone changes in form, and has increased in bulk and distinctness.
These movements are unaffected by weak galvanic currents.
   During the passage forward of each wave of contraction there is
an oscillation of the whole mass of the yelk, so that                germinal                       its
pole passes once         the right and ouce

 did not appear to rise beyond 0”036 to 0"-038 at 69°F., and only
 to 0”020 to 0”022 at 53°6 F., as appeared from the iodides of
 mercury which were deposited upon the walls of the tube.          In the
 vaults of the observatory, it is true, the red iodide formed a very thin
ring, and this ring was only at a distance of a few millimetres from
 the mercury; this, which could not be foreseen from the previous
results, must be attributed to the moisture, the iodine tubes having
been fixed against the wall.     In fifteen days, at a temperature of
 72°5 F. in the meridian chamber of the observatory, an amalgam of
silver gave rise to a much larger ring with vapour of iodine. This
ring was formed of very distinct crystals of determinable form; it
was at 0”015 from the amalgam.          In most of the experiments with
iodine, the ring formed consisted of several iodides of the metal, but
the red crystallized iodide formed the greater portion, or existed alone
when the vapour of iodine being in slight excess, the experiment
was stopped at the proper time.      By means of a tube of 1 metre in
length placed vertically in a larger tube resting upon mercury, John
Davy's experiment was verified, proving that iodine, placed at a
distance from mercury at the ordinary temperature, absorbs the
vapour of the latter.    This agrees with the result furnished by vesi.
cular sulphur, and shows well that if the mercurial atmosphere ap
pears to be limited when the iodine is in the state of vapour, this
arises solely from the circumstance, that the vapour of iodide of mer
cury, and even that of iodine, have a considerable density compared
with the air. Hence it results that the vapour of mercury is repelled
to a certain limit which varies with the temperature, whilst the rings
formed by the iodides of mercury are at a tolerably constant height
at the same temperature.      The vapour of bromine at ordinary tem
peratures has the same action as that of iodine, as also the vapour of
                                                                         -

XXIV.       Further Observations on associated cases, in Electric Induc
    tion,  of Current and Static Effects.       By Professor FARADAY,
    D.C.L., F.R.S. &c.4
MPION,               whose loss science must deeply feel, was engaged
            in the latter part of his life in investigations relating
to static electricity, especially concerning induction, conduc
tion, &c. He desired, in reference to these and the results had        I
published respecting the charge of, and conduction by, subter
raneous and subaqueous insulated wirest, to know whether there
was any difference in the time of transmission through such wires,
of currents having greater or less intensity, i.e. of currents from
batteries of different numbers of plates.       I applied to Mr. Latimer
Clark on the subject; and he with the same earnestness as on
the former occasion, sought and seized the opportunity of making
experiments of the like kind, and gave me the results, which                I
sent to    Melloni. The latter published them with some observa
tions in an Italian Journal (whose title is not on the paper
which he sent to me), and soon after he was suddenly removed
from us by death.         As Mr. Clark’s results are not yet known
in this country, I have thought that a brief account of them
would be valuable.        His process records, by the printing tele
graph of Bain, the results obtained with 768 miles of copper
wire covered with gutta percha, and laid in the ground in four
lines between London and Manchester, so connected that the
beginning and the end of the whole length was in London.
The following are his words, dated May 31, 1854:-
    “I    have tried a few experiments on the relative velocities of
currents of different intensities, and I enclose you some strips of

                              was unable to equalize the deflec
tions of a galvanometer by currents of intensity with small plates
as compared with currents from a few large plates, for no size
of plate would make up for the deficiency in intensity.    allude                                              I
to the form of experiment suggested by Melloni;-but       believe                                           I
they will be of interest to him.
   “The experiments were made through 768 miles of gutta
percha wire, viz. from London to Manchester and back again
twice, with our ordinary sulphate of copper batteries, plates
3 inches square, and with intensities varying from 31 cells to
sixteen times 31 cells, or 500 cells.
   “In the accompanying strips the upper line indicates the
time during which the current was sent, being made by a local
arrangement.
        “The
          second line (of dots) indicates time by seconds, being
made by a pendulum vibrating seconds, and striking a light
spring at the centre of   arc   vibration.        its            of
  “The third line indicates the time         which the current                        at

miles off.
   “The fourth line merely shows the residual discharge from
the near end     the wire, which was allowed
                          of                    communicate with                           to

          a                                                 be, that                                      to

  Melloni has then given copy       the records made when

recently made with regard to time. That, however, does not
appear to me to be the case, as a few further observations on Mr.
Clark’s recent experiments will perhaps show. When the smaller
battery is used, much less electricity passes into the wire in a
given time, than when the larger one is employed.     Suppose that
the batteries are so different that the quantities are as 1 to 10;
then, though a pulse from each would take the same time for
transmission through the wire, still it is evident that the wire
would be a tenfold better conductor for the weak current than
for the strong one; or in other words, that a wire having only
one-tenth of the mass of that used for the greater current should
be employed for the smaller one, if the resistance for equal quan
tities of electricity having different intensities is to be rendered
equal.
   My  views connect the retardation of the transmitted current
with the momentary induction set up laterally by the insulated
and externally coated wire. The induction will be proportionate
to the intensity, and therefore     especial effect  its
                                                     the time                      on               of

alike in power unto the end of the current, and then a difference
again appears which is complementary to the first.
    There are many variations of these experiments which one
 would wish to make, if possible, and perhaps by degrees the pos
 sibility, or else equivalent experiments in other forms, may occur.
If  the wire employed were changed from a cylinder to a flat
ribbon of equal weight, or to several small wires,           being equally        all
coated with gutta percha and submerged, differences would pro
bably arise        in
                    the time       delay with the same current; and
                                         of                                                        I
think that the ribbon, presenting more induction surface than the
cylinder, would cause more delay; but probably any one               these,                  of
or
of      like  varieties, would cause the same       delay  for currents                             of
different intensities. Again, one can scarcely doubt that with
different conducting substances,                       as
                                            iron and copper, the delay
would     vary,    as  the case

     If the   reader      will refer      to    what   I     have said          in   the conclusion
       my
of          second paper, published                   in   the August Number                 of   this
Journal for 1854,              he
                            will find that the claims    the doctrine             of
which  I      havé put forth are made     rest upon its satisfaction
                                                        to                                          of
the following requirements:—
   1st. That the principles upon which                               its   methods       are founded
should be of an axiomatic nature.
                          *    Communicated             by   the Author.

166         Prof. Boole on certain Propositions in Algebra
    2nd. That they should lead to results capable of verification,
wherever verification is possible.
     3rd. That they should be capable of a systematic development
consistent in all its parts and processes, and neither acknow
ledging nor imposing any limitations but those which exist in
 the nature of things.
     Now the principles in which, and in the mode of the application
 of which, that doctrine consists, have been fully stated in this
 Journal (December 1854). In so far as they may be considered
 novel, they are certainly in no proper sense mathematical.        I do
  not indeed conceive that    they  are in  any  respect  novel, except
  that they are brought into a novel connexion, and are made the
  basis of a new application.     I do not think that any person com
  petent to form an opinion upon these subjects would dispute
  such positions as the following: viz. 1st, that probability is rela
  tive—that it depends, not upon the actual connexions of things,
  but upon those connexions as known to us; 2nd, that the di
   stinction of events into simple and compound is relative, and
   the selection of simple terms arbitrary and the offspring of lan
   guage; 3rd, that merely logical connexions which are founded
   upon definition possess only a derived necessity, and that from
   the contemplation of things or events defined, and subject as such
   to relations founded upon definition, we may ascend to the con
   templation of things free, and only to be expressed by signs of
   larger comprehension, but from which, by introducing the limi
   tation again, the conception of the more restricted class may be
   derived.    I say, for instance, that between the term “king”
   and some other term which we will suppose to designate a mem
   ber of a particular legislative body, relations founded upon defi
   mition of the respective terms might exist, which relations would
   cease to exist if we ascended to the larger terms of “ruler” and
   “legislator,” and would be restored when we imposed upon those
   terms the former limitations.      Now these are principles which
   are not in  any  proper sense mathematical.     They would seem to
   belong far more to the psychologist and to the inquirer into the
   nature of language than to the mathematician.       I have, however,
   shown that in connexion with received principles they form a
   valid basis for the theory of probabilities; and in my treatise
   on the Laws of Thought numerous verifications of the results
   of that theory will be found.     I  proceed now to that which     I
  consider the most important of all, the proof that this theory
  satisfies the third and last of the conditions above adverted to.
      The argument which I purpose to develope is the following.
  In the demonstration of the general method in probabilities,
  published in this Journal (December 1854) and in the Laws of
  Thought, we ascend, in accordance with the third of the princi

                               connected       with the Theory of Probabilities.                                          167
 ples above stated, from the events whose probabilities are given,
 and whose logical connexion is explicitly determined from their
 definition, to events which are free, and from which by limita
 tion the former are derived. Of those “free” events, the unknown
 probabilities s, t, &c. are involved in the final algebraic equa
 tions to which the method conducts.    As probabilities they ought
 to admit of positive fractional values.      Now it will be shown
 that they do admit of such values when the data represent a
 possible experience, and not otherwise. The conditions of pos
 sibility in the data are identically the conditions of mathematical
 consistency in the method.      Other important consequences are
 connected with this    demonstration,   to which attention will be
 directed.
                                                         Proposition               I.

the last fractional.
   Now the general proof of the proposition consists in showing,
that if it is true for a particular value of n, it is true for the next
greater value, and so on ad infinitum. Wherefore, since it is
actually true for the case of n=1, it is true universally.
   We shall therefore begin by assuming that the proposition
is true for      n–lvariables.  And making this assumption, let us
suppose the first n—l equation of the system (1) to be satisfied
while z varies from 0 to Oc, and seek under these circumstances
the nature of the variation which the first member of the final
equation of the system undergoes.
   Now if a particular positive value be given to 2, the n-1 first
equations of the system (1) will assume the form of a correspond
ing system relative to the n-1 variables a, y,     which remain.                   ...
Thus   if   in
             the  equations (2) and (3)     give         particular     we          to   2

The mode of eliminating A, u, v, &c. from the above combined
systems is given in my paper ‘On the Conditions by which the
Solutions of Questions in the Theory of Probabilities are limited,’
published in this Journal (August 1854). And the actual eli
mination leads to the following results: viz. 1st, that p, q, and r
must be positive fractional quantities; 2nd, that they must
satisfy the conditions
                        q+rip,              p+       rj       q,        p+q       =    r.
These conditions, then, at least must be satisfied in order that
the system (15) may admit of solution in positive values of w, y, z.
To the quantity r they assign the inferior limits        and q-p,                       p-q
and the superior limits p + q and 1.
   Exactly the same method is applicable to every form and
variety of the system (14), the final result always being a system
of linear inequations connecting the fractional positive quanti
ties p, q,   ...   r.
   The conditions above determined are, moreover, the only ones
which are necessary         order that the system (14) may admit

of the  system (15), the first member of the final equation will,
when   z=0,   coincide with the highest of the inferior limits of r
above determined, and when z = 0 with the lowest of the superior
limits; for the highest inferior and the lowest superior limit
are the true limits of r, as above determined, on the assumption
that w, y, z are positive quantities.  And therefore they are the
true limits of the first member of the final equations under the
same conditions.
   Thus it has been shown that as 2 varies from 0 to infinity,
while a and y are positive quantities constantly determined so
as to satisfy the two first equations of the system (15), the first
member of the final equation of (15) will vary from the highest
of the inferior to the lowest of the superior limits of r. In the
variation it must once, or more often, coincide with the actual
value of r. But that it cannot more often than once coincide with
r is evident from the constitution of Ha (Prop. I.), which does not
permit that the function in question should ever resume a former
value while 2 continues to increase.      For if such resumption
were   possible, a maximum or minimum value of the function
would intervene; and this, as H, continues to consist of positive
terms only, cannot happen.     One solution therefore exists, and
one  only, of the system (15) in positive values of a, y, .. 2 when

    178              On the Theory of Probabilities.
       Now there is nothing special in this reasoning. It is equally
    applicable  to every form of V, and establishes the identity of the
    conditions of possible experience in the data of a question of
    probabilities, and those of mathematical consistency in the final
    processes by which the question is solved.
      Other remarkable consequences, to which            I shall   but slightly
    advert, flow from these investigations.
        Thus it follows from them that the numerical value of any
    probability determined by the general method will always, pro
    vided that the problem be a real one, satisfy those necessary and
    sufficient conditions of limitation, the mode of determining which
    I  have illustrated in the August Number of this Journal (1854).
        It follows hence, that two modes of procedure are open to us
    for the limiting of the solutions of questions of probability. We
    can either determine simultaneously the conditions of possible
    experience and those of final limitation, by the special method for
    this purpose developed in this Journal (August 1854), or, dispen
    sing with this preliminary inquiry, we can so order the process
    of solution by the general method as to cause the different sets
    of values of the quantities s, t, &c. to be distinctly evolved.
    Then, if among those sets there be found one that is wholly
    positive, the conditions of possible experience will be implicitly
    satisfied, and the final value of the probability sought will itself
    also satisfy the conditions of limitation to which the preliminary
    inquiry would have conducted us.       It is obvious that the former
    is the easier mode of procedure.
        Iwould beg, in conclusion, to observe that I have in the
    analytical portion of this paper aimed at little more than to give
    an account of researches not yet quite finished. The general
    proof of the properties of the functions       K    and   \, I   hope at no
    distant time to be able to complete and lay before the public. In
    the meanwhile I do not desire that they should be received with
    any greater confidence than the verifications actually furnished
    may seem to warrant.      Of the function K it seems not impro
    bable that other and    important  applications may yet be made.
    The conclusions to which these researches point is this, that
    the theory which they are designed to test is a rigorously con
    sistent one; that the conditions of      its
                                            mathematical validity are
                                     is of
    identical with the conditions      possible experience.     Now             I
-   apprehend that this character      peculiar       the theory under
                                                         to
    consideration.   Upon   no merely mathematical basis could     doc  a

   The experiment gave therefore, in fact, rather a smaller coeffi
cient. In spite, however, of the most careful purification, the
mercury always caused a black turbidity in the water, which
perceptibly increased with agitation. This circumstance, and
the fact that the coefficients determined one after the other in
the same liquid and at the same temperature always regularly
increased, showed that this method was not to be relied upon
for exact results.   I have preferred, therefore, to determine the
coefficients by an indirect method.

   We have           in the former part of the paper that the relative
                    seen
proportion in which the constituents of a mixture of gases are
absorbed by water does not alone depend upon their several
absorption-coefficients,     but also upon the relative proportions in
which   they are mixed.      If the absorption-coefficients are different,
the gases dissolved in the water are not in the same relation as
those in the free gas. This last undergoes therefore a change
in   itscomposition, which varies with the relation           the mass                  of                     of
                           the gas.     For this reason the absorption
                     of to

coefficient       mixed gas can only                        be

    When this is calculated, negative values for 21+8, and for

  —0.3325 and —0.34807, instead of the sums of the coefficients
 found in the tables for methyle and hydrogen, +0.07376 and

may differ so little by the temperatures at which the curves of
absorption approach, cut, or are tangent to each other, that a
second absorptiometric experiment is necessary.    The foregoing
experiments, for example, give a value for a, at the temperature
19°, of 0.0204: this varies very slightly from the absorption
coefficient of carbonic oxide at 19°, which is found in the table

but  a small quantity of dissolved salts, there are some whose
absorption-coefficients  differ but slightly from those of pure
water, and contain carbonic acid gas alone in solution.      such           If
springs, as is usually the case, are saturated with gas, a certain
 limit for the amount of contained carbonic acid may be found.
This limit of the quantity of carbonic acid depends upon, 1st,
 the temperature of the spring; 2nd, the depth of the shaft of
the spring; 3rd, the height of the spring above the sea. Springs
of the above sort, which are saturated with a stream of chemi
cally pure carbonic acid, and rise without pressure at the level
of the sea, give according to their temperature very different

   If the same spring under otherwise similar circumstances rose
at an elevation above the sea, where the average atmospheric
pressure was only two-thirds of the mean height of the barome
tric column, it would contain only two-thirds of the above
amount of dissolved carbonic acid.
  Hence          be perceived that the amount of gas in a spring
            it will
which is saturated with pure carbonic acid, may be considerably
augmented by deepening the spring shaft, and thus increasing
the column of water under which the gas issues from the earth,
as Bischoff has indeed already shown in his admirable researches
on the phaenomena of springs.

   From this table it is plainly seen, that if the gas passing
through a spring at 15°l contains only 10 per cent. of carbonic
acid with 90 per cent, of nitrogen, the gas dissolved in the
spring water will contain 42.948 per cent. of carbonic acid.    In
this way it is easy, in analyses of mineral waters, to calculate
the composition of the gases contained in the water, if the com
position of the gas which is set free in the spring is known by
experiment.    If the composition of both gases is directly deter
mined, and the experimental composition agrees with that found
by calculation, we have a most valuable confirmation of the cor
rectness of both analyses.
   All these deductions from the law of absorption are of course
only applicable to cases in which a statical equilibrium between
the free and dissolved gases can ensue. This is not only the
case in springs through which gases pass, but particularly in rain
and dew, and for these is the law applicable with         greatest                             its
precision.

Hence it follows that the amount of carbonic acid which a cubic
millimetre of the sapº from the leaves exposed to the air is able
to absorb at 15° and Om'76 pressure, is never more than 0-000415
cubic millimetre, whilst the moisture in the loose earth around
the roots may contain 0.00626 cubic millimetre, or nearly fifteen
times as much. The great productiveness of mould rich in
humus, and a part of the advantages which the agriculturist
derives from breaking up his land, is easily explained from these
phaenomena.
   The phaenomena of the oceanic atmosphere, as well as of the
absorption of air in the blood, which are deducible from the law

 Now, since C is positive for an elliptic orbit, or one approaching
to an ellipse, if this equation contains two positive roots, it
must, by the theory of equations, contain a third positive root,
because the last term is negative.     Hence there must be a third
apsidal distance in addition to the two belonging to the approx
imate ellipse. The third apse is accounted for by considering
that if the radius-vector be very large, and consequently u very
small, the repulsive part of the force, viz. —#, may exceed the
attractive  part puuº, even when p' is supposed to be small.
Hence the analysis embraces a separate curve, containing                                        in
finite branches and one apsidal distance, in addition to the
eccentric orbit.

adopted which will exclude the third apsidal distance.       One
method proper for this purpose      that indicated is   Mr. Airy                  by

These results show, since 6 may be supposed positive, that
6+B will be less than 90°, and that, as A is positive, u has a
maximum value if 24 be less than unity, but cannot in that
case have a minimum value.          Hence as q is by supposition a                                                          .

 netic pole.  Substituting elongated tubes for spheres, you find
 that when a tube containing a solution of a certain strength is
 suspended in a weaker solution, between the two poles of a
 magnet, the tube sets from pole to pole; but that when the
 solution without the tube is stronger than that within        the                                           it,

netic weight of the cube would be less than that of the medium.
Acted upon in the former direction, the cube would be a neutral
body; acted upon in the latter direction, it would be a diamag
netic body. If the magnetic capacity of the cube diminish still
further, it will, according to your hypothesis, become wholly
diamagnetic.    Now it is evident, supposing the true magnetic
excitement to continue,  that the cube, when acted on by the
magnet in the direction of compression, will approach nearer to
the magnetic weight of the medium in which we suppose it im
         than when the action is across the said line; and,
hence, the repulsion of the cube, when the force acts along the
 line of compression,                           must be less than when the force acts
 across             it.
    Reasoning thus from the assumption of a magnetic medium
 in space, we arrive at a conclusion which can be brought to the
 test of experiment.                                                I
                             So far as can see at present, the assump
tion is negatived by this test; for in diamagnetic bodies the
repulsion along the line in which the pressure is exerted is
proved by experiment to be a marimum *.                    An ordinary mag
metic excitement could not, it appears to me, be accompanied
by this effect.
    The subject finds further, and perhaps clearer, elucidation in
the case of isomorphous crystals.             It is not, think, questioned                I
at  present,   that the    deportment     of  crystals  in the magnetic field
depends upon their molecular structure; nor will                        imagine,                    it,

parallel to the axis.       Here, as before, we arrive at a conclusion
which is controverted by experiment; for the repulsion of a
crystal of carbonate of lime is a maximum when the repelling
force acts along the axis of the crystal. Hence would infer    I
that the excitement of carbonate of iron cannot be the same as
that of carbonate of lime.

sealed hermetically in a combustion tube.    The two fluids mix
readily, but if the tube containing them be gently heated, by
plunging it for the space of half a minute into the water-bath,
an action takes place attended with the evolution of much heat,
the fluid becomes muddy, and separates into a thick oily stratum
which rises to the surface, and a more fluid one which descends.
On cooling, the former solidifies                     into   a   highly crystalline mass,
and well-formed crystals appear in the latter, which consists of
the excess of iodide of aethyle. Even without the application of
heat the action takes place, though more slowly, and it is neces
sary to have them in contact for some days before the action is
finished. When heat is applied, the action is complete in ten
minutes, but    in every instance the tubes were allowed to stand
for  twenty-four    hours, so as to present the complete crystalliza
tion of the new compound.          The tubes were then opened, the
whole contents thrown upon a filter, and the crystals slightly
washed with a mixture of alcohol and aether, pressed between
folds of filtering paper, and dissolved in the smallest possible
quantity of a mixture of boiling alcohol and aether.         On cooling,
the new substance is      deposited   in beautiful silvery plates.    It is
highly soluble in water, and though not deliquescent, it becomes
slightly damp in moist air.                 Its

of the four aethyle atoms which the complex base contained is
decomposed, and the other three remain with the ammonia in
the form of a nitryle base; in fact, we may fairly assume that
the atom of aethyle added to the triaethylamine to convert it into
tetraethylammonium     is decomposed, and the base which formed
the starting-point   of that action is regenerated.   With meth
aethylopicoline the case is different; we start, indeed, from a
nitryle base, but in place of reproducing it in the decomposition,
the atom of aethyle which has been added takes possession of
the ammonia, and produces an amide base, leaving the radicals,
which we must assume to have replaced the three atoms of
hydrogen in the ammonia from which the picoline was originally
produced, in some other form of combination.        In another point,
also, the decomposition    of  aethylopicoline differs from that of
tetraethylammonium.      According to Hofmann, the latter base is
entirelyconverted into triaethylamine andolefiant gas; but aethylo
picoline, even after long-continued boiling, gives an abundant
residue on evaporation. The substance so obtained is amorphous,
has an intense blood-red colour, and is a base forming a platinum
salt insoluble in water.   Although these experiments were made
on a very small scale, and the slowness of the action rendered it
impossible to say with certainty whether the decomposition was
complete, this platinum compound was analysed, and the results

  From a single analysis such as this it is impossible to deduce
aformula; but it is obvious that a base of much higher atomic
weight than aethylopicoline has been produced, the further ex
amination of which must be deferred to a future paper, and
which will probably lead to interesting results.

   AEthylopyridine itself may be separated from the salt by the
action of oxide of silver. It forms a highly alkaline fluid, which
undergoes decomposition when heated, with the evolution of a
base which is no doubt aethylamine, and agrees completely with
it in properties, though the small scale on which the experiment
was performed prevented my establishing this fact by analysis.
It unites with acids, and forms salts, which are    crystallizable,  all

226       On Gallic     Acid   as a Developing Agent in Photography.
overcome: he recommends the addition of a small proportion
of alcohol or acetic acid to the aqueous solution, which will so
arrest decomposition as to render it possible to keep in stock a
quantity of this reagent, as we should of any other stable prepa
ration.
   Having undertaken the arrangement of the department in
this Observatory in which photography is applied to the regis
tration of the various meteorological phaenomena, and having
for many reasons decided upon the use of the wax-paper pro
                                                      I
cess+ as that best adapted to the purpose, have naturally been
anxious to avail myself of any improvements which may tend to
diminish the labour or contribute to the general perfection of
the result.
   At first the solution of gallic acid for developing the latent
image was prepared in large quantities at a time, and preserved
from decomposition by the process just referred to; but the
amount of liquid necessary to be prepared at once, in order to
last any length of time, proved to be so bulky, that         was in  I
duced to try whether the method could not be so far modified
as to admit of the water being entirely left out of the stock so
lution, and only added as required for use. This led to the em
ployment of alcohol as a solvent for the gallic acid; and finding
that under these conditions the character of the latter as a de
veloping agent was greatly heightened,            I
                                            resolved to make a few
experiments on the subject, the result of which                  I
                                                          beg leave
to  communicate,   in the hope  that the  particulars will be found
useful to others similarly situated to myself.
   Two ounces of gallic acid are to be dissolved in 6 ounces of
alcohol (60° over proof); to hasten solution, the flask may be
conveniently heated by immersion in hot water; when cold, it
should be filtered, mixed with half a drachm of glacial acetic acid,
and preserved in a stoppered bottle for use; so prepared, it will
keep unaltered for a considerable length of time. The gallic
acid is not precipitated from this solution by the addition of
water; consequently, if in any case desirable, the development of
a picture may be effected with a much stronger bath than the
one usually employed.
   To obtain a solution of about the same strength as a saturated
aqueous solution, half a drachm of the above would require to
be added to 2 ounces of water; but for my particular purpose
I prefer a weaker bath, which is prepared by mixing half a
drachm with 10 ounces of water.          In either case it will be
found necessary to add solution of nitrate of silver in small
quantities as the developing picture seems to require                it.

INPhilosophical
       a note at the foot of page 250 of the 37th volume of the
                     Magazine, a question of interest both in a me
chanical and electrical point of view is suggested by the follow
ing statement of Prof. W. Thomson:—“The phanomenon of a
solid body,” writes Mr. Thomson, “hovering freely in the air,
in stable equilibrium, without any ea<U+017F>ternal support, has never,         I
am convinced, been witnessed as the result of any electrical or
magnetical experiment.”        An experiment described by Franklin,
and redescribed    by  Prof. Srtscaek of Pesthº, without any know
ledge of what Franklin had done previously, seems to furnish the
precise fact alluded to by Prof. Thomson.             If the knob of a
charged Leyden jar be caused to approach a number of scraps of
gold-leaf, the consequent jumping of the leaves is well known.
If  a certain shape be imparted to the gold-leaf, when the knob is
approached the leaf is attracted and moves towards the knob;
but, before it reaches the latter, it is arrested, and hovers in the
air, like a fish in water.      When the atmosphere is dry, the leaf
can be preserved swimming for hours together “without any
 external support or constraint.”
    The following description of the experiment by Prof. Srtsczek
is taken from Poggendorff’s Annalen, vol. lxxxviii. p. 493.
    Let a small Leyden jar which can be held conveniently in the
hand be charged with, say positive, electricity. Let the knob be
 gradually brought near to several bits of gold-leaf lying upon
 clean paper, from 6 to 12 lines in length, and from a line to a
 line and a half in width: they may be rectangular, lozenge
 shaped, trapezium-shaped or triangular.
    A jumping of the leaves immediately commences, but soon
 the remarkable fact will be witnessed that one or more of the
 scraps will suddenly halt in their movement, and remain freely
 floating in the air; sometimes rotating round the knob of the
jar, and showing a tendency to rotate round their own axes.
    The knob must reach several inches above the insulated rim
 of the jar, so that scraps which hover at a considerable distance
 may not be attracted by the rim. At the conductor of a ma
 chine the swimming of the gold-leaf is also seen at a much
 greater distance (a foot for example), but the experiment does
 not succeed so quickly.       The leaves must be smooth, and of an
 elongated shape.
    With the same strength of charge, portions of gold-leaf,
 equally long, but of different shapes, hover at different distances
 from the knob.                                                             -
    * And, we believe, exhibited in a modified form by Prof. Faraday in his

     With the same charge, and scraps tolerably alike in shape,
the long ones hover at greater distances than the short ones.
This is most plainly seen when the experimenter succeeds in
causing several scraps to swim at the same time.
   When the charge diminishes in intensity, the leaves slowly
approach the knob of the jar; when, however, by means of the
knob of a second jar, electricity is communicated to the former,
the leaves again recede. In this manner, when the air is dry, a
scrap of gold-leaf can be kept swimming for hours.
   In some cases the rotation first begins when the floating leaf
comes near to the jar, and the rotation is accelerated as the leaf
approaches.
   With scraps of a suitable shape, the equilibrium is so stable
that the upright jar may be suddenly pulled downwards, with
out altering the hovering condition of the scrap of gold-leaf.
   From the side of the leaf most distant from the jar electricity
is given off of the same name as that wherewith the jar is
charged; and it has the power of propagating itself to a consi
derable distance.  When a gold-leaf electroscope is placed near
the “fish,” a permanent divergence is observed after the instru
ment has been removed.
   When the swimming leaf is removed from the neighbourhood
of the knob, by suddenly withdrawing the jar, it is found that
those pieces which swim at about an inch distance are in a neu
tral condition ; while those which swim at a less distance are
negative.     Only such                    as,
                            while swimming, come very near the
knob      the jar, show sometimes positive electricity.

  This essay contains the greater part   series  observations             ofa                 of
made between 1845 and 1850. The following are some        the                                                   of
conclusions which they plainly indicate                              :-
    (1.) The respiratory movements               Dragon-flies (Libellulae), and,

               other insects    also,   are   naturally  subject      considerable            to
and   frequent   variations       force and in   rate,  the causes         many                         of           of
these variations    being     yet      as
                                    unknown.
    (2.) The respirations         these insects are always quickened by
                                            of
exercise, emotion, rise          temperature, galvanism, and mechanical
                                         of
irritation; and the last three agents quicken them                the decapitated,       in
 as well    as   in
                the  perfect,  insect.
    (3.) The respiratory movements              each segment   of   the trunk are,        of
           measure,   independent                          rest, although

the insect; but       diminishes their frequency and force, and deprives

them of all influence of the will and of mental emotions.

 the coordinate similar movements of all the segments, in proving
 their close mutual relations and mutual influence.

region beyond them, upon the Plumb-line in India.”                  By the Vene
rable John    Henry   Pratt,  M.A.,    Archdeacon of Calcutta.
   The author commences by observing that it is now well known
that the attraction of the Himalaya Mountains, and of the elevated
region beyond them, has a sensible influence on the plumb-line in
North India. This circumstance was brought to light during the
progress of the great trigonometrical survey of that country.                    It
was found by triangulation that the difference of latitude between
the two extreme stations of the northern division of the arc, namely
Kalianpur and Kaliana, is 5°23'42"-294, whereas astronomical ob
servations show a difference of 5°23' 37":058, which is 5'236 less
than the former.
   That the geodetic operations are not in fault, appears from this;
that two bases, about 7 miles long, at the extremities of the arc
having been measured with the utmost care, and also the length of
the northern base having been computed from the measured length
of the southern one, through a chain of triangles extending about
370 miles, the difference between the measured and the computed
lengths was only 0:6 of a foot, which would produce, even if wholly
lying in the meridian, a difference of only 0":006 in the latitude.
   The difference 5", 236 must therefore be attributed to some other
cause. A very probable cause presents itself in the attraction of the
superficial matter which lies in such abundance on the north of the
Indian arc. It is easily seen that this disturbing force acts in the
right direction, that                 is,
                                diminishes the difference

defect in the amplitude of the latter would diminish the value of the
ellipticity resulting from the two by about the #th part of the
whole. If the effect of mountain attraction be as great as the author
calculates it to be, (15".885 in the northern portion of the Indian
arc,) the ellipticity would be diminished by                                        ; s, and even by as much

outline of the continent of Asia. On this was laid down a polygonal
figure DEFGHIJKL, (which for convenience the author calls the
“enclosed space,”) marking the boundary of an irregular mass,
which is the only part of the earth's surface that appears to have a
sensible effect on the plumb-line in India. The boundary of this
space is thus defined           :-
    DEF is the Himalaya range, having a bend at E from north-west
on the left, to east-by-south on the right. FG is a range running to
the table-land of Yu-man in lat. 25° and long. 103°. GH is the
range of the Yun-Ling mountains, in which there are many peaks of
perpetual snow.       HI is the Inshan range.                               IJ

range, very steep on the east side, not so on the west; the passes
are said to be 5525 feet above the sea.                             JK
                                                       is the Altai range, the
highest peak of which is 10,800 feet; the average height is 6000: the
range declines towards the east.            KL was once thought to be a
range of mountains, but is now found to be a line of broken country.
LD is the Bolor range, rising to an elevation similar to that of the
Hindoo Koosh. There are besides these two ranges of mountains
running into the enclosed space, parallel to the Altai and Southern
Himalayas, namely the Thian-Schan range, or Celestial Mountains,
and the Kuen-Luen range, being a continuation of the Hindoo Koosh,
which rises from an altitude of 2558 feet near Herat to about 20,000
where it meets the Bolor range.           It                 is,
                                                 however, with the elevation

    Before describing the country within these limits, the author gives
a  general sketch         the parts which

   The first of  these differences is considerably greater than                5"236,
the quantity brought to light by the Indian Survey.
   The author then examines these values more minutely, and con
siders the effect of various hypotheses for reducing them.
   In the first place, the density of the attracting mass may have been
assumed too large.          The density assumed is 2:75 that of distilled
water, the value assumed as the mean density of the mountain
Schehallien in the calculations of Maskelyne. This can hardly be too
great, but at any rate no remarkable supposition relative to the density
can reduce the attraction by more than a small fraction of the whole.
   Next, the mass of the doubtful region may have been assumed
too great. This hypothesis is then examined by the author, who
concludes that even the extravagant supposition of the non-exist
ence of that region will not reduce the difference of meridian de
flexions at A and B lower than to 9":753.
   A third means of reduction may be looked for in the known region.
A large part of the attraction belonging to this region arises from

the Great Plateau.     It would be necessary to cut down this plateau
as much as 6000 feet to reduce the deflexions at A and B to 5'''236,
even were the whole mass on the doubtful region non-existent; so
that it appears to be quite hopeless, by any admissible hypothesis
relative to heights, densities, &c., to reduce the calculated deflexion
so as to make it tally with the error brought to light by the survey.
   After entering into some elaborate calculations confirmatory of
the previous results, the author concludes by calculating the form of
the Indian arc, that         is,
                        by determining what spheroid        revolution,-                      of
the axis     revolution being the earth's axis, would most nearly

                    or
                    at

from the Indian    arc alone #3, nearly agreeing with ##, which                                                    is

nous coal in the lower part of the Lancashire coal-field.    The no
dules were of various sizes, some weighing many pounds, and caused
the coal to bulge out both above and below them, and they were
found to be entirely composed of vegetable tissues converted into
carbonate of lime and magnesia. Their formation is supposed by
the authors to be due to infiltration of water through the superin
cumbent shales, which were full of fossil shells supposed to be of
marine origin, and the aggregation of the mineral matter round
centres of vegetable remains.     The chemical constituents of the
nodules were found to be carbonates of lime and magnesia, sesqui
oxide and sulphate of iron, with a little carbonaceous matter.
  The probability of these nodules representing an average sample
of the vegetable constituents of the surrounding coal is then dis
cussed, and attention is drawn to the very great interest and import
ance that would attach to them were such a view substantiated, as
showing the exact nature of the association of plants which is
capable of conversion into bituminous coal.
    All the plants contained in the nodules were common in other
parts of the coal formation, viz. Calamodendron, Halonia, Sigillaria,
Lepidodendron, Stigmaria, Trigonocarpon, Anabothra, and others; of
these the first-named genus occurred in the greatest abundance and
as large fragments of fossil wood,        Very many of the specimens
were sliced, and being reduced to very thin transparent sections,
were examined with the view of determining the botanical character
of their contents, and the intimate structure of the masses of more or
less homogeneous aspect to which they were reduced by decompo
sition, previous to or during the operation of calcification.      The re
sults were very satisfactory, and seemed to indicate that         traces   all   of
vegetable structure may        completely obliterated

reasons;    mainly, however, from the fact, that organic impurities
when diffused through a vast body of moving water, whether fresh
or salt, become altogether, and very rapidly lost; so much so, indeed,
as apparently to have called forth a special agency to arrest the
total annihilation of organized matter in its final oscillation between
 the organic and inorganic worlds. The author alluded to the count
 less hosts of microscopic creatures which swarm in most waters,
 and whose principal function has been ably surmised by the great
 anatomist, Professor Owen, to be that of feeding upon, and thus
 restoring to the living chain, the almost unorganized matter diffused
 through their various zones of habitation.             These creatures preying
 upon one another, and being preyed upon by others in their turn,
 the circulation of organic matter is kept up, and carried through                                                               its

are the lines that would be traced by   placing   the centre of gra
vity of a very small steel needle, perfectly free to turn about this
point, in any position in their neighbourhood, and then carrying
it always in the direction pointed by the magnetic axis of the
needle.
   Remark. Except in the cases of symmetrical magnets, the
lines of force will generally be lines of double curvature, and no
set of them will              lie   in   one plane.

dently also pectolite; it is included in mineralogical works under
the head of table spar, but containing soda, it must be pectolite,
which differs from table spar merely in silicate of soda replacing
silicate of lime.    Walker's mineral then in              probability             all                    is
identical with the mineral discovered            Lord Greenock; we are   by

                  to           Thomson, pectolite has occurred

      Dr. Heddle and Mr. R. P. Greg on British Pectolites.               251
from the Morne Mountains, said to be this mineral, have by our
own analysis proved to be table spar, and consequently the only
locality we have as yet of this mineral in the British Islands.
    Frankenheim argues that pectolite is anhydrous, chiefly because
 he wishes to prove it to be a hornblende.       This is quite inadmis
 sible; from not one locality has it been found anhydrous, and
 the per-centages from the different localities do not vary much,
 averaging about 3 per cent. ; and although the proportion of
 water does vary half a per cent. when the powdered mineral
 has been dried at 212°, yet when this necessary precaution
 has been taken, the proportion is in each specimen invari
 ably the same; any previous variation must therefore have been
 due to hygrometric moisture.           In addition to this, we find
 the mineral to be very        slightly  absorbent; that from Ratho
 absorbs 53 per cent. of moisture, that from the Castle Rock
  ‘29 per cent., and that from Ayrshire ‘35 per cent. ; again, it
 parts with the water it does contain only after the most intense
 heating.     The Castle Rock mineral, after about ten minutes'
  exposure to a red heat, gave only l'? per cent. of water; a loss
 in the analysis led us to redetermine the water, when, after
  exposing the mineral to a heat approaching to whiteness for thirty
 minutes, we got 3:13 per cent.         Seeing, then, that the mineral
 in powder is almost non-absorbent, and that it retains the water
 it does contain with such tenacity, it appears to us to be an ex
 traordinary conclusion to arrive at to say that water is unessen
 tial; and to exclude a constantly present constituent merely to
  suit a theory, is absurd.
     There is a difference of opinion with regard to the formula of
 this mineral, and by    place   inthe system.    Dr. Scott rejects the
 formula    given    its
                       Berzelius,  and  prefers one    his own, which
                                                            of
 agrees admirably with his analysis; but          the quantity
                                                       as           of
                                                                  water
 as  therein stated is  much greater than elsewhere found, his for
 mula   of course does not suit the analyses           of
                                                   others.
    Frankenheim also       rejects   Berzelius’s  formula,   and offers
                       -

be induced to put forth such explanations, acknowledgements,
or conclusions, as the state of the subject may then seem to
render necessary or useful.
   In the mean time, the more we can enlarge the number of
anomalous facts and consequences the better it will be for the
subject; for they can only remain anomalous to us whilst we
continue in error. I may say, however, that the idea you sug
gest presents no difficulty to me; for having on former occasions
(Exp. Res. 2501.) had to consider the magnecrystallic phaeno
mena presented by the same body in different media, and having
found the magnecrystallic difference unchanged in the media,                                                     I
have no difficulty in conceiving that a body (as bismuth), which
in the amorphous state is of the same magnetic character as the
medium around              it,

vancing no principle,             I
                           say, that the hypothetical fundamental
ideas  already advanced,   when taken in relation to the body of
facts now   known,   are  self-contradictory and inapplicable. The
following points, namely,–that the direction and polarity of
lines of magnetic force are always shown truly by the electric cur
rent induced in metal moving within their influence;—that the
dualities of electricity and magnetism are always respectively and
essentially related;—that the dualities of an isolated magnet are
not related back in straight lines through the magnet;-are to
my mind not hypothetical in character, but easily proveable by
experiment:—and they, with the considerations arising from the
principle of the conservation of force, seem to me to be left un
explained by, and in opposition                  to,
                                      the usual hypotheses.   No
difference arises about the laws                  of
                                         magnetic action and their
mathematical     development;   and  that, simply because they are
as  yet applied only partially, and thus far are   accordance within
all the views taken, including mine. When the attempt made                           is
to  apply them         soinclude
                            as   to once paramagnetic, diamagnetic,

large and yet precise             as
                               enable  to          us

subject     toexperiment and tangible       facts.     by
    Some persons may feel surprised that            dwell upon points

            these and such like phaenomena acquire new character       a

 On the Benzole Series.—Determination                of Boiling-points.                257
been accurately  tested, the errors being known up to 200° C.
Into a small retort of symmetrical shape was introduced a coil of
platinum wire, and about 100 grammes of toluole repeatedly
purified with sodium.       Before a perfectly trustworthy result
could be arrived at, there were several precautions to be taken.
An allowance had to be ascertained and made for irregularities
introduced by the partial immersion of the thermometer-stem in
the vapour; and it was found that when the spheroids which
form upon the surface of the liquid touch the bulb of the ther
mometer (immersed in the vapour), they cause variations in the
height of the mercury, thus interfering with the constancy of the
boiling-point.    Remembering these things, and taking care to
place the bulb of the retort in a chloride of calcium bath, I
observed the boiling-point of purified toluole, the bulb of the
thermometer just touching the surface of the liquid.      The tem
perature of the liquid rose gradually to 97° C.; from this point
to 103° the rise was rapid. Between 103° and 104° eight-tenths
 of the toluole distilled over; and on redistillation, the boiling
 point remained constant at 103°6, the barometric pressure being
 0n 757. With toluole (purified by sodium) prepared from
 toluylic acid, exactly the same phaenomena were observed.
    Having now given the more important details of my procedure
 for the preparation, &c. of pure toluole,               I
                                              may mention that                            I
subjected benzole  (from benzoic acid) to the same treatment:
the boiling-point of benzole thus obtained, and that (from coal
tar) purified by repeated crystallizations,                  is,
                                             however, identical.
Of the xylole (obtained from coal-naphtha and wood-spirit),                             I
collected for experiment   that which came over         about 128°.     at
After  purification with potash, sulphuric acid, solution    chromic         of
acid, and with caustic baryta and sodium, the boiling-point was
but slightly reduced.    The cumole (from cuminic acid and coal
naphtha) was purified       the same way,
                              in                         as

 details and numerical results of these analyses, and of many
 others which the present inquiry necessitated, the limits and
 special object of the present paper do not admit of my giving

 a method which suggested itself to me when working upon the
 corresponding term of the benzole series; by it             I
                                                    have obtained
 nitrosulphoxylolic and -cumolic acids.   As benzole with fuming

                                             imagined that nitro
 benzole would yield, when similarly treated, nitrosulphobenzolic
 acid; and this supposition experiment proved to be correct.    It
 is not possible to obtain in this way sulphocymolic acid, for the

 fuming nitric acid. The salts of these nitrosulpho-acids defla
 grate when heated; in the case of the barium compounds, the
 residual sulphate of baryta assuming the form of long, narrow
 ribands.
    Bases prepared from impure hydrocarbons of the benzole
 series give, on analysis, results tolerably accordant with theory:
 this circumstance, if not entirely accounted for by the numerous
 processes of purification which these bases undergo, is explained
 when we recollect the recent researches of C. G. Williams’k
‘On the Fractional Crystallization of Platinum Saltsf.”
    Many subjects for further investigation have suggested them
 selves to me during the progress of the present inquiry; among
 these the subject of isomers is of great interest.    The important
 observations, too, of  Regnault   and others as to the alterations in
 their boiling-points which many liquids undergo when heated
 under pressure,    Ihave found to refer to benzole, &c.; on this
 account, in  purifying  these liquids, I was obliged to desist from
 digesting them in sealed tubes.         A digestion of toluole with
 sodium in a closed vessel for a fortnight causes the elimina
tion of two bodies, the boiling-point (97°) of one being interme
diate between that of benzole and toluole, the boiling-point of
the second (112°) being between those of toluole and xylole.
And    I have lately found, that among the products of the distil
lation of eugenic acid with an excess of baryta, a liquid occurs
 for which my experiments (not made with          perfectly pure sub
                                                   a

It  boils at about 142°.       It would seem, therefore, that there are
three bodies     having    the formula C*H*; cumole boiling at
148°4, mesitilole boiling at 155°, and the hydrocarbon from
eugenic acid boiling at 142°.         May not these            and those
obtained from     toluole,  stand in similar relations to one another ?
The same differences between their boiling-points are observable.
I  am still investigating this question with reference to the other
members of the benzole series, and endeavouring by the differ
ences of specific gravity, vapour density, refractive power, &c.
of these liquids, to discover their true relations to one another.
    By referring to the table given before, it will be found that,
according to my experiments, the increment in the boiling-point
in the benzole series for an addition of C*H* varies between
22°9 and 22°2. By determining the boiling-points of the con
secutive members of several series, in which not only carbon and
hydrogen enter, but also oxygen and nitrogen, we shall be able
to learn whether such formulaek as those of Schröder will prove
to any extent generally applicable.         The substances in such ex
periments must of course be absolutely pure. The present con
tribution, having reference to a simple series containing only
carbon and hydrogen, may be considered introductory. Schröder
remarks, that between those boiling-points which are theoreti
cally determinable from his formulae and those experimentally
observed, a difference of +7°2, it 14°4 may be found.              Since
the remarks upon the isomers of cumole and toluole were written,
I  have noticed the close approximation of the differences between
the boiling-points of these isomers to this difference of 7°2.

XL.    On a New Single Fluid Galvanic Battery, more powerful,
    and  less expensive in construction and use, than any of the Nitric

                1854, I stated that sheet iron coated with an alloy
of lead and tin, in which the quantity of lead is five or six times
as great as that of tin, and afterwards platinized, might be sub
stituted with advantage for the platinized silver used in Smee's
battery.      Being under a necessity of exhibiting occasionally
during the academical year, optical experiments which required
a very strong light,     I  was very anxious to have a galvanic bat
               * Not, however, based on arbitrary numbers.

                                 Fluid Galvanic Battery.                                                    261
tery in which there would be no need of porous cells or nitric
acid, and which, with a moderate number of plates, would pro
duce a brilliant coke light or lime light. From experiments made
with our large galvanometer on the voltaic power of a pair of
zinc and platinized coated iron plates excited by dilute sulphuric
acid, I inferred that a battery containing a hundred, or one
hundred and fifty such plates, would produce the light which                                                     I
required. Having more than twenty Wedgwood troughs, each
containing ten cells, I saw that the cost of such a battery would
be very moderate:                I
                          therefore resolved to make one of 200 pairs
of plates. Whilst the battery was being made, I occasionally
tried the power of one trough or ten cells.                first used a solu        I
tion of  sulphuric   acid  consisting    of one   part of strong acid and
about seven of water.                       I
                                  then tried one     part   of the same acid
mixed with about six times             bulk      itspretty strong solution
                                                                  of     a
of                                         the salt produced
                                                       of I of
    common salt.      The addition                                   consider
able increase             of
                     voltaic  power.         next employed            exciting                    an a
mixture consisting          one part
                                 of          nitric, six       sulphuric acid,          of
 and about fifty           of
                      water.      With this mixture, ten pairs          plates,                        of
each about      inches
                 6       square,   ignited     pair      coke-points,

gave  a  small but brilliant star        light.     But the nitric acid gra

                                                 of
plates were coated, and the platina powder fell off.                then tried                I
 one part    of
              nitric acid, twelve        sulphuric, and about
                                                      of              hundred
of  water.   This mixture also acted               the coating      onthe iron                     of a
 plates.   I was therefore obliged           give     up, and
                                                            to      returnit                      to         to

covered with     deposit

262              The Rev. Prof. Callan on a New Single
wanted, by exciting zinc and cast iron with dilute sulphuric
acid.                                                                                           -
   During the evening of the day on which I tried the cast iron cell
excited with dilute sulphuric acid, it struck me that, on having
increased the strength of the acid solution by pouring a little
acid into the cell, a strong impulse was given to the needle of
the galvanometer, and that perhaps, by increasing very much
                                      I
the strength of the solution, might get a very powerful galvanic
 current.   I then resolved to try concentrated sulphuric acid and
 dilute acid of the various degrees of strength between concen
 trated acid and one part of acid mixed with eight of water.
    The sulphuric acid which I used was very strong and pure,
being made, not from pyrites, but from sulphur.           In comparing
the   galvanic  powers    of the various batteries which         tried, I     I
always used our large galvanometer, and sent the voltaic current
 only through the outermost coil, the diameter of which is about
25 inches.     The coil is made of copper wire ºths of an inch
thick. The outside coil is nearly 7 feet long. The galvano
meter may be used as a sine or tangent galvanometer.
     Ibegan by exciting the cast-iron cell and zinc plate with con
centrated sulphuric acid : the galvanic current produced was
exceedingly feeble.        I
                          then mixed a small quantity of water with
the acid : the deflection of the needle was greatly increased. Icon
tinued to pour water gradually into the cast-iron cell, and found
that the deflection of the needle increased until the acid was diluted
to a certain degree, and that when it was diluted still further,
the deflection was diminished, and became constantly less as the
quantity of water was increased.       After five or six hours spent
in frequently charging the cell with dilute sulphuric acid of
various degrees of strength, I found that the acid which            used,         I
diluted with twice      its
                         bulk       of
                                  water, produced  the most    powerful
galvanic current; and that when the acid was diluted with more
or  less than twice     its
                         bulk       of
                                 water, the voltaic power        the cell    of
was diminished.        Iafterwards found that acid which was still
stronger than the very strong acid which first used, and which
                                                     I
was also made from sulphur, and not from pyrites, required                            to   be

                    galvanic
                   of          power,        produce     current equal
                                                  byto

                                                           the first acid
diluted with twice its bulk         of
                                  water.   Either                  of
                                                       the two diluted
acids which I  have described act very little                 on
                                                 amalgamated zinc.
I am inclined     think that the common sulphuric acid, which
                  to
isgenerally made from pyrites, and    not  is pure    that which
                                                         so             as                 is

                                    that which first used, should

             The Rev. Prof. Callan   on a   New Single
with the opposite ends of the coil of the galvanometer, in such a
way, that, as soon as the two cells should be filled, the galvanic
currents from them would flow simultaneously through the coil
in opposite directions.    The cell of the nitric acid battery was
first filled : it was in the best working order, and produced a
steady deflection of 82°.     The other cell was then filled with one
part of sulphuric acid and two of water, and the voltaic currents
from the two cells flowed simultaneously through the coil in
opposite directions.     The current from the cell excited by dilute
sulphuric acid destroyed the entire deflection produced by the
nitric acid cell, and produced an opposite and steady deflection
of 72°.    On another occasion I made a similar experiment with
a nitric acid cell and one of the same size, in which the distance
between the zinc and cast iron was about the ºth of an inch,
and which was excited with one of the fluids already described.
In this experiment the sine galvanometer was used, and the
compass-box      containing the magnetic needle was slid 21;
inches from the centre of the coil in the direction of its axis.
The voltaic current was first sent through the coil from the nitric
acid cell, and a deviation of 38° was produced. The single fluid cell
was then filled, and the galvanic currents flowed simultaneously
from the two cells in opposite directions through the coil. The
current from the single fluid cell destroyed the entire deviation
of 38°, and produced a deviation of 42° on the opposite side of
the magnetic meridian, thus showing that its power was more
than twice as great as that of the current produced by the nitric
acid cell.   The porous cell employed in this experiment was of
the best quality; it was perfectly saturated on the outside with
nitro-sulphuric acid, and on the inside with dilute sulphuric acid,
consisting of one part of very strong and pure sulphuric acid
and five of water.
   From the experiments and results which have been described,
it is evident that a single fluid battery more powerful than any
nitric acid battery of the same size, may be made by exciting
a suitable arrangement of cast-iron cells or plates and amalga
mated zinc with any of the following fluids.         First, undiluted
muriatic   acid,   or muriatic acid diluted with a small quantity of
water; secondly, muriatic and sulphuric acid together diluted
with a quantity of water a little more than twice as great by
measure as that of the sulphuric acid; thirdly, sulphuric acid
diluted with about twice   its  bulkof        or
                                         water,    the strongest sul
phuric acid made from sulphur diluted with three times        itsbulk
of  water; fourthly, sulphuric acid mixed with three times its
bulk   of
        a  strong solution of   common salt,  or  the strongest sul
                                                           be 3}
phuric acid made from sulphur mixed with about                  times
 its  bulk  of   the same solution.     The solution may        made

                             Fluid Galvanie Battery.                                             265
by dissolving nearly two pounds of salt in                                   each      gallon of
Water.
   It will be very useful to dissolve some carbonate or sulphate
of soda in each of these exciting fluids, except the last. I recom
mend the last in preference to any of the others: first, because
it is the cheapest of all; secondly, because I think the amalga
mated surface of the zinc is better preserved, and kept cleaner
by the last than by any of the others; thirdly, because it appears
to act less on amalgamated zinc than any of the others.
   A very powerful battery may be made by exciting amalga
mated zinc, and iron, copper, platina, or a platinized metal with
any of these fluids.      But they produce the greatest galvanic
power when cast iron is the negative element.
   Muriatic acid preserves the amalgam on the zinc, but it soon
covers it with a dark scum, which I fear would, after some time,
diminish the action of the battery. Besides, it acts more than
dilute sulphuric acid on amalgamated zinc.         One would expect
that sulphuric acid mixed with a solution of common salt would
have the same effect as muriatic acid on the zinc ; but such is
not the case.

   On account of       powerful galvanic action,      cast-iron battery  a

266            The Rev. Prof. Callan on a New Single
exciting fluid, and when the battery is intended not for constant
work, but for experiments which may be occasionally interrupted,
to make provision for taking the metallic plates out of the exci
ting fluid whenever it may be necessary to suspend the expe
riments.
  . First, the greater the proximity of the metallic elements, the
more powerful will be the galvanic action, provided the hydrogen
escapes with sufficient freedom to allow the exciting fluid to be
in continual contact with the metals.      If the hydrogen prevents
the continual contact of the exciting fluid and metals, there will
be a series of voltaic currents instead of one constant uniform
current.     I have found that when the zinc plate is not more than
4 inches square, the hydrogen does not interfere with the constant
action of the battery, even though the distance between the zinc
and cast iron should not exceed the ºth of an inch.           Even in
that case a perfectly steady deflection of the magnetic needle is
produced by the battery, and therefore the voltaic current must
be constant and steady.      I  have not yet tried plates larger than
                        I
4 inches square, but am inclined to think that plates a foot
square or more need not be more than Tºth of an inch asunder.
    Secondly, the part of the cast iron which has little or no effect
in producing the voltaic current, must be protected against the
action of the exciting fluid.     Each of the exciting fluids that
have been described acts a good deal on cast iron; and were the
inactive part of the iron unprotected, there would be a consider
able and useless consumption of cast iron, and of the strength
of the exciting fluid. The iron may be sufficiently protected by
covering it with vulcanized india-rubber, wood, or any other sub
stance on which the exciting fluid acts but little or not at all.
    The cast iron may have the form of cells which hold the ex
citing fluid, or of plates, each pair being connected together at
the top, but separated from each other elsewhere so as to admit a
zinc plate between them.       The distance between each cast-iron
plate and the one connected with it at the top may be a quarter
or a fifth of an inch, so that a zinc plate an eighth of an inch
thick may be put between the two, and that each side of the
zinc will be a sixteenth or twentieth of an inch from the cast
iron.     The contact between the zinc and cast iron may be pre
vented by a thin wedge of wood at each corner of the plate.         If
 cast-iron cells be used, they must be an inch or an inch and a half
higher than the zinc plates. The width of the part of the cell which
 contains the zinc plate should not exceed one-fourth of an inch,
 otherwise the distance between the zinc and cast iron will be too
 great, and there will be a loss of galvanic power.      The part of
 the cast-iron cell which is near the top or above the zinc plate
 should be about 1% inch wide, in order to hold a sufficient

With the nitric acid battery, the positive point         much more                         is
intensely ignited, and gives out       far greater  quantity a   light                                 of

   At least one-third      the powerof    the battery just described

whilst it is coated with nitrate of iron, is considerably less than
one-half that of the current produced by the same cell excited
by the same fluid after the nitrate of iron has been removed. It
is necessary to clean the cast-iron cells or plates before they are
used, by leaving them for some time in dilute sulphuric or mu
riatic acid.
                                                   I
   In the beginning of September showed in the College a bat
tery of 182 cast-iron cells excited by one part of sulphuric acid
and three of a strong solution of common salt.      The experiments
made with this   battery consisted in the  ignition   of coke-points
and of various metals.   A scientific friend who came from Dub
lin to be present at the experiments, who had great experience
of the working of nitric acid batteries, and witnessed in the Col
lege the action of 275 4-inch cells of the nitric acid battery on
one occasion, and of 200 cells on another, stated that the 182
 cells of the single fluid battery appeared to him to be superior in
 power to the 275 or the 200 nitric acid cells.            On this occasion
I   requested several persons to compare the degree of ignition
 and illumination of the negative and positive coke-points. In
 order to be able to look steadily at the ignited points, they
 used deeply-coloured glasses.          They           all
                                                   stated that they could
 not   perceive  any  difference between the     degree      ignition
                                                                   of      one       of
 point and the other. When the connexion with the battery was
 broken, both points appeared equally heated, and equally                                    or
 nearly equally consumed.

were connected with a pair of coke-points.   The voltaic current
passed through the two empty cells, ignited the coke-points, and
produced a brilliant light. The voltaic current had no other
means of passing to the coke than through the damp pieces of
wood which separated the zinc plates from the cast-iron cells, or
through the wooden frames in which the two empty cells were
placed.
   The Rev. Dr. Robinson and Mr. Rergin, to whom              men                  I
tioned the various fluids which I found to excite cast iron and
zinc so powerfully, have lately tried a cast-iron battery of 48
cells, charged with one part of strong sulphuric acid and three of
a pretty strong solution of common salt.      The distance between
the zinc and iron was nearly #th of an inch. The quantity of
fluid used in filling the battery was,                 I
                                            think, a gallon and a
half, in which there were about three pints, or about seven
or eight pounds of sulphuric acid.       With this battery they
had a brilliant coke light sufficiently steady to enable them
to make observations on the light with the prism and polari
scope; also lights produced by the ignition of various me
tallic points, on which lights similar observations were made.
Various other experiments were made; they commenced at one
o'clock, and were not given up till nine. There were of course
several interruptions, during each of which the fluid was, by a
very ingenious contrivance, poured off the metallic plates. During
the eight hours the experiments lasted, the battery was in con
stant action at least three and a half or four hours. At the end
of the experiments the two metals were quite clean, and there was
no sensible diminution of voltaic power. Such is the substance
                               I
of the account which received of the action of this battery.        The
results of this trial of the battery show that a cast-iron battery,
excited by one part of sulphuric acid and three of a solution of
common salt, is very powerful, extremely constant in             action,      its
and most occonomical        use.  The sulphuric acid employed was
                                   in

  ignited was constantly passing through the coil of the galvano
  meter.   I forgot to observe the deflection produced by the voltaic
   current during the combustion of the metals; but during the
   ignition of the coke-points, the deflection was frequently
   observed: the average deflection did not exceed 40°.          have                               I
   since found that the current from a single pair of plates, each an
  inch and a half square, produces a deflection of 58°, which
   requires a current about twice as powerful as one which would
  cause a deflection of 40°. Hence not more than about the Tºth of
  the power of the 70 4-inch cells was employed in producing the
  coke light. Fifteen-sixteenths of their power was inactive, whilst
  the exciting fluid was acting on the metals, and wasting        own                               its

            various groups, founded
                                                 in     divided

tion and optical properties.
   Chemically considered, they are divided     Rammelsberg and             by
others into three families:—

                          1. Potash mica.
                          2. Lithia mica.
                          3. Magnesia mica.
   Optically considered, they are divided into three groups also:—
       1. Biaxial micas, the angle between the optic axes being
            from 44° to 75°.
       2. Biaxial micas, with angle between optic axes from 5°
            to 20°.
       3. Biaxial and uniaxial micas, with angle   -
                                                         between optic
            axes from 5° to 0°.
   The first optical group includes the potash and lithia micas of
the chemical division, while the third chemical group, or mag
nesia mica, is divided between the second and third optical
groups, the second group being usually designated phlogopite,
and the third Biotite.
    The potash and lithia micas are considered by Rammelsberg
as represented by the following general formula,
                    m(RO, SiO4)4-n(R3 0°, SiO2);
in which formula, in the potash micas,
                             n=1,
                              n=2, 3, or 4;          -
the last two     cases,  n=3 and    n=4,    being    the   muscovite   of
mineralogists; and the first, n=2, or
                 RO, SiO3+2(R*0°, SiO3)+kHO,
being known as margarodite.
    The micas of the Dublin, Wicklow, and Carlow granites, ana
lysed by me, belong to the margarodite genus, and contain two
 atoms of water, corresponding to k=2.
    The following are the analyses of three micas selected from
three distant localities of the granite chain of the south-east of
 Ireland.                                                        -

   There can      little doubt, from the foregoing analyses, that
                        be
the transparent, gray   mica                     of
                               the district under consideration                                   is
a margarodite, having the rational formula
                        RO, SiO3+2(R*Oº, SiO2)+2HO.
    The mica which deviates most from this formula                                  is   the mica

  the   Mica of the Dublin, Wicklow, and Carlow Granites.                    275
of the Three Rock Mountain, and this deviation may possibly be
due to the presence of grains of black mica, which also occurs in
the mass of the granite, and of which I was unable to obtain a
sufficient quantity for chemical or optical examination.     The
quantity of protoxides in the Three Rock mica is somewhat in
excess of that required by the formula.                           -
   The angles between the optic axes of these micas were care
fully determined, and found to be as follows:—

  I  have added to the determination of angles of the micas
analysed, the optic angles of two other specimens of gray,
transparent mica from Lough             Dan and Glenmalure, county
Wicklow.                     -
   The four micas which were free from any intermixture of
black mica have a high angle, while the angle between the optic
axes of the mica from the Three Rock Mountain, which con
tained flakes of black mica, is nearly 20° less than that of the
pure transparent gray micas.
   The uniformity of the preceding analyses is sufficient to show
that margarodite is entitled to be considered as a distinct species
of hydrated mica, and that it is not merely an altered form of
muscovite, an opinion advocated by M. Dana in the last edition
of his ‘System of Mineralogy.’
   Crystallographically considered, the micas just described are
trimetric, and occur in flat, right rhombic prisms, with angles of
 6° and 120°; or in hexagonal tabular prisms, formed by the
replacement of the acute angles of the rhombic prisms,            the    all

            IN the
                applying to associative quines the general theory of
                   Third Section*, we may (as has been seen) omit
each of the signs X as unnecessary, the index h receiving only
one value in the sum thereby indicated; and may suppress each
sum X" as vanishing.     In this manner the type IV., or the
formula (151), becomes,
            IV.   .         (eqf)(eff--egg)=geh. ehf, .                      .     .    .     (191)
while the equation (127), already derived as a sub-type from                                       II.,
gives, by interchanging e and f,
                      (egf)(fee-Hºfgg)       = (geh) (hee-H h99).            .     .    .     (192)
Multiplying the latter of these two equations by eff-Hegg, and
the former by fee--fgg, and subtracting, we eliminate the symbol
(egf), and find that
     (geh){(ehf)(fee--fgg)–(eff--egg)                     (hee   +hgg)}=0;              .     (193)
and   a   similar elimination of (geh) gives the equation,
     (eqf){(ehf)(fee--fgg)–(eff--egg)(hee-H hyg)}=0.                                    .     (194)
And because (geh)=–(egh), by (34), we may make any sepa
rate or combined interchanges, of e with g, and off with h, and
so vary the expression within the { }, without introducing any
new factor, distinct from (egf) and (egh), outside them.  then,                             If,

 we   must have,         for   that arrangement           of   the indices,        a   system          of

It might seem that twelve equations between the twelve symbols

A similar  analysis may be applied to effect the elimination of the
fourth  pair of ratios (238), with results entirely analogous.   On
the whole then it is found, that the four equations (242) express
such connexions between the four pairs of ratios (238), as to
satisfy not only the two remaining equations, (245) and (246),
of their own groups,      and (f), but also the six other equations

We may indeed vary in many ways, consistently with the same
general theory, and by the assistance of the other recent types VI.

are to be satisfied, and the choice of the eight constants which
are to be regarded as still remaining arbitrary and undetermined:
and it may not be useless, nor uninteresting, to make some
remarks hereafter, upon the subject of such selections.      But in
the mean time it appears to be important to observe, that if
some of the recent results, especially the formulae (210), (228),
be combined with some of those previously obtained, and more
particularly with the equations (112), (121), of Section III., the

substance by which it lessens the magnetizability of the space

power of a paramagnetic substance.
    By the bye, a long time ago (rather more than a year after
the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association) I repeated
with much pleasure some of your compression experiments, and
found a piece of fresh bread instantly affected by pressure, so as
always to turn the compressed line perpendicular to the lines of
force, to whatever form the fragment was reduced.             A very slight
squeeze between the fingers was quite enough to produce this
property, or again to alter it so as to make a new line of com
pression set equatorially.        I repeated it a few days ago with the
same    results,  and   got a ball of bismuth, too, to act similarly.                                                   I
remember formerly finding the bread attracted as a whole, instead

however, this must have resulted from some ferruginous impu

stated,      I
          hope intelligibly.  The experiments on the paramag

phaenomena, illustrative of the resultant effects due to the attrac

 intensity of the field, and to the couples they experience when
 their axes are diverted from parallelism to the lines of force - by
mutual influence of the magnetized parts.

heat, by acids and alkalies, and by several other chemical and medi
cinal substances, until the possibility of provoking contraction by the
touch of a needle has been destroyed by the action of the agent—
until, that is to say, the “irritability” of the nerve has been de
stroyed by this action (Eckardt); and (4) because the influence of
the nervous centre in causing contraction is to suspend the natural
electricity of the nerve and muscle.     This last conclusion is evident
in the fact, that the signs of electricity, which are absent during
tetanus, immediately reappear in the muscle and in the portion of

   (e.) That heat and cold do not stimulate contraction, because con
traction does not happen until the natural polar action of the muscle is
suspended,—an event which happens equally under either extreme of
temperature,    and thus the muscle would seem to contract because
the heat or cold extinguishes that polar action - of the muscle which
antagonizes contraction.
        (f)
         That light cannot cause contraction, (1) because it exercises
a directly opposite influence upon the irritable cushions of the sensi
tive plant; and (2) because it is as easy to agree with Bichât, and
suppose that light expands the curtain of the iris, as that it causes
contraction in sphincter-fibres surrounding the pupil, which fibres
have no existence.
   (g.) That chemical and mechanical agencies do not stimulate con
traction, because contraction does not happen until the agent has de
stroyed that polar action of the muscle which antagonizes contrac
tion (Eckardt).
   It is argued, also, that the action of the will upon muscle is not
necessarily that of a stimulus, for the will may act by withdrawing
something from the muscle as well as by communicating something
to the muscle, and, if so, then the previous considerations enhance
the probability that it acts by withdrawing something.
   In the course of the argument it is further shown that this con
clusion is borne out by the history of the muscular movements which
are manifested in the coats of vessels and in the heart, while at the
same time this view is found to give the clue to the physical inter
pretation of “capillary action,” and of rhythm, whether this be in
the heart or elsewhere.
   It is shown, also, that the same conclusion is borne out by the
pathology of tremor, convulsion, and spasm, of those diseases, that
is to say, in which muscular contraction is in excess.         Thus, (to
mention one argument out of many,) the state of circulation which
is invariably associated with tremor, convulsion, and spasm, is one
which necessarily implies the diminution of         accustomed stimu   all

how is it that it relaxes in syncope, asphyxia, and death       These
objections are grave, but not unsurmountable, as the following hints
at explanation will serve to show.
   It must be understood, then, that that state of polar action which
is present in a muscle during rest and absent during contraction, is
re-established immediately after contraction; it must also be under
stood that this state of polar action in the muscle is suspended
during ordinary muscular contraction by certain changes which take
place in the nervous centre, and that it has died out when contrac
tion happens after death, as in rigor mortis; and the rest is suffi
ciently simple.                                                      -
   It is quite  in accordance with the   theory, then, that a muscle
should contract when nervous influence is withdrawn, and that it
should relax after the nerve is divided or otherwise paralysed.                   At
the moment when the continuity of the nerve is broken the muscle
contracts, because the influence of the nervous centre is cut off;
but this contraction cannot continue, because that state of polar
action which antagonizes contraction is immediately re-established
in the muscle, and in the portion of nerve connected with                     This                       it.

it does; thus the muscle contracts when the polar action                       sud                         is

vigorous than that of the nervous centre and nerve, and far less
dependent upon the supply of blood, is immediately re-established,
and being re-established, the muscle relaxes (just as it does in
the case where paralysis is caused by division of the nerve), and
tremor, convulsion and spasm are at an end.        Nor is there any doubt
that the nerves are paralysed when the circulation fails to the point
which is here supposed. Thus, if the circulation in the hand be
depressed by immersion in cold water, the sense of touch and the
power of movement are partially or wholly destroyed; or if the
principal vessel of a limb be tied, the nerves are similarly paralysed
until the collateral circulation be established; and in each case, also,
the power of provoking “reflex movements” is diminished or de
stroyed.     In either case the nerves are more or less paralysed for
want of blood, and, if so, it surely follows that the nerves must be
paralysed, and still more effectually, when the circulation fails as it
fails in syncope, asphyxia, or death, and when the movement of the
blood is almost or altogether at an end. Hence it is quite intelli
gible that tremor, convulsion or spasm should be caused by want of
blood, as is stated in the argument, and that they should cease in
 syncope, asphyxia, and death; and thus this objection falls to the
 ground, and with it all objections of the same kind.
    Such is an imperfect sketch of the evidence upon which the phy
 sical theory of muscular contraction is founded.

    “Remarks on the Anatomy of the Macgillivrayia pelagica and
 Cheletropis Hurleyi (Forbes); suggesting the establishment of a new
 genus of Gasteropoda.”       By John D. Macdonald, R.N., Assistant
 Surgeon H.M.S. Herald.
    Having examined the anatomy of the Macgillivrayia pelagica and
 several smaller species of pelagic Gasteropoda, not exhibiting the
 least similarity in the character of their shells, the author found that
 they all presented a very close relationship to each other in the type
 of their respiratory organs, and in other points of structure of less
 importance.
    The gills in every instance seemed to be fixed to the body of the
 animal immediately behind the head, and did not appear to be ap
 pended to the mantle, as in the Pectinibranchiata properly so called.
 They were also invariably four in number, and arranged in a cruci
 form manner round a central point. They were free in the rest of their
 extent, elongated and flattened in form, with a pointed extremity,
 and fringed with long flowing cilia, set in a frilled border.       They
 were, moreover, furnished with muscular fibres, both transverse and
 longitudinal, and exhibited great mobility when protruded, but lay
 side by side in the last whorl of the shell when retracted.
    The auditory capsules, each containing a spherical otolithe, were
 closely applied to the inner and posterior part of the larger or ante
 rior ganglion of the suboesophageal mass.
    There were two tentacula, each bearing at the outer side of

    298                         Royal Society.
    its base an eye consisting of a globular lens with optic nerve and
    retinal expansion. The foot was large and very mobile, but a vesi
    cular float has been observed only in Macgillivrayia.
       The respiratory siphon was either a simple fold of the mantle
    forming a temporary tube (Cheletropis), or a fold whose borders
    were united through their whole length, leaving an aperture at the
    end, as in Macgillivrayia.
       A lingual ribbon with well-marked rachis and pleurae occurs in
    all the species. Very perfect labial plates with closely-set dental
    points arm the mouth in some instances, and probably in all.
       The little animals possessing in common the characters here de
    scribed, nevertheless fabricate shells so very different as to admit of
    their division into well-marked genera.
       The author conceives that the obvious difference between the
    pectinibranchiate type of respiratory organs and that observed in
    the group of Gasteropoda now under consideration, affords sufficient
    grounds for placing the latter in a distinct order by themselves; and
    as illustrations of it he proceeds to give some details of the structure
    of the two species mentioned in the title of the paper, whose shells
    have been already described by the late Prof. E. Forbes, and figured
    in Mr. Macgillivray's ‘Narrative of the Voyage of H.M.S. Rattle
    snake.’
        In Macgillivrayia the disc of the foot is broad and connected by a
    narrow attachment to the body just beneath the neck; it carries an
    operculum behind, and is cleft by a notch in front.         A raphe ob
     servable in the median line, as well indeed as the whole character of
    this part of the organ, seems to shadow forth the transformation of
    the single foot of the Gasteropod into the wing-like expansion of
    the Pteropod.
        After describing the labial plates and lingual strap, the eyes and
    the branchiae, the author observes that the tubular siphon protrudes
    from the shell on the left side and seems to indicate the coexistence
     of a respiratory chamber with naked branchiae.
        The vesicular float, like that of Ianthina, noticed by Mr. Macgil
*   livray, consists of an aggregation of vesicles varying both in number
    and size in different cases. It is exceedingly delicate, and could not
    be found in the specimens first obtained, having probably been de
    stroyed or detached from the foot by the force of the water running
    through the meshes of the net with which they were captured. Its
    coexistence with an operculum shows that it is not a modification
    of the latter.
        Of the Cheletropis Hurleyi, numerous specimens were found in
     Bass's Straits and in the South Pacific, between Sydney and Lord
    Howe's Island.
        After giving some details respecting the shell and the foot, the
    author observes that the latter organ was destitute of float, at least
    in the specimens he obtained, but was furnished with an operculum,
    which, probably from      its   extreme thinness and smallness, had
    escaped the notice   of    Professor Forbes.   He then   points out the
                                                         -

  The portion of the mantle which forms the respiratory siphon, is
short, and its opposite edges are merely in apposition, without
organic union.    The branchiae are of two kinds, covered and naked.
The covered gill is single but of considerable length. It is beautifully
pectinated, and fringed with long cilia, and, doubtless, represents
the respiratory organ of the pectinibranchiate Gasteropoda.         The
basis of this part is a long and narrow strip of a tough and fibrous
material, folded upon itself into a series of loops invested with a
coating of epithelium, and richly ciliated along the free border.
The naked gills are four in number, similar both in situation and
character to those of Macgillivrayia.           Each gill is of an oval or
elongated form, presenting a thin, frilled and corrugated border,
beset with long whip-like cilia.        In the central parts muscular fibres
are distinctly discernible, some disposed lengthwise and others
transversely.
   The lingual strap is next described, as well as two file-like tri
turating plates with which the mouth is furnished.
    The two tentacula of each side appear as it were enclosed in one
envelope, so as to form a single tactile instrument, which bears a
large dark eye on           its
                          outer side near the base.       To this latter organ
the  tegumentary     covering  forms      kind  a   cornea,    of
                                                             beneath which                                is

   The first stage in the development of striated muscular fibre con
sists in the aggregation and adhesion of the cytoblasts, and their in
 vestment by blastemaso as to form elongated masses. In these clusters
 the nuclei have, at first, no regular arrangement. Almost, if not quite
 as soon as the cytoblasts are thus aggregated, they become invested
 by the blastema, and this substance at the same time appears to be
 much condensed, so that many of the nuclei become obscured.
    These nuclei, thus aggregated and invested, next assume a much
more regular position.       They fall into a single row with remarkable
uniformity, and the surrounding substance at the same time grows
 clear and more transparent, and is arranged in the form of two bands
bordering the fibre and bounding the extremities of the nuclei, so
that now they become distinctly visible. They are oval, and form a
single row in the centre of the fibre, closely packed together side by
side, their long axes lying transversely, and their extremities bounded
on either side by a thin clear pellucid border of apparently homoge
neous substance.
    It is to be observed how closely the muscular fibres of mammalia
at this period of their development resemble their permanent form in
many insects.
    The fibres next increase in length and the nuclei separate. Small
intervals appear between them. The spaces rapidly widen, until at
last the nuclei    lie   atvery considerable distance apart. At the same
                            a
time the fibre strikingly decreases       diameter; for
                                                 in           the nuclei se as
parate, the lateral bands fall       and ultimately coalesce.
                                           in
    This lengthening        the fibre and consequent separation
                              of                                         the                  of
nuclei is   due to     an

the fibre.
    Soon after the nuclei have separated some        them begin  of   decay.
They increase     in size; their outline becomes indistinct;           bright          a to
border appears immediately within their margin; their contents be
 come decidedly granular; their outline           broken and interrupted;

these soon disappear.
  It  sometimes happens that the nuclei perish while            contact, be   in
fore the fibre elongates; but the subsequent changes are the same.
   The striae generally first become visible            this period, imme

             to byis                           size, and

  At  the period of birth muscular fibres vary much in size.
  The several   stages in the development of muscular fibre, above
mentioned, do not succeed each other as a simple consecutive series;
on the contrary, two, or more, are generally progressing at the same
time.   Nor does each commence at the same period in        cases.                               all

   “Elasticity   the property which bodies possess
                        is                            preserving deter                of

which      in   a   homogeneous body manifests                   itself     equally        in   every   part     of
appreciable     magnitude.”
    The investigations are limited by the following conditions:—
     1. The temperature            the elastic body
                                       of                   supposed        is  con               to    be

                                       those variations.

attractive force acting                on

   Twenty-one equations express the relations between the systems
of coefficients of elasticity in a given body for any two different
systems of orthogonal axes.
   When a body possesses a system of orthogonal aires of elasticity,
its coefficients of elasticity, when referred to these axes, are reduced
to nine.
    A body isotropic with respect to elasticity has but three coefficients
of elasticity, which are the same for                  sets allorthogonal axes, and
                                                                             of

tracted from the nine actual reduced external pressures, there re
main nine residual reduced external pressures for each such element,
which form three systems, each suitable for development in series
of trigonometrical functions of a different pair of independent co
ordinates.
     V. The parts of the three projections of the molecular displacement,
 which correspond to each system of residues of the reduced external
 pressures, are to be expressed by infinite series in terms of the sines
 and cosines of linear functions of the proper pair of independent co
 ordinates, each order of terms containing (except in some special
 cases) four kinds of trigonometric functions, multiplied by six expo
 nential functions of the third co-ordinate, whose parameters are the
 roots of an equation of the sixth order, and by twenty-four arbi
 trary constants.
     From the expressions thus formed are to be computed symbolical
 expressions for the values of the system of residues or transcendental
 parts of the reduced external pressures, for each pair of independent
 co-ordinates, which, by the aid of the equation of the form of the
 surface of the body, are to be transformed into series containing
 terms in trigonometric functions of the independent co-ordinates
 only, multiplied by linear functions of the arbitrary constants, which
 are (in general) twenty-four times as numerous as the orders of
 terms.
     VI. By equating the constant factor of each term of the symbo
 lical developments thus formed, to the constant factor of the corre

    Series of functions trigonometric in y and z, exponential in r, and
satisfying the equations of internal equilibrium, with arbitrary con
stant coefficients, are taken to represent the molecular displacements
produced by the residual pressures on the faces normal to w. From
those series are computed series representing symbolically those re
sidual pressures, which series being equated to the series numerically
representing those pressures, the arbitrary constants are found by
elimination.                                    -
    The formulae thus obtained are  employed   to compute ideal systems
of external pressures on the faces normal to y and z, called “Provi
sional pressures,” which are developed in trigonometric functions of
the independent co-ordinates of the faces to which they are conceived
to be applied.      Should the provisional pressures agree with the
actual residual pressures on those faces, the process is complete;
should they not so agree, the provisional pressures are to be sub
tracted from the actual residual pressures, leaving systems of re
mainders called “Secondary pressures.”
    The series representing the molecular displacements corresponding
to the Secondary Pressures on the faces normal to y are to be found
in the manner already referred                     to.

 and may belong to one or other of eight classes, according as it is
 even or odd with respect to r, y and 2.
    The processes of derivation applicable to the primitive functions
contain three arbitrary constants for each primitive function.    Hence
when there is a series of primitive functions of different orders, there
are twenty-four arbitrary constants for each order of terms.
    In the developments of the residual external pressures, there are
also twenty-four constant coefficients for each order of terms, of
which the arbitrary constants are linear functions.
   The notation of M. Lamé's work on the Mathematical Theory of
the Elasticity of Solid Bodies, so far as it relates to isotropic sub
stances, is compared with that of this paper.
   Reference being made to the known method of representing the
elastic pressures at a given particle of a solid, in magnitude and di
rection, by the radii of an ellipsoid, and the positions of the surfaces
to which those pressures are applied by those of the tangent planes
to an ellipsoid or hyperboloid, the difference (not generally attended
to) between the cone of tangential pressures, and the cone of sliding,
is pointed out. This difference is important in the theory of the
strength of materials.

circulation of the retinal blood is very frequent, and produces very
singular phaenomena.      We may produce the uncommon states of the
retinal circulation at pleasure, by artifices described; and it is shown
that it is the retinal circulation which is the cause of all the phaeno

     This head commences with the quotation of a passage from Sir
 David Brewster's “Optics’ which he offered towards an explanation
 of the difficulty of seeing a very faint star by direct vision; and it is
 shown that the retina is not liable, as Brewster imagines, to be
 thrown into a state of “undulatory” perception by our looking
 through the teeth of a “fine comb” or through a single “narrow
 aperture.”      The paper points out that the effect observed in these
 circumstances is produced by our looking near the edge of any body
 whatever, provided, and only then, that the object move, be it never
 so  little, across the eye's aris. It shows that the same effect is pro
 duced by light radiating from a point, by a flame, by lenses, curved
reflectors, whilst they are in the act of moving across the eye's axis;
 or by the movement of the eye itself, merely in relation to the light
entering it,-even the naked eye along the sky.                  The effect pro
duced is shown to be       simply    owing   to  this;   that the retina, under
such    action,  ceases to   perceive   in the   spaces    corresponding to its
blood-vessels and      capillaries,  so that   they completely    display them
selves in the semblance of black bodies (or            lines);   and the law is
arrived at, that the images of external points which are painted on
the vessels and capillaries are not perceived when the retina loses
light from one point of space and receives light from another point of
space within a certain interval      of  time,  or that the percipient    points
lying in front of the vessels require          a certain time to perceive.     A
physiological hypothesis is suggested to account for this phaeno
menon, on the presumption that the “radial fibres,” which project
from the layer of rods and comes and end in the limitary      -
                                                                     membrane,
are the ultimate percipients of light.
    It is pointed out how wonderfully close we may find the corre
spondence between the microscopical and optical anatomy of the
retina.      Each pair of identical fibres of the two optic nerves must
be regarded as one nerve.           Another supposed anomaly to the sim
plicity of nervous action being explained on anatomical principles, a
statement of ordinary optical nervous action is made, and a summary
evinces how the anomalies in visual experience are due to the com
plex additions to a simple organ of sight.

    The Lecturer commenced with remarking that the bearing of the
experiments, of which he was about to give a notice, was not
limited to their ostensible object, but that it applied to all the bodies
of the solar system. The professed object of the experiments was
to obtain a measure of the density of the earth, and therefore of the
mass of the earth (its dimensions being known); but the ordinary
data of astronomy, taken in conjunction with the laws of gravitation,
give the relative proportions of the mass of the earth to the masses of
the sun and the principal planets; and thus the determination of the

absolute masses of the sun and planets.                   To show how this propor

      graduated arc which it crossed at the two places, would show how
      much the direction of gravity at one place is inclined to the direction
      of gravity at the other place.]           Now from our knowledge of the
      form and dimensions of the          earth,   we know that the direction of
      gravity changes very nearly one second of angle for every 100 feet
      of horizontal distance. Suppose then that two stations were taken
      on Schehallien, one on the north side and the other on the south
      side, and suppose that their distance was 4000 feet; then, if the
      direction of gravity had not been influenced by the mountain, the
     inclination of the directions of gravity at these two places would
     have been about 40 seconds. But suppose, on applying the zenith
     sector in the way just described, the inclination was found to be
     really 52 seconds. The difference, or 12 seconds, could only be
     explained by the attraction of the mountain, which, combined with
     what may be called the natural direction of gravity, produced
     directions inclined to these natural directions.              In order to infer
     from this the density of the earth, a calculation was made (founded
     upon a very accurate measure of the mountain) of what would have
     been the disturbing effect of the mountain if the mountain had been
     as dense as the interior of the earth.             It was found that the dis
     turbance would have been about 27 seconds. But the disturbance
     was really found to be only 12 seconds.              Consequently the propor
     tion of the    density  of the mountain to the earth's density was that
     of 12 to   27,  or 4 to 9 nearly. And from this, and the ascertained
     density of the mountain, it followed that the mean specific gravity
     of the earth would be about five times that of water. The only ob
     jection to this admirable experiment                     is,

                               in                                          his                                    of

rocks    (to which further allusion will             made) was soon foundbe
to    be the most serious difficulty.        The personal labour was also
very great. They had, however, made               certain progress when,
                                                                     a                                                   on

     In1828 the same party, with the assistance              Mr. Sheepshanks        of
and other friends, repeated the experiment             the same place. After  in
mastering several difficulties, they were stopped by               slip       the                 a               of

  swings is found, there is yet another thing required :—namely, the                                 .
  proportion of upper-clock-pendulum-swings           to lower-clock-pendu
  lum-swings in the same time ; or, in other words, the proportion of
  the clock rates. It was for this that the galvanic signals were re
  quired.     A galvanometer was attached to each clock, and an appa
  ratus was provided in a small auxiliary clock, which completed a cir
  cuit at every 15 seconds nearly. The wire of this circuit, passing
  from a small battery through the auxiliary clock, then went through
  the upper galvanometer, then passed down the shaft of the mine to
  the lower galvanometer, and then returned to the battery.              At each
  galvanometer there was a small apparatus for breaking circuit.              At
  times previously arranged, the circuit was completed by this appa
  ratus at both stations, and then it was the duty of the observers at
  both stations to note the clock times of the same signals; and these
  evidently give comparisons of the clocks, and therefore give the
  means of comparing their rates.           Thus (by steps previously ex
 plained) the number of swings made by the upper pendulum is
 compared with the number of swings made in the same time by the
 lower pendulum.
     Still the result is not complete, because it may be influenced by
  the peculiarities of each pendulum.           In order to overcome these,
 after   pendulum    A had been used above and pendulum B below, they
 were     reversed;   pendulum B being observed above, and A below;
 and    this,  theoretically,  completes the operation.       But in order to
  ensure that the      pendulum   received no injury in the interchange, it
 is desirable again to repeat the experiments with A above and B
 below, and again with B above and A below.
     In this manner the pendulums were observed with 104 hours of
 incessant observations, simultaneous at both stations, A above and
 B below; then with 104 hours, B above and A below ; then with
 60 hours, A above and B below; then with 60 hours, B above and
 A below. And 2454 effective signals were observed at each station.
     The result   is,   that the pendulums suffered           injury   no  their       in
 changes; and that the acceleration               the pendulum
                                                         of               being       on

     It does not appear likely that this determination can              sensibly  be
in    error.   The circumstances          experiment

hollow of Jarrow Slake, and on the sea-coast. It is also necessary
to obtain more precise determinations of the specific gravities of the
rocks about Harton Colliery than have yet been procured. Measures
are in progress for supplying all these deficiencies.   It seems pro
bable that the resulting number for the earth's density will probably
be diminished by these more accurate estimations.

ON    THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF MINERALS BELONGING TO

     TION OF VAPOURS UPON ROCKs.  BY M. DAUBRéE.
        ODERN geology admits        as proved, that the rocks in contact or in
         the neighbourhood of the massive crystalline strata have
undergone some modification; to this theoretical idea they owe their
name of metamorphic rocks.

temperature has been admitted as the principal agent of meta
morphism.      Nevertheless the intervention of heat alone cannot ex

  are often grouped perpendicularly to each other, like the prisms of
  staurolite.     In the same way, with magnesia, peridote is obtained in
  rectangular prisms.
     Alumina gives a silicate in elongated prisms, with oblique bases,
  which are not attacked by acids, are infusible, and possess all the
  characters of disthene.         It is very interesting in this case to see
  chloride of aluminium formed at the expense of the silicium.
     To form a double or multiple silicate, it is necessary not only to
  mix the bases in suitable proportions, but also to furnish the oxygen
 necessary for the formation of the silicic acid, by the addition of an
  excess of one of the bases or of lime.
     A mixture of lime and magnesia furnishes crystals of diopside
 perfectly colourless and transparent; they present the broad trun
  cation and the bevel usual with augite.                 Seven equivs. of potash
  or soda and one equiv. of alumina, or one equiv. of alkali, one equiv.
  of alumina, and six equivs. of lime, produce by the action of chloride
 of silicium, crystals in oblique prisms with obtuse bevelments, which
 are scarcely acted upon by acids, and fuse before the blowpipe, pre

   By the reaction of perchloride of iron upon lime I have obtained
haematite,   either in very distinct specular crystals like those of Saint
Gothard, or in transparent hexagonal laminae, presenting by refraction
a ruby-red colour.      Perchloride of iron mixed with chloride of zinc,
furnishes, under the same conditions, a crystalline compound analo
gous to franklinite.
   Lastly, crystallized magnesia, or the periclase of La Somma, may
easily be obtained by the reaction of lime upon chloride of magne
sium, which is found amongst the abundant chlorinated vapours of
the fumaroles of Vesuvius.          The same chloride, decomposed by
aqueous vapour, also furnishes periclase, and chloride of zinc gives
 crystalline oxide of zinc.

furnished with minerals, such as those of Saint Gothard, Sweden,
Finland, or the United States, we find that the introduction of chlo
rides, mixed with fluorides and sometimes with sulphuretted com
pounds, accounts for the formation of their most characteristic
minerals.      In this explanation we must include the rich deposits of
red oxide of zinc with franklinite in New Jersey, as well as different
masses of specular iron, and protoxide of iron, which have also been                -
produced in the limestone.
    We find magnesian compounds, such as spinel, chondrodite, mica,
pyroxene, amphibole, warwickite, and serpentine accumulated, some
times in large quantities, in limestones which contain no magnesia.
This fact, hitherto unexplained, would only be a consequence of the
different chemical affinities of lime and magnesia, for throughout our
experiments we see chloride of magnesium precipitated by lime;
and when these bases are both in the presence of chloride of silicium
or aluminium, the lime yields                          its
                                           oxygen, and the magnesia remain

       nomena of the Rainbow.    By Professor Potter, A.M.”
      T the meeting of the British Association for the Advance
        ment of Science at Cambridge in 1833,          exhibited the          I
experiment of the interference of light near a caustic, which                                   I
had a short time before discovered when examining the circle of
aberration of a spherical mirror for a reflecting microscope. This
circle of aberration was formed by using a luminous point, which
was an image of the sun given by a small globule of mercury,
for an object of which the image produced by the spherical
mirror was to be examined.     In place of the circle of aberration
being a disc brightest at the edge and shading away gradually
towards the centre, as we should expect from geometrical optics,
it appeared a magnificent phaenomenon of the interference of
light, consisting of brilliant and black rings coloured on their
edges.
   The outer ring, instead of being brightest at      outer edge,             its
as  we should have  expected  from the   undulatory  theory, since
the rays had travelled over equal spaces, shaded away gradually.
I  concluded that had fallen upon confirmation

322           Prof. Potter on the Interference of Light near a Caustic,
   Whilst an undergraduate at Cambridge, on studying the
theory of the rainbow I found that it belonged to the same class
of interferences near a caustic, and was not aware, until informed
by Professor Whewell, that Dr. Young had applied the principle
of ray interference to explain the occurrence of supernumerary
rainbows seen frequently within the primary bow, and some
times exterior to the secondary bow, of which the Newtonian
theory of the rainbow furnishes no account.
         In       published in vol.
              a paper                         140               vi.
                                                      the Cambridge    p.             of
 Transactions,     have shown the
                           I       necessity     the doctrine    inter      of                             of
 ference     solve the phaenomena, and have traced the caustic for
                 to
 the primary bow.      At the time      writing that paper of    1835,                                     in
 1 had not entered into any adequate examination             the point                             of
 whether the rainbow occurred                                   or
                                         within the caustic, but did
                                                          at
  so soon afterwards,  and    urged   that  I  was found within the    it
 caustic       discussion

                                               In
 1838 will be found the calculations on which this conclusion
 was founded, showing that there was darkness           the place for                      at
 merly attributed      the rainbow.

  Not being aware that the primary rainbow was also within                                                           its

that this solution did not represent the natural phaenomena.
Professor Miller, however, undertook an experimental examina
tion of the analogous phaenomena, in M. Babinet’s experiment,
in which they are observed in a small cylindrical vertical stream
of water, and he has published a paper in vol. vii. of the Cam
bridge Transactions, detailing the measures of some of the results.
He found the light to extend outside the calculated place of the
caustic, in accordance with Mr. Airy's investigation, and that
the dark bars or minima near the caustic were nearly in the rela
tive places as given by that investigation; but he has not given
the places of the bright bars or maxima, which         find do not    I
agree with their calculated places.
                            I
   At that time commenced a repetition of these experiments,
and found like results with Professor Miller as to light extend
ing outside the caustic.   I found, however, as will be seen below,
that the light extended further and further outside it as the
velocity of the stream was greater. The discrepancy between
these results and those from the natural phaenomena evidently
arose from the refractive index being slightly different, and a
little less for water falling in such a stream and about to break
into drops, from that for still water.
     Idid not at that time think of any method of experimenting
with water at rest, which               I
                               now find is so easy to be employed,
but      I
      prepared   a prism   and small cylinder of plate-glass; the
prism served to determine the refractive indices of the rays to be
used, and the cylinder gave the irises in position in accordance
with those from the natural phaenomena of the rainbow, and not
in accordance with those from the running stream. The expe
riments extended to within a few days of my leaving Cambridge
to commence the duties of my Professorship at University Col
lege.  They have been only resumed lately in consequence of
my arriving at this part of physical optics in a general investi
gation of the whole science, which                   I
                                          hope before much longer
time has  elapsed  to lay before the scientific public in a continuous
treatise.
  The following were obtained in Queens’ College, Cambridge.
A heliostat reflected the sum’s light through a narrow vertical
aperture, which falling at a distance of about 5 feet on a fine
Munich prism with                 its
                         edge vertical, furnished very pure pris  a
matic beam      light. Of this beam the rays from orange
                       of                                                           to

water.        This stream      water was directly over the centre
                                   of                                the       of

 324    Prof. Potter  on the Interference of Light near a Caustic,
for a small telescope, of length       4%  inches, which magnified
rather more than twice, and adjusted to show distant objects
 distinctly.  It had micrometer lines at the common focus of the
object and eye-glasses crossed at an angle of about 35°, the
bisection of which was vertical. The image to be viewed in the
telescope was brought to the bisection of this angle, and the
measures were taken from the iris on one side of the perpendi
 cular ray to that on the opposite side of it; the angle traversed
being divided by two, gave the distance from the perpendicular
ray for each iris.
    On the 17th of September, 1841, in two good experiments
with green light for the fixed line E, the extreme visible light was
found to extend to 42° 21}' in one experiment, and to 42° 21' in
the other, from the ray falling perpendicularly on the stream;
and the calculated place of the primary rainbow, if it were at the
caustic, for this colour is 41°40', therefore light was seen 41'
beyond the caustic.
    In two experiments with orange light, fixed line D, the extreme
visible light was found to extend to 42°41' in one, and 42° 584
in the other from the normal ray.           The calculation for the
caustic gives 42° 2' nearly, and hence the light was seen 39' and
56}' outside the caustic.
    Another experiment with yellow green light between the lines
D and E gave a distance 42° 33}', to which the light could be
traced. Measures of the first six maxima or bright bars were
taken, and though probably correct, yet on returning to the first
maximum for verification some derangement had occurred, so
that no argument can be taken from them to have weight.
    The stream was formed in passing through a small circular
aperture of ºth of an inch diameter, in a brass nozle on a pipe
furnished with a stopcock, which acted as a siphon from an
elevated pneumatic trough, so that the velocity of the stream
could be regulated by the stopcock.
                    I
    On October 2, tried the effect of different velocities on the
position of the bars, and found with green light, when the inter
ference bars were most distinct, the extreme visible light extended
to a reading on the circle of 269°9', and when the velocity was
greater, it extended to a reading of 267° 35'; and from the mature
of the reading, the light extended to 1934 further beyond the
caustic in the latter than in the former case. In another trial
with green light and the bars most distinct, the extreme visible
light gave a reading of 269°4'; but with a greater velocity and
the bars still visible, the reading was 267° 16', or the difference
was 1°48'. When the full stream was allowed to run, the extreme
light extended still further, but the bars were not seen.
    These experiments, coupled with the measures of the natural

                            and the        Phaenomena     of the Rainbow.                                      325
 rainbow, lead us to conclude, that if the cylinder of water had
  been at rest, the extreme visible light might not have extended
 even up to the caustic.
     In resuming the experiments lately, have had as a reservoir   I
 for the water, a common glass bottle with
 the bottom broken off, as in the figure: a
 glass tube drawn with the blowpipe to a
 fine tapering aperture passed through the
 cork in its neck. When the water in the
 reservoir was at some height, as a b, and
 the stream cd was formed, it was received
 in a catch-tube, as in the figure, and led
 away.     The part of c d which appeared
 cylindrical and without ripples, either from
the lower end falling on the catch-tube,                                  .
or from         breaking into drops, was ad

326          On  the Interference  of Light near a Caustic.
pressures produces a slight but sensible effect upon the distance
to which the light extends beyond the caustic.
    The side of the tube being oiled, with a little care in adding
 small quantities of water after the stream had ceased to run, I
obtained on the 10th of April a good drop at the extremity of
the tube, which remained perfect to the end of the experiments.
The drop obtained in this manner is larger than one would wish,
but the telescope being carefully adjusted to distant objects, or
for parallel rays, and the observations being always taken at the
centre of the field of view, there is no correction of the observa
tions required on that account. The iris being steady, was much
better seen than in the running stream, and the maxima or
bright bars were counted to upwards of forty when a piece of
red glass was held before the eye.
    The drop being Toth of an inch in diameter, and the other
circumstances as in the last experiments, the following measures
were obtained for the limit beyond which no light could be dis
cerned, from the perpendicular ray:—
                                4;  23
                                42 23#
                                42 24;
                                42 21
    A good set of measures of the places of the first six maxima
were also obtained, whose distances, counted from the caustic,
approximated in progression to those of Newton’s reflected rings,
counting from a black centre as ordinarily considered, namely
they approximated to the progression of the values of 1, V8,
 w/5, wº, &c.
    As the extreme limit of the visible red was taken, it is clear
that since the asymptote of the caustic or place ordinarily
assigned to the primary rainbow, for the fixed line B is 42° 22'
from the perpendicular ray, therefore mo light extends beyond
this ; and that the rays which have traversed equal spaces pro
duce darkness in interfering, contrary to the fundamental require
ment of the undulatory theory.
   The support which that theory has so long had, from experi
ments made with running water compared with calculations for
still water, must now cease.

     THEeffects,      the complete solution of which, it may be
assumed, is still very distant from us.             Thus the explanation
given by Cauchy, in conformity with the notions of Fresnel,
that the sphere of attraction of the molecules is comparable in
magnitude with the length of undulation, has not yet been
applied to doubly refracting bodies; and so far as Cauchy’s
theory has reference to isophanous bodies it also needs comple
tion, inasmuch as the action of the medium itself is not taken
into aceount.     Further, as regards the phaenomena of absorp
tion, there is certainly no lack of explanations, but the difficulty
is to apply them in each particular case; and, as several causes
work together, to appropriate to each               due proportion         its

   If therefore the colours of bodies are to be explained by reso

we arrive with ease at the third of the principles referred to,                                                                !

   2. It is necessary to distinguish strictly the absorption of
light from              its

result    weakening the passing rays; but they differ from each

omitted none of the more important ones. The simple inspec

tendency to appear in groups.        In this manner they show them
selves with lead, particularly in the yellow and blue-violet field;
with zinc in the red and blue; with bismuth several distinct
groups are formed. In general, with the more fusible metals
the lines seem to spread themselves more.           With mercury and
lead the longest go into violet.         It is singular that gold and
silver have a common line in green; but besides this, silver has
a few common with mercury.

alimit value, under which it cannot fall. He found that a spark,
4 inches in length, passed in a less time than the millionth part
of a second.   But a stream of light 6 feet long, in a glass tube
partially exhausted, showed itself also unchanged in the rotating
mirror; and as, according to Masson, the spark cannot otherwise
propagate itself in vacuo than by the particles from the poles
themselves, it would follow that at least 3 feet were passed
over in less than the millionth part of a second.    This gives a
velocity which in               all

observations began.                     I
                         made use of the same flint-glass prism
as before, so that the results obtained, strictly speaking, are only
valid for those kinds of light for which the flint-glass is diapha
nous. This is the more necessary to be mentioned here, as it is
easy to forget how much glass in general absorbs the extreme
ends of the spectrum.                        I
                            must also mention that the gases made
use of were not perfectly pure, although                    I
                                           do not believe that an
erroneous result could be produced by the impurity present;
the reader will be able to infer this from the statement of the
manner in which the gases were prepared.
   12. Owygen.—The gas was obtained from chlorate of potash,
and was introduced directly into the apparatus.    The spectrum
obtained in this instance is shown at 0, fig. 3. If this spectrum
be compared with that of the atmosphere, it is seen,      1st, that
the strongest lines of the air  spectrum,  which in fig. 1 are de
noted by y, 8, D, E, have disappeared; and 2nd, that the blue
and violet field exhibit new lines which do not appear in the
other case.
    With regard, further, to the metal lines in the case of copper
and zinc, they were almost imperceptible at the end of the expe
riment. This was particularly the case with the zinc in the blue
field. From this it seems that we may conclude, that the bright
lines corresponding to the metal are not produced by the oxida
tion of the latter, for if this were the case, they must show them
selves strongest in oxygen.     Nevertheless the surface of the brass
spheres showed that an oxidation had taken place, and it is pos
sible that the cause of the phaenomenon alluded to is to be sought
here.
   13. Carbonic Acid.—The gas was prepared in the ordinary
way by means of sulphuric acid and chalk, and was carried, for
the purpose of drying       through         it,

   17. Nitrogen.—It follows from what has gone before, that the
bright lines in the air spectrum belong almost exclusively to the
nitrogen.   To submit this conclusion to a direct test, enclosed                               I
a stick of phosphorus in the apparatus and ignited it by means
of a heated copper wire, introduced through the small opening
which permitted the issue of the gas. The aperture was then
closed.   The nitrogen thus obtained is not pure, but is mixed
with a white smoke of phosphoric acid; this, however, falls and
leaves the nitrogen alone behind.   The electric                                  spark showed the
same appearances as in atmospheric air. This                                       result not only
corroborates the conclusion already referred to,                                  but it also shows
that the presence of the phosphoric acid does                                     not produce any
change, and that the                    air

which here showed themselves upon the surface of the metal
only.   It seems, therefore, that in this case the air alone trans
mitted the electricity, but did not impart to the ordinary spec
trum a sufficient strength of light, because the metallic particles
did not by their motion cause the particles of air to glow. It
would be well, however, to make this the subject of further                       in
vestigation. To the same portion of the subject belongs pro
bably a fact which          I
                       have several times observed, namely, that
when one of the   poles  is formed of a fluid, of sulphuric acid for
example, the lines in the corresponding half of the air spectrum
are much weaker than in the other.
   19. The experiments which              I
                                      made with different metallic
sulphurets led to no remarkable result.        In general they gave
the composition of the metal more or less completely.         There
was no difference  observed,  whether the   sulphuret received from
the apparatus positive or negative electricity. As examples,                        I
have given in fig. 2 the spectra for the sulphuret of lead and
sulphuret of iron.    The latter, however, is distinguished by the
fact, that in the vicinity of the line y, and also in violet, bright
lines are shown which were not observed in my experiments with
iron. These lines could not, however, belong to the sulphur,
because they must then exhibit themselves with other metallic
sulphurets.
    Sulphur, like carbon, seems to have no peculiar lines.             have  I
made the    experiment,    not  only  with  charcoal,   but also with gra
phite, and have obtained no lines which could be regarded of the
same character as those exhibited by the metals.               The lines of
the air   spectrum,    indeed,    particularly  in the    violet, appeared
stronger than    ordinary;   and in several of the bright portions fine
lines were plainly visible (e.g. at H, fig.             1),

possibility of exciting in two bodies coincident molecular vibra
tions, where under ordinary circumstances such do not exist.
   The chemical activity belongs, nevertheless, to a certain class
of rays. Becquerel states, “que chaque substance sensible voie le
rayonnement à sa manière,” and this is capable of very extensive
application. Thus hydrogen, in contact with spongy platinum,
is thrown into a condition in which it can enter into combination
with oxygen; and the blue colour of sunlight excites in chlo
rine the power of entering into union with hydrogen. These
blue rays act also most powerfully on the solid constituents of
plants, while the yellow rays have most to do in producing
the green colour, and so on.   Hence there are no rays in the
solar spectrum which do not possess a chemical power, although
the violet end of the spectrum, on account of the part acted by
oxygen  in most chemical changes, shows itself here most influ
ential. Further, the combustion of most bodies and their com
bination with oxygen produces a blue flame; zinc has a great
affinity for oxygen, and nitrogen a feeble one; and     this seems                        all

time of oscillation is only true of wave motion; and as long as
the luminous ray exists in this form, the time of oscillation is
unchanged. When, however, it is absorbed by a medium, the
particles of which are thereby set in vibration, the wave motion
passes into a pendulum motion, and the law of unchangeability
ceases to be true.    The molecular motions, however, communi
cate themselves to the aether, and a new wave motion is thus
generated, which, as regards the time of oscillation, is different
from that of the incident light, but the same as that of the pen
dulum motion from which it originates.
   As before remarked, we have long possessed in the absorption
of calorific rays an example of a similar change.    Between the
dispersed  light and the absorbed heat there           however,      im   is,                    an

object meets a flat screen after refraction, both object and screen
being perpendicular to the axis of the lens, and the points where
they intersect the axis being conjugate foci. The formulae give
immediately the amount of the diffusion, or spread of the rays of
any pencil over the surface of the photographic plate, and the
effects due to obliquity and aperture respectively are easily deduced.
Though they are adapted directly to the case justmentioned, they
may without much difficulty be made to suit any other. The fol
lowing investigation might, in fact, be accurately described as a
general view of the theory of spherical mirrors and lenses; this
will appear by the deduction of the most important cases usually
treated, as well as that which is the immediate object of inquiry.

Mr. T. S. Hunt's Examinations of                    some Felspathic               Rocks.        355
graphite, and other characteristic minerals.       Associated with
these limestones, there is another rock forming an important
member of the group, and consisting chiefly of felspar, with
small portions of black mica, green pyroxene, and occasional
grains of garnet, epidote, and more rarely of quartz. This rock
is often marked by the presence of small portions of hyperstheme;
from the presence of this mineral, these masses have been described
by the New York geologists as hypersthene rock.         In addition
to these minerals we may add ilmenite, or titaniferous iron ore,
which occurs sometimes in large masses, and at other times in
small disseminated grains, which like the hypersthene appear to
mark the planes of stratification. If to these we add small por
tions of iron pyrites and a little disseminated carbonate of lime,
we have the mineralogy of the rock so far as yet known.
   The texture of these felspar rocks is varied; sometimes the
mass is a confusedly crystalline aggregate, exhibiting cleavage
surfaces three or four lines in diameter, with a fine-grained,
somewhat        calcareous paste   in the interstices.       Sometimes the
whole rock is uniformly granular, while more frequently a gra
nular base holds at intervals cleavable masses of felspar, often
several inches in diameter.         The colours of these rocks vary from
grayish and bluish-white to lavender and violet-blue; flesh-red,
greenish and brownish tints are also met with ; the colours are
rarely brilliant.     These felspars seldom occur in distinct crystals,
but their  cleavage    is triclinic, a fact which, coupled with their
densities varying from 2.66 to 2-73, shows them to belong to
the group of which albite and anorthite may be taken as the
representatives.      The bluish cleavable varieties often exhibit the
opalescence of labradorite, to which species American mineralo
gists have hitherto referred them; but with the exception of a
few analyses by myself, we have no published analyses of any of
these felspars.      My investigations show, that while                  them       all   of
are felspars with      abase     lime and soda, the composition varies
                                     of
very much, being sometimes that                labradorite, andesine

account for the change of temperature in Greenland and in the
northern part of Baffin's Bay.
   But then comes the question, how it is possible to reconcile
this extension of ice and snow in certain regions with the
general constancy of the mean temperature of the earth, which
may be inferred from historical evidence proving that the limits
of cultivation of the best known vegetable products have not
perceptibly altered for the last 3000 years, or even a much
longer period. If no cosmical causes have interfered to alter
the annual supply of heat received by the earth, and if no im
portant change has occurred in the distribution of land and sea,
it may be thought impossible that any reduction should occur in
the general mean temperature, such as would be implied in the
asserted cooling down of some districts, without a corresponding
increase of temperature elsewhere.     To this I venture to reply,
that the increase of   alpine glacier and polar ice does imply an
increase of mean temperature in those spots where the accumulation
originates.  To return to the Alps from whence started, assert     I                  I
that a reservoir wherein the annual deposit of snow exceeds the
annual melting and outflow, must have a mean temperature
below the freezing-point, that before the rock or soil was con
stantly covered with snow or ice                   its
                                        mean temperature must
have been    still lower, and that the result               of   the accumulation          is
to raise that mean temperature.
   To illustrate this, let     suppose that, instead
                                  us                     the intense        of

                                                             of
between the Lena and the      Jenisei, the prevalence    moist winds    of
                      great annual fall                                we
should determine       a                     snow,  of of
                                                       cannot doubt
but that    anenormous accumulation       névé and ice would pro
ceed for  ages  until condition was
                         a            produced  similar      that                to        of
the antarctic polar lands, the mean temperature          the region     of of
itself would     be
                 considerably increased, while that     some neigh
bouring districts would      diminished, the general mean for the

whole earth and for countries not within reach of the immediate
operating causes remaining unaltered.

   The various formulae necessary to produce different crystalline
forms are given in detail.
   The author enters into a re-discussion of the double refractive
powers, and attempts to show that Herapathite possesses a prin
cipal axis having “positive” characters. He also endeavoured to
measure the thickness of certain very thin plates, by the differen
tial tints produced by the exercise of their doubly refracting
powers upon the colours of the selenite stages, and found that
these thin plates raised the blue of the second order to the yellow
and violet; the red of the second to the violet and blue-gray;
and the green of the same to orange and violet of the second
order.    Assuming, therefore, this substance to have similar
doubly refracting powers to selenite, and of equal intensity, and
also the same index of refraction, their thickness may be estimated
as equal to that of a plate of selenite necessary to give the same
difference in tint, viz. 000517 of an inch.
    These very thin plates no longer possessed the Cantharides
like or brilliant metallic green colour when examined by reflected
light.   They appeared more like portions of the elytra of the
Blatta   germanica;   still reflecting a polarized beam, but of a
brown colour, and also retaining their doubly absorbent powers
when examined by transmitted light.
   The author considers that his recent investigations indicate
that whatever properties Professor Stokes may have assigned to
the ray reflected from the a-prisms (which alone were experi
mented on by him) in the principal plane of the breadth, must
be equally true in that reflected from the primary rhombic prism
in the principal plane of         length, its                      its

trary constants C and h satisfy the equation Ch*=p^, the con
sequent value of the eccentricity is the same as that given by
the second approximation. Thus the third approximation is not
contradictory to the second.          At the same time it is incapable of
establishing the truth of the theorem, as appears from the fol
lowing considerations.
    In the method of treating the lunar theory which have pro      I
posed, no use is made, as in previous methods, of the radius
vector and longitude of an assumed revolving ellipse; but instead
of this process, the terms containing the sun's longitude are
separated from those which do not                     it explicitly, and the
                                           contain

These   equations,   as   given   by   the third approximation, are the

 The development of # was found to contain an additional term
 independent of the sun's longitude, but as it is of the fourth
 order, it is omitted in the third approximation.               By the above

 appears that the apsidal motion is deduced            in the third approxi
 mation from equations which are the same             in form as if the force
 were wholly central, and consequently, so far as this approxima
 tion shows, the eccentricity is arbitrary.           But on proceeding to
                                                         º
 the fourth  approximation,       the term above mentioned must be

 taken into account, in consequence of which                     is no longer
 constant for the mean orbit, and the force cannot be regarded as
 wholly central.    The mean motion of the apse and the form of
 the mean orbit are now dependent in part on a tangential force;
 and it is perhaps not too much to assert, that under these cir
 cumstances the mean orbit cannot be a circle, and consequently
 that the eccentricity is not arbitrary.           Again, the process by
 which   I obtain the value of c appears to indicate that in suc
  ceeding approximations, this quantity will be a function of e
  and m. If so, it cannot be a function of m exclusively, unless
 the arbitrary constant C satisfy the condition Ch*=p.”.             It would
  be necessary, however, in order to settle these points, to complete

mineral yields up nearly the whole of            lime with effervescence  its

   “On the Nature of the Force by which Bodies are repelled from
the Poles of a Magnet; preceded by an Account of some Experi
ments on Molecular Influences.”—The Bakerian Lecture.    By John
Tyndall, Ph.D., F.R.S.
   The paper commences with an introduction, in which the present
aspect of the portions of science to which it refers is briefly sketched.
A section is devoted to the examination of the magnetic properties
of wood, which substance, the author finds, except where extraneous
impurities are present, to be always diamagnetic, and to set in the
magnetic field with               its

abnormal diamagnetic one.          The former, in the magnetic field, sets
equatorially, the latter axially.      The former sets parallel to an elec
tric  current,  the latter perpendicular    to the same.    If the deflection
of the former be from right to left, the deflection of the latter, under
like conditions, is from left to right. Finally, the position of equi
librium of the former is always at right angles to that of the latter.

º:                Straits of Gibraltar.—A current with a mean velocity of from
ºff<U+017F>.         three to six miles an hour usually flows through the Straits from the
it<U+017F>.          Atlantic into the Mediterranean.     A counter current is supposed to
              exist underneath, but the great depth of the Straits prevented the
              authors from reaching any such current with their dipping appa
              ratus.
#                East of the Straits the water of the Atlantic was met with in
}<U+017F>.           several places, in close proximity with water of the Mediterranean,
              from which it was distinguished by its temperature and colour. The
I.            stream from the Atlantic on passing the Straits seems to divide itself
              into several branches.
                In connexion with the variability of the currents in the Straits, it

       may be produced by this process.
           A little water of ammonia added to the hyposulphite bath brings
       out the picture more fully when a very short exposure is given.

       soda; if such be used in the process, it causes cloudiness.--From the

controverting the fundamental error according to which the elec

to be either without any action at all, or only to act in a certain
direction and within a certain distance.                     say only partially  I
succeeded; for although that fundamental error is no longer
nakedly and unmistakeably pronounced, yet a multitude of exam
ples show that it is still secretly entertained, and still manifests
 its prejudicial influence. The whole                 the following investiga

 404          M. P. Riess           on the Action        of Non-conducting           Bodies
       order to give certain and unequivocal results, the experi
       In

 ratus, which             I
                     will consequently describe at length.          Two
 metallic  discs,  insulated on glass pillars, were placed vertically
 on a table with their faces turned towards each other, and both
 parallel to the edge of the table at which the experimenter sat.
 The second or most distant plate was connected, by means of a
 wire 18 inches long, with a gold-leaf electroscope; and in finer
 experiments, with a dry-pile electroscope, and the first or nearest
disc was charged with positive electricity. The electroscope                                           in
dicated positive electricity, which was removed by uninsulation.

                                              if     the charged discof
was apparently strengthened, the electroscope again indicated
positive electricity;      the contrary,
                                    on      that induction was appa

avoid       all
           uncertainty about the result thus obtained, the electro
scope was uninsulated after the change        the induced electricity,

this change had been removed: here            indication       an

electricity proved that      the original experiment the induced

comes between the metallic discs, a diminution which will be dis
regarded in the following experiments; this experiment alone,
however, is necessarily at variance with the assumption, that
the induction of a charged metallic disc is stronger through
shell-lac than through air, inasmuch as no reason can be assigned
why a small piece of shell-lac should weaken an action which a
greater piece strengthens. The experiments described at the
end   of the present memoir will furnish the explanation               of this
remarkable phaenomenon.
   In order to operate with smaller intermediate plates, the large
metallic discs were replaced by smaller ones, 4.46 inches in dia
meter, at a distance of 1.65 inch from one another.               Here, how
ever, an important influence on the result of the experiment was
produced by changing the position of the clamp. On this account
the clamp was abandoned, and above the metallic discs a metallic
cylinder 3 inches long was fixed, in whose axis a metallic rod
could turn softly; this rod carried at one end a round nut for
adjustment, and at the other a clamp 1% inch long.                      With
respect to this clamp, a convenient arrangement may be here
noticed; one of          legs  its immoveable, and the other can

408        M. P. Riess on                 the      Action of Non-conducting Bodies
   From this it is manifest that intermediate plates of the same
non-conducting substance sometimes decreased, and sometimes
increased the induced electricity of the neutral sphere; and
further, by comparison with the former experiments, that one
and the same non-conducting plate, which increased the induced
electricity upon a neutral disc, decreased the same when the
neutral body was a sphere.       Hence the important theorem:-
   In eayeriments on induction, the effect of the action of non
conducting intermediate plates depends upon the form and dimen
sions, not only of those plates, but also of the conductor used in                                           the
eaperiment.     This theorem negatives,      the simplest manner, the
                                                                in
assumption that the intermediate plates directly influence the
induction        the originally charged conductor.

 posterior surface to surpass that of the negative electricity upon
 the anterior surface; sometimes, too, because the former is sup
ported by the action of the whole positive electricity on the cylin
 drical surface.  Here, therefore, the influence of the intermediate
plate will be alike in kind to that of the charged sphere, and the
induction of the latter will be apparently increased by introdu
cing the plate between the two spheres.        It is more difficult to
predict the effect upon the observed induction produced by inter
posing a disc of less extreme dimensions in comparison to the
distance between the two spheres, but after observation this
effect may be easily explained by the distribution of the electri
city upon the plate.
    In general broad thin intermediate discs apparently weaken,
and thick narrow discs apparently strengthen the inductive
effect of a charged sphere upon a neutral one.       Inasmuch as no
doubt can exist that the action of conducting plates depends
solely upon the induced electricities upon these plates, we must
conclude that the action of non-conducting intermediate plates
ought to be ascribed to the same cause.          It is certain that a
charged body induces both electricities upon the surfaces of the
most perfectly insulating body; and the following simple and
remarkable experiment will show that upon every one of the
interposed plates hitherto used, these electricities make their
appearance during the time of an observation.        The disc of
shell-lac 7:21 inches in diameter and 0.33 inch thick, or the disc
of paraffine 4.63 inches in diameter and # an inch thick, was
moved quickly to and fro between the flame of a spirit-lamp and
the knob of the conductor of an electric machine slightly charged
positively; the anterior surface of the disc approached within one
foot of the knob, and the posterior surface within one inch of the
flame.   By this means the anterior surface became         so   strongly
negatively electric as to impart a strong and durable divergence
to the gold leaves of the electroscope.   Here, during the moment
of passage, the positively charged  knob of the conductor imparted
negative electricity to the anterior surface of the plate, and posi
tive to the posterior, and the negative electricity alone remained
behind because the flame had withdrawn the positive. Conse
quently, in    all
                the induction experiments above described, each
insulating plate was undoubtedly provided with both electricities
                                                                      we or
at the moment when     it was interposed between the two discs
spheres; and     toexplain the different actions of  these plates,
have only  to  assume that these electricities occupied different
positions in space upon the thick and upon the thin plates.           If,
however, the action    of the insulating plates depends upon the
induced electricities on their surface,  it follows that their inter
position between the charged and neutral conductors         unessen

 I always    found that the induced electricity of the neutral sphere
 was   increased.    Consequently we can apparently change the
 induction of a charged body upon a neutral one in any manner
 we please, without introducing into the space between both,
 which is occupied by atmospheric air, either a conducting or a
 non-conducting body.
    The preceding research may be considered as demonstrating
 the following fact.        The inductive influence exercised by a
 charged body upon a neutral one is not changed by bringing
                                                                                                             of its

 decrease arises from two new inductions proceeding from the                                                 in

ductors and insulators.            conducting bodies the distribution                                        of
 the induced electricities depends solely upon the attracting and

tricity;    innon-conducting bodies the distribution depends not
only upon these forces, but also upon the resistance which the
substance opposes          the motion

If the conduction  on the surfaces of insulators did not make the
comparison a very precarious one, it would be interesting, with
a view to their classification, to compare the smallest dimensions
at which discs of different non-conducting substances percep
tibly diminish the influence of a certain body. Glass, mica, and
shell-lac conduct on the surface better than in the interior,
gutta-percha worse; and even when the greatest care is used in
the treatment of the plates, this conduction cannot be retained
sufficiently constant as to prevent the same plate at different
times from exercising a considerably different action.     The ex
amination of a plate, by using it as an interposed plate, is much
more delicate than                   its
                         direct examination      means      electro       by                of       an

414     Mr.   J.   Wilson's Researches into the Alum Manufacture.
Europe was imported from the East. In the fourteenth century
 an alum work was in operation at Rocca in Syria. There were
also several near Constantinople.  In 1459, Bartholomaeus Pernix
 or Perdix, a merchant of Genoa who had frequently been to Rocca,
discovered the mineral of alum in the island of Ischia, which
is situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Naples. About this
time Johannes de Castro, having visited the alum-works at Con
 stantinople, discovered the alum stone at Tolfa. It is said he
was led to this observation by the similarity of the trees at Tolfa
to those which he had seen growing upon the hills of Turkey;
and experiment showed the two minerals to be equally adapted
for preparing alum.
    At Viterbium the attempts made by the Genoese had great
success, and the manufacture increased greatly, especially as
Pope Pius the Second strictly forbade the use of oriental alum.
But the art did not remain within the bounds of Italy, in the
sixteenth century a work having been set up at Alcmaron near
 Carthagena. In Germany, in the year 1544, several existed ;
and in the time of Agricola there was an alum-work at Com
moton in Bohemia.       Bergman says that at this time (16th cen
 tury) the art had scarcely penetrated into Sweden.       The first
 alum-work in that country was founded in 1637 at Andrarum,
 where the alum shale is of great depth, being upwards of 360
feet.
   In   Queen Elizabeth's reign alum-making was introduced into
England by Sir Thomas Chaloner of Gisborough in Yorkshire.
It is said that he observed the trees in his neighbourhood tinged
with a peculiar colour, and suspecting that this was owing to
some aluminous mineral, caused a search to be made, the result
of which was the discovery of alum shale. It was towards the
end of the sixteenth century that his works were commenced;
and in a short time so great was their success, that sixteen works
of the same kind were soon established in the neighbourhood.
   Alum was first made in Scotland in the year 1766, by Messrs.
Lightbody and Co. at Hurlet, but their process was found to be
unprofitable, and abandoned in 1768–69; and it was not till the
year 1797, when works were erected at Hurlet by the late Charles
Macintosh of Campsie, and John Wilson of Hurlet, and their part
ners, that the manufacture of alum was successfully established.
In consequence of the success of the Hurlet works, the same Com
pany in the year 1808 commenced a larger work at Campsie,
where a shale similar to that at Hurlet is found in abundance.
   In the year 1820, the alum made in England and Scotland
                         six
amounted to from         seven thousand tons annually; namely
                         to
four thousand five hundred to five thousand five hundred            in
England, and fifteen hundred tons         in
                                        Scotland.        At
                                                       present

    Mr.   J. Wilson's    Researches into the Alum Manufacture.     415
 about seventeen thousand tons are made annually, of which
 twelve thousand tons are produced in England, and the rest in
 Scotland. The processes by which alum is produced from the
 shale or other material are different, as the composition of these
Varles.
     In the alum-works which were carried on formerly at Smyrna
 and Solfatara, and in other places where the ore contains a suf
 ficient amount of alkali to form alum without an additional
 quantity, the process is simple. The rock containing the ready
 formed alum is dissolved in a lead vessel and the solution cry
 stallized.
    At Tolfa, where the alum-stone contains an excess of alumina,
 the ore is calcined in order to render insoluble the excess of
 hydrate of alumina; to effect this, the stone is broken up into
 small pieces, which are carefully calcined till sulphurous fumes
 begin to be given off. Whenever this happens, the calcined
 stone is removed to stone cisterns, where it is moistened with
water; in a few days the calcined stones crack and swell, beco
ming like slacked quicklime.           After being thus moistened and
 exposed for some months, they are thrown into leaden boilers
 and boiled with water for about twenty-four hours, the water as
 it evaporates being replaced by the mother-liquor of a former
 crystallization. When the ore has been thus boiled for a suffi
 cient length of time the fire is extinguished, and the sediment
 having subsided, the clear liquor is run into wooden reservoirs,
 where it crystallizes; in these it remains about fourteen days,
the mother-liquor being used as described for dissolving the cal
cined ore.
    The alum obtained by this process is what is termed Roman
alum, and is considered the purest to be found in commerce.
 It frequently occurs in cubical crystals, and generally is coated
with a reddish-brown powder resembling ochre, but which is
said to contain no iron, being put on by the manufacturers to
give their alum the peculiar appearance which characterizes the
Italian salt.
    The alum made in this country is not obtained in this way,
 as neither potash nor sulphuric acid exist ready-formed in suffi
cient quantity in any of our shales, so that the processes adopted
are necessarily more complicated.
    The alum ore is an aluminous shale containing carbonaceous
matter, and diffused iron pyrites.          By the calcination of this
shale the    sulphur   is oxidized, and unites with the alumina, iron,
and other     bases, forming    sulphates.   By digesting the calcined
ore in water, and adding a salt of potash or ammonia to the
liquor, alum is obtained.
    At Hurlet the method formerly pursued was to leave the alum

tained must have been different from what     examined, as mag         I
nesia and no lime existed in these liquors.      The liquors are
pumped up from the cellars into wooden reservoirs, whence they
are allowed to flow into the evaporating boilers. These last are
about 60 feet long, 7 feet broad, and from 4 to 5 deep.    They
are arched over and are made of fire-bricks.   At one end is the
furnace, and at the other the chimney. The flame and hot air pass
over the liquor, and the draught carries off the steam as it rises.
During the evaporation, a brownish or buff-coloured substance
falls in considerable quantity, which is commonly called a                               sub
sulphate of alumina; but a specimen which         analysed   found         I         I
to contain upwards of 50 per cent. sulphuric acid, 25 of peroxide
of iron, and about 3 or 4 of alumina. When the liquor has
attained the strength 65° to 70° of Twaddel's hydrometer (1325
to 1350 spec. grav.), the boiler is opened and the liquor run
into the alum-coolers, which are made of stone. The proper
quantity of muriate of potash or sulphate of ammonia is added
either in solution or dry; if dry, the mixture is agitated by
wooden poles to cause the salt to dissolve and be equally diffused.
The coolers are left at rest for about a week, at the end of which
time the mother-liquors are made to flow into a tank for the
purpose, and the first crystals of alum collected and washed with
cold water.

   The first alum is dissolved in mother-liquor from the second
crystallization by means of steam. This operation is performed
in a cistern lined with brick about 9 feet deep, to the bottom of
which a steam-pipe passes. When the alum has dissolved, the
steam is shut   offand the deposit allowed   subside.  The liquorto
is run into stone coolers, where the second alum crystallizes.

Th;      polymagnet was devised for the purpose of exhibiting
       before a class of pupils as many as possible of the phae
momena of electro-magnetism     and diamagnetism.
   The instrument consists of an arrangement of two horseshoe
electro-magnets, a helix of covered copper wire disposed between
them, and suitable means of suspension.

    We will demonstrate this                            by       steps.          Beginning with the                         sta

the bifilar magnetometer is similar to that of the declinometer,
but with a retardation of three hours.
   Eaplanation.—A glance at Colonel Sabine's figures in the
second volume of the Hobarton Observations, plate 1, p. 5, for
the declination, and at plate 4, p. 43, for the component of the
bifilar magnetometer, will be sufficient to show, that while the
minimum of the declination occurs between 20h and 21", and
the maximum at about 2", the minimum of the bifilar magneto
meter occurs about 23*, and the maximum between 4" and 5*.
See also the figures in which this celebrated author makes the
comparison between Hobarton and Toronto in the first volume
of the Hobarton Observations.    At p. 34, plate 1, the curves of
the declination are shown; and at p. 54, plate 2, figs. 1 and 2,
that of the horizontal force; the perfect agreement of the
curves will be seen, (though the scales of the abscissae are differ
ent) and the same retardation between Hobarton and Toronto
which has been already remarked in the declinations.

to which cause each phase must be attributed. A few observa
tions, and those subject to some uncertainty, tend to show that
at St. Helena the annual variation of the inclination is small, so
that we must consider the variations of the horizontal force as
depending entirely on those of the total force.
   At Makerstoun the values of the horizontal component have
their maxima at the solstices, and their minima a little after the
equinoxes”.
   In general in this, as in the declimation, the months of April
and August are marked by the greatest diurnal excursions; this
is attributed by Mr. Broun to the extraordinary perturbations,
but it probably depends on some other cause. But for the prin
cipal details on the epochs of the maxima and minima, we must
refer to the original works, this memoir being already too long.
                      B. Vertical Component.
   This is given by the balance magnetometer arranged at right
angles to the magnetic meridian.   It follows laws analogous to
those of the horizontal force.   At St. Helena the curve has a
simple period, but with this difference from the curve shown by
the bifilar, that the curve of the horizontal force is nearly a
curve of cosines (reckoning from noon), and that of the vertical
force a curve of sines.     But the rudiments of a secondary period
are seen in a slight undulation, which it makes at about 10", as
also in the intervals of the intersection of the curve with the axis
being greater from midnight to noon than from noon to mid
night. The maximum occurs between 5h and 6", and the mi
nimum at 20°. Its amount is smaller from October to March,
during which period it is retarded, and greater from April to Sep

tember, when it is in advance.
   At the Cape of Good Hope the march of the vertical force is
so similar to that of the declination, that it is susceptible of the
same analyses and gives the same results.        In these curves the
diurnal period always predominates, though somewhat modified
in parts. See Sabine, Obs. Cape, p. 40, pl. 5. fig. 2.
   At Toronto and at Hobarton the usual antagonism displays
itself in this component.       The double period is developed as
much as in the declination, and the hours of minima and maxima
are almost identical with those of the declination.       The double
period displays itself at Hobarton in a somewhat singular man
ner, producing a maximum towards seven in the evening.

4.38        M. A. Secchi   on the Periodical Variations
malies  is to be found in the following remarks, viz. that as the
origin of the periods which are superposed depends on the dif
ferent hours at which the sun passes the magnetic meridian, the
semi-diurnal period has necessarily various positions with regard
to the diurnal; and in this manner various inflections occur
which it would be difficult to account for in any other way.
For instance, the variations of the inclination given at the Cape
of Good Hope, p. 44, pl. 6, can easily be decomposed by an ex
perienced eye into the usual principal periods, diurnal and semi
diurnal, which gain alternately on each other with varying para
meters in the different months.
   We may therefore finish this discussion with the following
general conclusion: that “the horizontal component, as well as
the vertical, may be decomposed into a diurnal and semi-diurnal
period, which depend on the declination of the sun and on the
geographical latitude.”
                 C. Inclination and Total Force.
   Given the laws of the variation of the two preceding compo
nents, that of the resultant or total force may easily be deduced;
and the absolute magnetic inclination being known, the variation
of the inclination may also be deduced from the variations of the
horizontal and vertical force.                        -
   General Law.—“The phases of the inclination are analogous
to those of the declination, but three hours earlier.”
   Eaplanation.—If the maximum of the declination is at 2h, the
maximum of the inclination would be at 23h or thereabouts.
This may be seen in the Makerstoun curves, &c., and also in the
Hobarton curves, the explanation of which we will give presently.
   As for the other peculiarities, it will be sufficient to remark,
without analysing each case in detail, that in general the maxima
of the horizontal force coincide with the minima of the inclina
tion.
   Colonel Sabine calls attention to the analogy that exists
between the variation of the inclination at Hobarton and Toronto,
places which are almost antipodal. In these localities the varia
tion of the inclination in both  its periods    the same
                                                 is          almost          at
precisely the same hours, with this difference only, that       Ho                at

   According to this distinguished writer, an analogous double
period is wanting at Hobarton, and the total force has a simple
progression with the minimum at 20° or 21", and the maximum
between 5h and 6*, the intermediate march being continued
without interruption.    But on carefully examining the curves

that the oscillation of the needle has always a double period,
diurnal and nocturnal, but their respective lengths vary with the
season.   The diurnal period, considerable in summer, is con
tracted in winter, and the nocturnal period, short and hardly
discernible in summer, is greatly developed in winter; in this
will be seen the fact, elsewhere noticed, that the absolute noc
turnal minimum is greater than the diurnal minimum, and
hence we see the cause of the error of those who consider that
there is a single period in winter.   But two things are particu
larly to be observed in these curves.   1st. The nocturnal loop is
always in diametical opposition to the point of noon; from this
it appears that the phases succeed each other near the lower
meridian with the same march as near the upper.

   From these facts we conclude that “a perfectly free needle
would describe during the day a species of double spiral pro
duced by a compound circular motion having two periods, the
one diurnal, and the other semi-diurnal; or of two periods, the
one while the sun is above the horizon, and the other while it is
below; the excursions of which are in the proportion that the
diurnal arcs bear to the nocturnal, and have for principal axis
the local magnetic meridian.”
   Lastly, there is a fundamental characteristic of     the prin                          all
cipal elementary periods, which consists        the mazimum and            in

or to the electricity developed in the meteorological changes of
which the sun is the principal cause.    A single reflection seems
to exclude these from being principal causes of the magnetic
diurnal period.     The characteristic fact, as we have already
noticed, is that the magnetic elements have a double period,
diurnal and nocturnal.
    Now temperature and the other causes suggested have a
 simple period, with greater or less modifications it is true, but
not so constantly repeated when the sun is below the horizon as
the magnetic period is in            climates and        allseasons. This                  in   all

observation.         It
                 may also be said that the small maxima in the
morning and evening, which are in truth for the most part only
indicated, are only a portion of the regular period cut short
midway by the discontinuity introduced by the passage of the
sun from above to below the horizon, as we have elsewhere re
marked in regard to the periods observed towards evening in
high latitudes *. For these reasons we have urged that a com
plete explanation of the phaenomenon depends on the law of the
distribution of magnetism on the globe.
   It may not be useless to state here what is habitually ob
served at Bombay, that being a place situated to the north of
the equator, and in a latitude not very dissimilar in amount to
St. Helena, the lat. being 18°53' 30" N.        From the observa
tions made at this      place and reduced   by  Mr. Montriou, an
oscillation results analogous to that of other countries; having
an eastern maximum a little before 8", and a minimum be
tween moon and 1 P.M.         Besides which, there are two other
small  oscillations, one near sunrise, the other near sunset; it is
evident that this is the nocturnal period interrupted by the                            in
terposition of the earth.     During the night the needle has a
very small oscillation. The horizontal force has a simple period,
but with disturbances which indicate the commencement of a
secondary period; the vertical force shows a tendency to a like
period. When the observations have been continued for a
greater number of years, more certain results will be obtained.
See Obs. Magn. and Meteor. at the Obs. of Bombay for the
year 1847, part 1. p. 493, and Plate 1.     The Editor of the
Bombay Observations then concludes:—“The presence of the
sun seems to produce great magnetic variations in the day-time,
and it is otherwise manifest that it is not on account of the
heat only of that body; for if this was the case, the curves of
the temperature would be similar to the magnetic curves.     Be
sides, the presence of the sun begins to be felt two hours before
sunrise, and lasts almost as long after sunset, so that the solar
magnetic influence appears to be quite independent of the tem
perature of the place.”
   But we are very far from denying that meteorological causes
may often affect the needle; we know that every meteorological
change is accompanied by a change more or less marked in the
vapour of the atmosphere, and therefore by a development of
electricity.  But when the needle is usually seen to complete
its regular oscillation tranquilly the midst   the most violent

storms, and during tempests loaded with electricity, with
tremendous thunder and lightning,     may well    asked, What
                                                      it                be

ever, appears to be proved by the fact, that in our climates the

agree with those of Mr. Broun at Makerstoun, as may be seen in
the results for 1846, p. 87, plate 1. The following are the re
sults with respect to the frequency and magnitude of the per
turbations in the different months of the year:—“The mean
value of a perturbation is a maximum in the equinoctial months,
less in the winter months, and a minimum in the summer
months.”     At Hobarton the difference between the summer and
the equinoctial months is scarcely perceptible. The proportions
of the frequency and of the magnitude of the perturbations in
each month, relatively to the sum of those observed in a year,
come out a minimum in the winter months, a maximum in the
equinoctial months, and intermediate in the summer months.
These conclusions, however, may be somewhat varied by the use
of different systems of reduction, depending chiefly on the de
finition of an extraordinary perturbation.    This is not the case
in the laws of the perturbations taken with reference to the day,
                             all          reduction bring out the
because in that case     the methods              is of
same result. Thus the same result        seen     the curves given

  But   a most singular fact, which has been discovered          these    in
researches,  isthe start which the mean annual values               the    of
perturbations take between the years 1845 and 1846, when they
are almost doubled. This being fact     a   the greatest importance,

that so     general a change in the march of      the magnetic ele           all

   We may be permitted to refer here to the hypothesis of Mairan
on the solar atmosphere, and on       relation   the zodiacal light  its                     to
and the aurora borealis, and therefore         the magnetic per                         to
turbations. We are far from admitting the theory            proved,                                              as
since   appears impossible
            it                 admit that the solar atmosphere

whence        rather
                 it   is  inferred that the zodiacal light depends
                                         to   be
 on   nebulous ring circulating round the sun between Venus and

cidences which may      deserving         be

of the aurora borealis and the epochs      the greater solar spots             of

450            M. A.     Secchi on the Periodical Variations
ing Mairan, one cannot help seeing the serious difficulty which
he finds in explaining why the auroras have their maximum
at the equinoxes, and not at the epochs at which the earth
passes through the nodes of the solar atmosphere; but do we
truly know the place of the nodes of the zodiacal light? He
assumes that they are the same as those of the solar equator,
but this is not proved; and if the zodiacal light constitutes a
ring, it might well be otherwise. On the magnetic hypothesis,
the greater frequency of the aurora at the epochs of the equi
noxes would have relation to the position of the poles of the sun
with reference to the earth, these poles being in fact more
directed towards the earth at the equinoxes, and being more or
less oblique to it at other times.
   Those who hold the theory of the production of electricity by
vapours, may say that these become rarefied in the morning
and condensed in the evening; and hence may arise opposite
electric states, the fluid passing in the morning from the earth
to the atmosphere, and in the evening from the atmosphere to
the earth.    This may be true; but why should this condensa
tion always   take place at nine in the evening? The hygrometric
curves of the different months show at all events a variation in
the hour of maximum according to the seasons.
    A hypothesis, however, can be found which would conciliate the
various facts, viz. that atmospheric changes may generate elec
tricity, but that the direction of the current, which of itself
would be indeterminate, may be determined by the magnetic
action of the sun. But to expand this further into a hypothesis
would be at present premature. We will only say that it is not
improbable that the earth is subject to the magnetic action of
the sun in a manner unknown to us; but now that magnetic
phaenomena are developing themselves under so many aspects,
we may hope that the explanation of these mysterious actions
will soon be found. Not only magnetism, but diamagnetism
also may cooperate, and still more the induced currents which
exist in bodies of every kind. Two things only I wish to notice.
First, the value assigned by Gauss to the magnetism of a cubic
metre of the earth”, is such as to make one believe that the
whole mass of the earth is really magnetic, and that this force
results not only from ferruginous substances, but from the whole
globe itself. #. proves, in fact, that the eighth part of a cubic
metre of the earth has a magnetic moment equal to that which
                                                               30

   3. The periods of the horizontal and vertical components, fol
lowing the law of the geographical latitude, and occurring at
hours wholly different from the variations of temperature, show
a different origin from these.        Therefore, if the coincidence in
time, in the variations of the temperature and declination, have
contributed to the belief of the existence between these two of a
mutual relation of cause and effect, the study of the other com
ponents makes this coincidence disappear, and therefore destroys
every foundation of the hypothesis.

  The powdered mineral absorbs 142 per cent. of moisture, and
before the blowpipe gives slight and but momentary evidences of
the presence of soda.
   Both of the above specimens are contaminated by an admix
ture of carbonate of lime, doubtless derived from the matrix,
which is limestone altered by heat.
   The table spar from this locality bears much resemblance to
the pectolite found on the Ayrshire coast, consisting of a vein of
diverging and interlacing white fibres.
   Seeing that table spar has been formed by the fusion of lime
and silica in a crucible, it is probable that the mineral may have
been formed in a similar manner, the granitic heat inducing the
combination of a siliceous vein with its calcareous matrix.

having been heated for one hour at 100°C.) the solution was
diluted with water, saturated with carbonate of barium and
filtered.   The filtrate, evaporated nearly to dryness on the water
bath, yielded a lemon-yellow crystalline powder, nitro-sulphoxy
lolate of barium; in quantity, however, too small to admit of an
attempt to isolate the acid, or to form from this barium com
pound other salts by double decomposition.          On ignition and
treatment of the residue with nitric and sulphuric acidst,-

           GENTLEMEN,
IN Magazine
   the year       1840 you were kind enough to insert in your
                  a paper, entitled “On the Direction and Mode
of   Propagation    of the Electric Force traversing Interposed
                                                I
Media,” in which memoir endeavoured to prove, from the ex
periments of Sir H. Davy, that an electric current consists in
alternate states of induction and equilibrium of the particles of
the medium conveying the current, the intensity of the current
being proportional to the rapidity of change of induction and
equilibrium, and consequently that the mass of oscillating aether
 surrounding the particles represents the quantity, while the
rapidity of the oscillations represents the intensity of an electric
Current.
    Your March Number contains some very interesting experi
ments which were made by Mr. Latimer Clark, on the transmis
 sion of currents of electricity of varying intensity through 768
miles of gutta-percha wire, indicating a velocity of propagation
of about 1000 miles in a second, which velocity is sensibly uni

which Dr. Draper calls the tithonic aether, which,                experiment              if
proves      to  the be
                     case,  should       more   correctly

    Dr. Draper,        the year 1847, undertook
                               in                          series     experi    a              of

 which he explains thus:—“As the luminous effects are undoubt
 edly owing to a vibratory movement executed by the molecules
 of the platinum, it seems from the foregoing considerations to
 follow, that the frequency of those vibrations increases with the
 temperature.”
    Sir David Brewster has observed, that in the spectra produced
 by the electric light the chemical rays are more numerous than
 in those produced by the lime light.
    The problem then to be solved                                 is,
                                             whether the chemical rays

THE“Micro-chemical
              communication was read:—
                   Researches on the Digestion           of Starch and
Amylaceous Foods.”      By Philip Burnard Ayres, M.D. Lond.
   After some general historical remarks on the methods hitherto
employed in the investigation of the complicated phaenomena of the
process of digestion, the comparatively small results obtained by
chemical analysis of the contents of the stomach, intestimal canal, and
of the evacuations, by Tiedemann and Gmelin, Berzelius, and others,
the author proceeded to demonstrate the necessity of a minute ex
amination of the contents of the alimentary canal by the microscope,
and such chemical tests as we possess for the determination of the
changes of such articles of food as exhibit definite structure.
   In order that we may ultimately arrive at a complete exposition
of the phaenomena of digestion, he is of opinion that it will be neces
sary to examine,—first, the structure of particular kinds of food,
then the changes produced in them by cooking, and lastly to trace
the changes they undergo at short intervals, through the alimentary
canal from the stomach to the rectum. The results of a series of
researches of this character on the changes in starch, and starch
containing foods, are presented in this memoir.
   The method adopted for the examination of the changes in starch
and starch-foods was as follows:–An animal was kept fasting
twenty-four hours, and afterwards confined to a diet consisting of
the starch or amylaceous food, with water, for five or six days, until
the debris of      all
                  other kinds     food previously taken were cleared
                                         of
from the alimentary canal. At        determinate time, after
                                              a                   meal,       a
the animal was killed, the abdomen laid open              as   quickly   as   possible,

and ligatures placed at short intervals on the intestinal canal, from
the pylorus to the rectum. The contents of the stomach and each
portion of the intestinal canal included between the ligatures were
then carefully examined. This mode of examination sufficed to
determine the changes which occur in the food during normal diges
tion; but other questions as to the particular secretion or secretions
by which the changes observed were effected.
    The fluids poured into the alimentary canal are five in number,-
the saliva, gastric juice, bile, pancreatic juice, and finally, the intes
tinal mucus.
    The influence of the saliva is easily determined, by chewing the
particular food subjected to experiment, and keeping the mixture at
about 98°Fahr.       The combined action of the saliva and gastric
juice is seen in the contents of the stomach. To determine the
 action of the bile, the common bile-duct was tied, and to ascertain
 the action of the intestinal mucus, it was necessary to ligature the
bile and pancreatic ducts.      If the digestion of the substance is not
 effected in the stomach, it is evident that it cannot be attributed to
 the saliva or gastric juice; if the digestion is still effected in the
intestinal canal after ligature of the bile-duct, it cannot be attributed
 to the action of the saliva, gastric juice or bile; if it still go on
 after ligature of the bile and pancreatic ducts, the digestive power
 must of necessity be referred to the action of the intestinal mucus,
provided no change has previously taken place in the stomach; but
 if the food passes unchanged after cutting off the supply of bile and
 pancreatic juice, but proceeds after ligature of the bile-duct alone,
 the act of digestion must be referred to the pancreatic juice.
     The author first briefly describes the structure of the starches and
 starch-containing vegetables employed in his experiments; then the
 changes produced by cooking, and finally enters on a minute descrip
 tion of the changes observed in the experiments he performed on
 normal digestion, and after cutting off the supply of bile and pan
 creatic juice.
     The correct appreciation of the structure of the starch-granule is
 of considerable importance in relation to these investigations, and
 the author believes that he has been able to afford a satisfactory
 solution of this vexed question. The changes observed during the
 digestion of starch favour the original opinion of Leuwenhoeck, that
 the starch-granule consists essentially of an investing membrane or
 cell-wall, enclosing an amorphous matter, the true starch, which
 strikes an intense blue colour with iodine; and these changes also
 support the opinion of Professor Quekett, that the concentric circles
  seen on the starch-granules of many plants are simple foldings of
 the investing membrane, leaving it still doubtful, however, whether
 these concentric circles are not in the starches of some plants com
 posed of linear series of dotted elevations or depressions of the     in
 vesting membrane.
     By these experiments it was determined that the concentric circles
 remain after the whole of the starch matter, colourable by iodine,
 was removed, and that even then the characteristic cross and colours

were still seen when the granules were viewed by polarized light,
although more feebly than before; this result being probably due
to the lessened power of refracting light, after the removal of the
starch matter.
   After describing the structure of the wheat-grain and flour, the
changes occurring in the wheat-starch during the manufacture of
bread are given in detail; but the most interesting of the changes
produced by cooking are those seen in the boiled or roasted potato
and in the boiled pea.
   In each of these the act of cooking, effects two purposes:–it
causes great enlargement and physical change of the starch-granules,
and dissolves the intimate adhesion of the starch-cells, which after
wards appear as ovoid or globular, slightly adherent bodies distended
by the swollen starch-granules, the outlines of which are indicated
by more or less irregular gyrate lines, produced by the mutual
compression of the starch-granules within an inelastic cell-mem
brane.
   The starch-granules of the pea possess a much thicker investing
membrane than those of the potato, which causes their outlines to
remain much more distinct after the removal of the true starch sub
stance during the process of digestion.     The other structures seen
in the pea are carefully described; the most curious among them
being the cells composing the external layer of the testa, which
bear so strong a resemblance to columnar epithelium of the intes
tine, that they might be mistaken for the latter by an inattentive
observer.
   The substances submitted to experiment were, 1, boiled wheat
starch; 2, wheaten bread; 3, uncooked tous les mois; 4, boiled
tous les mois; 5, boiled potato; 6, uncooked peas; 7, boiled peas;
8, boiled peas after ligature of the biie-duct; 9, boiled potatoes
after ligature of the bile and pancreatic ducts.   Several subsidiary
experiments were made to determine the action of the intestinal
mucus, the saliva, and the substance of the pancreas, on starch.
   The conclusions at which the author arrives from the experiments
are,
   1. That the starch-granule is composed of two parts, chemically
and   histologically   distinct,     a cell-membrane and homogeneous
contents.    The   markings     seen on many varieties of starch are re
ferred to folds or   markings    of the investing membrane.
   2. No    perceptible   change    occurs in the starch, whether raw or
cooked,   during   its  sojourn   in  the stomach    of  quadrupeds     the     or
ventriculus succenturiatus and gizzard          of birds;       all
                                                               the granules
preserve their perfect reaction with iodine and their pristine ap
pearance.                                                                   -
   3. The conversion     of   boiled starch into dextrine and glucose
chiefly effected  in  the first few inches  of   the small intestine, but            it is
continues    totake place  in a   less degree throughout the entire intes
tinal canal.                -
   4.   Inthe digestion  of   boiled wheat or   other starch,         or
                                                                   wheaten of
bread, the bulk   of the mass rapidly diminishes     in   its
                                                           passage through

462                           Royal Society.
 the small and large intestines, so that it ultimately yields only a
  small quantity of faecal matter.    After being deprived of their con
 tents, the membranes of the granules shrink and shrivel up into a
 minute granular matter, which constitutes the chief bulk of the
 faecal evacuations after an exclusive diet of starch food.
    5. The digestion of raw starch food (peas) in the pigeon or other
 granivorous birds goes on much more slowly, and progresses pretty
 equally throughout the entire intestinal canal. The starch-granules,
 whether free or included in cells, become intersected by radiating or
 irregular lines or fissures, more or less opaque or granular; they
 also gradually lose their characteristic reaction with iodine; and
 this important change, commencing at the surface, progresses
 towards the centre, until the whole of the starch matter is removed,
 leaving the starch-membranes often apparently whole, retaining
 their characteristic markings. The fissured and granular condition
 of the starch-granules is not due to their trituration in the gizzard,
 but to the action of the intestinal fluids, since it was often seen in
 granules enclosed in and protected by perfect starch-cells.        In the
 digestion of raw starch food, a considerable quantity always escapes
 change, for many starch-cells and granules in the faeces perfectly-
 retain the characteristic reaction with iodine.
    6. As the starch remains unchanged in the stomach, its conver
 sion into glucose cannot be attributed to the saliva or gastric juice,
 unless we suppose these fluids to remain inactive in the stomach,
 and suddenly to regain their activity in the first part of the small
 intestine.    The author found that the saliva was capable of effecting
 the conversion of starch into glucose, but that the mixture of saliva
 and gastric juice in the stomach did not possess that property even
 after being rendered alkaline by carbonate of soda. It is probable
that the converting power of the saliva, as it flows from the mouth,
 depends not on the true saliva, but on the buccal mucus; for Ma
 gendie found that saliva taken from the parotid duct was wholly
 inactive, while the mixed saliva from the mouth effected the conver
 sion with great facility. Unless, then, the sublingual and submax
illary glands secrete a different fluid from the parotids, it is evident
that the activity of the saliva must be attributed to the buccal
Inucus.
    7. The difference between the digestion of boiled and raw starch
in dogs is seen in the experiments on the digestion of boiled wheat
starch, boiled tous les mois, and bread. In all these, some starch
granules escape the action of heat and water, and remain in nearly
their pristine condition. These uncooked starch-granules undergo
slow and imperfect changes, being fissured, broken, and more or less
altered, but in general retaining their characteristic reaction with
iodine.
    8. The conversion of starch into glucose is not effected by the
bile, since after ligature of the common bile-duct, the changes occur
to as great an extent as when the bile passes freely into the intes
tinal canal.                                                             -
    9.  It is not due to the pancreatic juice, inasmuch as after ligature

                                                        -

         of the bile and pancreatic ducts in the same animal, the digestion of
         starch is still effected.
            10. The only remaining secretion is the intestinal mucus, which
         is especially abundant at the upper part of the intestinal canal; and
         a further proof is afforded of the activity of the intestinal mucus
         taken from the upper part of the duodenum above the entrance of
         the pancreatic duct after ligature of this duct and the common bile
         duct, by           its
                        capability     converting     large quantity

  by the muscular action of the parts or solution in the fluid, it tra
  verses the intestinal canal unchanged, except at the surface, which
  is then alone exposed to the action of the intestinal fluids.
      16. It is not necessary for the conversion of starch into glucose
  that the fluids in the duodenum or other parts of the intestinal
  canal should be alkaline, or even neutral, for in several of the expe
  riments the contents of every part of the alimentary canal had an
  acid reaction.
      17. The greater part of the intestinal mucus is not excremen
  titious, for little, if any, mucus is perceptible in the faeces in normal
  digestion, except at their surface, whereas the greater proportion of
  the contents of the small intestine consists of mucus. A consider
  able quantity of mucus is seen in the caecum, but it rapidly dimi
  nishes in the colon, and is scarcely detectible in the faeces, except
  that on the surface, which is probably derived from the mucous
  membrane of the rectum.        The author raises the question, whether
  one of the chief functions of the caecum is not to effect the conver
  sion of the intestinal mucus into some other substance capable of
  re-entering the blood, and performing some ulterior purpose in the
  animal economy.
      18. In normal digestion, the separation of the epithelium of the
 mucous membrane of the intestine is the exception instead of the rule,
 as stated by some physiologists.       The author questions the theory of
 the detachment of the epithelium of the villi in each act of absorp
 tion, on the grounds that the presence of detached epithelium was
 unfrequent in the whole course of his experiments; that epithelium
 is readily detached by manipulation; that the continual reproduc
 tion of such a vast amount of cell-tissue must necessarily be accom
 panied by a vast expenditure of vital force; and finally, that it is
 not necessary, because fluids readily penetrate epithelial mem.
 branes.
      19. The passage of a given food through the whole length of the
 intestinal canal may occupy a comparatively short time, especially
 when the animal is fasting.        In one experiment, where a pigeon
 refused food until the faeces contained no visible debris of previous
 food, starch-granules were detected in the faeces within two hours
 after a meal, and this although the intestine of this animal is ex
 tremely narrow and about a yard in length.
     20. A remarkable circumstance in the digestion of starch or
 starch foods is the constant presence of myriads of Vibriones in the
lower part of the intestinal canal. They are generally first observed
 in the lower part of the small intestine, as minute brilliant points,
just visible with a power of 600 diameters, in active move
ment. They increase in numbers towards the caecum, in which a
large number of fully-developed vibriones are constantly seen.
These minute organisms increase in size and length in the colon
and rectum, and their fissiparous mode of propagation, first described
by the author in the ‘Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science,’
may be distinctly traced by examining the contents of these por
tions of the intestine.

    “An Account of some recent Researches near Cairo, undertaken
with the view of throwing light upon the Geological History of the
Alluvial Land of Egypt.”—Part First. By Leonard Horner, Esq.,
F.R.S.S.L. & E., F.G.S.
   The author commences by observing, that although it be highly
improbable that we can ever form an appropriate estimate in years
of the age even of the most modern strata, we are not cut off
from all hope of being able to assign an amount in years to the
duration of some of the great geological changes which, in past
ages, the present surface of the earth has undergone, by causes
that are still in operation; especially by a careful study of the
formation of the deltas of great rivers, and of the action of the
latter on the rocks and soils they traverse in their course. If in
a country in which a certain alteration in the land has occurred, we
know that such alteration has taken place in part within historical
time, and if the entire change under consideration presents through
out a tolerable uniformity of character, we may be justified in
holding the portion that has taken place within the historical period
to afford a measure of the time occupied in the production of the
antecedent part of the same change.
   Egypt supplies us with the earliest evidence of the existence of
the human race recorded in works of art; in its monuments we find
the dawn of the historical period and of civilization; and that land
alone, of       all
               parts                    yet known       us, offers                                    an

ever was necessary to conduct the operations in the most complete
manner; and, with truly royal munificence, ordered that the whole
expense of them should be defrayed by his Treasury.          The author
never contemplated having the means of making these researches on
more than a very limited scale, but he had now the prospect, and it
has since been realized, of their being conducted on a very enlarged
plan.
    It has been often a subject of regret that experiments of this na
ture, of which the French had set an example half a century ago,
had not been followed up. On this subject the author remarks, that
the operations are of a nature that scarcely any individual traveller
could undertake; for they require a large body of men, some prac
tised in the art of surveying, and as they can only be carried on con
tinuously after the inundation waters have subsided for some time,
 and therefore at a season of the year when the heat is excessive,
 those only inured to the climate could stand the work.
    The place selected for commencing the operations was at the
 Obelisk of Heliopolis, about six miles below Cairo, the oldest known;
 erected, according to Lepsius, 2300 years before Christ. The au
 thor having given Hekekyan Bey full and minute directions as to
 the manner in which the researches were to be carried on, the ob
 servations to be made, the plans and reports to be drawn up, and
 the specimens of soils sunk through to be selected, the operations
 commenced in June 1851. Sixty men were employed under the
 direction of Hekekyan Bey, assisted by an officer of Artillery, and
 some young engineers from the Polytechnic School in Cairo.
    Nine pits or excavations were sunk at different distances around
 the obelisk, each down to the level of the filtration water from the
 Nile at that season, and as much under the surface of that water as
 was practicable.   The most important of these was one close to the
 obelisk.   The  upper  surface of the pedestal on which the obelisk
 rests, was reached at the depth of 5 feet 6 inches below the surface
 of the ground, Nile mud being accumulated to that height; the
 pedestal was 6 feet 10 inches in height, and it was found resting on
 two limestone flags, the upper 16 inches, the lower 15 inches in
 thickness, and this foundation was laid upon pure quartzose sand.
 This last was penetrated to the depth of 3 feet 2% inches below the
 lower layer of limestone.
    The author gives a section and description of each of the nine
 excavations.    But before doing so, he states that he obtained twenty
 eight specimens of soils sunk through in different parts of the Nile
 Valley, eleven of which were carefully analysed at the Royal College
 of Chemistry, under the superintendence of Dr. Hofmann.          A col
 lection of specimens, duplicates of which are in the possession of
 Hekekyan Bey, serve as a standard for the description in his reports
 of the soils passed through, to avoid the necessity of sending speci
 mens of identical alluvia.    These samples were carefully compared
 with the specimens analysed, and were found to resemble them
 closely in external characters.

   March 1, 1855.-Charles Wheatstone, Esq., V.P., in the Chair.

    “On the Structure, Functions, and Homology of the Manducatory
Organs in the Class Rotifera.”      By Philip Henry Gosse, A.L.S.
    In this paper the author institutes an examination of the mandu
catory organs in the class Rotifera, in order to show that the various
forms which they assume can all be reduced to a common type.
He further proposes to inquire what are the real homologues of
these organs in the other classes of animals, and what light we can
gather, from their structure, on the question of the zoological rank
of the Rotifera.
    After an investigation of the bibliography of the class from  Ehren
berg to the present time, in which the vagueness and inexactitude
 of our knowledge of these organs is shown, the author takes up,
 one by one, the various phases which they assume throughout the
 whole class; commencing with Brachionus, in which they appear in
 the highest state of development. Their form in this genus is there
 fore taken as the standard of comparison.
    The hemispherical bulb, which is so conspicuous in B. amphiceros,
 lying across the breast, and containing organs which work vigorously
 against each other, has long been recognized as an organ of mandu
 cation: it has been called the gizzard; but the author proposes to
 distinguish it by the term mastaw.       It is a trilobate muscular sac,
 with walls varying much in thickness, receiving at the anterior ex
 tremity the buccal funnel, and on the dorsal side giving exit to the
 aesophagus.
     Within this sac are placed two geniculate organs (the mallei),
 and a third on which they work (the incus). Each malleus consists
 of two parts (the manubrium and the uncus), united by a hinge-joint.
 The manubrium is a piece of irregular form, consisting of carinae of
 solid matter, enclosing three areas, which are filled with a more
 membranous substance.         The uncus consists of several slender
 pieces, more or less parallel, arranged like the teeth of a comb, or
 like the fingers of a hand.
     The incus consists of two rami, which are articulated by a com
 mon base to the extremity of a thin rod (the fulcrum), in such a way
 that they can open and close by proper muscles. The fingers of
 each uncus rest upon the corresponding ramus, to which they are

                           Royal Society.                          471
attached by an elastic ligament.     The mallei are moved to and fro
by distinct muscles, which the author describes in detail; and by
the action of these they approach and recede alternately; the rami
opening and shutting simultaneously, with a movement derived
partly from the action of the mallei, and partly from their own
proper muscles.
    All these organs have great solidity and density; and, from the
action of certain menstrua upon them, appear to be of calcareous
origin.
    The writer proceeds to describe the accessory organs.          The
ciliated disc has an infundibuliform centre, which commonly merges
into a tube before it enters the mastaw. The particles of food that
float in the water, or swimming animalcules, are whirled by the
ciliary vortex into this tube; and, being carried into the mastar, are
lodged upon the rami, between the two unci. These conjointly work
upon the food, which passes on towards the tips of the rami, and
enter the assophagus, which opens immediately beneath them.
   From this normal condition, the author traces the manducatory
organs through various modifications, in the genera Euchlanis,
Notommata aurita, N. clavulata, Anuraea, N. petromyzon, N. lacinulata,
Furcularia, N. gibba, Synchata, Polyarthra, Diglena, Eosphora,      Al
bertia, F. marina, Asplanchna, Mastigocerca, Monocerca, and Scaridium.
Some of these display peculiarities and aberrations highly curious.
Notwithstanding the anomalies and variations which occur, however,
the same type of structure is seen in all; and the modifications in
general may be considered as successive degenerations of the mallei,
and augmentations of the incus.
    The form of the manducatory organs, which occurs in Triarthra,
 Pompholya, Pterodina, CEcistes, Limnias, Melicerta, Conochilus, Me
galotrocha, Lacinularia, and Tubicolaria, is next examined.        The
organs are shown to be essentially the same as in the former type,
but somewhat disguised by the excessive dilatation of the mallei,
and by the soldering of the unci and the rami together, into two
masses, each of which approaches in figure to the quadrant of a
 sphere.
    Attention is then directed to what has been called (but by a mis
apprehension) the “stirrup-shaped” armature of the genera Rotifer,
Philodina, Actinurus, &c.    Here, however, the organs are proved to
have no essential diversity from the common type ; their analogy
with those last described being abundantly manifest, though they are
still further disguised by the obsolescence of the manubria.
   Floscularia and Stephanoceros, the most elegant, but the most
aberrant forms of Rotifera, close the series. The mastaa!, in these
genera, is wanting; and in the former genus the incus and the
manubria are reduced to extreme evanescence, though the two-fin
gered unci show, in their structure, relative position and action, the
true analogy of these organs.
   Having thus shown that there is but one model of structure, how
ever modified or disguised, in the manducatory organs of the Roti
fera, the author proceeds to the question of their homology.        He

 472                            Royal Society.
 argues on several grounds that they have no true affinity with the
 gastric teeth of the Crustacea, though he states his conviction
 that the Rotifera belong to the great Arthropodous division of
 animals.
     It is with the Insecta that the author seeks to ally these minute
 creatures; and, by a course of argument founded on the peculiarities
 of structure already detailed, he maintains the following identifica
 tions:—that the mastar is a true mouth; that the mallei are mandi
 bles; the manubria possibly representing the cheeks, into which they
 are articulated ; that the rami of the incus are maxillae; and that the
fulcrum represents the cardines soldered together.
     While the author maintains the connexion of Rotifera with
 Insecta, through these organs in their highest development, he
 suggests their affinity with Polyzoa, by the same organs at the
 opposite extremity of the scale, since the oval muscular bulbs in
 Bowerbankia, which approach and recede in their action on food,
 seem to represent the quadriglobular masses of Limnias and Rotifer,
 further degenerated.
     If this affinity be correctly indicated, the interesting fact is appa
 rent, that the Polyzoa present the point where the two great parallel
 divisions, Mollusca and Articulata, unite in their course towards
 the true Polypi.

     Prefatory to my volume on Cometic Orbits, published in 1852, I
  invited the attention of astronomers to the several points of resem

  Among these it was shown, that of the heliocentric longitudes of
  perihelia and ascending nodes of the then known planets and periodic
  comets, two-thirds were situated in the heliocentric semicircle
  between 315° and 135°. The planets stood thus in quadrants—

   We here perceive that  there are thirty L. P.'s situated in the helio
centric semicircle between 0° to 10° and 180° to 190°.         It is also
the fact, that there are thirty ascending nodes between 357° to 7°
and 177° to 187°, which may be called the same semicircle as that
in which the thirty L. P.'s are found.
   The quadrant containing the greatest number of L. P.'s of the
forty-one planets, is that between 10° and 100°=20.
   Those containing the greatest number of ascending nodes, are
                between 36 to 43 and 128 to 133=20
            and between 62 to 66 and 152 to 156=20.
   Surely there must be an undiscovered cause determining the
orbits in this way.    Having laid these facts before my first assistant
Mr.   Graham,   he computed    the degree of probability of such a law,
arguing thus:– “Were the nodes and perihelia indifferent to all
heliocentric longitudes, it would of course be an equal chance in
the case of a planet whose orbit had not been determined, in which
semicircle either would be found; and the d priori probability that,
of the forty-one known L. P.'s, thirty would be in one semicircle, is
about  gr;    and that of the forty ascending nodes, thirty-one would
be in one  semicircle, is about rººr. Thus the probability that there
is some influence causing a tendency to one semicircle, ascertained
from the facts before us, is very strong: for, for the L. P.'s, the odds
are about 660 to 1, and for the ascending nodes about 4430 to 1 in
favour of such a supposition.”     But after      mayall
                                                       it              be

great precision.   Amongst other results obtained, I may refer to the
fact that the relation of the attraction exerted by a magnet upon
oxygen, to the repulsion which takes place with the same volume of
water, is in proportion to the density of the gas, and that it may be
represented by 0.18 at a temperature of 53°6 F.
   Since the publication of these researches, Faraday” has given for
the comparative action exerted upon oxygen and water, ascertained
by another method, a number similar to mine. M. Matteuccit has
also indicated a method by which he has succeeded in arriving at a
number which differs but little; but M. Plückeri has arrived at dif
ferent results, by means of a balloon successively filled with oxygen
and empty, in contact with the armatures of an electro-magnet,
determining the weights necessary for the interruption of this con
tact.    If we reflect that the earth is surrounded by a mass of air
equivalent in weight to a stratum of mercury of 76 centimetres in
thickness, it is easy to understand that such a mass, subject to                                     in
cessant variations of temperature and pressure, must influence some
of the phaenomena dependent upon terrestrial magnetism. Thus, if
we calculate the magnetic power of this gaseous mass, we shall find
that it is equivalent to an immense iron plate of a little more than
one-tenth of a millim. in thickness, which would cover the whole
surface of the globe.         I have thought, therefore, that it would not
be uninteresting to examine afresh the action exerted upon oxygen,
air, and gases at different temperatures and at different pressures, so
as to determine their specific magnetism for different magnetic                                          in
 tensities.

   The results obtained lead to consequences of which the following
are the principal:—
    1. With an electro-magnet, of which the iron was 7 centimetres
in diameter (instead of 11 centimetres, as in the previous experi
ments), the repulsive action exerted upon bismuth, water, &c. does
not vary in proportion to the square of the intensity of the current
which circulates round the electro-magnet, except just at the inten
sity corresponding with 15 to 20 Bunsen's couples; with a larger
number of couples rising to 60, the relation between the action mea
sured by the balance and the square of the intensity diminishes in
proportion as this intensity becomes greater. The actions exerted
upon different substances at different magnetic intensities lead, with
some, to a specific magnetism, which varies with the magnetic                                                     in
tensity.
   2. Between the limits of intensity of currents of from 10 to 60
elements, the specific magnetism of oxygen compared with that of
water does not vary sensibly ºth of its value.    It is in the direct
ratio of the density of the gas.
   3. At 32°F., and a pressure of Om'76, the specific magnetism of
oxygen, compared with that of water, is on the average +0.1823.
   4. The action exercised by atmospheric air is measured by Hºndths
of the action of oxygen under the same circumstances of temperature
and pressure.
   5. The following numbers have been obtained to represent the
specific magnetism by volume of some solid and gaseous substances
at 32°F. and a pressure of 0”76, the intensity of the current being
comprised between 30 and 60 Bunsen's couples.

ON     THE ALTERATION OF THE VOLUME OF SOME SUBSTANCES                                                 BY
            HEATING AND FUSION.  BY HERMANN KOPP.
  Previous              investigations           have unmistakeably              shown     that there
is a certain connexion between the specific gravity and the che
mical constitution of bodies.        This applies particularly to fluid
bodies, as with these the influence of temperature upon the volume
of the substance could be easily ascertained. Certain rules also exist
with respect to solid bodies, when their specific volumes are compared.
    The author now publishes a series of experiments, the object of
which was to ascertain the volume of one substance in a solid and
fluid state; they also include the determination of the change of
volume undergone by some substances when heated or fused.            He
gives these results as facts which may serve hereafter for the expla
nation of the question, when similar observations have been made
upon a great number of bodies.
    The author describes his method of investigation as follows:—For
the determination of the expansion of solid bodies which are to be
fused in the course of the experiment, a fluid is required the expan
sion of which is known.       The methods of employing such a fluid
are  two,-namely,     1, thermometric,  in which the operation is per
formed in a thermometer-like apparatus, enclosing a solid body
together with a fluid of known expansion, in which case the expan
 sion of the solid body is found by deducting that of the fluid
from the whole; and 2, gravimetric, in which the specific gravity of
the body is compared in the fluid and solid states. The author
prefers the former method. The fluids employed were water for
phosphorus, wax, stearine and stearic acid; sulphuric acid for sul
phur; olive oil for chloride of calcium, phosphate of soda, hyposul
phite of soda, and the readily fusible metallic alloys; and         tur                     oil   of
pentine for ice.
    The results      the author's experiments are
                           of                            follows:–It              as                    is

some distance from it; the coefficient       expansion usually increases
                                                                 of
rapidly towards the melting-point.       Amongst the substances here
investigated,        only with phosphorus, and according
                         it   is                                     other                   to

stinctly towards the melting-point.
   The increase               of
                     volume exhibited                            by

LXVIII.      On the Optical Properties developed in Transparent
        Bodies by the action of Magnetism. By M. VERDET.

                                       PART     I.”
I     PROPOSE in this first investigation      to measure anew the
      rotations of the plane of polarization which are observed
when the direction of the luminous ray is parallel to that of the
magnetic forces, and to examine the laws according to which
these rotations depend on the distance and on the force of the
magnetic centres which act on the transparent bodies.
    Various difficulties present themselves on commencing this
investigation.    First, in the usual conditions of the experiments,
e.g. when the transparent body to be examined is placed between
the branches of the electro-magnet of M. Ruhmkorff, the various
points of the body cannot be regarded as subject to equal mag
netic influences.    Consequently the optical properties developed
by magnetism ought to vary from one point to another, and ob
servation can only exhibit the result of a number of unequal
actions.    A body of finite dimensions cannot be compared to a
body of infinitely small dimensions, which is the reverse of what
takes place in ordinary optical researches; hence the elementary
law of the phaenomena, that is to say, the only law which it is
of consequence to determine, cannot be immediately deduced
from these observations.
    Secondly, the optical properties developed in an elementary
slice of the transparent substance depend themselves on a very
complex combination of circumstances.        The electro-magnet                            is,
in   fact,   a   system   of   magnetic
                                centres whose distribution       not                  is
exactly known; the properties acquired                          by

482         M.       Werdet on the Optical Properties developed                               in
and on the quantities of free magnetism which are there accu
mulated; and the law to be determined is that which would be
observed if the magnetic action emanated from a single centre
whose distance and force could be made to vary.            As, in order
to exhibit the phaenomena     on a scale  sufficiently large for obser
vation, we are forced to place the transparent substance very
near the electro-magnet, we cannot assume that the action is
analogous to that of one or of two poles, according as the electro
magnet has one or two branches.
   We are ignorant also, in consequence of the complicated form
of the apparatus, of the position of the poles in the electro-magnet.
To remove the difficulties which arise from the inequality of the
optical action of different plates of the same transparent body,                                           I
thought it would be sufficient to use an artifice employed by
several authors, especially Mr. Faraday and M. Plücker, in the
study of diamagnetic attractions and repulsions.
   If we adapt to the two extremities of an electro-magnet two
large armatures of soft iron, which present, opposite each other,
two wide vertical faces, the space comprised between these ver
tical faces becomes, in Faraday’s words, a magnetic field of equal
intensity; i. e. a molecule of magnetic fluidº placed anywhere
in this space, excepting in the vicinity of     extremities,  sub     its                      is
            system
           to         actions whose resultant varies very little
                                                                                                         of in
mitted         a              of
magnitude and direction.                         In
                               fact, the two terminal surfaces
the armatures are charged with the greatest part         the free                         of
magnetic fluids (as experiment shows), and these fluids are
distributed almost uniformly, although with tendency         accu        a                     to
mulate towards the edges.
  If  we now conceive      magnetic molecule placed
                                   a                    the centre                      in

                                                                to

                account      the symmetry, the right line which
                                        of
unites the centres    the two terminal surfaces,
                             of                     the right line            i.   e.

of the armatures,    would approach the other;

Consequently, according                     as
                              certain actions became more intense
or  more inclined towards the line                              of
                                            the poles, others would
become less intense       less inclined. We can conceive, then,

         tioned, the resultant would remain almost constant in magnitude
         and direction. It is for experiment to show what case satisfies
         this condition,
             The accuracy of these observations is evidently in no respect
         subordinate to the particular law of magnetic action, which is
         the law of the square of the distance.              Consequently, without
         knowing the law according to which the optical properties of
         transparent substances develope themselves under the influence
         of magnetism, since we know that this law involves a variation
         with the distance, we may presume that, in placing a transparent
         substance between two armatures similar to those already men
------   tioned, compensations of the same kind will be established for
         the different points of the substance, and the several infinitely
         small plates of which we can conceive it formed, will                   acquire        all
         optical properties sensibly identical.            Experiment completely
         confirms this supposition.

 in order that the light might always pass through the same
 thickness; as long as I did not bring it in contact with one or
 the other armature, the tint of passage did not suffer any modi
 fication. The experiment succeeded as well with the other sub
 stances which         I
                   have used in my researches.
    Thus, in my apparatus, the space comprised between the two
 terminal armatures was so constituted, that a piece of transparent
 substance placed in any point of this space, excepting in the
 vicinity of the edges, was everywhere affected in the same manner.
 Hence the optical properties of the fragment were the same in
 all points       of       its
                      mass, and consequently they were the same
 (excepting the magnitude         the rotation) of  those         infinitely

the image on the diaphragm, two images could be seen through
the spar prism, and four through the Rochon prism, that is to
say, two principal images, and two secondary images due to the
imperfection of the construction.   Having conveniently chosen
the distance of the telescope and the diameter of the diaphragm,
it could be so arranged that only the image whose variations
were to be examined remained in the field of vision, an indispen
sable condition for the exactitude of the experiment.      took a                     I

    ºf     whose plane of polarization is much less deflected than the plane
           of polarization of the indigo rays, yet this smallness of deflection
           is more than compensated by the exactness with which the eye
           appreciates the variations of colour in the neighbourhood of the

           of the conditions peculiar to the phaenomena which I studied.
           The rotation of the planes of polarization of the different colours
           being always very small, their dispersion was very small also,
           and consequently when the analyser had a position convenient
           for completely extinguishing the mean yellow rays, it extinguished
           also in a great measure the other rays of the spectrum, so that
           the tint of passage was only produced by a very small part of
           the incident light.                  If,
                                    then, this light had not been extremely

488         M. Verdet   on the Optical Properties developed in
 to be measured had been feeble and incapable of altering the
 magnetic state of the needle; but the powerful electro-magnets
 necessary in my experiments would have considerably affected
 the magnetism of the needle, and the observations would not
 have been in any way comparable with one another.         Neither
 the tempering of the needle, nor the magnetization to saturation,
 would have been a sufficient guarantee, since the magnetic state
 of any needle whatever undergoes, as is well known, a temporary
 change when it is brought near a strong magnet.
    I tried, without much success, to use the action exerted by
 the  electro-magnet   on an unmagnetized body, magnetic or non
 magnetic.      Under the influence of an electro-magnet, a bar of
 a magnetic substance acquires a temporary magnetization ; and
 if the body has no coercive force, it is admitted that this mag
 netization is proportional to the magnetic action.      It follows
 hence, that the action exerted by the electro-magnet on the bar
 is proportional to the square of the magnetic action, and it only
 remains to measure it by known methods, i.e. by torsion or by
oscillation. If the body under treatment be diamagnetic, although.
 we do not know exactly in what manner the phaenomena occur,
it appears beyond doubt that a sort of polarity or temporary
magnetization is developed, and consequently we admit that the
 action exerted by the electro-magnet is again proportional to the
 square of the magnetic action.    Unfortunately in both cases the
law in    question is only an approximative one, sufficiently exact
when it is required, for instance, to correct the effect due to the
small variations on the power of an electro-magnet, but which
cannot be the basis of a satisfactory process, destined to measure
magnetic actions which vary between rather extended limits. In
magnetic substances there exists always a sensible coercive force
incompatible with so simple a law; in diamagnetic bodies no
indications of the existence of a coercive force have yet been
observed; but the only experiments we possess, in particular
those of M. Edmond Becquerel, merely give an approximative
law.    I  could therefore do nothing with this process, although
I  must admit that it might be useful in many cases: it might,
for instance, be employed in confirming the constancy of the
magnetic action in a given space, for this research is indepen
dent of the exact form of the law which represents the action of
an electro-magnet on a magnetic or diamagnetic bar.          In my
experiments, on the contrary, the knowledge of this law would
have been indispensable.

  - Consequently, if we conceive a system of circular conductors
constituting a helix whose dimensions do not exceed those of the
space where the magnetic action is constant, a rotation of 90
degrees round an axis perpendicular to the direction of the mag
netic action will develope an induced current proportional to the
magnetic action.                           If
                             the movement is made very rapidly, the
induced current can be measured without difficulty by the gal
vanometer, and the magnetic action will thus be determined”.

placement of the image of the scale observed in the small tele

increase without doubt the amplitude of the elongations, but we
 should fall into the inconvenience which makes the use of gal
vanometers with a single needle, such as the sine and tangent
 boussoles, so restricted.   The needle deviated by the impulse
 of a current, only rests again at the expiration of some minutes;
the least accidental cause would communicate to it a motion
which would be equally long in disappearing, so that the suc
cessive observations would necessarily be separated by a con
siderable interval.    On the contrary, in M. Weber's apparatus,

498       M. Verdet    on the  Optical Properties      developed   in
   We   see  from these tables that the magnetic action and the
rotation  may   vary in the relation of 1 to 3, and still remain pro
portional.    It is further to be remarked, that in each series of
experiments the magnetic action is made to vary in two ways;
by varying sometimes the intensity of the current, sometimes
the distance of the branches of the electro-magnet.              From 4 to
20 Bunsen’s elements were employed, and the distance between
the armatures was varied from 50 to 90 millims., so that the
distance from each of the armatures to the middle of the
transparent    substance might vary in the relation of 1 to 2.
In order to show that in both cases the law was the same, and
also to give an idea of the agreement in the individual observa
tions, of which the preceding tables only contain the mean,                 I
shall give here the experiments I. and VI. in detail.

    Each of these observations ought to be exact, as I have before
 said, to two or three minutes, and consequently the measure of
 the rotations does not allow a greater error than five or six
 minutes; the probable error of the measurement of magnetic
action is half a division of a scale. Although these errors are
so small, we may rest satisfied that they are sufficient to account
for the differences which exist between the several values of the
ratio of the rotation to the magnetic
                                   -    action

        It is
        important to notice, that the proportionality of the rota
tion and of the magnetic action is confirmed with the same ex
actitude whether the distance from the magnetic centres to the
transparent substance is changed, or whether the quantity of
free magnetism accumulated in these various centres suffers a
variation. This law of proportionality is demonstrated by our
 experiments         for

º                 Transparent Bodies by the action of Magnetism.                            501
-            M. Wiedemann has demonstrated that the rotatory power
          developed by the direct action of electric currents is proportional
          to the intensity of these currents. He has made no experiments
          on the influence exercised by the relative situation of the electric
          currents and of the transparent bodies; but if my results are
      !   compared with those of M. Wiedemann, if further, the general
          identity of the properties of magnets and of systems of closed
     :    currents be taken into account, it will appear evident that the
          rotatory power developed by a system of closed currents in an
 ºº ;     infinitely thin plate of a transparent substance ought to be pro
          portional to the action which the system would exercise on a
          molecule of magnetic fluid.

            I   find a complete contradiction to the law announced by M.
is        Bertin, according to which the rotation of the plane of polariza
          tion due to the influence of a single magnetic pole will decrease
          in geometric progression when the distance from the transparent
          substance to the pole increases in arithmetical progression. The
          explanation of this disagreement is not difficult to give. M. Bertin
          considers as pole, the terminal surface of soft iron of one of the
          branches of Ruhmkorff’s electro-magnet.            Now this surface
          could not be regarded as pole, at least if to this expression be
          attributed    itsprecise signification;          system
                                                            it   is   amagnetic     of
          centres distributed over      greata surface, and whose action cannot
          be  assimilated     to
                              that       single centre. We cannot then look
                                            of
                                             a

          polarization depend           on
                                     the distance from the     transparent  sub
          stance to   this polar surface; we can only find        empirical for
                                                                          an

          or even when we simply change the terminal armatures          the              of
          same electro-magnet.    But    the law which

a copper pedestal which rested upon four screws V, V, V", V",
so that it could turn around a vertical axis passing through the
middle of the transverse bar AB; the vernier C, moving upon
the surface of the graduated horizontal circle DE, indicated the
horizontal displacement of the system. On the upper horizontal
faces of the vertical branches two armatures of soft iron were
fixed, whose disposition will be easily understood from the figure.
Two prismatic pieces F and F' glided along two grooves G and G',
and could be fixed in any desired position by means of the screws
U and U'. At their extremities these two pieces carried two plates
of soft iron HK and H'K', each 0m.016 long, 0m.04 broad, and
0*005 thick. The two edges of these plates were exactly parallel,

parent substance, and afterwards analysed beyond the screen.
The direction of magnetic action was first brought into parallelism
with the direction of the rays of light, by making the zero of the
vernier C coincide with the zero of the graduated scale beneath
it; the transparent substance was next placed so that the faces
of entrance and exit were perpendicular to the same direction:
this was done by making the zero of the vernier on the plate O
coincide with the zero of the corresponding graduation; and
lastly, the optic phaenomenon was observed.        Afterwards, the
electro-magnet was turned through any angle whatever; this of
course caused the transparent substance to turn through an exactly
equal angle, but it was brought back to       primitive position      its                               by

rays, however, preserved      invariable  an
                                         direction,  and consequently
they always traversed the same thickness       transparent substance. of
The apparatus being thus disposed, the optical phaenomenon
was observed, care being taken        repeat each experiment twice

magnet, these two results were not sensibly different from one
another; when the angular displacement attained           exceeded 45                 or
degrees, the difference between the two results was greater than
the usual errors of observation.

 produced ; when these two rotations are perpendicular to one
 another, the rotation is zero; when the angle enclosed by both
 directions varies from 0° to 90°, the rotation decreases in a con
 tinuous manner.        This general fact once established,              that                                     all

   Now assuming, what I have no doubt to be the case, that
both the analyses are correct, how is the difference to be accounted
for ? Either that there is in the felspar of the mountains a great
diversity of constitution, or that the felspar selected by Professor
Galbraith was not similar to that composing the general mass
of the mountain.
   To enable him and the Society to judge as to the specimens
from which the analysis was made by Mr. Campbell, it accom
panies this paper; and any part not exceeding one-half is at the
disposal of the Professor if he wishes to examine                                   it.

           called Coercive Force.       By Professor PLücKER*.

 1.
                paramagnetic or diamagnetic induction in various
 substances is not proportional to the inducing force, but in each
particular substance, according to a peculiar law, approaches a
maximum which is the point of saturation of the substance.               I
have shown empirically, that for each of the substances examined
by me, the induced magnetism, after assuming the unit of indu
cing force, could be determined by means of two other constants
which are independent of each other. One of these constants              I
have named the constant         of induction, and   the other the constant
of    resistancet.     If it should be found that the constant of
resistance in     any  substance is zero, then for this substance the
induced magnetism would be proportional to the inducing force,
and the receptivity of the substance for magnetism would be
shown by the constant of induction alone. The induced mag
netism of the substances examined by me (nickel, cobalt, iron,
oxide of iron, oxide of nickel, bismuth, phosphorus, oxygen,
hydrated oxide of cobalt) always falls short, in different degrees,
of the proportionality mentioned; and the more so, the greater
is the constant of resistance.         The few observations made at the
time rendered it to me        probable   that for those substances which,
after the inducing force to which they were exposed had ceased
to act upon them, still retained a considerable portion of their
magnetism, the constant of resistance was comparatively small;
so that the magnetism of such substances, when the inducing
force is augmented, increases more quickly, and more slowly
approaches the point of saturation.           As far as regards hard steel
in   comparison    with   iron,  I could not doubt the correctness of

this conclusion. This was proved by a simple experiment which
I mentioned several years ago, and which showed that two bars,
a thick one of iron and a thin one of steel, formed into a cross
and suspended horizontally before the pole of a magnet, were
directed at a distance by the bar of iron, but near to the mag
net by the bar of steel. Numbers, however, were wanting which
I  could not obtain from this experiment.       The solid bodies
                                                                                    all

                                     the steel bars       were taken and E
carefully magnetized                in
                             different   degrees.    These bars were then

platinum which was moved along the arm                      lever.       of the

the bar     of medium magnetic strength, the same balance was

at by
   pouring dry sand out        small orifice upon the scale-pan
                                           of   a
  the opposite end                 of
                       the balance-beam.    The sand after each
determination was  weighed with another balance.      the third                      In
series    of   experiments,    the glass balance    Geissler had    of                              to   be
changed for      a    larger chemical balance; the determinations were

made in the same manner as in the second series, only that
weights were first laid on before the sand was added.
   In the last two series of weighings the large electro-magnet
was made use of; a very blunt cone, whose base was of the same
diameter as the electro-magnet, and whose point was rounded,
being placed upon the flat pole of the magnet.                  The buttons
were hung upon one of the arms of a common balance, and after
partially balancing the attraction by weights placed upon the
opposite scale-pan, the separation was finally effected by the ad
dition of small grains of shot.          The electro-magnet was at one
time excited by a single cell of Grove, and again by a battery of
six cells.

    Thus, for a Leyden phial; let us suppose a portion S of the
surface of a conductor A to be everywhere so near the surface of
a conductor A', that the distance between them at any point is
a small fraction of the radii of curvature of each surface in the
neighbourhood; and let 2 be the distance between them at a
particular position, P. Then, by the analogy with heat, it is
clear that if the two surfaces be kept at different electrical poten
tials, W and V', the potentials at equidistant points in any line
across from one to the other will be in arithmetical progression.

 uninsulated, would have had an electrical capacity equal to that
 of an ordinary Leyden battery of 8300 square feet of coated
 glass ºrd of an inch thick.

          “On Circumstances modifying the Action of Chemical Affi
nity.” By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S.
    The question intended to be solved in this communication is,-
what takes place when two binary compounds AB and CD are
brought      together under such circumstances that both they them
selves and the products of their mutual action remain free to react?
Do they, according to a generally received opinion, remain unaltered,
or, should the affinities so preponderate, become simply AB and
CB Or do A and C, according to Berthollet's view, divide them
selves in certain proportions between B and D, the said proportions
being determined not solely by the difference of energy in the affini
ties, but also by the difference of the quantities of the bodies? And,
supposing the latter to be the correct view, do the amounts of AD
and CB produced by the reaction, increase progressively with the
relative increase of AB, or do sudden transitions occur, such as
Bunsen and Debus have recently observed in certain cases where the
products were removed at once from the field of action ?
    A reply was sought in the colours produced upon mixing different
salts in aqueous solution.      There were not many coloured salts suit
able for the purpose, as it generally happens that a base gives the
same colour with whatever acid it is combined, and vice versd; but
the compounds of sesquioxide of iron were peculiarly adapted to
the requirements of the experiment, as some are intensely coloured
while others are nearly colourless.
   The circumstances that attended the formation of the blood-red
sulphocyanide were first fully examined.       On mixing known quan
tities of different ferric salts with known quantities of different sul
                                      &
        -

 phocyanides,    it was found that the whole of the iron was never con
  verted into the red salt; that the amount of it so converted depended
  on the nature both of the acid combined with the ferric oxide, and
  of the base combined with the sulphocyanogen; and that it mattered
  not how the bases and acids had been combined previous to their
  mixture, so long as the same quantities were brought together into
  solution.   The effect of mass was fully tried by mixing equivalent
  proportions of ferric salts and sulphocyanides, and then adding known
  amounts of either one or the other compound.         It was found that in
  either case the amount of red salt was increased; and that when the
  numbers of equivalents of the salt added were taken as abscissae,
 and the amounts of red sulphocyanide produced, as ordinates, the
  numbers observed in the experiments gave regular curves, though
  not belonging to the second order. The curves representing the
 experiments in which sulphocyanide of potassium was mixed with
 ferric nitrate, chloride, or sulphate, appeared to be the same, but
 hydrosulphocyanic acid gave a different curve. The deepest colour
  was given when nitrate of iron was mixed with the sulphocyanide,
  but even upon the admixture of one equivalent of the former with
 three of the latter, only 0, 194 equiv. of the intensely red ferric salt
  was formed, and when 375 equivalents of sulphocyanide of potassium
 had been added there was still a recognizable amount of nitrate of
 iron undecomposed. It was found that the addition of a colourless
 salt not only reduced the colour of a solution of ferric sulphocyanide,
 but also that the reduction increased in a regularly progressive ratio
 according to the mass of the salt.
     Other ferric salts were likewise examined. The black gallate gave
 results precisely analogous to those obtained by means of the sul
 phocyanide; the red meconate also confirmed Berthollet's views,
 but the action of mass was rendered obscure by the formation of
 double or of acid salts; the red pyromeconate resembled the meco
 nate; the red acetate bore similar testimony; the blue solution of
 the ferric ferrocyanide in oxalic acid gave results fully corroborative
of the influence both of the nature and of the mass of every sub
 stance present at the same time in the mixture; the purple and the
red comenamate afforded similar results; while the red bromide
 (not the oxybromide), though somewhat indistinct in          itstestimony,
 corroborated   to  a certain extent the preceding observations.
    Experiments were performed with          view
                                               a        to

 the mass of  water might have      the salts operated upon; its influence
                                    on
in   reducing the colour     ofthe ferric sulphocyanide was found     to   be
very great, but the nature         ofitcould not      exactly determined.

sulphocyanide had been produced,            could not affect the results

the preceding experiments.         Water did not appear       toact in   any
similar manner upon the other ferric salts.
    From the mass       quantitative observations made during the inves
                        of
tigation,it   was possible   to deduce not only the order     of affinity  of
the various acids for sesquioxide         of
                                          iron    compared with potash,

  position of some terms in the series, but hydrosulphocyanic acid
  certainly had the least affinity for ferric oxide in comparison with
  potash; it was represented by unity: the other acids followed in
  the order—nitric, 4; hydrochloric, 5; sulphuric, 7; gallic, 10;
  pyromeconic;     meconic;    acetic, 20; hydrobromic;      comenamic;
 citric, 100; hydroferrocyanic, 170.
     Other coloured salts were submitted to a more cursory investiga
  tion.   The scarlet bromide of gold when treated with an alkaline
  chloride gave a striking instance of the effect of mass in gradually
 overcoming a strong affinity.      The intensely red iodide of platinum
 afforded results which, though somewhat obscure, were not opposed
 in their testimony.    So did the blue sulphate of copper when treated
 with different chlorides. The “manganoso-manganic           oxide” dis
  solves in sulphuric or phosphoric acid of a red, and in other acids of
 a deep brown colour; and it was found that hydrochloric acid was
 capable of changing the colour of the sulphate according to its mass,
 while on the other hand sulphuric or phosphoric acid altered in like
 manner the tint of the chloride.     Somewhat similar results were ob
 tained by means of the green chloride and the purple fluoride of mo
 lybdenum; and the blue solution that forms when gallic acid is
 brought in contact with both the oxides of iron at once, bore testi
 mony to the same general laws.        The peculiar optical character of
 certain salts of quinine was also taken advantage of for deter
 mining what changes took place among the compounds in solu
 tion. The amount of fluorescence exhibited by a solution of acid
 sulphate of quinine was found to be affected by the admixture of a
 chloride, bromide, or iodide according to the nature and the mass of
 the salt added, and the addition of sulphuric, phosphoric, nitric and
 other acids was found to produce a fluorescence in solutions either
of hydrochlorate of quinine, or of sulphate which had been rendered
 non-fluorescent by hydrochloric acid.     Similar results were obtained
with quinidine; and somewhat analogous ones with the organic bases
contained in horse-chestnut bark, and in tincture of stramonium.
An experiment is also narrated showing that the same laws hold
good in respect to compound aethers as to salts having metallic
bases, alcohol being employed as the solvent.
     Beside the very diversified substances already mentioned in this
abstract, several others, such as lead, mercury, zinc, potash, soda,
baryta, lime, and ammonia, are shown by a more indirect proof to
enter into compounds which obey the same laws.          Hence it is con
cluded that what was observed in reference to the ferric salts holds
good very generally, if not universally.
    The bearing of certain other phaenomena upon the question at
issue was also examined.       The fact that precipitation, when it oc
curs, gives rise to a perfect interchange of bases and acids, is equally
consistent with either Bergmann's or Berthollet's theory; but not
so is the fact that two soluble salts cannot be mixed without the
occurrence of precipitation, if one of the products that may be formed
is an insoluble salt. The only recorded exception to this law, which
occurs with oxalate of iron in the presence of a salt of yttria, under
peculiar circumstances, was found on close examination to be in

                           -

 perfect accordance with the principles laid down by Berthollet.
 Besides the argument founded on this universal fact, several expe
 riments were devised for the purpose of proving that the complete
 precipitation of an insoluble salt on the mixing of two soluble salts,
 was due to the insoluble compound being removed at once out of the
 field of action on the first distribution of the elements, thus neces
 sitating a redivision, and so on until no more of it could possibly be
 formed.     The phaenomena attending volatilization have the same
 bearing as those connected with precipitation.             If by the mutual
 action of two salts a substance be formed, which, though soluble in
 water, requires more water for its solution than is present, it crystal
lizes out : certain experiments were noted where this action occurs,
 and it was found that they gave testimony in favour of the same
views as have been supported by the preceding observations.                The
bearing of the phaenomenon of diffusion of salts upon the point at
issue was also examined: Malaguti's experiments were discussed;
and they, as well as some observations on the solution of certain
bodies by others set at liberty, were found to bear testimony also in
the same direction.
    During the whole of the experiments on this subject, most of
which were performed quantitatively, no unequivocal instance oc
curred of two substances having so strong an affinity for one another,
that they combined to the exclusion of other bodies of like kind pre
sent in the same solution.        After showing that some reputed excep
tions are really not capable of being proved to be so, and after sug
gesting some probable limitations of the action of the general law,
the paper concludes with the following deductions:—
    I. That where two or more binary compounds are mixed under
such circumstances that             all
                                  the resulting compounds are free          act        to
and react, each electro-positive element enters into combination
with each electro-negative element             certain constant proportions.
                                                    in
    II. That these proportions are independent                          of

   This compound, whose existence was mentioned in a previous
memoir”, is formed by the action of zinc upon iodide of ethyle, or a
mixture of iodide of ethyle and anhydrous ether, at a temperature ex
ceeding 100°C.      The materials are enclosed in a copper digester
capable of resisting great pressure.    When purified by rectification
in an  atmosphere  of carbonic acid, zincethyle possesses the following
properties:—At ordinary temperatures it is a colourless, transparent
and mobile liquid, refracting light strongly and possessing a peculiar
odour, rather pleasant than otherwise, and therefore differing greatly
from that of zincmethyle.    Its specific gravity is 1-182 at 18°C.
Exposed to a cold of –22°C. it exhibits no tendency to become
solid. Zincethyle boils at 118°C., and distils unchanged. The spe

oxygen.      This reaction, which is also common to zincmethyle and
zincamyle, led me to suppose that, like cacodyle, these bodies com
bined directly with oxygen; but the results of a closer study of the
action of oxygen upon zincethyle prove that no such compound is
formed; the white body being ethylate of zinc, and containing no
organo-metallic compound, in the strict sense of the term. The
action of oxygen upon zincethyle is expressed in the following equa

    Zincethyle is acted upon with great energy by iodine ; when the
violence of the reaction is moderated, by the application of intense
cold and the intervention of ether, the sole products are iodide of
zinc and iodide of ethyle—

    Bromine acts with explosive violence on zincethyle, but the action
may be moderated by adding the bromine in the form of diffused
vapour and cooling to 0°C.           The sole products of the reaction are
then bromide of ethyle and bromide of zinc–

    Zincethyle burns with a lurid flame spontaneously in chlorine gas;
the zinc and hydrogen are converted into chlorides, whilst carbon is
deposited in the form of soot. I have not studied the products of a
more moderate action, as it is difficult to bring the materials toge
ther without too great an elevation of temperature. There can be
no doubt, however, that the moderated action of chlorine would be
analogous to that of bromine or iodine, and that the products would
be chloride of ethyle and chloride of zinc–

    Carefully dried flowers of sulphur have only a slight action upon
an ethereal solution of zincethyle, but the application of a gentle
heat suffices to produce a brisk reaction; the sulphur gradually dis
 appears, a white flocculent precipitate is formed, and a strong odour
of sulphide of ethyle developed. The chief product of this reaction
is the double sulphide of ethyle and zinc (mercaptide of zinc), which
 is produced as follows:—

   It is also similarly acted upon by the hydrated acids and by the hy
drogen compounds of chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine and sulphur.
   The behaviour of zincethyle in contact with the electro-negative
elements is highly remarkable, and cannot fail to have an important
influence upon our views of the condition of bodies at the moment of
chemical change,_a subject so ably discussed by Brodie”, whose in
genious views I consider to receive a new support in these reactions
of zincethyle, by the singular way in which ethyle, a body low down
in the electro-positive series, unites with oxygen, chlorine, &c., in
the presence of a large excess of the intensely electro-positive zinc
ethyle.     This behaviour also strikingly confirms the suggestions I
ventured to make in my former memoirt, relative to the moleculo
symmetrical form of organo-metallic compounds.          In the inorganic
combinations of zinc, this metal unites with one atom only of other
elements; a very unstable peroxide, not hitherto isolated, being the
only exception.     The atom of zinc appears, therefore, to have only
one point of attraction, and hence, notwithstanding the intense
affinities of         its
                 compound with ethyle, any union with       second body                                    a

Bay, specimens of Macgillivraya, Cheletropis, and a few other genera
of minute pelagic Gasteropoda, apparently undescribed, were daily
taken in the towing-net, and afforded him an opportunity of more
precisely determining the mode of attachment of the ciliated arms
                                                                                                       -
which he had at first presumed to be naked branchiae.
   In his former paper* it was stated, more particularly of Cheletropis
Hurleyi, that the gills were of two kinds, viz. “covered ” and
“naked ;” the former, corresponding to those of the pectinibran
chiate Gasteropoda generally, he has never found to be absent in
any of the genera; but from further observation of the so-called
naked gills, while the animals were alive in their native element, he is
disposed to think that they are chiefly employed for prehension, and
probably as auxiliary organs of natation.        When these ciliated
appendages are fully extended, the line of cilia is perfectly straight,
so that the frilled border, noticed in the previous account, turns out
to be a character depending simply on the partial contraction of the
longitudinal muscular fibres, preparatory to complete retraction of
the organs. They have no connexion with the mantle, but encircle
the mouth together with the tentacula and eyes, and coalesce at their
bases like the segments of a deeply-cleft calyx.    In the specimens of
Macgillivraya examined the arms were quite transparent, but marked
at irregular intervals with cross streaks of brownish purple.    In the
extended state they were several times the length of the shell, and,
like the arms of a polype, they rolled themselves up when touched,
and started back into the shell with surprising rapidity.     They ap
peared also to be exquisitely sensitive, exhibiting short twitching
movements when minute particles suspended in the water came in
contact with them.

indefinite range. As regards both animal and shell, it in many
points resembles a miniature Natica. The shell is few-whorled, with
small compressed spire and ventricose mouth; the operculum pauci
spiral and well-marked with the lines of growth.    The foot is not
unlike a broad and square-toed shoe in form, receiving or bearing
the remainder of the animal and the shell.  The shoe-upper, as it

by the septum, and the liquid B, which attracts it with a force su
perior to that exercised between the molecules of A, there is no reason
why the movement should not take place as well in one direction as
the other.
   At the moment when the pores of the septum are charged with
the liquid A, and if the passage of the liquid threads A towards the
liquid B is considered to be more rapid than the passage of B towards
the liquid threads A, on account of the smaller mass of A, it follows
that when the septum is charged with the liquid B, the threads will
be attracted by the mass of A, and the movement will take place in
a contrary direction.
   Dutrochet and Mr. Graham have pointed out, in opposition to
this theory, that the elevation of liquids in capillary tubes is very
slight compared with the height of the columns of liquid supported
by endosmose; but these observers do not appear to have taken
into account the circumstance that, in reality, the height of the
liquid in ordinary tubes indicates merely the action of the liquid
upon itself.   This is proved by the circumstance, that the liquid
column is always the same height in tubes of equal diameter, and
made of any substance that is wetted by the liquid, as if the
layer of liquid nearest to the surface of the tube were the seat of the
action; whereas the capillary force essential in endosmose results
from the action of the solid substance on the liquid.
   In order that this may produce its greatest effect, the diameter of
the tubes must not be more than double the distance at which the
attraction is exercised; and in ordinary capillary tubes the conditions
requisite for the production of an appreciable osmotic motion are far
from being fulfilled.
   The only weak point of Poisson's theory, so far at least as regards
the porous septum, consists in the disregard of the elective action of
the solid substance just at the point where its consideration becomes
necessary. When the surfaces of the septum are in contact with two
liquids which are miscible, one being more strongly attracted by the
substance of the septum than the other, there would at the moment of
contact between the liquids be an expulsion of one by the other, and
a consequent motion which would cease so soon as the liquid was in
contact with the septum throughout                    its
                                         entire extent.
   Porous clay vessels have channels whose minuteness          evident                is
from the slowness with which water passes through them, never
theless they are inferior    liquids
                                to     the osmotic faculty. There
                                                 in                                           is

   If the wires of the pole (which should be rather thick) be placed
about five millimetres apart, and the intervening space be blown upon
rather strongly with a bellows, the greenish-yellow atmosphere is
seen to be drawn towards the opposite side, where it forms a large
flame of a violet colour.   It may also be blown along the wires of
the  pole, and it is then seen to be furrowed by a number of very
sinuous, more or less white jets of fire, which are usually disposed
in strata.    The violet light appears to be circumscribed by two
bundles of violet rays, which rise from the points of the poles and
unite in irregular curves, like those of a flame driven by the wind.
The true spark does not appear to be affected by the current of air.

          ON COMPLEMENTARY           COLOURS.    BY H. MEYER.
    Without going into the consideration of the proposed explana
 tions of the complementary colours, I give a few experiments by
 which the observation of these subjective colours is much facilitated,
 reserving a further consideration of these phaenomena, and the con
 clusions to be drawn from them, for a subsequent memoir.                         -
    If a narrow strip of gray paper be laid upon a coloured surface,
 this strip appears tinged with the complementary colour of the body
 on which it is lying. This experiment does not, however, always
 succeed equally well, and is best performed with a green surface; if
 the strip of paper be white and a little broader, the complementary
colour is only observed after long watching, or perhaps not at all.
The complementary colour may, however, be produced immediately
and quite distinctly, even with white strips of such breadth, that,
 without further assistance, they cannot show the complementary
colour (several inches broad) by laying a leaf of fine, transparent
writing-paper over the coloured surface and white paper. The white
strip immediately appears covered with a tolerably uniform paletinge
of the complementary colour.
    A sheet of coloured paper laid beside one of white paper does not
allow the complementary colour to be observed upon the latter; and
it is only when the coloured sheet has been looked at for some time,
and the eyes are then alternately directed from the coloured surface
to the white, that the strip of the latter lying next to the coloured
surface is tinged with a somewhat intense complementary colour.
But if a transparent sheet of writing-paper be laid over the coloured
and white surfaces, the complementary colour immediately makes              its
appearance upon the latter, without any previous removal              of
                                                                   the eye
from one surface     tothe other.    If
                                      the  eye      be
                                                  directed    thetomargin
of  the white and coloured surfaces, the portion         of
                                                       the white surface
lying next to  the coloured surface appears more intensely tinged with
the complementary colour than the parts lying           greater distance;
