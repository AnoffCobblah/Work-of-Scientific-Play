                                       electric currents are produced
                                       pieces of metal are connected
with a galvanometer and their free ends simultaneously immersed
 in two parts of a conducting liquid of different temperatures, or
 when they are immersed in a conducting liquid of uniform tem
 perature, and one of the pieces maintained at a different tempe
 rature from the other; and the currents so produced have been
 ascribed sometimes to chemical causes, and sometimes to the
ordinary thermo-electric properties of the metals.
    2. In order to ascertain more clearly the conditions under
 which those currents are developed, I have been induced to make
 some experiments upon the subject.            The earliest questions
which occurred to my mind were,          1st, Are the currents in such
 cases due, or partly due, to any thermo-electric properties of the
liquids similar to those of single metals? 2ndly, Are they due, or
partly due, to the usual thermo-electric property of the metals
 employed? or 3rdly, Are they due, or partly due, to chemical
 action developed at the surfaces of mutual contact of the metal
 and liquid by the application of heat 7

    3. We know that if two pieces of copper, or any other kind
of metal, are taken and connected with a galvanometer, and the
free extremity of one of the pieces is heated and then suddenly
applied to the free and cold end of the other, a feeble current of

Each of the two vessels contained about 12 ounces by measure

prepared, so that there was no interfering current produced by
difference of chemical action of the liquid upon them, or by dif
ference of smoothness of their surfaces.      The galvanometer was
an astatic one (or  very nearly  so), with  very fine silk suspending
fibre (I have found a fine  platinum   suspending   wire insufficiently
sensitive);       its
                coil contained about 200 turns        moderately fine        of
copper wire (exact diameter 0.0075 inch), and offered             inju                      no

used to convey steam into the water.    The cistern is provided
with a moveable half-lid of metal to admit of the insertion of a

water.

must now be passed into the water, and as soon as the tempera
ture of the water and upper plate begins to rise, and the needles
of the galvanometer to be deflected, the direction of the deflections
must be noted every few minutes until the temperature of the
water reaches 205° or 210°F.       If a verification of the result is
required, the water may be allowed to cool gradually, and the
deflections noted as it cools, or what is much better, the experi
ment may be wholly repeated.       The current of steam should be
of such an amount as to raise the temperature of the water from
60° to 210° F. in two and a half or three minutes.
    15. The time required to make a single examination of a
liquid varies from ten minutes to half an hour, according to the
facility of manipulation; liquids which act strongly upon the
washers or plates, such as strong acids or alkalies, or those which
exhibit irregular phaenomena, require much longer time, and
need several examinations to verify the result.
    16. Many precautions are necessary to be observed in the
construction and use of the apparatus in order to exclude every
interfering circumstance; the washers should be of such a nature
 as not to act chemically upon the metal plates; they should also
 not give way and be forced out by the combined influence of the
 heat and pressure; vulcanized india-rubber washers, covered
 with a thin sheet of ordinary india-rubber on the side next the
 plates by means of a solution of india-rubber in bisulphide of
 carbon, answer admirably after having been used a few times;
 or vulcanized india-rubber ones alone succeed well with some
 metals after much use, but not in examining strong nitric acid,
 because of        its
                action upon them. The only washers have found             I
     withstand this liquid with the heat and pressure, were formed

washers soaked      shell-lac varnish and dried, succeed for
                          in                                      few                 a

material the washers may        composed, they should
                                              be            perfectly           be

of an ounce of pure sulphuric acid, boiled the mixture in a glass

of a secondary  character with regard to heat, being results of the
chemical action produced (or permitted) by the heat.
   39. That the currents are not due to secondary chemical action
is also evident; for if they were, they would increase in quantity
with every increase of the primary chemical action, which is not
found to be the case, but the reverse; the greater the amount
of chemical action in certain cases, the weaker are the results.

    53. Sulphate of Ammonia.-4 ounces of distilled water and
100 grains of sulphate of ammonia, solution pre-boiled; hot
metal negative.       Retried after absorption of some atmospheric

 Retried with distilled water and the solution pre-boiled; hot
 metal was feebly negative below 200°F.,-above that, feebly
 positive. Tried the same liquid after absorption of some atmo
 spheric air; the hot metal was then feebly negative, increasingly
 to 180° F., then decreasingly to 208°F.                  I

  100 grains      of anhydrous potash dissolved               solution pre

in greater degree. Weak alkaline reaction with test-paper.
    59. Sulphate of Potash.-4 ounces of distilled water and 100
grains of sulphate of potash, liquid pre-boiled; hot metal posi

a less degree.     Liquid exhibited neutral reaction with test-paper.
    60. Chlorate of Potash.-4 ounces of spring water and 100
grains of chlorate of potash; hot metal feebly negative.        Retried
with    liquid pre-boiled;  hot metal  again  feebly  negative.   Tried
again with distilled water and solution pre-boiled; hot metal
feebly positive. Allowed the latter solution to absorb some air;
the hot metal was still positive, but in a less degree.      The liquid
gave a very faint acid reaction with     litmus-paper.     In this case,
as in that of hydrochlorate of ammonia (54), the impurities of
spring water evidently interfered and reversed the electric rela
tions of the plates.
    61. Nitrate of Potash.-4 ounces of spring water and 100
grains of nitrate of potash; hot metal positive.          Retried with

 100 grains of cyanide of potassium, liquid pre-boiled; hot metal
 strongly positive. Retried the liquid after it had absorbed some
 air; same result. Strongly alkaline reaction with litmus-paper.
 Probably chemical action contributed towards the strength of this
 result.
    63. Tartrate of Potash.-4 ounces of distilled water and 100
 grains of tartrate of potash, liquid pre-boiled; hot metal positive.
 Retried after it had absorbed some air; same result. Weak
 alkaline reaction.

 rated at 63°F. with bitartrate of potash, liquid pre-boiled; hot
 metal negative.     Retried after exposure to the atmosphere a few
 hours; same result. Acid reaction with litmus-paper.

p aper.

        Microcosmic Salt.—4 ounces of distilled water and 100

of strontium, nitrate of strontia, chloride of calcium, sulphate of
magnesia, and chloride of magnesium, were also similarly prepared,
and each examined several times; and the results obtained,
although uniform, and confirmatory of          all
                                           previous ones, were          so

with litmus-paper.    Retried with distilled water, and the solu

                    Copper.—5 ounces        spring water and 110

    by the Immersion   of unequally  Heated Metals in Liquids.      17
with the liquid pre-boiled; same result. Added 1 drachm of
pure sulphuric acid to this solution and retried; same result,
but in a very much greater degree.          Same solution pre-boiled
gave similar results. Tried again with 4 ounces of distilled
water and 100 grains of the salt pre-boiled; same result.
    79. Nitrate of Copper.—5 ounces of spring water and 110
grains of nitrate of copper; hot metal negative.         Retried with
the liquid pre-boiled; same result.       Acid reaction.
    80. According to these results, hot platinum is negative to
cold platinum in the following liquids:–moderately dilute
aqueous solutions of boracic, phosphoric, sulphuric, hydrochloric,
nitric, oxalic, acetic, tartaric, and citric acids. Also in aqueous
solutions of the following salts:—sulphate, hydrochlorate, and
nitrate of ammonia, sulphate of soda, sulphate of alumina, sul
phate of zinc, sulphate of copper, sulphate of copper acidulated
with sulphuric acid, and nitrate of copper.        And hot platinum
is positive to cold platinum in aqueous solutions of ammonia,
carbonate of ammonia, potash, carbonate, sulphite, sulphate,
chlorate, and nitrate of potash, cyanide of potassium, soda, car
bonate, biborate, diphosphate, and hyposulphite of soda, chloride
of sodium, nitrate of soda, and microcosmic salt.
    81. In every case (provided chemical action was completely or
sufficiently excluded) where the liquid was strongly acid to test
paper, hot platinum was decidedly negative to cold platinum;
and in every case where the solution was strongly alkaline, it
was as decidedly positive.      Also in every case where the liquid
was   neutral, or exhibited but feeble acid or alkaline reaction with
test-paper, the current obtained was very feeble, and was affected
 by very slight circumstances, so that the results in such cases
are necessarily less certain and less to be relied upon than in
the more definite ones.        We may select from amongst those
examined the    following solutions as being of the less certain cha
 racter:-hydrochlorate of ammonia, sulphite, sulphate, chlorate,
 nitrate, and tartrate of potash (bitartrate of potash was also
feeble), diphosphate, hyposulphite, sulphate, and nitrate of soda,
 chloride of sodium (bitartrate of soda was also feeble), and sul
                                     -
 phate of zinc.
     82. Thus, speaking in general terms, liable, as we have seen,
 to some slight exceptions, we may say that hot platinum is nega
 tive to cold platinum in acid liquids, and positive to it in alkaline
 ones; the only exceptions to this statement amongst the instances
 given are aqua-regia and dilute hydrocyanic acid, in which the
 hot plate was positive; sulphate of soda, which exhibited neutral
 reaction, and yet in which the hot metal was negative, though
 very feebly; and bitartrate of soda, in which, although of acid
 reaction, the hot metal was feebly positive.       On account of the

   83. To test the degree of delicacy of the foregoing apparatus
and method for detecting those supposed new properties of acid
and alkaline liquids, I made the following experiments:—Took
4 ounces of distilled water and # of a drachm of a mixture of 1
measure of pure and strong mitric acid and 16 measures of di
stilled water, and mixed them together = a mixture of 1 measure
of strong nitric acid and 2.192 measures of water; pre-boiled the

still negative, but             in      an
                            extremely feeble degree.    The liquid
gave very faint acid reaction with test-paper.       now increased               I
the proportion       acid  ofadding          by

currents,   I may now sum up the chief points ascertained.      The
currents under consideration are not due to thermo-electric pro
perties of the liquids, nor are they influenced in any material
degree by the simple thermo-electric properties of the metals.
They arise from a differential action of heat at the surface of
liquid contact of the two plates, and not from any action in the
body of the liquid, the latter functioning merely as a conductor
of the current. Hot platinum is almost invariably positive to
cold platinum in alkaline liquids, and as often negative in acid
liquids; and as far as             I
                             have examined other metals, they are
the same, provided chemical action is completely or sufficiently
excluded.    The currents obtained with platinum plates are not
due   (except   with a very few liquids, such as aqua-regia) to che
mical   action, but to some cause which I have not yet completely
determined; whilst with base metals, both this cause and che
mical affinity are in most cases operating; the one tending to
produce a current in one direction, and the other in an oppo
site one.
   86. As the currents obtained with platinum are extremely
minute, it is necessary to use a very sensitive galvanometer; and
it would be an advantage to have an examiner with larger plates
than the one described, say of 4 inches diameter.

and the equation           30°–4KO'=0                    becomes
                                  #(a+b+c)*— #(a+b+c)*=0,
which is satisfied identically. This is as it should be; for it is
plain that there exists a triangle, viz. the triangle (a =0, y=0,
z=0), inscribed in the conic U-0, and circumscribed about the
conic W = 0.
   Suppose that the equation of the conic containing the D is
                                            y”—42a:=0,
and the equation of the conic touched by the sides is
                       aa”--by”-H cz”=0.
Then the tangential equation of the last-mentioned conic is
                                   bcc”--cam”--ab<U+017F>º-0.
And if we take for the angles of the triangle a                           y : z=1:2X : A*,

                             then the equation                            ofthe line joining
the angles (u),         (v)   is
                                 2plva'-(u         +    v)!y-H2=0,
which will touch the conic aw”--by”--cz”=0                             if

And       it

                                 to                                                          is   of
course included   the general formula; and putting
                       in

we must have
                                            30°–4KG)/-0.
The discriminant           in     question        is
                           k”abc-i-k”ac—k.4b —4=0,
or   K=1,      G   =   #   ac,    G'=       —;     b,   K'- —4;     the required condition

                     In-and-circumscribed Triangle.             21
  is therefore ac-i-16b”=0, or
                             b= — #i Vac.
  Substituting this value, the equations
                                          become
                      cu” +i   Vca(u-Hv)*+a=0

                     cºu?--i Vca(A+ u)*+a=0.
 The first and second of these are
                          A +2H y + B vº–0
                          Al-H2H'v-H B'v”-0,

         AB–H3               = i Vac(a—i   vacu” +cu")
         A'B'— H12           = i Vac(a—i VacA*4-cx").
 And the result of the elimination therefore is
   (a—i VacNº-FCA*)(a—i Vacu” +cu")–(a—i Vacau +cººp”)*,
viz.
           2 Wea(A-u)*(cA*L*--i Vca(A +p)*4-a)=0;
which agrees, as   it should do, with the third equation.
    To find the condition that it may be possible in the conic
                            a”--y” + 2*=0
to inscribe an infinity of triangles, each of them
                                                    circumscribed
about the conic
                          aa”--by”--cz”=0.
Let the equations of the    sides be

                  !" war--m" Mby +n" woz=0.
Then the conditions of circumscription are

where it should be observed that bea”--cay”--abz”=0 is the
equation of the conic which is the polar of aw”--by”--cz”=0

represented by perfectly general equations.

general theorem.
   It is convenient to add (as a somewhat more general form of
the equation A+B+C = 0), that the condition in order that it

     In order that the axis oA may remain apparently at rest in
the  plane  P, it must in reality turn round ol with a velocity
equal to that of the earth, and in twenty-four hours describe a
cone of revolution.     Let 0A' be a position upon this cone infi
nitely close to oA. The couple which animates the gyroscope
turning, during the first instant, around 0A, has       axis directed                              its

forces perpendicular           the plane, and, to                       couple         ºntºy,                  a

of these tertiaries in the so-called London and Hamsphire basins
as areas of depositº.  It is not necessary to go over the grounds
for the proof of that which has long been admitted. It is well
known that Sir Charles Lyell long maintained a theory of the
rise and denudation of the Weald, on the like notion of the gra
dual removal of the materials into the basins or synclinals on
either side. This is now withdrawn and another substitutedt,
which the author allows to be provisional and tentative, in part
at least.
                                                          I
    In the early essay to which refer, showed that the Weald            I
Valley had no existence during the deposit of the tertiaries, and
that consequently the area of these deposits was much greater than
the synclinals in which they are now found. What was the full
extent of that area it is not now necessary to inquire.            There are
good grounds for believing that it extended over                that     now                all    is
the south-east    part      England,     of
                                        and also over     large  part     the         a                of

this mistake, but others have*.                                       -
   The conclusions this gentleman drew from his mechanical

                          had already arrived at from surface phaeno
mena,     the arrangements of longitudinal and transverse valleys,
the watershed and drainage.
   On both of his expositions of the theory of the Weald denu
dation, Sir C. Lyell has given me credit for pointing out the
opposing river gorges in the chalk as indicative of the direct ex
tension of the lines of fissure on which these gorges were formed
directly from side to side.                            I
                                         never laid much stress on this

of what have lately occurred in Japan. To those who may doubt
of the power of aqueous currents forcibly and suddenly to remove
the solid materials we know to have been lost from the Weald,
I  submit these considerations. It may be difficult to conceive a
motive power in running water equal to the removal of great
rock-masses without the help of ice, like the boulder, for instance,
mentioned by Mr. Godwin Austen, lying on the coast at Pagham
near Selsey, computed to weigh thirty tons. No earthquake
wave would float, and none perhaps propel such a mass.              But if
the bed on which the boulder lay was moved, that would move
also. Smeaton the engineer, in his autobiography, tells us that
he was employed to build a bridge on one of our northern rivers
(I quote from memory),                      I
                                 think it was either the Wear or the
Tyne,—where no bridge had hitherto been able to withstand the
floods.    Smeaton built his bridge, as he supposed, of sufficient
strength to withstand any flood to which it could be subjected.
It happened soon after that a contingency of rapid thaw and rain
produced a flood equal, if not superior, to          former precedent.      all

this eminent man found consolation            the assurance       inproof,                 by

down, but that the bed         the river was actually scooped out and

40                 Dr. Debus   on the Action          of Nitric Acid
on the water-bath to the consistency of a thick syrup.               This
residue consisted of glycolic, glyoxylic, and oxalic acids, and of
a member of the same class of compounds to which the aldehyde
of acetic acid belongs.      It was dissolved in water and neutralized
with carbonate of lime. On addition of alcohol, the glycolate
and glyoxylate of lime precipitated almost entirely, whilst the
aldehyde remained in solution.         The filtrate from this precipitate
was    evaported    on the  water-bath;    the aldehyde remained as a
thick syrup of a slight brown colour. It was soluble in tether,
except a small quantity of brown resinous matter.           The aetherial
solution left, after filtration and distillation at 100° C., a solid,
transparent, and amorphous substance of a slight yellow colour.
This residue consisted almost entirely of the aldehyde of gly
oxylic acid;       I
                   propose to call it Glyowal, C*H*O**.         It is iso
 meric with   glycolic  acid, and bears the same relation to glyoxylic
 acid as the   aldehyde   C*H*O to acetic acid.
    The strong aqueous solution of this substance was mixed with
 five or six times     its
                        bulk        of
                                    concentrated solution
                                      a                        bisulphite  of
of   soda.   After about three hours’     standing,     large quantity
                                                                     a                    of
 crystals formed around the sides             of
                                          the bottle      which the mix
                                                                     in
 ture was kept.
     These crystals were dissolved           little boiling water
                                              in   as                 pos            as
 sible, and the clear   liquid  allowed     cool gradually.
                                                 to             Prismatic

               a compound        of
     Glyoxal with bisulphite        of   soda,   2(Na HO. SO2), C*H*O3,
were obtained.     From the mother-liquor,       addition       on
                                                             alcohol,           of
another quantity        the same substance precipitated, which,
                         of
if not  quite  pure, was recrystallized    the same manner. This
                                                      in
compound forms white and hard crystals, easily soluble                                    in
water, but almost insoluble        alcohol. The aqueous solution
                                         in
turns  slightly yellow         on

   Sulphuretted hydrogen acts upon the glyoxal, and it is very
probable that merely an interchange of sulphur and oxygen be
tween both substances takes place.
   Sulphuretted hydrogen does not act on the isomeric glycolic
acid. Glycolate of lead was decomposed by sulphuretted hy
drogen, and after filtration the excess of the latter expelled by
heat.   The remaining acid, on being neutralized with carbonate
of  lime,  gave only crystals of glycolate of lime, which did not
contain a trace of sulphur.

46                Dr. Debus        on the Action         of Nitric Acid
   Whilst the glyoxal is oxidized easily by very diluted nitric acid,
it requires  an excess of strong acid to convert the glycolic into
oxalic acid.
   Frequently when I employed less nitric acid in the oxidation
of alcohol, as mentioned in my first paper on this subject, I
obtained along with glyoxal a liquid which possessed many pro
perties in common with glycerine, C*H*O°. As it is most likely
to contain, like glyoxal, glycolic and glyoxylic acids, two atoms
              I
of carbon, suppose it to be homologous with glycerine. Its
composition would be represented by the formula C*H* O°.           If
the latter is compared with that of glyoxal, it becomes at once
apparent that both stand in the same relation to each other as
alcohol and common aldehyde, and that aethyle-glycerine, gly
oxal, and glyoxylic acid, stand to each other as alcohol, aldehyde,
and acetic acid.
  Alcohol .         .        = C*H6 O               AEthyle-glycerine            =C*H* O*

  Acetic acid       .        = C*H* O”                 Glyoxylic acid        .   =C*H*O"
Therefore the oxidation of the alcohol by nitric acid appears not
to extend at once to the production of glyoxal and glyoxylic acid,
but the alcohol simply absorbs oxygen, and is converted into
another alcohol homologous with glycerine. The aethyle-glyce
rine would unite with more than one atom of a monobasic acid,
and accordingly we find                its
                               aldehyde—the glyoxal—combining
with two atoms      bisulphite
                        of         ammonia, and
                                             of     acid—the gly       its

    Glycerine, C*H* O”, should be produced from propylic
alcohol as athyle-glycerine is formed from common alcohol;
and the glycerine should yield with nitric acid an aldehyde,
C*H*O°, and an acid, C*H* O’, homologous with glyoxal and
glyoxylic acid.     The results of my experiments on this point
and on the other substances formed by the action of nitric acid
on common alcohol, C*H*O, will be communicated in a future

   Tartaric, citric, and malic acids, which occur frequently in
nature, accompany each other so often, that from this fact alone
one would suppose some similarity in their constitution.          I have
shown on another occasion, that if glyoxylic and tartaric acids
are regarded as bibasic, their radicals are polymeric.         Thus—

  The conversion             of maleic acid into carbonic acid and lactid has
not yet been realized, nevertheless it follows from the experi
ments of Engelhardt that lactid is intimately connected with
these acids.   On distilling lactic acid, he obtained citraconic acid;
but the latter is homologous with maleic acid, from which, accord
ing to the above equation, the lactid ought to be formed.

   The only analysis which comes near this is that by Friesmuth
from Hauenstein.      Rose (in his Krystallo-chemische     Mineral
system, p. 39) gives the mineral from that locality this formula,
and calls it mesolite.    Dana, again, makes it mesole, with an
equibasic formula, with which it seems indeed best to agree (see
note to Faröelite).    Hausmann, however (Handbuch, p. 801),
remarks, “der sogenannte Mesolith von Hauenstein              nach                                         ist

   The sole chemical difference, therefore, between mesolite and
faröelite is one equivalent of silica”; but the mineralogical
distinctions, between typical specimens, at least, are numerous
and well marked. Faröelite invariably occurs either in implanted
and isolated globules (I observed a single instance in the island
of Naalsóe, where these globules were prolonged into stalactites
of about 3 inches in length), or as a mammillated coating of
the rock.      These spheres, generally of a bluish colour, are,
though radiated in their structure, solid at the circumference as
at the centre, and have a decided pearly lustre on one, apparently
a cleavage face. Mesolite, again, is generally seen in delicate, free,
dead white fibres, which have no pearly lustre: in the finely
crystallized Iceland specimens, as also in those from Uig, the
lustre is vitreous.     One cavity in the rock will contain mesolite;
another close    by, Faröelite: when both occur in the same cavity,
the latter is   invariably  nearest the rock.      At Storr, as also                                      all
over Faröe, Faröelite occurs        solid spheres    in    blue tint, with    of
       plumes      of                     implanted       them,   perfectly     on a

                              have been      made
                  of larger dimensions in order to obtain elec
tric currents which should, as it were, stand midway between
those obtained   from the electric machine and those obtained
from the voltaic battery, several physicists and artists have
been occupied with the study of the phaenomena connected with
the subject.   Probably what has already been accomplished is
far from the perfection which it is possible to confer upon
these instruments; and there is no strong reason against the
supposition, that, with comparatively small means, sparks several
inches in length may be obtained at the extremities of the wire
of the induction coil, if the necessary insulation can be effected
without removing the wire too far from the central core. The
surrounding layer must be completely impenetrable to sparks                      |
which might spring from one series of coils to another.
   In the year 1854            I
                          constructed an induction apparatus in
which  I  endeavoured, as M. Sinsteden has done, to turn to ac
count the advantage possessed by magnets of the horseshoe form
over bar magnets.     The result was not that which hoped for;   I
for after the removal of the iron crosspiece which united both
limbs of the magnet, each bar singly showed a strong induction
current. It may be that the magnetic inertia of the massive
piece of iron is the cause of this, although subsequent experi
ments on the advantages of bundles of iron wire over the
massive iron core showed that too much weight must not be
attached to the action of the iron by               its
                                           temporary magnetism.
The same was observed              by
                            Prof. Poggendorff. According     him,      to

a good many     of the little bars may be removed from the spiral
without   weakening     the induced current; this was particularly
the case when the condenser was introduced.
    But although the horseshoe form of the electro-magnet above
mentioned did not produce the desired effect, one advantage of
this arrangement remains valuable, that             the use       the         is,                 of             in

each other up to contact, and they can be diverted so that a point
shall stand opposite a disc, or both discs opposite to each other.
 In addition to the conducting wires which proceed from the
induction coils, several wires for the passage of the current for
 other purposes may be attached to the discharger.
    5. The condenser is known to be a very important part of
the apparatus. Prof. Poggendorff and M. Sinsteden have already
 proved that it may be constructed in different ways.                  It is
important to arrange it so that it may be used to increase or
 diminish the extent of charged surface.            One attempt to con
 struct the condenser in this manner                                I
                                                   pass over, because no
 good result was obtained, at least it did not produce the effect
 of an ordinary wax-cloth condenser of the same surface. Never
theless        I
            have not found the fear expressed by M. Sinsteden,
that the wax-cloth condenser would be easily broken through
by the sparks when the excitement is intense, fulfilled.             In the
 drawer M is an ordinary wax-cloth condenser 8 Par. feet long,
built into layers separated from each other by varnished par
titions, and connected with the binding screws which stand at
the front of the drawer.        The attempts to construct a condenser
out of single pairs of plates                    I
                                     have not yet given up, as it pos
sesses great advantages. The condenser of M. Sinsteden, formed
                                                           of its

that      on
          account             of
                        the thickness         the glass,       must have             it         a
greater surface than the wax-cloth condenser; and besides this,
such     condenser
          a              very fragile,
                                  is                       as
                                             the thinnest glass must                            be

     6.Experiments with the apparatus gave                  development          a              of
induced currents       which,        my   knowledge,
                                                to        has never been
attained hitherto.      The change         the sparks passing between
                                                          of

                                                 is          when those

tained from 12 to 14 lines in length, which do not follow the
direct line joining the points, but sometimes describe consider
able zigzag curves.   Such long and rarely occurring sparks are,
however, only obtained when the lever C is pulled as strongly
as possible, so that the pressure of the platinum point on the
copper spring is very strong. When the points of the discharger
are caused to approach within about 8 lines of each other,
a continuous stream of sparks passes, which becomes more
intense when the play of the interruptor is permitted to proceed
more quickly.      The play of sparks at the discharger is very
beautiful when a bit of chalk, sugar, glass or wood is placed
between the points.     Wood-shavings, paper, cotton-wool, and
gunpowder, are immediately ignited by the sparks.
   As these induced sparks develope a comparatively greater
amount of heat than those of the electric machine, even when
they proceed from the strongest battery, it may be expected that
such instruments will find application in the art of war, more
especially as preliminary experiments in France, with far feebler
apparatus,       have already          given       satisfactory        results.          The igni
tion of gunpowder, for example, is immediately effected when
Warrentrap's fuse is made use                    of.

chief until their surfaces gave a uniform flush when breathed
on.     Between these plates was then placed a piece of hand-bill
printed on one side only; pieces of tinfoil rather smaller than
the glasses were placed on the outside of each, and these coatings
were connected with the secondary terminals of a Ruhmkorff
coil. After a few minutes' electrization, the coatings were care
fully removed, and the interior surface of the glass when breathed
on, showed with great beauty the printed words which had been
opposite        it,

becomes more manifest when we inquire as to the analogy or
dissimilarity to existing forms, its mode of occurrence—the rela
tive abundance or scarcity—the broken or preserved condition—the
organisms with which it is associated—the nature of the rock, mud,
sand, gravel, or calcareous matter, and other circumstances which
would lead to the inference respecting the probable depth of the sea,
 and whether the creature had lived on the spot or been drifted from
 a distance.    So with a mineral, its chemical constitution is one
 thing, but its mode of occurrence another—the species with which
it is associated—the composition of the rock in which it is imbedded,
 whether intimately mixed, occasionally aggregated or in distinct
 crystals—whether occurring in veins or fissures—the chemical rela
 tions of the substance to the containing rock, whether segregated
 during consolidation of the rock or subsequently elaborated, are
 some of the points of inquiry in the “paragenesis’ of a mineral species.
    Independently of mineralogy, geology has also received important
aid from chemistry, in determining the composition of rocks and
the changes they have undergone, in suggesting the various pro
 cesses of fossilization, in explaining the results of volcanic and
pseudo-volcanic phaenomena,        &c.   It is well known that Prof.
Bischof has devoted a considerable portion of his time to the
bearings of chemistry on mineralogy and geology, and his original
work evidences a vast amount of labour and research in collecting
together so much useful matter. The English edition is translated
from a revised copy by the author of the original work; the facts
are more condensed, the subjects are arranged in a more systematic
order than in the German edition, and treated in such a manner, as
to render it not only a useful work of reference, but a standard
treatise for some time upon many of the important and interesting
questions in chemical and physical geology.        The present edition
is  by no means a mere translation or      abridgement  of the German,
but an   independent   work, in which the additional chemico-geological
facts ascertained since the publication of the latter, have been incor
porated and concisely illustrated.
    Our space will scarcely permit any details of the numerous
valuable facts contained in the work, but the following are some of
the principal subjects treated in the first and second volumes. The
laws of combination in the mineral kingdom as regards the decom
position, conversion and formation of minerals and rocks; and
pseudomorphism, which affords such important aid, and is in a great
measure the storehouse out of which the knowledge of these laws
are chiefly to be drawn, is fully considered, as described from the
labours of Rose, Haidinger, Blum, Breithaupt, and the author.
    The waters on the earth, by which the greatest part of its surface
has been formed or modified, the deposition of chemical and mecha
nical sediments and those from organic agency, the share which the
mineral kingdom takes in the change of the constituents of atmospheric
air, are successively treated; the later chapters of the first volume are
devoted to the consideration of the simple salts, according to their
distribution and importance.      The second volume is more useful to

the mineralogist, as it contains the chemical reactions relating to the
alteration of minerals, and describes in detail the characters, occur
rence, formation, and decomposition of many of the more important
minerals which either enter into the composition of rocks or are
essentially connected with them, as the silicates, quartz and other
siliceous minerals, zeolites, felspar, tourmaline, garnet, augite and
analogous compounds, mica, chlorite, serpentine, steatite, talc, and
magnetic iron-ore.         Under the last subject the magnetic influence of
rocks is treated, but no allusion is made to the important paper
by M. Delesse, published in the Annales des Mines for 1848.
    Wernerian tendencies are strongly exhibited throughout the work,
for Prof. Bischof considers that the origin of many minerals may be
explained by the aqueous agency, although he does not doubt that
their formation may have also taken place by fusion.                    How far
geologists will be inclined to agree with him, that, “with the ex
ception of lava, scoriae, and other volcanic products, there is no rock
whose igneous origin can be proved with equal certainty,” is a ques
tion. That the igneous theory per se has been too hastily or gener
ally adopted for the explanation of some of the phaenomena attributed
to   it,may require further investigation.           The combination         both                        of
agencies, assisted by thermo-electric action, acting upon masses                                                   of
rock, may have induced                    an

and   brought    into   play  new chemical     affinities,  thereby eliminating
fresh mineral      compounds,      and which have       again   been altered by
the influence         of
                       other   processes,    perhaps    more   gradual       their                       in
operation.

                           Prof. Bischof, “chemical analyses             minerals                   of

 An    Introduction to the Use of the Mouth-Blowpipe.        By Dr. T.
    SchEERER.      Translated, with additions, by H. T.      BLANFoRD.
    Leipsic and London, 1856.
    It is unnecessary here to remark on the advantages of the blow
 pipe in the investigation of mineral substances.     From the time of
 Swab to that of Gahn, it was an instrument more or less applied
 in chemical research; to Berzelius, however, we are indebted for
 extending and improving its application, and his work, ‘The Use of
 the Blowpipe,’ 1821, was translated into most of the European lan
 guages, and was long considered a standard work on the subject.
 C. F. Plattner, continuing the researches of Harkhort, and having
 devoted some years to the use of this instrument, published about
 twenty years since, Die Probirkunst mit dem Löthrohre, of which, two
much-extended editions have subsequently appeared, and have been
 translated into English by Dr. Muspratt.
    The Löthrohrbuch of Scheerer is intended as an introduction to the
 use of the blowpipe; the first part of that work, containing the
 use of the mouth-blowpipe, being only translated by Mr. Blanford.
 This part includes a short description of the apparatus for researches
with the blowpipe, and instructions for the qualitative examination
 of substances so as to ascertain the presence or absence of certain
bodies; and to which is appended two Tables, the first containing
 the various metallic oxides arranged according to the colours they
impart to borax and microcosmic salt respectively;       the second on
 the behaviour of metallic oxides and certain metallic acids, with the
 same reagents, this table being extracted from Plattner's larger work.
 To this has been added by the compiler a second part, and which
 occupies more than half of the remainder of the book, containing the
 characters presented before the blowpipe of many of the most im
 portant and frequently occurring       mineral species, these being
arranged according to the basic system; their chemical formulae are
also given from Rammelsberg.         The various minerals are usefully
 tabulated under the different bases, the blowpipe characters being
 arranged in eight columns, according to the phaenomena presented
 either alone, or by the action of different reagents.     This part is
 principally compiled from the work of Plattner, with additions from
 those of von Kobell and Rammelsberg.         With these additions the
 work forms a useful and concise hand-book for the student, and is
 also valuable to those who cannot readily consult the larger and
more important volume of Plattner.
.   Some slight typographical errors occur, as Epromite for Epsomite,
 MO3 for TO3; and at p. 129, under Silica, “Nickel is present in the
 green anhydrous variety Chlorophane,” instead, we presume, of Chry
 soprase.   The reactions with nitrate of cobalt might have been more
 usefully extended, according to colour, than that given at p. 91.
The compiler has verified many of the statements, and has supplied
 details (where in some cases deficient) from personal experiment;
 circumstances prevented him from examining the metallic minerals;
 but we do not see why on that account Mr. Blanford should regret
being “obliged to rely principally on the authority of Professor Platt-
ner,” the first of assayists, instead of his own observations.

coalescence     a concave line.       The two photographic images will have
all their vertical lines bent in the same manner, and the stereoscope
will give the illusion of a picture represented on a concave surface.
    When we look at natural objects, the optical axes have to con
verge more for the nearest than for the furthest, in order to obtain
a single vision by bringing the same object on the centre of each
retina; therefore by habit we judge of the distances by the angle
formed by the optical axes required to obtain a single vision. Again,
while we look at one object, while other objects in the same line are
situated before and behind that object, we have the sensation of
their double images on the two retinae. The double images of nearer
                                                                                                     º
objects are situated in the following order: one on the right of the
centre of the right retina, and the other on the left of the centre of                               s
the left retina; and the double images of further objects, one on the
left of the right retina, and the other on the right of the left retina.
     In looking at the two pictures in the stereoscope, we have to con
verge the optical axes on one point which is beyond the plane of the
 pictures, so that two of their correspondent or similar points appear
 respectively on the two lines forming the angle of convergence of the
 optical axes, and each of these points is represented on the centre
 of one retina. As the two corresponding points of the two pictures
 are laterally nearer each other for the first plane and more distant
 for the receding plane, it follows that the optical axes have to con
 verge beyond the plane of the pictures on a nearer point for the first,
 and on a further point for the last. Therefore, the angle of con
 vergence by which similar points of the two pictures appear on each
 axis and consequently fall on the centre of each retina, conveys the
 sensation of their respective distances; more convergence indicates
 less distance, and less convergence more distance.                    All the other
 corresponding points of the two pictures which are not on the op
 tical axes or on similar points of the two retinae, form double images;
 and when we look at one point,               all

       A very simple experiment may show the cause                     the illusion         of                         of
    concavity        of
                     flat surfaces when examined through semi-lenses, and
    further prove that semi-lenses may give alternately the illusion                                                   of

 74            -                                Royal Society:—
 concavity and convexity according to the position of their thin edges;
 of concavity when their edges are towards each other, and of con
vexity when they are placed contrariwise.         For this experiment we
have only to employ a pair of those spectacles mounted with a spring
whereby they are held on the nose.
   When we read, holding such spectacles with both hands, we may
by the elasticity of the spring adjust the two lenses so that the pupils
of the eyes can coincide, first, with the two nearest edges, secondly, with
the two centres, and thirdly, with the two furthest edges of the lenses.
   In the first case, the page of the book will appear concave, because
the pupils will look through the thin edges of the lenses which bend
the vertical lines with their concave sides turned towards each other;
in the second, the page will appear flat, because the pupils will look
through the centres of the lenses which show the vertical lines per
fectly straight; and in the third case, the page of the book will ap
pear convex, because the pupils will look through the thin edges of
the lenses which bend the vertical lines with their convex sides turned
towards each other.
   These considerations have led the author to construct a stereo
scope which presents flat surfaces perfectly flat. This new stereo
scope     has two entire lenses instead of two semi-lenses, and the eyes
 look   through     the centre of such lenses.         The images not being late
 rally refracted, as in the semi-lenticular stereoscope, their coalescence
 requires a certain effort of divergence, or to squinting outwards,
 which a little practice will enable us to perform easily.                    Persons
 capable of using this kind of stereoscope will see a picture whose
 surface is perfectly flat with           the illusionall                    of
                                                            relief and distance.

     This fact naturally         the possibility of correcting the defect
                            suggests
of the refracting stereoscope; for if the images of the      camera were
taken by semi-lenses, the bend resulting from this mode of operating
might be corrected by the bend of the stereoscope, care being taken
to turn the thi<U+017F> edge of the semi-lenses of the two cameras in the
direction which will produce a bending contrary to that of the semi
lenses of the stereoscope.
   Having shown how the lateral proportional distances of any two
correspondent points of the two stereoscopic pictures are the indices
of their perspective distances, if we were, while looking in the stereo
scope, to produce a change in those proportional lateral distances by
sliding horizontally in a contrary direction, two pairs of superposed
glass photographic pictures, the objects would appear to move, not in
the horizontal lateral direction of that change which they naturally
have, but in a straight line forward and backward, as if the object
was approaching or receding.                                      -
    But the most curious effect of that motion would be, that the objects
would appear increasing in size while they were receding, and diminish
ing while approaching, which we know is contrary to the rule of
perspective. This is another illusion entirely physiological, and the
cause of which may be thus explained; while the object appears
moving forward and backward it remains always the same size, but
as we expect when it moves forward that it should increase in size,
and when it moves backward that it should decrease, and as it does
not, we feel that it is diminishing when approaching and increasing
 when receding.
     “A Memoir    upon Caustics.”      By Arthur Cayley, Esq., F.R.S.
   The principal object of this memoir, which contains little or nothing
that can be considered new in principle, is to collect together the
  rincipal results relating to caustics in plano, the reflecting or refract
ing curve being a right line or a circle, and to discuss with more
care than appears to have been hitherto bestowed upon the subject,
some of the more remarkable cases.       The memoir contains in parti
cular researches relating to the caustic by refraction of a circle for
parallel rays, the caustic by reflexion of a circle for rays proceeding
from a point, and the caustic by refraction of a circle for rays pro
ceeding from a point; the result in the last case is not worked out,
but it is shown how the equation in rectangular coordinates is to be
obtained by equating to zero the discriminant of a rational and inte
gral function of the sixth degree.     The memoir treats also of the
secondary caustic or orthogonal trajectory of the reflected or refracted
rays in the general case of a reflecting or refracting circle and rays
proceeding from a point; the curve in question, or rather a secondary
caustic,   is,    well known, the Oval
                 as   is                             of

which, when the incident rays are parallel, must be taken for the
 secondary caustic in the place of the Cartesian, which, for the parti
 cular case in question, passes off to infinity.      In the course of the
memoir, the author reproduces a theorem first given, he believes,
by himself in the Philosophical Magazine, viz. that there are six
 different systems of a radiant point and refracting circle which give
rise to identically the same caustic. The memoir is divided into
 sections, each of which is to a considerable extent intelligible by
itself, and the subject of each section is for the most part explained

     November 19,   1856.-Col. Portlock, President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Occurrence of crystallization        in Stucco.” By Dr.
 Buist. Communicated by Sir R. I. Murchison, F.G.S.
    The author remarked that in the spring of 1848 a quantity of
fragments of plaster-castings which he had thrown out of doors
were, after exposure to the atmosphere and rain, before long covered
with crystals of selenite. Specimens, communicated by Dr. Buist,
were exhibited, together with calcareous casts of shells and tubular
bodies, from the upraised beaches of the coast of India, which the
author sent and described as exhibiting other interesting instances
of alteration in molecular arrangement.
    2.  “On the Occurrence of Allophane at Charlton, Kent.” By
J.   Morris, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author described the circumstances under which allophane
occurs in the fissures of the Chalk near Woolwich, and pointed out
that its formation was evidently of later date than the disturbances
of the Chalk and the overlying Thanet sands, and of the determina
tion of the present physical features of the district.
    An analysis made by Mr. Dick gave the following composition:—
    Silica 1889, alumina 33’52, water 42-73, lime l'67, carbonic acid
2:51, organic matter, a trace.
    Mr. Morris suggested that this allophane was probably due to
the percolation of atmospheric waters through the superficial de
posits, and the sands immediately overlying the chalk; and he
pointed out that probably Scarbroite (or Kollyrite), Pholerite, and
several other allied hydrosilicates of alumina should not be regarded
as distinct mineral speciés; the slight variation in their chemical
formulae having been probably determined by the local conditions
under which each of them originated.
    3. “On the Red Sandstones and Quartzites of the North-west of
Scotland.” By Prof. James Nicol, F.G.S.
    The district described in this communication stretches, N.N.E.
and S.S.W., from Cape Wrath and Durness to Sleat, the southern
portion of the Isle of Skye, with an extent of more than 100 miles
and a breadth of from 15 to 30 miles.       Its structure was illustrated
by transverse sections afforded by Loch Broom, across the centre of

Prof. Nicol on Red Sandstones                      of the North-west of Scotland. 77
the  district, by Loch Assynt, the Kyles of Durness, and Loch
Eriboll, on the north, and on the south by Lochs Greinord, Gairloch,
Maree, Keeshorn, and Carron, and by a section of the southern part
of Skye. These sections present more or less uniformly the follow
ing ascending series of rocks, which, excepting the lower gneiss,
have in general an inclination towards the S.E.:—1. Gneiss, with
some granitic veins, and having a general N.W. and S.E. direction.
2. Red conglomerates, grits, and sandstone, lying unconformably
on the gneiss, and exposed along a tract of about 20 miles in width:
these beds are at least 3000 feet thick, but rapidly thin off eastward.
3. White quartzite, unconformable to the red sandstone, and fre
quently accompanied by an overlying, hard, dark-coloured, siliceous
limestone; these form a band about 10 miles wide, and are in places
at least 500       ft.
                  thick.         Gneiss, occasionally

                                                                            a
from the lower gneiss, and distinctly seen                 many localities
                                                                     at          over             to
lie the quartzite. Gneiss also constitutes the country                              to
                                                                        the eastward.
    These rocks, with occasional serpentimes, porphyries, and other
igneous rocks, were described               detail; and
                                                  in           was stated that the
                                                                          it

                                                                     of

fossils, first observed            by
                               Mr. Peach.
    The author pointed out that the red sandstones and conglomerates
 (No. 2), occurring along the district described, decidedly form parts
of   one series, and that,            his opinion, they are referable
                                         in                                         the            to
Devonian age, whilst the         overlying     and unconformable quartzite and
limestone (No. 3), judging from their position and mineral character,
represent the Lower Carboniferous series                          of
                                                          the South         Scotland;     of
 although     in
               this      he
                        necessarily     differs from Sir            Murchison's opi
                                                                           of R.

       To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
                 you will allow me a corner in your next Number to
 PERHA's say that I have recently succeeded in constructing what I
 believe to be a new form of the stereoscope.          Its object is to unite
 large binocular photographic pictures in a different way from any
 that has hitherto been followed.
    The pictures are placed side by side, and viewed through two
 small telescopes, like those of opera-glasses, with the directions of
their axes crossing each other; the left-hand picture being viewed
with the right eye, and the right-hand picture with the left eye. The
two telescopes are connected together, the connecting apparatus
being capable of two adjustments; one to suit the width of the eyes,
and the other to give the obliquity required.         When the instrument
is placed on a stand, as I have
                                                        to it,
                                       two other adjustments are required;
the first   bring the telescopes
               to                      the proper elevation, and the second
to  bring the plane       their axes into parallelism with the upper
                                    of                                                                                 or

    The instrument        constructed
                                    is       such    way that these adjust
                                                                  in               a

the effect    excellent.

    Ifyou have any reason        suppose that the instrument
                                                  to                not new,                            is

XIII.  On the Electric Conducting Power of the Metals of the
  Alkalies and Alkaline Earths.  By A. MATTHIESSEN, Ph.D.”
                                [With       a   Plate.]
    HE electric conducting             power      of one of these metals, potas
       sium, was determined by Becquerel about thirty years agot ;
he found its ratio to that of silver to be l'7: 100, whereas ac
cording to my experiments this ratio appears to be 22-6: 100.
He, however, is not sufficiently explicit in the description of the
method he employed for one to ascertain the cause of this great
difference in our results.  Latterly, after my experiments on the
alkaline metals were finished and the results already printed f,
M. Lamy S published a notice on the electric conducting power
of potassium and sodium, wherein he only states the place in the
series these two metals take compared with those whose conduct
ing powers are already decided; in this respect his results agree
with mine.
    For these experiments I employed wires formed by pressure.
The press consisted of a small block of steel, the section of which
 (Plate I. fig. 1) shows it of its natural size. In the hole, which
ends in a fine round opening, the metal is placed, and the steel
piston being fitted on, the press is fixed between two small iron
bars, which are then placed in a vice.       Potassium, sodium and
lithium, on account of their strong tendency to oxidation, were
pressed immediately in a trough filled with rock-oil, the                          oil

having been previously boiled in small portions at a time with
metallic sodium to make it perfectly dry and free from oxygen.
Fig. 2 shows the process of pressing the wires.     Here we have
the vice and the iron bars mentioned above, the latter connected
at the upper end in such a manner as to permit the pressure of
the vice to act on the steel press which is held between them at
the lower end within the trough of rock-oil; the bar which is in
contact with the block of the press has an aperture through
which the wire can pass. As soon as the wire appears it is laid
hold of with pincers and inserted in a wire-holder, consisting of
 two pieces of hard brass whose extremities are riveted at one end
 to a thick copper wire, and press together at the other, as shown
in fig. 3; the copper wire is bent and fixed in the block of wood
 i, fig. 2. The wire-holder was moved back and the wire increased
 until it had attained the desired length, when it was cut off from
 the press and fastened in the second wire-holder, the press and
 bars being removed.         In the trough a plate of glass was sup                   it,
ported in such a position that the wire lay upon                      order          in                  to
prevent the latter from distending through the effect                      own                of   its
weight: this precaution was especially necessary with potassium,

   The method                    which the electrical resistance was determined
was that given                   Mr. Wheatstone, modified         the use       by                  of   an

             the Metals              of the        Alkalies and Alkaline Earths.                                       83            -
apparatus constructed by Prof. Kirchhoff.      The principle of Mr.
Wheatstone’s method is as follows:—When four wires form the
four sides of a quadrilateral figure, with one of the diagonals of
which a battery is connected, and with the other a galvanometer,
if no current be indicated by the latter, the resistances of the four
sides are proportional.    Suppose, then, the first of these wires to
be of the metal whose resistance is sought; the second, a che
mically pure silver wire; and the third and fourth, parts of a
copper wire stretched on a strip of wood, and separated from
each other by a block of lead with a shield of copper on one side,
which moves along the wood, keeping the edge of the copper in
contact with the wire, and that a wire of the same metal connects
this shield with the galvanometer.     Then if no current passes
through the latter, we have the ratio of the electric resistances
of the wire under observation, and the normal silver wire iden
tical with that of the parts of the copper wire divided by the
 shield, which is easily read off by means of a scale affixed to the
wood,
    The arrangement of the apparatus is shown in fig. 5. The
strip of wood, A, about 4 inches wide and 1 inch thick, has two
binding screws, a and                    middle point; these hold the two

   In the case of potassium, sodium and lithium, it was to be
feared that a conducting power a little too small would be ob
tained, on account of their unavoidably oxidizing a little before
the observations could be made. The oxidation of the wires took
place gradually, and had some influence on their resistances, as
some experiments on this point showed; the resistance of a wire
immediately after being secured in the wire-holder was deter
mined, and again after 5, 10, 15', &c. had elapsed.  In the fol

     We may take it for granted that above the point of fusion
 these vacuums entirely disappear, and hence that from this point
 upwards the given expressions are correct. With potassium,
between the temperatures 46°8 and 56°8, there is certainly
some change in the nature of them; but as we know no law
according to which this takes place, we are not in a position to
estimate their influence for this interval of temperature.
   Matteucciº has found, that with bismuth the conducting
power increases at the point of fusion, and      am able to corro    I
borate his results by experiments   performed   in a similar way to
those just described: there is probably some connexion between
this and the contraction of this metal at the same point.
   For the sake of another example, Rose's metal was experi
mented with ; the curve obtained was similar to that for potas
sium. An interesting fact was observed with the pressed wires
which was not found with those cast in tubes; namely, if a
pressed wire of Rose's metal be gradually heated and then cooled
and the resistances at certain temperatures noted, these are found
the same either with increase or decrease of temperature if the
wire has not been heated above 40°C.;        however,        if,
                                                          has been                  it

XIV.     Chemical Examination of, and Remarks on, the Mineral
    Species Tyrite.       By D. FoEBEs, F.G.S., F.C.S., A.I.C.E.”
        Poggendorff’s Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 1856, No.4,
IN p. 622–628,          is inserted a communication from M. Kenngott
of   Vienna,    entitled “Notiz über das Tyrit genannte Mineral,”
in which the author makes some remarks on the crystalline form
of that mineral, and institutes a comparison between it and the
Greenland mineral Fergusonite, from which he concludes that
both these species are identical.
    Before making any observations on this question, am enabled I
to bring forward a chemical examination of the mineral from the
same locality as those examined crystallographically by M. Kenn
gott, and received from Dr. Bondi of Dresden.
  * The species is Norwegian, and obtained from the large fel
spar quarry at Helle at Naeskül, about ten English miles east of
Arendal+, where the mineral occurs pretty abundantly, and occa
sionally in crystals above 2 inches in length.
    These crystals invariably have their bases attached to plates of
black mica, and shoot out thence, imbedding themselves in the
red orthoclase, which very frequently forms thin plates or slabs
of from # of an inch to 4 inches in thickness, bounded on both
sides by the black mica.
    The annexed woodcut gives an idea
of this mode of occurrence.
    The minerals associated are orthite,
alvite, ametallic mineral containing ura
nium, uranium ochre, and a new mine- is
ralofabrown-red colournotyetanalysed.
                                                      I
    In none of the very numerous crystals have obtained are the
angles otherwise than extremely uneven and indistinct, having
often a rounded or compressed appearance, and are almost always
pyramidal, running off to a point without any distinct facets.
Not the slightest degree of reliance could be put upon measure
ments obtained by the hand-goniometer. They present a qua
drilateral section, and are probably tetragonal, having one distinct
cleavage plane, and traces of two others. The fracture, cleavage,
and colour are so different from those of the original Tyrite from
Hampemyr on Tromoe, that, until after the present analysis was
made, it was considered uncertain whether they were the same
mineral.
    * Communicated by the Author.
    f There  is a mistake in the locality as given by M. Kenngott; Helle being
on the mainland at Naeskül, and not on the Island of Tromoe. A section
of this quarry will be found in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological
 Society of London, May 1855.         Dr. Bondi's specimens were,   I  believe,
collected by Zschau of Dresden.                -

uncertain at present, it would be only guesswork to attempt
deducing a formula; but it will be at once seen from the above
analysis, that the mineral from Helle is identical with the Tyrite
from Hampemyr on the Island of Tromoe, described in the New
Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, No. 1, 1855.
   With regard to the mineral Fergusonite, from Kikertaurvak
near Cape Farewell in Greenland, our information at present rests
upon Haidinger's crystallographic examination (Edinb, Roy.
Soc, Trans. vol. x. p. 274), Berzelius's blowpipe reactions, and
Hartwall’s chemical analysis, both in the Kongl. Vetenskabs
Academiens Handlingar for 1828, p. 167, to which M. Kenngott
has not brought forward any addition; and not having seen
any specimen of that mineral,                      I
                                    must refer entirely to these
authorities.
   The comparison of the two minerals instituted by M. Kenngott
rests upon—
   1. Their crystallographic identity.  But the crystals of Tyrite
hitherto found are so  extremely uneven and irregular, as before
mentioned, that no dependence can be placed upon measurements
of their angles by a hand-goniometer; and quite as many dis
cordant results could be adduced to meet those cited by M. Kenn
gott. There seems, however, much probability that the crystal
line form will prove the same, but this is not so certain as to set
the matter at rest.
   2. Resemblance in physical properties.       These present several
points of unquestionable agreement; the colour, glance, and
streak must be pretty nearly the same.        The hardness of Tyrite
is  probably   but  very  little  higher,     specimens         all
                                                            have tried           I
scratching orthoclase, and being about 6:5; Fergusonite being
stated     as
           5.5    6-0. The specific gravity
                     to                            Tyrite     however,of                is,
decidedly lower than that        Fergusonite, which

 (Allan), and 5'800 (Turner); whereas the mean
                                                                                of of

from Helle and Hampemyr, was 5:33, and only one specimen
was found       to   be
                   above 5-36.      All the specimens were perfectly
pure, any decomposed         weathered parts being carefully removed
                                   or
if  present.                   -

minerals  containing  this metal.                      .
   According      Berzelius and Hartwall, Fergusonite only evolves

IT inmayexhausting
          be rash to announce as new any form of an instrument
                    the varieties of which every effort of ingenuity
has already been employed, and on which, it may be said at pre
sent, literally as well as metaphorically, the eyes of the nation
are fixed, so that we cannot tell what a day may produce, or
what it may already have produced.          therefore advance the      I
claim with           all
                due hesitation, and with the distinct proviso that
novelty     asserted only
              is               far     our own knowledge goes, and
                                        as            as

shown, and only        far       shall further limit the claim
                                so      as I                            the                         in
following description.
    To commence that limitation, then, there              novelty       theis   no                  in
mere fact      uniting large binocular pictures. Professor Wheat
                   of
stone's instrument does that but for such pictures
                                              ;                  liable               it   is            to
several objectionst.         the first place, according
                                      In                    his method,              to
the pictures must face each other; and when large, they must
              long way apart,
to be
    placed       a                               so
                                    that they cannot easily      attached                  be
    the instrument;    consequently    you   must either   put        sup                        up
ports for both,      hang them
                                                     an on

at  the risk    finding these
                    of                  unsuitable distance, unequally
                                             to at
illuminated, and subject           other inconveniences.       Secondly,
 there    some trouble
         is                  placing  in
                                      them   exactly parallel.   Thirdly,
if  the instrument       not placed precisely
                                 is               equidistant   from the
 two, the one will appear larger than the other, and they will
 refuse     unite.
            to       Fourthly, there          considerable loss
                                                             is   a   light                      of

          Mr.   J.    Elliot on two new Forms of                       the Stereoscope.                   105
possession two beautiful binocular photographic landscapes, by
Mr. Wilson of Aberdeen. They were not small pictures, such
as are usually made for the stereoscope, but were each some
where about 12 or 13 inches long and 10 broad.    Mr. Waterston
had been in the habit of uniting stereoscopic views by the eye
alone, without the use of an instrument.      He tried the large
landscapes in the same way and succeeded in uniting them, but
with that picture which is usually the right-hand one placed on
the left, and the left-hand one on the right.      Having tried to
unite the  pictures  in the same  way, but without success, I im
mediately undertook to produce an instrument by which the pur
pose might be effected, and found the attempt successful.        In
fact  Ihad  thought    of the same instrument before for    uniting
small binocular pictures crosswise.     That instrument is simple
enough.     It consists of a wooden frame, like a box open at one
end; the two sides (represented by A B and CD in fig. 1) fold
together with hinges at A and C, while the front or closed end,
A C, has two openings, E and           the distance

 the left eye, and the right-hand picture from the right eye, each
 eye sees only the picture                     on
                                    the other side; the axes           vision                     of
 evidently cross each other, and the various points                the land                  of
 scape appear where the visual rays from the same points                   the                          on
 two pictures intersect each other, and consequently between the
 pictures and the eyes.

 phaenomenon presents itself. When the pictures first unite, the
 eye     tolerably well satisfied with the result, but not thoroughly

decided upon constructing the instrument without the box alto
gether, as an unnecessary appendage when the telescopes were
used ; and it now appears very much like an opera-glass with
the two telescopes converging outwardly, so that the directions
of sight cross each other.
   The instrument, exhibited in fig. 2, is made capable of two
separate adjustments: one to accommo
date the positions of the telescopes to the
distance of the eyes from each other, the
other to give the degree of convergence
required. The first object is attained by
placing the two telescopes on the extre
mities of a support like the letter V,
                           two branches open
                                  on its

ing and closing                 hinge; and the
                                           a
latter   object            by
                       making     each telescope
turn on       vertical
              a           axis,  which must                                  be
directly below the eyepiece             order that       in
the one adjustment may not disturb the
other.    When the instrument                placed            is
        stand, two other adjustments are

 110           Mr. P.    J.  Martin on the Anticlinal Line of
    The “subcretaceous zone” will now engage the observer's atten
 tion, and he will meet with greater complexity of composition:
 on the upper beds of the lower greensand, angular flint, chert,
fragmentary sandstone, and the above-mentioned carr-stone in
 angular masses, thrown together in various proportions and with
 more or less rubble, and often lodged in hollows scooped out of
the soft sand-rock. There is yet no admixture of materials
foreign to the country, except now and then a few “eocene peb
bles,” and, more rarely still, some pebbles of hard chalk.
    I  have alluded to some exceptional cases to be found in a
review of the drift of the Weald.           The two most remarkable of
these with which I am         acquainted    are, the gravel beds at Hever,
on the banks of the Medway, as described by Sir Roderick Mur
chison (Journ. of Geol. Soc. loc. cit.), and a no less important
bed on the banks of the Arun at Slinfold, between Horsham and
 Rudgwick, in the central valley of the aris of the Weald. I had
the pleasure of showing the last-mentioned bed to Sir Charles
Lyell last summer.          It is composed of the rubble or detritus of
the   surrounding    Wealden,      much angular chert, angular flint, and
some eocene     shingle     with  particles of haematite from the ferru
ginous sands of the lower greensand.              I believe it more likely,
that in both these cases the materials of these beds of drift were
not brought from the several districts in which they are now
found in situ, but were derived from the kindred masses left
behind at the periods of great convulsion, and in the yawnings
of the great fissures at the time of upheaval.           The nearest points
from whence the flints and eocene pebbles of the Slinfold drift
could be derived by transport, are, on the north, twelve, and on
the south, seventeen miles; and neither of these in the most
probable line of drift, viz. from west to east, along the longitu
dinal valleys of the Weald.
    I have already said, in another place, that mammal bones have
been found in the drift of the Wealden districts; and as some
inferences have been drawn from the position and levels at which
these discoveries have been made, it may be well to recur to that
subject.     I have a fragment of an elephant’s tooth found by Mr.
W. Constable at Charlwood, near one of the sources of the Mole.
Elephants’ bones have been found at Coldwaltham, sixty feet
above the sea-level.        Other mammal bones at West Burton in
chalk-rubble something higher, and at Burpham still higher, as
mentioned by Mantell and Sir R. Murchison (Journ. of Geol.
does not abound, enables me to speak with great confidence of this minute
but significant feature.    In many places where the plough has been at work
for centuries, but more still in fresh broken hedgerows and coppice ground,
these fragments are turned up sometimes in an angular and uneven state,
sometimes a little water-worn.

Soc. loc. cit.); and other cases of the discovery of such remains
in the drifts of            all
                      levels are not wanting.     The impression on
my mind has generally been, when these bones have turned up,
that they have the appearance          being the relics   of   animals                            of
                irruption,                                     up

agency, but least           of
                          that    all

tuous clays.
   As   general rule, the remains

formation     these drifts, and which have been, like the mammal

much pleasure.          I
                       venture to predict that it will be characterized
by the careful research and correct analysis that distinguish the
writings of that gentleman. He will assign to the eocene shin
gle, to the angular flint, and to the “northern drift,” their proper
share in the general mass, and their proper sources.            He will
show from whence the materials foreign to the stratified beds of
the “London basin” were derived, and perhaps, venture some
speculations respecting the boulder clays.         He will intercalate
here and there some fragment of a stratified bed of the older or
newer pliocene.      But will he tell us to what agencies we owe
the  intermingling    of these discordant materials’. Why have we
“drift,” or more properly and significantly, speaking, a “terrain
de transport” 7. And still more pointedly, why do we find in the
vicinity, and at the same level, a large district, almost devoid of
drift foreign to itself-a district out of which everything has
been taken, and nothing carried in,                                -a,
                                               district in, which are

the applicability of the objections founded on these appearances,
and more especially as they gain force by the late discovery of
some remarkable fossils at Shepperton near Salisbury, and of the
vegetable remains buried in drift at Peasemarsh”. These, with
the beach of doubtful date at Brighton, although they alter
nothing as to the agencies of denudation, and of their mode of
operation, bespeak the lapse of more time, of a longer rest in the
intervals of violence; in fact, bespeak the occurrence of a diluvial
epoch rather than of a single catastrophe.        accept, therefore,                    I
these evidences as a    happy   corroboration of  my   views.    Par
oxysmal renewals of convulsion, moreover, accord well with my
sentiments respecting the frequent manufacture of “brick-earth”
on the spot, where it is found, by the amalgamation of the sands
and clays there, the impaction of gravels, whether of newer or
older date, and other signs of a tumultuary stratification, only
to be explained on the supposition of the repeated transit to and
fro of diluvial currents.

       absorbs about 10 times as much oxygen as does water.         M.
 Fernet.*, with the idea that this greater absorption was not
 owing entirely to the blood-globules (for many substances
 having only a weak affinity for gases may impart to water the
 property of absorbing them in a considerable degree), has made a
 series of experiments on the solubility of gases in certain saline
 solutions. He took successively solutions of different degrees of
 concentration of the principal salts found in blood, and deter
 mined their coefficient of absorption for gases, by means of an appa
 ratus specially contrived by him for the purpose. For a description
 of this the memoir itself must be consulted.         His experiments
  have as yet been confined to carbonic acid.      A solution of chlo
 ride of sodium containing 15 per cent. of the salt, diminishes the
  solubility of carbonic acid by about one half. With phosphate
 of soda the volume of gas absorbed increases in a very rapid
 manner with the strength of the solution. All the numbers
 hitherto obtained appear to show that the coefficient of absorp
 tion for carbonic acid in solution of phosphate of soda, is dedu
  cible from the coefficient of absorption in pure water, added to the
product of a constant coefficient multiplied by the strength of the
solution. . .     .      .                                                  is,

but as chlorine forms a hydrate at 10°C., the coefficient was
only determined between 10° C. and 40°C.
   The chlorine was determined by mixing a measured quantity
of the solution with a solution of iodide of potassium, and esti
mating the iodine set free.
   The absorption of sulphuretted hydrogen was made in a
similar manner, and the gas absorbed estimated by mixing the
solution with chloride of copper, and determining the sulphur
in the sulphide of copper precipitated. Schönfeld has also made
experiments on the absorption of mixtures of sulphurous acid
and carbonic acid, and of sulphurous acid and hydrogen, and
has found that the results obtained agreed well with the formulae
developed by Bunsen” for the absorption of gaseous mixtures.
   Carius+ has made a series of experiments on the absorption
of various gases in alcohol, and has shown that the law of ab
sorption is the same for this liquid. This is also the case with
mixtures of gases. Carius determined the absorbability of a
mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, of carbonic oxide
and marsh gas, of carbonic acid and hydrogen, of sulphurous
acid and hydrogen, and of a mixture of three gases, carbonic
oxide, marsh gas, and hydrogen.      In                          all

      Peligotº describes
                      a method for obtaining pure metallic ura
nium. He    prepares green protochloride of uranium by the action
of chlorine on a mixture of an oxide of uranium and carbon at a
high temperature.     A quantity of sodium sufficient to decom
pose the protochloride of uranium is placed in a porcelain crucible
and on this a layer of chloride of potassium; and this is covered
with a mixture of the same salt and of protochloride of uranium.
The crucible with      cover    placed   its
                                           another crucible, which

potassium has the object      rendering the action less active and
                                                       of

   “On the    Application    of Photography   to the   physionomic  and

Lunatic Asylum, has enabled him to make the peculiar application
of Photography, of which he gives an account in the present commu
nication.   He points out the advantages to be derived from photo
graphic portraits of the insane, as faithfully representing the features
of the disease in      different forms,  its   successive phases     the        or    its                                             in

obtained to be the radical of the butylic alcohol.  The density of the
fluid, and the temperature at which it distils, are also rather in
favour of this view.     It will be seem that 243° F. should be the
boiling-point of butyle if Frankland's determination of that of amyle
be correct, and Kopp's law hold with these bodies.
   A careful study of the papers already published on the radicals of
this series, shows that more than one anomaly appears to exist in
their physical properties, the gradations usually observed in homo
logous groups not being so distinctly marked as with most others,
and this fact somewhat impedes their identification.            The large
quantity of substance which becomes at our disposal from the source
mentioned, will, by facilitating the study, throw light on these points.
     I
     believe I shall be able to isolate at least four of the radicals, viz.
propyle, butyle, amyle, and caprotyle, from the coal distillate.      The
per-centage composition varying so little with the different homo
logues,       I
            rely chiefly on vapour density and products of decomposi
tion as the means of proving their presence.
   The hydrocarbons accompanying the radicals are also quite distinct
from the benzole series, as shown by the low density of the nitro
compound.       The latter is extremely difficult of reduction by sulphide
of ammonium or protacetate of iron, but it furnishes a volatile oily
alkaloid by distillation with an alcoholic solution of potash.
   The tedious purifications and the numerous operations required
before the substances can be obtained in a state of sufficient purity
for analysis from the coal distillate, will probably cause a consider
able period to elapse before a detailed account of      the bodies can           all
 bepublished.

   2. “On Volcanic Eruptions in Hawaii during the last sixteen
years.”    By the Rev. T. Coan. From the Foreign Office.
   In this letter, addressed to and transmitted by Mr. Consul-General
Miller, the Rev. Mr. Coan, who has been the resident Protestant
Missionary at Hilo for twenty-one years, and still resides there,
described some remarkable volcanic eruptions on the Island of
Hawaii (Owhyhee) of which he has been an eye-witness during
the last sixteen years: viz. the great eruption of Kilauea in 1840, of
Mauna Loa in 1843 and in 1852, of Kilauea in May and June 1855,
and lastly of Mauna Loa in August 1855. Mr. Coan added an
account of his visit to the summit crater of Mauna Loa in October
 1855; and referred to his several subsequent visits to the lava-stream
which has threatened Hilo.
   3.  “On    the late Volcanic Eruption of Mauna Loa.”             By Mr. “
Consul-General Miller. From the          Foreign  Office.
   In this letter, dated July 30, 1856, Mr. Miller referred to the
eruption as being still in a state of activity, and enclosed a Number
of the ‘Pacific Commercial Advertiser’ in which Mr. Coan's visit
to the crater in October 1855 was reported in full; and in which it
was stated that nearly an entire year had passed since the eruption
commenced in August 1855, and the flow, though diminished, was
still intense. Late advices state that the fresh or molten lava is not
met with until about three miles above the lowest point it reached
in November last, or about eight miles from Hilo. The lava now
appears to be spreading more laterally, bursting out through the
old crust and flowing off to the right and left.          At present there
is no   danger,   nor will there be    any  unless the    discharge  should
be materially increased.
   4. “On the occurrence of an Earthquake at Rhodes.”               By Mr.
Consul    Campbell.     From the   Foreign  Office.
   This communication referred to the severe shock of earthquake
which was felt at the Island of Rhodes on the 12th October at about
3 o'clock A.M. It lasted for nearly two minutes, and was accompanied
with great destruction of life and property.          Its first motion was
vertical, the second horizontal, and the third vertical. The shock
was felt also in the adjacent islands of Halki, Scarpantos, Cassos,
and Symi; also at Marmarizza on the coast opposite.

freshwater deposits of the Dobrudja, which were read before the

    1. “On some Freshwater Deposits in Euboea               and  Salonika.”
By Captain T. Spratt, F.G.S.
   In former communications to the Society the author had described
a series   of lacustrine limestone and marls, containing lignite,       and
overlaid by reddish unfossiliferous      loams and gravels, as occurring

 Samos, near Smyrna, and elsewhere in the Grecian Archipelago.
    In the present paper Captain Spratt described the occurrence
 of similar deposits on the northern part of Euboea, on the Locrian
 coast, and around the Bay of Salonika.      In connexion with the
 similar strata in other localities, in and around the AEgean, for
 merly described, these apparently lacustrine deposits indicate the
 existence of a great expanse of fresh water over the Levantine area
 during some tertiary period, probably continuing, according to
 Captain Spratt, from the eocene to the pliocene epoch.

By Dr. T. Richardson and E. J.                                J.   Browell, Esq. Communicated
by W. K. Loftus, Esq., F.G.S.
   This was a report on six samples of water from the Lake of Wan,
the small Lake of Ardchek situated to the east of the former, and
their vicinity, not far south-west of Ararat. They were brought home
by Mr. Kennet Loftus.         Of these, four specimens (two from the
Lake of Van and two from Ardchek) belong to a very limited class
of waters, such as are found in Hungary and Egypt, and which are
more or less rich in carbonate of soda.     A water from an acidulated
saline  spring  two miles south of Bitlis contained but traces of the
ordinary saline matter and a large proportion of lime and magnesia.
Hence it was inferred that probably this water originally came off a
dolomite, and subsequently passing through beds of gypsum, thereby
                                                                   by

globules of pure copper and silver were repelled by the electro-magnet.
   Thus potassium and sodium appear to be feebly magnetic.            If
they were feebly diamagnetic, as Faraday supposes, the relation
between the atomic volumes and the specific magnetism would not
be confirmed in their case.
Movement        of rotation due to magnetic induction in the metals,—sodium,
                        potassium, copper, silver, gold, &c.
   At the moment when magnetization commences or ceases, the
action of the electro-magnet upon sodium and potassium causes
energetic movements of repulsion and attraction, due to the produc
tion of induced currents in the mass. A more curious phaenomenon,
which must also be attributed to magnetic induction, is the rotation
which may be given to a mass of these metals by successive interrup

tions of the circuit of the electro-magnet.
   If a globule or cube of sodium, copper, silver, &c. be placed in
any part of the magnetic field, except in the vertical plane which
divides the polar surfaces into two equal parts, there is always a
rotation when the commutator is manoeuvred from right to left, and
vice versd, so as to close and interrupt the circuit or change                                                 its
direction.    The rotation      not continuous;          intermittent like

 alternates with straight movements taking place by jerks, like the

  XXIII.   On the Diffraction Spectrum.—Remarks on M.Eisenlohr’s
     recent Eaperiments.      By JoHN W. DRAPER, M.D., Professor
     of Chemistry  and   Physiology   in the University of New York.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
        WILL you permit me to direct the attention of your readers
            who may have been interested in the beautiful experi
   W W
 ments   published   by M. Eisenlohr in Poggendorff’s Annalen for
 June and    August   1856, to some researches on the same subject
 which   I made about fourteen years ago, and which were pub
 lished in 1844 in a work “On the Forces which produce the
 Organization of Plants.”        It is a matter of regret to me that
 M. Eisenlohr   does not appear to have been aware of those results,
or doubtless he would have perceived that some of the facts which
he supposes to be new have been known in America for many
y€arS.
    As the work to which I have referred is now out of print, you
will perhaps indulge me with space enough to give a short abs
tract of those portions of it bearing on the diffraction or inter
ference spectrum.
    I obtained, at first, that spectrum very much in the same man
ner that M. Eisenlohr has done, by passing a beam of light
directed through a vertical slit by a heliostat through a piece
of ruled glass at 12 feet distance, and then received it on an
achromatic lens of about 4 feet focus, which gave a sharply
defined spectrum on a ground glass or photographic surface.
Subsequently I found that it was much better to silver the ruled
surface with tin amalgam, in the manner of a looking-glass, and

thus employ a reflected spectrum.        It is far more brilliant
than the transmitted one, and the silvering acts so perfectly that
the most minute fixed lines may be seen.

                                   the results were illustrated                                                       by

the prismatic and interference spectrum, and          showing the                        of

I     will state      detail what

in such    a spectrum     the  yellow  occupies  the middle space, and
that the light grades off         one direction
                                           in        the red and        theto                            in

yellow,     sothat the wave-lengths for the extreme violet, the centre
of the yellow, and the extreme red, are                1},              as   1,           2.
   Now from the extreme violet                the yellow the spectrum

photographic subjects.          But from the yellow          the extreme red        to

Exley's, and lastly Mr. Stevelly's, the first being probably the

the  proof,  but there is     always    some break or chasm in the argu
ment which we must            bridge    over by an appeal to the ultimate
conception of space, and which may therefore as well be done at

external angles of every right-lined figure must always be equal
to four right angles, and therefore the interior angles of a tri
angle to two. My argument then would assume this form: that
if there be any result which the pure conception of space leaves
unexplained, we have not seized that conception aright, or
there is no basis for a complete science.          we have, no arbi                If

the principle of the sufficient reason to go upon. If a change of
position in space can alter the truth of a proposition respecting the
relation of lines and angles, or the parts of a specific form, or                                                      I

and the predictions of a theory in which it is assumed that the
office of the opake body is merely to stop a portion of the inci
dent light.    But when diffraction is produced by a fine grating,
the angle of diffraction is no longer restricted to be small; and
it becomes an open question whether the precise circumstances
of the diffraction may not have to be taken into account, and not
merely the form and dimensions of the apertures through which
the light passes.   If so, the problem becomes one of extreme
complexity. In my memoir on the Dynamical Theory of Dif
fraction, published in the ninth volume of the Cambridge Philo
sophical Transactions,             I investigated
                                         the problem on the hypo
thesis that in diffraction at a   large angle,  as we know to be the
case in diffraction at a small one, the office of the opake body is
merely to stop a portion of the incident light.        distinctly stated       I
this as a   hypothesis,  and     always      I
                                         regarded    it as rather pre
carious. I was guided by the following consideration. Let AB
be the section of a transparent interval by the plane of diffrac
tion, supposing for simplicity the diffraction to take place in air
or in a homogeneous medium, and not at the confines of two
different media; let AB =b; let 8 be the angle of diffraction,
and A the wave-length in the medium. Supposing the light to
be incident perpendicularly on the grating, the difference of
phase of the secondary waves which started from A, B, respect
ively, will be determined by the length of path b sin 8 within the
medium.       In experiment this will usually be a considerable
multiple of A. In the line AB take two points, A, B, equidistant
from A, B, respectively, and comprising between them as large a
multiple as possible of Acosec 8.                           If
                                           we suppose the influence
of the opake    body insensible at the distance AA’ or BB' from A
or B, the secondary waves which start from            points     the        all            in        in
terval A'B' will neutralize each other       interference,       by
                                                                that the                   so
whole effect will        be
                       due    the secondary waves which start from
                                        to

    doubted whether the influence          the  opake   body

have    to
         be taken into account.
   When diffraction takes place      the confines     at two different              of
media, suppose   air and glass, the problem       still further com       is
plicated. We may, however, apply the theory         which reference            to
has been made           on
                     the two extreme suppositions, first, that the
diffraction takes place wholly    the first, secondly, that
                                                 in              takes                          it
place wholly      in
                 the second medium.     The results       my own ex                  of
periments were very fairly represented       theory, the vibrationsby

being supposed perpendicular to the plane of polarization, pro
vided the diffraction be conceived to take place in the first
medium, or in other words, just before the light reaches the
grating; but they would not at              the hypothesis        all

considerations, founded        probable reasoning,on    show that the                         to

decided was the result obtained, that         seemed       me     strong     it                    to     a

perpendicular      the plane

   My first experiment was        the simplest kind. of         was    win                 It          a
ter's day. The differential thermometer was placed                 the out                       on
side      window where the temperature was below the freezing
           of
            a
point. The effect measured                            by
                                     the scale (which merely divided
the stem into equal parts) was 53°.            was then placed      It  the                            on
inside      of
          the window,    where the   temperature   was about      70°,  and

to my surpris: the effect rose to 115°.      The experiment was
many times repeated with similar results, although varying some
what in amount from the different degrees of brightness in the sun.
The change in the temperature of the air was still to be added,
and the conclusion seemed to be irresistible, that the sun's rays
in passing into the heated room acquired a temperature that
they did not derive from the sun.
   The experiment was next repeated with different temperatures
of the room, and it was found that the intensity of the rays de
pended upon the heat of the room.   Indeed in the coldest weather
              I
in winter could    impart to them a power which belonged to a
summer's sun.
   At a later period, when the circumstances were changed and
the heat on the outside had become greatest, the indications of
 the instrument were reversed.        The high temperature of the
 summer rays was in a great measure lost or dissipated on enter
 ing into a cool room. There they had no greater power than
had been found at similar temperatures in the winter.
    For the purpose of a more accurate investigation of the sub
ject,   Iprocured a glass shade or receiver about 10 inches in dia
 meter and 22 in height.     A copper base was adapted to it with
a  groove   around the outer edge, into which the receiver fitted;
and when it was filled with dry ashes, the point was thereby
rendered sufficiently air-tight.    It was supported by legs so high
 that a spirit-lamp could be placed under                         it,
                                                   and any required
 temperature given             to
                        the air within.
    A  second receiver of the same size was sometimes used for the
 purpose     ofsimultaneous comparison.      The air within       was                  it
 cooled     by
             inserting  tin canister filled with frigorific mixtures.

 The thermometers were supported within the receivers, and thus
at  the same time the same rays could         tested         be

  1st.  That the heat in the sun's rays is not uniform, such as
would   proceed  from a great heated body of uniform intensity,
nor is it such as was received from the canister when kept at the
same degree of heat, but that it varies and is dependent upon
the temperature of the air,
   2ndly. That the effects of the sun’s rays upon the thermometer
at the different degrees of heat in the receiver is the same that
has usually been observed at similar temperatures in the open
air. It is easy, by changing the heat within the receiver, to
imitate the power of the sun’s rays that has been observed at any
time or in any place; indeed at the same time the same rays
may have in one receiver the burning heat of a summer's sun,
and in the other only the feeble action of winter.
    3rdly. It appears that heat does not travel along with the rays
of light, as has been usually supposed, but that it is received, or
parted with, lost or acquired, according to the temperature of the
place that the rays illuminate. . The same rays that within the
receiver have the high intensity belonging to summer, on passing
to the outside are reduced again to a winter's temperature,
    In view of these results, it seems to me to accord better with
the facts to attribute to the sun’s rays, perhaps to            light,                        all   an
action    ofsome kind       such heaton   they come         contact with,

174                      Mr. A. Cayley               on the Theory           of the
third tree, and the fourth tree of fig. 3. To derive fig. 8 (bis)
from fig. 3, we must fill up the trees of fig. 3 with U at the root
and R, Q, P at the other knots in every possible manner, subject
only to the restriction, that, reckoning up from the extremity of
a free branch to the root, there must not be any transposition
in the order of the symbols RQP, and taking care to admit only
distinct trees. Thus the first tree of fig. 3 might be filled up in
six ways; but the trees so obtained are considered as one and
the same tree, and we have only the first tree of fig. 3 (bis).
Again, on account of the restriction, the fourth tree of fig. 3 can
be filled up in one way only, and we have thus the sixth tree of
fig. 3 (bis).     And thus, in general, each figure of the second set
can be formed at once from the corresponding figure of the first
set; or when the first set of figures is given, the expression for
YX..     QPU can be formed directly without the assistance of the
expression for the preceding symbol                                   X...
                                                         QPU; the number
of terms for the nth figure of the second set is obviously
ºl. 2. 3... n, and consequently it is only necessary to count the
terms in order to ascertain that no admissible mode of filling up
has been omitted.
    The number of parts in any one of the figures of the first set
is much smaller than the number of parts in the corresponding
figure of the second set; and the law for the number of parts,
i. e. for the number A, of the trees with n branches, is a very
singular one. To obtain this law, we must consider how the
trees with n branches can be formed by means of those of a
smaller number of branches.             A tree with n branches has either
a single main branch, or else two main branches, three main
branches, &c.            ...   to
                             main branches.                           If
                                                      the tree has one main
branch,       can

XXIX.        Remarks on a passage in the President’s Address delivered
    at the Anniversary Meeting of the Geological Society of London
    on the 15th of February, 1856.         By the Rev. Prof. Sedgwick,
    M.A., F.R.S. &c.

                                                                              **
       GENTLEMEN,
Turpublication
             remarks which
                        were
                                follow might be thought unworthy of
                               they  not written in defence of a paper
which appeared in your Journal for October and November
 1854. Mr. Hamilton, in his Anniversary Address, has attacked
the conclusions       I  vindicated in that paper.       As, however, he
appears neither to have learnt, by a study in the field, what
are the great successive physical groups in the older divisions
of British palaeozoic rocks, nor to have more than a partial
and one-sided knowledge of their history,           I  should not perhaps
have been called upon to notice his statements, so far as they are
purely geological, either in the way of praise or blame. But he
has at the same time charged me with having irregularly gained
possession of that which was the property of the Geological

  the Anniversary Meeting                       of the    Geological            Society, 1856.                177
Society, and “with having [in your Journal for October and
November 1854] published what must have known that I had  I
no right to publish.”  These are grave charges, and in my                                                        in
terpretation of them, they involve nothing less than a severe
censure on my moral character.     For unfair dealing is on                                                      all
occasions mean and    disgraceful;  and never more disgraceful
than when       done against the known regulations
                   it  is                                public                              of     a

offered; and at length was informed (in a letter from Mr. Ha

threshold was thought in old times to be an evil omen. When,
in the same sentence, he professes to correct my memory, he has
perhaps shown some lack of memory himself; for did not simply                    I
state (in my letter to the Editorsof the Philosophical Magazine and
Journal, August 20, 1854) “that the Council refused to publish
my paper;” I expressly added the facts, of which he generously
reminds me (as if I had studiously kept them back or forgotten
them): viz. “ that the Council were willing to print my paper
after suppressing the discussion on classification and nomencla
                      I
ture.” Was called upon (in the letter just quoted) to make any
allusion to Mr. Hamilton’s mistakes in the previous month of
May, or to the correspondence that had arisen out of them?                                                   I
think the very contrary; and that          should have done much   I
wrong had          I
                entered upon the facts of the case more fully than
was done in my letter of August 1854.
    To the facts given in the latter portion of the previous extract
I  have nothing to oppose, and                           I
                                     only wish to deal with the con
clusions that are drawn from them. At the time my paper was
sent to the Editors of this Journal (August 20, 1854), did not                                  I
believe that any part of it had been read in eatenso before the
Geological Society; I did not believe that it had been accepted
by the Council in         integrity; neither did
                                    its               believe that           I                               it
had been publicly discussed        submitted        or

 days.  But the languor of ill-health so much retarded the simple
task of revision (undertaken in the hope of making a very                                       ill
written MS. legible in my absence), that the concluding sheets
of my paper were not received by the Secretary before the 27th
of March. It was finally brought before the Society on the 3rd
of May, while I was in residence at Norwich, and incapable of
leaving it for so much as a single day.   I make no complaint on
account of this  long delay.  Nay,  I am willing to believe that the
delay was meant in courtesy to myself, and that the President
waited in the hope that I might at length be enabled to attend
the meeting when my paper was to be read.
                                                       I
    Very soon after the 3rd of May had a letter from Mr. Ha
milton, informing me that my first paper had been laid before
the Society, but that my second paper had not been read, and
could not be published in the Journal.          It appeared to me at
the time (and        I
                   think quite naturally), that in this letter there
was an insinuation of something very like unfair dealing on my
part: viz. that while professing to send a paper which              had                  I
offered to the Society for their first meeting in November 1853,
I  had virtually changed             its

in the extract from the Anniversary Address.
   In concluding my comment on this extract,                 have to apolo                  I
gise for one great mistake of omission, for which hereby express                                I
my sincere regret.—I ought to have thanked Mr. Hamilton for
his ample and courteous apology, made after he had discovered
his mistake about the integrity of my paper.               Not that then                                            I
grudged the grateful words of courtesy; for have ever regarded                        I
him as a well-informed, honourable, and truth-loving man; and
spite of my plain and homely words, he will not,                trust, think                         I
me   guilty of  any personal  disrespect   towards him.          differ from                        If I
a truth-loving man on questions of fact or opinion, the greatest
respect        I
            can pay him is to tell him plainly what are the points
on which we differ. My apology for the fault of omission                                                                    is,
that I  was suffering during the whole month               May 1854 from                  of
the lassitude      long-continued ill-health.

what  I  thought      very  perverse
                              a       misinterpretation        my conduct;                       of
writing was hateful          me; and when my paper came back
                                       to                                                                               I
threw     it   one side, after just turning over
                   on                                      pages, and then                its
dismissed the subject from my thoughts.

Ricimoleic acid.            Sebate of potash.    Caprylic alcohol.
  But if the  operation be effected at a low  temperature,   there is
produced a mixture of caprylic aldehyde and caprylic acid; and
the residue contains a new acid, differing from sebacic acid.
This acid is also produced along with caprylic aldehyde in the
dry distillation of the salts of ricinoleic acid,—
            C36 H34 OS           =  C16 H16O2       +             C20H18O4,
          Ricinoleic acid.       Caprylic aldehyde.               New acid.
   Caprylic aldehyde is a colourless, very refrangible body, which
is lighter than water, and boils at 171 degrees.    It reduces am
moniacal nitrate of silver, when heated absorbs oxygen with great
rapidity, and combines with alkaline bisulphites. Treated with
mitric acid it yields the same products as caprylic alcohol, and is
converted by potash into a brown viscous matter which is not
volatile.
   Goessmann           and Scheven         found in the earth-nut oil a new
member of the oleic acid series, to which they gave the name
hypogaeic acid.    This has now been subjected to a further                                     in

organic acid, the reaction will be thus expressed:—
                 2RO HO-HPCl3–CIH +PO3, HO +2RCl.
The preparation by this process, using quantities required by
equation, is effected with as much ease as the preparation of nitric
acid, and the product obtained corresponds very closely with the
theoretical requirements.
     M. Boullet”has found that several nitro-acids analogous with
nitrobenzoic acid are reduced to the corresponding amido-acids
by the action of acetate of iron; and that acetate of iron acts
upon the aethers of the nitro-acids and produces the aethers of
the corresponding amido-acids.

  XXXI.      On the Problem of the In-and-circumscribed Triangle.
     By   the Rev. GEoRGE SALMoN, Trinity College, Dublin”.
Th;        following was suggested by Mr. Cayley’s paper in the
        January Number of the Philosophical Magazine, which           I
have just met with.
                                                                -
    Let it be required to find the envelope of the third side of a
triangle inscribed in a conic U, and two of whose sides touch a
conic W.
   Let the condition that AU+V should represent two right
lines be
                      VX^+OX*-i- 0x4-V"-0;
then since the value of A plainly cannot depend on the particular
axes to which the equations are referred, it follows, that, no mat
ter how the equations are transformed, the ratios of the coeffi
cients of the powers of X in the equation just written remain
unaltered.
    Let now the sides of the triangle in any position be a, y, z,
 then the equations of the conics admit of being transformed into
    U=2ary-H2y2+2az=0,
    W =<U+017F>*a*-i-m”y”--nºz”—2lmary–2mmyz—2nlza-2Aay=0;
and it is plain that the equation
                             AU +    W =0
 represents a conic touched by the third side 2.
    But in this case we find, if l-i-m-i-n=p, lmn=r,
   V=2, G)=–p°–2A, G'=2p(2r-t-An),                 V'--(2r-HAn)",
 whence
                    4G) V'—G)”=8A(2r-HAn)”;
and the equation    AU+W =0 may be written
                    {4G)V'—G)”}U–4VV'V=0.
    The coefficients in this equation      being invariants, it follows
 that the conic which we have    proved    is touched by the third side
is a fired conic.
    We can in like manner find the locus of the vertex of a tri
angle circumscribed about V, and two of whose vertices move
along U. In this case the equations may be transformed into
             U=2&y--2/2+22a: +A2°,
             W=lºw”--m”y°+ n°2°–2lmay—2mmyz–2nlza,
and we have
      v=2—A,         G  = —p"4-21mA,         G'=4pr,    v'=–4r”.

     Again,        let   F=0        be   the equation            of   the covariant conic which
passes through the points                      of                   of  common tangents

                                               –4rn(1—A).
Hence   canit            be   seen that the coefficient                of       2*   vanishes identically

He   observes, that, unlike  the methods followed in his former me
moir, and the solutions there employed, which are quite rigorous,
the methods of the present memoir depend upon developments into
series, the strictness of which has been contested by some mathema
ticians; but that passing over these difficulties, he has solved the
:
famous problem, the solution of which has been vainly sought after
for the last two hundred years, because on the above-mentioned
equation depends the integration of the generally linear equation of
any order whatever of two variables, and consequently the whole
Integral Calculus.     The solution first obtained by the author, and
        he afterwards exhibits under a variety

 applying heat for a short time, to set in repose. On spontaneous

waves of which lengths are not infinitely great multiples of the steps

spiral fibres, or a solid with spiral passages through it of steps not
less than the forty-millionth of an inch, or a crystal with a right
handed or a left-handed geometrical arrangement of parts of some such
lineal dimensions as the forty-millionth of an inch, might be certainly
expected to cause either a right-handed or a left-handed rotation of

   The interpretation of this solution, when w is taken equal to the
component of the earth's angular velocity round a vertical at the
locality, affords a full explanation of the curious phaenomena which
have been observed by many in failing to repeat Foucault's admirable
pendulum experiment.       When the mode of suspension is perfect, we
have A=0; but in many attempts to obtain Foucault's result, there
has been an asymmetry in the mode of attachment of the head of
the cord or wire used, or there has been a slight lateral unsteadiness
in the bearings of the point of suspension, which has made the
observed motion be the same as that expressed by the preceding
solution, where A has some small value either greater than or less
than w, and n has the value                                    The only          case, however, that
                                                        #.
need be considered as illustrativeof the subject of the present com
munication is that in which w is very great in comparison with n.

    very nearly equal to one another; but p is rather less than a, as the
    following approximate expressions derived from their exact values
    expressed       above,   show:—
                                   1   A*        1 A*                         1     X*      , 1   X*

    Hence the form of solution simply expresses that circular vibrations
    of the pendulum in the contrary directions have slightly different
    periods, the shorter,              2.

of electricity, but on the number of attracting points called into
operation by what is usually considered as the attracted body. Two
circular discs of very light wood, of 5 inches diameter, being care
fully prepared in a lathe, were divided into six concentric rings,
including a central plate of about an inch in diameter. The attract
ive force on each pair of rings was determined by means of the
electrical balance and carefully noted; the force was as the several
opposed areas; and when the series was combined into one plate, the
force was the sum of the forces of the respective rings; when the
attractive forces of circular plates equal in area to the several rings
respectively were examined, the force was the same as that exhibited
by the two rings whose area was the same; hence it is inferred that
whether the charge operates from the circumference or near the
centre, the attractive force is the same. Two rings combined exhibit
forces equal to the sum of the forces taken separately; and when
the force is examined between the plates or the several rings and a
plane circular area of large and continuous surface, the forces are no
greater than that between two plates or rings of equal area.     When
the distances between the attracting surfaces or the quantities of the
electrical accumulation varied, then the force was as the square of the
accumulation directly, and as the square of the distances inversely.
   The author extends these experiments to spheres of different
diameters. He had shown in a former paper, that, taking the attract
ive force to be as the areas directly, and as the squares of the

    The vertebrae here described, thirteen in number, indicated by
 their size a serpent of between 10 and 12 feet in length.             They were
 discovered some      years  since  by   Capt.    Spratt,   R.N.,   in the fresh
 water tertiary beds at the Promontory of Karabournou.                 Supposing
them to have been derived from other            parts  than the anterior fourth
part of the trunk, they resemble in the length of the hypapophysis
the vertebrae of Crotalus, Vipera, and Natria ; which they also re

By    J.    W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
   In March 1856 Mr. Salter communicated the discovery of traces
of Annelides and probable fragments of a Trilobite, accompanied by
ripple-marks, in the sandstone-beds of the eastern part of the Long
mynd.    During the last summer he collected many more materials
for the elucidation of the palaeontology of the Longmynd rocks; and
in the present paper described the occurrence of abundant Annelide
markings, referable to two species (one of them new), throughout
a mile of thickness in the lower portion of the nearly vertical shales,
sandstones, and flagstones of the Longmynd, from Church Stretton
to the Portway.
   Wave- or surf-marks, ripples, sun-cracks, and rain-prints were
also described as occurring at several localities on the surfaces of
these laminated rocks of the Longmynd.
   Arenicolites sparsus was proposed as the name for the new species
of double worm-hole above alluded to. Mr. Salter also adverted to
the discovery of numerous vertical worm-tubes in the quartz rock of
the Stiper Stones.    These he believes to be the same as the Scolithus
tinearis of Hall, found in the Potsdam sandstone of North America.
   He proposes the term Arenicolites for               all
                                                fossil worm-holes with
double openings, and Helminthites for the superficial trails.

             some Fossiliferous Ironstone occurring       the North    on
Downs,”     By Joseph Prestwich, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.

 212                      Geological   Society —
 the summit     of the North Downs from Folkestone to Dorking s
 few masses of sand, gravel, and ironstone, which present a certain
 regularity of structure and uniformity among themselves, and are
 clearly different from and of a later age than the outliers of eocene
 tertiaries on the same hills.      Mr. Prestwich had long been ac
 quainted with these ferruginous sands at Vigo Hill, where they are
 about 30 feet thick; and at Paddlesworth near Folkestone, where
they are even better developed; but though the ironstone fragments
 derived from these beds are frequently found dispersed about the
Downs, it was long before he met with any fossils in these beds,
                                                                    º
with the exception of a piece of fossil wood pierced by Teredo, and
 an obscure cast of a bivalve shell, at Paddlesworth.        In December
 1854, however, some blocks of gritty ferruginous sandstone
casts of shells were communicated to the author by Messrs. W.
 Harris and Rupert Jones, who had met with the specimens in some
sandpipes in the Chalk at Lenham, eight miles east of Maidstone, and
regarded them as belonging to the Basement Bed of the London
Clay. This fossiliferous ironsand on close examination yielded casts
of bivalve and univalve shells belonging to nearly thirty genera,
besides indications of Lunulites, Diadema, &c. The presence of a
 Terebratula very like T. grandis, with several species of Astarte, and
afterwards his finding a large Mya-shaped shell, led Mr. Prestwich
to conclude that these sandy beds belonged to the Lower Crag,
Mr. Searles Wood, to whom the fossils have been submitted, states
that, as far as the evidence goes, he thinks they may with some pro
bability be referred to the Lower Crag period; the occurrence of a
Pyrula more especially strengthening this view. Mr. Prestwich
assigns without any doubt this shelly ironstone to the ferruginous
sands above referred to, and points to the peculiar concentric arrange
ment of the contents of the sandpipes of the locality in question as
definitely indicating (in accordance with the observations he formerly
published in the Society's Journal) the former existence of horizontal
strata of 1. (lowermost) loam with flints,        2. greenish sands with
ironstone nodules,—3, yellow and reddish sands,-superposed on the
bare chalk, after the eocene beds were for the most part denuded, and
before the sandpipes were formed, into which these overlying beds
were here and there let down and thereby preserved when further
denuding agencies removed the later tertiary beds.                        +
    Regarding then the outliers of ferruginous sands and sandstones
above referred to as of the age of the Lower Crag, Mr. Prestwich
points out the relative position of beds of similar age and of not dis-,
similar structure, on the Downs between Calais and Boulogne, also
on the top of Cassel Hill near Dunkirk, at Lessines, at Louvain, and
at Diest in Belgium.     This extensive range of Crag-beds to the south
of the typical Suffolk area, and their considerable elevation above the
sea, are of course matters of great interest, not only as pointing out
the relative age of some of the drifts, but especially as giving us a still
nearer date to limit the denudation of the Weald, and indicating
marginal sea-beds now stretching far inland and ranging once
probably over the Wealden area, possibly connected too with the

Carentan beds of Normandy.     With regard to the denudation of the
Weald, Mr. Prestwich suggests that, the anticlinal axis of the Weald
having been somewhat raised during the cretaceous period, and the
lower tertiaries partly constructed from its débris and gradually
                        area,   itswas again denuded

      2. “On the Copper-mines of Namaqualand.”        By R. N. Rubidge,
  Esq., M.B. In a letter to Sir R. I. Murchison, F.G.S.
     On his examination of Namaqualand, in 1854, Dr. Rubidge found
  that the conditions under which the metalliferous rocks occur there
  differed from any which he had previously known, and that they did
  not take the character of lodes, as usually understood.        On the
  contrary, he found that all the runs of ore, in at least the more
  southern part of this mining district, present externally an iron
  stained surface, the rock being different from the gneiss on either
  side, and that the general south dip of the rocks changes in the centre
  of the run to the opposite direction, and then recovers the former
  direction for a variable distance from half a mile to twelve miles,
  when similar changes of dip occur, with or without metalliferous
 indications.     These linear alterations of dip, or axes, present two
 chief varieties, termed by the author, respectively, “axes of change,”
 and “axes of disturbance.”     Some of the axes appear to be branched.
 The surface of the metalliferous runs is much cross-fissured and
 decomposed; the rocks are stained of a bright green colour by
 silicate of copper, and lumps of oxide of copper are scattered on the
 surface, or in the fissures. When these are followed downwards,
 they often widen at first into largish veins, which at depths varying
 from 4 to 25 feet generally contract, sometimes terminating abruptly.
 At a greater depth purple sulphuret of copper occurs, and still lower
 copper-pyrites, either in fissures between masses of slightly decom
 posed granite, or diffused in grains throughout the granite.        Dr.
 Rubidge described the relations of the Springbok, Koperberg, Con
 cordia, Hoeklip, Rietburg, and other mines, to the several metallife
rous axes, as far as his opportunities had enabled him to form an
 opinion; and then offered some remarks on the probable origin of
 the succession of the ores observed in the axes, several of the facts
 connected with them pointing, in his opinion, to the agency of water,
 and perhaps of magneto-electrical force as having produced many of
 the phaenomena.      The mines to the northward, near Henkries and
Pella, present different conditions of the metalliferous rocks to those
of Springbok and the southern mines. In the Orange River county,
hornblendic, micaceous, and other schistose rocks are penetrated by
granitic dykes and masses; and the copper-ores occur in small
masses, disseminated through the crystalline veins, and sometimes
in the rocks themselves.

   March 10, 1856.-A paper was read by L. Barrett, Esq., “On the
Distribution of the Mollusca on the Coast of Norway.”   -   (Wide Annals
of Nat. Hist. May 1856.)
   In this the author observed, that when the fauna of the coast of Nor
way is compared with that of the other side of the North Atlantic, a
great difference will at once be perceived, not only in the number of
species, but also in the different distribution of northern and south
ern types; the Mollusca of Greenland being peculiarly arctic, those
of Scandinavia a mixture of southern and northern species.         In the
southern part of Norway we find the species living on our coasts
abundant; but they become rarer as we go north, their place being
supplied by arctic forms.    Many of the northern species have a great
geographical    range, at which we need not be surprised when we
consider their great antiquity, many of them having existed since the
pliocene period; and, in the author's opinion, whenever we find a
species with a great geographical range, we may at once infer that
it has continued to live from a remote period. It is extremely diffi
cult, according to the present state of the currents in the northern
seas, to account for the wide distribution of arctic shells on this side
of the North Atlantic; but when we consider that at not a very
distant period the temperature and other conditions of this area
were totally different, that a cold climate prevailed, certainly accom
panied by a current setting from the north (as is fully proved by the
fact that boulders are always found nearly south of the moun
tain ranges from which they have been originally transported), and
that many of the shells are found fossil in the Sicilian tertiaries,
this wide distribution may be fully accounted for.        As these frigid
conditions were gradually altering to more genial ones, those species
requiring a lower temperature would gradually die out, and only con
tinue to exist in higher latitudes.    The littoral and shallow water
species would be most affected by such an alteration of climate;
and while the fauna of the littoral and laminarian zones would be
entirely changed,—the shells composing that fauna replaced by other
species, those living in the deep sea would continue to exist, per
haps at a greater depth, mingled with the species brought in with
the new physical conditions of the area.         This we know to be the
case; for while the northern littoral shells, such as Mya truncata,
&c., are found only fossil in Sicily, many of the deep-sea arctic species
that existed there when those fossils were alive are still found living
in the deeper parts of the Mediterranean.
   The same thing occurs on our coasts, where the arctic littoral
or shallow-water shells, as Astarte arctica, Tellina prowima, Natica
helicoides, &c., which are found in shallow water on the Scandi
navian or Greenland coasts, are now rare as deep-sea shells, and that
in the same area in which they were formerly abundant as shallow
water species. Some species are capable of enduring great differences.

of Greenland as on our own shores.
     Itis not difficult to account for the presence of the southern species
on the coast of Norway, as the Gulf-stream sets directly along the
coast, warming                   its
                        waters, and rendering them habitable for species
requiring     moderately high temperature. The great abundance and

  Dec.   8–Mr.   Humphry read a paper “On the relations of the
Vertebrate Skeleton to the Nervous System.”                     -
   He pointed out that the central parts, both of the skeleton
and of the nervous system, are composed of segments placed in
front of, or above one another: those of the former being called
“vertebrae,” those of the latter “ganglia;” that the vertebrae
correspond     with the ganglia, each vertebra having             appropriate                 its
ganglion;    and further, that the processes,             nerves, emanating      or
from the central ganglionic portion             the nervous system corre

perfectly insulated.  I stopped at the induced current of the fourth

undergoes a polar decomposition;          the galvanometer acquires a

zation, and these three pieces of apparatus always act concordantly,
whatever be the direction of the primary current, which may be
changed at pleasure by the commutator of Ruhmkorff's apparatus.

  At the recent Meeting        German Naturalists of    Vienna, Prof.               at
Heiss    Münster (Westphalia) gave the results
          of                                       his observations on       of
zodiacal light (with reference     Prof. Argelander's memoir

determined by a series of observations.        The variations in its inten
sity probably depend on atmospheric changes only.              Prof. Heiss
expressed his desire that further observations should be made, and
proposed, as a problem still requiring solution, the question whether
the phaenomena of zodiacal light observed at different stations are
not really different from each other. The phaenomenon may be alike
perceived in the evening and in the morning; e.g. on February 3,
1856, when in the evening the light was very conspicuous in the
western part of the firmament, and appeared again, nine hours later,
in the eastern part; its figure being an ellipse with a major axis of
116°, and a minor axis of 33°.            It has not yet been possible to
observe the polarization of the zodiacal light on account of its feeble
intensity.
    Prof. Heiss pointed out the desirability of corresponding observa
tions on the aurora borealis, especially for determining the distance
of these two peculiar lights. He himself had made the so-called
“rays” of the aurora borealis a particular subject of observation,
making use, for the grouping of the results, of diaphanous maps to
protect the eyes against the excessive intensity of the light. The
aurora borealis is known to be visible at great distances; e.g. the
same phaenomenon was observed by Prof. Heiss at Aix-la-Chapelle,
and by M. Schmidt at Naples.           Although the last aurorae boreales
 were  very  feeble, there is no reason to suppose a general diminution of
 the phaenomenon,      or the beginning of a period of periodical decrease.
    Prof. Heiss has observed the      phaenomenon   of falling stars conti
 nuously    since   1849,   during  the whole course of the year.      The
 results of his observations have been graphically represented on
 wooden tables of a peculiar construction, and so placed that they
 exactly answer to the region of the firmament actually before the
 eye of the observer.       Falling stars observed at the same time at dif
 ferent  places   are not always identical; they may be distinguished
 from each other by means of several geometrical constructions.
 The igneous globular meteor of February 3, 1846, was seen at places
 very distant from each other.        According to Prof. Heiss's observa
 tions, it took its origin at a vertical height of 30 German (about
  150 English) miles above the St. Gothard, it progressed towards the
 north of France and disappeared above Chalons, passing through a
 distance of 54 German miles within the space of a few seconds.
 Another igneous globe was seen in August 1856 at Brussels, Namur,
 and other places; first appearing at a height of 10 German miles
 near Namur, and disappearing at a height of 3 German miles: its
 real diameter was 300 Paris feet.
    Prof. Heiss expressed a wish that notice might be given him of
 any phaenomena of this kind wherever such may have been observed,
 and stated that his own observations on falling stars did not fall far
 short of 9000.

 presented a gold medal, accompanied by a prize of about 3500 francs
 (£140), to M. Schoenbein for his investigations on ozonized oxygen.

 to coincide exactly with the magnetic meridian, and the distance
between the string and the needle was about the twelfth of an
inch. The string was now thrown into the state of resonance by

Harris has continued his opposition to an established law of electrical
heat, without, as is necessary, describing minutely the experiments

impossible to assign a reason for the remarkable result which his

               XXXV.              On the Conservation of Force.
              By Professor             FARADAy,          D.C.L., F.R.S.*
     ARIOUS      circumstances induce me at the present moment
        to put forth a consideration regarding the conservation of
force.   I                                      I
           do not suppose that can utter any truth respecting
it that has not already presented itself to the high and piercing
intellects which move within the exalted regions of science; but
the course of my own investigations and views makes me think
that the consideration may be of service to those persevering
labourers (amongst whom                    I
                                endeavour to class myself), who,
occupied in the comparison of physical ideas with fundamental
principles, and continually sustaining and aiding themselves by
experiment and observation, delight to labour for the advance of
natural knowledge, and strive to follow it into undiscovered
regions.
   There is no question which lies closer to the root of          phy                  all
sical knowledge   than that which     inquires  whether force can                              be
                                                    to of
destroyed    or
             not. The progress          the strict science     modern             of
times has tended more and more           produce the conviction that
 “force can neither        created nor destroyed,” and
                              be                                render            to

               or                                          admit that   be   to

     were annihilated
annihilated at the same time; so that the case of a lone particle
and that where different distances only are considered become
one, being identical with each other in their consequences.    And
as removal of B to an infinite distance is as regards A annihila
tion of B, so removal to the smallest degree is in principle the
same thing with displacement through infinite space: the small
est increase in distance involves annihilation of power; the an
nihilation of the second particle, so as to have A alone, involves
no other consequence in relation to gravity; there is difference
in degree, but no difference in the character of the result.
   It seems hardly necessary to observe, that the same line of
thought grows up in the mind if we consider the mutual gravi
tating action of one particle and many.       The particle A will
attract the particle B at the distance of a mile with a certain
degree of force; it will attract a particle C at the same distance
of a mile with a power equal to that by which it attracts B; if
myriads of like particles be placed at the given distance of a mile,
A will attract each with equal force; and if other particles be ac

tricity and magnetism,     we find great latitude of assumption;
and necessarily  so, for the powers become more and more com
plicated in their conditions. But still there is no apparent desire
to let loose the force of the principle of conservation, even in
those cases where the appearance and disappearance of force may
seem most evident and striking.    Electricity appears when there
is consumption of no other force than that required for friction;
we do not know how, but we search to know, not being willing
to admit that the electric force can arise out of nothing. The
 two electricities are developed in equal proportions; and having
 appeared, we may dispose variously of the influence of one upon
 successive portions of the other, causing many changes in rela
tion, yet never able to make the sum of the force of one kind in
the least degree exceed or come short of the sum of the other.
 In that necessity of equality we see another direct proof of the
conservation of force, in the midst of a thousand changes that
require to be developed in their principles before we can consider
this part of science as even moderately known to us.

as in the cases of magnetism, static electricity, and perhaps gra

in part, it will lead us to look for the new condition or form of
force which should result, and to develope             equivalency      theits                              to

    Some are much surprised that should, as they think, venture
to oppose the conclusions of Newton: but here there is a mis
take.    I  do not oppose Newton on any point; it is rather those
who sustain the idea of action at a distance that contradict him.
Doubtful as I ought to be of myself,                         I
                                                am certainly very glad to
feel that my convictions are in accordance with his conclusions.
At the same time, those who occupy themselves with such mat
ters ought not to depend altogether upon authority, but should
find reason within themselves, after careful thought and consi
deration, to use and abide by their own judgement.                    Newton
himself, whilst referring to those who were judging his views,
speaks of such as are competent to form an opinion in such mat
ters, and makes a strong distinction between them and those who
were incompetent for the case.
    But after all, the principle of the conservation of force may by
some be denied.        Well, then, if it be unfounded even in              ap                     its
plication      the smallest part                             force, the proof

must    be  within our   reach,  for      physical  science      so.      that       is          In
case, discoveries        large
                           as        larger than any yet made may
                                            or                                                          be
anticipated.      I  did not resist the search for them, for               one                    no
can   do    harm,   but  only  good,   who works with            earnest and         an
 truthful spirit       in
                       such    direction.     But let         not admit the     us

The following analyses were made by me, three years since, of
the waters of the St. Lawrence, and                        its

and will serve     illustrate several

little noticed.
    The waters were collected      the close     the winter season,

rapid current prevented the ice from forming.                  The water         the                of
Ottawa was collected                 on

the remaining part must, like the lime and magnesia, be regarded

in the following Table calculated the earthy bases and the excess
of alkalies as carbonates, thus giving necessarily an excess in the

mance  of soda, sulphuric acid, and chlorine, which distinguishes
it from the Ottawa. It is an interesting geographical feature of
these two rivers, that they each pass through a series of great
lakes in which the waters are enabled to deposit their mechanical
impurities, and thus are rendered remarkably clear and trans
parent.
   The presence of large amounts of silica in river-waters is a
fact but recently established.           Until the late analyses by H.
St.-Claire Deville of the rivers of France+, the silica in water
had generally been overlooked wholly or in great part; and, as
he suggests, had, from the mode of analysis, been confounded
with gypsum. (The purity of the silica in              my determinations            all
was established               by
                        the blowpipe.)      The importance             agri                          in         an

 250                        Prof. Schönbein                    on the Connevion        of
        That oxygen also belongs to the number of allotropic elements
                   I
   may now, think, be considered as certain, as the allotropism of
   carbon, of sulphur, phosphorus, &c.               And     have repeatedly      I
   endeavoured to       show,   that not    only  free,  but also chemically
   combined      oxygen   may   exist in two different allotropic modifica
   tions; as chemically active and passive, as ozonized and common
   oxygen, or as O and O.
       With respect to the second equivalent of oxygen in peroxide
   of hydrogen, there appears to me to be no doubt that it exists in
   the ozonized condition; from the simple reason, indeed, that it
  produces oxidizing actions, which free ozonized, but not common
  oxygen, is able to effect.
       Of free O, my experiments have shown that it may be con
  verted into O not only by heating, but also by contact with
  certain substances; as, for example, carbon, the oxides of the
  noble metals, the peroxides of lead, manganese, iron, &c., at
  ordinary temperatures.                                                    o
      If  now, as       I
                      assume, peroxide of hydrogen be really HO-HO,
  if the free O can be changed into O by carbon, peroxide of man
  gamese, &c., and further, if it be the fact that carbon, &c. changes
  HO + O into HO-HO, it appears to me in the highest degree
 probable that the ultimate cause of the catalysis of the peroxide
 of hydrogen effected by the above substances lies in the conver
 sion of the O of this compound into O.
      It is well known that water and common oxygen cannot be
 united to form the peroxide, and that the latter must exist in the
 O condition to be capable of uniting with HO. That oxygen
                                      is its

and the noble metals and their oxides act in an exactly similar
manner. But it is also well known that the catalysis of peroxide
of hydrogen, by whatever means it be effected, always takes place
with an evolution of heat, from which it appears that this phae
nomenon is most closely connected with the conversion of O into O.
     Ihold it to be not only possible, but even highly probable,
that in the transformation of the various conditions of oxygen
into each other, the relations of this body to heat become changed.
Or to speak more precisely, that the specific or latent heat of O
is different from, and indeed greater than, that of Q ; from which
it would follow, that in the transformation of Ö into O heat
would be set free.        If we had ozonized oxygen in a pure con
dition, it would be easy to prove the accuracy of this assumption
in the most direct manner. Such an oxygen ought, in                       de                                  its

  Now as heat changes free 0, as well as O combined with
water, into 0, it can also transform the O of the several oxides
of chlorine into O, and, according to my opinion, it can thereby
effect the splitting up of these compounds into chlorine and
common oxygen.       The O of ClO, C10°, C10% undergoes, it is
known, this change of condition so easily, that it is dangerous
to handle these substances; for they decompose with detonation
at temperatures which scarcely reach 100°.
   We know of ClO, that in contact with charcoal powder it
immediately decomposes into Cl and O. The same powder,
according to my experiments, instantaneously transforms free
into O, and is known to change HO-HO rapidly into HO and O.
Now it is probable that charcoal decomposes C10, ClO", ClO4, in
the same manner that it catalyses peroxide of hydrogen, namely,
by changing the O of these compounds.
   That chlorate of potash itself may become catalysed, not only
by heat, but also by a number of ponderable agents, and that
these substances are the same as those which effect the catalysis
of peroxide of hydrogen, or the transformation of free O into O,
are also now well-known facts, and have been already mentioned.

separates iodine from iodide of potassium, changes aqueous sul
phurous acid immediately into sulphuric acid, a solution of yel
low prussiate of potash into red, &c., and NO” is eliminated in
these reactions.
   From these facts it is clear that the two equivalents of oxygen
which are taken up by the deutoxide of nitrogen act in many
cases just like oxygen allotropized by electricity or phosphorus,
on which account we may also assume that hyponitric acid is
nothing else than ozonized deutoxide of nitrogen, or NO”--20.
But if this assumption is admissible, it follows, further, that deut
oxide of nitrogen possesses in a very high degree the property of
Qzonizing oxygen.         And singe NO” not only transforms O into
O, but also unites with this O as such, deutoxide of nitrogen may
be looked upon as the most decided exciter of oxygen (Sauer
stofferreyer) and carrier of 0 (0-träger); and hence it is that it
plays such an important part in certain oxidizing processes;
for example, the conversion of SO? into SO” by means of
atmospheric oxygen.
   The first degrees of oxidation of manganese and iron are
distinguished by the readiness with which they are oxidized by
common oxygen to peroxide of manganese and peroxide of iron.
And of the oxygen united with the protoxide of manganese or of
iron, it is well known that it comports itself in many cases like
the O associated with NO”. Peroxide of manganese even alone
turns tincture of guaiacum blue, and peroxide of iron does so
when it is dissolved in an acid; peroxide of manganese decom
poses solution of indigo just as dissolved peroxide of iron does;
peroxide of manganese oxidizes sulphurous acid; peroxide of
               its                           short, both these oxides com
                          as do

least, into peroxide, which unites with the remainder of the oxide
to form red lead, and the oxidizing actions of the peroxide of lead
show clearly enough that one equivalent of oxygen in this com
pound is in the ozonized condition. We may therefore ascribe
to oxide of lead also the property of transforming, under apprº
priate circumstances, O into O, and of being the carrier of this O.
I have already shown, years ago, that the oxygen ozonized by
electricity or phosphorus combines with PbO to form peroxide
even in the cold.

      SINGULAR
A.                  effect connected with the discharge from
        the conductor of a machine was observed by Gross, and
described under the name of “Electric Pauses,” in the year
1776. The same effect was accidentally observed by Nairne
during his investigations on the best form of lightning conduct
ors, and described in Hutton’s ‘Abridgement of the Philosophical
Transactions” for 1778.     The phaenomenon consists in the dis
appearance and reappearance of the electric spark when the
discharging distance is gradually augmented.      Prof. Riess has
recently repeated these experiments, and describes the following
arrangement made use of by himself as an easy and sure means
of obtaining the effect referred to.
    To the conductor of an electric machine a brass arm was
screwed, and united by a ball-and-socket joint with a brass bar
8 inches long and 2% lines in thickness, which carried at     end      its
a  brass ball   inch
                1       in
                        diameter.    The arrangement     shownis             in
fig. 1.   At  the edge       oftable
                                  a    glass rod was fixed which
                                            a

2,   inches thick could be moved up to contact with the brass
sphere, or withdrawn from it to a distance of 6 inches.      The
collar was connected  by a wire with a general discharging train,
and with the same train the rubber of the machine was also con
nected.  On the end of the brass bar a truncated cone of brass
was screwed, which is shown in section in fig. 2, and the dimen
sions of which were ab 84, be 24, cd 74, and                                               Fig. 2.

machine, the following series of sparks was
obtained by the gradual augmentation of the distance between
the cone and the sphere.

   The continuous passage of sparks took place at the distances
marked S; single sparks occurred at the place marked s; and
where neither of these letters occur no sparks were observed.
Hence in this experiment sparks ; an inch and 2% inches in
length were obtained, but no spark of a length intermediate be

 . The arrangement of the electricity upon the surface of the
sphere,   produced by the approximation of the cone, is to be
regarded as the primary cause of the phaenomenon under consi
deration.    It is known that by the proximity of a conductor
eonnected with the earth, the electric arrangement in an elec
trified body is essentially changed; so that, theoretically con
sidered, a point of an electrified sphere, for example, may, by the
approximation of one unelectrified, be made to assume any den
sity whatever. When the cone connected with the earth is caused
to approach the sphere in the above experiments, the nearest
point of the sphere assumes the greatest electric density, and
from this point           all
                    round the density diminishes upon the sur
                                                                                                         of fix

however, the hand was approached from above to within a distance
of 10 inches, sparks passed incessantly to the lower sphere A;
and, when the hand was removed, again disappeared.                     In the
dark it was observed that by the approximation of the hand
the luminous segment was extinguished upon the pause-sphere.
Here, therefore, by the approximation of a conductor, the arrange
ment on the sphere was changed, by this the streaming out of
the electricity prevented, and the quantity of electricity remain
ing on the conductor augmented.               The electricity of the pause
sphere is not only diminished by the streaming out of the elec
tricity, but also by the circumstance that the brush of the adja
cent pause-cone sends air negatively electrified against                  This      it.

much         shows itself in other experiments which are frequently
              as   it
made.     The absence of the sparks in the interval of the pause
has been ascribed to the circumstance, that the portion of the
spherical surface nearest to the cone, possesses a greater density
than that necessary for the production of a spark. Now the
electricity developed on the conductor has not attained this den
sity instantaneously, but gradually, and there must have been a
point in which the sphere possessed the exact density necessary

270              M. Deville    on the various forms                   of Silicon.
which have been attacked by contact with the sodium, together
with their contents, are exposed in a carbon crucible to the heat
of a wind-furnace. The common salt volatilizes, the porcelain
melts, and globules of silicon presenting remarkable traces of
crystallization are obtained.
    It is also obtained by the action of sodium on a glass free from
iron, and specially prepared for the purpose by melting together
silica, Iceland spar, and carbonate of potash.   This glass, coarsely
powdered, is mixed with sodium and heated to redness in a glass
tube. The black matter which is obtained is heated in a wind
furnace in a carbon crucible placed inside another crucible.
The silicon is found dispersed in the vitreous mass, which is
smoked like obsidian, in the form of small, very brittle, steel
gray globules.
   Silicon may also be extracted from silica by means of the gal
vanic current, by fusing a mixture of fluorides of sodium and
potassium, adding calcined silica, which is very readily dissolved,
and then inserting the platinum and carbon poles of a Bunsen’s
battery of four elements.          Oxygen is disengaged at the negative
pole, and the silicon set free at the platinum pole unites with it
to form a siliciuret of platinum, which fuses with extreme ease.
   Deville obtained simultaneously with, but independently of
Wöhlerº, the graphitoidal form of silicon, but by a different
method.       In preparing aluminium by the battery he obtained
an alloy of aluminium and silicon, which by treatment with acids
yields the graphitoidal form of silicon.             But the best method of
preparing it is that of Wöhler, and Deville confirms the descrip
tion of    itsproperties given              by

heat, and the operation is continued until no more vapours of
chloride of aluminium are formed. The needles of silicon which
are formed are purified from adherent matters by treatment with
aqua regia, hydrofluoric acid, and fusion with bisulphate of soda.
Sometimes         are formed small globules of a siliciuret of
                  there
aluminium which   corresponds  to the formula Si Al”.
   The change in this reaction is thus: the chloride of silicon
is decomposed by the aluminium, which seizes upon the silicon
displaced, from whence a veritable solution results.  Each mole
cule of chloride which is  decomposed,   increases the concentra
tion; and when the saturation of the metallic bath is complete,
the silicon, being lighter, crystallizes on the surface, as does cam-
phor on the surface of an alcoholic solution.
    The crystals of silicon occur sometimes as long needles, some
times as hexagonal prisms culminated by a very acute pyramid
with curved faces, and sometimes in forms resembling a rhombo
hedron, but which are derived from the regular octahedron.
Senarmontº has shown that the regular hexagonal prisms of the
silicon are only faces of the rhomboidal dodecahedron developed
in a very simple manner.
    Silicon has a dark iron-gray colour with a reddish lustre,
and often resembles the specular iron ore of Elba, with                                               all      its
iridescence.    The crystals are perfectly pure; they melt                                                at   a
point intermediate between the fusion          gold and that      castof                             of

chlorine over a mixture of alumina, common salt, and charcoal.
It is volatile and liquefiable, running like water, and becoming
solid when cold. The manufacture of sodium has also been
considerably improved. Its preparation is now as easy as that
of zinc, and             its
                   price ought scarcely      exceed three shillings     to

Mr. Buckton     and   Dr. Hofmann on the Conjugate Sulpho-acids, 277
form of a second short summary, the analytical details and the more
extended description of the new compounds being given in the com
plete memoir, which, at the same time, we have the honour of sub
mitting to the Society.
   Before proceeding, however, to give an account of our new com
pounds, it may be desirable to state that several considerations, sug
gested by the progress of our inquiry, have induced us finally to
adopt the name of Disulphometholic acid instead of the provisional
term Tetrasulphomethylic   acid under which we have described, in
our first communication, the new acid generated by the action of sul
phuric acid upon acetamide and acetonitrile.
                                 ETHYLE-SERIEs.
            Action of Sulphuric Acid upon Propionitrile.
   Considerable difficulty is experienced in preparing this nitrile in a
state of purity.   It was finally obtained by acting upon propion
amide with anhydrous phosphoric acid.
   When three parts by measure of the nitrile are cautiously mixed
with two parts of fuming sulphuric acid, and heat is applied, the
liquids enter into a sort of ebullition, carbonic acid being copiously
evolved; at the same time a portion of propionic acid passes into
the receiver, the amount of which may be lessened by raising the
temperature only gradually.                         -
   At the close of the operation a tenacious mass is found in the
retort, which, when dissolved in water and neutralized with carbonate
of barium, furnishes two rather soluble but readily crystallizable salts,
very difficult to separate one from the other.     Their isolation may
be conveniently effected, by converting them into the corresponding
ammoniacal compounds, by precipitating their solution with car
bonate of ammonium.
   The filtrate yields two substances, one of which crystallizes, while
the other is quite uncrystallizable.
   The latter substance, when long digested with carbonate of barium,
produces crystals of a barium-salt whose analysis gives mumbers lead
ing to the formula
                                C6   (H. Bag) S.    Olo.
  This substance is obviously sulphopropionate of barium, the com
pound next in series to the sulphacetate discovered by M. Melsens.
   It is generally deposited from             its

which arrange themselves      spherical groups. They are very stable,

degrees above this temperature it is decomposed with blackening,
yielding water, sulphurous acid, volatile organic products, and sul
phate of barium.
   We designate this salt as disulphetholate of barium.
   Disulphetholic acid is prepared by precipitating a solution of the
barium-salt with sulphuric acid, the excess of which is again removed
by digestion with oxide of lead, and subsequent treatment with sul
phuretted hydrogen.      It is a crystalline and stable compound, very
acid to the taste, and very deliquescent. With oxide of lead, or
with carbonate of silver, it readily forms the respective salts, both
of which are crystalline.
   After what has been said with reference to the action of sulphuric
acid upon acetamide, it is scarcely necessary to remark that the sul
phopropionates and disulphetholates may be prepared with equal, or
even greater facility from propionamide.      Care, however, should be
taken to use the amide in a perfectly dry state, which prevents in
great measure the formation of free propionic acid.

                 Action     of Sulphuric Acid          upon Butyramide.
   Equal parts by volume of melted butyramide and Nordhausen
sulphuric acid evolve much heat when mixed together.          In the re
action two acids are eliminated, showing that the series bears a strict
analogy with the deportment exhibited by the preceding group.
   As the ammonia-salts of these acids are wholly uncrystallizable,
their separation is almost impossible.    The barium-compounds also
are scarcely to be obtained of a definite form, so that it is a matter
of great difficulty to procure salts of sufficient purity for exact esti
mation.    Recourse was had to fractional precipitation by alcohol.
   The first salt which was deposited formed minute grains, which
adhered strongly to the sides of the glass vessel containing the solu
tion. It gave a percentage of barium which unmistakeably indicated

   The process of converting sulphanilic acid into the disulpho-com
pound is rather tedious.     It may, however, be effected without fail,
by treating for several hours the perfectly dry crystalline acid, mixed
with strong Nordhausen acid, to the consistence of a paste. The
heat should not exceed that at which sulphurous acid just com
mences to be evolved.     We employed an air-bath heated from 160°
to 170°  C., and the  digestion was continued until a portion removed
by a glass rod showed no trace of crystallization when cooled or
moistened with water.
   Treatment with carbonate of barium yielded in this manner a very
soluble salt, which furnished a brittle gum when evaporated. The
new substance was precipitated from          solution       alcohol and   its                      by

      Our experiments point out, moreover, the universal occurrence,
   and the general mode of formation of these substances.           All organic
   molecules, particularly in the nascent state, appear to be capable of
   assimilating the elements of either two or four equivalents of anhy
   drous acid.
      The formation of the two groups of acids which are thus produced
   presents a great analogy with the production of the nitro-substitutes
   generated under the influence of nitric acid.          All these compounds
   are generated with the elimination of water.         In the action of nitric
   and  sulphuric   acid upon benzole,  for  instance,   we have,

     The analogy of these reactions is obvious.
     The action of nitric acid upon organic bodies is by no means
  limited to the production of nitro-compounds corresponding to
  nitrobenzole and dinitrobenzole; frequently additional substitutes are
  formed with elimination of six, eight, and in a few isolated cases,
 even of ten equivalents of water.            It is possible that analogous
 sulpho-compounds may exist.            Hitherto, however, no substances
 have been observed in which the assimilation of sulphuric acid has
 gone further than in the disulpho-acids.

     “On Colour-blindness.”         By William Pole, Esq., F.R.A.S.,
 F.G.S., Memb. Inst. C.E.
     The author's object in this paper is to state his own case of colour
 blindness, which he believes to be one of the most decided on record;
 to compare it with others of the same kind; and to show that the
 general phenomena attending this defect of vision are more uniform
 and consistent, as well as more easy of explanation, than is generally
supposed.
     For general information on the subject, reference is made to a
 work lately published by Dr.Wilson of Edinburgh, entitled “Re
 searches on Colour-Blindness,” in which a great number of cases are
fully described, and the optical and physiological theories of the
defect carefully discussed.
    After stating reasons which justify a colour-blind person under
taking the investigation and description of his own case, the author

                           Mr. W. Pole            on Colour-blindness.                                       283
gives a preliminary statement of his views in regard to the general
theory and momenclature of colours, adopting the ordinary hypo
thesis that red, blue, and yellow are the three primaries; a theory
which, though it has been lately called in question, receives, it is
considered, new support from the phenomena of the defect of vision
under consideration.
   Dr. Wilson describes colour-blindness as of three kinds, namely—
   1.   Inability to discern any colour except black and white.                                              This
    is very rare.
  2. Inability to discriminate between the nicer distinctions of
     colour. This is so common as to be apparently rather the rule
     than the exception.
  3. The third variety is the only one here treated        Its outward                    of.

                                is    distinguish between many
                                                        to         the                                    of
     colours most marked                    to
                              normal eyes, and     most complete form          its

that his vision is perfectly dichromic, and shows the applicability to
it of the definition of this kind of vision given by Sir John Herschel,
 which he believes has never hitherto been followed out so completely
 as is necessary to explain the phenomena observed.
    Blue and yellow he sees perfectly well, and has no reason to doubt
 that his sensations of these two colours are the same as those of the
 normal-eyed. The third primary, red, is the one in regard to which
his vision is defective, but the study of the sensations produced by
this colour has been involved in some difficulty.                    Carmine, the arti
ficial representative of what is usually considered pure red, presents
to the author's eye a very positive sensation, which he long supposed
to be a distinct colour; but on examining it more closely, he found
it to be merely a dark shade of yellow, as he could match carmine
red perfectly with a mixture of yellow and black.                        There       how                                   is,

these. The colour of light, or the hue resulting from their combi
nation, may be called green, white, or grey, at pleasure. It is shown
that this explanation of colour-blind vision will fully account for the
whole of the various symptoms above enumerated. Red and green,
for example, are both seen only as shades of yellow, and if the yellow
is of the same intensity in each, they will appear alike, and of course
be confounded with each other.
    The author then proceeds to consider how far his own case may
be regarded as a type of the defect in general. The varied and in
congruous nature of the symptoms has given rise to a belief that
there are many varieties of colour-blindness, or at least many
different degrees of severity; but after carefully examining the pub
lished accounts, he has arrived at the conviction that the true di
chromic affection is much more common than is generally sup
posed. He points out reasons why the descriptions given by the
colour-blind of their sensations may often be imperfectly expressed
and easily misunderstood, alludes to the difficulty of explaining the
symptoms by any other hypothesis, or even by classifying them in
any consistent way; and considers the fact exemplified in his own
case, that dichromic vision will explain                 the phenomena,          all                                  as
 strongly corroborative         the uniformity
                                           of   insisted on.
    From the results         his investigations, the author draws few in
                                         of                                                                a

time that the red is a    yellow  red, they become quite as distinct to
the colour-blind as to the  normal-eyed.
   The colouring of geological maps is very perplexing to the colour
blind, and it is recommended that engraved marks, to distinguish
the different strata, should always be added to the colours.
   In conclusion, the author gives hints which he considers useful for
the examination of colour-blind persons, and states the importance of
collecting further evidence on the subject, of an accurate and definite
nature.

velocity will, on the contrary, be less than that corresponding with
the atmospheric pressure; and even if the pressure in the most rapid
part falls short of the atmospheric pressure, the density may, on ac
count of the cooling experienced, exceed the atmospheric density.
    We stated that, at 57°Fahr., the greatest velocity of air passing
through a small orifice is 550 feet per second, if reduced to the
density on the high-pressure side.        The experiments from which we
obtained this result enable us also to say that this maximum occurs,
with the above temperature and a barometric pressure of 30:14 inches,
when the pressure of the air is equal to about 50 inches of mercury
above the atmospheric pressure.         At a higher or lower pressure, a
smaller volume of the compressed air escapes in a given time.
    Surface Condenser.—A three-horse power high-pressure steam
engine was procured for our experiments. Wishing to give it equal
power with a lower pressure, we caused the steam from the eduction
port to pass downwards through a perpendicular iron gas-pipe, ten
feet long and an inch and a half in diameter, placed within a larger
pipe through which water was made to ascend.               The lower end of
the gas-pipe was connected with the feed-pump of the boiler, a small
orifice being contrived in the pump cover in order to allow the
escape of air before it could pass, along with the condensed water,
into the boiler.      This simple arrangement constituted a “surface
 condenser” of a     very efficient kind, giving a vacuum of 23 inches,
although considerable leakage of air took place, and the apparatus
generally was not so perfect as subsequent experience would have
enabled us to make           Besides the ordinary well-known advantages

292                           Royal Society.
   In order to estimate the velocity of the currents, one of the ane
mometric discs was placed within a short zinc tube three inches in
diameter, the lower end of which was accurately fitted into an aspi
rator capable of containing thirty-six gallons of water. By drawing
off in a given time a quantity of water equal in bulk to the cubic
contents of one of the tubes described in the former paper, the
velocity of a current required to produce a given number of rotations
of the disc was determined.
   The experiments were varied by altering the height of water in
the aspirator, and thereby changing the velocity, while the exit
orifice remained unaltered.
   By ascertaining the number of rotations of the anemometric disc,
caused by currents of air of different velocities thus produced, he
was enabled to arrive at a measure of the velocities in tubes placed
in a still atmosphere, as described in his former paper.
   The author in that paper pointed out a correspondence between
the variations of force in the upward currents of atmospheric air in
the tubes and variations in the humidity of the atmosphere, and
expressed his belief that the variations were attributable in great
measure to the varying hygrometric conditions of the atmosphere.
    In further proof of this position, he has appended two tables,
showing that both natural and artificial increase of atmospheric
humidity are accompanied by increase in the velocity of the rotations,
and that in each case increase of humidity is attended by increase of
velocity, independent of temperature.

   The object of this paper is to deduce the mathematical theory of
that kind of stability which depends on the mutual friction of the
parts of a granular mass devoid of tenacity, from the known laws of
friction, unaided by any hypothesis.
    The fundamental principle of the internal stability of such a mass
has already been published in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ for De
cember, 1856, viz. that the ratio of the difference to the sum of the
greatest and least pressures at each point of the mass must not
exceed the sine of the angle of repose.
    The principles of the general theory of the internal equilibrium of
a solid mass are expressed in a form suited to the special subject of
the paper.     For the purpose of determining the conditions of equi
                   its
                                   of of

generating line, the mass   by   supposed       to   divided into layers

equal horizontal thrust     a isseries     of
                                            surfaces, which layers are sub
divided into   elementary  horizontal    prisms       by
                                                      vertical planes normal
to   the vertical plane first mentioned.         For independent variables
there are taken the horizontal coordinate        inthis plane, and the total
horizontal thrust from the    upper    surface down        togiven surface

 equal thrust.     The condition of equilibrium of any one of the be
 fore-mentioned elementary prisms being expressed by a differential
 equation in terms of those variables, the integration of that equation
 gives the vertical coordinate of any surface of equal thrust in terms
 of the total thrust down to that surface and of the horizontal co
 ordinate.    The integral obtained belongs to a class first investigated
 by Fourier.
    An approximation to the forms of the surfaces of equal thrust
is obtained by a simple graphic process, first employed by Prof.
William Thomson in connexion with the theory of electricity.
    It is shown incidentally how the same integral may be applied to
determine the intrados from the extrados of any arched rib, loaded
only with        its
                own weight.

     1.    San Fernando Copper Lode, Cuba.-The district    which these                  in
lodes are found consists    granites and syenites, passing into por
                                       of
phyritic rocks, and partly covered with calcareous conglomerate
and limestone.   The granites are affected      systems              by
                                                          joints which                  of
heave each other, and                by
                         veins offelspar occasionally containing sil
ver. The mineral fields occur      calcareous porphyries passing into
                                                    in
true porphyries, and into conglomerates.       The upper lodes, which
                                                                    .

  the lodes reaching 50 feet, and the width of the mineral field half
  a mile.     The underlie is small. The principal lode (the northern)
  has been opened on by eight pits, whence have been taken, from a
  depth nowhere exceeding 32 fathoms, upwards of 10,000 tons of
  rich copper-ore.      Ore was seen at the bottom at one shaft, the lode
  being 35 feet wide, including about 5 feet of barren ground and some
  underlie on the foot wall.
      2. Sykesville Copper Lodes near Baltimore, U.S.—The country here
  consists of metamorphic rock ranging N.N.E. and S.S.W., and
  dipping E.S.E. at a high angle. There are in the lodes granites,
  gneiss, and mica-slate, with magnesian rocks. The lodes are nearly
  vertical, ranging parallel to the “country”, but dipping in the oppo
  site direction.    The veins at the top contain much magnetic oxide of
  iron, but below ten fathoms this changes to pyrites, succeeded and
  accompanied by copper pyrites. The lode did not appear settled at the
  depth reached by the existing shafts. There were several points at
  which pits had been sunk and some copper ore obtained: in all of
 them the gossan had a tendency to pass into magnetic iron-ore.             A
  remarkable and very large group of lodes was observed at the “Point
 of Rocks,” where the outcrop is hydrated oxide of iron, worked as an
 iron-ore to some extent.
     3. Ducktown Copper Lodes in East Tennessee, U.S.–In the south
 eastern corner of Tennessee, near North Carolina and Georgia, are a
 number of lodes, strongly indicated by a rich gossan, and yielding a
 peculiar and rich black ore which has attracted much attention from
 American geologists.        The “country” consists of altered Silurian
  schists, alternating with grits;               all
                                         striking parallel      the mountain          to
 range (N. 30°E.,       S.30° W.), and dipping S.E.         high angle. Theat     a
 talcose schists pass into garnet schists and become steatitic.         They
 are accompanied         bynumerous strings     quartz, not true veins, the
                                                            of
 width   of                                              18 feet, and which
                                                                          or or

These also dip S.E. The enclosing rocks are talcose and steatitic,
and contain cyanite, epidote, and garnets.
     The length    of the gossan lodes varies from 600 yards         upwards                to

varies from a few inches to 18 feet; but, where tolerably uniform, the
 average is 4 or 5 feet. Rich bunches of ore are found occasionally.
    The ore, as assayed by Mr. Henry, consists of sulphur, 29:47;
 copper, 26-73; iron, 26.04; quartz, 8:6; oxygen and loss, 9:16.
    The yield, on an average of six samples taken carefully from heaps
 of ore from different mines, is 26.2 per cent. of copper.
    Of the four lodes, the Hiwassee ranges N.E. and S.W., dipping
 S.E. about 15 inches in a fathom. The gossan has been traced for
 a mile and a half, the width averaging 30 feet, and the thickness of
black ore 3 feet. It is continued by strings of quartz towards the
 S.W., and also by a kind of contra-lode, which ultimately becomes the
Tennessee lode. This latter is irregular and bunchy, but has yielded
large quantities of rich black ore and some red oxide.                   It has been
traced as a gossan-lode for about three quarters of a mile, ranging
N. 20° E. and S. 20° W.
    The Polk-County lode is nearly parallel with the Tennessee lode, and
of about the same length, as determined by                   outcrop.              its

been inferred from this, that in the friction of two dissimilar bodies,
that which disengages the most heat generally has a negative tend

duction of heat and that of electricity, which I have always regarded
as concomitant, and which may be of such a nature that one becomes
annulled by the increase of the other. There would therefore be

          NOTE ON THE DENSITY AND THE MASS OF COMETS.
                        BY M. BABINET.
  All  astronomers are agreed that the mass and density       comets                               of
are very small, and that their attraction cannot produce any sensible
effect upon the movements        the planetary bodies. We shall see
                                                  of
that from the effects observed, combined with the laws     optics, we                         of
may deduce the conclusion that the direct shock         one     these                    of            of

bodies could not cause the penetration of the infinitely rarefied matter
of which they are composed, even into our atmosphere.
    It is a well-ascertained fact that stars of the tenth and eleventh
magnitude, and even lower ones, have been seen through the central
part of comets, without any sensible loss of brilliancy.             Amongst the
observers who have         frequently   proved   this   optical  fact,  we find the
names of Herschel, Piazzi, Bessel, and Struve.                In most cases, says
Mr. Hind, there is not the least perceptible diminution in the bril
liancy of the star. As to the pretended phases of the cometary
nuclei, the direction of the line of the horns was incompatible with
the hypothesis of the illumination of an opake nucleus, and the
modern representations of the appearance of comets readily explain
the error of those who have assumed opake nuclei.                   I shall take as
an example the well-known comet of Encke, which is sometimes
visible to the naked eye, and generally presents a rounded mass.
In 1828 it formed a regular globe of about 500,000 kilometres in
diameter, with no distinct nucleus; and M. Struve saw a star of the
eleventh magnitude through                           its
                                           central part, without noticing any
diminution       brilliancy.

magnitude.
      e  may assume that the lightof the moon causes the disappearance
 of  all the stars below the fourth magnitude; thus the atmosphere
 illuminated       by
                  the full moon acquires sufficient luminosity  render                             to
 stars  ofthe fifth, and              all
                            lower magnitudes invisible.
    Between the fifth magnitude and the eleventh, there are six orders
 of magnitude, and according                         to
                                    the fractional relations     these dif                    of

                                               is                    a
 than the latter.           In

 we may see       good compilation
                   a                     that excellent astronomer, Mr.

Johnson, upon this subject, and very recently         a work by Mr. Pogson
on the valuations of magnitudes has appeared. From this we learn
that a star of the fifth magnitude is about two hundred and fifty
times more brilliant than a star of the eleventh magnitude.               Thus
the illumination of the atmosphere by the moon is much more intense
than the illumination of the cometary substance by the sun itself,
since it would be necessary to render the comet three thousand six
hundred times more luminous to enable it to extinguish a star of the
eleventh magnitude, whilst the luminosity of the atmosphere illumi
nated only by the moon is sufficient to render invisible stars which
are two hundred and fifty times more brilliant.
   The disproportion becomes still more striking when we consider,
that, according to the measurements of Wollaston, to which Sir John
Herschel says he sees no objections to be made, the illumination of
the full moon is a little less than the eight hundred thousandth part
 of the full illumination of the sun.
    To complete the data of our definite calculation, we shall call
to mind, that, according to the density of the air in the lower strata
of the atmosphere and its total weight as indicated by the barometric
column, the whole stratum of air which constitutes the atmosphere
is equivalent to a stratum of about 8 kilometres in thickness, and
possessing the density of the air at the surface of the earth.
    We have alseady found that it would be necessary to render the
comet 3600 times more luminous for it to extinguish the lustre of a
 star of the eleventh magnitude. To render a star of the fifth magni
tude invisible, it would require to be made 3600 x 250 times more bril
liant than it     is.   In
                         other words,     the atmosphere were 3600 250
                                                  if                                                       x

          have to be overcome in order to calculate the attraction
of a  given   body upon a given material point according to New
ton's law of the inverse square of the distance, nothing is more
evident than that innumerable other bodies exist, differing from
each other in shape as well as situation in space, each of which
would attract the given point in precisely the same manner as
the given body. Taken in                  its

                     On equally attracting Curves.
   To determine any point in space, we shall employ polar coor
dinates, the attracted point being always considered as the pole;
and when a system of curves are referred to this point as pole,
we shall, for the sake of brevity, call     points    such curves   all                of
situated  upon   the same radius vector corresponding points; the
arcs       of
        these curves intercepted between the same two vectors we
shall term corresponding arcs     elements, according
                                                   or    the same                           as
are       of
       finite        or
                infinitesimal length;  and corresponding elements
produced indefinitely, corresponding tangents. This being                                                    un
derstood, the problem with which alone we shall            present                            at
occupy ourselves may                     be
                           thus enunciated:      find    the curves            To           all
whose elements attract the pole     the same manner    in                                   as    the   corre
sponding elements               of
                       given curve.  a
     At first       let   the given attracting curve        the plane     be   in                       of   the
attracted point,               so

Hence we may conclude generally, if an ellipse and hyperbola
have a focus and vertea in common, and if the principal avis of the
one be equal to the                   focal distance of the other, then the                                       common

of p and r2 the one will increase whilst the other decreases, and
vice versd; so that whilst the one curve through m, like the given
curve, is concave towards the pole, the other will be convex. As
the point m recedes to a greater distance, the curves passing
through the same cut the radius vector more and more acutely,
until ultimately they both coincide with it in direction. The
asymptotes of the two curves passing through the infinitely di
stant point of the line OM are of course the two tangents of the
circle Pu which are parallel to OM. Had the point m been
situated between p and the pole, then as it would have been im
possible to draw tangents from it to the circle Pu, the curves
could not have been constructed.          In fact the equation (14)
necessitates the inequality u <U+2192> 0 or r >p.        Had m coincided
with the  point  u, the two curves could  only have been constructed
on one side of the radius vector, to which they would have been
perpendicular. In short, generally, two equally attracting curves
terminate abruptly in every such point A, and are there at right
angles to the radius vector.     The locus of the point p, which we
shall call the limiting curve, is represented by the equation
                              r=p=                 .   .  .  .   (15)

In  general, therefore, we may conclude that through every point
m of the angular space M10 M2, except those within the space
bounded by the limiting curve (15), pass two, and only two, curves
whose elements attract the pole in the same manner as the cor
responding elements of the given curve.        Every two such curves
are  equally inclined to their common radius vector; and as far as
convexity or concavity towards the pole is concerned, the curva
ture of the one is similar, of the other dissimilar, to that at corre
sponding points of the given curve.         Thus the whole series of
                                  º
curves which fill the angular space M, O M2, with the exception
of that portion of it bounded by the limiting curve into which
none of them enter, may be considered as composed of two
groups, the individuals of which are distinguished from each
other by the nature of their curvature towards the pole, and are
represented by the particular integrals of the equations

    Besides the curves contained in these two groups, there are
innumerable others, both continuous and discontinuous, whose
elements attract the pole in the required manner. All such,

 by the delay in the publication of his work.      Dr. Noad having
 considered these remarks to   imply   an accusation of plagiarism,
 I take this opportunity of stating that                       I
                                             did not intend them to
 convey any such imputation, and that                      I
                                           only wished to complain
 that Dr. Noad had done me an injustice and a serious commer
 cial injury by suppressing my invention, and giving publicity
 and precedence to another production of more recent date, and
 almost identical with my own.
                                                  I
    During the past nine months have had opportunities of still
 further extending the principle upon which my machine is con
 structed, and with a corresponding increase of power; since                                    I
 have occasionally, from a single machine, produced sparks
                                                       I
 4 inches in length in free air, and have very little doubt that
 I could construct machines to give sparks of 12 inches or more.
    The results obtained by this increase of power are very striking,
 and phaenomena previously unknown are continually developing
 themselves.           I
                  have before alluded to two different classes of
 thermal effects obtained: first, from the simple spark between
 the terminals; and secondly, from the spark produced through
 the intervention of the Leyden jar. The simple spark passing
 between    the terminals is comparatively soft and attenuated,
 though when of considerable length it is accompanied by a
 tolerably sharp snap.       Sparks of 2 to 3 inches in length are
 extremely crooked, the deflections sometimes increasing the
 length of the spark to nearly one-half more than the distance
 between the terminals.        Imperfect conductors, such as paper or
 wood, assist the spark in overleaping the interval; for if the
 points be placed beyond the striking distance, and a sheet of
 paper be held parallel to them and nearly an inch distant from
 each, sparks will frequently pass from one point to the paper
 and across        its
                   surface      the other point.
                                     to                   this way      In

 often obtained sparks nearly          inches
                                            6     length.  in
    The chief characteristic         this spark
                                           of           power  is  igniting
                                                                    its              of
 or burning substances which are either non-conductors                  bad               or
 conductors; and some           these effects are very remarkable.
                                     of
    On one occasion, when experimenting with one                  my large          of
 coils, two wires from the terminals were accidentally lying with
 their ends                       several inches from each other upon
                                      of
                  at
                  a distance

                  I                   to
                                 set the machine      action, and instantly
                                                                   in
                                                                    on on
 the table burst into flame         the two spots
                                           in           which the ends                          of
 the wires   rested,  and the combustion went           rapidly increasing
 until stopped the machine.
       I                                Noticing this, took        pieceI            a          of
 deal and   slightly  moistened             its
                                       surface with nitric acid and placed
       on
        the table      the universal discharger, with the points about
                           of
4 it
   inches apart.       On connecting         with the machine, the com
                                                  it
 bustion commenced           the points
                                at             before, and the flames ad

                  a rapid succession         of Electrical              Discharges.                         327
vanced along the surface of the wood towards each other, and in
the course of a minute or two united near the middle, forming
a long crooked line of fire between the points.   This effect took
place most rapidly when the points were placed on the longitu
dinal section of the wood of the same year's growth; for if placed
indiscriminately on different portions of the wood, the sparks
would advance from each point a certain distance, following the
course  of the grain, and then suddenly jump over into the next
layer, and so on at irregular intervals until they both reached
the same longitudinal layer, when they would rapidly advance
towards each other, and the combustion would instantly increase
throughout the whole of the crooked circuit thus produced.
    On connecting with the wires of the universal discharger the
ends of a slip of deal about as thick as a goose-quill, and 5 or 6
inches long, slightly moistened with nitric acid, it instantly takes
                                                                                         is it its
fire at the points of contact, and the sparks pass along                surface,

                                                  length,    when      assumes

consumed.      Sometimes the spark, instead              passing over    of
face and kindling           it,
                         will rise from one portion and leap                 the
middle       or
             some other   spot,   where      instantly  it burns   through   the
wood and generally breaks                    it.
    This remarkable action         not confined
                                            is          inflammable imperto

an almost corresponding increase of these effects, the mind is
naturally led to inquire whence this additional power is derived,
and whether any of the correlative physical forces operating to
produce it have undergone any material change in their cha
racter. Here is an abundant field for inquiry, and the practical
determination of the nature of these mutations may serve to                                             in
dicate the cytent to which the electrical developments resulting
from a given amount of inducing magnetic action may be carried.
So far as I have gone, they appear to be pretty nearly coincident
with the lengths of secondary wire employed, though certain
considerations would lead to the inference that the external
layers of the secondary wire would be less effective than the                                           in
ternal ones.   One effect is worthy of remark in passing: it is
the apparent absorption of the magnetic intensity of the core
under certain conditions of the induced current, as is evidenced
                                                                               ...                      in
by the action of the vibrating spring, whose energy is much
fluenced by alterations in the character of the secondary circuit,
and whose vibrations become occasionally much               when
the circuit is quite closed.
   The thermal effect, then, of the current upon an external cir
cuit will depend upon the quantity of electricity transmitted in
each wave, and the electrical capacity of the terminal or trans
mitting conductors, up to the point at which they are full
capable of containing                  all
                           the electricity sent forward         them.                    to             If

  impulses of great power, such as the discharge of the electrical
 battery, &c., it appears much better adapted for the examination
 of the effects of continuous voltaic currents, or of rapidly recur
 ring Leyden discharges of small amount%.
     When a single electrical discharge is passed through the wire
 of the instrument, an effect is produced varying in a known de
 finite relation to the quantity of electricity transmitted. This
 appears to be as the square of the quantity; but the effect pro
 duced is a transient one, and subsides instantly after the passage
 of the discharge, and even before              registration     its
                                                                 completed                  is                     on

              a rapid          succession        of Electrical Discharges.                                     333

practicable,       I
               had recourse to another expedient.      first ascer                           I
tained the effect   produced   upon  the thermo-electrometer    by
single discharges of the coil, from a jar containing a square foot
                           I
of surface, and found these to be about 1 degree on the scale
for each discharge; and if the discharges were made to follow
each other in succession as rapidly as would admit of their being
              I
counted, found that up to a certain point the degrees indicated
were nearly as the number of discharges.
    My next step was to ascertain if the same amount of charge
in the jar from the electrical machine would produce the same
effect; and having found this to be the case, I mounted the jar
with a Lane's discharger, the balls of which were adjusted so as
to produce a discharge of the requisite strength, a thermo-elec
trometer being made to complete the circuit.       As no electrical
 machine would charge a jar with sufficient rapidity,       thought                                   I
 of accumulating a powerful charge in a large battery, and of
 drawing off the electricity rapidly from this reservoir into the jar
 by means of a point, and succeeded admirably as far as the limits
 of the charge would allow.                          I
                                  arranged on a table a battery of
thirty square feet of surface, and connected it with the electrical
machine, and upon a separate table placed the square-foot jar
with    its
          discharger and thermo-electrometer,  but without any
                                      outer coating and that  its

London   I  was desirous     obtaining the equivalent

   accomplish this. The machine having been powerfully ex

386       On a new Instrument for Registering Electrical Discharges.
operation, I connected with the conductor a jar containing a
square foot of surface, in communication with which were a
Lane's discharger, the spark-counter, and a thermo-electrometer.
The discharging interval was adjusted so that each discharge
produced   one degree of effect upon the thermo-electrometer.
This interval was rather more than 0-2 of an inch, and the dis
charges passed at the rate of seven per second.  The discharger
was fitted with balls of               l
                          inch diameter, and the bottom of the
jar was connected with the gas-fittings.       The total rise of the
thermo-electrometer was 20 degrees.
    On comparing these effects with those of the coil, it would
appear that since the latter is capable of producing from 100 to
 150 discharges per second, or even more, each raising the fluid
 1 degree of the thermo-electrometer,      it would be equivalent to
fifteen or  twenty such   hydro-electric  machines.     I next discon
nected the jar and caused a current of dense sparks of 2 inches
in length to pass from the conductor through the spark-counter
and thermo-electrometer, the latter being in connexion with the
gas-fittings, and with this arrangement obtained sparks at the I
rate of thirteen per second, producing a rise in the thermometer
of only 5 degrees. I had the curiosity to receive a few of these
sparks on my hand; they were extremely violent, and were felt
very powerfully in the legs and heels, although the floor was
wood.     They were not, however, so painful as static sparks from
the outer terminal of the coil.
    The quantity of electricity developed by this hydro-electric
machine must have been very great, since on attempting to re
duce the rapidity of the discharges of the jar by placing an im
perfect conductor in contact with the machine, I found that my
oak walking-stick produced scarcely any effect when laid upon
the conductor, until the portion between the conductor and my
hand was reduced to 3 or 4 inches.
    The quantity of static electricity developed by the coil appears
by these comparisons to be very great, but         effects are      its
                                                                   very                  of

peculiar kind. One cannot help being struck with the difference
between the character of the current which excites the machine
and that developed               by   it.
                              The former possesses         tension, but         no

      may be seen without difficulty, that if X, u' be the values
     It
for a polygon of n—l sides, and X", p" those for a polygon of n
sides, then the values for a polygon of n+1 sides are

And since in the case of the triangle we have N=a, u'=A'8,                                                               *
and in the case of the quadrilateral we have X"=8”, p"=ay,
where  y=4Aa-H280, we can form, step by step, the equation
for any polygon.
   From these we can deduce the condition that it should be
possible to describe a polygon inscribed in                                         V,      and circumscribed
about U. These conditions are,

proportion of the three constituents would remove the anomaly;
or the very hygroscopic nature of the dried substance would of
itself be quite sufficient to account for such an excess of water;
for  I  found that when, after drying, it was left for a day or two,
even in clamped watch-glasses in a balance-case, it had regained
half the weight which it had lost by drying. I may also state
here, that, on the authority of Brande, the neutral hydrate
of alumina sustains a temperature                                of 100° C. without    -      loss of

    If the formulae  obtained by these analyses may be considered
as  expressing  the real constitution of this mineral, it would appear
that it consists of a mixture of neutral silicate of alumina with a
variable amount of neutral hydrate; the former mineral is not,
I  believe, known in an isolated state, but the latter as Gibbsite
frequently occurs: were we acquainted with the former also, we
might imagine allophane to be the transition, or a series of trans
ition stages between it and Gibbsite; this is well shown by the
collected formulae:—

      is scarcely conceivable that this very great loss of water
should be peculiar to the Charlton allophane; but it yet seems
singular that no chemist but Guillemin should have made the
observation that such a loss occurred, and that in his case it
should have been comparatively so small : obviously in these
specimens, at least, the water in the native mineral exists in
two very different states of combination; whether the entire

interchange we have

  13.      I premise the             following known results of the theory of
substitutions:—
  I.     The repetition of an interchange restores the function to
its   original state. Consequently
                             y(*)(*)=x(*)-y
  II.  Let A1, A2 and Aa denote any three forms  states which                       or
the elements are capable   assuming from changes
                                           of        arrange                              of

The substitutions               on   the left are called contiguous.

              back      the  original
                              to        function. This number (the
degree      the substitution) cannot exceed the number     elements                       of
or  suffixes contained               in
                            the affix when reduced      most simple            to   its

by                   the (n-1)th degree followed                                          by
                                                                                               be an
     a   substitution           of                       inter

sented by,    most,   at             n–l
                           interchanges. This     demonstrated                 is
by the introduction    contiguous  of
                                   substitutions. For example,

are taken.             Thus
                            y()()=x()(?).

              y(?)(#)-x(t)(#)-x(t)(*).
   VII. We can operate with the first and second of any three
interchanges as if the third did not exist, and in operating with
the second and third we may neglect the first.

360             Mr.    J.   Cockle on the Theory of Equations
And, importing into these results the relations of VI. (art. 13),
we find that, of the thirty binary interchanges which can be ap
plied to 6, twenty-four are reducible to single interchanges.
   18. Of the remaining six binary interchanges four are                                       simi
larly reducible. For from 0=6l we obtain
               9()(?)-6("),                               ()(*!)-6(*).
and the interchanges on the left, being independent, may be
transposed.
   19. Lastly, lº does not affect 6.
   20. Hence the binary, and of course the higher, interchanges
produce no other effect on 6 than the single ones; so that by
single interchanges we can evolve      the values     which all                    of            6
                                                                                                 is
susceptible.
      21. Those values are six only, viz.
          o,     (), (), (), (),                                                    (...)

                                               o() =0(...).
      22. Consequently           6   depends    upon    equation  an  the sixth     of
degree, the coefficients             of   which are symmetric functions                     of   a,   b,
c   and   d.

 364         On the Theory     of Equations of the Fifth  Degree.
    A. There is a criterion of solvability of    a quintic which can be
 put under the form
                  Fº<U+017F>)—ºr,0<U+017F>)(4)(4)(4)=0.
    B. The pair of equations
                  Fºº-0. Fº<U+017F>)(4)()(?)=0
 conducts us to De Moivre's form, i.       e. to
                  Ba–0,       B1–3 B,”=0.
     C. Either of the pairs
                F(<U+017F>)=0,          F(<U+017F>)(4)(4)(A)=0.
 Or
                F.(<U+017F>)=0, Fº<U+017F>)(4)(4)(3)=0
 leads to Euler's form, i.    e. to
                B2–0,     5B,”—5°B,”--5°B.,B.B. =0.
    D. The general     equation   of A leads to a resultant in which P
 enters to twenty-four dimensions.
    E. The functions Fa satisfying the equation
                     Fe(<U+017F>)=Fº<U+017F>)(#)
 the general relation of   A   takes the form
                     Fe(<U+017F>)—ºr,0<U+017F>)(4)(3)
 Consequently, the interchanges being independent, the factors
of the general resultant occur in pairs, which we may represent by
          Fa—i'F's,      Fa-i"Fe,      or F-8G,      G-#"F.
    F., The decomposition of the general resultant of the twenty
fourth degree into biquadratic factors depends upon an equation
of the sixth degree.
    33. Judging from the analogies afforded by Mr. Jerrard’s
discussion of De Moivre's form, we shall, prior to inquiring into
the possibility of solving this equation of the sixth degree, have
to take into consideration the forms of the functions denoted by
t, u and v. Into this somewhat laborious and complicated           in
quiry   I am not at present prepared to enter, and it may well
form the subject of a separate investigation.

    The insoluble matter appeared to be nothing more than Wen
lock shale entangled in the limestone.
    As this limestone is very largely employed in Staffordshire in
the blast-furnaces for smelting iron, the amount of phosphoric
acid here present is most important in a metallurgical point of
view, and of course highly injurious to the quality of the iron
produced.
    2. Lower Silurian.—Bala limestone”, Ysputty Evan, North
Wales.
    The specimen analysed did not contain any fossils, and was
extremely impure; it could hardly be termed a true limestone,
being rather a shale interlaminated with irregular depositions of
calcareous matter, crystalline in texture.        On dissolving in acids,
the insoluble residue was      argillaceous,  as  might  be expected.
    50.18 grs. gave 26-23 insoluble, and 0.37 organic matter;
2.43 sesquioxide of iron and alumina with phosphoric acid;
0.12 phosphate of magnesia from phosphoric acid determination,
and 1:34 from the magnesia present; and the mean of two de                i
terminations gave 1984 carbonate of lime. 48.31 grs., heated
to  300°F., lost 0:26     estimated as water.
    The analysis when tabulated stands as follows:—

   3. Lower Silurian.—Bala limestone, Rhiwlas, Wales. The
specimen was fossiliferous and very impure, being more strictly
an indurated marl than a limestone.           The carbonate of lime
present appeared to be disseminated through the mass as crystal
line particles.
   The residue, after dissolving in acids, appeared to be a clay.
The specific gravity was found to be 2.78 at 60°F.
   28:84 grs. were examined, and yielded 5'66 grs. carbonic acid
as loss; 21:08 insoluble, and 0.94 organic matter; 0.39 sesqui
oxide of iron and alumina with phosphoric acid; 0.06 phosphate
of magnesia from phosphoric acid determination, and 0.53 gr.

   5.  Cambrian.—Limestone from Church Stretton, Longmynd.
   In a cursory examination of this district last winter, I found
a thin bed of limestone probably from 4 to 6 inches in thickness,
rather irregular, and occurring imbedded in the brownish-gray
clay-slates immediately in the village of Church Stretton. Owing
to the weather and untoward circumstances it was but very su
perficially examined.
   This limestone is not marked upon the Ordnance Geological
Survey Sections of this district (Nos. 34 and 36), nor on the
Map (61 S.W.), and, as far as I am aware, has not previously
been noticed.     It is of a bluish-gray colour, compact, and slightly
crystalline; in parts it is often very pure, frequently much more
so than the specimen analysed.
   This limestone must probably be at present considered as the
lowest known limestone whose geological position can be cor
rectly determined; and by comparison with the Ordnance Geo
logical Survey Section (No. 36), it must be situated more than
23,000 feet below the base of the Llandeilo or Bala beds.             No
traces of fossils were observed; but when dissolved in acids, the
piece analysed left a siliceous cast, very similar to what might be
expected when dissolving a coralline limestone where the inter
stices of the coral had subsequently     -   been filled up by siliceous
matter.
    The specific gravity was found to be 2.33 at 60°F. The quan
tity operated upon was 23-61 grs., which afforded 6:37 insoluble
skeleton, 0.08 organic matter, 2.14 sesquioxide of iron and alu
mina with phosphoric acid, 0.20 phosphate of magnesia from
estimating the phosphoric acid, and 0-39 ditto from the magnesia
present; also 1490 carbonate of lime.
   The analysis when tabulated will stand as follows:—
            Carbonate of lime      .   .   .   .  .   63:10

               the Silurian and Cambrian     Limestones,           '869
    6. Cambrian.-Limestone from Craigmuir near Inverary.
Metamorphic and not fossiliferous; specimen from a series of
alternating beds of from 6 inches to several feet thickness of
 limestone with clay-shales, and resting upon clay-slates.        They
have an E. and W.    strike, with dip of 30° to N., and are continuous
for many miles.
    This limestone is beautifully foliated by plates of silvery mica,
which separates in large quantities when the limestone is dis
solved in acids.    The foliation appears to be perfectly parallel to
the plane of bedding of the rocks.
    The limestone is compact, but not hard, and is of a grayish
colour, splitting easily along the planes of foliation, and the sur
faces thus exposed being covered by a beautiful white mica.
    The specific gravity was found to be 2.72 at 60°F. 29-22
grs. were analysed and yielded 9:41 carbonic acid, 7-08 insoluble,
residue chiefly mica, 0.06 organic matter, 0.47 sesquioxide of iron
and alumina,020 gr, phosphate of magnesia from the phosphoric
acid, and 0.05 ditto from the magnesia determination.
    These results afford the following per-centage composition:—

    7. White limestone forming veins and irregular masses in the
hornblende schist at Kragerod, Norway, and having a peculiar
shell-like laminar structure.
    The hornblende schist in which this limestone occurs contains
numerous veins of phosphate of lime; and this limestone was
analysed under the supposition, that, as it had apparently been
formed by the deposition from water filtering through the sur
rounding strata, it would contain a large amount of phosphoric
acid, which, however, was not found to be the case. The specific
gravity was found to be 2.69 at 60°F.
    On analysis, 46.94 grs. yielded 4:24 insoluble, 0.36 organic
matter, 0.13 alumina, with phosphoric acid and trace of iron,
41-89 carbonate of lime, 0.07 oxide of manganese, and 0.16 gr.
phosphate of magnesia from the phosphoric acid determination.
    54.73 grs. examined for magnesia afforded 0-14 gr. phosphate
of magnesia, and 50.17 grs, dried at 300°F., yielded 0-11
water as loss.

   In comparing     the above limestones, in respect to their che
mical  composition,   with those of the later formations, there seems
to be but little difference, if we except that the older limestones
are generally more impure and, considered as rock masses, seldom
contain so large an amount of carbonate of lime as the limestones
of the later formations.
   With regard to their respective amounts of phosphoric acid,
the now fossiliferous limestones from Church Stretton and Inve
rary, as well as the Llandeilo limestone, contain fully as much
phosphoric acid as the subsequent limestones; and if we take
into consideration the respective amounts of carbonate of lime,
the same may be said of the Bala limestones.
   That the phosphoric acid present in these limestones has been
derived from organic remains seems the more probable, from our
not finding phosphoric acid in those varieties of carbonate of lime
crystallized from solution; and amongst           the numerous ana        all

    Under the impression that the occurrence of magnesia in
limestones first commenced during the Devonian period, Kjerulf
has recently made use of this view as a means for determining
the position of stata, which, not being fossiliferous, do not afford
palaeontological  evidence of their geological position.        The
desirability of such a means of classification is obvious, but                                                  its
correctness must               be
                      questioned.
    The analyses here brought forward certainly show but very
little magnesia; but have found that two limestones imbedded

These acid-forming radicals contain, in addition to carbon and hy
 drogen, oxygen and other elements belonging to the oxygen group.
They are closely connected with the radicals of the alcohols, and
this close connexion is particularly well established between the first
series of alcohol-forming radicals and the corresponding series of acid
forming radicals.

   Formic, acetic and propionic acids are formed by the imperfect
oxidation of methyle-, ethyle- and propyle-alcohol, and we may con
sider them to be simple substitution-products of these alcohols.
   By means of the electric current we are able to produce ethyle,
 methyle and hydrogen from propionic, acetic and formic acids, and
these acids we may reproduce again by the action of hydrate of
potassa on the cyanogen compounds of hydrogen, methyle and
ethvle.
   Hi, series of radicals     are chained together by these reactions, and
we   may    view  acetyle  and propionyle as formyle, the hydrogen        of-
                                                                 -

   There is no doubt that the same relation exists between the hydro
 carbons of the other series of radicals and the radicals of the corre
sponding acids, between allyle, C5H, and the radical of acrylic acid,
acryle C, H, O, and between methylene, C,           H, ethylene, C, H, pro
pylene, &c., and the radicals of the bibasic acids, which are homo
logues of succinic acid, C, H, Os.
   The biatomic radicals are in general far less studied than the
monatomic radicals; still they occur in many compounds, and are
met with in different departments of chemistry.
   In addition to the terms already mentioned, we find them in the
phenyle, benzyle, naphthyle and other series.
   In the hope of adding some facts to the history of the polyatomic
radicals,   I  have made some experiments with chloride of ethylene,
C, H, Cla.
   This compound, as well as the bromide of ethylene, refused to act
in many instances; in others it underwent the same change which is
induced by the action on it of a solution of potassa in alcohol, split
ting into the compound C, H, Cl and hydrochloric acid.

lution of sulphocyanide of potassium, a very definite reaction takes
place. The change being completed, the alcohol is separated by
distillation, and the residue treated with a small quantity of cold
water in order to remove chloride or bromide of potassium, which is
produced, and the excess of sulphocyanide of potassium.            The more
or less coloured residue is then dissolved in boiling alcohol, and the

The acid produced by the action of nitric acid upon sulphocyanide
of ethylene obviously belongs to the same type. In this compound,
which in the conception of this view may be called ethylene-sulphurous
acid, the cyanogen is replaced by hydrogen, whilst the sulphur has
been oxidized into the compound radical S, Oc, which in
acid we assume united with hydrogen.

  The crystals of dinitroethylate     of zinc and zincethyle instantly
become   opake on exposure to the air, owing to the formation of an
oxidized product.     They are tolerably soluble in anhydrous ether
without decomposition, but are instantly decomposed by anhydrous
alcohol and by water.      Exposed to the gradually increasing heat of
an oil-bath, dinitroethylate of zinc and zincethyle fuses at 100° Cent.,
froths up, and begins slowly to evolve gas. At 180° the colour
darkens, a small quantity of a highly alkaline liquid distils over, and
a large amount of gas is evolved.       The latter consists of carbonic
acid, olefiant gas, hydride of ethyle, nitrogen and protoxide of mi
trogen.    When brought into contact with water, dinitroethylate of
zinc and zincethyle is immediately decomposed with lively efferves
cence, due to the evolution of pure hydride of ethyle.    An opalescent
solution is formed, possessing a powerfully alkaline reaction and a
peculiar bitter taste.    The opalescent solution contains only basic
dinitroethylate of zinc, and the reaction is expressed by the following
equation:-
      N, C, H, O, Zn-i-C4H, Znl
                           HO         }

                                                <U+017F> C, H, H
  Carbonic acid decomposes      this basic salt, precipitating carbonate
of zinc, and leaving the neutral salt in solution.
   Dinitroethylate of zinc and zincethyle is also decomposed by dry
oxygen according to the following equation:—
           N, C, H, O, Zn-FC, H, Znl                 <U+017F> N, CAH, O, Zn
                                          a   <U+017F> T lznO C, H, O.
   When the product of oxidation is treated with water, basic dini-.
troethylate of zinc is produced along with alcohol.
   Neutral dinitroethylate of zinc crystallizes in minute colourless
needles containing half an equivalent of water.           It fuses at 100°
Cent, and gradually becomes anhydrous.              It is very soluble in
water and in alcohol.       Heated  suddenly  in air to about 300° Cent.
it burns rapidly with a bluish green flame.
    Dinitroethylic acid can only exist in dilute solution; it can be
prepared, either by decomposing the zinc salt with dilute sulphuric
acid and distilling in vacuo, or by decomposing the baryta salt by
an exact equivalent of dilute sulphuric acid. The dilute acid thus
N.
prepared possesses a pungent odour, somewhat resembling that of
the nitro-fatty acids, and an acid taste. It reddens litmus paper
strongly, and gradually decomposes even at ordinary temperatures.
               by the carbonates of the various bases, it yields the cor
responding salts. The silver and magnesian salts thus prepared
were analysed.
   The salts of dinitroethylic acid are             all                              in

                                                               water and
alcohol, and most     of  them crystallize with more         less difficulty.
They are    all  violently acted upon         by
                                           concentrated nitric acid, the

ratory nerves and suppression of the respiration, which brings on
convulsions in these animals as a collateral effect.       In frogs the

  The following communications were read:—
  1.  “On the Dichobune ovina, from the Upper Eocene of the Isle
of Wight.”     By Professor Owen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   This paper comprised a detailed description of the lower jaw and
teeth of an Anoplotherioid quadruped (Dichobune ovina, Owen), of
the size of the Xiphodon gracilis, Cuvier, and belonging to the family
that includes Dichobune and Xiphodon. The dental formula, as shown
by these teeth, and by the evidence on their crowns of the presence
of the teeth of the upper jaw, is the typical one in diphyodont
mammalia, viz. incis.
                              +.    Can.      H, premol. +. molars, #. = 44.
Professor Owen, having described the differences of the species
under notice from the allied species D. cervinum, concluded with
some remarks on the relations of the genera Xiphodon and Dichobune,
as illustrated by their dental organs; and pointed out that the
small anoplotherioid Microtherium, so much in some respects re
sembling the Chevrotains of Java, &c., but possessing persistent
upper incisor teeth, probably differed also from the Ruminants in
having a still more simplified structure of the stomach than is pre
sented even by the Chevrotains (Tragulus, in which the third bag or
psalterium is suppressed). Thus nearly                   all

dactyle herbivores are separable from the Ruminants; and    the very                     of
few that remain, the dental evidences are   yet incomplete. Further,

He then mentioned that Mr. Brodie had since made some important
additions S. to this Purbeck fauna (including the Triconodon); and
that Mr.       H. Beckles had more recently obtained numerous addi

premolars, 3–3 and 4–4; molars, 2–2; = 12 and 14 in all. The
author then entered into a very full detailed description of the teeth
and jaw in each of the two species. Plagiaular characteristically
differs from Hypsiprymnus, -1st, by the obliquity of the grooves on
its premolars, the latter genus having the analogous teeth vertically
grooved; 2ndly, by having only two true molars in each ramus of
the jaw, instead of the usual four and occasional three, belonging to
recent marsupials; 3rdly, by the considerable salient angle which the
surfaces of the molar and premolar teeth form, instead of presenting
a uniform level line; 4thly, by the very low relative position of the
articular condyle.      In P. Becklesii the two incisor teeth were large
and   robust,   projecting   upwards at a considerable angle, and the
ramus of the    jaw  was   remarkably   short and deep.       In P. minor the
incisors were more     slender,  pointing   less suddenly upwards, and the
ramus was narrower and more curved.            Dr. Falconer more especially
infers the marsupial    characters of the  genus,    1st, from    Hypsiprym        its
noid resemblances        the grooved
                               in      premolars    and the relative size and
position      the incisors; 2ndly, from the raised and inflected fold
                of                                                                                     of
the posterior and inner margin            the ramus; 3rdly, the form and

                     of           suture.

          On Fish-remains from                  the neighbourhood              of   Ludlow.          387
fishes discovered by Mr. Salwey in the Old Red Sandstone of Acton
Beauchamp, and others by Mr. Lightbody in the upper bone-beds
near Ludlow.       From the first-named locality the author described
a  portion of a cephalic  carapace, indicating a large and new species
of  Cephalaspis   (C. Salweyi).   Another new species of Cephalaspis
(C. Murchisoni) was founded on two specimens obtained by Mr.
Lightbody in a bed below the paper-mill on the river Teme at Lud
low; and a third new species (C. ornatus) was described from spe
cimens from dark micaceous shales in the Hereford Railway Cutting
at Ludlow. The same shales have afforded two specimens of a very
small Cephalaspid of great interest. These are of the size of a four
penny piece, and have a general resemblance to Cephalaspis, except
in the peculiarity of having behind the cephalic shield, and united to
its posterior margin by a distinctly marked suture, a broad plate
divided into lateral halves by a prolongation of the occipital crest.
The author, having stated his reasons for regarding these specimens
as adult and not embryonic individuals, gave this new Cephalaspid
form the generic title Auchenaspis (on account of        nuchal plate),             its
and described      under the specific name

Bollaert, Esq. Communicated by Prof. Owen, F.G.S.
   The author observed, that hitherto there have been few if any
fossil bones of large quadrupeds found on the western side of the Andes.
During his travels in South America, he had diligently searched for
information on the subject; and he had learnt from Mr. G. Smith,
H.B.M.Consul at Santiago de Chile, that some elephantine bones
had been met with in digging a trench to drain the Lake Taguatagua,
in the province of Colchagua, about 45 leagues due south of the
capital, and at an elevation of 2300 feet above the level of the Pacific
Ocean. This lake occupied a circular and crater-like depression
among the third range of hills running N. and S. through Chile.
The skeletons of two animals were found at the depth of about 30 feet
below the margin of the lake.
    Some of the teeth (referred to Mastodon by Don W. Bustilos)
are in the Museum at Santiago, and fragments of the femur and
tibia brought home by Mr. Bollaert have been also referred to Mas
todon by Prof. Owen.

EXPERIMENTS ON THE ARTIFICIAL FORMATION OF THE HYDRATED
  CARBONATES OF THE EARTHS AND METALS.    BY A. DAMOUR.
THE    metallic and earthy carbonates have already been obtained
  artificially in a crystalline state by various processes. Thus when
a soluble salt and an alkaline carbonate are exposed to a high tem
perature in a close vessel, double decomposition takes place, giving
origin to an insoluble and crystalline carbonate. A soluble salt may
also be precipitated by an alkaline bicarbonate in water supersaturated
with carbonic acid. This mixture, placed in an apparatus which
only allows the carbonic acid to escape slowly, and exposed to a
more or less elevated temperature, gives origin to anhydrous crystal
line carbonates. These processes are due to the experiments of M.
Senarimont.
   The solution of an acid salt may be poured into a saturated solu
tion of an alkaline bicarbonate, when the carbonic acid being in excess
exerts a solvent action on the carbonates, and by          its
                                                       slow evaporation
under the simple pressure         the atmosphere, allows the dissolved
                                  of
matters  to  separate and crystallize.         In
                                              this manner, sometimes
simple, sometimes double, hydrated carbonates are obtained.        This

absorb the gas evolved by the action of tartaric acid upon bicar
bonate of soda placed in the other compartment; the apparatus is
then closed.
   After several days of digestion, the liquid, saturated with carbonic
acid and retaining in solution a certain quantity of the oxide with
which it had been in contact, is decanted, and left to spontaneous
evaporation, either in the open air or in loosely stopped bottles. The
hydrated carbonates are then deposited very slowly, either in the
form of pulverulent flakes, or in more or less distinct crystals, some
times several millimetres in diameter. In this way the author has pro
duced a hydrated carbonate of magnesia in large and perfectly trans
parent crystals, by digesting in water charged with carbonic acid, a
mixture of carbonates of lime and magnesia obtained by precipitating
a neutral liquid containing dolomite dissolved in nitric acid by car
bonate of ammonia.           The water dissolved carbonate of lime and a
still  larger   quantity   of carbonate of magnesia. When exposed to
the air it   deposited   from the very first day small acicular crystals of
carbonate of     lime;   then the liquid being reduced to about a sixth of

allow   me to apply this instrument to direct and precise cyanometric
observations.
    To convert this apparatus into a cyanometer, the plate with
double rotation is removed; a Nicol's prism is substituted for the
doubly refracting prism; a jointed screen, consisting of a frame upon
which a sheet of white paper is stretched, is fitted to the objective
extremity of the tube; between the two Nicol's prisms a plate of
quartz of 1 millim. in thickness is placed perpendicularly to the
axis and a thin plate parallel to the axis, giving a violet tint, and
its complementary colour in polarized light. The first of these may
be taken out of the apparatus by a lateral aperture into which the
piece supporting it slides; the second, fixed at one extremity of an
alidade, is placed at the centre of the circle of polarization in a
grooved piece; the rotation of this plate, independent of that of the
analyser, is nevertheless measured upon the same circle by means of
a vernier supported upon the other extremity of the alidade. This
arrangement also allows the plate to be removed to regulate the
                                                                      -
instrument.
    The white light reflected by the screen, after undergoing the
action of the crystalline plates, acquires a tint which depends upon
the inclination of the axis of the thin plate to the plane of the
principal section of the polarizer, and upon the azimuth of the
principal section of the analyser.
    This system, as we shall see hereafter, allows the tint of any part
of the sky to be reproduced with facility; but to operate with
certainty, it is necessary that the intensity of the latter should be
brought to the intensity of that with which it is compared; for this
purpose a second tube, furnished with two Nicol's prisms, is fitted by
grinding into a collar screwed to the first portion of the instrument
parallel to the first; the rays which have traversed these two systems
are completely reflected at a right angle upon the hypothenuses of
 two isosceles right-angled prisms, by means of which the images,
 being brought together until they almost touch, may be examined
 at a single glance.    The instrument being directed to the part of
 the sky to be observed, we try which is the azimuth of the analyser
 of the system for reproducing the tint, for which this tint approaches
 that of the other image most closely; the latter is then brought to
 an intensity exactly equal to the former by a suitable rotation of the
 corresponding analyser; the difference of tint, if it exists, is thus
 more apparent, and may be corrected either by varying the azimuth
 of the analyser of the other system, or by slightly changing the
 inclination of the thin plate, so as to compensate the excess of green
 or violet light which occurs in the primitive tint. This comparison
 is very easily made with a little practice.
    By means of these two angles furnished by observation and the
 known thickness of the two plates of quartz, we may determine
  what I shall call the cyanometric state of a point of the sky, that is
 to say, the relation of the quantity of blue light to that of white
 light, the mixture of which would produce the tint observed by the
  eye.   From the thickness of the plate of quartz, we deduce, as has
  been shown by M. Biot, the rotation of the planes of polarization

relative to the rays of the principal tints of the spectrum; we know
consequently the inclinations of the axis of the thin plate to each of
these planes; we calculate the corresponding intensities of the emer
ging light by means of one of Fresnel's formulae for thin crystalline
plates. Lastly, we apply to these values Newton's rule, reduced to
formulae by M. Biot, which allows us to determine the nature of the
tint and       its
               comparative intensity.

   Eudialite,     mineral which receives its name from the facility
                      a
with which       may it   dissolved by acids, has only been observed

of  Greenland, where       was discovered fourteen years ago by Dr.
                                    it
Giesecke.     The numerous specimens which have been since collected
in the same locality, exhibit this substance associated with sodalite
and Arfvedsonite.
  More recently            a    mineral has been found                  in   the zirconian                 syenite
of   Brevig, Norway, the physical and chemical characters
                 in                                         which                                     of
have much analogy with those     eudialite.  This new mineral was

I     of
         HAVE attempted to establish a general theory of the motion
         electricity in an infinitely thin wire, by assuming certain
facts which are observed in constant currents, and in currents
whose intensity alters but slowly, to be universally valid.           will                          I
here develope this theory, and show           application       its
                                                              some cases                  to

mencement of the wire, or when         the potential is always  s-0,

value depending upon the electromotive force of the circuit.
When K denotes the electromotive force, this value must be #K.
The conditions to be satisfied by the expressions for e and i
are therefore the following:—

   On account of the first condition, we must have the quantities
A'-0 and also a-0. As for                           s-l,

  For values of t, for which the number p is not very great, the
expression for io is capable of a considerable simplification. For
such the quantity ht is infinitely small; and by neglecting mem
bers of higher orders, the equation for io may be thus written:
                                  io=J.2ht             + J2h(2pT-t),

      GENTLEMEN,                                        May 6, 1857.
            frequent appearance of late in your publication, of
THE    memoirs concerning the doctrine of parallel lines, assuring
me that the subject continues to possess an interest,         I have ven
tured to request insertion for the enclosed article, which has
just been printed in a ‘Cyclopaedia of the Physical Sciences,’
edited by myself.     It contains views not touched by your corre
spondents.      I shall not say that those views do, in my own
opinion, exclude the applicability of other modes of solving the
difficulty, or that they are in themselves free from objection.
Nevertheless, I think that principles are indicated there, which
must command a prominent place in any successful attempt to
regenerate our elementary geometry.          It is certainly out of rule

to ask you to accept an extract from a published work: but, in
the present case, the volume is only just published; and as it is
of a miscellaneous nature, the brief article of which a copy is
now sent, may easily escape the notice of those of your corre
spondents who take a critical interest in the very curious subject
under discussion.
                           am, Gentlemen,  I

                                           Parallel Lines.
     “The characteristic of      two lines in the same plane, to which
the name of      parallel is  given   in geometry, is simply this, -that
although produced ever so far either way they will never meet.
The theory of these lines continues a stain on our elementary
science.      It is easy to prove, that if certain conditions are ful
filled when two lines cut a transverse line, these two will never
meet, or must be parallel; but to establish the converse,                       to
prove, viz. that if the two lines are parallel, these same conditions
are lawfully predicable, has hitherto defied the logic of                    geo                         all
meters—a fact certainly most remarkable                  this purely deduct    in

existence     ofsuch     defect unquestionably argues some oversight
                             a
              of  geometrical axioms, the oversight                                           of
                                                                                                                 it of

some    of  our   primal    perceptions    regarding     magnitude:       but
does not follow that the missing axiom has immediate relation
to  parallels,     or
                    that     ought

specific proposition           which the acknowledged difficulty first
                                   at
appears.       On the very contrary,          may       asserted with abun
                                                            it                 be

followed—to       supply   the  deficiency       new   postulatesby       axioms                    or

  If a  test-tube containing benzole and another with the new
substance be placed in an appropriate freezing mixture, the ben
zole, as is well known, solidifies at 0°C.; but not so the other
hydrocarbon, which, indeed,                    I
                                 have not been able to obtain in
the solid form.    The odour of the new hydrocarbon is slightly
alliaceous, and more disagreeable than that of pure benzole.

yields two nitro-substitution products: of the preparation and
properties of these I will now give the details.  For the prepa
ration of the first nitro-compound, five volumes of pure nitric
acid, of spec. grav. 1.5, were taken, and two volumes of the hy
drocarbon added in small portions to the nitric acid, which was
kept cool. When the                 oil

mixture was allowed             to
                          stand aside for an hour.  At the end of
that time the whole was thrown into water, and the heavy oil
which settled washed first with water, and then with                dilute                           a

According to my determinations, the fusing-point of dinitro
benzole crystallized from alcohol is 85°5, and the solidifying
point 83°5; but on repeating the experiment with a preparation
purified by recrystallization from water,              I
                                            found the fusing-point
to be  88°, and the solidifying-point 86°.
   The original hydrocarbon left in contact with Nordhausen
sulphuric acid for some days, perfectly dissolves with the produc
tion of a reddish colour. Four volumes of sulphuric acid were
employed for each volume of parabenzole.                         If
                                                                the solution be
thrown into water the colours disappear,                     and an acid which
yields a soluble baryta-salt is found in the liquid. This baryta
salt is deposited only when the solution has reached a very con
siderable degree of concentration, and exhibits traces only of
crystalline structure. . It is almost insoluble in dry aether, very
slightly soluble in absolute alcohol. It may be purified by
washing with aether (whereby a yellow colouring matter is re
moved), and solution in dilute alcohol. An analysis gave the
following numbers:—
     ‘434 grim. of salt gave 2215 grm. Sulphate of baryta.
   This corresponds to 51.03 per cent. of sulphate of baryta.
   The formula            C*H*Ba?S0°   requires 51.22 p. c.           of BaSO4

   Thus there is no doubt, that although the boiling-point of the
original hydrocarbon is much nearer that of toluole than that
of benzole, yet the new substance is really an isomer of the
latter body. The copper-salt of the sulpho-acid, prepared by
precipitating the baryta-salt with sulphate of copper, is exceed
ingly soluble in water, and unlike the beautiful sulphobenzolate
of copper, requires the microscope to show that it possesses a
crystalline structure, for it is not without action on polarized
light.
   The copper-salt, treated with sulphuretted hydrogen, deposits
brown sulphide of copper; and when filtered from this and heated
to separate sulphuretted hydrogen, the solution contains an acid
giving no precipitate with carbonate of baryta, but dissolving it
abundantly, becoming neutral, and yielding on evaporation the
original baryta-salt, but in a state of perfect purity.
   The sulpho-acid crystallizes from                  its

 gave the following results, the copper being precipitated by pot
 ash and determined as oxide:–
            '482 grim. of salt gave '0995 grim. of oxide of copper.
 This corresponds to 16:51 per cent. of metallic copper, while the

 dried at 100° C.

the association, nor availed themselves of it as a means of clas
sification. On the contrary, although the groupings of the ele
ments are as real and certain as the natural families of plants and
animals, yet we find constantly, in our systematic treatises, that
bodies manifesting the strongest analogies are widely separated
from one another, while bodies belonging to very different groups
are conventionally associated.
    The existence of certain important natural families has been
successively pointed out by different chemists.            propose to           I
make some modifications in the groupings hitherto proposed, to
construct a few new groups, and to point out the principal ana
logies by which the members of each particular group, old or
new, are associated; relying chiefly upon well-known recorded
facts, but occasionally introducing fresh experiments and obser
vations.
    The most prominent relations which obtain among the elements
are the relation of parity or equality, and the relation of series
or gradation; but an aliquot or multiple relation is also occasion
ally manifested”. The relation of parity is illustrated in the
case of the twin-metals nickel and cobalt, and the relation of
series in the triad chlorine, bromine, and iodine.      The multiple
relation is not shown by any such glaring instance. Some ap
parently multiple relations may indeed be only uncompleted
relations of gradation, of which occurrence palladium and plati
num afford a possible example; while other numerically multiple
relations are scarcely supported by analogy of properties, as
happens with platinum and gold.         Frequently, however, we find
that two proportions of one metal are isomorphous with one pro
portion of another, as is the case with copper and silver.
    In attempting a natural classification of the elements, we must
                                                                    or be all
have regard, though not an equal regard, to            the properties
they manifest;          orother words,

 a general   correspondence; but iron manifests a tendency to form
persalts, copper to form subsalts, and hence the two metals are
usually widely separated in our classifications.         hope to show              I
that   they  form with nickel a most characteristic natural family.
Again, arsenic produces acid oxides, and bismuth basic oxides;
                                   .
but the antagonism disappears on the introduction of antimony
as an intermediate term.                             I
                                   am inclined, indeed, to place great
confidence in gradational differences, not as a means for sever
ance, but for association.
    That certain natural families have not long ago been recog
nized and made available in practice, has arisen,         believe, from             I
the accordance of an undue consideration to certain unimportant
 differences.     Our attention has been arrested by the most su
perficial rather than by the most fundamental characters.             For
instance, the sulphydrate of magnesium is soluble in water,
that of zinc in                water, that of cadmium in moderately
strong acids.      Hence the three metals, despite their great ana
logies, have been referred to three artificial classes.        The point
 I wish to establish       that,        is,

   The atomic weight             and specific   gravity of fluorine, or 19, is
rather more than half             that of chlorine.
   Chlorine, bromine              and iodine, when in the liquid or solid
state, have, according            to Kopp, the same atomic volume, namely
160.    Bromine and iodine have sensibly the same atomic heat;
6-7 and 6.8 respectively.      All four bodies in the free state mani
fest powerful affinities.    Fluorine, however, appears to be by far
the most energetic.       Chlorine, bromine, and iodine are capable
of replacing hydrogen    by equivalent substitution in a great variety
of compounds,    mineral and organic; in the latter, more espe
cially, with but a slight modification in the properties of the
original bodies.    Analogous fluorides, chlorides, bromides, and
iodides are for the most part isomorphous.        The fluorides, chlo
rides, &c. of hydrogen and the basylous metals have a great
tendency to unite with the protochlorides, bichlorides, and ter
chlorides, &c. of the chlorous metals. The chloride, bromide, and
iodide of hydrogen yield a large number of corresponding oxides,
thus:–

acid. One gaseous atomic volume of the element unites with
two gaseous atomic volumes of hydrogen to form two gaseous
volumes of the compound,-the                     condensation          consequently
amounting to one-third.           Sulphur, selenium, and tellurium ex
hibit a marked similarity and gradation of properties. Oxygen
manifests a general resemblance to the other three terms, and
appears to bear towards them much the same relation that fluo
rine bears to chlorine, bromine and iodine. The atomic weights
and vapour-densities occur in sequence:–
                S   =    32             239-2            -

    The atomic weight and specific gravity of oxygen, or 16, is
exactly half that of sulphur.         The specific heat of the atoms of
sulphur, selenium and tellurium, is double that of most of the
metals*. The atomic volumes of sulphur and selenium, or 101
and 103 respectively, are sensibly equal. The number for tel
lurium is 128, the want of relation being possibly due to a want
of correspondence in allotropic condition.
    Oxygen and sulphur, possibly also selenium and tellurium,
unite with hydrogen in a second, and probably in several other
proportions. The series, including some derived members, is as

stance of the direct replacement of hydrogen or chlorine by
oxygen or sulphur.    We are, however, acquainted with a consi
derable number of bodies which may be conceived as arising from
such a substitution, two atoms of chlorine or hydrogen being
represented by one equivalent of oxygen or sulphur.   Thus—

   We have seen that the simple atom of sulphate of potash,
K*SO",     may be represented as consisting of oxide of potassium
united with sulphuric anhydride, K*O. SO°. The double atoms
of monobasic and terbasic salts may be represented in a similar
manner; and doubling the atom of the bibasic salt for the sake
of analogy, we have the following sequence:–
      2KIO*      =      K20. I*07         .   .   Periodate of potash.
      2K*SO4 = 2K20. Sº 0°                .   .   Sulphate of potash.
      2K*P04     –    3K20. PO%           .   .   Phosphate of potash.
   The corresponding formulae for the chromates and iodates will
be—
                      2KIO3           =      K2O   .  I2O5
                      2K2 Cr3 O4 = 2K2O            .  Cr3 O6.
    Now there are certain salts, mono-, bi- and ter-basic, in which
the ratio of oxide to anhydride differs from the above normal
proportion.      The salts with an excess of oxide are termed basic
salts; the salts with an excess of anhydride, anhydrosalts. As
instances of anhydrosalts, we have—
        Monobasic.                 Bibasic,                 Tribasic.
      K2O. I2O5               2K2O. Cr3 O6               3K2O.      P2 O5

the different salts, though simpler formulae are preferable for
general use, Thus—

  from Berzelius's experiments, the number for silicon would be

     sents a curious relation with that of boron,                      = 14.7, or

in which condition only do they conduct electricity. Titanium,
like boron and silicon, is extremely infusible.
   Tin forms a prothydrate, SnO. HºO; a protoxide, SnO; and
a  protochloride, SnCl4, &c.        Titanium undoubtedly forms a
protoxide, which, like that of tin, is of a brown colour. There
is also some reason to believe that both silicon and boron form
protoxides.
   The members of this fourth group are remarkable for their
fluorine compounds.        We have three simple fluorides, BF*, SiF“,
TiF". I have ascertained, moreover, that tin yields an analogous
compound, Sn F**. These fluorides are             formed           all

acids, alkalies, and probably in water.        One modification of
stannic acid is soluble in dilute acids, alkalies, and sparingly in
water.   From soluble borates, silicates, titanates and stannates,
the hydrated acids are precipitated by the addition of nearly any
other acid however feeble. The four elements form correspond

442                Prof. Schönbein on the Connea-ion of
in contact with    number of inorganic and organic substances.
                        a
Phosphorus, as need scarcely be mentioned, is especially distin
guished among inorganic substances.       When shaken in a finely
divided condition with   atmospheric   air and solution of indigo,
the latter is decomposed with tolerable rapidity at ordinary tem
peratures, and very rapidly at a somewhat higher temperature.
    We are no longer surprised at this action; for we know now,
that under these circumstances phosphorus ozonizes atmospheric
oxygen; and the decomposition of the indigo solution can be
effected even without the presence of phosphorus, that                                              is,    by
first leaving atmospheric air for some time      contact with phos   in
phorus, then removing the phosphorus, and shaking the air thus
treated with the tincture    indigo.      of  scarcely necessary
                                                           It   is                                         to
say that this action   producedis                 by
                                    the oxygen allotropized      the                                by
phosphorus.
   Among organic substances, the camphene oils and common
aether are similar     their comportment
                               in                phosphorus; with    to
this difference, however, that these substances act less power
fully than the latter body, and that their activity           essentially            is
increased     bylight,  while that    phosphorus ofappears        wholly                to     be
independent        of
                    this agent.    This chemically exciting influence
   conveniently proved with water which has been coloured blue
byis              indigo, and which      brought                                                     oil

decayed wood, brought into contact with sound wood, furthers
the decay of the latter in a most surprising manner.      We see,

                                     it
in  the decay     nitrogenous organic substances arises from the

    My experiments      have shown that distinct traces of nitric acid are
formed    during   the combustion of phosphorus in atmospheric air,
and as the ozonized oxygen is capable of oxidizing the atmospheric
nitrogen to the same acid in the presence of a fixed base, it seems
to me possible that even in the decay of non-nitrogenous sub
stances in atmospheric air under certain circumstances, for ex
ample the presence of alkaline bases, small quantities at any rate

have recently acquired,                       I
                                  need scarcely remark how desirable it

trates are produced in the decay of nitrogenous organic sub
stances under the conditions mentioned.                If the question were
answered in the      affirmative,     we should become acquainted with
a new source from which            plants   might derive the requisite                                     ni

Now if the spontaneous act of decomposition   of the peroxide of
hydrogen were, as such, the immediate cause of the decomposition
of the oxide of gold, we should expect that the action would not
be greater than the cause; that is to say, that the decomposition
of the more permanent oxide of gold, or of the peroxide of hy
drogen itself, would not be more active than the original spon
taneous decomposition of the latter compound.
   But since, as experiment shows, the noble metals effect the
decomposition of peroxide of hydrogen with just as much activity
as their oxides, it must be assumed that in these cases the cause
of decomposition lies in the metals themselves.    From their ele
mentary nature, however, these bodies cannot be in a state of
decomposition, and they cannot therefore transfer such a state
of decomposition to the peroxide of hydrogen; and hence the
immediate cause of the more rapid decomposition of these bodies.
effected by metallic gold, &c., must be sought for in something
else than in the transference of the chemical activity of one sub
stance to another.     However this may be, it appears possible
that the action exerted by gold and by                       its
                                            oxide upon peroxide

iodide of potassium and oxygen, or that at which free iodine de
composes with potash into iodide of potassium and oxygen,
   Now if the breaking up of iodate of potash into iodine, oxygen
and, potash, is really occasioned by a change of condition which
the O of iodic acid suffers under the influence of peroxide of
manganese, &c.; if there are many other cases of the decompo
sition of compounds containing 0, and if it be further the fact
that organic substances also, as such, can exert an allotropic
action upon common oxygen by inducing a series of chemical
changes in other organic substances, it might also appear pro
bable that yeast acts allotropically upon one or the other consti
tuent of sugar, or so as to produce a change of condition.
   Assuming that such an influence were really exerted, sugar
could just as little retain                    its its

                        muscles at rest, and

    a. The electro-motive power of a cut muscle is independent of the
size   of its transverse section.                                                                          -
     b. The electro-motive power                              increases          with the length                 of the
muscle.
     c.   The electro-motive property of the muscles of living or recently
killed animals is greater in mammals and birds than in fish and
amphibia.      The duration of this force, which in all cases decreases
most   rapidly  in the first moments after death, is greater in fish and
amphibia than in the higher orders of animals.
    d. The nerves have no direct influence on the electro-motive force
                                             all                                            an

perceive          no

impossible to conceive that the change of form which takes place in
a muscle during contraction may be momentarily followed by the
inversion of the muscular current in the exterior arc. He observes,
that examples are not wanting, taken from certain cases of electro
dynamic induction, and also of voltaic circuits, in which this inversion
of the current can be obtained by a change in the form, or relative
distance of different parts of the circuit; but he adds, that this is a
new field of inquiry, which cannot be given up to merely hypothetical
W16WS.
   The last section of the paper is devoted to the consideration of the
mechanical effects of muscular contraction; and experiments are
stated with a view to compare the effective work of a muscular con
traction, as determined empirically with the work calculated according
to the principles of the dynamical theory of heat.
   Employing the dynamometer already described in the fourth series
of his researches, the author has found that the mechanical work
effected by a single contraction of the gastrocnemius muscle of a
frog may be expressed by 0:00001457 kilogramme-metres.           Deter
mining next the quantity of zinc required to be oxidated in the pile
in order to excite a single contraction, he finds that the force de
veloped by the muscle is enormously greater than could be accounted
for on the supposition that it is produced by the conversion into
muscular energy of the equivalent of electricity corresponding to the
quantity of zinc oxidated.      He accordingly concludes, that the
electric current which excites a muscle to action does not represent
the force exerted by the muscle, which is more probably to be
referred to the chemical changes, such as oxidation, which take
place in the muscular tissue during contraction. The consideration
of this branch of the inquiry will form the subject of the second part
of the Memoir.

Mr. Ellis         on the nature             of the Involuntary Muscular Fibre.                                    457
are at variance with those now generally received.                        The present
communication contains the results of these                 inquiries,   which tend to
show that the voluntary and involuntary muscles resemble each
other very closely in the arrangement and constitution of their fibres.
   After adverting to the present state of opinion on the subject, the
author gives an account of his own observations, and treats successively
of the interweaving of the fibres, their size, form, and ultimate
structure; their mode of attachment at their extremities, their length,
and the corpuscles connected with them.                   He devotes a section also
to the   question   of the   periodic   formation and destruction of muscular
fibres in the uterus, in its different conditions; and while he is led
by his own investigations to recognize an enlargement in size of the
individual fibres of that organ during pregnancy, followed by subse
quent diminution, he is unable to confirm the doctrine of new forma
tion.     Moreover, he finds that during pregnancy a considerable
amount of granular matter, with round or oval granular-cells, is
deposited among the fibres.              He adduces reasons for believing that
this substance cannot be            regarded      as a blastema, nor             bedded            its      in

          On the Lunar-diurnal Magnetic Variation at Toronto.                                                               459
     producing in every lunar day a variation which is distinctly appre
º
tº
     ciable, in each of the three elements, by the instruments adopted and
     recommended in the Report of the Committee of Physics of the
     Royal Society, when due care is taken in conducting the observa
     tions, and suitable methods are employed in elaborating the results.
        2. That the lunar diurnal variation in each of the three elements
     constitutes a double progression in each lunar day; the declination
     having two easterly and two westerly maxima, and the inclination
     and total force each two maxima and two minima between two suc
     cessive passages of the moon over the astronomical meridian ; the
     variation passing in every case four times through zero in the lunar
     day. The approximate range of the lunar-diurnal variation at To
     ronto is 38" in the declimation, 4". 5 in the inclination, and '000012
     part of a total force.
        3. That the lunar-diurnal variation thus obtained appears to be
     consistent with the hypothesis that the moon’s magnetism                                                            is,     in
     great part                not wholly, derived                                      by

     magnetism       the earth.
         4. That there             is    no
                                appearance                         in

460                                              Royal Society:—
    By    such a reduction of a p-edral q-acron P to P', of                                             P' to P'', &c.,
P can     be shown to be generable from a certain pyramid                                               II; by which
it ismeant that II is the highest-ranked pyramid to which P can by
such reduction be reduced.
   Hereby it is evident that the problem of enumeration of the r-edra
is brought down to this: to determine how many (r--m)-edra are
generable from the r-edral pyramid.
   The autopolars so generable are first considered, as the heteropolars
are obtained by combination and selection of those operations with
which the theory of the autopolars makes us acquainted.
   Autopolarity is of three kinds, modal, enodal, and utral.
   Every even-based pyramid is nodally autopolar; i. e. it cannot
but have two nodal summits.           For example, the 5-edral and
7-edral pyramids    have the  signatures   of their faces and summits
thus arranged,—

     The following communication was read:—
  “On the Species of Mastodon and Elephant occurring fossil in
Great Britain.—Part I. Mastodon.” By H. Falconer, M.D., F.R.S.,
F.G.S.
   The object of this communication is to ascertain what are the species
of the Proboscidea found fossil in Britain; what the specific names
which ought to be applied to them; and what the principal forma
tions and localities where they are elsewhere met with in Europe.
The Mastodon of the Crag forms the subject of this first part of the
memoir: the second part will treat of the Elephant-remains found
in Britain.    The author commenced by insisting on the importance
to geology that every mammal found in the fossil state should be
defined as regards, first,                   its
                                      specific distinctness; and, secondly,
its  range       existence geographically and
                 of                                      time, with    inmuch              as
severe exactitude as the available materials and the state of our
knowledge will admit. He observed that with regard                the remains        to
of  the proboscidean genera, Dinotherium, Mastodon, and Elephant,

molars, and by the ridges ranging from six up to an indefinite
number in these teeth, in different groups of species.            Dr. Falconer
arranges the numerous fossil and recent forms in three natural sub
genera, founded on the ridge-formula, in conjunction with other
characters.     In the Stegodon (comprising besides other forms the
Mastodon elephantoides, Clift) the ridge-formula is hypisomerous;
and the ridges number six or eight. The Lorodon (including the
African Elephant) is also hypisomerous, and has from seven to mine
plates or ridges.       The Euelephas (including the Elephas indicus
and six fossil species) is the largest and most important group,
and comprises the typical Elephants having thin-plated molars.
Here the ridge-formula is anisomerous, and regulated by progressive
increments, as 8, 12, 16; the higher                               its

                                     at

Cuvier had also done), Dr. Falconer gave           detail the history          in
 ofthe discovery and publication    the true M. angustidens (Cuvier),
                                                         of
and     the M. arvernensis and M. longirostris.
       of                                             He then passed

464                         Geological Society   :-
in review the opinions and statements of these authors, as well as
of Blainville, Laurillard, Gervais, Pomel, Lartet, and Sismonda, on
these species, and on the specimens which these observers had
severally described, sometimes under additional specific names.
He then described the characteristic peculiarities both of the molars
and of the symphysis of the lower jaws in these three species;
and showed that the molars from the Crag Mastodon were, like
those of Tetral. arvernensis, characterized by four-ridged molars,
with their conical points more or less alternating, and with their
valleys blocked up; and that they essentially differed from the molars
of the Triloph. angustidens from Simorre, Dax, &c., and from the
Tetral. longirostris of Eppelsheim.     The M. arvernensis of Mont
pellier, Auvergne, Italy, &c. had no lower tusks; and the author is of
opinion that the only specimen which has been figured and described
as one of the lower tusks of the Crag Mastodon is a terminal fragment
of one of the upper tusks of that species.
   From osteological considerations it appears that Tetral. arver
nensis was of a low and heavy make ; that Tetral. longirostris was
of similar general proportions; and that Triloph. angustidens was
higher in its limbs and of a comparatively light and slender shape.
   In his observations on the geological age and associated faunas
of the formations in which these species severally occur, Dr. Falconer
observed that Trilophodon angustidens is a characteristic species of
the miocene falunian beds throughout Europe, and is associated with
Triloph, tapiroides in the Faluns of France and the upper freshwater
Molasse of Switzerland.     Tetralophodon longirostris is an important
member of the Eppelsheim fauna, which, though                        its
                                                          determination
is accompanied with great difficulty, appears               to

Switzerland.     The Tetralophodon arvernensis           characteristic
                                                           is              the           of

                        it   had   a                             habitat over
Europe, accompanying Lowodon meridionalis (Nesti)                 Tuscany,

Mastodon remains occur          in  the British strata, Dr. Falconer con
cludes   that,-1st.     The Mastodon remains which have been met with
in the Fluvio-marine and Red Crags belong              pliocene form, namely

   The specimen described was found in a coprolitic mass from the
bone-bed of Aust passage, by E. Higgins, Esq.            It consists of a
carapace and four abdominal segments. The former is smooth, sub
rectangular, with the eyes widely separated, and has three longitu
dinal ridges, and a cervical furrow extending right across the carapace.
The latter are sculptured somewhat after the pattern of Nephrops and
are two lines in length altogether.     Some small fragments of subtri
gonal limbs accompany the carapace. After comparing the spe
cimen with the known forms of Stomapoda and Macrura, the
author concludes by stating that it appears to be a Decapodous
Crustacean presenting certain points of resemblance to Scyllarus
and Nephrops, but not assignable to any existing genus.      Mr.
Gould      names    it Tropifer lavis.
   2. “Description of a Crustacean (Pygocephalus Cooperi) from the
Coal-measures.”     By Prof. Huxley, F.G.S.
   This new and remarkable Crustacean is represented by three
specimens in ironstone nodules; each presenting, from the breakage
of the nodules, the ventral surface in relief, with the corresponding
impression.   Two of the specimens are the property of R. S. Cooper,
Esq., of Bilston, and were obtained from the shale overlying the
upper or thick coal-beds of that place, and were associated with
fragments of Pecopteris. The other specimen belongs to the Man
chester Museum, and was derived from the coal-shales at Medlock
Park Bridge. The animal is about 13 inch in length;            ventral                      its
surface presents    one extremity

           GENTLEMEN,                                                    May 18, 1857.
  I regret that Dr. Noad's disinterested conduct to a stranger should
have induced Mr. Hearder to make such statements as those which
appeared in the Philosophical Magazine of this month.       He there
intimates that Dr. Noad introduced the instrument of his friend
 during a lecture given at the Polytechnic Institution, thereby doing
him (Mr. Hearder) a commercial injury.          Now I had seen Dr. Noad
but once before that lecture was delivered, I could not therefore have
been honoured by his friendship; and had I been so fortunate, would
 it have been just to suppress my humble attempts at improvement
 for the sake of Mr. Hearder's pecuniary advantage 2
    With regard to Mr. Hearder's claim to the honour of having
introduced the improved induction coil into this country, I may state
 that the coil which was exhibited at the Polytechnic Institution on
 the 29th of September, was commenced in January and finished in
 March 1856. This is not of much importance; and I should not
have named        had it,not been stated that had constructed my coil
                                 it                              I

            have some  slight  share              of
                                        the credit for such   improvement,
 although there may        others working

    Sir John Herschel, as far as I am aware, is the only person who

LXIII.      On the Sounds produced by the Combustion           of Gases in  .
                Tubes.     By John TYNDALL, F.R.S.*
    N the first     volume of Nicholson's Journal, published in
      1802, the sounds produced by the combustion of hydrogen
in tubes are referred to as having been “made in Italy:” Dr.
Higgins, in the same place, shows that he had discovered them
in the year 1777, while observing the water formed in a glass
vessel by the slow combustion of a slender stream of hydrogen.
Chladni, in his ‘Akustik,’ published in 1802, page 74, speaks
of their being mentioned, and incorrectly explained, by De Luc
in his ‘New Ideas on Meteorology:’          I  do not know the date of
the volume.       Chladni himself showed that the tones produced
were the same as those of an open pipe of the same length as
the tube which encompassed the flame.             He also succeeded in
obtaining a tone and its octave from the same tube, and in one
 case obtained the fifth of the octave.        In a paper published in
the Journal de Physique in 1802, G. De la Rive endeavoured to
 account for the sounds by referring them to the alternate con
 traction and expansion of aqueous vapour; basing his opinion
 upon a series of experiments of great beauty and ingenuity
 made with the bulbs of thermometers.             In 1818 Mr. Faraday
 took up the      subjecti,   and showed that the tones were pro
 duced when the glass tube was enveloped by an atmosphere higher
 in temperature      than 212° Fahr. That they were not due to
 aqueous vapour, was further shown by the fact that they could
 be produced by the combustion of carbonic oxide.              He referred
 the sounds to successive explosions produced by the periodic
 combination, of the atmospheric oxygen with the issuing jet of
 hydrogen gas. This is undoubtedly the true source of the
 sounds.
    I  am not aware that the dependence of the pitch of the note
 on the size of the flame has as yet been noticed.            To this point
 I  will, in the first place, briefly direct attention.

   The 25-inch tube was now brought over the same flame;                                                              it

  In    the first experiments                 I
                                made use of a tapering brass jet
10# inches long, and having a superior orifice about 35th of an
inch in diameter.     The shaking of the singing flame within the
glass tube, when the voice was properly pitched, was so manifest
as to be seen by several hundred people at once.
   I, placed a syrene within a few feet of the singing-flame, and
gradually heightened the note produced by the instrument. As
 the sounds of the flame and syrene approached perfect unison,
the flame shook, jumping up and down within the tube.         The
interval between the jumps became greater until the unison was
perfect, when the motion ceased for an instant; the syrene still
increasing in pitch, the motion of the flame again appeared, the
jumpings became quicker and quicker, until finally it escaped
 cognizance by the eye.
    This experiment showed that the jumping of the flame,
 observed by M. Schaffgotsch, is the optical expression of the
 beats which occur at each side of the perfect unison: the beats
could be heard in exact accordance with the shortening and
lengthening of the flame.   Beyond the region of these beats, in
both directions, the sound of the syrene produced no visible mo
tion of the flame. What is true of the syrene is true of the voice.
   While repeating and varying these experiments,      once had a               I
silent flame within a tube, and on pitching my voice to the note
of the tube, the flame, to my great surprise, instantly started
into song. Placing the finger on the end of the tube and silen
cing the melody, on repeating the experiment the same result
was obtained.
   I  placed the syrene near the flame, as before. The latter was
burning tranquilly within                     its
                                  tube. Ascending gradually from

           of                                   the tube which sur  of
rounded the gas flame, the latter suddenly stretched itself and
commenced            its
                  song, which continued indefinitely after the syrene
had ceased       to

flame, the jumpings are seen at exactly the same intervals as
those in which the beats are heard.    When the tuning-fork is
brought over a resonant jar or bottle, the beats may be heard
and the jumpings seen by a thousand people at once. By chan
ging the load upon the tuning-fork, or by slightly altering the size
of the flame, the quickness with which the beats succeed each
other may be changed, but in                                  all

   The mere clapping of the hands, producing an explosion, shout
ing at an incorrect pitch, shaking of the tube surrounding the
flame, are, when the arrangements are properly made, ineffectual.
Each of these modes of disturbance doubtless affects the flame,
but the impulses do not accumulate, as in the case where the
note of the tube itself is struck.  It appears as if the flame
were deaf to a single impulse, as the tympanum would probably
be, and like the latter, needs the accumulation of impulses to give
it sufficient motion. A difference of half a tone between two
tuning-forks is sufficient to cause one of these to set the flame
singing, while the other is powerless to produce this effect.
    I have said that the voice must be pitched to the note of the
tube which surrounds the flame; it would be more correct to
say the note produced by the flame when singing.                   In       cases                   all
this note    is sensibly higher than that due           the open tube which

showing these experiments, the same result is obtained when an
opera glass is moved to and fro before the eye.
   But the most convenient mode of observing the flame is with a
mirror; and it can be seen either directly in the mirror, or by
projection upon a screen.
   A lens of 33 centimeters focus was placed in front of a flame
of common gas, upwards of an inch long, and a paper screen was
hung at about 6 or 8 feet distance behind the flame. In front of
the lens, a small looking-glass was held which received the light
that had passed through the lens, and reflected it back upon the
screen placed behind the latter.           By adjusting the position of
the  lens,   a well-defined inverted   image   of the flame was obtained
upon the screen. On moving the mirror the image was displaced,
and owing to the retention of the impression by the retina,
when the movement was sufficiently specdy, the image described
a continuous luminous track.             Holding the mirror still, the
6-foot 9-inch tube was       placed  over the flame: the latter changed
 itsshape the moment           commencedit       sound, remaining how
                                                                  to
ever well defined upon the screen.           On now moving the mirror,
a totally different effect was produced: instead              continuous               of   a
track      light,
             of       series   adistinct  images

                                        these images apart varied with
the motion          the mirror; and,

  The mutual resemblance of these three metals is admitted on
allhands.   Their chief points   association are the following.

   The three metals are soft, fusible, volatile, and         low specific       of
gravity; they decompose water                                 all

                                                        at
readily combustible.        Each metal forms only one class         salts.                 of
Nearly   all the salts are soluble        water, and undecomposed by
                                                   in
heat.     Corresponding potassium, sodium, and probably lithium
salts are isodimorphous; but the isomorphism                the group       of                  is
not   striking,  inasmuch          the  corresponding
                                         as             salts frequently

    Allchemists are agreed in their association of these three
metals into one group, which, however, is usually made to                                      in

relation of the atomic weights, that of strontium being interme
diate between the other two.

  The saline atomic volumes of the three metals, as estimated
by Kopp, present us with a similar sequence:—
              Ca = 60             311
              Sr = 108            ==1037

                      Sum  311
   The three metals are soft, readily fusible, decompose water at
in all
    temperatures, are easily combustible, and oxidize rapidly even
   dry air. Each metal forms only one class          salts.  The hy        of
drates, sulphides, sulphydrates, chlorides, and nitrates are soluble
in water; the carbonates, sulphates, borates, and phosphates are
insoluble.    The carbonates are        decomposed     all  red heat.
                                                                                 at

Of the three sulphates, that                  the most soluble, then

                                   The corresponding salts are for
the most part isomorphous.      Thus BaCl. HºO           isomorphous            is
with CaCl. H2O, and SrC1.3H2O with CaCl.3H2O. Witherite                                         is
isomorphous with calc-spar, strontianite with arragonite.      Heavy

   The metals     the fifth and sixth groups are the only ones
                      of
that form decidedly soluble hydrates and sulphides. The so
luble sulphates        of
                    lithium and sodium are associated with the                                 in

   These three metals are generally distributed in three separate
groups, notwithstanding that many of their analogies are ex
tremely well known. In this group, as in the preceding, we have
the remarkable sequence of the atomic weights:—
                      Mg =            12:16                100-36

  The three atomic volumes, as determined by Kopp, present                                a
similar sequence:—
                     Mg = 40

   The number for magnesium is the saline volume.                  Those for
zinc and cadmium represent both the primitive and the saline
volumes.     All three metals are soft, white, readily fusible, mal
leable, and crystallize in octahedra.            Magnesium is the least
volatile; zinc, from              its
                               volatility,      prepared  is               by

while cadmium          one of the most volatile
                        is                                           of

    We have no determination of the specific gravities or atomic
volumes of the metals, but the specific gravities of the oxides
occur in gradation,-G*O =2-96, Y”0=482, and Th’O=94.
The three elements are found allied in nature as constituents of
different varieties of gadolinite. The metals themselves have an
iron-grey colour, exhibit after burnishing a metallic lustre, are
infusible or difficultly fusible, are not oxidized by air or water at
ordinary temperatures, are combustible at a red heat, and burn
in oxygen with great brilliancy. The three oxides are infusible,
and are scarcely soluble in acids after ignition.       The three hy
drates are insoluble in water, absorb carbonic acid from the air,
and decompose solutions of ammoniacal salts when boiled there
with.    The salts have for the most part an acid reaction, and are
decomposed at a red heat provided the acid be volatile.            The
three chlorides are volatile and deliquescent.           The hydrated
chlorides are decomposed by ignition, with evolution of chlor
hydric acid. Each metal forms with potassium a double sul
phate, in which the potassium and other metal occur in the pro
portion of equivalent to equivalent.

                                        that of Group VIII.
    These three elements are found associated in nature in similar
 minerals. Eudyalite contains both cerium and zirconium.             In
 eukolite from Norway we have a partial isomorphous replace
 ment of cerium for zirconium (Damour).                  Uranium and
 cerium occur respectively together with yttrium in yttro-tan
 talite and yttro-cerite.    All three metals are found associated
 with tantalic acid. Zirconium and cerium are each found in
 combination with titanic acid.        All three metals form sesqui
 oxides.   Cerium and uranium also give rise to proto- and          in
 termediate oxides.     The sulphates of zirconium and cerium are
 both   precipitated  by sulphate of potash.     Zirconium probably
 presents a relation of parity with norium and ilmenium, cerium
 with lanthanium and didymium.          Aluminium seems to be asso
 ciated more with this    group  than with any other. The charac
 ters of metallic zirconium correspond exactly with those accorded
 to aluminium prior to the researches of Deville.         Uranium, like
 aluminium, is a white malleable metal, not readily oxidizable

3.2, 3-0 respectively. They have the same primitive and saline

   GROUP   XI.-Molybdenum,        Vanadium,   Tungsten—Tantalum.
    The members of this group are scarcely sufficiently well known
to warrant the propriety of their association being affirmed in an
 absolute manner.      Still with a very imperfect knowledge we are
 able to point out many analogies, but scarcely any discrepancy
of importance.      The sequence of atomic weights is very well
marked:—
               Mo       46.0         206.5
               w     = 635           *...* = 688.

               Sum     206'5          Mean difference   = 24  °
    The atomic weight of tantalum, or 184, is exactly double that of
tungsten. The four metals have, according to circumstances, a
white or grey colour; they are lustrous, brittle, and fuse with great
difficulty, if at all. The specific gravity of molybdenum is be
tween 7 and 8, that of tungsten about 17.5. The specific gravities
of vanadium and tantalum are undetermined.               Molybdenum
and tungsten have the same atomic volume, namely 69.            Molyb
 denum forms an unstable       protoxide  and  protosalts, vanadium a
protoxide but no protosalts; tungsten and tantalum, as far as is
 known, neither protoxides nor protosalts.          All the metals of
this group form binoxides, and with the exception of tantalum,
bisulphides and bichlorides, &c. All four binoxides are of a
black or brown colour.        Molybdenum and vanadium yield hy
 drated binoxides which are salifiable; that of molybdenum is
even slightly soluble in water.     The binoxide of vanadium unites

                             of   the Elements.                        491
with alkalies, forming vanadites.   All four metals form teroxides,
which are  undecomposable    by  heat alone.  The teroxide of mo
lybdenum is white or yellowish white, but when fused is of a
brownish yellow; that of vanadium is yellowish red; that of
tungsten, canary yellow, but occasionally white; that of tan
talum white when cold, yellow when hot. The teroxide of
molybdenum is volatile, fusible, and slightly soluble in water,
forming an acid solution; that of vanadium is fixed, fusible,
and soluble in water, though to a still less extent.      The ter
oxides of tungsten and tantalum are fixed, infusible, and after
ignition, insoluble. The hydrated teroxides of tungsten and
tantalum, when moistened with water, exert a faintly acid reaction
upon litmus paper, and are therefore somewhat soluble. Cor
responding molybdates, vanadiates and tungstates are isomor
phous; tantalic is isomorphous with tungstic acid, tantalite with
wolfram. Molybdic and tungstic acids have the same atomic vo
lume, namely 261. The molybdates are colourless or yellow; the
vanadiates more frequently yellow than colourless; the tung
states and tantalates colourless.    The four acids are evidently
bibasic, and the salts with two atoms of fixed base are permanent
at a red heat.    Intermediate between the binoxide and teroxide
of each of the first three metals, are several other oxides, remark
able for the variety of their colours,    indeed the teroxides and
their salts are the least coloured compounds to which the mem
bers of this group give origin.     Each metal forms a tersulphide,
having the properties of a sulphur acid, and forming definite
sulphur salts, as does also the bisulphide of vanadium. The
terchlorides of the four metals are volatile, and present great
analogy both of composition and properties. Tantalum probably
presents a relation of parity with niobium and pelopium.        This
group is associated with the ferric group by the isomorphism of
the chromates with the molybdates.          Chromium, however, differs
from the members of this group in              most characteristic pro
                                                its

                                            not forming bisalts, and    in
the characters  of   its acid, more particularly       as
                                                      regards    its
                                                                   solu

                                                heat.
   The acids   of   this group present some analogy         ofproperties
with the  silicic, titanic,  and stannic acids. Tantalates are gene
rally found native   in  association with titanates.
   Moreover, tellurium and antimony,              as
                                                 representatives   ofthe
second and third      groups,  are associated with this  group   bysome
general resemblances.        Certain sulphates are isomorphous with
corresponding molybdates.

those    presented     in other groups, though the circumstance of
the differences not being always gradational, throws some little
doubt upon the subject.          The sequence of the atomic weights is

    The specific heat of silver is double that of mercury and lead.
 The three metals are readily fusible, mercury at — 40°C., lead
 at 320°C., silver at 1000°C.            All three metals are capable of
 volatilization,—mercury most readily, then lead, then silver. All
 three metals crystallize in octahedra, are soft and malleable.
  Solid mercury, like lead, is capable of being cut with a knife.
 All three metals form protoxides and protosalts. The oxide of
 mercury has a brick-red or orange-yellow colour, the oxide of lead
 is pale yellow or dull red, the oxide of silver is brown. All three
 become much darker by heating. The oxygen in each oxide has
 the same atomic volume, although Kopp assigns a volume to the

All three oxides yield a regulus with great facility. We should
anticipate that the oxides and salts of silver would decompose
most readily, then those of lead, then those of mercury. Taking
all the reactions into consideration, however,        appears that                  it

   The propriety of associating gold with the platinum group is
very questionable. Palladium appears to present a relation of
parity with rhodium and ruthenium,-platinum with iridium
and possibly with osmium, though indeed many osmic reactions
are altogether special.    The double chlorides of platinum,                                            iri
dium, and osmium are isomorphous.
   The atomic weight of palladium, or 532, is rather more than
half that of platinum, or 98.6; or the two metals may be looked
upon as members of an uncompleted triad, the increment of
atomic weight being 45'4,            -
   Palladium and platinum are both white, hard, ductile, tena
cious, scarcely fusible, and very unoxidizable metals,     They both
crystallize in octahedra.     The two    protoxides are of a black
colour; the two binoxides are brownish, substances which dis
solve in alkaline solutions forming ill-defined salts.
   The sulphides and chlorides are analogous. Each of the                                                 bi
chlorides becomes converted into a protochloride at a tempera
ture considerably below the boiling-point of mercury.           Each
metal gives rise to numerous analogous double chlorides, with
the chlorides of ammonium and the basylous metals, &c. The
platinum bases are very numerous, but several corresponding
palladium bases have been also obtained. Platinum and palla
dium have the same atomic volume, 57, and sensibly the same
atomic heat, namely 3:15 and 3:19.
   Gold differs from the other two members of this group in
 itscolour, softness and fusibility.   The protoxide and protochlo
ride     gold correspond with the proto-compounds
        of                                                 palladium                    of

minations           of
               the nitrogen contained       this water were rather  in
uncertain, but the Commission thought itself fully justified                                                    in
concluding, that the free nitrogen       atmospheric air was assi

     That      plants could          nitrogen from nitrates, was
                                           assimilate
shown       by
            the success with which the use       nitrate    soda             of                 of             in
manure has been attended.      Liebigk believed that the nitrogen
of nitric acid, like the carbon     carbonic, and the sulphur                                                  of
                                                        a of
sulphuric acid, could become        constituent       the vegetable                of
organism.     Salm-Horstmar arrived        the conclusion, that  at                                            in
the development        plants the alkaline nitrates could replace
                                 of
ammonia.      Kuhlmann thought that the nitrates were first re
duced     to
          ammonia                 by
                        the deoxidizing influence      decomposing                  of
organic substances.     George Wilson was         opinion that the           of

                            the reducing action      the plants                    of                          on

the nitrate, even from the beginning, is exerted even without the
presence of decaying organic substances.
   He found that plants developed under the influence of nitrate
of potash grew more rapidly, reached a greater height, weighed
more, and exhibited a greater absorption of nitrogen, than such
as grew without the addition of that salt.    Similar conclusions
were obtained from      experiments in which Boussingault grew
cress with and without the addition of nitrate of soda.
   He is of opinion that nitrates act upon vegetation as energeti
cally          as,
          and even more      than ammoniacal salts. He discusses
                                                 so

quantity             of

of the same water contains from 6 to 7 grms. of nitre, corre
sponding to            l'l
                grim. of ammonia.
  Although river- and spring-water contain more nitrates than
ammonia, the contrary is the case with rain-water, snow and dew.
Boussingault's experiments on a large number of specimens of
rain-water collected in the middle of a field in the neighbour
hood of extensive - forests, yielded much less of nitrates than
ammonia.
   Pelouze showed that nitre slowly disappears in a solution of
white of egg, and the acid is changed into ammonia. This ex
plains why only traces of nitrates are found in liquid ammonia.
According to Boussingault, mere traces of nitre are found at the

nitrogen than was originally contained           the seeds and the nitre     in

the free nitrogen                 of
                       the atmosphere had been assimilated.        Plants

  M. G. Wille     on the influence      of Nitrates   on Vegetation.          501
mitrate, even in cases in which nitrogenized organic matter, such
as beam-meal or gelatine, was added to the sand.       The excess of
nitrogen could not therefore have arisen from a nitrification;
nor could it have proceeded from an absorption of ammonia, for
if it had been so, why was it not also absorbed when the smaller
quantity of nitre was employed       Ville considers that nitrogen
is absorbed  by plants  in three forms: as free nitrogen, as am
monia, and as nitrate; and is of opinion that the assimilation of
an element may take place by the most contrary reactions.
    In the third part of his research, Wille seeks to establish that
the nature of the products formed during the decomposition of
manures, shows that plants absorb the gaseous nitrogen of the
atmosphere.     The method of his experiments was as follows:—
To a  pot filled with calcined sand, a certain quantity of bean
meal was added.     This pot was placed in a stoneware basin con
taining water, and the whole covered with a bell-jar.       Every
day 500 litres of air, carefully freed from any other nitrogenous
compound than nitrogen, was passed through.       The air passing
from the bell-jar bubbled through a bulb containing weak
hydrochloric acid. By the action of the external temperature
water evaporated, and condensed on the interior surface of the
bell-jar.   At intervals this was collected and evaporated to dry.
ness with oxalic acid; the hydrochloric acid in the bulb was
also treated in the same way.         In these was contained the
nitrogen which had passed off as ammonia.        Wille found, that of
0.238   grim. nitrogen added to the sand in the form of nitrogenous
matter, 0.093 grim. remained behind, 0.058 grm. passed off as
ammonia, and 0.087 grim. was lost in an indeterminate manner.
As no mitrate had been formed, he concluded that it had passed
off as free nitrogen.
   In another series of experiments, wheat was sown in calcined
sand to which bean-meal had been added.      At the expiration of
the  experiment, the quantity  of nitrogen contained in the pro
duce was estimated.     As it was found to be greater than the
quantity furnished by the seed and by the ammonia formed in
the decomposition of the bean-meal, it was concluded that it was
derived from the direct absorption of gaseous nitrogen.
   His general conclusions are, that every organic substance in
decomposing loses a portion of           its
                                   nitrogen     gaseous nitrogen;
                                                        as
that the progress     of
                     this decomposition     not altered
                                                  is       vegeta        by
tion; that plants grown       manured soil absorb more nitrogen
                                byin
                                  a

than would      be
             furnished     the ammonia formed                          the manure;
and that the excess        of
                       this has been absorbed                          the gaseous
state.
   His previous researches had led him                 to   affirm that plants
absorb   a   certain quantity    of    nitrogen which   is    not accounted for

502           M. Reiset       on the Phaenomena              of Putrefaction.
by the ammonia of the atmosphere.       He now goes further, and
shows that this is absorbed as  gaseous  nitrogen.
   These experiments of Ville confirm the results arrived at by
Reisetº some time before, on the phaenomena of putrefaction.
Reiset's experiments were made with the apparatus used by
himself and Regnault in their experiments on the respiration of
animals. This apparatus consists essentially of a large glass
bell-jar, in which are placed the substances experimented upon,
of an arrangement for absorbing carbonic acid, and an arrange
ment for supplying oxygen.      In proportion as the carbonic acid
is absorbed, a quantity of oxygen exactly equal to it passes in.
It will be seen, that if in the decomposition of any nitrogenous
organic substance oxygen alone is absorbed, and carbonic acid
alone produced, the air in the bell-jar at the conclusion of the
experiment will have the composition of normal atmospheric air.
If,   on the contrary, nitrogen has been produced, the relation
between the nitrogen and oxygen will         different from that  be                                  of
common      air, and  eudiometric
                           a        analysis will show how much
nitrogen has been produced. By means             the apparatus, the    of
temperature and pressure can           regulated, that
                                                   be   so the com                     at

                                  the experiment these conditions
are the same.
   Reiset's experiments              were       made         with manures      various of
kinds, and with flesh.                   His results are             follow :—Organic

substances         in   decomposing        absorb        a    large quantity   oxygen   of
and produce carbonic acid, and the relation between these can
be  accurately determined. The formation                  manure and theof

                  flesh are  always    accompanied          the production   by

        On the Production    of Carbonic Acid from Manures.     503
tity of carbonic acid produced could be estimated. This consisted
of a large bell-jar fitted with a cork, and cemented down to a
glass plate so that it could be made quite air-tight.     The cork
had two tubes, through one of which air freed from carbonic acid
by bubbling through potash and carbonic acid, passed; the other
tube communicated with two vessels containing baryta-water to
absorb the carbonic acid produced, and with the aspirator, by
means of which air was drawn through the apparatus. The ex
periments were made by placing the substances under the bell
jar, making it air-tight, and then drawing air through at the rate
 of about five gallons in six hours. The experiments generally
lasted twenty-four hours, and at the expiration of that time the
 carbonate of baryta was collected and weighed.
    In one experiment, a flower-pot containing garden-mould which
 had not been manured for a long time, was placed, and the
aspirator set in motion. After twenty-four hours the carbonate
of baryta was collected and weighed.        The layer of mould was
about 18 inches square and 3 inches deep, and the quantity of
carbonic acid produced was such as to show that a hectare of
land (about 24 acres) would produce in the course of twenty-four
hours 500 hectolitres (or about 11,000 gallons) of carbonic acid.
A similar experiment with a more clayey soil gave 300 hecto
litres of carbonic acid for a hectare of land. The same soil turned
up with a knife, so as to imitate the effect of ploughing, gave a
quantity of 400 hectolitres for the hectare.
    An experiment was made with soil taken from a field of beet
root, which had had farm-yard manure in winter, and colza tops
in March. The experiment lasted four days, at a temperature
varying from 20 or 25 to 30 or 35 degrees, but it did not
appear that the temperature had much influence on the result.
It was found that the quantity of gas gradually decreased from
day to day: the mean result corresponded to a quantity of 1570
hectolitres per hectare, or about 13,800 gallons per acre.
    These results prove that a very large quantity of carbonic acid
is  produced  in a field cultivated and well manured, and that the
mass of this gas is assimilated directly by the leaves of plants,
for it is not conceivable otherwise how there could be such a
small proportion in the air.
    Corenwinder also made a series of experiments with manure.
He found that a layer of fresh cow-dung exposed, under the con
ditions indicated, at a temperature of about 20°, gave a quantity
of carbonic acid equal to 1240 hectolitres per hectare.        Cow.
dung kept four days, which was in a state of change, and then
submitted to experiment, gave in twenty-four hours carbonic acid
at the rate of 2000 hectolitres per hectare, or 17,600 gallons
per acre. At a temperature of 20°, fresh horse-dung gave results

504 Boussingault on              the Composition            of the Water of the Dead Sea.
corresponding   to 500 hectolitres per hectare. But the same
substance which had entered into fermentation gave in six hours
results corresponding to the enormous quantity of 8800 hecto
litres per hectare in the twenty-four hours, or 77,440 gallons
per acre.
  Experiments were made also with various organic substances:
sugar as well as wood-charcoal moistened gave no carbonic acid,
and guano only a small quantity; linseed-meal produced a con
siderable quantity of carbonic acid.
   It is generally assumed that the carbonic acid absorbed by
plants is almost entirely derived from the respiration of animals,
and a balance between these two kingdoms has been established
which must be considered too absolute if we take into account
the enormous quantity of carbonic acid assimilated every year by
plants. These experiments show, Corenwinder thinks, that it is
more conformable to nature to ascribe to the carbonic acid pro
duced at the surface of the soil the greater part of the alimenta
tion of vegetables.
   Boussingault.* has examined the water of the Dead Sea. His
principal object was to ascertain if nitrates were contained in                                          it,
as  these had not been found                      by
                                         Gmelin. Boussingault thinks
that nitrates have frequently been stated                             be

    T is well known that the eight circles, each of which touches
      three given circles, are determined as follows:—viz. consi
dering any one in particular of the four axes of similitude of the
given circles, and the perpendicular                              let
                                                  fall from the radical
centre (or centre            of
                       the orthotomic circle)         the given circles,   of
there are two      the required tangent circles which have their
                    of
centres upon the perpendicular, and pass through the points                                                  of
intersection       of
                 the orthotomic circle and the axis           similitude,               of
or   inother words,  the axis     similitude of       common chord    is   a                             or

This suggests the choice       the radical centre for the origin

coordinates; and the resulting formulae then take very simple
forms, and the theorem        verified without difficulty.
   Take then the centre             of is

LXVIII.        Notes          on Mineralogy.—No.                      V.   On Hypostilbite and
   Stilbite.  By the Rev. SAMUEL HAUGHToN, M.A., Fellow of
   Trinity College, and Professor of Geology in the University of
  Dublin’k.                                                                                  -

IN the twelfth volume of the
   an analysis is published of a mineral         allied to stilbite, by
Mr.   J. W.    Mallet, and labelled hypostilbite by the person from
whom he received it.
   In the same volume, p. 552, this mineral is pronounced to be
Laumonite by Dr. Heddle, who disposes of the label hypostilbite
by means of the hypothesis, that “the christening may be ex
plained by the ignorance of some unprincipled dealer resorting
to a rare title in order to get rid of a superabundance of an                                           in
significant-looking substance.”
   From the description given by Mr. Mallet and Dr. Heddle of
the mineral,        I
                 have no doubt of      being the same      itsmineral

    This analysis agrees with Beudant’s and my own, except as to
 the quantity of water present, and I think it would be very diffi
 cult to make a satisfactory mineralogical formula from any of the
 analyses.     Hypostilbite is not well established as a distinct mi
 neral, and should be considered as an altered form of stilbite.
    I shall  conclude this note by adding an analysis of some fine
 crystals of stilbite from the Nerbudda Valley, Hindostan, recently
 sent home by Mr. Jacob, C.E.

    This leads to the well-known formula for stilbite, which may
 be considered as a Hydrated Lime Orthoclase,
                   CaO, SiO3+Al2O3, 3SiO3+6HO.
 If we are to consider hypostilbite as a distinct mineral, it should
 be regarded as a Hydrated Lime Oligoclase, with the formula
                   CaO, SiO2+A1*0°, 2SiO3+5HO.

THE     “On the Aurora.” By Reuben Phillips, Esq.
     In this paper the author enters into various speculations as to
 the formation and motion of auroral arches. Since it has been found
 by experiment that the maximum length of the voltaic arc with a
 given battery is nearly the same in atmospheric                     and      highly        air             in
 rarefied air, forming          very perfect vacuum, the author conceives

 moderate length, (the maximum length very nearly                        continuous              of   a
 discharge,) which starts upwards from the auroral arch, which                                                           he

   “Chemical Examination of Burmese Naphtha, or Rangoon Tar.”
 By Warren De la Rue, Ph.D., F.R.S., and Hugo Müller, Ph.D.”
   In several localities of the kingdom of Burmah, there emanates
 from the soil in considerable quantity a peculiar oleaginous substance,
 which is employed for a variety of purposes, but chiefly as a lamp
 fuel and as an unguent, by the natives, and exported in moderate
 quantities under the name of Burmese naphtha, or Rangoon tar.
    It is obtained by sinking wells of about 60 feet in depth, in which
 the liquid is collected by the miner as it oozes from the soil.
    At the common temperature this substance has the consistence of
 goose-fat; it is lighter than water, has usually a greenish-brown
 colour, and possesses a slight odour, peculiar, but not disagreeable.
 It consists almost entirely of volatile constituents.
    Burmese naphtha has already attracted the attention of other
 chemists; at present we refrain from entering into a discussion of
 their results, since it is our intention to give a full history of this
 remarkable natural product when, after the completion of our expe
 riments, we shall have the honour of submitting to the Royal Society
 a detailed account of our investigation.            The object of the present
 communication is to trace a mere outline of the results at which we
have arrived up to this moment.
    The circumstances under which petroleum—for this is the col
lective term which comprehends a great variety of oily emanations
 similar to Burmese naphtha—occurs in nature,                tend              all

pipes the temperature of which could be regulated. Treated in this
way, it furnishes 96 per cent. of volatile products, fluid and solid.
   Steam of 100° C. (212°F.) carries over 11 per cent. of a volatile
oil perfectly free from solid hydrocarbons, which at that tempera
ture are entirely retained in the distillatory apparatus. Between the
temperatures of 110° and 145° C. (230°–293°F.), 10 per cent. of a
further distillate is obtained, which is almost free from solid hydro
carbons. The temperature may be raised to 160° C. (320° F.)
without materially augmenting this per-centage; but on gradually
increasing the temperature of the steam to the fusion-point of lead,
the operation yields 20 additional per cent. of distillate, which retains

obtained by means of strong nitric acid are fluids at the lower end of
the series, whilst with hydrocarbons boiling above 200°C. (392. F.)
they are of a resinous consistence; they frequently retain with obsti
macy a portion of the not-acted-upon hydrocarbons, and more espe
cially if the experiment be conducted upon a small scale; nitro
compounds are sometimes obtained which float upon water, in con
sequence of this retention of the lighter hydrocarbons.
    In submitting the hydrocarbons to the action of the acids, we have
invariably selected fluids which from their boiling-points appeared to
be within certain limits homogeneous; but notwithstanding every pos
sible care in this selection, we have always obtained more than one
 sulpho-acid and more than one nitro-compound, as the case might be,
 and we have experienced very considerable difficulties in the separa
 tion of the mixed products.      In the case of nitro-compounds, advan
 tage has sometimes been taken of their convertibility by a mixture
 of sulphuric and nitric acids into                  di-
                                          and tri-nitro-compounds, which
 admitted      of
               fractional crystallization from various media.   We have
 been thus enabled      isolate the following compounds, the analysis and
                                to

     IIydrocarbons       not acted upon by Sulphuric and Nitric Acids.
    The hydrocarbons which resist, the action of monohydrated sul
 phuric and nitric acids form, as has been before stated, by far the
 larger portion of the distillates obtained from Burmese naphtha.
 When purified by washing from adhering acid, by fractional distilla
 tion, and finally by rectification in a current of dry hydrogen gas over
 the liquid alloy of potassium and sodium, they are obtained almost
 inodorous and perfectly colourless. . Thus purified, they are very
 fluid, and retain their fluidity even in the intense cold produced by
 a mixture of solid carbonic acid and ether.           No absolute fixity of
 boiling-point could be obtained in any of the products; nevertheless
 a much greater constancy in this respect was observed than with the
hydrocarbons before treatment with strong acids. The lowest boiling
point obtained was 50° C. (122°F.); the highest, being far beyond
the range of the mercurial thermometer, was not ascertained. The
 specific heat of the vapour of                    all

   “Photo-chemical Researches.—Part I. On the Measurement of
the Chemical Action of Light.” By Professor Bunsen of Heidel
berg, and Henry Enfield Roscoe, B.A., Ph.D.
   The only instrument which has been applied to the measurement
of the chemical action of light was proposed in 1843 by Dr. Draper
of New York. The sensitive substance employed by him was a
mixture of chlorine and hydrogen, and by measuring the diminution
ensuing on exposure       to light, he experimentally determined some
important relations of photo-chemical action.           Draper's instrument
is,  however, not adapted for accurate measurements, owing,                  the                                  in

and,      the second place, that the statical equilibrium, which must
            in
exist between the free and dissolved gases,           order that the free gas   in
should consist             of
                     equal volumes       chlorine and hydrogen, was never

he was repairing the vessel yielded only 0 oz. 18 dwts. to the ton.
I was enabled by the courtesy of the captain of the ‘Nina,’ a brig
which had just arrived in the Pacific from England, to obtain more
satisfactory information.    He gave me a piece of Muntz's yellow
metal from his    cabin, from the same lot with which the brig was
sheathed, but which had never been in contact with salt water; and
also a small portion from the hull of the ship after it had been on
nearly three years. The experiments were performed as before, and
the results were very striking.

That which had             been exposed to the sea having nearly eight times as
much silver as the original sample.
    Many other specimens were examined of metals from the bottoms
of ships, and of pieces which are always kept on board in case of
need, and it was invariably found that the former contained more
silver than the latter.       For instance, a piece from the hull of the
‘Bergmann” gave 5 ozs. 16 dwts. 18 grs. per ton, while that from
the cabin yielded 4 ozs. 6 dwts. 12 grs.           200 grs. from a piece from
the hull of the      ‘Parga’   gave  '072   gr., and a piece of fresh metal
*050; while from the ‘Grasmere,' only coppered a few months,
610 grs. from the hull gave '075 and from the cabin '072,-a very
slight difference indeed.
    It will be observed that the amount of silver in the above specimens
of fresh metal is very high, and it is probable that most of these are
merely the re-rolling of masses of metal melted down from old
sheathing, and have derived the greater part of their silver from the
sea on former occasions. It is well known that the copper used in the
manufacture of yellow metal is very pure, containing 2 or 3 dwts. of
silver per ton, frequently not so much, and silver is very seldom asso
ciated with the other constituent, zinc.          In order to arrive at more
certain    results, however,     have      I
                                         granulated   some very pure copper,

Theodor Kjerulf, and those of the Baltic Provinces of Russia, by Prof.

  M. Kjerulf of Christiania, having communicated to the author
descriptive letters and illustrative diagrams of the relations and di
mensions of the different strata of the Silurian rocks of the territory
of Christiania, as well as a series of their organic remains,—and Count
Keyserling having forwarded to him a memoir by Prof. F. Schmidt,
of Dorpat, comprising the results of an examination of the Silurian
rocks of the territory of Esthonia, Northern Livonia, and the Isle of
Oesel,-Sir Roderick in this paper brought an outline of these docu
ments under the consideration of the Society, in order to show how
independent observers in other tracts have come to the conclusion
that the Silurian System as defined by them, as well as by himself,
forms a natural-history group, both as to                            its
                                                  geological relations and
its  zoological  contents.    He    pointed   out also that the Silurian
rocks      Russia and Scandinavia agree with those
            of                                                Britain from            of

    M. Kjerulf divides the whole Silurian series          his country into       of

 Southern Livonia.      With but partial exceptions the Silurian series
 of Esthonia is almost entirely composed of calcareous bands.
    The “Pleta,” or the oldest and most northern group of the se
 ries, caps the cliffs of the Gulf of Bothnia, which are known as the
 “Glint,” and is based on the Ungulite grit and associated argilla
 ceous and sandy beds of the government of St. Petersburg.          It is
of the age of the Llandeilo rocks, and is succeeded by coralline lime
 stones of the Caradoc or Bala age.      The next series of strata com
prise two bands of Pentameri (P. borealis and P. oblongus), representing
the Llandovery series.      The succeeding group is developed partly
on the continent and partly on the north-eastern portion of the Isle
 of Oesel, and chiefly consists of dolomites of the Wenlock age.       In
 the south-western portion of the island are still higher strata of the
 Ludlow series, in which fish-remains are not unfrequent.
    In comparing these Scandinavian, Esthonian, and British Silurian
 rocks together, Sir Roderick particularly dwelt upon—1. the natural
indivisibility of the alum-schists and Lingula-flags from the rest of
 the Lower Silurian series; 2. the extensive occurrence of the Pen
tamerus-zone, marking the passage-beds between the Upper and
Lower members of the series; 3. the general uniformity in the
distribution of the organic remains of the several successional groups
of beds, although the strata themselves are very variously developed,
as to mineral character and thickness;        and 4. the characteristic
agreement in fossils between the several Silurian areas of Northern
Europe, North America, Canada, and the Arctic regions, on the one
hand; whilst, on the other, the Silurian rocks of France, Spain,
Bohemia, the Ural, and probably of South America, are dissimilar
as a group, from their northern representatives, both in palaeonto
logical and lithological characters, marking the existence of distinct
geographical limits of life during the older palaeozoic period.
    In conclusion, the author stated that all the evidence tended to
prove that in Scandinavia, as in Russia in Europe, the Silurian rocks,
both Lower and Upper, form a united and unbroken whole; and
that, both by fossils and by strata, they exhibit in those countries,
and in a very small compass, a natural-history system quite as com
plete and more easily understood than their much more expanded,
highly varied, and dislocated equivalents in the British Isles.

    The subject of this paper was a considerable portion of the ske
leton of a small quadruped, about the size of a fox, imbedded in, and
apparently the nucleus of, one of the septarian nodules of the
London clay, which are dredged up at the mouth of the Thames
for the purpose of the manufacture of Roman cement.
    From this module were extricated the skull with the entire series
of teeth in both jaws, the right humerus, portions of the pelvis,

short transverse bar—the rudiment of the middle tubercle in the
preceding tooth.       In Coryphodon the sinking of the middle of each
transverse  ridge  seems a step towards the more complete bifurcation
of the  ridge in  Pliolophus.
   The mandible and lower molar teeth of the Hyracotherium are
unknown ; but, in regard to the upper molars, Pliolophus approaches
Hyracotherium in the characters by which it deviates from other
Lophiodonts.
   The differences in the dentition, and in the part of the skull of
the Hyracotherium which can be compared, between that genus and
Pliolophus were pointed out in detail; but the degree of resemblance
is such as to lead the author to adopt the idea, first broached by the
late Mr. W. H. Turner*, that Hyracotherium is more nearly or
essentially allied to Lophiodon than to Charopotamus. The third
trochanter on the femur of Pliolophus, and the association of three
metatarsals in one portion of the matrix, as if belonging to the same
hind foot, confirm the essentially perissodactyle affinities of that genus
as shown by the skull and teeth.            Pliolophus and Hyracotherium
form, in the author's opinion, a well-marked section in the Lophiodont
family, which seems to have preceded the Palaeotherian family in the
order of appearance, and to have retained more of the general ungulate
type than that family. This is shown by the graduation of the tapiroid
modification of the molar teeth into one more nearly resembling that
of the Anthracotheria and Charopotami; by the absence of the
postero-internal cone on the ultimate premolar, by which                   the                        all
premolars are,          Artiodactyles, less complex than the true molars;
                         as   in
 by the form and position                  of
                                 the nasal bones and the structure         the                         of

 first approximation, which must be perfected by a more profound
study and a more perfect knowledge of the phaenomena.
    I have commenced the study of the physical properties of bodies
 with the velocity of sound, which is a function of several other pro
perties which must correspond to it if the mathematical laws are
 correct, or which must modify those laws in whatever respect they
are incorrect.
    I determined the velocity of sound in solids by causing very fine
and long wires to vibrate longitudinally; I diminished the diameters
until the sound remained invariable.       My wires were only from
Tººths to ºths of a millimetre in diameter, and 1:50 metre in length.
I placed them horizontally above a beam of oak, and fixed their ex
tremities between two strong brass vices.
    The wires were very homogeneous, and the harmonics exactly
followed the laws of Bernoulli. The elevation of the sounds was
given by a sonometer, of which the brass cord was very fine and
very homogeneous.
    The following formulae give the velocity of sound as a function of
the other physical elements:—

      rizontal tubes may be employed by means of a stopcock with three
      branches, to produce a vacuum in the apparatus and fill it with gas;
      to the other metal tube, which is also furnished with a safety
      stopcock, a curved glass tube dipping into the mercurial trough is
      adapted. By means of this arrangement the pressure of the gas
      may be ascertained, or it may be collected for analysis. With gases,
      the apparatus, with the exception of the bellows, is immersed in a
      trough full of water, and with vapours, the whole apparatus, inclu
      ding the bellows, is placed in a large zinc stove, where it is heated
      by the vapour of boiling water.    For operating under low pressures,
      the bellows is surrounded    by a  box  in which a counter pressure is
      established. This box and the rod of the bellows are then united
      by a caoutchouc tube, the elasticity of which leaves the rod sufficient
      plaw.
           .a new apparatus with which I have not yet experimented, I
      have placed the bellows in the neck of the balloon, in order to avoid
      opposite pressures.
         The apparatus being filled with gas or vapours, the sound is pro
      duced very pure, and as often as may be desired, by the action of
      the bellows; the harmonics issue readily, and it is necessary to take
                                          --
      several in order to be certain of the fundamental sound.

                                 gases, the specific heat at a constant

 are composed, or by a simple fraction of this number.
    7. For each simple or compound body there exists a ponderable
 molecule, the mass of which is always in simple proportion to the
 chemical equivalent, and which possesses the power of producing
 the same mechanical work when it is solicited by the same force or
 by the same quantity of heat. We shall give it the name of mecha
 nical equivalent.  The mass of this molecule will be that which must
 be taken as unity in problems of chemical dynamics.

have only complained that Dr. Noad should have suppressed my
inventions             on
                that occasion, knowing that they had been made

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous   Articles.            537
 upwards of twelve months before, and had been confided to him for
publication more than six months previously, particularly when, on
hearing that he was going to lecture, I reminded him of the position
 in which he had placed me, and requested that he would do me the
justice to allude to my improvements at the same time. Why this
request was denied to one to whom Dr. Noad had professed so much
 friendship, I cannot understand.
     With regard to our respective claims to priority, I can only say
 that my machine was finished six months before the time when Mr.
 Bentley states that he commenced his; and I had also worked out
 most of the results contained in my communications to the Philo
 sophical Magazine long before that period.    It is a remarkable cir
 cumstance that there is no part in Mr. Bentley's arrangement which
 did not previously exist in mine.
                 I have the honour to remain, Gentlemen,
                           Your obedient Servant,

            ACTION OF NITRIC ACID UPON GLYCERINE.
   Dr. Debus has succeeded in obtaining from glycerine and nitric
acid, besides two or three other compounds, an acid belonging to
the propyle series, and homologous to glyoxylic acid. The detail of
this investigation will be published in a future Number of this
Journal.
    ANALYSES OF THE SULPHATO-CARBONATE OF BARYTES OF
                THOMSON.   BY DR. HEDDLE.
   I believe it to be pretty generally understood among mineralogists,
that the sulphato-carbonate of barytes of Thomson is merely the
carbonate encrusted more or less with minute crystals of the sul
phate: two analyses which I have lately made confirm this view.
   a. From Dufton; b. from Hexham (portions of crystals upwards
of 4 inches in diameter).
