                          United States, persons receiving copies should make
                          appropriate efforts to determine the copyright status
                          of the work in their country and use the work accordingly.
                          It is possible that current copyright holders, heirs or
                          the estate of the authors of individual portions of the
                          work, such as illustrations or photographs, assert copyrights
                          over these portions. Depending on the nature of subsequent
                          use that is made, additional rights may need to be obtained
                          independently of anything we can address. The digital

 I.   On the Gold-workings formerly conducted in the County of
     Wicklow, Ireland.     By Thomas WEAver, Esq., F.R.S.
    F.G.S. M.R.I.A. &c. &c.”
     INCE    my return to Europe, after an absence of nearly
      three years, among the scientific publications that have
attracted my attention, the Journal of the Geological Society
of Dublin claimed particular notice.         I rejoiced to perceive a
growing spirit of geological inquiry in Ireland, and more espe
cially as that spirit is understood to have been mainly excited
and promoted by the Trigonometrical Survey of the island now
in progress under the able conduct of Colonel Colby, R.E.
    It was, however, with surprise and regret that I read the
nual Meeting    º
following passage in the Address delivered at the First
                   that Society by their President. Speaking of
                                                                 An
the natural resources of Ireland, the learned author says:
“Even native gold was found not many years ago in a neigh
bouring county in large wedges.            It was discovered in a
limited portion of a stream of about one hundred yards in
extent; and though the stream was repeatedly examined up
to the mountain from which it descended, not a trace of the
metal could be perceived in any other part; yet, notwith
standing this circumstance, the mountain itself was presumed
to be the chief depository: it was accordingly perforated quite
through, with great labour and at an enormous expense; and
the search conducted in this way having proved unsuccessful,

2              Mr. Weaver                on the Gold-workings
was finally abandoned.      The limited portion of the stream in
which any gold could be discovered, we might suppose, should
have directed to the adjacent banks, and the hills which rise
from the spot on either side.       These might have been ex
plored at much less expense; and judging by the uncom
monly great size of some of the lumps which had been found,
it seems not unreasonable to expect, notwithstanding the past
disappointment, that much will hereafter be brought to light.”
    A judgment thus gravely pronounced from a presidential
chair demands attention.       From what source the deliverer of
that sentence drew his information does not appear; yet cer
tainly a more strange misapprehension of facts has seldom
been embodied in words. In justice to the Government under
whose auspices I had the honour to act, as well as to the
 memories of the individuals concerned in directing the opera
 tions (of whom I am the only survivor), it becomes incumbent
on me to disabuse the public by recalling their attention to
the real circumstances of the case; and this       might briefly     I
do by a simple reference to the succinct and faithful history
I   have given of the proceedings in my memoir on the East of
 Ireland, published in the 5th volume of the Geological Trans
 actions, First Series. But as those Transactions are, compara
 tively speaking, in the hands of few persons, it appears expe
dient to enter into some details, through the medium of a
scientific Journal of extensive circulation; for which purpose
I  subjoin the following extracts from my memoir on the East
of Ireland, merely transposing a few passages for the sake of
greater distinctness".
    “$$ 105. 106. The discovery of native gold in the Ballin
valley stream at Croghan Kinshella mountain was accidental;
and, as it subsequently proved, the principal depôt of the gold
in that stream extended about twelve hundred yards below
the ford.    In other quarters the gold obtained was compara
tively of small amount.       The largest piece found in any of
the other streams was on the Coolbawn side.          It weighed
24 ounces. But in                  all
                          these cases the gold was accompanied
 by  most    of

valley stream, and which will                 be

    “3. The ascertained fact that several of the contemporaneous
veins of quartz, contained in the mountain, were metalliferous,
yielding magnetic ironstone, iron pyrites, copper pyrites,
 blende and iron ochre, with chlorite and quartz crystals.
    “Under these considerations, the measures proposed by the
directors were: to continue the stream-works, progressively
advancing toward the head of the several streams; to examine
more closely the solid mass of the mountain, by means of
trenches to be cut in various directions down to the firm rock;
to explore more fully the veins already known, and those
which might be discovered near the surface by the trenches;
and lastly, to try these veins, at a considerable depth from the
surface, by means of a gallery or level, to be driven into the
mountain, in a direction nearly at right angles with the ge
neral range of the veins, selecting that quarter where they ap
peared to be most numerous.
    “These measures receiving the sanction of Government,they
were carried into effect; and numerous trials were made by
driving and sinking on the veins previously known and
subsequently discovered.           By the Ballinvalley trench alone
twenty-seven veins of quartz were found, varying from nine
inches to four feet      ºil.   in a distance of 700 fathoms; and
in the same manner, by the Ballinagore trench, eighteen
quartz veins were discovered in a distance of 600 fathoms.
These veins partly range and dip with the slaty rock, but they
also ramify and terminate in strings which intersect the latter.
They are evidently contemporaneous, and most of them are
§.
barren, but some were found bearing magnetic ironstone, iron
          and iron ochre, with chlorite. Two of the most power
  ul veins occur on the western side of the northern arm of the
mountain, one being six feet wide in the broadest part, and
the other four feet. They consist principally of massive mag
netic ironstone and quartz, with disseminated copper pyrites,
and iron pyrites.        A similar vein, four or five feet wide,
with the addition of blende, occurs near the extremity of the
northern arm, and another, two and a half feet wide, appears
in the face of the rock over the Daragh river.”             In the Geo
logical Map of Croghan Kinshela mountain *, it may be seen
that the level driven into the mountain, nearly at right angles

     “The  mineral substances obtained by these various opera
tions were subjected to experimental processes both by fire
and amalgamation; but in no instance was a particle of gold

unsatisfactory a result

                                to the persuasion, that the gold
formed no          of the veins which appear in the mountain;

prise.

fram, and manganese, in discovering which the mining opera

of the mountain, in Ballynacapogue brook, and small particles
of gold were obtained, with magnetic ironstone, magnetic
ironsand, and fragments of tinstone crystals. A third trial, in
Fannanerin stream, on the north-eastern flank of the moun
tain, did not produce any gold.”
    The preceding extracts may serve to show how untenable
are the positions advanced in the statement of the distinguished
President.    They prove,
    1. That the discovery of native gold was not confined to a
limited portion of a stream of about one hundred yards in
extent.
    2. That gold was found in other parts, and in other streams
proceeding from the same mountain; and indications to this
effect are given in the Map of Croghan Kinshela mountain.
    3. That the mountain was not perforated through, nor with
great labour, nor at an enormous expense. And the sole
object of a level, which was driven 178 fathoms long into the
mountain, was to try in depth veins found by trenching at the
surface. The moderate expense of such a level passing through
 a clayslate rock (and that rock dipping toward, and thus fa
 vouring the progress of the level,) any competent miner may
readily compute.
    4. That the adjacent banks and hills rising on either side
 were attended to ; for in fact the mountain was scarified by
 trenches on every side, cut down to the live rock; and many
veins were discovered in consequence, upon which workings
 were conducted, and the produce subjected to repeated ex
 periments.    These veins were thus explored at the least ex
   ense,

    With this plain statement of facts forbear comment, merely
 adding that I am persuaded that few, if any, Government
 undertakings have ever been conducted in a more oeconomical
 manner, or at so little charge to the public. The great ob
ject was to determine, according to the approved principles
 of practical miners, whether auriferous veins existed in the
 mountain; and the negative appearing to be proved, Govern
 ment were induced to relinquish the enterprise.     Prior to the
 operations of Government, my friends had joined me in a pro

 The result of the subsequent researches, however, gave us
 reason to be content that our offer had not been accepted by

   Introducing instead of the true anomaly and the smallest
distance, the radii vectores and the chord between, we obtain
the important advantage of exterminating the elements of the
parabola from the equation.    In applying the method of co
ordinates it is likewise more convenient to retain distances
only in the formula.    With this view put

study of language may, I conceive, be taken upon several distinct
             1st. It may be considered metaphysically, by which
   mean the consideration of language generally, as the means
of giving expression to the feelings and operations of the mind.
To this head might belong the question whether language is
coeval with the creation of man, or has been gradually worked
out by the development of his faculties, having nothing more
than the mere capability of utterance as the original material with
which to work. I confess that whilst it is impossible to doubt the
progressive development of language, I am inclined to unite
with those who admit the former proposition. The metaphy
sical philologist may nevertheless pursue his speculations and
inquire hypothetically into the mode in which language might
be progressively built up to satisfy the wants of man. With                                       ...

 conferred; but it is not in my power to engage your attention
 in this department. There is another, the 3rd, which I shall
 mention, which seems more associated with the studies of my
 own profession; this may be styled the physiological depart
 ment of philology. To this department belong the interesting
 researches respecting the production of the vowel sounds, the
 modification of the voice by the movements of the larynx and
 the cooperation of the tongue, teeth, lips, and nose. It is not,
 however, in this department that I propose seeking this even
 ing's occupation, yet I would remark in passing that there are
 certain modifications of language which it seems necessary to
 refer to this department, and which cannot fail to introduce a
 difficult complication, and even serious errors, if they are                                                 al

of precisely the same character.             An individual who exhibited
 this peculiarity asserted that his ear could detect no difference
 between Weal and Veal, Winegar and Vinegar.                       Whether
 this insensibility be general amongst those who have acquired
 this vulgar London peculiarity            I am not prepared to say, but
 I   have known a similar insensibility to exist where another
substitution of the same kind had taken place. In some parts
of Worcestershire and Herefordshire a striking error prevails
in the use of the aspirate; we hear it employed where it should
be suppressed, and it is suppressed where it should be em
ployed.      Although this is done so systematically that it seems
like the result of design and principle, yet, as I have just stated,
I   know that it may take place from a want of perception of the
difference existing between the two sounds". I heard a gen
tleman from that district say that he could not distinguish as
from has. I am unable to say how far changes of this kind
are to be attributed to a defective appreciation of the sounds
produced, but I believe there can be little doubt that such
changes are rather to be attributed to a want of aptitude in
the organ producing than in the organ perceiving the sound.
A cause of this latter kind operates to prevent many persons
from pronouncing the TH, to which, in consequence, they
        the power of    T   or of D. A similar difficulty occasions the
#.  to be  pronounced      like R, as, for example, “the Rong grories
of    majestic   Rome,”      for the Long glories, &c.          Children, in
learning to speak, often, transiently, exhibit difficulties of this
kind, which they for the most part speedily surmount, unless the
difficulty be very great, in which case it may become permanent.
     The commutation of one letter for another, as is exhibited
 in the declinable parts of speech, in the composition of com
 pound words, and also in the concurrence of words in a sen
 tence, of which there are so many striking examples in the
 Greek language, are doubtless to be referred to some physi
 cal cause which may sometimes be found in the greater facility
 of utterance, and at others in the more agreeable sound con
 veyed to the ear.          The manner of contraction from double
 vowels to diphthongs, and from long vowels to short, is to be
 referred to a similar cause, as being rather dependent on a
 physical cause than to be regarded as a peculiarity connected
 with a particular language.          The      contraction of OI into I in
  Greek seems to be quite analogous to the vulgar pronuncia
     * [An instance illustrative of this is within our own knowledge, in which
  a person  who was originally incapable of distinguishing between aspirated
  and unaspirated sounds, and who therefore uttered them indiscriminately,
  has gradually acquired both the pereeption and the right utterance of
  them.–EDIT.]

tion of pint and pison for point and poison. It is by no means
improbable that some of these peculiarities of pronunciation
and the predominance or suppression of certain sounds in par
ticular districts, although proceeding from physical causes, and
therefore to be regarded as distinct from those characters
which indicate connexion with a particular stock, may never
theless be characteristic of a particular race, the organic pe
culiarity prevailing, like those of colour, form of the head, ex
pression of countenance, stature, and the like, from hereditary
transmission.      That peculiar dialect of English spoken by
negroes when living as an enslaved or otherwise oppressed
race amongst the English or their descendants, though partly
to be ascribed to the neglect of their education and to the en
couragement which whites give to this dialect, by themselves
falling into it when conversing with negroes, is doubtless prin
cipally to be ascribed to the same physical causes which give
a characteristic softness to several of the languages on the west
coast of Africa, and thus, like the colour of their skin and the
form of their features, indicates the stock from whence they
are derived, independently of any infusion of words from their
own languages with which they may have corrupted the
English.      The investigation and classification of these
changes, influenced by physical causes, might greatly faci
litate the labour of those who may apply themselves to the
acquisition of several languages, as well as aid those investi
gations which more particularly fall under the class of which
I  am next to speak.

d'Egypte, has paid considerable attention to the Jaloff lah
guage and has composed a grammar, and I believe a dic
tionary of the same.      Hannah Kilham, a minister in my own
society, whose zeal led her to make three voyages to Africa,
reduced as many as five or six African languages, besides
the Jaloff, to a written form.      A laborious article has been
written on the Birbir language. The missionaries in Southern
Africa have paid some attention to the languages spoken in
that quarter, and the languages of the Copts and Abyssinians
have not been neglected.
    The widely scattered inhabitants of the islands of the Indian
Archipelago and Pacific Ocean compose twenty-four groups,
which seem to be referrible to two or three principal divisions.
In many instances the languages spoken by these groups are
                   ñºM.
confessedly allied. They are by most admitted to have more
or less affinity to the          properly so called. In some                                 in
stances the                are unknown, and in others they are
said, but upon what authority             I
                                      know not, to be quite pecu
liar. The     similarity between the languages spoken in several
of these   groups   was noticed by Captain Cook, and has been
confirmed by many voyagers since his time.            The subject of
these languages has been scientifically taken up by Marsden
and Crawford, by some German philologists, and by mission
aries employed by this country. Articles on this subject have
lately appeared in the Quarterly Review, and                 have re           I
cently been informed that Baron W. Humboldt is at present
engaged in a work on these languages”.           I must not attempt
                                                                                        j
to enter into any of the views of these authors, but I cannot
omit to notice the work and views of another author which
appear to me to deserve considerable attention. I allude to
the Essay of Dr. Lang on the origin and migration of the
 Polynesian nation. One of the objects of the Doctor's work
 is to show that the several dialects spoken in the islands of the
 Pacific Ocean are branches of the Malay stock; and again,
 that the Malay language, with                its

vance of Taboos; in the possession of the rite of circumcision;
in some of their games; and in the chewing of the Betel-nut.
   The Doctor devotes some pages to account for the origin
of a revolting peculiarity which has characterized nearly, if
                                                                                       35
not all, the widely extended ramifications of the Polynesian
race, namely, their propensity to eat human flesh. The Doc
tor accounts for it by supposing that it originated in the urgent
calls of extreme hunger experienced by those who made the
long and disastrous voyages which have given a kindred po
pulation to widely remote islands. In these voyages, often
performed without design, under the irresistible influence of
wind or current, the stock of provisions must often have been
extremely inadequate, and the starving islanders in their ca
noes may thus have been impelled to partake of the flesh of
such of their companions as may have first perished from
want, or they may have sacrificed one or more of their num
ber to sustain the rest. The recurrence of such causes, in
conjunction with the warlike habits of the people and their
human sacrifices, would tend to encourage a practice which
the almost total absence of animal food, excepting fish, would
be likely still further to promote.
    I need not, at present, further pursue the analysis of Dr.
Lang's work as respects the Polynesian nations' dialects and
manners; but before I notice that part of bis work in which
he endeavours to connect the Polynesian with the American
 nations, I must mention, from the before-mentioned tabular
 view given by Dr. Prichard, what appears to be the state of
 America with respect to            nations and languages. The for
                                to its
 mer appear considerably           exceed 300, and the latter seem                      to
 be  proportionably numerous, but                  of
                                            these many are unknown.

VI.         On the Geological Evidence of the Advance of the Land
        at the Head of the Persian Gulf.   By CHARLEs T. BEKE,                                                 >
        Esq., F.S.A.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
        HAVE  now to trouble you with the following observa
    tions on the Geological evidence of the advance of the land
at the head of the Persian Gulf, which you will oblige me by
inserting in the next Number of the Philosophical Magazine,
as a continuation of my paper on the Historical evidence on
the same subject contained in the number of that Magazine
this day published *.
   Almost eighteen centuries have now elapsed since it was
remarked by Pliny, in the passage which I have already citedt,
that “in no part of the world did the land advance so greatly
or so rapidly upon the sea” as at the head of the Persian
Gulf. In making this observation that ardent and careful                                                  in
vestigator of the phaenomena of nature at the same time ex
pressed his wonder (to use Mr. Lyell’s paraphrastic transla
tioni,) “that the fluviatile matter was not swept away by the
tide which penetrated far above the tracts where great acces
sions were made. This remark” (Mr. Lyell proceeds to say,)
“proves that he had considered the different condition of
rivers in inland seas, and those discharging their waters into
the ocean.” I may add that it proves even more evidently
that the subject of the growth of land at the mouths of rivers
was entirely familar to the natural historian, who                                             (it   is
                                                                                                     to   be

and it further demonstrates that special attention had been
devoted by him to the particular subject of the changes at the
head of the Persian Gulf, since he pointedly contrasts what
he conceives ought to have been the effect of the tide there,
with the consequences of the absence of tides within the Medi
terranean.
   From the examination, therefore, of what is ascertained to
have occurred at the mouths of the principal rivers flowing
into this latter sea, resulting from the continuation of the pro
cess which was going on in Pliny's time and to his knowledge,
we shall obtain the best means of forming an approximate
idea of what also have been the actual changes at the mouths
of those rivers which discharge themselves into the Persian
Gulf. For the present means of this examination we are
greatly indebted to the talents and research of the accom
plished President of the Geological Society.               It       fact,                      is,    in

42         Mr. Beke             on the Geological Evidence                     of the Advance of
      Itwould, however, be most unreasonable to imagine that
 the   quantity  of detritus brought down by the rivers which
 flow into the Persian Gulf was not of far greater amount than
 that of the rivers of the Adriatic, when we consider that the
 Po itself is surpassed in size by many of the tributaries of the
 Tigris, whilst “the great river, the river Euphrates”,” ex
 ceeds it at least five times in length.
     It may be impossible to determine the precise proportion
 between the quantities of detritus transported by the two
 classes of rivers respectively; but it will not be unreasonable
 to assume (as a first approximation only) that equal quantities
 of detritus have been produced from equal spaces of the coun
 tries drained.     Looking, then, to the basin of the Po and                                                              its

             the      Land at the Head of the Persian Gulf.                                     43
say, at   six times more than the area of the countries drained
by the rivers of the Adriatic.
   If then, in two thousand years a tract of 1000 square miles
has been formed in the Gulf of Adria from the alluvium
brought down by the rivers from 45,000 square miles of ter
ritory, it will (cacteris paribus) result, that at the head of the
Persian Gulf the accession from 270,000 square miles of
country will have been six times greater in amount; that is to
say, a formation of not less than 6000 square miles of alluvial
soil will have taken place within the last two thousand years:
and if we compute the same rate of increase to have existed
back from the building of Babel, this formation will have ex
tended to 13,800 square miles of land.
    In making the foregoing calculation it has been assumed
that the circumstances are similar in both cases: this, how
ever, is not precisely the case. The Adriatic is a gulf in a
tideless (or almost tideless) sea: the rise and fall of #. tide at
the head of the Persian Gulf is (I believe,) as much as 8 or 9
feet at spring tides.      From the effect, therefore, of the tide,
and also from that of a current which sets across the head of
the Persian Gulf from east to west, the accumulation at the
mouths of the rivers would doubtless be checked, and a por
tion of the alluvium would be carried eastward and south
ward, and be dispersed in those directions over the bottom
of the gulf. That such is actually the case is shown by the
chart of this gulf lately constructed by the officers employed
in    its
        survey          by
                    the East India Company; from which            ap                       it
pears, that whilst along the north-eastern           Persian side       or                      of
 the  gulf  the depth,    great  part,
                                  in   exceeds forty  fathoms, along
 the whole of the Arabian or western and southern side varies                             it
 from twenty fathoms         shallows which are unnavigable, and
                                       to
 which,     to    all
                  appearance, will soon rise altogether above the
 level of the sea.
     But,    on the other hand, the much greater depth             the                     of
 Adriatic, and      the Mediterranean generally, (which
                           of                                   many                      in

                                            is
 as              as        deep*,)   would tend very materially
                                                                                                 in to
      much      6000 feet

                             of                   the alluvial soil  of
 that sea; and would thus—to considerable extent,a            least,-                at
 counterbalance the effects of the tide and current          the Per                 in
 sian Gulf.
     On the whole, therefore, when we take into consideration
 the immense quantity                  of
                              alluvial matter which     carried down         is
 into the Persian Gulf, we cannot hesitate          admit that Pliny   to

44    Mr. Beke          on the Geological Evidence                          of the Advance of
 was not merely sincere in his belief, but also perfectly correct
 in his assertion that “in no part of the world” did the land
gain so rapidly upon the sea;” and consequently we cannot,
under any circumstances, be wrong in concluding that an ac
cession of land very considerably greater than one thousand
 square miles has actually taken place at the head of that gulf
within the last 2000 years. Hence it follows—and this is the
point for which I need now principally to contend,-that the
 identifications of the various places mentioned by the ancients
(and in particular by Nearchus) at the mouths of the rivers
and along the coast at the head of the Persian Gulf, which
have been made by geographers of modern times, and espe
cially by the late Dr.Vincent and Major Rennell, must neces
sarily be erroneous +.
    It is beyond the scope of the present paper to attempt to
determine the correct positions of any of those places, or even
to institute an inquiry into what may have been the direction
of the coast line at the time when the voyage of Nearchus was
undertaken, or at any other period of past history.        I will,
however, venture to offer the following suggestions, which may
not be unworthy of the consideration of those who at any fu
ture period may feel inclined to devote their attention to the
subject.
   In the first place, then, it will be necessary to revert back
to the time—whenever that time may have been, when the
Euphrates and Tigris discharged their waters into the Persian
Gulf by entirely distinct and separate channels, each possess
ing   its independent delta,     was formerly the case with the
                                                   as
Po and     Adige, the Ganges   and Brahmapootra, and the Red
River and Mississippit.
  *  This assertion    of course to be understood with reference
                            is                                          those                        to
portions only     of
                  the globe which were actually known       those times; for     in
the growth       of
                the land    the Persian Gulf will not bear comparison with
                                 at in
that which takes place     the mouths    the great riversof the New World,       of

     Next will have to be investigated the particular operation
of the causes which have produced the changes in the coast
line; the principal of which causes are the transporting action
of the rivers on the one hand, and the counteracting influence
of the tides and current on the other. By the simple operation
of the former of those causes, a progressive deposition of al
luvial matter would have taken place, which would have been
even and regular throughout: by the operation of the latter
cause, however,    that deposition would not merely have been
obstructed, but     regularity and equal character materially af

bracing the deposits of “Ludlow” and “Wenlock,” the latter
those of “Caradoc" and “Llandeilo.”       By this arrangement
the observer will not be embarrassed when he finds that
certain typical strata have disappeared. Thus, for instance,
when the zones of limestone thin out, by which the forma
tions of Ludlow and Wenlock are subdivided, it is no longer
practicable to mark lines of separation between them. Under
such circumstances the united mass will simply be described
as “Upper Silurian rocks,” whilst, wherever similar causes
prevent the separation of the “Caradoc sandstones” from
the “Llandeilo flags,” the two will be termed “Lower Silu
rian rocks.”
   A wood-cut is annexed, explanatory of the manner in which
these deposits are connected with the old red sandstone above
them, with each other, and with the slaty grauwacké rocks
beneath them. Although the lower Silurian rocks are fre
quently unconformable to the schistose grauwacké, as repre
sented in the wood-cut, there are situations in which a passage
from the one to the other may be detected.

       Mr. Murchison    on the   Silurian System of Rocks.     51
the most powerful and warlike, impatient of slavery, and of
  reat intrepidity.   Such was their confidence in their gallant
 eader Caradoc    (Caractacus), and so exasperated were they at
the saying of the Emperor Claudius, “that the very name
of Silures must be extirpated,” that they carried on a stubborn
war, not only under Caractacus, but long after his capture, de
feating the legion under Manlius Valens, and wearying out the
indefatigable Pro-Praetor Ostorius, who died when spent with
the difficulties they opposed to him. Veranius, who command
ed under Nero, attacked them in vain, and they were only
finally subdued by Julius Frontinus in the time of Vespasian!
British geologists, therefore, will not doubt that “Siluria” is
a name entitled to be revived, when they are reminded that
these struggles of their ancestors took place upon the very
hills which it is proposed to illustrate under the term       “Si
lurian system.”     Antiquaries are not agreed concerning the
exact   spot  in which Caractacus made his last stand against
the Romans. Camden has unquestionably erred in supposing
it to have been on Caer Caradoc, an error into which he was
doubtless led by the hill bearing the name of the great
 chief. The existence of a river at times deep and rapid is
pointedly mentioned by Tacitus, and there is no such feature
 at the base of Caer Caradoc.       The site of this battle is now
 most  generally  supposed  to be Coxwall Knoll", near Leintwar
 dine, about 10 miles west of Ludlow, and on the left bank of the
 Teme, to which stream the hill opposes a precipitous face.
 Having examined this locality with the eye of a soldier, and
 with the words of Tacitus in my recollection, I am disposed
 to doubt the accuracy of the conjecture, and I may, on some
 other occasion, point out the reason for this dissent, and
 suggest the             which the wily Caractacus may have
             +...".
 occupied. This, however, is of no interest to the geologi
 cal question, for even if Coxwall Knoll be the spot, it is in
 the very heart of the “Silurian system” of rocks.        Although
 a profound antiquary and one to whose erudition I ought per
 haps instantly to defer, is of opinion that the country  º    Si
                                                             the
  lures never extended so far to the north as Caer Caradoc
  and Wenlock Edge, I am still (until decisive counterbalan
  cing evidence be produced,) disposed to think that the terri
  tory over which this warlike race exercised an influence must
  have been prolonged to the gorge of the Severn.        It appears
  highly improbable that the north-eastern portion of a hilly
  system, which running from south-west to north-east has        its
  natural termination in  the parallel ridges  of
                                                Caer Caradoc and
   Wenlock    Edge, should  no  thave been occupied  or  controlled

      GENTLEMEN,
     I
     rejoice to see you assemble in these long-desired apartments:
the increased facilities now afforded to us of pursuing the objects of
our institution demand on our part a corresponding increase of exer
tion. Let it not be imagined that in accepting a boon from the Go
vernment we have not incurred an obligation. Our claim rested en
tirely on the sense which the public entertain of our deserts. The
full and accurate knowledge, which it has been our aim to ac
quire and publish, of the subterranean resources of                    parts             all           of
the   world,   cannot fail            to
                                   useful: be    long       the utility
                                                                so           our
                                                                            as                    of
establishment        distinctly felt, independently
                            is                                  bearings uponof   its

we rely       the continuance        public support; but our claim
                                            of                              that                  to
support would vanish          once,   atwe should relax our exertions, and
                                                 if
fail     realize those expectations which our hitherto well-sustained
         to
activity has kept alive       the breast

                                               our benefactors.
    Gentlemen, you are well aware that                           all
                                                   the accommodation which
you now enjoy has not been derived, however, solely from the be
neficence       the Government, set
                  of                           motion                       by

    The alterations planned by Mr. Decimus Burton have been exe
 cuted under his direction within the specified time, and               accord               in

 has not escaped the notice           the Building Committee; with what

   The concluding part of the third volume of our Transactions is in
the press, and the recent arrangements of the Council induce me to
hope that not this part only, but also the first part of the fourth vo
lume will be ready for delivery in the course of the present year.
   The number of our Fellows has received an addition of forty-two
and a diminution of ten ; of those whom we have lost, three only are
known to me as Contributors to the Transactions or as Geological
Authors.
   To the liberality of Mr. Matthew Culley, the chief of a family
greatly celebrated for the practical improvements they have intro
duced into agriculture, our Museum is indebted for a large series
of primitive rocks collected in the remoter parts of Sutherland
shire, as also for some fine specimens of the fossil fishes which occur
at Banniskirk, situated eight miles south of Thurso in Caithness.
The geological relations of these last have been since investigated
by Mr. Murchison and Professor Sedgwick, and their zoological
characters determined by M. Agassiz*. Mr. Culley also transmitted
to us an account of the prodigious power occasionally exerted by
rivulets when swoln by heavy rain.
   Major James Franklin was a younger brother of Captain Sir John
                                                   §.
Franklin, R.N. ; he commenced the survey of Bundelcund in India
in 1813, and continued it during four years, after which he joined
the army in the field, under the               of Hastings. In December
 1818, Captain Franklin returned to the duties of his survey, and
shortly afterwards was promoted to the rank of Assistant Quarter
Master General. In 1820, he commenced at Calcutta the construc
tion of his maps. He afterwards made a careful survey of Sincapore
and the adjacent strait.       Having repaired to England in 1823 for
the benefit of his health, he soon learned by communication with
members of this Society, how much the value of his surveys would
have been enhanced by geological descriptions.               On his return to
India in 1826, his first care was to supply this desideratum: he
solicited, though unsuccessfully, the appointment of Geologist to
the trigonometrical survey then carrying on in India, and strenu
ously recommended that                 all
                                officers employed                     on
                                                          that service should
be  qualified and encouraged          collect materials for the construc

tion  of a geological map              of
                                the entire Peninsula.       Declining health
brought him again           England
                              to           1829, where in                   he
                                                                remained till
his death, which took place                  in

shire, Worcestershire, Shropshire, and Cheshire, but with a small
proportion of gypsum.
   2. The beds immediately beneath are largely developed in the
north of Shrewsbury, in Staffordshire and Salop; the district which
they occupy is wild and barren, owing to the prevalence of decom
posed quartzose conglomerates.           Where sand predominates it is
more   fertile,  and the  country   assumes a character perfectly distinct
from that which      belongs  to the upper and lower beds.
   3. The    fragments   of the calcareous conglomerate are occasionally
of oolitic limestone, sometimes of old red sandstone, or of some mem
ber of the coal series. This division is unimportant on the east of
Coalbrook Dale, but in the western part of Salop it swells out and
corresponds with the dolomitic conglomerate of Bristol.            At Car
deston it is from eighty to one hundred feet in thickness;               es                              its

he never would have entered, as it were alone and single-handed,
on so irksome and laborious an investigation.       That the work is in
many respects imperfect must be admitted, but considering the ap
parent disproportion of his means to his end, it is surprising that the
author should have achieved so much : what he has left incomplete
or inaccurate will be readily supplied and corrected by the supple
mental labours of more fortunate observers, when the physical fea
tures of this extensive tract shall have been accurately delineated by
the Ordnance Department.
   For a detailed account of the carboniferous tracts in Salop and
the adjacent counties we are indebted to Mr. Murchison. The fol
lowing are the conclusions which his paper tends to establish.
   1. In the Shrewsbury coal-field the presence of a younger se
ries of coal-measure than has hitherto been noticed, characterized
by the freshwater limestone above alluded to.
   2. The recurrence of these beds at Coalbrook Dale, over an older
series of coal-measures which at one spot repose on mountain lime
stone, at other places either on the old red sandstone or on transi
tion rocks.
   3. The absence of these upper beds at the Titterston Clee hills,
where the lower beds rest in two places on mountain limestone, but
generally on old red sandstone, as they do invariably on the brown
        º
Clee hill, in the forest of Wyre and at Newent.
   4. In some of the poor and ill-consolidated coal-beds, particularly
in the upper part of the series, the characters of the fossil plants, both
generic and specific, can be recognised in the coal itself.
   5. The mountain limestone where it does occur in this part of the
country is of inconsiderable thickness, and wedge-shaped, so that it
shortly              entirely.  Its absence, therefore, is not to be im
puted to mighty convulsions, but to partial and scanty deposition in
the first instance.
   At Shaftoe, near Wallington, in Northumberland, Mr.Trevelyan.*
has observed among the constituents of the millstone grit, the low
est bed of the regular coal-measures, transparent fragments of gar
net; they occur there rather abundantly. He has also remarked
in other northern coal-fields small portions of hornblende in a simi
lar situation.
   The Rev. Mr. Williamson has directed attention to certain ra.
vines in the Mendip hills, and other heights which bound the coal
field of Bristol.  These ravines cross the ridges transversely so as
to connect the opposite valleys, being occupied in part by horizon
tal beds of dolomitic conglomerate and lias; he infers that the frac
tures took place before these rocks were deposited, and that the
bone-caves were formed at the same period.
   Dr. Lloyd first observed fossil fishes in the old red sandstone. Mr.
Murchison finds the observation true over a considerable extent of
country; they belong chiefly to the genus Cephalaspis of Agassiz ;
they have also been described by Dr. Fleming, as having been met

 It  contained ten oblong minute white eggs, 44ths of an inch long
by   ºths in diameter. It was found in the fork of a branch of the
Mimosa Arabica.
    The nest of the Orthotomus Bennettii was lodged in the cavity
formed by sewing the edges of two leaves together: the nest itself
also was attached to the leaves by threads passing through the leaf
and the bottom of the nest, and there were appearances of the end
of the thread being knotted outside. The nest is composed of very
delicate fibres of Indian Hemp and grass.      It contained two minute
oblong crimson eggs, ºths of an inch long by ºths wide.
    Col. Sykes also exhibited an egg of the fluviatile Tortoise of Duk
hun, Trionyr Indicus, Gray. It is a perfect sphere, 11", inch in dia
meter: the calcareous shell is of a peculiar alabaster-like white
ness. He found seven eggs with shells in the oviducts, and twenty
seven without shells, nearly of the size of the preceding, in one
specimen.     He took occasion to mention that in the stomach and
intestines of another specimen of Trionya, he found not only the
animals, but also angular fragments of considerable size of the shells
of some scores of large Uniones.
    A paper was read, entitled, “Description of some Species of
 Chama: by W.      J. Broderip, Esq., Vice-President of the Geological
and   Zoological  Societies,  F.R.S., L.S., &c.”
    The author commences by remarking that the shells of the genus
 Chama appear to be subject to every change of shape and often of
colour which the accidents of their locality may bring upon them,
and that the distinction of the species must consequently be diffi
cult, on account of their infinite variety. He then proceeds to de
scribe those brought home by Mr. Cuming, and now in that gentle
man's cabinet.      The Shells referred to were exhibited in illustra
tion of the characters and descriptions, under the following specific
names: CHAMA frondosa, pellucida, lobata, Pacifica, imbricata, pro
 ducta, corrugata, echinata, spinosa, and sordida.
    A Note by Mr. George Bennett on the Nasal Gland of the wan
 dering Albatross, Diomedea earulans, Linn., was read. It described in
 detail the gland situated in that bird above the orbit, as observed by
 the writer in 1832, and accorded with the account of it published by
 him in the Appendix to his ‘Wanderings in New South Wales,’ &c.
 It was illustrated by a drawing of his dissection of the head of an
 Albatross, made specially with the view of tracing the excretory duct
 of the gland, which he succeeded in doing for nearly two inches
 under the external plate of the upper mandible, in a direction towards
 the nostrils, but inclining slightly upwards, until he lost sight of it
 among the cellular substance of the bone. The writer notices the
 occurrence of a corresponding structure in other Birds, particularly
 among the Natatores, and refers to Müller for an account of the
 gland as it exists, in or near the orbit, in species of every order of
 Aves.
    A specimen was exhibited of a Kangaroo, recently brought from
 New Holland, by Capt. Sir W. Edward Parry, R.N., and presented
  by him to the Society.

    Mr. Bennett called the attention of the Meeting to it as repre
 senting a species not hitherto described, and distinguishable by its
 paler colour, which is generally of a slaty grey; by the whiteness of
 its tail throughout the greater part of the length of that organ; by
 the comparative length of the tail, which is here longer than the
 body, whereas in the ordinary greater Kangaroo, Macropus major,
 Shaw, it is shorter; by the comparative nakedness of the ears; by
 the great extent of the naked muzzle; and by a broad white stripe
 along each cheek. He stated it to be his intention to describe it in
 detail under the name of
    MAcRoPUs PARRYI.      Macr. rhinario lato; auriculis elongatis nu

     In a Note from Sir Edward Parry, which was read, it is stated
  that the animal in question is known to the natives in the neighbour
  hood of Port Stephens (lat. 32° S.) by the name of Wölläroo. This
 individual had been in his possession in New South Wales for two
 years previously to his embarkation for England, and was allowed to
 range about at perfect liberty.         It set out every night after dusk
 into the bush to    feed,  returning   generally   about two o'clock in the
 morning.    In addition to what it obtained on these excursions, it
 ate meat, bread, vegetables, &c.         Occasionally, but rarely, it ven
 tured out in the    daytime    to a considerable distance, in which case
 it would sometimes be chased back by strange dogs: these, how
 ever, it always outstripped by                          its
                                         superior swiftness, until    placed                              it

 England.

    In the stomach were found two hair-balls of an oval shape, not
 rounded as they generally are in the Ruminants, which are most
 obnoxious to these formations.               One of them was 3, and the
 other 2 inches in the long diameter. They were entirely com
posed of the hairs of the animal, matted together and agglutinated
by the mucus of the stomach. Mr. Owen remarks on the interest
which attaches to this resemblance to the Ruminating tribes, to
which the Kangaroos make so near an approach in the complexity
and magnitude of the stomach, and the simplicity of the caecum and
 colon.     He states that he has “more than once observed the act of
rumination in the Kangaroos preserved in the Vivarium of the So
ciety. It does not take place while they are recumbent, but when
they are erect upon the tripod of the hinder legs and tail. The ab
dominal muscles are in violent action for a few minutes; the head is
a little depressed; and then the cud is chewed by a quick rotatory
motion of the jaws. This act was more commonly noticed after
physic had been given to the animals, which we may suppose to have
interrupted the healthy digestive processes: it by no means takes
place with the same frequency and regularity as in the true Rumi
nants.”

   Mr. George Bennett stated that while in New South Wales he had
heard of an animal called Guinar by the natives, and found about the
Beran Plains, which was described to him as in some degree resem
bling a Kangaroo, but differing from it in having a bushy tail, and
in the form of the head, which was stated to resemble that of the
Hare. He suggested the probability that the Günar and the brush
tailed Kangaroo might be specifically identical.

that it resembled a small bright nebula, about 14" diameter, with a
very faint stream of light proceeding from the head, at intervals, ex

from that of the head.    The first was observed with a parallel wire
and the second with a ring-micrometer.

method of performing the eliminations by which we may obtain Fres
nel's equation to the wave surface in biaxal crystals, according to the
undulatory theory of light.     Mr. Whewell read a letter from Prof.
Schumacher in which it was stated that Messrs. Bier and Mödler
have, by observations of two remarkable spots during several months,
fixed the time of Jupiter's revolution at 9" 55" 26#" being a lon
ger time by 5% s. than that mentioned by Prof. Airy at the last meet
ing, as the result of his observations.   It was also stated that M.
Bessel had observed a long series of elongations of Jupiter's satellites,
and that these give the mass of Jupiter nearly identical with that ob
tained by Prof. Airy. Mr. W. M. Fisher made further observations in
confirmation of the views explained in his former communication re
specting Tubercles.
   Monday evening (June 18th), Dr. Clark, W.P. in the chair. Mr.
Willis gave an account, illustrated by models, of the progress of ar
chitectural art in the vaulting of churches in the middle ages.       He
observed that the Romans had devised arrangements by which paral
lelograms of unequal sides could be covered with vaults, as, for     in
stance, in the baths of Diocletian.  In this case we have parts cor
responding to the side aisles, buttresses, and clerestory windows of
the churches of later times. But a great revolution took place in the
decorative construction of such vaults when, instead of resting on
their supports as a solid mass, the ribs alone were multiplied to re
ceive the increased number of members of the vaulting and of the
pier arches, so as to form clustered piers. Differences were noticed
between the treatment of such piers in England and in other
countries.

BRITISH ASSOCIATION    FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE:
             MEETING AT DUBLIN IN AUGUST NEXT.
Th;       next Meeting of the BRITish Association for the AD
      vancEMENT of Science will take place in Dublin, and will occupy
the week,  commencing on Monday, August 10th. It is anticipated that
this meeting will present as many objects of interest to the friends
and cultivators of science, and will be as numerously attended as those
which have been held in previous years at Oxford, Cambridge, and
Edinburgh.
   The following is extracted from the circular addressed to the mem
bers by Dr. Hamilton and the Rev. H. Lloyd, Secretaries for Dublin.
   “Dublin, July 1st, 1835.-It is requested that Members who may
have any papers, or other communications, to lay before the Associa
tion, will state, before the end of July, their general nature and pro
bable extent, in letters addressed as follows:
         To the Provisional Secretary of the [Mathematical or Chemi
              cal, or other] Section, Royal Irish Academy, Dublin.
Unless this precaution be attended   to, great inconvenience must arise,

72                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.

and press of business.
   “It is also very desirable that the gentlemen who propose to attend
should signify their intention early, to the nearest local Treasurer, or
to one of the Secretaries for Dublin.
   “Information for members, on their arrival, will be given at the
Examination Hall of Trinity College, at which place there will be an

Finally, the Bornean animal described by Mr. Grant, in the article
just quoted, possesses nails on the hinder thumbs; while Mr. Mont
gomerie, who had obtained this specimen from Borneo, states that it
is the only one he has observed to be possessed of the nail on the
great toe; but ‘ that this is the only particular in which he dif
fers in the slightest degree' from the other Bornean Orang Outangs
which he has seen, amounting in number, as appears in the sequel,
to at least ten or twelve.
   “Whether two or more species of Simia have been confounded
together under the appellations of Orang Outang and Pongo, or
whether the discrepancies in the accounts of naturalists have arisen
from the examination of individuals of different ages, it would be
premature to attempt to decide.            But the legitimate inference from
                                                                               all

   An evaporating dish, containing about        lbs.    moist carbonate   28        of                       of
lead, was placed         sand-bath, and heated

inches, a pair of common bellows, with a glass tube attached to the pipe,
which pipe was introduced into a green glass bottle containing 12
ounces of distilled water, acidulated with 2 drachms of nitricacid. The
apparatus being thus arranged, the bellows were set in action, by which
means the atmosphere, loaded with the moisture from the lead, was
made to pass in a continued current through the liquid: this was con
tinued for six hours. The whole was then transferred into a platina
dish and evaporated to perfect dryness. The residue was dissolved
in one ounce of distilled water with two drops of nitric acid to insure
the solution of the lead should any be present. A current of sulphu
retted hydrogen was next passed through the solution, which immedi
ately gave a minute dark precipitate; this being collected on a filter
and washed, was transferred to a watch-glass, and treated in the usual
manner with nitric acid to decompose the sulphuret, which gave on
the application of hydriodate of potash the most unequivocal proof of
the presence of lead.
   Another experiment was conducted at the same time with similar
vessels in the same room, but the current of air was not passed through
the liquid. This on the application of sulphuretted hydrogen gave not
the least indication of lead, but, on evaporating the whole to dryness
and treating the residue in the manner before described with hydrio
date of potash, the slightest possible trace of the yellow iodide of lead
was perceptible. The nitric acid and distilled water were separately
tested with great care, but were found perfectly free from lead, so that
no doubt the trace of lead must have been absorbed from the atmo
sphere, as the bottle containing it stood beside the one through which
the current of            air
                    was passed.     ought                     to

S2                Mr. Charlesworth                  on the Crag-formation
same district.       These works, however, refer particularly to
 the  crag   of  Norfolk,    which it will be seen does not present
  nearly so extensive a series of fossils, or perhaps such inter
  esting geological features, as the same formation in the ad
 joining county. I must also mention the observations made
  by Mr. Lyell during a survey of the Norfolk and Suffolk
  coasts in the summer of 1831, and which are so ably de
 tailed in his Principles of Geology.
     The latest published account of the crag is in Professor Phil
 lips's Guide to Geology*, which                         I
                                              quote as illustrating the
 notions commonly entertained respecting the character of this
  formation.
     “CRAG-FonMAtion.              Mineral character. — It resembles
 almost   exactly    a  shingle   or pebble beach with layers of sand
 and   shells,  being   composed     of pebbles of various sorts, rolled
 and worn fish-teeth and bones; a few bones of quadrupeds,
 also worn; many shells, sometimes worn, sometimes not; parts
 of Crustacea, Polypifers, &c. The whole has an ochraceous
 aspect from the admixture of oxide of iron.            In one situation
 a coralline limestone of the same age occurs, and includes
 several of the same shells.”
     This extract gives a very good idea of the appearances often
 presented by the crag,                        .#
                                       particularly by those portions
 which have hitherto fallen under the inspection of geologists:
but there is a very important part of the formation to which
the description is by no means applicable, whether we regard
its  general mineralogical characters,           the apparent circum

   An interesting circumstance connected with the organic
 productions of the coralline crag, is the presence of a larger
 number of the Echinidae than generally appear to have existed
during the formation of tertiary strata.       I have not yet ascer
tained the   precise amount of   species,  but they include the fol
lowing genera, Echinus, Cidaris", Scutella, and Fibularia; the
last also occurs in the upper strata.
   The teeth of fish are distributed in considerable abund
ance throughout the greater part of the red crag in Suffolk :
most of them exactly resemble the teeth so frequently met
with in the London clay of the Isle of Sheppey and other
places, and which probably belong to fish allied to the genus
Squalus.
   In the crag these teeth have undergone some peculiar che
mical change, which has given them a dark colour, and ren
dered them extremely hard; they are generally much worn,
and exhibit a brilliant polish, which sometimes extends over
that portion formerly surrounded by the alveolar cavity.
Mr. Wood remarks, that he has found a few teeth of cartila
ginous fish in the coralline crag: I have only seen two speci
mens from         it,

some places deposits would be forming, which might after
wards, from an alteration in the force or direction of currents,
have materials of a very different nature carried down upon

only find alterations, in their character and stratification, but
  robably corresponding variations in the accompanying shells.

92            Mr. Charlesworth        on the Crag-formation
to inquire what was the probable extent of the period which
intervened between the formation of the coralline and the de
position of the red crag.
   In the divisions now so generally adopted of the tertiary
formations, the crag has been placed among the older Plio
cene; I need hardly remark, that these divisions are founded
upon the relative proportion of fossil shells which agree with
existing species. The series of fossils from the crag examined
by M. Deshayes amounted to only 111, and of these 66 were
pronounced by him to be extinct.      I much regret that at pre
sent no examination of this kind has been made of the newly
discovered shells; they will probably by found to include a
larger proportion of extinct species,      and perhaps to an
amount that would indicate their     belonging   to a period of
higher antiquity than the Pliocene *.
   In some parts of Suffolk, shells are found in the alluvial
soil identical with those now inhabiting the German Ocean,
and which have no connexion with the crag; these are pro
bably contemporaneous with the brick earth of the Nar, a de
posit in Norfolk evidently of recent origin.    It is therefore
of the utmost importance, in the examination of tertiary shells
from these districts, to obtain accurate information of the
precise localities in which they were procured.
   Mr. Woodward describes the Norfolk crag commencing
at Weybourne and Cromer, and running in a narrow band
across the eastern part of the county.    There is one circum
stance that appears to me particularly worthy of attention
connected with the amount of species obtained from this part
of the formation:
   As nothing analogous to the coralline crag has been ob
served in Norfolk, the deposit may there be looked upon as
agreeing with the red crag of the adjoining county.         On
looking over the list of shells obtained by Mr. Woodward
from the neighbourhood of Norwich, I find it contains only
80 species, while the upper or corresponding beds in Suffolk
have furnished 235: this difference we should not have anti
cipated.      If,
              however, the sandy strata                  of
                                             the coralline crag

attention of geologists to those parts of the formation which,
though not containing the remains of Testacea in the same

no less interesting nature, and which would amply repay

    to throw discouragement in the way of philological and other
researches into the origin and history of the American nations,

to the idea maintained by De                       that the Philippine
Islands were peopled from America, since the features of re

sition of a remote connexion between the Americans and these
islanders, whatever may have been the direction in which the
communication took place. . De Zuniga, in comparing the
language of the Philippine Islands to some of those which are
spoken by American Indians, says that they are strikingly
conformable in their character and structure. Dr. Lang main
tains the correctness of this assertion, notwithstanding              con               its
tradiction         by

                     In short, conceive that the ruins in ques
tion afford us a means of ascertaining the period at which the
forefathers of the modern Polynesian and Indo-American
races originally took their departure from the Indian Archi
pelago.” (Dr. Lang's Origin and Migrations of the Polynesian
Nation, p. 203-4.)
   The views of Dr. Lang, although founded on observation and
supported by several independent facts, and also possessing in
my opinion a great degree of probability, can only be regarded
as an hypothetical solution of the mystery which involves the
history and languages of the races to which it refers. It must
be remembered that it is opposed to the views of that great
Polynesian scholar W. Marsden, and is yet more decidedly
at variance with the opinion of the learned author of an article
on the Oceanic languages in the Foreign Quarterly Review.
It is the opinion of that author that the various insular lan
guages, as well as the continental, are in most cases distinct
and indigenous, and that the numerous coincidences which
are met with, and which he is compelled to admit as evidence
of a common connecting cause, are the result of infusions from
one common source into preexisting languages. To support
this view the reviewer has recourse to the hypothesis that there
had, at some former period, existed somewhere in the Indian
Archipelago one of those independent foci of civilization
which he calls in to his aid for the solution of several of the
difficulties with which the subject abounds.        I must confess
that it seems to me much more probable that the languages
spoken in the Oceanic Islands, whatever may have been their
origin, have been introduced into the different islands very much
in the same state in which we find them : this idea seems not
only more consistent with the general similarity which prevails
amongst the inhabitants of those islands with respect to pecu
liarities of race, manners, and religion, but also with the pre
vailing character of the languages themselves.          Moreover,
there is a want of simplicity in the conjecture that these islands
have each received for themselves, by infusion from a common
source, those words on which the most striking similarity de
 pends; it seems to involve the necessity of numerous accidents,
 precisely similar to each other, having happened to each of
 these inhabited islands. Difficulties of this kind are sufficient
to show that we are still greatly in want of the data from which
 a solution can be drawn.

 scribe, and collect these data should give the naked but com

   late, from time to time, the fragments which they may have
            together, since such surveys are not only pleasing in
themselves but may be the means of pointing the way to new
researches. Thus, I had no sooner read the view exhibited
by Dr. Lang than my attention was awakened to what may
be merely an accidental coincidence, but which nevertheless
 suggests an inquiry which may bring to light some curious
 facts.    In the last number of the Asiatic Society's Journal
there is an interesting abstract of a work by a Chinese anti
quary on the ancient vases of his country.                   These vases,
which     appear   to be as   highly  prized   by  the virtuosi of China,
as the     Grecian,   Sicilian,  and Etruscan vases are by the col
lectors of
portant rays
             Europe,
                       ºare  calculated,  like them, to afford a few im
                      historical light; in fact it appears that they
afford data which are even more valuable, since they preserve
inscriptions which are still legible, and may themselves be re
ferred with greater certainty to particular ages.               In looking
at the sketches of some of these vases to which the greatest
antiquity is ascribed, I was forcibly struck with a similarity
between the designs with which they are ornamented and the
carvings upon some implements brought from the South Sea
Islands. One of the points of resemblance consisted in the
mode in which uncouth representations of the human counte
nance are repeated upon the same article.                     I
                                                           am well aware
that there is no necessity to call in the assistance of remote
connexion between the artists producing these works, in the
fact of their both rudely attempting to imitate the same forms
when the originals were equally present to both.                   It is the
similarity in the mode in which they each deviate from nature
which   is,   atleast, remarkable.       The attention which this ca
sual observation excited, has induced me               look with greater
                                                      to
interest  at  the variously carved and ornamented implements
brought from the South Seas and preserved                    cabinets, and

I   have observed that besides the characteristic and often beau
tiful             which these carvings exhibit, we may occasion
ally find the representations         human and other figures which,
                                     of

  102     Dr. Hodgkin on the Importance of Studying and
 With this view    I conceive  it might be well for us to draw up
 a collection of queries to be forwarded to the societies in ques
 tion, accompanied with a short memorial urging the impor
 tance of the subject and soliciting cooperation. The Royal So
 ciety, the Geographical, the Zoological, the Linnaean, and per
 haps the Society of Antiquaries, might be memorialized for this
 purpose, and    I am inclined to believe that the officers of the
 Admiralty would be far from unwilling, if properly appealed to,
 to give most important aid in such an investigation.         There
 are other bodies which I have not yet mentioned, but which
 in the assistance they may afford us are inferior to none;        I
 allude to the different Missionary Societies.       Some of these
 have far more extensive relations with some parts of the
 globe, , and the feeble races inhabiting them, than any
 other bodies or associations.        The zeal and devotion of
 their  missionaries,  which   prompt    them not merely to visit
 but to reside  amongst   the uncivilized or half-civilized families
 of the human species, would enable them to collect more ex
 tensive and more accurate information than can be collected
 by the traveller transiently passing through the district, what
ever may be the superiority of his talents and acquirements.
 We are already indebted to some of those missionaries for
most important and valuable information of the very kind
which it is so desirable to collect. The name of Ellis, which
must be familiar to every one, will sufficiently illustrate this
remark.     But what missionaries have done in this respect has
been rather the fruit of their own good sense and individual
interest than the result of a general purpose, or of instructions
furnished to them by the Boards which have sent them forth.
    The character of some of their exertions is thus described
in an article on Kay's Caffraria, in the North American
Quarterly Review.
    “The attempt which the missionaries had made to trans
late special parts of the sacred volume into the Caffer lan
guage, manifests, in our judgement, more zeal than discretion,
According to our author, their plan has been to translate a
passage from the English version into “barbarous Dutch, and
then to express it in the Caffer language as dictated by an
ignorant interpreter.      Till some better method than this is
adopted many persons will distrust the benefit of the transla
tion, since it is probable that error or nonsense will take the
place of truth.     However this may be, many converts having
been made     amongst  the Caffers, and considerable inquiry ex
cited amongst the people generally, the period is probably not
far distant when Christianity, in some shape or other, will be
openly professed by the whole nation. A translation of the

lity, as the children of the missionaries, who will have learned
the native language, or the Caffer children who have been in
structed in the English, will be exempt from the inconveni
ence now experienced by the missionaries.”
    We cannot hope to draw sound and correct philological
inductions from data thus obtained.
    Many instances might be adduced to show that the zeal of
the missionaries is often greater than their knowledge and
wisdom, and has led them to destroy the existence and recol
lection of those relics and traditions which, in conjunction with
the affinities of language, afford the best, it may almost be said
the only, materials amongst which we can hope to find any sa

rendered them an important service, and receive in return the
most valuable cooperation which we can at present seek.
     Ifmissionaries have the means of obtaining the most minute
and accurate information in consequence of their longer resi
dence amongst the natives of uncivilized countries, the captains
and medical men serving on board our merchant vessels have
the advantage of affording more frequent opportunities of com
munication; and from the circumstance of their visiting several
tribes in succession, they have facilities for instituting compa
risons and discovering resemblances, provided their attention
were turned to the subject, which the missionary confined to
a particular spot does not possess.           We should therefore do
well to seek the assistance of merchants, both individually and
in their associations; and from their well-known liberality
and benevolence we may reasonably hope that the appeal will
not be made in vain. Several mercantile expeditions have
already made important contributions to our stock of know
ledge of the description to which I am alluding; and were the

would serve the cause of Philology. In the execution of this
plan, it is very probable that the liberality of the Admiralty
and of merchants owning vessels might most materially assist.
A combination of efforts for this purpose might form the basis
of an institution something like the Propaganda at Rome,
where young men from various countries are educated and
trained to become influential missionaries amongst their coun
trymen. The great importance which the most politic leaders
                           .
in the See of Rome attach to this institution is a strong proof
of the influence which it is capable of exerting, and it is some
what surprising that this example has remained so long with
out imitation amongst Protestant nations. It would not, how
ever, be necessary to wait for the formation of a magnificent
establishment like the Propaganda in order to act on the sug
gestions which    I have offered. The Managers of the London
University, whose liberality supplies us with the means of
meeting as we do this              might possibly be induced to
give to foreign youths, properly selected, free admission to the
classes; and the missionary societies and other associations un
der whose auspices such youths were brought to this country,
might easily provide for their suitable accommodaticn in the
vicinity of the University.
    If I am not greatly mistaken, the united operation of the
different plans which    I have proposed would speedily rescue
much valuable matter from the irretrievable destruction to
which it is now hastening; a stimulus would be given to a
most important branch of Philology, which would give it a
new position amongst the sciences, and it would acquire a popu
pularity which it had never before possessed. It is not every one
who is formed by nature to become a great Philologist: for the
formation of such a character, it is essential that the indivi
dual should possess an incommunicable talent for the acquisition
of languages, which seems analogous to that possessed by other
individuals who almost intuitively perform the most abstruse
and laborious arithmetical calculations.      Examples of such
linguists have been seen in Sir William Jones, the celebrated
Messo<U+017F>anti of Bologna, William and Alexander Humboldt,
Dr. Morrison, whose recent death has cast a gloom over the
friends to the religious improvement of Asia, and many others;

late friend John Fowler Hull, who when he was scarcely
twenty-five years of age had made himself familiarly acquainted

    XII.     On Magneto-electric Induction.      By   F.W Atkins.
             To Richard Phillips, Esq., F.R.S. &c.
      MY DEAR SIR,
     AVING lately observed in the Philosophical Magazine
      some descriptions of slight modifications of apparatus for
the  development  of magneto-electrical phaenomena, and pre
suming from their insertion that you think such contributions
interest your readers, I venture to offer to your notice an
account of a philosophical apparatus, or toy, which I have
contrived, and which     I
                         believe to be novel.
    The  production   of motion by magneto-electricity is not
new, many philosophers having already suggested and pre
pared various mechanical contrivances by which a body might
be made to move continuously by magneto-electric agency.
    Among the contrivances with which I am acquainted, none
can vie, either in simplicity or in beauty of design, with that
which emanated from the ingenuity of Mr. Saxton.            The     in
strument as originally constructed by him may be daily seen
in operation at the Gallery of Practical Science in Adelaide
Street.
    Having been, as you know, for a long time extensively en
gaged in the construction of electro-dynamic and magneto
electrical apparatus, on seeing Mr. Saxton's machine, I, with
his permission, immediately commenced making one nearly
a<U+017F>ter his fashion, and afterwards conceived that it might be
made to show an increased number of phaenomena.           Following
out my ideas experimentally, I obtained distinct revolutions
from eight magnetic needles, together with the vibration of a
ninth.       I
            am not aware that a multiplication of motion to
this extent has been achieved before; indeed, by applying a
second electro-magnet seventeen bodies might be put in mo
tion at the same time, and by a judicious arrangement even
more.
    The drawing which accompanies this communication re
presents my apparatus.        In arrangement it varies very little
 from that of Mr.   Saxton's,  the difference being merely in this
 respect, that Mr. Saxton places the aris which carries his
main revolving permanent magnet outside of the electro-mag
 net, while my axis is situated inside.        The only advantage
I  obtain is that the apparatus    is much more compact. Were
 this  all have
           I       to
                    advance       on
                                  the subject, should not trouble
                                                 I
 you with the present communication; but              as
                                                       Ihave added
 seven permanent magnets      in different situations, and succeed
 ed   inobtaining continued rotatory motion          all,

that I have thus rendered the magnetic toy somewhat more
interesting, and am therefore induced to think it worthy of
notice in your valuable Journal.
   The revolving magnets I have had in motion for eleven
hours without superintendence, and they were only stopped
when my workshop was closed for the day. The chemical

copper wire surrounding          produced merely

-ment that only the violet rays are effective in producing phos
 phorescence. This is confirmed by the recent experiments
 of Osann. The violet rays also cause the discolouration of
 the nitrate of silver, the rest of the spectrum being nearly                                 in
 effective.    This analogy is much in favour of my argument.
            I come now to consider what probable conclusions
                                                                                                    7

 can be drawn respecting the nature of light from the nu
 merous absorptions which it exhibits in passing through                                      ni
 trous gas, and the other coloured gases.                For the discovery
 of this most remarkable phaenomenon it is well known that
 science is indebted to Sir David Brewster.               The absorptions
 or dark lines in the      spectrum   produced      by  iodine vapour, are
 described     by  Professor Miller    *,   as  being  about a hundred in
 number, and equidistant. I have, however, found by careful
 observations that they are not equidistant, but that they be
 come gradually more crowded towards the blue end of the
 spectrum.        Baron von Wredet has observed the same fact,
 and established it by actual measurement.
    This approximation of the lines takes place gradually, and
 seems a consequence of some simple general law.                    There is
 also a space at each extremity of the spectrum in which no
 lines are visible. Now, in the former part of this paper I have
 advanced the hypothesis that the vibrations of light and those
 of material molecules are capable of mutually influencing each
 other.     It remains to be seen, whether the same hypothesis
 does not afford a clue to the explanation of this apparently
 complex phaenomenon of absorption.
     It is known that certain gases combine rapidly when ex

 because the light causes the molecules to vibrate, so as to
 come within the sphere of each other's attraction.

 kind, that light when traversing a transparent medium is able
 to excite motion among                     its

 schel, as affording at least a partial explanation of the phaeno
 menon, and moreover deducing it from a very simple cause.
    Baron von Wrede has lately published some speculations
 upon the same subject, which at first sight seemed to me co
 incident with my own. But his hypothesis is different from
 mine.     He supposes the particles of iodine vapour to be mo
 tionless, and that they act upon the light as minute reflective
 planes situated at small and equal distances from each other.
 According, therefore, to the usual laws of the interference of
 luminous waves, some are transmitted and others destroyed,
 according to the length of their undulations compared with
 the distance between the particles of vapour.

pleasure, for the warmth with which              objects were patron             its

120               Suggestions respecting the ensuing Meeting
ever, to the mode of exposition that I would apply the term,-
to science popularly developed,—not to what may be called
popular science; and I need not point out to men of accurate
knowledge and of clear and comprehensive views, that some of
the most important and refined objects of inquiry may be
treated in apt, plain, and intelligible language, and elucidated
by lively and appropriate illustrations.

hilated in Olbers's method, likewise takes place, and conse
quently the problem is nearly rigorously solved; for intervals
not quite equal the greater part of their amount at least is de
stroyed. These series show, likewise, the reason of Dr.                                              Ol
bers's remark at the end of the preceding paper, that it is gene
rally somewhat more accurate to take
                                   [r r"]         _     [R    RT]
instead of the more simple ratio of the intervals of time. The
error is less as long as             rz
                                  W2, but when r 7 & 2 the ratio
of time is to be  preferred.
    From the explanation here given the great success which
has attended Olbers's method on almost every occasion may
be sufficiently accounted for.         The quantities of the first
order are in   every  case  completely  taken into account.   In the
first place the possibility of the case of equal intervals, not a
very rare one, in which even the terms of the second order
with respect to the intervals are perfectly destroyed, and a                                          ri
gorous solution is obtained; and in the next place the cer
tainty that even in the cases of unequal distribution of the time
between the observations only a very small part of these latter
terms is neglected, insure to this method the preeminence
 over all the other known methods, which, as it is founded in
 theory, has from         very first publication been confirmed
                             its                                                                      by

 ner of proceeding of the other methods as well as of Olbers's.
 The method, as far as it consists not so much in the single for
 mulæ as in the manner of proceeding to find from the ratio of
 the distances the distances themselves by means of Lambert's
 problem, is not changed by this case of exception, but the first
 approximation becomes indeed less accurate, and the calcula
 tion becomes somewhat longer.
    In this case the combination of the two last equations of (13)
 cannot be applied, and it will be necessary to make use of the
 two first alone, or in conjunction with the fourth.            we                                                 If

Mr. Royle has not only afforded us that information which the title
of his work would lead us more immediately to expect, but he has
also presented us with a comprehensive sketch of the physical fea
tures of India in general, and of the Himalayan Mountains in par
ticular; with most valuable details respecting the adaptation of
animal and vegetable life to the conditions under which it exists,
the distribution of such life according to the localities fitted for it;

certainly no one would have anticipated from the unassuming title

   It is with much    pleasure   we observe that Mr.        Royle    omits few
opportunities of illustrating the power of science to contribute to
the happiness and welfare of mankind; we particularly allude to
those passages where he points out the capabilities afforded by the
variously situated portions of our Indian possessions for the growth
or cultivation of numerous important productions.              We experience
this  pleasure  not because we would wish to            degrade   science and
make it subordinate to the mere acquirement of pounds, shillings
and pence, but because it is most desirable to prove to the mass of
mankind, that, while their intellectual enjoyments are increased,
and their minds are expanded by science, their more ordinary oc
cupations are benefited in proportion to             progress.      its

                   The northern provinces and the hills forming the
more immediate object of this work, will be more fully considered
in the sequel; it is sufficient at present to observe, that at one sea
son they grow European grains, and at another those which are pe
culiar to the tropics; and that many perennials of both these two
climates seem to succeed equally well in the northern provinces of
India; here, therefore, many of the useful products of Persia,
Arabia, and Barbary, might be grown. . . . . . . Somewhere in the
valleys at the foot of the hills (Himalayan), or at moderate ele
vations, the more generally useful productions of European countries
might be successfully introduced, as the olive and hop. . . . . . .
 Here also, as I have recommended in a report to Government,
there is considerable prospect of success in the cultivation of the
 tea-plant, for the different elevations allow of every variety of cli
mate being selected, and the geographical distribution of this plant
is sufficiently extended to warrant                       its

   When we search into the present distribution of animal and vege
table life over the face of the globe, there are few subjects of greater
interest than the correspondence or difference, as the case may be,
between the animal or vegetable forms which are found under
nearly equal climates, particularly as regards temperature, whether
such equal temperatures be obtained by variations in altitude above
the level of the sea in different latitudes, or by the equal approxi
mations of localities to the equator or to the poles, as may happen.
The Himalayan mountains rising to a great height in a warm lati
tude, and bounding the lower lands of India on the northward, ne
j.
cessarily afford excellent opportunities for studying the effects of
diminishing temperature on animal and vegetable life as the tra
veller proceeds from the heated plains at the southern base of these
mountains, and rises to the line of perpetual snow of the highest
range.    These opportunities were not likely to be overlooked or
lost  by  a person of Mr.
                              ..".     acquirements, and accordingly
those parts of his work which are published, contain some very
              facts connected with this subject, and it is understood
that the parts which are to follow will afford us important additions
to them.
   Mr. Royle divides the slopes of the Himalayan mountains into
three belts, the first may be considered to reach “to between four
and five thousand feet of elevation, as several tropical perennials
extend to the latter, and snow does not usually fall below the
former.    The second belt may be conceived to embrace the space
between five and nine thousand feet of elevation, as the winter's
snow is always melted from such elevations before the accession of
the rainy season, and the upper is nearly the limit to which the
herbaceous plants of tropical genera extend.        The third belt may
be taken from this elevation   up to the highest limits from which snow
melts away on the southern face of the Himalayan mountains."
(p. 16.) Among the difficulties noticed by the author which attend
this division of the slopes of these mountains into belts of vegeta
tion, he adduces that “produced by the great difference in the ve
getation of the northern and southern faces of the very same range
or mountain, so that frequently a straight line running along the
summit of the ridge may be seen dividing the luxuriant arboreous
and shrubby vegetation of the northern face from the brown, bar
ren, and grassy covering of the southern slope.” (p. 16.)
   Mr. Royle offers the following explanation of the remarkable
fact, that the limit of the line of snow rises higher on the northern
than on the southern flank of the IHimalayas.
   “From the details which have been given, it seems abundantly
clear that the elevation of the Indian snowy range is sufficient to
prevent the passage across of the cloudy masses which deluge the
plains of Northern India with rain, both in the cold and in the
warm season. The atmosphere, therefore, on the northern face of
the Himalayas preserves unimpaired the dryness, which is the
characteristic of the rarefied air of lofty situations: hence the little

deposition of snow which takes place in winter in proportion to the
lowness of the temperature.      The returning warmth of spring ra
pidly dissolves this thin layer of snow from level places, in conse
quence, it appears, of the undiminished power of the solar rays in
passing through so rare and transparent a medium ; a fact tending
to confirm Mr. Daniel's views respecting the superior energy of the
solar rays in the higher regions of the air; and as this seems                                   al
ready to have been done with respect to his opinions of their great
power in polar regions, the fact is interesting as giving an addi
tional cause for the analogy between alpine and polar vegetation.
When the snow is once melted, these elevated tracts, surrounded
and confined by towering mountains, absorb heat as readily during
the presence of the sun, as they radiate it freely while he is absent;
and becoming, like the surface of the earth at ordinary levels, the
source whence the heat received from the sun is diffused to sur
rounding objects, they cause the line of perpetual congelation to
recede higher and higher in proportion to their own elevation.
Peaks and pinnacles, on the contrary, projected into the air like
promontories into the ocean, partake rather of the equability of
temperature of the media into which they intrude, than impress on
them, like plains and table lands, their own extremes of heat and
cold.” (p. 39.)
   Mr. Royle's work is illustrated by numerous well-executed plates,
more especially of plants, and by geological sections which are to
be described in the forthcoming numbers.        Altogether, we highly
recommend this publication to our readers, containing as it does,
not only an ample store of information respecting the natural pro
ductions of the Himalayas, but also the best general view of the
physical features of those magnificent mountains with which we
are acquainted.

such causes as are merely local, and that therefore the tides admit of
exact determination, with the aid of local meteorological corrections.
The curves expressing the times of high water, with relation to those
of the moon's transit, present a very satisfactory agreement with
theory; the ordinates having, for a space corresponding to a fort
night, a minimum and maximum magnitude, though not symmetrical
in their curvatures on the two sides of these extreme magnitudes.

the surface; for, instead of assuming the shape of solid glass-like
plates, it has more the appearance of aggregated masses of snow, and is
composed of small crystals of ice adhering togetherirregularly, either by
their sides or angles. Rivers are sometimes so choked up by accumu
lations of ground-ice of this description, that they are not only impeded
in their course, but also raised considerably above their banks. While
in this state, a slight change in the weather will frequently occasion
the complete disengagement of this ice from the bottom; so that, in

    From the fact that no carbonic acid gas is given out by venous blood
when that fluid is subjected to the action of the air-pump, former
experimentalists had inferred that this blood contains no carbonic
acid. The author of the present paper contends that this is an
erroneous inference; first, by showing that serum, which had been
made to absorb a considerable quantity of this gas, does not yield it
upon the removal of the atmospheric pressure; and next, by addu
cing several experiments in proof of the strong attraction exerted on
carbonic acid both by hydrogen and by oxygen gases, which were
found to absorb it readily through the medium of moistened mem
brane". By means of a peculiar apparatus, consisting of a double
necked bottle, to which a set of bent tubes were adapted, he ascer
tained that venous blood, agitated with pure hydrogen gas, and                                                                al

heat is evolved, as well as a dark colour imparted to the blood. The
author ascribes, however, the bright red colour of arterial blood, not
to the action of oxygen, which is of itself completely inert as a co
louring agent, but to that of the saline ingredients naturally contained
in healthy blood. On arriving at the lungs, the first change induced
on the blood is effected by the oxygen of the atmospheric air, and
consists in the removal of the carbonic acid, which had been the
source of the dark colour of the venous blood ; and the second con
sists in the attraction by the blood of a portion of oxygen, which it
absorbs from the air, and which takes the place of the carbonic acid.
The peculiar texture of the lungs, and the elevation of temperature
in warm-blooded animals, concur in promoting the rapid production
of these changes.

   Gentlemen, we had many of us an opportunity of witnessing at
the late Meeting of the British Association the increasing interest
and success with which geology is pursued in Scotland, and we
felt more especially grateful on that occasion to Lord Greenock
and the Highland Society, for the exertions which they have re
cently made to unravel the structure of their native land, and more
especially the nature of       coal-fields.  its      not my intention

measures of the county of Kerry were referred to the transition se
ries; the correctness of this statement was questioned at the time,
and various inquiries were instituted and persevered in, without
leading however to any very decisive result. Since the commence
ment of the session, the author on re-examining the district, has
with great candour acknowledged himself to have been in error. More
diligent investigation brought into view a well-characterized band
of old red sandstone, intervening in one part of the coal-field, be
tween the carboniferous and the transition strata.
     Mr. Jephson has transmitted to us an account of a remarkable
spring at Mallow in the county of Cork, the temperature of which
varies from 67° to 71*.*.           It breaks out in limestone.
     An   ample   and able account of the recent progress of our science
on the Continent will be found in the Report of M. Boué to the
Geological Society of France. I shall, therefore, confine my ob
servations on this head almost exclusively to the Papers which have
been read at our evening meetings.
     The first in order relates to the loamy deposit, called in the val
ley of the Rhine, Loess, a term as yet scarcely naturalized among us,
and which,       I  believe, is correctly represented by the word Silt.
This paper, from the pen of Mr. Lyell, has since been published
entire in Jameson's Journal.
     Intimately connected with this is a communication by Mr. Horner,
on the nature and quality of the solid matter actually suspended in
the water of the Rhine. To ascertain them the author made experi
ments during the months of August and November, bringing up about
a gallon of water from different depths and drying slowly the solid

     A paper by Mr. Cunningham describes the physical structure, and
  to a certain extent, the geological composition of the country be
  tween Hunter's River and Moreton Bay, in Australia, and is accom
  panied by a valuable map and section and a small collection of rock
  specimens.      The additions made during the expedition referred to
  by Mr. Cunningham are important, and the geological notices,
  though slight, will be welcomed by future inquirers.
     Mr. Rogers, who laid before the British Association at Edinburgh
  an able sketch of the “Geology of North America,” has more re
  cently favoured this Society with an account of the strata situate on
  the banks of the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and further, in the
  district of the Rocky Mountains. It may be said of                 these papers                all

    From the upper marine deposit of Dr. Morton, which corre
 sponds to the lower tertiary of Mr. T. A. Conrad, and to the older
 Pliocene of Mr. Lyell, numerous specimens were exhibited to us in
 the course of last session by Mr. Finch *. Of fifty-six species of
 shells observed by Mr. Conrad in this deposit, which extends through
 Maryland, Virginia, and the county of Cumberland, in New Jersey,
 one third still exist on the coast of America, but some species in a
 more southern latitude than that in which they are found fossil.
    The Miocene beds, if they occur, have hitherto escaped detec
tion. The Eocene, the middle tertiary of Mr. Conrad, which in En
gland is known as the London clay, and in France as coarse lime
stone, assumes in America the character of siliceous sand, and in
that form has been traced in a north-eastern and south-western di
rection from Alabama, through South Carolina, Georgia, and Flo
rida, as far as the Gulf of Mexico. Two hundred and nineteen
species of shells found in this deposit have been described by
Mr. Lea, but among them all, there is perhaps not one entirely analo
gous to any living species. Several of these shells belong to genera
unknown upon the coast of America, some to genera found fossil
in Europe, some to genera entirely new. It may be doubted whe
ther any of the species correspond with any of the Eocene fossils
of Europe, but the number of turreted shells and generic resem
blance satisfactorily establish the epoch to which they belong.
    It appears from the observations of M. Dufrénoy that in the
chalk of the Pyrenees fifty species, in a list of about two hundred,
have the character of tertiary shells.      A corresponding gradation
in the fossil contents of the tertiary and cretaceous formations is
observable in America. The Chalk, or rather the Chalk-Marl, of the
new continent occupies large tracts in New Jersey, Delaware, and
Alabama, and contains among other organic remains teeth of the Mo
sasaurus, in no respect differing from those collected at Maestricht.
    Mr. Rogers recovers the Chalk formation on the banks of the
Missouri, and about the mouth of the Omawhaw ; its transverse
limit is not known. No flints appear in the beds, but flint nodules,
like the English, occur plentifully lower down the river, even to the
Mississippi.
   The Ferruginous Sand of America reposes in the northern states
of the Union as in Sweden and along the Carpathian mountains,
upon primary rocks; in the southern, upon limestone, perhaps our
mountain limestone;       it forms an irregular crescent, extending
nearly three thousand miles, through Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, the two Carolinas, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,                Te
messee, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.
    Dr. Morton and Mr. Rogers refer this formation to the Green-Sand
of England with more confidence perhaps than their observations
warrant.     Sands red and green occur in Europe both above the
chalk and below       Zoological evidence rather militates against their

to the western continent.     Pecten quinquecostatus,  the only shell
which is quoted as being common to the sands of the United States
and this country, occurs also at Maestricht, and Baculites are cha
racteristic of the upper part of the chalk. From the occurrence of
great quantities of lignite in this formation, from the remains dis
covered in it of the Scolopax, a bird which inhabits the sea-shore,
and from the locality of the beds in reference to the ancient coast
line, Mr. Rogers infers that the deposit took place in shallow water,
along a coast, which like the present, presented a very extensive
range of soundings; to this circumstance he attributes the differ
ence of the American and European species of sea-shells at the
same period.
   With greater probability, as far as the evidence of fossils is con
cerned, Mr. Rogers attributes to the Green-Sand Formation of En
gland a deposit traced from below the Big Bend to the Rocky Moun
tains both on the Missouri and the Yellow River, characterized by
Hamites, Gryphaea Columba, and Belemnites compressus. Above the
Big Bend horizontal beds of lignite, sandstone, shale and clay, occur
continuously for several days’ journey.           The author considers this
formation to be of more recent birth; it contains, near the Cherry
River, beds of lignite from three to nine feet in thickness.

   The Bermuda Islands furnish a striking example of the intermix
ture of land and sea shells with the bones of birds and tortoises,
and likewise with vegetable remains. Some of the specimens which
accompany the paper have a structure distinctly oolitic, and in some
I  observe the delicate red tint which is met with in the chalk beds
of Yorkshire, or the oolite of Dijon. The cause of this, and still
more, the origin of the sand, the detritus of rubies which occurs in
one part of the shore, are curious subjects of inquiry. It is also
remarkable that breccias should be found at Bermuda, similar to
those of Nice, the island of Cerigo, and Gibraltar.

quarters that distinction which his superior knowledge and personal
character and deportment justly deserve. With a view to enable
him to devote a larger portion of time to the study of fossil
Ichthyology in Great Britain, the Association for the Advancement
of Science voted to him at Edinburgh the sum of 100l. During
his subsequent excursions in various parts of England and Ireland
he had ample opportunities of visiting whatever collections have
been made in that department of natural history to which he devotes
himself; and every one was happy to transmit to our apartments
at his request any specimens which he wished to figure.                    In the
very short space of time to which his stay in this country was
necessarily confined, M. Agassiz was enabled to add to the very
large number of species which he had already examined, no less
than two hundred that were entirely new to him; these were placed,
immediately as they arrived, in the hands of an artist from Neufcha
tel, acting under M. Agassiz's direction.              Such are the facilities
and advantages which Associations like ours supply to those whom
our motto designates as true sons of science!
     Sir Philip Egerton has drawn out for us a Catalogue of a rich Col
 lection of Specimens formed by himself and Lord Cole in the caves
 of Franconia and the Hartz Mountains. In the cavern at Galenreuth,
 now closed against visitors, it was their good fortune to obtain several
bones of the fossil bear, which the late Baron Cuvier required to com
 plete the skeleton of that animal. Many of them appear to have been
 scratched, but none gnawed. In                           all

 ditions which were essential to their birth and preservation.                To
 Col. Sykes we are greatly indebted for bringing under our notice a
 Collection of fossils made by Captain Smee in the district of Cutch.
 On comparing these remains with the fossils of the oolitic series in
 England, we observe, not without surprise, that one agrees in
 every respect with the Gryphaea dilatata, that another agrees equally
 with the young shell of Trigonia costata, that a third bears a close
 resemblance at least to the Ammonites Harveyii, while others are
identical with the Ammonites Wallichii, which is found in the range
 of the Himalaya.       I hope the interest which these species have ex
 cited will lead to a more extended investigation of the tract from
 which they were procured.
    Among the illustrations which will accompany a Geological                                Ac
count of Gurhwal and Sirmou, drawn up by Mr. Royle, is a plate
representing certain Shells collected by Mr. Gerard in the elevated
 valley of the Spiti; these shells may also be identified generically
 with those of the secondary formations in Europe.             Besides these,
are   given  the head and teeth of a small         species  of Deer, and the
 tooth of a    Rhinoceros,     obtained  by   Messrs. Webb and Trail from
 the lofty region on the north of the Snowy Mountains; and several
teeth of a carnivorous animal, a saurian, and fish, discovered by

 Mr. Cautley at the southern base of the Himalayan chain.
    A list of          found in the Lias of Yorkshire by Mr. Williamson,
jun. of Scarborough, will be valuable to us as a local monograph,
and still more so as a type to which we may refer the fossils of
the same formation in other parts of the country.                 The author
is of opinion that every particular layer is characterized by pe
culiar organic remains, a statement which must be received with
caution; it may be true where the district examined is very small,
but published lists, which deserve the greatest confidence, establish
beyond        all
               doubt that those species which abound                 formation

Seen from another point of view, however, these plates become
immediately valuable; for though the objects engraved were too
indistinct perhaps to enable us to determine the genus, class, or
order to which they belong, a correct delineation of them may be
sufficient to enable us to identify them with objects found in other
coal-fields, perhaps in very distant parts of the world.
   The author adopted at an early period the opinion that “Strata
are characterized by their Fossils," and he appears to think, that
in the coal-field under his consideration, each bed of shale has
vegetable impressions of        own. By the precision with which the

 lets   of water containing iron and salts in solution.        Near Hunter's
 Path are      seven beds      of anthracite; the laminar and slaty rocks be
 longing to the great transition clay-slates repose on compact sono
 rous argillaceous limestone, and considerable beds of quartz occur
 in the midst of the slate formation ; this coast, therefore, seems to
 be very analogous to that of Bideford: it is desirable to ascertain
 whether the beds of anthracite are here also accompanied by im
 pressions of plants, and whether they can be identified with those of
the independent coal districts.
    The distinctness of the Bideford section, and the great ex
perience which Mr. De la Beche possesses in geological surveying,
make it highly improbable, I think, that the plants which he has
presented to us can belong to any other formation than that to
which he has referred them: that the same fossils, vegetable as well
as animal, are confined to one particular epoch, and cannot be found
in more than one part of the general series, are presumptions, which
if countenanced, as to a certain extent they are, by limited expe
rience, more enlarged experience may not unnaturally be expected
to overthrow, unless indeed we choose to suppose, amid               the ob            all
scurity that surrounds us, that our knowledge has already reached                                        a

   The exhibition was resumed of the Shells collected by Mr. Cuming
on the western coast of South America and among the Islands of the
South Pacific Ocean.      Those brought before the present Meeting
were   accompanied   by  characters by Mr. G. B. Sowerby, and com
prised the following species, the characters of which are given in the
‘ Proceedings.”
    Genus Hipponyx. “Of this remarkable genus Mr. Cuming brought
home three species in such perfect condition, as respects the shell, as
to possess both valves in situ. The two specimens which exhibit these
three species appear to me so interesting that I shall venture upon a
particular description of them. The first, of the species which I have
named Hipp. Mitrula, is a group of about twenty individuals, of va
rious sizes, from sº to 4 an inch in diameter, adhering by their lower
or flat valves to an irregular piece of stone; the attached valves as
usual, are conformed to the irregularities of the surface of the stone,
and when they have been at first attached to a cavity, they are hol
low: the upper valves are also somewhat modified in form by the
 same cause, so as to be more or less regular according as the lower
valve has adhered to a more or less smooth and even part of the
stone. The attached valves have not attained a great degree of
thickness, consequently I do not suppose any one of the individuals
to be of advanced age; there are, however, several which can only
just have occupied their positions on the stone: these are not above
wn part of an inch in diameter, and they show the perfect point of
the upper valve, somewhat convoluted and inclined toward the ante
rior edge.    Other individuals, which are placed in a cavity of the
stone, are very regular in shape, but have their ridges slightly curved
upwards in conformity with the nearly regular vesicular shape of the
cavity.    The edges of the lamellae near the outer margin in most of
the specimens are furnished with a thin fringe of epidermis, but the
very young shells are destitute of this. An individual of Hipp.
subrufa is observable among the group of Hipp. Mitrula:            aper         its    is
distinctly spiral and       its
                           epidermis hairy.

                                          the species which have named      I

    Mr. Owen read some Notes (given in the ‘Proceedings,') of a
 Dissection of a long-tailed Dasyurus, Dasyurus macrourus, Geoff.,
 which recently died at the Society's Gardens.               He stated in the
 course of these notes that the subject was a female, adult, weighing
 3lbs. 83 oz., and measuring from the extremity of the jaws to the
 root of the tail 1 foot 4 inches, the length of the tail being 1 foot
 2+ inches, and that of the head 4 inches.           The vaginal orifice and
 the anus were situated within a common          outlet,   just below the root
 of the tail. There were six       nipples,   arranged    three on either side,
describing three quarters of a circle, and seated within a slight fold
 of integument, of a corresponding shape, 3 inches anterior to the
cloacal outlet.
    The external oblique abdominal muscle terminated below in a
strong tendon, which was folded inwards, like Poupart's ligament.
The abdominal ring consisted of a slit, bounded externally by Pou
part's ligament, and internally by the marsupial bone; and Mr.
Owen stated it to be his opinion that the marsupial bones are essen
tially ossifications of the tendons of the external abdominal muscle
which constitute the internal or mesial pillars or boundaries of the
abdominal rings.      The transversalis abdominis and internal oblique
muscle were distinct.
    The pancreas was a broad, flattened, branched gland, with a pro
cess given off at the splenic end from the main body, so as to pro
duce, in a transverse section, the figure of the letter T. The pan
creatic duct joined the biliary just at            termination.     its

air has been particularly noted by Mr. Hunter in his celebrated
Paper on the air-cells of Birds, in which he throws out a suggestion
that it may assist the birds of this species in carrying heavy loads
in their large fauces. This supposed relation of extended air-cells
to a largely developed beak is borne out in the case of the Hornbill,
in which every bone of the skeleton is permeated by air, but is ap
parently contradicted by the Gannet: I say apparently, because, al
though the rami of the lower jaw do not, in this species, afford sus
pension to a capacious reservoir as in the Pelican, yet the bird may
occasionally have to bear away a considerable load, as, for instance,
in a large fish seized by its mandibles, and a previous accumulation
in      its   dilatable      a    sophagus.

nearly with 5 equivalents of water to 1 equivalent of anhydrous

      The Committee appointed to superintend the preliminary arrange
  ments have already received notice of the intended presence of
  several of the most eminent men of science in Europe. The Geo
  logical Society of France meets in the beginning of September at
  Mezieres, and after examining the country there, and around
  Namur, Liege, and Aix la-Chapelle, joins the German Association
 at Bonn.    The attractions of such an assemblage will be greatly
 heightened by the beauty of the country around the place of meet
 ing; and the neighbouring Siebengebirge, Laacher See, and Eifel
 will present especial objects of interest to the geologist.
     There will be sufficient time to go to Bonn after the meeting of
 the British Association in Dublin, and we hope that our own coun
                                                                                  º

bined water; this water appears certainly to have taken the place
of the muriate of ammonia, with which it was previously in combina
tion, for when the substance is heated after having been completely
dried it disengages a large quantity of ammoniacal gas, without
undergoing any change of appearance.          it be heated with oxide       If
of copper a considerable quantity of water is obtained, amounting
to 24-27 per cent.
    100 parts gave 92.47 of phosphoric acid, equivalent to 40.68 of
phosphorus.    The determination could not be exactly made ; too
little was always  obtained, on account of the formation of nitrous
acid. 0-193   gramme    gave a quantity of azotic gas which indieated
28526    per cent.;  but estimating by the deficiency of weight re
quired to make 100 with the phosphorus and water, it should be
rather more than 35 per cent.

   the Philosophical Transactions for 1821, Sir John F. W.
INHerschel  has entered minutely into the theory of the double
achromatic object glass, and has given various useful tables
showing the curvatures of the lenses to be employed in order
that the spherical and chromatic aberrations may be de
stroyedt. Sir John Herschel seems to have intended to consi
der at some future time the modifications which would result
in the inquiry when the thicknesses are not neglected, but                     I
am not aware that he ever carried this intention into effect.
I  have therefore endeavoured to put the expressions which
occur in the theory of spherical aberration in the most ad
vantageous form.               In
                         this form they admit of extension to
 the case when the thicknesses of the lenses and the interval
between them are considered, without any difficulty.
    Whether or not opticians will ever trust in great measure
 to theory for the curvatures of the lenses, taking care pre
viously to ascertain with precision the optical characters of
 the glass of which they are composed, may admit of doubt;
 but it would certainly be useful to know the figures of the
 lenses and other circumstances connected with any large ob
ject glass whose performance is considered perfect, in order

that these data might be compared with the results given by
theory ". Unfortunately no such measures have yet been
published, as far as I am aware, except those in Sir David
Brewster's Encyclopaedia, under the article Achromatic Tele
scopes; but certain data are there wanting to render them
complete.    I am informed that the universal practice in this
country and in France has been to make the flint lens double
concave, and not concavo-convex as theory indicates, which
circumstance seems to me very extraordinary.       I am told that
Fraunhofer  employed   the latter construction; but it would seem
from the representation of an object glass incidentally given
in a plate which accompanies his paper on the lines in the
spectrum, that he did not do so invariably.
     Let EA or           ER        = r       AQ = A                 A   q   = A        RP=y
QR    is the incident ray meeting the axis A E in Q, R q the
refracted ray, the direction of which cuts the axis in q,
E the centre of the surface of which RA is a section.                                      RP
is drawn perpendicular to A E. The notation employed is
that of Mr. Coddington's Elementary Treatise on Optics, 2nd
edit., p. 54.

                      to Herschel,  “when the    average values                                                     of

 or  the more dispersive kinds                                 of

                       this condition, Sir John Herschel recom
mends another, which results from making equal            zero the                                     to

county to the south, west, and north, and a line drawn from
Wells to Thetford traces     eastern limit.    its

comprised within this area are, the chalk, with and without
flints; the chalk-marl, including the firestone; the gault; the
inferior greensand; the Kimmeridge and Oxford clays.

of spathose matter in them and in the present cliff. It has not
been determined to what depth the breccia extends, but it has
been stated that the clay beneath is exposed at low water.
   At Dersingham the lower portion of the sand exposed is
colourless, nearly pure silica, sufficiently so for the use of the
glass manufacturer, and is shipped in large quantities for the
glass furnaces in the north.
   Between the castle and the water-mill at Castle Rising, I
observed large blocks of sandstone lying by the road-side, ap
parently removed from the loose sand dug for domestic pur
poses: they varied in colour from light ash to nearly a black.
   At Middleton, to the left of the road leading from East
Winch to Setch, a large quarry is worked for building-stone,
called the Blackborough Car-pit; it is opened to the depth of
twenty feet, and the stone is highly ferruginous, overlying the
loose variegated sand which comes to the surface at the base
of the hill towards the west. At this locality the carstone is
intersected by innumerable veins of ironstone from one eighth
to an inch in thickness; they run horizontally and vertically,
forming grotesque lines,            all
                               tending         concentric arrange
                                                        to   a

     The well at the school-house                                    at     Bilney passed through the
same series of strata, but at this locality the gray limestone
inclosed Inoceramus gryphacoides and Belemnites minimus; the
clay contained the same Belemnite, and also Belemn, attenuatus.
From an old clay pit near Pentney church, I took the above
two species of Belemnites: this                                      is,

       the Sun's direct Rays in high than     in low Latitudes.     185
about the vernal equinox, when the meridian altitude of the
sun does not exceed 24° 48', and the mean maximum tempera
ture of the air is 3°-9; whereas in London the sky is clearest in
June, about the summer solstice, when the meridian altitude
of the sun is 61°57', and the mean maximum temperature of
the air is 69°4.     Now, according to Sir John Leslie", if the
atmosphere be equally clear, the number of rays which reach
the earth when the altitude of the sun is 61° 57', is to the num
ber when the altitude is 24°48', nearly in the ratio of 725 : 507.
Hence it may be concluded that when the temperature of the
air was very low, 507 rays produced a greater calorific effect
than 725 rays when the temperature of the air was high.
   The following experiment, though less striking, leads to the
same conclusion.
    By the observations of Professor Daniell in London, and
of Dr. Richardson at Fort Franklin, it appears that at both
places the maximum effect of the sun's rays upon a blackened
thermometer was 65 degreest of Fahrenheit's scale.              But in
this as in the former       experiment,     the observation at Fort
Franklin was made in March, while that at London was made
in June; it follows therefore, according to the rude method
of approximation already adopted, that the calorific effect of
the sun's rays when the temperature of the air is 69°4, is to
the effect when the temperature is 3°-9 in the ratio of 65:65
 x      or 65 : 89.

    It would have been desirable to have been able to compare
with the foregoing observations of Professor Daniell and Dr.
Richardson those of Captain Sabine in tropical climates.
But Captain Sabine's observations having been made (at least
those at Sierra Leone, and probably also those at Bahia,) du
ring the prevalence of a cooling wind, they cannot be pro
perly referred to as indicating the marimum effect of the sun's
rays.     Still, when compared with similar observations in
higher latitudes, they strongly confirm the result already de
rived from a comparison of the sun's heating power at Lon
don and Fort Franklin.
    But there are some circumstances respecting the foregoing
experiments which may seem to detract from their value, or
to point to a different conclusion from that which has been
drawn from them.
   * Supplement to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, article CLIMATE.
   + The maximum effect observed by Captain Back and Lieut. Kendall,
at Fort Franklin, was on the 1st of April, and amounted to 70 degrees;
but as the thermometer was sheltered by a glass case, and therefore not
under the same circumstances with Professor Daniell's instrument, Dr.
Richardson's  maximum is adopted.

186              Mr. Dalmahoy                    on the greater calorific Effect                 of
   1st, Dr. Richardson      remarks that the indication of the
photometer bore a larger ratio to that of the blackened ther
mometer in March than in May, and this may, perhaps, sug
gest a doubt as to the accuracy of one or both of these instru
ments. But if it be considered that the photometer is directly
affected only by solar radiation, while the blackened thermo
meter is influenced both by solar and terrestrial radiation, it
will appear probable that the variation alluded to arose from
no defect, at least in the photometer.
   2ndly, Further, the apparent greater effect of solar radia
tion at Fort Franklin may be ascribed to the reflection of                                                 in
direct rays from the snow.         But as observation seems to
prove the effect of the sun's rays to be greater in temperate
than in tropical climates independently of the presence of
snow, it follows that the cause assigned above is not sufficient
to account for the whole difference of effect at Fort Franklin.
Moreover, judging from the effect of the sun in melting the
snow when the temperature was much below the freezing
point, there is reason to doubt whether snow, as the objection
assumes, reflects the heating rays in great quantity*.
   Since, therefore, the experiments which have been adduced
(though less satisfactory than if they had exhibited the mo
mentary effect of solar radiation) seem liable to no important
objection, it may be fairly inferred from them that, at equal
altitudes of the sun, the heating power of             direct rays                   its
                                                               when                                        it is

    But going back 400 years before Pliny, to the reign of Alex

 Nearchus, illustrated by the masterly exposition of that sub
ject by Dean Vincent, and the navigation of those rivers per

facts in proof that the broad outline of the coast had, as to
any point in question between Mr. Beke and me, undergone
no material change for the last 2200 years. This is                     passed                 all

    Then as to the navigation of Alexander and his fleet in the
 delta streams.   Arrian thus gives it * : Alexander, having
joined his fleet at Susiana, “ sailed down the river Euleus
towards the sea; and now when near                 outlet      the ocean,                its                   to

unless    it be, what becomes of all that is said there, and before
and after this, in the next sentence, is repeated, about Pliny’s
 error? The 3300 stadia which Alexander's officers had
 reckoned it from the sea to Babylon, here at least, could not
 possibly have been the stadia of 16 to a mile, or 206% miles
 only.     If the distance of Charax, the port, had increased but
 70, the whole distance to Babylon could have increased but

 even this 70 is not to be reduced, in fact, to 35 only; so that
 without the above extravagant hypothesis, the              point of
 245 miles more of delta since the voyage of Nearchus (B.c. 325)
 is thus at once disposed of *.
    It is due to Dean Vincent (whom the reply unceremoniously
 throws overboard+) to say, that no one felt the difficulty of
 adapting a fixed standard of ancient measurement to his sub
ject more than he did. In employing, with M. D'Anville, the
so-called stadium of Aristotle, he admitted that it is not to be
found in Aristotle; that it is not, “perhaps, possible to measure
 500 stadia in any detached portion of the [Nearchus's] course
with satisfaction;” that the stadium of the generality of ancient
writers is eight to a Roman mile; and that D'Anville's mea
sures “still leave some obscurity behindf.”         Major Rennell
insists on a much longer one than Aristotle's S.        Pliny || and
 Strabo'<U+017F>, who both mention Nearchus's voyage and the distance
to Babylon, both notice the stadium as being that of eight
to a mile, and Dr. Falconer, after a learned investigation,
concludes this to be the stadium of Arrian and the other ear
lier writers. Surely the length of the stadium offers no sound
 basis for a theory”.

 Khorna".    From Khorna, then, there must be an ample rise
 north-west along the course of the Tigris, and from it a de
 scent south-west towards the level of the Euphrates; and as
 the rivers of Susiana run in this direction f, there must be a
 further rise over the delta through Susiana to the mountains.
 Whilst, on the other hand, the current of the gulfsetting strongly
 from the north-east to the south-west,-from the direction of
 the Tigris towards that of the Euphrates, Hmust, on this theory,
 rather have raised the relative level of the Euphrates' channel
 throughout the mighty embankment.

 of of
     this progress, would inevitably have fallen into the channel

   1835.              YHE reading of a paper, entitled, “On        the Influence of
June 4.—            the Tricuspid Valve of the Heart on the Circulation
of the Blood.” By T. W. King, Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by
Thomas Bell, Esq., F.R.S.,-was resumed and concluded.
    The purport of this paper is to prove experimentally that the tri
cuspid valve of the human heart does not, in the ordinary state of the
circulation, completely prevent the reflux of blood from the ventricle
into the auricle on the right side, and that the amount of regurgita
tion is continually varying according to the different degrees of disten
tion of the ventricle. The author points out the anatomical differences
between the auriculo-ventricular valves on the right and left sides of
the heart; from the consideration of which it might have been inferred,
independently of direct experiment, that while the structure of the
mitral valve is adapted to close accurately                                all

   “Report of a Committee for collecting Information respecting the
occurrence of, and the more remarkable Phaenomena connected with,
the Earthquakes lately felt in the Neighbourhood of Chichester.”    By
J. P. Gruggen,   Esq.   Communicated in a letter to P. M. Roget, M.D.,
Sec. R.S.
   This paper contains an authentic report of several shocks of earth
quakes which, during the last two years, have been felt at Chi
chester and the surrounding country; drawn up from accounts given
by various correspondents, in answer to printed queries extensively
circulated.    The first shock occurred on the 18th of September, and
the second on the 13th of November, 1833. Another and more se
vere shock was felt on the 23d of January, 1834, and in the latter end
of the same year two slighter shocks were experienced, namely, one
on the 27th of August, and the next on the 21st of September; the
last, which was less than any of the former, took place on the 12th of
January, 1835.
   The Society adjourned over Whitsun week to meet again on the
 18th instant.

  “Discussion of Tide-Observations made at Liverpool.” By J. W.
Lubbock, Esq., W.P. and Treas. R.S.
  The author has here presented to the Society, by permission of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science, a discussion by
M. Dessiou of about 14,000 tide-observations made at Liverpool, on
the plan similar to that adopted with regard to the London Dock ob
servations. The first book contains the moon's transits, classified
with the moon's parallax and declination, together with the date and
corresponding time and height of high water ; the height of the baro
meter is also added to the observations of about four years. The
second book contains the same quantities, classified further according
to the different calendar months, and for each minute of the moon's
horizontal parallax.   The third book contains a similar classification
for the moon's declination.   The average results are given in tables
at the end.
   Some remarks are subjoined on the registers of the observations
taken at the London and St. Katherine's Docks; from which it appears
that the tide is about five minutes earlier in the former than in the
latter of these two places; and that the difference in height is about
five feet.

   “On the Ova of Women and Mammiferous Animals, as they exist
in the Ovaries before Impregnation.”             By Thomas Wharton Jones,
Esq. Communicated by Robert Lee, M.D., F.R.S.
   After reviewing the accounts given by various authors of the struc
ture of the ovaries, corpora lutea, and ova in different tribes of ani
mals, the author proceeds to the anatomical description of the ovaries
in the human species, which he finds to correspond with those of the
Mammalia generally, and to consist of a parenchyma or stroma, and
an envelope or indusium, derived from the peritoneum.                 The stroma
immediately under the peritoneal envelope is condensed into the form
of a tunic, to which the peritoneum closely adheres, and which has
received the name of the tunica albuginea, or indusium proprium. The
vesicles of De Graaf are imbedded in this tunic, and are situated prin
cipally near the surface of the ovary: in the human species they are
about one fifth of an inch in diameter. The proper capsule of the
Graafian vesicle is composed of two layers; the outer being thin,
dense, and vascular; the inner, thicker, softer, and more opake.
The nucleus of the vesicle consists                1st,                     of,

   The author observes that the act of inspiration tends not only to
favour the passage of the blood into the venae cavae, but also to detain
it in the pulmonary vessels, in consequence of the expansion of the

   Before I quit this branch of the subject,                        I
                                                      would wish to suggest
to future visitors of this  temple,  the  following   topics of inquiry.
   What parts of the building have undergone repair? Can the date
of these repairs be deduced from the nature of the materials em
ployed, or the character of the workmanship 2
   Where is the pavement out of level, and to what amount? Are
the subsided parts under the lines of thoroughfare, or can their sink
ing be traced to imperfect construction? Is the foundation such as
an architect would call secure? Does it stand on stratum No. 6 of
Mr. Babbage's section ?
    Were there roofs to the bath-rooms?
   Would the fragments No. 6, 7, 8, form one column, or more than
one P. Was the original number of large (cipollino) columns greater
than four P
   Is the tufaceous deposit on No. 7 the same as that on the walls?
    Are all the water lines horizontal P
    Brick-work is found in the strata which buried the temple. What
is the character of this brick-work?          Is it reticulated?
   Draw   up  a detailed and exact account of the strata.
   What is the nature of the thermal spring 2 Evaporate a few
gallons of the water, and send the deposit to the Society.
   The plan which accompanies Mr. Babbage's paper being copied
from that of Jorio, it is desirable, in order to prevent confusion and
save expense, that this plan, with the numbers attached to             should                it,
be   adopted      any future description.
                   in
    In the concluding part                  of
                                   the paper, Mr. Babbage proceeds                                      to
show      what manner existing causes may possibly elevate conti
         in

within the boiler        steam-engine, encased
                         of   a                         wire gauze       tem

perature      of
              about 300°   commonly     for ten hours       day. At the end  a
of  four months         all
                     the pieces were decomposed, and the plate-glass
especially, consisting      silex and soda, was
                                  of                   some pieces corroded

must have been dissolved, for the apertures of the gauze were in
 some instances closed by a siliceous incrustation, and a small sta
 lactite of silica was found depending from the lowest part. He points
out the bearing of these results on the agency of water under high
pressure on felspathic and other rocks containing alkalies, and in this
 point of view they are of great interest.
    I hail with unfeigned pleasure the arrival of every paper which
makes geology a science not merely of observation, but experiment.
 In the condition in which we stand at present, the geology of the
laboratory is as essential to our progress as that of the open air.
    The Metamorphoses of rocks which are so continually pressed
 upon our notice are capable of explanation by chemists only.                      Of
 those metamorphoses I will only observe, that they appear to me to
 be attributed too exclusively to Plutonic action.               The phaenomena
which startle and delight us in the vicinity of whin dykes, we regard
 in Neptunian rocks without emotion.
    The Account recently published by Professor Hoffmann of the
marble of Carrara is very striking. The result of his examination
  is,that this pure saccharine limestone,             which         trace has been in               no

   Of the Work so honoured by the Royal ScCiety, the third edition
has been lately published: in this edition some opinions formerly
expressed have been modified or renounced, and much new matter
has been introduced ; the phaenomena of springs and Artesian wells
have been more fully treated ; the theory of elevation has been en
tered into more at large, the author still controverting that theory.
A chapter, almost entirely new, points out the probable causes of
volcanic heat; objections are advanced against the doctrine of the
central fluidity of the earth, and especially the intense heat attri
buted by some writers to the internal nucleus.      Mr. Lyell considers
how far chemical   processes in the interior of the earth may generate
volcanic heat, and what may be the effect exerted by currents of
electricity. Sir Humphry Davy's theory of an unoxidated metal
lic nucleus is considered, and it is suggested that compounds re
sulting from the action of water upon metallic bases may be again
deoxidated by the hydrogen set free in that process.       The author
has also given a more complete view of his opinions respecting the
origin of caverns, and the manner in which they have been filled
with breccia and the bones of animals.      In illustrating this sub
ject, he refers particularly to the recent discoveries of MM. Virlet
and Boblaye in the Morea.      His sketch of the principal secondary
 formations is also considerably enlarged.
     Two other publications have issued from the press during the
 last year, which are eminently deserving of your attention.             The
 first of these, entitled “A Treatise on Primary Geology,” originated
 in great measure from a discussion that took place at a Meeting of
 the Geological Section of the British Association at Cambridge, and
 was drawn up with a view to the further consideration of the chief
 questions which it embraces, at the subsequent Meeting of the same
 body at Edinburgh.
    Dr. Boase begins by describing the composition and relation of
 the several Primary Rocks, combining the accounts of geologists in
 various parts of the world with the results of his own laborious in
vestigations in Cornwall. I regret, that within the limits to which            I
am restricted, it is impossible for me to do justice to the merits of
 this important work;       I
                            must confinemy observations to a few of           its
 most characteristic features.      Dr. Boase    is   opinion that the con
                                                       of
nexion between Unstratified and Stratified Rocks shows that they had
a  common and contemporaneous origin.           He observes that granitic
masses are   as   complex     their
                                in  composition       stratified rocks, and
                                                       as
form sometimes distinct     regular beds,  highly  inclined and alternating
with one another; that the elvans,        or

                                     the containing    slate,  and have the
same basis; that the difference between the granite and killas,               or
elvan, in   Cornwall   isoften feebly marked, and still more feebly the
difference between the granite and gneiss         Scotland and Germany;

 responding change, he says, takes place in the slate. The elvans
 are connected on either side with the granite they intersect by the
 most intimate mineral gradations, or contain irregular portions or
 masses of the common granite, with which they coalesce; both
 are penetrated by crystals of felspar; both are striped with shorl.
 At Pednimerer Meer one of the parallel layers of granite runs
 through the elvan. In Scotland different beds of granite will inter
 sect a common mass, and pass by minute mineral transition into one
 another, or into the characteristic granite of the district.
    Dr. Boase considers that the Primitive Shisti are improperly said
 to be stratified. Pini has expressed the same opinion in two sepa
 rate memoirs; the supposed planes of stratification are, in his view
 of the subject, mere transverse fissures. Prof. Phillips, Mr. Scrope,
 Dr. Fleming, Prof. Sedgwick, have                                  all
                                                      felt and expressed the dif.
ficulty    of distinguishing        these shisti planes
                                          in                    cleavage, and planesof

   Dr. Boase remarks that                      all

He says the stratification             rocks  of                     all

the laminae, others neglect them; nay, the same observer shall some
times select     as  strata one series          planes, sometimes another.

not necessarily the effect of disturbance, but are to be attributed, in
the Primary Slates, to original structure, and in many of the Second
ary, partly to this cause, and partly to deposition upon inclined sur
faces.
    The difficulty I have been considering is by no means confined to
Primary Slates. Mr. Conybeare has observed on the coast of Sully,
in Glamorganshire, that the Lias splits spontaneously into blocks of
regular figure, corresponding to that of a crystal of calcareous spar.
If this be the case, where are we to look for the seams of Stratifica
tion? I have felt for very many years, and I still feel, that the
indistinctness of this term is one of the most dangerous stumbling
blocks we have to encounter.           If we would found upon this distinc
tion the   grand  classification of rocks into Neptunian and Plutonic,
surely we ought to have some test by which to determine whether
rocks are stratified or not.          looking If,   the theory      M. Elie

    The Author now gives a general Sketch of the various Rocks that
are known to us; he remarks that the Primary differ chemically from
the Secondary, and endeavours to account for the phaenomena con
nected with animal and vegetable life, as exhibited in the several for
mations, upon the theory of a gradual Loss of Heat by Radiation. Upon
this theory he would explain the Scanty Supply of Limestone in the
earliest Rocks. The effect of great heat would be to expel from water
the carbonic acid necessary to hold the carbonate of lime in solutions;
and consequently Calcareous matter could not be deposited from
heated water.     He observes also that the Conditions for an uniform
distribution of animal and vegetable life, would be more uniform in a
thermal than in our actual Seas, and, therefore, if the Ocean had be
come gradually cooler, we should expect to find, as we do, genera and
 species more diversified.

  In a collection of                 Insects        recently received by the author from
Lima is contained a beautiful series of the one constituting the type
of his proposed new genus
                                               ANCISTRosom A.

     Pedes longissimi, robusti.
     The stoutness of its legs and the sharp lateral          edges of its thorax

                                           the neighbouring genera: the male

spine near the base        the abdomen beneath. Its natural situation

ping over the scutellum,          structure which

      It
       was observed that young of the same species had been born at
 the  Society's   Gardens, but not living; and that a female in the
 collection of the President, the Earl of Derby, at Knowsley, had pro
 duced, about the same time as Lady Rolle's, two living and healthy
 young ones, which are still thriving.
    Mr. Gould exhibited a living specimen of the red-billed Toucan,
 Ramphastos erythrorhynchus, Gmel., which had recently come into
 his possession.
    The exhibition was resumed of the new species of Shells contained
 in the collection of Mr. Cuming. Those brought at the present Meet
 ing under the notice of the Society were accompanied by characters
 by Mr. G. B. Sowerby, which are given in the ‘Proceedings’.
    Genus VENUs.      VEN. Columbiensis, subimbricata, undatella, discre
 pans, multicostata (long. 4:3, lat. 2:7, alt. 37 poll.—perhaps the largest
 species known), Peruviana, Australis, and spurca.
    Genus CYTHERE A. Cyth. radiata (belongs to that division of the
 genus which has four cardinal teeth, and is destitute of the cordiform
 anterior impression), unicolor, concinna, and squalida (bears some re
 semblance to Cyth. maculosa).
    March 10.—Specimens were exhibited of several species of Tro
   on, partly from the Society's collection, and partly from that of
    r. Gould; and, at the request of the Chairman, Mr. Gould called
 the attention of the Meeting to some of the more interesting among
 them.
       of them was the Bird represented by M. Temminck, in his
      One
‘Planches Coloriées", under the name of Trog, fasciatus; and on this
Mr. Gould remarked, that having had an opportunity of examining
 the drawing made by Forster, on which Pennant's original descrip
 tion was founded, he had ascertained that it represented a species
altogether distinct from M. Temminck's Bird, and much more nearly
resembling Trog. Malabaricus.           As the name of Trog, fasciatus
 must necessarily remain with the species originally described under
it,  the one figured    by  M. Temminck requires another designation;
and Mr. Gould proposed for           that
                                     it       Trog. Temminckii.

 Geoff, presented by the writer to the Society, and also adverting
 to his endeavours to obtain the animal, which, from the description
of it given by the Arabs of the Desert, Mr. Willshire conceives
 must be the Antilope Leucorya described by Pennant.
   The exhibition was resumed of the new species of Shells contained
in Mr. Cuming's collection.      Those brought on the present evening
under the notice of the   Society, completed the genera Venus and Cy
therea, which had been commenced at the Meeting on February 24.
The Shells now exhibited were accompanied by characters by Mr.
Broderip and Mr. G. B. Sowerby, which are given in the ‘Proceed
ings’, under the following names:
   VENUs tricolor, histrionica, fusco-lineata, Chilensis, lenticularis, as
perrima, costellata, opaca, variabilis, discors, Cypria (a near relation
to the Linnaean Venus Paphia), crenifera, leucodon, Californiensis,
compta, ornatissima, Mactracea, pulicaria, obscura.
   CYTHEREA lubrica, alternata, tortuosa, affinis (may be a variety of
Cyth. tortuosa), Dione, varr. 3, y, vulnerata, planulata var. suffusa,
argentina, pannosa, pallescens, inconspicua, modesta, pectinata (var.
immaculata).
   Specimens were exhibited of numerous Thrushes, chiefly inhabit
ants of the Himalayan Mountains and of India; and Mr. Gould, at
the request of the Chairman, brought them under the notice of the
Meeting, principally with the view of indicating those of the former
district as constituting a new form in the family Merulidae, Vig., for
which he proposed the generic name
                            IANTHociNcLA.
   Rostrum ferè ut in Cinclosomate et Turdo sed magis robustum :
mandibulá superiore ad basin setigerá.
   Nares basales, ovales, apertae.
  Alae breves, concavae, rotundatae; remigibus 6tà 7mâque longiori
bus, omnibus mollibus.
   Cauda subelongata, concava, rotundata; rectricibus mollibus.
   Tarsi elongati, robusti.
  Hallur digitum medium longitudine subaequans, ungue forti sub
aequali munitus.
  Typus genericus.     Cinclosoma ocellatum, Vig.
  Montium  IIimalaya,   Incolae.
  The chief distinguishing characteristics of the genus Ianthocincla
are the comparative length of the tarsus; the length of the hinder
toe, and the great length of the claw by which it is terminated; the
roundness, concavity, softness, and yielding character of the wings
and tail; and the peculiar fullness, lightness, and downiness of the
whole of the plumage, and particularly of that of the back and rump.
The downy nature of the covering is alluded to in the generic name.
                                                                     -

    April 14.—Mr. Gould, at the request of the Chairman, exhibited,
from the collection of the President, the Earl of Derby, a specimen
of a species of Toucan, which he regarded as hitherto undescribed.
It belongs to the same group with the other grooved-billed Toucans,
and is consequently referrible to the genus recently proposed by
Mr. Gould under the name of Aulacorhynchus. He pointed out the
characters which distinguish it from the other species of the genus,
and proposed for it the name of Aulacorhynchus Derbianus.
   Mr. Gould remarked that the colouring of the extremities of the
tail-feathers would alone suffice to distinguish from each other the
four species at present known in this genus. In Aul. sulcatus the
tips of the tail-feathers are not marked by any peculiar colour: in
Aul. Derbianus, the two, and in Aul. haematopygus, the four, inter
mediate tail-feathers are tipped with brown: while in Aul. prasinus
the whole of the tail-feathers are tipped with brownish red.
   The exhibition was resumed of the hitherto undescribed Shells
contained in the collection of Mr. Cuming.       Those brought at the
present Meeting under the notice of the Society were accompanied
by characters by Mr. G. B. Sowerby.        They consisted of the fol.
lowing    species and varieties of the
     Genus Monoceros.       Mon. imbricatum, var.; crassilabrum, var.
 album; costatum; cymatum, Sow. ; acuminatum (may be only a va
 riety of Mon. imbricatum); Globulus; punctulatum; unicarinatum; and
 citrinum.
    Specimens were exhibited of the following Hymenopterous Insects,
partly from the collection of the Rev. F. W. Hope, and partly from
that of Mr. Westwood.        They were accompanied by characters by
 Mr. Westwood, which are given in the ‘Proceedings’.

I  find the individuals to differ as much in temper as human beings:
 some are willing to take care of the young ones of others, whilst
 some have pursued and killed them, and this whether they had a
 brood of their own or not. Some cocks have assisted in the care of
 young ones, whilst others have attacked them. An early hen fre
 quently has a brood herself the next year. Age makes no difference
 in the number of the brood. I have had six from a hen a year old,
 and one from an old hen. The hens have frequently a great pre

cient for generic characters.    Passing to the characters deriveable
from the combined consideration of the beak and feet, on which
Brisson's system was founded, he remarks on some incongruous
associations which were thereby occasioned. Size, the most conve
nient mode (in his estimation) of distinguishing the Quails from the
Partridges, cannot, he remarks, be admissible as affording adequate
grounds for generic distinction.     Habits, also, present many diffi

 ExPLANATORY FACTs.  BY M.R. STURGEON, LECTURER on Ex
   PERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY AT THE HONOURABLE EAST INDIA
   company’s ACADEMY, ADDISCOMBE.
Pº           APS   a more disagreeable task could             hardly fall to the lot
     of any individual than that of having to rescue from the un
warrantable attack of another, that which is justly and honestly his
own right. And it is more particularly so, when the claim is either
of a literary or a scientific character, where credit alone is but too
generally the humble reward of much industry, anxiety, expendi
ture of money, time, &c.
   I am, at present, however, placed in that unpleasant situation,
and have no means so likely for redress as that of placing a few
facts before the scientific part of the readers of the Philosophical
Magazine.
  By referring to the Number for November last, it will be seen
that I had, some time previously, succeeded in producing electro
 dynamic phaenomena, of various classes, by giving to magnetically
 excited electric currents one uniform direction through the ter
minal conducting wires, by means of a certain contrivance which
 may very properly be called the Unio-directive Discharger; because
 it has the power of uniting, and discharging, in any one direction
those currents which, in consequence of the mode of excitation,
are originally urged, alternately, in directions opposite to each
other.
    Without some arrangement for this purpose, every magnetic
electrometer in which coils of wire form the original source, would
have remained comparatively useless; and those phaenomena, the
most interesting in electro-dynamics,        could never have been pro
duced    by  the  opposing  currents,  however powerful, rushing from
these   copious  sources of electric action.
    To exhibit the spark, heat wires, or to produce the shock, it
matters not in which direction the current flows, nor whether it re
ciprocates, or proceeds in one uniform direction.
    Electro-magnetic phaenomena may also be exhibited by recipro
cating currents, or even by opposing currents, provided the force
in one direction sufficiently predominates over that in the other.
But in the production of chemical decomposition, with exact polar
arrangement of the liberated constituents, it requires that the elec
tric currents be not of a reciprocating character.
    Itis, moreover,  a particular object       the experimenter,
                                              of                     every     in
electro-dynamic process,    to   avail himself     of    as
                                                      much           as
                                                                possible            of
excited electric force; and also        to prevent,     far  as           he
                                                                   can, the
                                                                    as
existence     ofany counteraction whatever.
    Now,      well-constructed magnetic electrometers, the recipro
             in
                                be of
cating currents are nearly        equal force, and the predominancy,                if
any there be, can never           calculated       on   as
                                                         disposable force,
                                                             a
either  as regards  degree or  direction.

    Besides, it would be exceedingly unscientific, in cases, where
 power is wanting, to employ a part only, when the whole is avail
 able; or, as in the present instance, to employ the difference only,
 instead of the sum of the reciprocating electric forces.
    Hence the obvious advantage of the unio-directive discharger,
 which places the whole of the excited force at the disposal of the
 experimenter, and gives to the magnetic electrometer a degree of
importance which it could never have possessed without                                                it.

             it                 by
                            paper    a the Phil. Mag, for March last, that

cation   of  my experiments which were made               the Adelaide Exhi       at         º
bition Rooms, thinking,                    no

some claims which,                  he
                           imagined, were due           himself and Mr.Sax    to
 ton.
I      was well aware, from the best sources             information, that no of

                        I                              ascertaining from Mr. of
Maugham, chemical lecturer, who                kindly assisted me, and also
                                                               so

those produced            by
                       my experiments had ever been known amongst
them.      And     itsingularly fortunate, for the cause
                         is                                         truth, that                  of

I  employed         on
                  that occasion.
    Indeed, the claims               of
                             Mr. Watkins have, from the first reading
of  his paper, appeared       me,     to                  be   of
                                              that futile description which,
                                                     to
in    his ardour      excel,

                                  has himself eventually shown them
 to be.
    The Phil. Mag. for the present month shows very clearly that
Mr. Watkins has not made even the slightest alteration, conse
quently       no
               improvement,        the original apparatus
                                                in                  “Hence,”                     !
says that gentleman, “we have            every slow revolution two actions
                                                      in
and two reactions; one                   of
                              these actions,          true, tends     the same

              as            reactions;    but still we have two directions
of   the current, and these two are antagonizing, therefore we have
no TRUE Polar decomposition,” &c. (p. 111.)

                                     at                                    that                             is

    Very different indeed are the results from the unio-directive
discharger.       Electro-dynamic phaenomena, by this apparatus, are
exhibited from revolving coils, either with or without a ferruginous
nucleus or armature, with the same promptitude, uniformity, and
precision as by any other source hitherto placed in the hands of the
philosopher.
   The experimenter also, by this means, may safely confide in his
predictions, and vary his exhibitions in any way he pleases, as far
as the energy of the currents will permit.              He is thus relieved from
all  those corroding apprehensions and mortifying disappointments,
which must ever molest his efforts, agonize

radius of the curvature of the lens in question.            In like manner the
curvature of the other surface of the lens may be discovered. I have
found this method useful in ascertaining the radii of the surfaces
of lenses forming the eye-piece of telescopes and microscopes, to
which, as they are of ...} foci, it is more particularly applicable.
I have mentioned sealing-wax, as being the material most easily ob
tained for the experiment; but I have found fusible metal to be far
preferable.      In employing this, however, there is some chance of
injuring the lens, in consequence of the greater degree of heat em
ployed.      The mode of using the metal (as in the French method of
forming medallions) is to melt it with as little heat as possible, and
pour it upon a piece of paper; then, as soon as, in cooling, it begins
to get pasty at the edges, to stamp the lens upon it: a tolerably
brilliant mirror will be the result.

                            succIN1c Acid AND ITs combi NAtions.
    M. F. Darcet read to the Academy of Sciences an Essay on the
above subjects.
    MM. Liebig and Wöhler had ascertained by analysis that suc
cinic acid contained only half an atom of water, and that this
proportion appeared indispensable. . This difference from organic
acids, such as lactic acid, which are similar in other respects, was de
serving of being carefully verified; and for this purpose M. Darcet
undertook the requisite experiments. . He observes that common
succinic acid loses a definite quantity of water by sublimation; but
this quantity becomes irregular when it has been rapidly distilled
once or twice, and it loses more, according to the number of di
stillations to which it is subjected, so that it may be obtained in an
anhydrous state.
    The distillation carried on with a substance having great affinity
for water, such as phosphoric acid, is much more rapidly effected
and less of it is decomposed.
    Succinic acid is soluble in water, and much more so in hot than
in cold water; and thus                             its
                                 solutions readily crystallize       cool                                          on

XXVIII.        On a new Method of reducing Lunar Observations
  Jor the Determination of the Longitude. By CHARLEs
   RUMKER, Esq., F.R.A.S."
To Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Macdougall Brisbane, K.C.B.,
                   F.R.S. L. & E., F. Ast. S., &c.
      SIR,
THE       lively interest which you took in the determination of
     the longitude    by lunars, and the success which attended
your observations, prompt me to propose to you the following
method of their reduction, which admits of greater accuracy
when either altitude is low.      Already when I had the honour
of accompanying you on      your   passage to New South Wales, I
had an opportunity of remarking the necessity of a more cor
rect allowance for the refraction of the lower object. This
subject has since been resumed by a celebrated astronomer,
whose method appears to me, however, not likely to be ge
nerally adopted by seafaring men, requiring, moreover, a par
ticular ephemeris, which becomes inapplicable under ordinary
circumstances, where the usual methods are sufficiently cor
rect. I trust, therefore, that the following method, which re
quires no other ephemeris than the Nautical Almanac, and
may, as circumstances require, be computed with more or less
precision, will be found of more practical utility.
   The object of the present lines is the correction of the error
committed in the usual methods of clearing the apparent       di
stance between sun and moon by taking out the refractions

242                  Mr.        Rumker's new Method                   of reducing
for their central altitudes, whereas it is the refraction of those
points of their limbs whereof the distance is actually measured
that should be used in the calculation.       As introduction, it
may not be useless to remind, that the usual methods of
clearing the distance, which suppose the altitudes known by
observation, can be classed in direct and approximatory ones.
For as       all
               the former methods are derived from the equation
existing between the sides                       of

XXIX.               Observations      relative to the Structure and Origin of
  the Diamond.                    By SIR DAvid BREwsTER, K.G. H. LL.D.

INEdinburgh
   the year    1820                    I
                        communicated to the Royal Society of
                an account of a very singular fact relative to
the structure of the diamond, and added to this communica           I
tion some conjectures respecting the origin of this remarkable
gem. As these conjectures have been referred to by some late
and able writers on the diamond mines of India without suffi
ciently separating the fact from the conjectures, and as I con
sider the structure which I discovered around the cavities in
this mineral as a leading fact in the natural history of this
gem, I have been induced to re-examine it with care, and to
make a drawing of the phaenomena which it presents.
    In order to bring                      all
                             the facts into one view,        shall make                         I
no   apology   for quoting   my  original observations.

    “When Sir Isaac Newton compared the refractive power
of   several bodies, he remarked that amber and the diamond
had    a refractive power three times greater           respect    their              in                     of
densities than several other        substances,   and       conjectured                         he
that the diamond was probably             unctuous substance coagu an
lated. This relation between the inflammability              bodies and                           of
 their absolute refractive power         had      opportunity  I    con    an                                of

                                ascertaining that sulphur and phos
phorus exceed even the diamond             absolute refractive power,

     “In this arrangement, amber stood next diamond; and                                   to

246                  Sir David Brewster on the Structure
air within both substances, the expansive force of which has
communicated a polarizing structure to the parts in immediate
contact with the air. This structure is displayed in four sec
tors of polarized light encircling the globule of air, and can
be produced artificially either in glass or in gelatinous masses
by a compressing force propagated circularly from a point.    It
is obvious that such an effect cannot arise from any mode of
crystallization; and if any proof of this were necessary, it
might be sufficient to state that I have never observed the
slightest trace of it in more than 200 mineral substances which
I  have examined, nor in any of the artificial salts from aqueous
solutions.     It can, therefore, arise only from the expansive
force exerted by the included air in the diamond and the am
ber, when they were in such a soft state as to be susceptible
of compression from so small a force. That this compressible
state of the diamond could not arise from the action of heat
is manifest from the nature and recent formation of the soil in
which it is found; that it could not exist in a mass formed by
aqueous deposition is still more obvious; and hence we are
led to the conclusion rendered probable by other analogies,
that the diamond originates, like amber, from the consolida
tion  of, perhaps, vegetable matter, which gradually acquires                                 a
crystalline form          by
                         the influence                 of
                                            time, and the slow action
of  corpuscular forces.

monds, which did not seem           have been regularly crystallized,

crystal the same structure which            had observed

 248            Sir David Brewster on the Structure
 fore conclude my paper by expressing a hope that this im
portant mineral may meet with more able investigation.”
    This discovery of a new matrix of the diamond takes away
 the foundations of the argument from which             I concluded
 “ that the compressible state of the diamond could not arise
from heat,” for it is possible that the rocky matrix in which it
 was found had an igneous origin; and Captain Franklin's
 supposition that it might be fused under compression, is quite
 conceivable.            -   -
    But, though   I admit the possibility of the diamond having
been in a state of igneous fusion,      I consider it highly impro
bable that it was so.      In the laborious examination, which     I
 carried on for several years, of the cavities in topaz, quartz,
 amethyst, chrysoberyl, &c., and in salts formed from aqueous
solutions, I had occasion to observe the condition of many
 thousands of cavities, and in no one case, neither in crystals
 which exist in rocks known to be of igneous origin, nor in
crystals artificially formed, have I been able to discover a
single cavity in which the expansible fluid which it contained
had compressed the surrounding mass, and communicated to
it the polarizing structure existing around the cavities in the
diamond.
    Now, in glass which is known to have been in a soft state,
and in amber, which is generally allowed to be an indurated
gum,   I have discovered cavities similar to those in the dia
mond, and surrounded by the same polarizing structure; a
structure which could only be produced by a compressing
force emanating from these cavities.
    As I am desirous that mineralogists should thoroughly un
derstand the nature of this structure, I have made two draw
ings of the diamond Laske which contains the cavities under
consideration.

At a and b are seen two minute cavities, which appear per
fectly black, as if they were filled with opake matter. This
blackness, however, arises from the high refraction which
takes place at the concave surfaces of the cavity, as may be
proved by the application of a microscope, which exhibits a
minute pencil of light transmitted through them. Fig. 2.
shows the four luminous sectors around each cavity, as ex
hibited by the agency of polarized light.               When a plate of

    The existence of a compressed structure round the cavities
 clearly proves that the diamond has been in a soft state; but
 it may be shown, from various considerations, that this soft
 ness was not the softness produced by igneous fusion, and
that it is likely to have been the softness of a semi-indurated
gum.          I
           have already stated that no such cavities exist in
minerals of igneous origin; a fact which entitles us to separate

 as about 400, it seems to me we have no alternative but to at
 tribute the difference between these two measurements to the
gain of the land upon the sea during the intervening period
 of 2160 years.” Surely 2064 miles from a town on any road
or river is plain enough. Nearchus then sailed on the gulf
 up to about the present town of Simauvu, where he found
 Diridotis, and about the present town of Duffas on the                                                        Ti

of vapour carried off, and also of the air which carries away
 this moisture, otherwise the instrument could not remain sta

260    Dr. Hudson's Method for inferring the Dew-point
 portion) what number of degrees dry air should fall at any
 other temperature of the hygrometer on the supposition that
 air in sinking a given number of degrees (at those different
 temperatures) gives out the same quantity of heat in each
 case, from a given volume.      If this be not so, we must allow
 for it in the manner to be hereafter mentioned. To try the
 amount of effect of dry air at different temperatures on wet
 bulb hygrometer, I would propose to pass air (well dried by
 muriate of lime) from a gasometer through a tube which could
 be heated to different degrees at pleasure, and in the con
 tinuation of this tube (made of glass) to suspend a thermome
 ter and wet-ball hygrometer, so as to be equally exposed to
 current of air, and note the temperature of each (in a tabular
 form) as the temperature of air varied. The current should
 be rapid, and the source of heat large, so that temperature
 should alter slowly.     There should be various precautions
 adopted, which          I fill
                          not dwell on here.
    3tio. In order to ascertain the value (in degrees of Fahren
heit) of the proportional numbers, we may evidently use the
 formula “V : V          –
                      d :: moisture of saturation at tempera
ture of hygrometer: moisture of saturation at dew-point,” by
conjoint observations of both hygrometer and dew-point.
Thus, suppose (for example) that thermometer marks 100°
and hygrometer 61°, and dew-point found by observation
 = 52°408, then (by inverting former formula) we have
“moisture of saturation at 61°; moisture of saturation at
52°408: moisture of saturation at 61°::(100–61) 39: 51° 124
= V, the fall in dry air corresponding to temperature 61° of
hygrometer.
    Having tried Daniel's hygrometer (with this view), I doubt
whether we can attain (through this or similar instru
ments) a knowledge of the actual dew-point without being
liable to an error of, perhaps, a degree or more, at the ordi
mary temperatures of the dew-point in these countries. It must
be evident from the very small differences of the saturating
weights of moisture (in a cubic foot of air) at the ordinary
temperatures of the dew-point, where the temperature alters
one degree, that the amount deposited in a short time can
hardly be perceptible to our senses.        For instance, suppose
the point of saturation is 58° and that temperature is reduced
to 57°, the quantities of saturation          (in
                                             cubic foot) are 5.492

  262      Dr. Hudson's Method for inferring                    the Dew-point
  that tº has been accurately ascertained, it would evidently fol
 low that the values of V thus found for different temperatures
 of the hygrometer should be proportional to the numbers
 I  have given in the table (4th column), unless “a given vo
 lume of air of different temperatures under 30 pressure has
 different capacities for heat.”  Hence this very desirable                       in
 formation    may   be obtained   conjointly  with the values of
 V under that pressure. Also, if the same experiments be
 repeated under a different atmospheric pressure (say 28), we
 find the values of V for various temperatures of hygro
 meter; and if variation of pressure (the temperature being
 the same) makes a difference in the capacity of air” estimated by
 volume, we find the amount of that difference at the different
 temperatures of the hygrometer, and of course obtain another
 valuable addition to our knowledge. The latter point may also
 be elucidated in the following manner, viz., by covering the
balls of a good differential thermometer with linen, and at
 known temperatures (when pressure varies) wetting one of
the balls with some volatile liquid (spirits of turpentine, for
example,) whose evaporation will not cause sufficient coldt to
produce a deposition of dew (which might disturb the process
by the latent heat of the vapour deposited). We may thus as
certain what effect change of density produces on the capa
city of air estimated by volume, when the other circumstances
of the experiment are perfectly similar.—Experiments on the
depression of temperature produced by the evaporation of
this and other volatile liquids, may (I need hardly add) be

contained in this paper to my friend Dr. Apjohn two or three days after
he communicated his method to the Royal             Academy, and I have re
cently had the pleasure to learn from him that he has employed both the
methods of experimenting      on dry air, and on air of a known dew-point
(heated artificially), with the view of testing and establishing the correct
mess of his own formula: this (of course), from the reasons mentioned, I am

     P.S. Since the addition of the last page,     as well as of
the note on page 259, it has occurred to me that the for
mula V:         V–d::
                   moisture of saturation at hygrometer tem
perature : moisture of saturation at dew-point, ought to be
altered to V:       V-d:: f'(tension of vapour at hygrometer
temperature):       f"
                   (tension of vapour at dew-point). The former
is true of a given volume of vapour cooled (with diminution
of elasticity) without alteration of density, as in the case of
vapour cooled in a tube hermetically sealed.       The latter re
fers to the case where a given volume of vapour (cooled)                         in
creases in density (preserving the same elasticity), and is more
applicable to the actual state of the atmosphere.      In this re
spect, therefore, Dr. Apjohn's point of view was more correct.
And it would appear to me that our methods would in this
case be perfectly alike, the difference only consisting in Dr.
Apjohn's obtaining his value of V from theoretical views on
which       I
          have no reliance.     It would appear, however, that
Dr.   Apjohn  does not view the matter in this light, as he has
had the kindness recently to communicate to me the following
                                                                  If
                                                             f
                                                   V be the de
proportion as derived from his views, viz.
pression in dry, and d in moist air,          the elastic force of
j'
vapour at stationary temperature of hygrometer in dry, and
    in moist air, and           f"
                            the elastic force at dew-point of the
latter, then, he states that
                         V:    d::f                f" +f 7–f",
instead     of being,     as   I    conceive it should be,
                               V : d::f : f'          – f';
in fact, his proportion would make d greater than V.                             Of
course, the terms f" and                      f"

XXXII.          Erperimental Investigation of a Formula for                                   in
     Jerring    the Dew-point from the Indications                          of the    Wet-bulb
     Hygrometer.    By JAMEs APJohn, M.D., Professor                                   of Che
     mistry in the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland.*
A".I the meeting of the Academy held in November last,
     was permitted to read   short memoirt on the subject
                                             a
of a formula, at which I had       a considerable time previously
arrived, for inferring the dew-point from the indications of
the moist-bulb hygrometer.        This formula was deduced alto
gether from general considerations, and, though satisfied from
some hasty observations of my own that it represented facts
with considerable accuracy, I was not, at the time, in posses
sion of evidence which could be considered as establishing
this important point in an unequivocal manner. The table
which is subjoined to my paper undoubtedly shows that,
within certain limits, my formula is in accordance with expe
riment; but the observed depressions in the table are, generally
speaking, so small, that a formula in itself incorrect might, it
must be admitted, yield results which would deviate from the
observed dew-points, by quantities not exceeding the possible
errors of observation.      Berzelius, for example, states (Traité
de  Chimie,  tom. viii. 6. 254.) that from the experiments of Au
gust, Bohnenberger, and others, it appeared that the tempera
ture of a thermometer, with moistened bulb, was an arithmetic
mean between that of the air and the dew-point; and this rule,
which would make t'= 2 t'—t, though utterly erroneous,
would apply to the table appended to my paper nearly as well
as the formula I have deduced.           The validity, therefore, of
my method required to be more rigorously tested, and having
been for some time engaged in experimental researches insti
tuted with this object, which have led to interesting, and to
me most satisfactory results, I am anxious to submit them with
as little delay as possible to the judgement of the Academy.
   The equation which, as I believe, comprehends the theory
of the wet-bulb hygrometer is as follows:

  The numbers in column (6.) are the dew-points calculated
by my formula; and while there is an almost exact corre
spondence between the first and the result of experiment, the
second, it will be seen, is higher than the observed tempera
ture of deposition by nearly three degrees.     There is here,
however, obviously some mistake.      It is impossible that with
the recorded temperatures of air and hygrometer the dew
point could have been so low; and this conclusion I do not
at present draw from my theoretical views, for that would be
to subject myself to the imputation of arguing in a circle, but
from the following observation made by me with great care
on the 22nd of March.
                                    t                              d

   Here the temperatures t and t' differ from those taken from
the Encyclopaedia only by about half a degree, and neverthe
less the observed dew-point 44 is higher than 39.5 by 4.5 de
grees.   From these observations, therefore, I am, conceive,                                            I
entitled to conclude, 1st, that the series in which the depres
sion amounts to 15°2, being in exact accordance with my
formula, lends it some degree of support; and 2ndly, that my
method cannot be considered as impugned by the other
series, in as much as this is in some particular manifestly incor
rect. But it is time to enter upon the experimental tests to
which I have resorted.

    The results exhibited in the preceding tables will, be
 lieve, be considered by many as going
                                                                                                 I
                                          far towards establishing
 the accuracy of my theoretical views. Although the depres
 sions vary from 4°7 to 28°5, the differences between the ob
 served dew-points and those deduced from the formula are
 certainly not greater than what may fairly
                                                be ascribed to un
 avoidable inaccuracy of observation.      But for the purpose of
 putting this matter in a still clearer point
                                               of view, I have cal
 culated a number of values of m, the constant of our formula,
 from the preceding observations.      This was easily done; for
 as all the observations in the same table refer to air in the
 same hygrometrical state, each series should give
                                                          the same
 dew-point,            and the expression

remarkably close. Indeed, the difference, which is less than
three in the fourth place of decimals, is so small that they may
be substituted indiscriminately for each other without the oc
currence, at least in ordinary cases, of sensible error.     Had
values of m been calculated from the comparison alone of the
first series of observations in each table, with the subsequent
ones, the mean, it is worthy of remark, would be 01156, or
almost exactly ºr ; and as, for such observations,        f', and     F–
D—d are     necessarily  greatest, they are best calculated to af
ford correct results, since any error of experiment would ob
viously in their case exercise the least influence.

                               º     .    Hence by determining experimen
tally the depression of the hygrometer in perfectly dry air, we
shall be able to pronounce upon the validity of the general me
thod under discussion.
   The first attempts for determining values of d experi
mentally, consisted in suspending a pair of thermometers, one
of which had its bulb moistened, in a close-corked bottle, the
bottom of which was covered with a stratum of oil of vitriol ;
but this method was soon abandoned, as the depressions it
afforded were, on an average, one fifth less than they should
be according to the formula.        In fact, the extreme depression
could not be    expected   here,   for it is obvious that the air in
contact with the bulb of the moist thermometer is never per
fectly dry except at the very commencement of the experi
Inent.
    The next contrivance to which I resorted was as follows:
A bag of India-rubber cloth, furnished with a cap and
stopcock, was inflated by a bellows, and thus connected
means of a caoutchouc collar to a glass tube traversing a cor
fitted to the tubulure of the lower bottle of a Nooth's appa
                                                                                 .

two thirds with        oilvitriol, and the pair
                             of                              of

the equivalent of the upper green-sand or fºrestone; and the
gray bed that of the chalk-marl; but I find the characteristic
fossils of the upper green-sand, and chalk-marl so intermingled
in the gray bed, that it is impossible to draw a line of de
marcation               those two strata; and from this circum
                   between
 stance we are led to infer that at the epoch when the upper
green-sand and chalk-marl of Wiltshire and Devonshire were
 depositing, and the then existing marine Testaceae were en
 tombed, similar phaenomena were in progress in this portion of
 the great chalk basin; but the material supplied being more
 cretaceous, the strata consequently exhibited a dissimilar mi
 neralogical character.     The lowest of these beds (No. 4, of
 the section of Hunstanton Cliff) reposes upon the thin seam
 of dark red argillaceous matter (described page 181), which
separates it from the red limestone or gault equivalent. The
 texture of this bed varies, some portions of it being very
loose, others exceedingly hard and compact;                substance          its                       is

marl at Sandringham is of nearly as dark a shade as that of
Hunstanton; and in it are found the same Ammonites, and
Pecten Beaveri and orbicularis.
   The same bed at Shouldham has a lighter shade, and has
many ochraceous stains: at this locality blocks of an exceed
ingly hard nature are irregularly distributed through the softer
marl; their solidity defies the blows of the quarrymen, and
they are not convertible into lime by the heat of the kiln.

shells common to the lowest beds of chalk.

 278         Mr. Rose's        Sketch     of the Geology of West Norfolk.
 more than five yards in the mile. At Sedgeford, where hill
 and vale are abruptly formed, the chalk is remarkably frac
 tured, although the strata are but little displaced.
    The thickness of the “chalk without flints,” exposed at
 Hunstanton cliff, is 28 feet: the same bed including the gray
 chalk is found to be 60 feet in the well at Diss.
    Mineral Contents.-A few small nodules of dull white flint
 are interspersed through this bed, particularly in the upper
 portion.    Crystallized carbonate of lime is at present only
 found  lining the interior of Echini and Terebratulae. Metalli
 ferous substances are of rare occurrence, and consist of amor
 phous iron pyrites; hydrate of iron partaking of the form of a
 septarium, as casts of Echini, and as an ochrey powder depo
 sited between the natural separations of the chalk; the black
 oride of manganese is very generally scattered through the
 chalk of Western Norfolk in minute scales, and in dendritic
 forms: at the large pits in Congham,       found it also in thin       I
 seams, deposited in the vertical and horizontal partings of the
 chalk, and frequently mingled with the oxide of iron. In this
 county, the green particles (silicate of iron) usually found
 in the lower chalk of the southern counties, are not met
 with.

     THE       contributions to science received at the annual meet
           ings of the British Association are of two classes,—the one
     consisting of reports and researches executed under its im
     mediate impulse and direction, the other of miscellaneous
     communications, the authors of which choose this method of
     bringing new facts or theories into notice, and of submitting
     them to public discussion.
        Without undervaluing in any degree the latter class of con
     tributions, the Association deems it advisable to deal with
     them in such a manner as to avoid any interference with the
     Transactions of other Institutions: with this view it has dis
     couraged the production, at          meetings,      its
                                                         papers        state    of                  in

and accompanying them in their voyages as their host; the
kindred spirit evinced by the Directors of the Dublin and
Kingstown rail-road, who provided gratuitous conveyance
from the coast to the capital; the splendid entertainments
given in the Zoological and Botanic Gardens; the hospitali
ties of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, and of
that illustrious academical body on which rested the chief
charge and credit of receiving the Association; the partici

pation in these festivities of the Representative of the Sove
reign, and the happy manner in which he seized the occa
 sion of conferring a public mark of distinction on the highly
 gifted mathematician and astronomer who held office as one
 of the Secretaries of the Meeting;—in addition to these open
testimonies of respect for scientific pursuits, the silent under
current of refined and invisible hospitality by which the guests
of Ireland found their expenses contracted and their cheer
enhanced, all these were indeed but collateral circumstances
 attending that meeting, and managed in such a manner as to
 interfere with none of its                  labours; but they were
 not ineffective in  kindling    a warmth of feeling by which the
 powers of the mind are capable of being invigorated even in
 the pursuit of abstract truth. The moral calm, too, which the
 meeting seemed to communicate,_the suspension of every
 feeling but that of a common interest in promoting the know
 ledge of nature, this, in like manner, was but an incidental
 circumstance, yet it raised thoughts of the usefulness as well
  as the dignity of those studies which possess a charm not only
 to elevate the individual but to bind the species together.
    Reflections of this kind, which crowd upon the mind on
 such occasions, and which the meeting at Dublin excited in
 a peculiar degree, contribute their share to that general effect
 of which Professor Hamilton gave so eloquent a description
 in his preliminary address, whilst asserting the power of so
 cial sympathy over the most private moments of exertion in
 the secret retirements of science. “We meet, we speak, we
 feel,” said the Professor, “together now, that we may here
 after the better think and act and feel alone. The excitement
 with which the         airfilled will not pass
                              is                     once away; the

homes and oracular places of science be our allotted place of
                                      I
labour till we meet together again, am persuaded that those
influences will operate upon us all, that we shall all remember
this our present meeting, and look forward with joyful expec
tation to our next reassembling, and by the recollection and
the hope be stimulated and supported.”
 - Highly, however, and justly as we prize the social and sym
pathetic ardour of mind which these meetings spontaneously
produce, we must not confine our views to this object in such a
manner as to propose to dispense with more direct endea            -
vours to effect the advancement of science. On this subject
some remarks were offered by Mr. Harcourt, at the close of
his statement of the Recommendations of the Committee and
of the appropriation of certain sums to scientific purposes.
    After adverting to some remarkable instances which had
come to his knowledge of the actual effect of these meetings
in awaking the dormant spirit of science, and enumerating
among the indirect benefits that arise from them the means
which they supply to persons whose merits have been ob
scured by accidental circumstances, of vindicating their own
rightful claims, and of repelling that false and partial criti
cism by which genius had in former days been too often de
pressed, he proceeded to say, “After all, every important
advantage which these meetings possess, and, above all, the
maintenance in them of the true principles and character of
 philosophical investigation, will entirely depend on the con
tinued presence and concurrence of the master-spirits of
 science; and it must be remembered that these are the per
 sons whose attendance, from the value of their time, it is
 most difficult to secure. From the first commencement of
 the Association I have always held that there is but one mo
 tive strong enough to tear those persons from their retire
 ments and to bind them to these annual meetings.         If you
 here offer to them the direct and acknowledged means of ad
 vancing the science to which they are attached, if you assist
 the astronomer in effecting the reduction of the elements of
 his calculations, if you establish for the meteorologist a
 system of conjoint and extended observations from which the
 laws of the atmosphere may be deduced,—with such objects
 before them, the greater mastery they may possess in science
 the more eager will be the interest which they take in your
 meetings, and the more probable it is that you will enjoy the
 advantage of their counsel, and the communication of their
 spirit, than which there is nothing more essential to give life
  and consistence to your proceedings.”
    This we are persuaded is      vital principle on
                             2
                              !";P2
                                                       which the

292    British Association for the Advancement   of Science,
permanence of the Association depends. Should it ever be
lost sight of, should the resources of the institution come to
be expended chiefly on subordinate objects, and its recom
mendations directed to little points, instead of the great
questions which interest men of comprehensive views in the
different departments of science, the consequence will be that
the meetings will be left entirely to men of second-rate ac
quirements, and that they will speedily fall into contempt.
   We have reason to hope that the next volume of the Trans
actions of the Association, which we are informed will soon
appear, may bear evidence of a continued attention to this
principle ; in the mean time the answer contained in Mr.
 Hamilton's address to the objection of a writer in the Edin
burgh Review against the exercise of the influence of the
Association in obtaining from the Government a grant of
money for the reduction of observations on the sun, moon,
and planets, made at Greenwich by Bradley and his succes
sors, sufficiently shows how judiciously it has commenced its
operations. The astronomer royal of Ireland informs us that
the particular undertaking thus objected to has afforded the
most unmixed gratification to those cultivators of science
who are interested in the progress of the highest department
of astronomy, and he quotes the opinion of Bessel to the
following effect: “To me, considering all these things toge
ther, it appears to be of the highest moment towards our fu
ture progress in the knowledge of the solar system, to reduce
into catalogues, as conveniently as can be done, according to
one common system of elements, the places of all the planets
observed since 1750; than which labour         I believe that no
other now will be of   greater  use to astronomy.”
   We must refer to the Reports of the Association for
further proofs, in discussions of tables of the tides and other
important investigations, that there is no want of enlarged
views in its Recommendations and in the expenditure of its
now considerable funds.      As long as this continues to be the
case we have no doubt that, meet where it will, its meetings
will attract a large proportion of those who are sincerely
devoted to science for its own sake, and who have a just un
derstanding of the spirit in which it is to be pursued and
the methods by which it is to be advanced.
   Nor does there seem to be any reason to fear that the want
of a locality for such assemblages will be found to place an
impediment in their way. At the late meeting there were
deputies present from five of the chief commercial towns in
England to invite the Association and to offer suitable ac
commodation in their respective towns.        Bristol stood first

them in one tree capable of being coordinated with a contempora                        s
neous series in another, by means of these irregularities, it was
shown to be possible to arrive at an accurate knowledge of the age
of trees in which life had become extinct, or which had been long
enveloped in peat bogs, provided a sufficient number of trees of in
termediate ages, which had been subject to the same irregularities
of annual growth, could be examined. The bearing of the inquiry
on historical records of seasons and on geological speculations was
pointed out, and the process which it would be most convenient to
pursue in the application of the method clearly indicated.

    M’CULLAGH.
    To understand the nature of the general problem which a com
plete theory of double refraction requires to be solved, let it be sup
posed that a ray of light is reflected and refracted at the separating
surface of an ordinary medium and a doubly refracting crystal,
the light passing out of the former medium into the latter.        This
limited view of the subject is taken merely for the sake of clearness
of conception; since we might suppose that both media are crystal
lized, without increasing the difficulty of the problem. The question,
it is obvious, naturally divides itself into two distinct heads. The
first relates to the laws of the propagation of light in the interior of
either of the two media, before or after it has passed their separating
surface; and this part of the subject has been fully treated, accord
ing to their different methods, by MM. Fresnel and Cauchy.          The
second division of the subject had been left completely untouched.
It relates to the more complex consideration of what takes place at
 the separating surface of the media, the laws according to which
 the light is there divided between the reflected and refracted rays,
including a determination of the attendant circumstances indicated
by the wave theory, with regard to the vibrations in the reflected
and refracted rays. In the case above mentioned, when the incident
light is polarized, there are four things to be determined, namely,
 the magnitude and direction of the reflected vibration, with the mag
 nitudes of the two refracted vibrations.    The four conditions neces
 sary for this determination are furnished by two new laws, which
 could not be easily stated without entering too much into detail.
 The results, applied to determine the polarizing angle of a crystal
 in different azimuths of the plane of reflection, agree very closely
 with the admirable experiments of Sir David Brewster on Iceland
 spar.    In the course of these experiments it was observed that the
 polarizing angle remained the same when the crystal was turned half
 round(through an angle of 180°), although the inclination of the re
 fracted rays to the axis of the crystal was thereby greatly changed.
 This remarkable fact is a consequence of the theory.        After some
 complicated substitutions in the primary equations, the value of the
 polarizing angle is found to contain only even powers of the sine or
 cosine of the azimuth of the plane of reflection, and therefore a
 change of 180° in the azimuth produces no change in the polarizing
 angle.

   The two new laws above mentioned, on which the theory de
pends, occurred to the author in the beginning of last December;
but, owing to an oversight in forming one of the equations, they
were not fully verified until the beginning of June.
   In this theory it is supposed that the vibrations of polarized light
are parallel to the plane of polarization, according to the opinion of
M. Cauchy. This is contrary to the views of Fresnel, whose theory
of double refraction obliged him to adopt the hypothesis that the
vibrations are perpendicular to the plane of polarization.               It is
further supposed, that the density of the vibrating aether is the same
in both media; and this hypothesis of a constant density in different
media, which was found necessary for the theory, seems to accord,
better than the supposition of a varying density, with the phaenomena
of astronomical aberration.
       If
       we conceive the three principal indices of refraction for the
crystal to become equal, we shall obtain the solution of a very simple
case of the general problem with which we have been occupied,—
the case of an ordinary refracting medium, such as glass. This
simple case, it is well known, was solved by Fresnel.              The fore
going theory leads to a simple law, expressing                         all
                                                           the particulars                         of
the case, but differing with regard         the magnitude

by saying that the refracted vibration        the resultant  is  the incident     of
and reflected vibrations; the first vibration being the diagonal                                  of

    the more complete, as the experiment was made by M. Melloni with
    a different view.
       It is thus now established beyond question, that luminous hot
    bodies are sending out two distinct sorts of heat, or two distinct
    heating agents, at the same time, differing in their properties and
    mode of operation.
       Hence the whole series of results of M. Melloni must be inter
    preted with reference to this distinction, and possibly the considera
    tion of it may remove some of the apparent anomalies.
       Another question of importance which has occurred to the author
    is this, Whether, in the polarization apparatus, supposing one glass
    or pile of mica heated, it will radiate the same quantity of heat to
    the other in the two rectangular positions.    The question is purely
    a mathematical one, and has been in some degree considered, at the
    author's suggestion, by Mr. Murphy, of Cambridge.         The integra
.   tion has not been   completed,
    there will be a difference.

       For the purpose of repeating Leslie's experiments with variations
    of the temperatures of the surface of the mirror and of the thermo
    meter, the author procured a parabolic zinc mirror with a hollow
    back, so that           its

  On the Prismatic Decomposition     of Electrical Light.     By Professor
                               WHEATstone.
     The following is a brief notice of the principal results stated in this
  communication: 1. The spectrum of the electro-magnetic spark
  taken from mercury consists of seven definite rays only, separated
 by dark intervals from each other; these visible rays are two orange
 lines close together, a bright green line, two bluish green lines
 near each other, a very bright purple line, and, lastly, a violet line.
 The observations were made with a telescope furnished with a mea
 suring apparatus; and to ensure the appearance of the spark inva
 riably in the same place, an appropriate modification of the electro
 magnet was employed.        2. The spark taken in the same manner
 from zinc, cadmium, tin, bismuth, and lead, in the melted state,
 É.      similar results; but the number, position, and colours of the
   ines varies in each case; the appearances are so different, that, by
 this mode of examination, the metals may be readily distinguished
 from each other.      A table accompanied the paper, showing the po
 sition and colour of the lines in the various metals used.            The
 spectra of zinc and cadmium are characterized by the presence of a
 red line in each, which occurs in neither of the other metals. 3. When
 the spark of a voltaic pile is taken from the same metals still in the
 melted state, precisely the same appearances are presented. 4. The
 voltaic spark from mercury was taken successively, in the ordinary
 vacuum of the air-pump, in the Torricellian vacuum, in carbonic
 acid gas, &c., and the same results were obtained as when the expe
 riment was performed in the air or in oxygen gas. The light, there
fore, does not arise from the combustion of the metal. Professor
 Wheatstone also examined, by the prism, the light which accompa
nies the ordinary combustion of the metals in oxygen gas and by
other means, and found the appearances totally dissimilar to the
above. 5. Fraunhofer having found that the ordinary electric spark
examined by a prism presented a spectrum crossed by numerous
bright lines, Professor Wheatstone examined the phaenomena in dif
ferent metals, and found that these bright lines differ in number and
position in every different metal employed.      When the spark is taken
between balls of dissimilar   metals,  the lines appertaining  to both are
simultaneously seen.      6. The peculiar phaenomena observed in the
voltaic spark taken between different metallic wires connected with
a powerful battery were then described, and the paper concluded
with a review of the various theories which have been advanced to
explain the origin of electric light.       Professor Wheatstone infers
from his researches, that electric light results from the volatilization
and ignition (not combustion) of the ponderable matter of the con
ductor itself; a conclusion closely resembling that arrived at by
Fusinieri from his experiments on the transport of ponderable mat
ter in electric discharges.

The following fact seems to favour the idea of a sensible influence.
A sound produced under glass, (for instance, the ticking of a French

   included in their natural series of harmonics, and it being pos
   sible that the suppression of the proper vibrations of the shorter
   tube resulted not from the ordinary principle of interference
   but from being forced into unison with the longer one, Professor
   Kane endeavoured to obtain a system in which the whole series
   of neither tubes should be suppressed, but that certain notes
   should be absorbed from the series of each. In only one case did
   he succeed, but in that one the result is very satisfactory.         A

     It was the object of these inquiries to assist in bringing to per
fection the theory of Hydrodynamics, and ascertain the causes of
certain anomalous facts in the resistance of fluids, so as to reduce
 them under the dominion of known laws.
     The resistance of fluids to the motion of floating vessels is found
in practice to differ widely from theory, being, in certain cases,
double or triple of what theory gives, and in other and higher
velocities, much less. These deviations have now been ascertained
to follow two simple and very beautiful lan's : 1st, A law giving a

of the  velocity and magnitude of a wave propagated through the

hend the anomalous    facts, and lead to the following
                                                     Results.
   1. That the resistance of a fluid to the motion of a floating body
will rapidly increase as the velocity of the body rises towards the
velocity of the wave, and will become greatest when they approach
nearest to equality.
   2. That when the velocity of the body is rendered greater than
that due to the nave, the motion of the body is greatly facilitated:
it remains poised on the summit of the wave in a position which
may be one of stable equilibrium ; and this effect is such that at a
velocity of 9 miles an hour the resistance is less than at a velocity
of 6 miles behind the wave.
   3. The velocity of the wave is independent of the breadth of the
fluid and varies with the square root of the depth.
   4. It is established that there is in every navigable stream a cer
tain velocity at which it will be more easy to ascend the river against
the current than to descend with the current.     Thus, if the current
flow at the rate of one mile an hour in a stream 4 feet deep, it will
be easier to ascend with a velocity of 8 miles an hour on the wave
than to descend with the same velocity behind the wave.
   5. That vessels may be propelled on the summit of waves at the
rate of between 20 and 30 miles an hour.

            On Electrical Attraction.    By W. S.Now HARRIs.
    The object of this paper was to examine      the operation of attrac
 tion in  electricity, and the laws and differences between the force of
 attraction actually exerted between two bodies, and the force excited
 in a neutral uninsulated body, by the influence of a charged body
acting upon it at a distance.         He endeavoured to show that the
 former force varied in an inverse ratio of the distance simply ; that
 the law of the inverse square of the distance, which is the general
law for the former force, does not obtain at all distances between
 bodies, except one of them be uninsulated and neutral; and that in all
 cases of attraction there are two previous forces to be considered,
 1st, the force directly induced in the neutral body; 2nd, the effect
 of this induced force upon the charged body; which last he calls
 the reflected force, and attempted to prove that the whole attrac
 tive force between these bodies varies with these forces conjointly,
 so that if one of them becomes fixed it varies with the other.       He
 exhibited and described several new experiments in electricity re
 lating to electrical induction and attraction, and expressed his opi
 nion that the whole attractive force was dependent on the action
 excited in the neutral bodies reflected on the charged body.       This
principle, with but little modification, he further applied to any case
of electrical attraction whatever.
 On the Application of the Proof Plane and Torsion Balance to         in
              quiries in Electricity.   By W. S.Now HARRIs.
    Mr. Harris      conceives that an insulated plate of metal of small
thickness may take up unequal quantities of electricity from a body
and yet the distribution be uniform. The experiments in illustration
 of this were fully discussed. He alluded to several laws of elec
trical intensity attendant on the disposition of electricity on surfaces
and plates varying in extension and in length, but of the same area,
and endeavoured to show that contrary to the ordinary view of
electrical distribution, electricity existed on both surfaces of a hol
low sphere, as well as on both surfaces of a plate of the same area.
He considers every case of attraction in electricity to resolve itself
into the case of charging a coated non-conducting body, and that
the phaenomena always correspond to those observed in the latter.
              On the Aurora Borealis.     By Sir John Ross.
    Having observed in his first arctic expedition that the aurora
sometimes appeared between the two ships, and also between the
ships and the icebergs, and found in his subsequent experience,
both in Scotland and during the second arctic voyage, proofs satis
factory to his own mind that the aurora takes place within the
cloudy regions of the earth's atmosphere, Sir John Ross states
the following hypothesis on the subject, viz. “The aurora is en

On an oeconomic Application of Electro-magnetic Forces to manufac
             turing Purposes.   By Robert MALLET.
    The separation of iron from brass and copper filings, &c., in
workshops, for the purpose of the refusion of them into brass, is
commonly effected by tedious manual labour.                        Several bar or
horse-shoe magnets are fixed in a wooden handle, and are
thrust, in various directions, through a dish or other vessel contain
ing the brass and iron turnings, &c., and when the magnets have be
come loaded with iron it is swept off from them by frequent strokes
of a brush. This is an exceedingly troublesome and inefficacious
process.
    It appeared to the author that a temporary magnet of great power,
formed by the circulation of an electric current round a bar of iron,
might be substituted advantageously. The following is the arrange
ment which he has adopted.              Several large round bars of iron are
bent into the form of the capital letter U, each leg being about six
                   They are                    all              silk-covered wire,
inches long.                         coated with coils                                   of of

                           forming    electro-magnets          such bars, and are
then    arranged     vertically,      the interval   at   five     six inches fromof             or
each other.
    All the wires from these coils are collected into one bundle at
their respective poles, and there joined into one                 soldering,   large         by                         a
wire    being   placed       the midst
                                in           them and     amalgamated.

since the iron bar became by induction a stronger magnet than the
steel, and hence the mutual actions of the iron bar and the magnets
 was more powerful.
   The very limited space within which magnetic action is confined
 presents a very considerable obstacle.     The power is inversely as
the square of the distance; at the eighth of an inch the power even
of a large magnet is comparatively trifling. The stroke of one eighth
of an inch, directly applied to machinery, would be nothing: we must
increase the stroke, and at the same time diminish the power as little
as possible.     Ifwe increase the stroke, by increasing the distance
between the bar and the magnets, we diminish the power inversely
as the square of the distance; if by applying the power of the mag
net at the shorter arm of a lever, we diminish only in the inverse
ratio of the distance: thus, if it is wanted to increase the stroke
twelve times, the power in one case with the smaller distance, is to
the power in the other with the larger distance, as the square of
the larger is to the square of the smaller, as 12°: 1*:: 144: 1.
With a lever, the power with the smaller distance is to the power
with the larger as the distance in the latter case is to the distance
in the former, :: 12:1. The power in any case is much diminished;
but as we can create it in any quantity, this is of little consequence.
The repulsion of the magnet for the bar, though considerable, is
much less than its attraction.
   The construction of the machine by which Mr. M'Gauley has
exemplified the application of magnetism as a moving power is
easily conceived. An oaken frame supports two magnets, A and B,
                horizontally. The bar P K, fixed in a strong pen
       P         dulum of wood, of which S is a horizontal section,

connected with the cups V and R by the wires K and N, and with
the poles of an electro-magnet M by the wires S and T. The wires
K and N rise in the cups of mercury V and R, but do not leave the
mercury.    Let us suppose, as in the figure, the wires n n and n' nº
to dip into the cups c c'': we shall trace the electricity.    It flows
from the copper of the battery F along D to c", along X to c", along
N to R, along T to S, where it enters one pole of the magnet M.
Now, let the wires n n and n' n' have turned a little on their axis
A B, so as to dip respectively into c' and c'". The electricity flows
from F along D to c", along w n, crossing the axis A B, along K,
to V, along S, and enters the magnet at N, before it entered at S;
hence the current is inverted and the poles reversed.

to apply magnetism to machinery, as an advantageous and a powerful
agent, has been totally unsuccessful.     In the experiment brought
under the notice of the Section, the velocity with which the poles of
any number of magnets are reversed is inconceivable, and the whole
lifting power is applied with the greatest possible advantage directly
to the mechanism; circumstances which appear to justify the au
thor's expectation that the application of magnetism to machinery, as
a moving power, will ultimately be successful.

                                LIEUT.-Col. Sykes.
   The thermometric instrument for measuring heights invented by
the late Rev. F. J. H. Wollaston, though very sensible, has been found
by the author and Mr. James Prinsep of Calcutta too fragile and too
expensive for rough nork. After the destruction of three of these in
struments, Col. Sykes had recourse to common thermometers, which,
with certain precautions, he found to answer extremely well, and
having tested their indications by contemporaneous barometrical ob
servations, he was enabled to present a table of comparative results.
The thermometer to be observed was uniformly kept in the water,
which was made to boil violently, about 2 inches above the bottom of
the pot; two thermometers were successively employed, the differ
ence of their scales being known ; different tables of the elastic force
of steam were employed in the reduction; and from the whole of
the results the author has collected a few into a table, calculated
to show the limits of error, of thermometric measures of heights
in India, when the boiling temperature of the level of the sea is
assumed     to be constantly 212°; of single barometrical observa
tions, when the pressure at the level of the sea is assumed to be
30,000 inches, (mean temperature in both cases 82°;) and of corre
sponding barometrical observations.          The general agreement of             all
the  results,   by whatever method     obtained,  isremarkable, and    con is
sidered   by  Col. Sykes      justifying

meters may      be satisfactorily used     supply the place

   Dr. Apjohn explained the substance of two papers recently read
by him before the Royal Irish Academy, and which have within a
few days appeared in the last part of their Transactions.” In the first
of these papers a formula is investigated for pointing out what has
long been considered a desideratum in meteorology, namely, the ex
act relation between the indications of the wet-bulb thermometer
and the corresponding dew-points; while, in the second, a number of
experiments are detailed, instituted for the purpose of testing          ac                                                    its
curacy, and which seemed          prove that the formula represented
                                                          to
observations with      extreme precision. The following

and the specific heat of the medium which encompasses the wet
 thermometer, both of which vary, the former with the temperature,
and the latter with the pressure and the amount of vapour present
in the air. Such objection is theoretically just, and the necessary
 corrections have therefore been investigated by the author in his
 original paper, and may be applied if deemed necessary. Experience
however has satisfied him that, generally speaking, they may be neg
lected, as in almost every instance their amount is considerably
within the inevitable errors of observation.
    The experiments instituted for the purpose of testing the formula,
and which are detailed in the author's second paper, were next ex
plained.    The principle of the first of these is as follows: if air, in
reference to which t, t' and t” (the dew-point) have been accurately
noted, be raised to any elevated temperature, and the observation be
repeated in the heated air as far as respects t and            we shall have                  t',

     The discovery of a spring near Torre del Annunziata having oc
 casioned the removal of a considerable portion of a cliff, a clear sec

 the base of Vesuvius. The entire height of the cliff is 68 feet, and it
 presents the following details:
     Vegetable mould, mixed with decomposed lava, 5 to 10 feet.
     Hard, compact, cellular lava, with occasionally considerable cavi
 ties, and scoriform at the bottom, 5 feet.
     In one of the cavities of this stratum, Dr. Daubeny states, on the
 authority of Colonel Robinson, that a considerable quantity of car
 bonate of magnesia was found; and Dr. Daubeny also found in the
 same lava a white coating, which appeared to contain a very large
 proportion of         The author further states that Colonel Robinson has

large square building represented in that ancient map, opposite to the
word Oplonti, indicates in other places a thermal spring, which the
recent excavations made in this spot prove to have existed there in
the time of the Romans.        The catastrophe which overwhelmed the
cypress and fir, above alluded to, Dr. Daubeny conceives happened
prior to 572, because near Bosce-tre-case, about two miles to the
north of Torre del Annunziata, and on the slope of Vesuvius, was
lately discovered, a few feet below the surface, a bag of Roman gold
coins, evidently almost fresh from the mint, and bearing that date;
while he conceives that it may have been effected by the great erup
tion of 472. Considering, however, that the buildings underneath
must have been overwhelmed by some eruption antecedent to that
which covered the trees (these latter appearing to have grown in
the very materials which enveloped the former), he is disposed to
assign the formation of the beds constituting the lower part of the
cliff to the eruption of 79; but he adds, it is remarkable that an event
which covered the neighbourhood of Torre del Annunziata to the
depth of more than 30 feet, should not have added sensibly to the
accumulation of volcanic materials over Pompeii.
    The spring of Torre del Annunziata possesses a temperature of
about 87° of Fahrenheit, and, according to the analysis of Professor
 Ricci of Naples, abounds chiefly in the bicarbonates of soda, mag
 nesia, potass, and lime, with sulphate and muriate of potass, muriate
of soda, and muriate of magnesia. The quantity of carbonic acid gas
 discharged is so great as to maintain the water constantly in a
 violent ebullition, and to render the air in the stone cylinder through
 which it escapes unrespirable.      The same gas also rises in bubbles
 through the sea, near the spot; and there are patches of land upon
 the cliff, upon which, owing to the disengagement of this gas, no
 plant can be made to grow.        Dr. Daubeny then points out the pre
 sence of oxygen and nitrogen gas, not only in the spring of Torre
 del Annunziata, but in those of St. Lucia in Naples, at the Lago di
 Amsanti, the Agua Santa on Mount Vultur, and the Lago di Solfa
 tara near Tivoli; the proportion of oxygen varying from 9 to 16 per
 cent., and of nitrogen from 84 to 91. With reference to the origin
 of the nitrogen gas of these and other springs, Dr. Daubeny states
 that he is ready to admit the possibility that it may, in many instances,
 be separated from the water, and not be derived from an independent
 source.
    To those, however, who refuse to admit volcanic action to be a pro
 cess of oxygenation, he says, such a mode of explaining the emission
 of nitrogen would seem to remove the difficulty only one step further,
 since it still remains to be shown why spring water, which is in ge
 neral impregnated more fully with oxygen than nitrogen gas, should,
 in these cases, disengage chiefly the latter.      He also adds, that in
 none of the warm    springs  in the neighbourhood   of Naples does nitro
 gen appear to be evolved in any notable quantity; and that the warm
 springs of Ischia are destitute of   all  gaseous impregnation :   and in
 conclusion, whilst admitting that the hot springs     of   Campania fur
  nishno   positive confirmationof   the connexion between volcanic pro

   cesses and the evolution of nitrogen, the author contends, on the other
   hand, that they suggest no facts which can set aside the evidence in
  favour of that position, which the production of ammonia within the
  volcano itself appears to furnish.
      A letter was afterwards read, from Lieut. Freyer, R.N., addressed
  to Charles Lyell, Esq., P.G.S., on the appearance of elevation of land
  on the west coast of South America.
     The localities alluded to in this letter are Arica, lat. 18° 26' south,
  the Island of San Lorenzo in the Bay of Callao, and Valparaiso.
      Mr. Freyer states, that on his first arrival at Arica he was struck by
  finding shells, in very great abundance, at considerable heights above
  the present level of the sea. To the north of the town the coast is
  low, with a shingly beach and sandy plains, no rock being exposed;
  but he here found shells of existing species ten or twelve feet above
 high-water mark. On the south are interesting sections, consisting
  of innumerable thin beds of red sandstone and gypsum, resting upon
  shale, in which fragments of fossil shells were noticed. The bold pro
  montory called the Morro of Arica is formed by the dislocation and
  elevation of this sandstone to the height of about 400 feet, by a mass
 of basalt, porphyry, and pitchstone, which pass insensibly into each
  other. Near the summit of the Morro the sandstone contains layers
 of a salt, consisting of chlorine 31-6, sodium 31-6, sulphuric acid 14-0,
 lime 9:45, potash and magnesia 9-0, insoluble (silex) 4-0*. South
 of the Morro the sandstone and gypsum beds have a small southerly
 dip, and form indistinct terraces towards the shore. On these ter
 races, wherever the rock is exposed, Balani and encrusting Millepora
 are found. At the height of about twenty or thirty feet above the sea
 they are as abundant, and almost as perfect, as on the shore; at up
 wards of fifty feet they still occur, but abraded by the sand con
 stantly blowing over them; and there are traces of them at still
 greater heights. In the island of San Lorenzo in the Bay of Callao,
 Mr. Freyer found, at considerable heights, Concholepas, Pecten pur
 pureus, Sigaretus concavus, with other shells, in great abundance,
 and retaining their colour almost as freshly as those living in the ad
jacent sea. Mr. Freyer states that he did not visit Conception, but
 that he had seen cargoes of the lime made from the shells found at
                     to its
 great heights in       neighbourhood.
     With respect      Valparaiso      regrets

miles north-east from Edinburgh. The promontories which form the
two extremities of the bay of Elie, consist of amygdaloid and basalt,
the latter exhibiting sometimes a columnar structure. Between these
headlands the beach is low, and composed of alternating, thin beds of
sandstone and shale, with occasionally seams of coal and strata of
limestone, the whole belonging to a carboniferous system, and                                        in
clined at high angles in different directions, and without any regu
larity. Basalt occurs in numerous places, extending in long reefs
far into the sea; the beds of sandstone and shale dipping from them
on both sides; but at one point in the western part of the bay the
strata are said to dip under the basalt.
    About two miles to the eastward of Elie is a small promontory,
near the extremity of which is situated the bed of marine shells. The
extent of the deposit across the promontory does not exceed eighty
yards; but       its
                  range inland could not                     be
                                              ascertained. The bed rests
unconformably upon strata          sandstone and shale containing masses
                                            of

imbedded       clay, but are more frequently scattered irregularly through
the deposit, and belong, without exception,          existing species. The

better preserved; the greatest height         which they were noticed,

    This bed is separated by a well-defined line from another of red
gravel, about six feet thick, resting upon London clay.        It is com
 posed of rounded chalk flints and sand, and saurian vertebrae are
occasionally found in it; but no remains of Mammalia have been no
ticed either in it or the superior bed.    Mr. Spencer states that there
 appears to be, in the whole of the deposit, a total absence of the
 small rounded pebbles of Lickey quartz, which are plentiful on the
 summits of the neighbouring hills of Highgate and Hampstead: and
 in conclusion he suggests that the current of water which brought the
 materials of the upper bed into their present situation flowed from
 the north.                                                             *
    March   25-A    paper was read, entitled “Remarks on the Struc
ture of large Mineral Masses, and especially on the Chemical Changes
produced in the Aggregation of Stratified Rocks during different pe
riods after their deposition;" by the Rev. Adam Sedgwick, F.G.S.,
Woodwardian Professor in the University of Cambridge.
                            § 1. Introduction.
   The first section of the paper is devoted to some general considera
*
tions of the changes produced both by igneous and aqueous agents.
 Changes of the former class may be effected in a comparatively short
period, and can sometimes be imitated in a laboratory. But changes
of the latter class have often been effected during indefinite periods of
time, and under circumstances which admit not of imitation. In such
cases it is by observation only, and not by direct experiment, that we
can hope to rise to a rational explanation of the phaenomena.        The
              gives some examples of both kinds of change here con
sidered.
                 § 2. Globular Concretionary Structure.
   The author remarks, that although this kind of structure, as seen
in aqueous rocks, can seldom be imitated, yet it may be explained, in
most cases, compatibly with the known modes of material action, and
the phaenomena may be correctly classified.        He then proceeds to
give examples of the structure in question.                             -
    1. Chalk  Flints.—They   are posterior  to the existence of the beds
in which they are found. The free siliceous matter of the formation
has not been uniformly diffused, but accumulated in distinct concre
tions; and therefore illustrates the principle contended for in the
paper.
   2. Globular Calciferous Grit, &c.—The author dwells at consider
able length on the internal structure of calciferous grits, and explains
their chatoyant lustre by the independent crystallization of carbonate
of lime through definite spaces. He then points out several cases of
such rocks with a regular spheroidal structure, and with the lamina
tions of original deposit passing, without interruption, through the
several spheroids; and he infers from such phaenomena that the glo
bular structure was superinduced during the passage of the stratified
mass into a solid state.
   3. Globular Magnesian Limestone.—For a detailed account of this
structure, he refers to a former memoir in the Society's Transactions,

and endeavours to confirm, by new arguments, the conclusion he
drew from the phaenomena, viz., that     the complicated concretions all
in the formation   the magnesian limestone, have been produced since

slate quarries there is no indication whatsoever of the true bedding;
but whenever the slates have a striped structure, the stripes (so well
known in the Cumberland and Welsh roofing-slates) are parallel to
the true beds.    To this rule there is no erception in the regions de
scribed; and in thousands of instances the stripes are seen to be
parallel to the alternating masses of “coarse greywacké', and to cal
careous beds with organic remains.
   The author then describes a flaggy, passing into a finely laminated,
structure, parallel to the bedding.         He points out the manner of di
stinguishing this from a true slaty structure, which may readily be
done in a quarry, and, generally, even in examining hand specimens.
    In this view, a laminated structure and a slaty structure differ so
entirely in their origin, that however nearly they may resemble each
other in some instances, they ought never to be confounded under
the same name.
    Finally, he distinguishes cleavage planes from the contorted laminae
of argillaceous schists; and endeavours to prove, by a long series of
sections derived from various parts of North and South Wales, that
the introduction of a crystalline cleavage was the last chemical change
superinduced on the slaty deposits before they became entirely solid.
    He then speculates on the enormous amount of force necessary to
produce a crystalline cleavage through whole mountain chains of me
chanical rocks; and supposes it due to an accumulated intensity of
crystalline action in a nearly homogeneous mass, every part of which
is exposed to the same conditions of aggregation while passing into
its  ultimate solid form. He illustrates this principle                       by
                                                                    contrasting

     In   all

granite are considered as examples of this structure. A jointed struc
ture of this kind may in some instances be derived from an original
globular structure; but the prismatic and cuboidal blocks of granite
are not considered as due to such a cause, and the concentric crusts
into which such blocks are found to decompose, are regarded as the
natural effects of decomposition on a mass of homogeneous structure.
This conclusion is supported by the fact, that artificial pillars of gra
nite (or even of oolitic limestone) sometimes decompose in concentric
cylindrical crusts.

mentioned some years ago by Mr. Webster*.        Since that time Dr.
Buckland and Mr. De la Beche have inferred that both these trunks
and the Cycadeae described by the formert as occurring in the same
stratum, must actually have grown in the places where their remains
are found f ; and, more recently, Professor Henslow has ascertained
the existence of two other beds of clay, between that which includes
the trees and Cycadeae and the Portland stone. The author of the
present notice was so fortunate as to visit the island, during the last
summer, at a moment when the remains of Cycadeae were found in
 one of these lower beds, and to see some of them before they were
 disturbed. The bed in which they occur is between those which are
 called by the quarry-men “Cap” and “Skull-cap", both of which
 consist of freshwater limestone; the latter being separated from the
 Portland stone by no more than two or three inches of clay. The
 Cycadeae in this lower bed were in some cases of very large horizontal
 dimensions, and, like those in the dirt above the “Cap", were in
 the upright position, and apparently in the places where they ori
 ginally grew.
    The author found thin beds of clay, with more or less admixture
 of mechanically divided matter, alternating in several other instances
 with the fissile limestone at the lower part of the Purbeck forma
 tion. Even the “Cap", which in Portland is generally a continuous
mass of limestone six to eight feet thick, without stratification, in
cludes, in other places at              its
                                   lower part, alternations         thin strata   of                            of

limestones of Bermuda, and of the shores of Australia, and other
places in low latitudes; a fact which accords with the supposition that
this portion of England was for some time in the condition of a bank,
very near the surface,—or of an island of small height above the sea.
   The inferences from the new facts mentioned in this paper, the
author remarks, do not invalidate the conclusions of previous ob
servers; showing only that land must have existed and produced
vegetation, above the present site of Portland Island, before the de
position of the upper of the two beds, which contains the trees and
Cycadeae. The whole of the freshwater strata seems to have been the
deposit of a lake, or an estuary, of freshwater, in which (whatever
was the cause of the alternations), the waters must have deserted the
strata previously accumulated at their bottom, at two successive
periods at least; in each case during a space of time sufficient for
the growth of Cycadeae; and in the latter of the two cases, of trees
also, upon the surface of the land thus exposed.
   In conclusion, the author suggests, that the Isle of Portland should .
be visited from time to time, and frequently, by geologists; since
                                                                                                                by

isting marine species.         The pebbles had undergone considerable
attrition, but presented a flattened, not a spheroidal form. They con
sisted chiefly of granite, slate, chert, porphyries, greenstone, amyg
daloid, new red sandstone, coal-measure sandstone, and quartz peb
bles, identical with those of the conglomerate beds of the new red
sandstone of the district. The shells, which were thickly disseminated
through the whole deposit, were in an extremely friable condition,
and belonged to Turritella terebra, Cardium edule, and Murer erina
ceus, as well as to a thin smooth bivalve, the genus of which could
 not be determined. The extent or thickness of the deposit the author
 was not able to ascertain, though he was informed that in making a
 well at “The Willington", twelve yards of gravel and sand were pene
 trated before the new red sandstone was reached; he could not, how
 ever, learn if any Testacea had been noticed in making the well.
     The shelly bed was separated by a well-defined line from an over
 lying deposit, twenty feet thick, of the ordinary diluvium of Cheshire,
 and consisted principally of sand, containing pebbles and boulders of
 granite, slate, greenstone, and other rocks.                                 -
     From “The Willington” the country slopes very gradually to the
 Gowey, a small sluggish stream which conveys the drainage of this
 part of Cheshire to the river Mersey, and empties itself into that
 river near the village of Ince. The author then quotes some extracts
 from the Red Book of St. Warburgh's Abbey, given in “Ormerod's
 Topographical Account of Cheshire,” stating that in Wyrall, in the
 manor of Ynes, the sea had removed thirty caracates of land, and
 was daily destroying more : the author also states that, according to
 popular tradition, the sea once occupied a large portion of the valley
 at the foot of the Forest Hills.
     From the above details, and from a careful examination of all the
 facts he could collect, he gives the following, as the conclusions at
  which he has arrived :
      1st. That the bed of gravel was deposited on the shore of the an
  cient sea, at that period extending to the base of the Forest Hills.
     2nd. That this has occurred since the existence of some of the spe
  cies of shells now inhabiting our seas.
     3rd. That an alteration in the relative levels of land and sea, to
  the amount of seventy feet, has taken place since        its
                                                             deposition.
     4th. That  it    has been covered
                                          by   an accumulation        of
                                                                      diluvium

pores in the ambulacra, have been found to be inconstant; the num
ber of these increasing, as they are now known to do, with the age
of the specimens. He proposed to divide the Echini as follows:
                                Genus 1. ARBAcIA.
  Corpus depressum.
  Area ambulacrorum angustissimae:       ambulacra angusta, recta, sin
      gulo e serie simplici tesserarum biporosarum superpositarum
      efformato.
   Tesserae ovariales et interovariales mediocres.
   Anus valvis quatuor spiniferis tectus.
   This genus corresponds with Echinus section A. of M. de Blain
ville, and contains Arbacia pustulosa (Echinus pustulosus, Lam.),
Arb. punctulata (Ech. punctulatus, Lam.), &c.
                                Genus 2. SALENIA.
    Corpus subsphaericum.
    Areae ambulacrorum angustissimae: ambulacra angusta, recta, sin
       gulo e serie simplici tesserarum biporosarum superpositarum
       efformato.
    Tesserae ovariales et interovariales maximae.
                                                                        -
    Anus subexcentricus.
    This genus is known only in the fossil state, and has hitherto even
 been confounded with Cidaris, but its tubercles are not pierced.     It
 comprehends Salenia scutiger (Cidaris scutiger, Munst., Goldf. Pe
 tref., t. 49. f. 4.—Park., Org. Rem., t. 12. f. 13.; Echinus petali
ferus, Desm.) and two or three other allied species in Mr. Gray's
 collection.

    Corpus plus minusve depressum.
    Areae ambulacrorum  latitudine dimidium              arearum extraambula

    Tesserae ovariales et interovariales mediocres.
   Anus subcentralis, squamosus; squamis spiniferis.
   The ambulacral tesserae in this genus may be regarded as being
each composed of three doubly pierced pieces: of these the upper
is placed in the middle of the upper edge of the tessera; the next
below     it,   on
              the middle     the outer edge; and the lowest
                                 of                                 the     on

                                                 that when the plates
are together, forming the ambulacra, the pores appear     form oblique
                                                                  to

         of                      the plate above the other two double

    This genus contains the sections B+.      and
                                                 C.

 ville. The species may      divided into two very distinct sections,
                                  be
 thus:
    1. Ambulacris angustioribus poris mediocribus approximatis.

    Of this section Ech. esculentus may be regarded as the type.
    On this species Mr. Gray incidentally remarked that it is extremely
variable in shape, becoming very high and subconical in the adult age,
when it is Ech. Melo, Lam.; and being often subangular, in which
condition it is Ech. subangulosus, Ejusd.
        b. Ore profunde inciso.
    Ech. ercavatus, Lam.; Ech. Pileolus, Lam. ; &c.
    2. Ambulacris latis : poris inter se tuberculis parvis sejunctis :
       ore 5-inciso.
    Ech. ventricosus, Lam. ; &c.
                         Genus 4. EchinoMETRA.
    Corpus plus minusve depressum,      saepe  oblongum.
    Area ambulacrorum mediocres:        tesserae ambulacrales quinquariam
       vel ultra biporosae.
    Tesserae ovariales et interovariales mediocres.
    Anus subcentralis, squamosus; squamis saepe spiniferis.
    In this genus the ambulacral plates may be considered as being
 composed of five or more doubly pierced pieces, which form an
 arched line round the outer edge of the tessera, with a single pair
 of pores at its lower inner angle.
    The spines with which the species of this genus are furnished are
 often of very unequal size, and they are of very variable form, some
 of the larger ones being very long, as in Echinometra trigonaria;
 and others very short and truncated, as in Ech. atrata.
     Mr. Gray stated that he had formerly separated from the Echini
 some of the species of this genus which are peculiar for their oblong
 form, and that the genus so proposed by him had been adopted by
 M. de Blainville; but a much more extended examination has con
 vinced him that individuals of the same species vary from roundish to
 oblong : and, therefore, having observed many round species agree
 ing with oblong ones in the peculiar character of the ambulacra, he
 has united them to the former, under the same name.             It is to be
 remarked, as throwing doubt on the bilaterality of the Echinidae,
 attempted to be established by M. Agassiz”, that the spongy ovarial
 plate which that gentleman regarded as the mark of the hinder part
 of the Echinidae, is always placed on one side or the other of the
 longer axis of the oblong species.
     This genus will contain sections B+". D. and F. of M. de Blain
  ville, as well as the Echinometra of that author, and many new spe
  cies which are as yet undescribed.
     Mr. Gray subsequently exhibited a specimen of a new genus of
  Corals, which he had recently received from the coast of Montserrat
  in the West Indies. The coral in question is formed almost entirely
  of rather large transparent rough fusiform spicula, which are irre
  gularly placed side by side along the stems, and are imbedded in the
  animal matter: the spicula are so abundant as to render the coral

gonite, of which it has also the form.    Its stem is irregularly cylin
drical, rather crooked, and slightly tapering : it throws off a rather
thinner branch a little below the middle of the main stem; and both
the main stem and              its
                       branch end        hemispherical head, the upper
                                                            in  a

tubercles, each terminating       small central mouth. These tuber
                                               in     a
cles are formed     spicula resembling those
                         of                         the stem, the points        of
of  which arm the apices                     of
                                   the cones. The central cones are the
largest and most distinct, and the marginal ones are smaller, and
more     or less confluent. The stem when broken exhibits similar spi
cula and few internal cells, but
              a                             has no distinct central aris: the

                              of
and give exit through their central mouths           the Polypes which formto
the coral.
    This coral appears                   be
                                  most nearly allied
                                    to                   the genus Zenia (of     to
which Alcyonium floridum            Esper      the type), and agrees with

with large spicula, and the Polypes protruded from tubular cells

its  spicula   being   much more     abundant,   and the coral consequently
more    solid,  and  by     means  no
                                    spongy;     and     being less branched,in
with the      polype-cells  forming       hemispherical a head, instead                                       of   a

other portions of phosphoric acid, procured from other druggists at
Berlin, gave the same results. M. Barwald satisfied himself that
neither the vessel used, the nitric acid nor the sulphuretted hydrogen
contained any arsenic, and that this metal came from the phospho
rus. He learnt from another druggist that water in which phosphorus
was long kept also contained arsenic. This fact was confirmed by
Wittstock; but phosphorus which he himself prepared did not con
tain any arsenic.       His experiments also showed that a considerable
quantity of arsenic might be mixed with phosphorus without materially
altering         its
              appearance; but, according             the proportion        the ar

         MY       DEAR    SIR,
I    AM fully aware that the pages of your Journal are far too valu
able to be occupied by silly and consequently useless controversy;
still I hope you will be able to favour me with a space, in your next
number, for the following brief remarks.
   In the last number of your Journal, page 231, I observe in the first
paragraph of a long letter from Mr. William Sturgeon, that he has
been pleased to indulge himself in using rather strong language
against some one. I have accordingly inquired of this gentleman
whether in that paragraph he alluded to me, and he has very politely
answered me “Yes”.
   It therefore only remains for me in reply to his attack simply to
repeat, what          I
                  have before stated, in a letter in your Journal, page
238, March number, that the phaenomena which Mr. Sturgeon re
corded as new in November 1834, were known and exhibited to some
of the first philosophers of this country many months previously; and
if Mr. Sturgeon doubt my assertion, I refer him without hesitation to
any of the gentlemen mentioned in my letter above alluded                                    to.

                   MY     DEAR      PHILLIPs,
    . .           OU know     as well as most persons how great my dislike
                  is to controversy,    but you also know that upon some rare
            occasions I have been driven into it; an occasion of this kind
            constrains me at present to ask a favour of you. On the 22nd
            of January of this year, two papers were read at the Royal
                                                                                           º

338         Mr. Faraday's Reply              to   Dr. John Davy's Remarks.
fessor Jameson, the learned Editor of the Edinburgh Journal,
may be to act impartially, and give me the same opportunity of
publication he has given Dr. Davy, he cannot do so before the
lapse of three months.         Under these circumstances, and with
the old adage before my eyes that “delays are dangerous,” may
I beg you to insert this letter and my paper in the next Num
 ber of the Philosophical Magazine 2 and I may still, perhaps,
be indebted to the kindness of Professor Jameson for its in
sertion in the next number of the Journal in which Dr. Davy's
 “Remarks” have appeared.

   Royal Institution, Oct. 10, 1835.                M. FARADAY.

having read             it,

                          I              hope the present note may

     Again, Dr. Davy says, “What can be more clear than this;
  that my brother did not consider water as essential to the
 formation of a voltaic combination?” &c.              If this be so clear,
 how    happens    it that Mr.     Brande,    in the last edition of his
 Manual, vol. i. p. 97, says that “Sir Humphry Davy further
 remarks that there are no fluids, ercept such as contain water,
  which are capable of being made the medium of connexion
  between the metals of the voltaic apparatus;” and Mr. Brande's
  observation        “This, however, appears

I   ought, perhaps, rather        ask, How could Sir Humphry Davy
                                              to
 use such words, and mean what Dr. Davy wishes                         consi               to        be
 dered    as his meaning?       Why,     there can            doubt that  be     no                            if
I    had proved that water was the only substance that could per
 form these duties, Dr. Davy would have claimed the discovery
 for his brother.
     As cannot impute
        I                         Dr. Davy the intention

 port the views advanced twenty-eight years ago, and for the
 first time, by our great philosopher.
     Ihave such extreme dislike to controversy that          shall not                 I
 prolong these remarks, and regret much that I have been
 obliged to make them.       I am not conscious of having been
 unjust to Sir Humphry Davy, to whom I am anxious to give
all due honour; but, on the other hand,              feel anxious lest I
Dr.   Davy   should  inadvertently  be  doing   injury to his brother
by attaching a meaning, sometimes of particularity and some
times of extension, to his words which             am sure he wouldI
never himself have     claimed, but which,   on the contrary, I feel
he has disavowed in saying “that our philosophical systems
are very imperfect,” and in expressing his confidence “that
they must change more or less with the advancement of science.”
On these points, however, neither Dr. Davy nor myself can
now assume to be judges, since with respect to them he has
made us both partisans.       Dr. Davy has not made me aware
of  anything   that I need    change;   and I am quite willing to
leave the matter as it stands in the printed papers before sci
entific men, with only this request, which I am sure before
hand will be granted, that such parts of Sir Humphry Davy's
papers and my own as relate to the subject in question, be
considered both as to their letter and spirit before any con
clusion be drawn.

or more of these molecules unite to form more compound
Ones.
   Mechanical forces can only separate the particles: the force
resulting from the vibration of the atoms can separate the
more compound molecule of a solid substance into more sim
ple ones, such as those which exist in a liquid or in a gas.
Chemical forces alone can separate ulteriorly these last mole
cules. For example, in the detonation of the mixture of one
volume of oxygen with two of hydrogen, from which result
two volumes of aqueous vapour, reduced to the original tem
perature, every molecule of oxygen is divided into two, and
the atoms of each of these halves unite to the atoms of a mo
lecule of hydrogen to form a molecule of water.
   This division of molecules by chemical forces results from
a principle which I established in a memoir printed in 1814,
in the Annales des Mines, namely, that in equal volumes of
any gas or vapour whatever, under the same pressure and at
the same temperature,                 are contained the          same        number     of
molecules.
   With regard to atoms, the only property which think can                   I
with certainty be attributed to them is that of being abso
lutely indivisible, so that although space be infinitely divisible,
matter cannot be so, for when the division is conceived to
have arrived at the atoms, every further division would of
necessity take place in the intervening empty spaces”. Enter
taining such views of this subject, I distinguish molecu
lar from atomic vibrations.          In the first the molecules                        vi
brate   collectively   in  approaching    to and receding from one
another alternately; and whether they so vibrate or are at
rest, the atoms of every molecule can, and, in fact, always do,
vibrate in alternately approaching and receding from one
another, without ceasing to belong to the same molecule.
These last I call atomic vibrations.
   It is to molecular vibrations, and their propagation through
ambient mediums, that I attribute                        all
                                                  the phaenomena                        of

Vibratory motion not being possible except around                 state          a

tive force when the distance varies. Finally, these two forces
may be considered as one, the mathematical expression of
which should contain two terms with contrary signs, each cor
responding to one of the forces in question.
    Now, it is clear that if we admit the phaenomena of heat to
be produced by vibrations, it is a contradition to attribute to
heat the repulsive force of the atoms requisite to enable them
to vibrate.
   In order to form a clear idea of the manner in which heat
is propagated according to the several laws, 1st, when it moves
within the substance of a body, and 2ndly, when it exists
in the state of radiant heat, it is necessary to observe at start
ing that in the latter case it cannot be distinguished from
light, for light is nothing else than radiant heat having be
come capable of passing through the humours of the eye, be
cause the frequency and intensity of the vibrations which con:
stitute it are then sufficiently powerful to be transmitted
through these humours". It will next be necessary to com
pare these two sorts of propagations to the two modes in which
sound is propagated.       As a preliminary we will describe these
two modes of propagation.
    Suppose a diapason set in vibration, and endeavour to de
fine, first, what we ought to understand by the vis viva of                                                              its

posed for the transmission of heat, —it is evident that we shall
find for the transmission of this force in the systems of diapa
sons the same equations at which those philosophers have ar
rived for temperature agreeably to their respective hypotheses.
    Let us observe here, that so long as we consider the dia
pasons as having sensibly but one single dimension, we are
obliged to subject them to the condition of being capable of
vibrating in unison; but as M. Savart has demonstrated that
vibrating forces of two dimensions, and with greater reason
vibrating bodies of three dimensions, are susceptible, by gra
dual changes in the nodal lines, to take the unison of any                                                 vi
brating body whatever, it suffices here to substitute, in every
thing that precedes, the name of diapason for that of a vibra
ting plate or solid, in order to find true everything we have
been saying, without any condition relative to the form or                                                 di
 mension of the bodies.
    Let us now apply this to the molecules of a heated body,
considering these molecules as so many diminutive solids
susceptible of vibrating independently of one another, and of
                                                                        in vis

bouring molecule, of the attractive and repulsive forces of the
atoms of which the two molecules are composed, is susceptible
of experiencing any changes which tend to make the atoms of
the second             vibrate.  But this manner of considering
the subject requiring calculations which I have not made, I
have not thought proper to insist on the development of the
consequences of this idea.      My object in these considerations
is  only  to demonstrate how the vibrations by which heat is
propagated in bodies may follow a law entirely different from
that of the vibrations of sound, of light and of radiant heat,
these latter vibrations being propagated by undulations which
leave at rest the part of the vibrating body where they have
passed, without a trace remaining of the passage, while the
former are made gradually, and from one object to the nearest,
and in such a manner that the vibrations of those parts which
are nearer to the source of heat remain always superior in
 intensity to the vibrations more distant, by a quantity which
 truly diminishes continually and by degrees, but that, mathe
 matically speaking, would only become nothing after an infi
 mite lapse of time.

reach the pile by conduction in one case than in the other, with
out any reference to polarization.
  The question is not, however, as has been stated, “purely
mathematical.”      It must be shown that the alleged effect is
not merely of the kind required, but that        amount     such     its               is             as
to produce the observed variation; and since the temperature

XL.     Some Remarks upon the     Crag Formation of Norfolk and
                Suffolk.   By SAMUEL Woodward, Esq.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
            me, through the medium of your Journal, to
PERMIT
  offer a few remarks on a paper by Mr. Charlesworth in
serted in your Number for August, p. 81.
   Feeling a kindred spirit with Mr. Charlesworth in bringing
these interesting deposits into notice, and moreover a desire
that truth should prevail, I do, in the true spirit of scientific
inquiry, state that my views of the subject do not square with
                                                          -
those of that gentleman.
   In the first place, his red crag is decidedly diluvium or dis
rupted crag, with an admixture of the oxide of iron, pre
cisely similar to what we witness in the gravel of Norfolk.
We have also in this county immense beds of transported
crag shells, in the cliffs south and north of Yarmouth, and
at Cromer, but with this difference,—they are imbedded in
sand”.
   Secondly, his term ‘coralline crag’ is not appropriate, as it
leads us to suppose that it is composed of corallines, when, in
fact, there are none in the Ramsholt bed, which is chiefly
adverted tof. Mr. Charlesworth has not mentioned the great
coral-reef situate about three quarters of a mile north of Ald
borough, which contains (as far as I have observed) neither
univalves nor bivalves, except a few Pectens. I think he must
have had this locality in his mind's eye, and thus been led to
the misnomert.
   At the close of the prefatory remarks to my Outline of the
Geology of Norfolk, I stated, on the authority of a friend, that
there was a bed of shells at Ramsholt analogous to those of
the calcaire grossier of Paris.    I subsequently visited this                        lo
cality, and found that the bed in question was what might be
termed undisturbed crag, and the superincumbent bed was
  [• Mr.Woodward appears to us to have overlooked the great difference
between the organic remains of the red and coralline crag, as shown by
Mr. Charlesworth.-EDIT.]
 [+ We apprehend that this designation as applied to the lower crag by
Mr. Charlesworth, refers merely to    its
                                   being characterized          by
                                                            abundancean
of corals, having     no
                      reference  tothe bodies termed corallines.        exactly

analogous  to  the appellation  “coralline oolite” already  established    geo   in
logy.—Edit.]

356    On certain Points in Meteorology and Magnetism.
I consider   worth communicating to you.        As long as I can re
member, the equinoctial gales came from the westward, until
the westward variation of the magnet ceased to proceed, and
it began to retrograde towards the north, when the gales have
come from the eastward.       Easterly gales have this year pre
ceded the equinoxes, and at this moment it is blowing hard
from the east at the place whence I write. This leads me to
think that it would be of importance for those who have the
charge of meteorological registers, to examine them in refer
ence to changes in magnetic variation during past times, as
far back as registers go; and to note whether any remarkable
changes in climate have taken place; and more particularly
to ascertain whether the fact respecting the change in the           di
rection of the equinoctial gales has been universal in Great
 Britain, or confined to the northern parts of the island. Should
it be found that there is a connexion between atmospheric
phaenomena and terrestrial magnetism, and that the move
 ments of the magnetic meridian are accompanied by change
in the direction of periodic winds, we may come at length to
 ascertain some laws by which nature is governed hitherto
 unknown to us.
   I  have also observed that the east wind, which has hereto
 fore been remarked as the driest, has of late come to us much
 charged with moisture.
   I  beg leave to take this opportunity of remarking, that I con
 ceive no dependence can be placed on the thermometric ob
 servations made in the garden of the Horticultural Society.
 It is some time since I pointed out to Professor Lindley the
 defects of the apparatus.      Instead of the thermometer bein
 placed in the shade of a wall, it is exposed near the
                                                                §.
                                                                Sun,
                                                                    .#
 under a wooden roof which absorbs the direct rays of
 and radiates heat to the instruments. Thus the indications
 are too high.
    As it is of importance that the instruments used in meteoro
 logical observatories should  all agree exactly; and     as
                                                           it known
                                                               is
 that even those constructed     by  the same maker do not always
 agree with one another,    all  the instruments    inEurope should
 be   compared.     Indeed, one maker should         beappointed      to
  construct  every  instrument used   in   observatories,    that all
                                                               so
  may  be made   to  agree witha   standard.

XLII.             On Divergence as the Cause                                   of Motion in Plants.                          By

  N   a former communication I have given a description of
    the phaenomena of divergence, and I have endeavoured to
prove the analogy of this property to the irritability of the
animal system +.                        I
                        shall now attempt to show that the cause
of divergence is the cause of the motion in plants.
    Ido not think it necessary to enumerate the many instances
and varieties of vital or other motion which are met with in
works on vegetable physiology.          Instead of extending my re
marks to vegetable motion in general,            shall at present con                I
fine my observations to one kind, which, from              frequent oc                            its

opinion, a most curious and unexpected illustration        of the
theory which     I
                 have been attempting to prove.
    Let us now review the                 Fig. 4.
facts and experiments which
have been adduced, and see
what may be reasonably
made out from them.
   It has been proved by           di
viding the stem of a plant
which has already under
gone     curvature    upwards,
(Exp. 1. and 2.) that both
the segments are endowed
with the property of diver
gence.
   It is evident also from the
same experiments, that the
lower segment cannot con
tribute to this motion, as any
effect which it may have
must be greatest in an op
posite direction.
   The motion or curvature
upwards must therefore de
pend on the other, the upper
segment; and when we see
the great, the excessive force
with which the upper seg
ment retracts on being
freed from the anta
gonism of the lower
segment, we can hardly
fail to believe, that in
this retraction (or rather
in  its  cause) we have
discovered    anadequate,
and I    think the true
source of the motion.
    Hence, come
           I           to
                       the
conclusion, that the kind
of motion here treated
of is  the result of the
 contractile force or        di
vergence    of the upper
segment prevailing over

 362         On Divergence as the Cause                 of Motion in Plants.
      It will, no doubt, immediately occur to the reader, that to
  substantiate the above inference it is incumbent on me to
  show, that removal or destruction of the upper segment is
  followed by loss or diminution of the power of curving up
  wards.      Now although, on account of the facility with which
  new matter (probably endowed with moving fibres) is added
  to mutilated plants, it be very difficult entirely to prevent
  stems curving upwards by removal of the upper segment, yet
 I  have occasionally seen the experiment succeed, and I can
  confidently affirm, that the process, if not prevented, is much
  retarded, and of this fact the experiments above described
  are a sufficient proof.       In Exp. 3. the part of the stem of
  Spearmint from which the upper segment had been removed
  had not curved upwards at the end of three days, and in
  Exp. 4. this action did not begin until five days after. In
  the natural state this would certainly have occurred in about
  twenty-four hours.
     We conclude, then, that as in the first series of experiments
  the cause of motion was traced into the upper segment of a
 divided stem, so we here find that removal of this part prevents
 or retards the same motion.
     The experiments on the effects of notching curiously con
 firm and illustrate the inferences drawn from the preceding
 experiments.
     By the process of notching, we artificially weaken the
 contractility of one side, and enable that of the other to exert
 itself so as to arch the stem. In this way curvature or mo–
 tion in almost any direction may be produced at will, as in
 Exp. 5. Exp. 6. shows the effect of notching in delaying the
 motion upwards; one stem notched on the upper side was still
 horizontal on the second day after the operation.
     In Exp. 7. the process of notching has so completely de
 stroyed the action of the upper portion of the stem, that at
 the end of twelve days the stem was still inclined downwards,
 and even the apex was not turned upwards.
     If  anything more be necessary to establish the fact that
divergence is the cause of the motion in plants here treated
 of,   it   is   to
                show that the want                     of
                                            this property        attendedis

 XLIII.        On certain coloured Bands observed in examining                            New
                          ton's Rings. By A. R.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
 INvexexamining  Newton's rings I was induced to place a con
         lens (36-inch focus) between two surfaces of plate
  glass, in order to effect the superposition of the rings.
     My attention was suddenly diverted when viewing the rings
  with transmitted light, by observing a series of coloured
  bands extending nearly over the whole surface of the lens,
  but not assuming any definite form, nor did the breadth or
                                         j
 direction of any of these bands bear the slightest relation to
 the situation of the rings; their curvature varied materially
 with a variation in the pressure; and their breadth changed
 from the same cause.       Having satisfied myself that these ap
,pearances were not owing to any films, or particles of dust,                                I
 endeavoured to obtain them by reflection, and succeeded
 equally well.    In examining them with glass of different thick
 ness, the magnitude and curvature of the bands differed ma
 terially for the same degree of pressure, and it appeared that
 for extent of surface and brilliancy of colour, two pieces of
 plate glass of equal thickness are the best. These effects were
 observed by the light of a candle, and on the following day
I  found that they were not produced by the sunlight until re
 ceived into a darkened room through a very small orifice, when
 the maximum effect was
                                                                                           is its

from London to Sheerness t, had been constructed of equal

feet from the mural circlef.        The cross wires of the (thirty
inch)  telescope   of the level being  adjusted to the sidereal focus,

wire      the level was adjusted for collimation, and the great
telescope fixed         the (mean) horizontal point
                        at                                   the circle,         of

the formation of the instrument the scale adopted is the divi"
sion of the octave into 53 divisions, instead of which I should
have said the true or mathematical division.                 So far I admit
the writer may very probably be correct, as the circumstance
depends altogether on the mode in which it has been tuned,
and not on       its
                  mechanical construction. But when, after stating
himself more than once that the difference between the true
or mathematical division and that which divides the octave
      53  equal parts                             quite inappreciable,  be                                       he

 thematical or accurate sounds, presents only 16 ordinary sounds
 or finger-keys in the octave on any one finger-board.”                 But
 it should be observed that these 16 finger-keys form only a
part of the general scale of 29 sounds or finger-keys, and are
 insufficient for the completion of the limited number of keys,
 viz. from five sharps to four flats inclusive, to which the ca
 pabilities of the instrument are said to extend. It cannot be
 supposed by any sensible person that the “ordinary” finger
 keys constitute the impediment to which I allude in my essay,
 and it must certainly be conceded that the 13 extra additional
 finger-keys, which make up the 29 sounds, must increase very
 materially the difficulties of the execution in the cases for
 which they are required, i.e. in the cases in which the instru
 ment asserts             its

XLVI.         On a New Rotative Steam-Engine. By                              John Taylor,
                    Esq., F.R.S., Treas. G.S., &c.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
    T  is very well known to those who have observed the duty
     of steam-engines employed in the mines of Cornwall, that
an enormous difference has existed between those which raise
water by a reciprocating motion, and those which for other
purposes have that motion converted into a rotative one by
the intervention of a crank.         The cause of this difference has
often been    speculated   upon,   but has not,                      I
                                                     believe, been well
explained: it is important in an oeconomical point of view, as
while in the pumping engines 60 millions pounds are com
monly raised one foot by each bushel of coal consumed, the
rotative engines for stamping ores have seldom raised more
than 20 mi<U+017F><U+017F>ions; and those for winding up the ores from un
derground are found to be even far below this in effect.
      ow, it should be observed that the pumping-engines are
at present universally,        I
                              believe, single engines, that is to say,
receiving the steam from the boiler on one side of the piston
only, the principle of working double, as it is called, which was
introduced by Mr.Watt, having been for some time discarded;
and in these single engines the method of working high pres
sure steam expansively, which we owe to Mr. Woolf, has long            -
been used with the greatest advantage.
    The rotative engines in Cornwall, like                           all
                                                      others which are
used for manufacturing purposes, are double engines, and re
ceive the steam alternately above and below the piston; and
though attempts have been made               work them expansively,
                                                          to
these   attempts   have not been     very successful.

   This engine is at work at the Charles Town United mines
near St. Austell; it was erected for us under the direction of
Mr. Sims, an engineer of great experience in Cornwall. It
differs from the general construction in being a single engine,
having the beam loaded at the outer end; and the rotatory
motion of the crank is rendered almost completely uniform by
the assistance of the fly-wheels.        It works nearly as expan
sively as the pumping-engines.
    It was predicted, I understand, before the engine went to
work, that a steady rotative motion could not be produced in
this way, and some believed that the crank would never pass
the centre; I can, however, bear witness that the action is ex
tremely good, and will, I believe, by a little alteration in the
weight and diameter of the fly-wheels, be made perfect; and
as it must be an object to save at least one half the fuel or
dinarily consumed,                 I
                           point it out as deserving attention and
inquiry. I have desired that            performance mayits     regu                       be
larly reported      the  monthly

strata of tabular flints, placed at distances from each other,
varying from three to eight feet. At Swaffham two layers
occur but twenty inches asunder*; here also the tabular flints
are of great magnitude, many of them being eight or more
feet in length, and from nine to twelve inches in thickness.
Many nodules of flint are interspersed throughout the chalk,
the majority of them small, and receiving their form from a
zoophitic nucleus; larger flints thus situated are less fre
quent: the Paramoudra is very rare,               I have seen but one;
but at Thornham the chalk “contains enormous Paramou
draef.” . At Hilborough the uppermost layer of flint, at the
depth of twelve feet from the surface, is a thin seam, varying
in thickness from one eighth to an inch, some of the thicker
parts having the appearance of two thin plates cemented to
gether; about eighteen inches below this occurs a layer of
nodular and cylindrical flints, running horizontally, and pa
rallel to the seam.          Similar thin seams were observed near
Wells by Mr. Woodward, “traversing the chalk, both in a
horizontal and oblique direction; and in many parts they do
not exceed one eighth of an inch in thickness f.”                 I found
also at Thetford thin tabular flint, not more than half an inch
 in thickness; the first layer occurs at about ten or twelve feet
 below the surface, and lies parallel to the stratification of the
 chalk: the lime-burner informed me that at the depth of twenty
 feet three layers of similar flint succeed each other at about
 a yard asunder, and that the flint is invariably found fractured
 in every direction.         Each slab of flint appeared to be formed
 of two      plates  in apposition,   the flint in the line of junction
 being of a lighter shade: this character was very apparent
 upon the recently fractured surfaces.             In one instance   I ob
 served     drusy   crystals  of quartz  between the   plates.  Does not
 this laminated structure offer an illustration of the mode of
  formation and arrangement of the flinty strata? and does it
  not favour the opinion, that the siliceous molecules, by elective
  attraction, separate themselves from the calcareous matter,
  above and below certain parallels determined by the proportion
  of silex contained in the chalk, and approach each other until
  they arrange themselves in the tabular form $ 2

more of the cylindrical form than the nodular; many of them
are from eighteen to twenty-four inches in length, and are
covered with numerous irregularly formed asperities: these
flints are scattered through the chalk like the nodules at other
localities.
    At Litcham the layers of flint are placed from four to six
feet asunder; their horizontal course is not a plane, but slightly
undulating: at the depth of twenty feet a double row occurs,
the two layers being about nine inches asunder.
    Our flint is of various shades, from black to gray, and has
frequently, in addition to the white coating and lighter zones
common to flints, small white circles upon their outer surface,
the presence of which I cannot account for.             Many flints ex
hibit elegant arborizations on their fractured surface, the stone
separating more readily where these vegetations                    occur;        (?)
similar dendrites are seen on       chalk,   and  always    between the
natural divisions of the mineral these beautiful dendritic con

   Mineral Contents.-Drusy       crystals of quartz, with botry
oidal and mammillated     chalcedony,   both found lining the ca
vities of flints, and  pyramidal   and rhombic crystals of car
bonate of lime, occupying the interior of shells and echini, are
the only minerals we possess: the latter are found in cavities
in the chalk in Sussex; they have not at present been dis
covered in those situations in Norfolk, that                  I
                                                    am aware of.
Calcareous tufa is deposited by the springs at Swaffham; the
interior of one of the wells was found encrusted to the depth
of thirty feet: it commenced about twenty feet from the sur
face, and portions of it were two inches in thickness; the tex
ture of some of it was porous, other portions were compact,
and the surface generally subcrystalline.
    Sulphuret of iron is abundant; it occurs for the most part
 in spherical balls, having a fibrous structure, radiating from
the centre, and terminating on the surface in tetrahedral py
ramids: they frequently inclose a Terebratula as their nucleus.
 Clusters of columnar crystals of this mineral, as figured b
 Mantell in “Fossils of the South Downs,” tab. 16. fig, 1 i.
 are found in the chalk at Swaffham.
  The black oxide of   manganese is met with at Castleacre.
I found  this black power lying in the natural separations of
the chalk, about twenty feet from the surface; it occupies both
the oblique and horizontal clefts, but is most abundant in the
latter; it is accompanied by and partly mixed with brown
oxide of iron and loose chalk.    The thickness of this bed at
Diss is 330 feet: Hunstanton lies to the west of              escarp its

these  Echinites and Testacea, which are distributed through
all the beds of the chalk, a very large proportion are the ex
uviae of young animals: full-grown animals are, in the lower
beds, comparatively rare; I may particularize the Gryphaea
globosa, Ostrea canaliculata, also the oyster so commonly at
tached to Echini, and Ananchytes hemisphaericus: thus in the
adult shells of the upper beds we possess “natural chrono
meters,” affording a measure of the period during which the
chalk deposition was in progress.

XLVIII. An         Inquiry into the Nature of the Structure of
            Rocks.    By HENRY S. BoAse, M.D., &c."
IN   the Transactions of the Geological Society, (Second Series,
   vol. iii. part 3.) just published, there is a paper from the pen
                                                                           &.
of Professor Sedgwick, “On the Structure of large Mineral
Masses”,” in which opinions are advanced ver                                                 from
those advocated in my “Treatise on Primary
   Ihave therefore been induced to enter once more on this
subject, in the hope of originating a discussion which may                                        ul
timately tend to reconcile, if possible, those points on which
we disagree. . And it fortunately happens, that of              geolo                  all
  ical speculations there     none,  perhaps,
                                          is   more    tangible   than
that concerning the nature           the structureof     rocks; none         of
which can       more readily submitted
                   be                         the test     facts; and
                                                                  to              of
none, therefore, from which we may expect                derive more         to
satisfactory results.
    The Professor,      the very first sentence
                              in                    his paper, states   of
that “all solid mineral masses must have undergone some
change since the time        their first production.”                             If         be   in
                                       as byof
                                                                                       it
tended only      imply
                    to      this, that                      all
                                            mineral masses are not
now     in
         the same state     when their incoherent materials were
originally deposited, then every one must admit the correct
ness    ofthis assertion; but                    if,

  A     detailed consideration         the subject will, however, more

    “No one supposes,” observes the Professor page 461, ubi                     at
sup: “that columnar basalt was originally built                     solid pa         up    of
 rallel jointed pillars,             or
                                that the structure          granitoid rock   of

consequences           of
                       certain anterior condition

                                      dimensions.      Contraction must
produce tension              on
                          the whole mass; and this tension, acting
mechanically, will          many instances produce joints and fis
                               in
sures, and sometimes contortions.”                On this       may        re                    be

378             Dr.  Boase's  Inquiry into the Nature
instead of equably affecting the whole mass, especially whilst
 subjected    to immense pressure. But we know that such
fissures, at or near the surface of the earth, can be, and in
numerous cases probably have been, developed by the perco
lation of water and other atmospheric causes, acting in the
 direction of previously existing joints: thus unfolding the
forms of the rock-concretions, just as the fundamental figures
of a crystalline mass are displayed by the partial action of a
chemical solvent; an analogy confirmed by the fact, that large
 blocks of granite, or the mass itself in which the joints are not
visible, may be mechanically divided into quadrangular por
tions, corresponding in form to those produced by the action
of the elements.
    This subject will    be more particularly   enlarged on    here
 after, when the joints of sedimentary rocks come under con
 sideration. But it may be proper to offer now a brief sketch
 of the structure of igneous rocks, in order to compare it with
 that of other formations, and to test the opinion which I
 have elsewhere advanced, “that the structure of rocks is not
 dependent on any one particular mode of formation, for each
 individually, whether igneous or aqueous, by placing the mo
 bile particles under circumstances favourable to the exertion
of cohesion, effects the same object by different means.”
    When igneous rocks occur in large masses, they are found
 to be traversed by systems of parallel joints or fissures, by
which the whole mass is divided into blocks, varying in size
 and figure according to the nature of the rock.         Sometimes
 the forms of the resulting blocks are very irregular; but at
other times they possess such a surprising symmetry of           di
                      i.
mensions that they deserve to be termed crystals. A closer
inspection shows          the minerals of which these blocks are
composed, are frequently so arranged as to produce coarse,
fine-grained, and other varieties of rocks.           hese varieties
 either occur together, side by side, in layers both parallel and
regular, and even unequal in size, and variously convoluted;
or they are disposed in nodular and spheroidal concretions;
or they assume the appearance of veins. All these arrange
ments vary much in their dimensions and directions: some
times they are so small as to be confined to individual blocks;
but more commonly they extend through several adjacent
blocks; and not unfrequently they prevail over considerable
masses.      In the last case, the layers and veins will be found
to  affect, positions  parallel to the principal joints or fissures.
Under the same head must be placed the lamellar and slaty
structure, as also resulting from a peculiar arrangement of the

    After alluding          St. Austel Moor, the Professor adds:

  of the [Royal Cornwall Geological] Society's Transactions,

                    in         virtually retracted the notion that the

 work      on“Primary Geology,” excluded this series altogether

     Having said thus much              my own justification,
                                                    in             proceed                           I
  to    consider      “the        changes which mechanical stratified                                         rocks"

                        of the        Structure          of Rocks.                            381
have   undergone since their deposition, which is the chief                                   ob
ject of the Professor's paper.
     These changes he classes under two heads, the chemical
and mechanical. The former are illustrated by the globular
and concretionary structure of sedimentary rocks, such as
the nodular flints in chalk, the globular concretions of calc
grit in oolite, the nodules and spheroidal masses in magne
sian limestone, and the balls of nearly pure quartz in the
felspathic slates of Wales.                            -
     These    concretions,   with the    exception   of the last, are cer
tainly instances of a peculiar structure, assumed since the de
position of the incoherent materials of which the rocks were
 formed; but the Professor admits (at p. 467.) that the felspar
 slates may have resulted from igneous fusion, and “that they
 ought, in that case, to be removed into another class, and ar
 ranged with the orbicular granite of Corsica, and other con
 cretionary trappeam rocks.”            Now, this appears me to be an
 unnecessary distinction, for the globular concretions of rocks,
 in formations of      all
                         kinds and ages, haveprobably resulted from
 the same process, viz. the aggregation              their particles during
                                                                   of
 consolidation;        asitwould seem “that all that            requisite for     is
 such   an    arrangement             is,
                                    that the   integrant   particles      the                of
 rocks have the necessary degree                         of
                                               motion among themselves
 during the lapidification; but the manner                    which this      in                    is
 attained does not appear                           be
                                            on to
                                          material.”
      We are, then, agreed            the fact, that the globular concre
 tions  of   sedimentary    rocks are indications             change which
                                                                         of   a
  these rocks have experienced since their deposition; indeed,
I    have also already stated that “the spheroidal and concen
  tric arrangements          of
                             the laminae        the sandstone
                                                          in         Dunbar             at
  have probably been superinduced since the accumulation                                            of
  their original incoherent materials.”             But we widely differ
  concerning the cause                of
                                     these peculiar productions.         The
   Professor mentions, over and over again, that the cause                                          is
   chemical; whereas         Ihave attributed            mechanical action,
                                                                   it   to
                                                         “It

   ledged principle,”        he
                              says, “that when different substances                                 in
 a     state of   extreme comminution are mechanically mixed
   together, they have            tendency

   themselves     in  masses more      nearly  homogeneous.        The sepa
    rationof    the pounded flint from the aluminous earth,                the               in
    materials prepared for the potteries, has been several times
    quoted   as   aninstance        be of
                                   this kind                  of
                                                  chemical action.”
       Surely this cannot         called      instance   an chemical action, of
       which particles       toof
                               like nature, placed        sensible distances,

  382                   Dr. Boase's Inquiry into    the Nature
   cal affinity, and of the attraction of aggregation, very clearly
   point out the difference between these powers; and they must
   not, as in the case of geological terms, be treated as “mere
   affectation”; for definitions are, as aptly styled by Greenough,
   the standard weights and measures of scientific intercourse.
      The Professor next enters on the most important part of his
   paper, concerning the “transverse cleavage of slate rocks,”
   as deduced from his investigations in Cumberland and Wales.
   This cleavage he also considers to have been produced by
   chemical action; and, that it is the only true cleavage, making
   with the planes of stratification an average angle of from 30°
   to 40°, being in no instance parallel to the true beds, though
   sometimes making an angle therewith as low as 10°, and even
   as 6°.   De la Beche has stated that cleavage planes are some
   times at right angles to the strata; but the Professor is of
   opinion that he has confounded cleavage-planes with joints,
   of which he treats under a separate head. He also thinks
   that the Continental geologists have not duly appreciated the
  transverse cleavage; and that some English writers do not
  always distinguish between a jointed and slaty structure, but
  seem to consider a laminated structure parallel to the strata
  as one of the cases of a slaty structure.          These, however, he
  contends    ought  never to be     confounded;    for “they have little
  in  common;     can,  in ninety-nine    instances out of a hundred, be
  distinguished even in hand-specimens; and ought to be desig
  nated by separate names.”
     This supposed facility of drawing distinctions between the
  two kinds of structure has induced the Professor to offer de
  finitions of them, notwithstanding his wonted dislike to such
  labours.     “Before I conclude this section,” he observes at
  p. 479,    “I cannot help recommending, not a new nomencla
  ture, but a more systematic use of old terms than we are ac
 customed         to.

  On the Solution of Numerical Equations: translated byW.H. Spiller,
   from a Memoir of M. C. Sturm, presented to the Royal Academy
    of Sciences of Paris. 4to.                   J.
                                 Souter, London; Bachelier, Paris.
 Th;         mémoire, of which the present publication of Mr. Spiller is
         a translation, was printed in Paris about three months ago, in the
 sixth volume of “Mémoires               présentés par des Savans etrangers."
 It   forms the most valuable addition to our knowledge of the theory
 of numerical equations that has been made since the time of La
 grange; in fact, it fully accomplishes the great object which, from
  Descartes till now, has engaged the thoughts of mathematicians
 in this department of analysis, and which is no other than the com
 plete determination of the number and situation of the real roots
 of every numerical equation, a problem to which the labours of La
 grange were, as is well known, especially directed.                    The success
 of these labours, however, extended no further than to show that
 the solution of the problem in question was mathematically possible,
 although practically nearly impossible, on account of the mass of
 numerical labour, and the consequent risk of error, involved in the
 method which he proposed.
    As a means, therefore, of facilitating the actual evolution of the
 real roots of numerical equations of the higher order, the process
 of Lagrange was entirely useless. Very recently, however, the re
 searches of Budan and Fourier have proved that the rule of signs
 of Descartes was far more comprehensive than had hitherto been
 supposed; and that by employing it in                    full extent, its  was ca          it
 pable    of  furnishing much more explicit information respecting the
 nature       ofthe roots          of   an
                                     equation than had          yet been expected
                                                                             as
 from    it. Still these additional advantages did not reach the length                                of
 supplying          with the exact number
                    us                                       of
                                                   real roots comprised between
any two proposed limits, and yet nothing short                     this knowledge of

                             answer the demands          the practicalof computer.
    It   is true that the last-named mathematician, Fourier,                      his            in
                   work entitled      “Analyse     des  Equations    déterminées,”
   as  pushed his inquiries beyond those                              of
                                                         Budan, and has added

                                             of

and d in different elastic media, we shall have data for ascertaining
their relative capacities for caloric. Such a method, however, though
theoretically exact, is beset with difficulties so great that it may be
considered as practically impossible. The artificial gases, as usually
collected, are saturated with moisture, a state in which they are
quite unsuited for the necessary experiments; and even though this
difficulty were overcome, it would probably be impossible to deter
mine their dew-points by direct experiment.

   A bare inspection of this table would seem to justify the conclusion
that, with a single exception, the different gases operated with have,
under equal volumes, specific heats proportional to their specific gra
vities; and of course that, under equal weights, they have the same
specific heat.   In the excepted case, that of hydrogen, the specific
heat is nearly the double of that which would result from this law.
   On the absence   of Magnetism in Cast Iron when in fusion. By
                              R. W. Fox.
      In the course of some magnetic experiments, it appeared to the
author desirable to ascertain whether a magnetic needle is acted
upon by cast iron in a state of fusion.      For this purpose he had a
horizontal mould made in sand, about five feet long and two inches
square, in the direction of the magnetic meridian; and at a very
small distance from                its
                          northern extremity, and parallel                                  to   it,   he
placed the south pole                  of
                               delicately poised magnetic needle, the
                                            a
north pole      which extended beyond the mould.
               of                                          The latter was
then filled with very fluid melted iron, but not the slightest effect
was produced            on
                   the needle till after the metal had become fixed
and cooled down         cherry-red colour. The needle was then very

  peared to be most considerable on the iron in the immediate vicinity
  of the lead, where it was about one eighth of an inch deep, and the
  metal was so much indented as to exhibit a coarse fibrous structure.
  So rapidly had the iron-work corroded in about six months, that
  had it continued at the same rate for two years the buoys (in the
  opinion of competent judges) would have been quite unfit for the public
 service.      The copper and lead attached to the buoys were in a good
 state of   preservation.
     The extraordinary corrosion of the iron-work appeared to be due
  to an electrical action produced in sea water by the contact of the
  iron with the lead joined to the copper, on the buoys; these metals
 being preserved at the expense of the iron.              The author submitted
 his views on the subject to the Commissioners, and suggested the
 propriety of removing a circle of about three or four inches of lead
 from the iron-work at the bottom of each buoy, and of driving two
 or three short large-headed iron nails through the remaining lead
 into the wood, in order to protect both the lead and copper covering
 of the buoys from corrosion. These suggestions being promptly car
 ried into effect, the author has during the last twelve months had
 frequent opportunities of examining the state of the iron-work at
 tached to, and in the immediate vicinity of, the buoys, and he states
 that the removal of the lead has put a stop to the very rapid corro
 sion of the iron-work.

will exhibit an incipient oxidation, which will gradually increase;
the tin will be preserved at the expense of the iron, which will be
corroded.    But if a small surface of zinc is attached to a piece of
tin plate and immersed in sea-water, both the tin and iron will be
preserved, whilst the zinc will be oxidated, on the principle first
made known by the late Sir H. Davy.
   The author has exposed for nearly eight months in sea-water a
surface of tin plate nailed to a piece of wood by means of tinned iron
tacks, inserting between the wood and the tin plate a small button
of zinc.      Under these circumstances the tin plate has remained
clean and free from corrosion; the zinc has of course been corroded.
In a comparative experiment, in which a similar piece of                  plate                       tin
                                       wood, and exposed during the same

On the comparative value of Irish and Virginian Tobacco.                By
   EDMUND    DAvy,   F.R.S.,    M.R.I.A.,  &c.,   Professor of  Chemistry
   to the Royal Dublin Society.
   In the year 1829–30 the cultivation of tobacco in Ireland excited
much attention among agriculturists, and several hundred acres of
it were raised in different counties; in consequence, the attention of
the Royal Dublin Society was directed to the subject, and the author
was requested by a select committee of that body to institute ex

baryta salt, and apparently containing two atoms of water; but Pro
fessor Kane has not determined the exact circumstances necessary
to the production of this form, and consequently       examination yet                    its

   Professor Johnston stated verbally the results of his analysis of
the single and double iodides of gold, results which he found to
correspond generally with those already obtained for the chloride.
   Professor GRAHAM gave an account of some recent researches
which he has published in reference to the constitution of certain
compounds as far as respects their constituent water.    He illus
trated his views by sulphuric acid, with 1 and 2 atoms of water,
by oxalic acid with 1 and 3 atoms of water, and by nitric acid
containing 1 and 4 atoms of water.    Other compounds were also
adduced, such as oxalate of magnesia, which contains two atoms of
water, or that which may be considered as the water of crystalliza
tion of oxalic acid. The oxalate, binoxalate, and quadroxalate of
potash, and several other saline compounds were also brought for
ward in explanation of his views.

  He then drew attention to ammonia, which he considered as fre
quently performing the function of water in saline compounds; a
view which he impressed upon the Section by drawing attention to
the composition of the sulphate and of two distinct ammoniurets of
copper.
On a new method of testing the presence of Muriatic Acid in    Hydro
           cyanic Acid.     By Professor GEoghegan.
  This proceeding is essentially preliminary to the adoption of the
usual modes of determining the strength of any given specimen of
this agent. The insoluble compounds into which the chlorine of
muriatic acid enters, and by the formation of which chemists usually
recognise     its
               presence, are known       resemble,
                                        to          inmany respects,
those to  which  cyanogen  gives rise when  combining  with the same
bases.   The method proposed    by  Dr. Geoghegan     founded
                                                     is         onthe

been analysed by Liebig, and subsequently by Dr. Apjohn", is easily
prepared by mixing, in the proportion of atom and atom, the iodide
of potassium and bicyanide of mercury, each dissolved in a small
quantity of hot water.        After a short time silvery scales (resem
bling acetate of mercury) are formed, which constitute the salt in
                                                                                                                              as of all

soaked for some time in very dilute sulphuric acid, consisting of 150
grains of the sulphuric acid of commerce, in a quart of water. The
iron is obtained in solution, and the ammonia if any exist in the turf.
The fibre is now again separated by pressure from the dilute acid,
and digested in the cold, with dilute solution of chloride of lime, of
the strength commonly used by paper-makers to bleach fine rags.
After the bleaching has taken place the fibre is strained from the
liquor, well washed, and applied to the manufacturer's purposes.
    The extremely dark-coloured solution obtained by the caustic
alkali is now treated with an excess of dilute sulphuric acid, and
the acid of the previous washings may be in part used by the
manufacturer for this purpose.              The alkali is neutralized, and the
geine precipitates.      It is collected on a filter or by other suitable
means, and well washed with cold water, and finally dried by a
steam bath, after which, if perfectly dried, it ceases to be soluble
in water. It may now be used either in oils or distemper as a
 colour, being a rich brown bistre.
    The solution from which it has been separated contains sulphate
of potass, and occasionally, in very minute quantity, sulphate of am
 monia.
    The quantity of soluble matter in the turf operated on was found
 from 14 to 30 per cent.; and from one hundred weight of turf of
 proper quality may be obtained about 18 pounds of fine white fibre
fit  for paper-making, and much larger proportion

The sound ceased at the moment that the flame was extinguished.
   The pressure of gas used in most of the experiments was that of
the ordinary main-pipes in this city, about 13 inch of water; that
of the current of air, which was produced by a good pair of double
bellows, was equal to the pressure of a column of (2% inches of)
mercury; but it    was found that no material alteration of effect took
place from condensing the gas to about two atmospheres, and cau
sing it to issue inflamed at that pressure, provided the pressure of
the current of air was likewise increased in the same ratio nearly.
   With a less powerful stream of air than was above stated, the
effects were imperfectly produced; and with a much more powerful
one the flame was blown out.
   The temperature of the current of air heated by the flame, when
it retracted best, was found, at the distance of four inches from the
burner, to be 482°Fahrenheit, or perhaps a little higher. The com

  The general saving on the average he       stated to be no more than
10s. per ton, and observed,    that the price of such iron in the market
had actually fallen from 15s. to 20s. per ton, while that from cold air
at the same time rose 5s. per ton in Yorkshire. (This statement gave
rise to observations on the part of several gentlemen, who dissented
from Mr. Hartop, and stated that the reduction in price of iron
from hot air had not occurred in other parts of the country, and
that, as prepared in Glasgow and many other places, it had not been
so deteriorated.     It has in consequence been adopted in every
smelting-house in Scotland, and the annual produce of the works
in that country during the last ten years has been nearly doubled.
   Reference was also made to processes adopted in the Russian
smelting-works, which showed that by a judicious adjustment of the
quantities of cold air introduced by the blast, a saving could be ef
fected approaching even to that obtained by the use of hot air.)

   1. As the precipitation of the ammoniacal phosphate of mag
nesia is accelerated and made manifest by drawing lines with a blunt
glass rod on the internal sides of the glass vessel in which the proper
mixture is made for producing the precipitate, a fact first noticed
by the late Dr. Wollaston, so in a similar manner the separation
of bitartrate of potash from any mixture containing potash, to which
tartaric acid has been added in proper quantity, will be accelerated
and rendered manifest by drawing lines with pressure on the inter
nal sides of the vessel with a glass rod, the crystals of bitartrate first
attaching themselves to these lines.
   2. That nitrate of lead like the nitrate of baryta is precipitated
from water by addition of strong nitric acid, which in each case ex
erts a similar action, namely, that of abstracting - the water from the
salt.                                                               -

 ignorance and wilfulness of the workmen, proposes, for the securit
 of the lamp from injury and mismanagement, that the body of it
should be formed of a strong spherical glass, furnished with a cop
per tube above and below, and that surfaces of wire gauze should
be placed at these points, protected by parallel metallic plates, so as
to be inaccessible to the workmen. The glass is defended externally
by strong arched wires. It is also provided that the upper and lower
parts of the lamp should be connected by means of a spring, so as to
permit of a sliding motion, for the purpose of deadening in one                                            di

deposits formerly        supposed by Dr. Forchhammer to exist in the
Danish islands.        In a memoir published in the “Edinburgh Philoso
phical Journal of Science" for July 1828, Dr. Forchhammer had de
scribed the white chalk of Seeland as covered by a coralline lime
stone, and had imagined the white chalk of Möen to be a formation
higher in the series than this coralline limestone.              He had also con
sidered certain deposits of blue clay, sand, and gravel, seen in the
cliffs of Möen, as alternating with the white chalk.                           -
    Mr. Lyell examined, in company with Dr. Forchhammer, the cliffs
of Seeland and Möen, during the summer of 1834, and the following
are the results at which he has arrived. The two formations of which
Denmark and Danish Holstein chiefly consist, are, chalk, and an over
lying tertiary deposit. Part of the latter resembles in composition the
argillaceous and sandy beds of the English crag. Another part cor
responds with deposits usually called diluvial, especially those asso
ciated with the English crag, in parts of Norfolk. Large erratic
blocks are also strewed over the surface of Denmark, connected with,
and sometimes buried in, the gravel or “diluvium". In some sec
tions on the banks of the Elbe, the yellow tertiary sands are divided
regularly into thin strata, and are exposed for a thickness of about
200 feet. Unstratified masses of blue clay, of great thickness, are
also there seen, in which gravel, containing     t
                                                        every kind of rock, from
granite to chalk, occurs.
    There is often an abrupt passage from the stratified to the unstra
tified parts of the formation, which the author compares to the Nor
folk and Suffolk crag, from            general appearance, but without pre

     The shells at Faxoe are chiefly in the state of casts, and among
 them are several species of Cypraea, Conus, Mitra, and Voluta, as
 also an Ammonite, a Patella, a Fusus, and a Cerithium.         Upon the
 whole, there are in the collection of Prince Christian of Denmark
  132 species of fossil shells from the Faxoe beds, of which 26 have
 been ascertained by Dr. Beck to be identical with chalk species, while
 the rest are distinct from them, but do not agree with known tertiary
 shells.
     Lastly, the author considers the relations of the chalk of Möen
                     .
 with the tertiary strata of that island.   The white cliffs of Möen are
 from 300 to 400 feet in height, consisting of chalk and parallel layers
 of nodular flint, the strata having been violently disturbed; so that
 instead of being nearly horizontal, as at Stevensklint, they are curved,
 and often vertical,      upon the whole, more deranged than the chalk
 of Purbeck and the Isle of Wight.                                       -
     The  range of lofty cliffs in Möen is divided into  separate masses
 by ravines, which often intersect them from top to bottom, but are
 in great part filled up with tertiary clay and sand, masses of which
 appear to have subsided bodily into large fissures and chasms of the
 fractured chalk. In consequence of these disturbances the chalk has
 been made to alternate on a great scale with interposed and uncon
 formable strata of clay and sand. These alternations cannot be ex
 plained by supposing the detritus of the superincumbent strata to
 have been washed in by running water into clefts; but masses of the
 tertiary beds seem rather to have been engulfed.       Several drawings
 illustrating these dislocations accompany the memoir, and the ap
pearances are compared to those exhibited by the chalk, nearly enve
loped by crag, near Trimingham in Norfolk, although the entangle
 ment of the two formations there, is on a smaller scale.
     Dr. Forchhammer now agrees with the author in the principal con
 clusions above enumerated, and has discovered the disturbed chalk
 of Möen in the South of Seeland, as also the Faxoe beds overlying
chalk in Mors, an island of the Lym Fiord.
     A paper was afterwards read, “On a peculiarity of Structure in the
 Neck of Ichthyosauri, not hitherto noticed;” by Sir Philip Grey
Egerton, Bart., M.P., V.P.G.S.                                             -
     Miss Anning of Lyme Regis discovered, a short time since, in a
thin bed of lias shale, near that town, a large portion of the skeleton
of a new gigantic species of Ichthyosaurus. Among these interesting
remains are the anterior cervical vertebrae, together with an occipital
bone, and it is to the peculiarity of structure which they present that
Sir Philip Egerton principally confines his observations. The occipital
bone, he says, on the authority of Mr. Owen, proves very satisfac
torily the permanent separation of the basilar element of the occiput
Mr. Lyell’s paper, that the “Faxoe limestone”, occupies an inferior posi
tion in the series to the tertiary beds which Mr. Lyell compares to the
“argillaceous and sandy beds of the English crag,” termed by Mr. Charles
worth the upper or red crag. Mr. Lyell’s paper was read, before Mr.

in individuals of the fullest growth and largest size, evincing a very
languid circulation in this family of reptiles. The atlas and axis of
Ichthyosauri, the author states, are usually found adhering together,
the connexion between them being so intimate that it is rarely pos
sible to disunite them ; and when this has been effected, the surfaces
have borne the appearance of fracture more frequently than that of
natural division. In one instance in which he succeeded in separating
the two bones, the articulating surfaces were nearly even, and with
out cup. This union of the two vertebrae appears to have received ad
ditional strength from a small bone which articulated with the under
circumference of the atlas and axis, showing, as the author observes,
that in the anterior region of the spinal column strength and not la
titude of motion was required.        This bone is a nearly circular, solid,
umbonated disc; the central projection being on the inferior or ex
ternal surface, while the upper is depressed anteriorly and posteriorly
for the purpose of articulating with the atlas and axis, the two sur
faces being divided by a transverse elevation corresponding with the
line of union of the vertebrae. The atlas and axis have their circum
ferences prolonged in the form of two tangents meeting at an obtuse
angle on the under surface. These processes are truncated, and form,
when the vertebrae are in apposition, a triangular depression for the
reception of the two articulating surfaces of the interspinous bone.
 Sir Philip Egerton states that Mr. Owen has informed him, that a
bone somewhat analogous in position, although not in form, occurs
 in some recent saurians. The apparently two succeeding vertebrae
 present, at the lower part of their articulating surfaces, an alternating
 elevation and depression, fitting into each other so exactly, as to limit,
 to a great extent, the motion between the bones. Some of the other
 cervical vertebrae are also remarkable for the flatness of their surfaces,
 the intervertebral cavities being nearly obliterated.       In conclusion,
 the author says, that the conditions under which the atlas and axis
 are found; the existence of an auxiliary bone connecting the two ;
 the form of the articulating surfaces of the cervical vertebrae, and the
 consequent contraction of the intervertebral cavities,        tend all

 chison, Esq., V.P.G.S.
    The author refers       toformer memoirs, read before the Society,                   in
 which  he   pointed out the existence      certain bedded trap rocks, in
                                            of
 terstratified with transition deposits, and     other intrusive trap rocks
                                                 of
 which have been subsequently injected amid these stratified masses.
The Breiddin Hills, west Shrewsbury, afford examples both these
                                 of                                       of
 classes of   trap rock,in  ridges running from west-south-west        east     to
 north-east, and also indicate, upon their flanks, that elevations have
 taken place along these lines, subsequently          the deposition

 adjoining coal measures.     The author has lately discovered that still
 more recent movements of elevation have been propagated along the
 same line of fissure, posterior to the consolidation of the new red
 sandstone. He was led to this observation by the unexpected dis
 covery of three small trap dykes beneath the house of Sir A. Corbet,
 Bart., at Acton Reynolds, which were accidentally laid open upon
 clearing out the foundations of that mansion.
    These dykes cut like walls through the new red sandstone, and are
 made up of a peculiar greenstone and a mottled concretionary felspar
 rock, both of which rocks occur in the Breiddin Hills. Besides this
 similarity in structure, the principal dyke has precisely the same di
 rection as the Breiddin Hills, and hence the author was induced to
 examine the intervening tract of fifteen miles by which these trap
 rocks are separated. The result has been the detection of an anti
 clinal line throughout that space, along which the strata of the new
 red sandstone are thrown off, both to the south-south-west and north
 north-east, or at right angles to the line of eruption of the trap. The
 clearest and most unequivocal point in the course of this anticlinal line
 is seen in Pim Hill, six miles north of Shrewsbury, in the centre of
 which the sandstone is compact, white, and unstratified, with slicken
sides, coatings of earthy oxide of manganese, traces of copper ores,
 vertical fissures, &c., whilst strata of unaltered sandstone dip away
 from this common centre, both to the south-south-west and north
 north-east. This point of altered rock lies exactly upon the line
 connecting the Moel y Golfa ridge of the Breiddins with the trap
 dyke of Acton Reynolds.      The line of elevation is further traceable
for about fifteen miles, to the east-north-east of Acton Reynolds,
 usually throwing the strata into only dome-shaped masses; but the
 Rev. T. Egerton has observed it passing the Liverpool and Birming
 ham canal thirty miles distant from the Breiddin Hills.
    The author is of opinion that the hilly range of new red sandstone
 extending from the Ness Cliff Hills, by the south of Wem, into the
 Hawkstone and Hodnet Hills, and then prolonged by the south of
 Market Drayton into the high grounds of Ashley Heath (parallel to
the line extending from Moel y Gol<U+017F>a through Acton Reynolds), has
 been affected by similar elevatory forces acting along a line proceed
 ing from the focus of the principal ridge of the Breiddins, or that
on which Rodney's Pillar stands; and in corroboration of this, he
alludes to the veined and metalliferous character of the red sandstone
along this line, in which copper ores, manganese, &c. are of partial
occurrence. Immense accumulations of coarse gravel and clay ob
scure the flanks, and sometimes hide, for vast spaces, the disturbed
and denuded strata of red sandstone along the chief anticlinal line.
    Attention is then directed to the position of the lower strata of the
new red; sandstone, around the coal-fields of Colebrook Dale and
South Staffordshire; and in confirmation of opinions expressed in
former communications, the author cites several examples near Wol
verhampton and Dudley, particularly one at Sedgely, where the coal
itself is thrown up at an angle of about 40°, the strike being north
and south, with the lower new red sandstone conformable to
                                                                 it;  and

 from these evidences he concludes that the principal lines of fracture
 along the margin of these coal-fields took place after the deposition
 of the new red sandstone series, and that, therefore, the break so
 prevalent in the South-west of England, between the upper part of
 the coal measures and the new red sandstone, can no longer be con
sidered as of general application in English geology.

   Colonel Sykes remarked that he had previously, while illustrating
his ‘Catalogue of the Birds of Dukhun', read before the Committee
of Science and Correspondence in 1832, shown the specific identity
of many European and Indian Birds, especially in the orders Gral
latores and Natatores.
   “Some account of a hybrid Bird between the cock Pheasant, Pha
sianus Colchicus, Linn., and the grey Hen, Tetrao Tetric, Ej., by
Thomas C. Eyton, Esq.,” was read. It was illustrated by the ex
hibition of the preserved skin of the bird, and also of a drawing
made from         it.      It   is   inserted        in   No. xxix.            of   the ‘Proceedings'                     of

   Another fact, which has since created some interest, was also                                    dis
covered by me whilst experiment

served that when         the compass
needle was placed above the poles
of the voltaic magnet, as in fig. 2.
on breaking the connexion with
the voltaic         Éatº,
                       the needle was
suddenly deflected half a revolu

   This rotatory effect well known is
to   all
       who have repeated Oersted's
original experiment,         which the

voltaic wires alone are used         af        to

 ment of precipitation, by the nitrous acid produced during the solu
 tion of the silver in the nitric acid; manganate of potash was therefore
 added to a solution of a gramme of silver and six milligrammes of
 mercury, as long as it was decolorized, and even slightly in excess;
 but the result was not satisfactory: the quantity of the silver was                                            in
 creased by about five thousandths.
     Ittherefore remained to discover the means              of ascertaining the
 presence of mercury in silver; and this was effected by observing the
 manner in which chloride of silver when pure, and when adulterated
 with mercury, is affected by light.
     It is well known that chloride of silver blackens the more readily as
 it is exposed to an intense light, and that even in the diffused light of
 a room it becomes soon sensibly coloured. If it contains four to five
 thousandths of mercury it does not blacken, it remains of a dead white;
 with three thousandths of mercury there is no marked discoloring
 in diffused light; with two thousandths it is slight; with one, it is
 much more marked, but still it is much less intense than with pure
 chloride.     With half a thousandth of mercury the difference of colour
 is not remarkable, and is perceived only in a very moderate light.
     But when the quantity of mercury is so small that it cannot be de
 tected by the difference of colour in the chloride of silver, it may be
 rendered very evident by a very simple process of concentration.
 Dissolve one gramme of silver, supposed to contain # of a thousandth
 of mercury, and only one fourth of it is to be precipitated, adding
 only # of the common salt necessary to precipitate it entirely. In
 thus operating, the # thousandth of mercury is concentrated in a
 quantity of chloride of silver four times smaller: it is as if the silver
 having been entirely precipitated, four times as much mercury, equal
 to two thousandths, had been precipitated with                                          it.

 it is of the same composition as the crystallized acid, it is evident that
 the latter contains no water of crystallization.                 In order to ascertain
 in what state pyromucic acid exists in salts, pyromucate of silver was
 analysed ; this salt was prepared by adding pyromucate of lime to a
 solution of nitrate of silver, and allowing the mixture to stand for seve
 ral days. The pyromucate was strongly pressed in filtering-paper, and                   º
 continued for a long time exposed to a temperature of 257°Fahr.
 By the analysis of this salt, the composition of the acid it contained
 appeared   to be

It appears, then,   that when it combines with bases, the sublimed acid
loses an atom of water. Hydrated pyromucic acid possesses the same
composition as the pyrocitric acid, contained in the pyrocitrates.                    In
fact, pyrocitric acid is composed of

     This analysis, it is remarked, gives us                              the constituents of gadolinite
as   follows:         12 16 atoms silica
                       8:06   — yttria

                     3.       — protoxide of iron.
  Were we to    suppose    the protoxide of iron to be an accidental                                                 in
gredient, we might consider gadolinite as composed of
                2 atoms silicate of yttria
                 1 atom   silicate of glucina and cerium;
or we   might consider it as composed of
                        l atom silicate of cerium
                        4 atoms silicate of glucina
                        8 atoms silicate of yttria.
   If the  protoxide   of iron be an essential constituent, the oxide of
cerium, glucina, and protoxide of iron must be in the state of disili
Cates.
   It is stated that benzoate of ammonia throws down glucina, which
benzoic acid does not; and that, with care, the peroxide of iron may
be completely precipitated by benzoic acid.—Thomson's Records of
Science, vol. i. p. 408.
                                     RHOD1zITE, A NEw MINERAL.

       GENTLEMEN,
THE   memoir by Sir Thomas Lauder Dick, published in
  the ninth volume of the Edinburgh Transactions, has left
the theory   of the parallel roads in Glen Roy, &c. incomplete
in only one particular, that of finding a barrier to form lakes.
After assuming that a barrier had existed, the nature of what
it consisted of presents a difficulty, and the mode of              re
                                                                                         of its

   The subject is extremely interesting; for there is doubtless
harmony between cause and effect; and there can be no phae

cause without               its

three degrees at the apex of the prism. The incidence of
the broad faces upon the adjacent faces of the prism is about
140°, and therefore these faces are inclined to one another at
an angle of 180°–148° x 2 = 64°. The crystal is terminated
by four minute planes equally inclined to the broad face and
the axis of the prism, but two of these faces often disappear,
and the crystal terminates in an oblique edge in place of a
triangular apex.

440           Mr. Fox            on the Laws         of Magnetic Attraction.
     The magnets I employed exerted only               one half their force
when from contact they were separated about the two thou
sandth of an inch from each other; one quarter their force when
the distance between them was one thousandth of an inch;
one eighth when it amounted to the five hundredth part of an
inch; and so on, in the direct inverse ratio of the distance,
until they were one eighth of an inch or more asunder; and as
they were still further removed from each other, the law of
attraction gradually approximated to the inverse ratio of the
square of the distance.
   It is well known that a magnet has a portion of                     lateral            its
force  suspended     when       poles  its
                                         are made        approach    the dis
                                                                        to
similar poles              of
                      two other magnets, and that                   reduced      it   is
to   a state       comparative neutrality when those poles are
                      of
brought into actual contact; and this                  doubtless the case
                                                                      is
with the numerous minute magnets                                  of
                                                     which loadstone dust
consists when their tendency              diverge  to  overcome,       rather

superseded,            by
                    strong opposite attractions, and they become
arranged        parallel straight lines. This arrangement takes
                 in
place     greater distances with strong magnets than with weak
         at
ones, and       like manner the law changes
                  in                                      greater distances at
in  the former case than             the latter.

volatilization of the iodine, for none could be observed upon
the sides of the upper half of the bottle, nor could the original
colour be restored on shaking the bottle, which would have
happened had the iodine been present.            I had no good means
of ascertaining   whether    nitrogen   remained in the upper half
of the  bottle, %.   as air seems to be necessary, it is most proba
ble; for supposing that three atoms of water were decomposed,
this would give rise to three atoms of hydriodic acid, whilst
two of oxygen from the air might combine with the three of
the decomposed water, and one atom of iodic acid would re
sult; thus accounting for the presence of these two acids.
   Pretty good and regular octohedral crystals of iodine may
be sometimes found imbedded in the sulphur which has been
deposited during the formation of hydriodic acid by the trans
mission of sulphuretted hydrogen through iodine suspended
in water. And very large fern-shaped [aggregates of ) crystals,

coholic solution with a large proportion of iodine; on cooling,
a splendid large crystallization presented itself.
   When chlorine gas is transmitted through a thicklysaturated
solution of iodine in alcohol, the dark colour is changed into

which at first I thought to be iodic acid; but this precipitate
is more permanent, not                       in a moist atmosphere,
nor is it in even a moderate       degree  soluble in water, thus dif
fering from iodic acid. When nitric acid is added to this
yellow liquid, no change at first takes place; but in a short
                                                                                         i.
time a considerable reaction is observed, and heat is gene

 he seems to consider that compound as an oxide of iodine, and
 that by an admixture of it with iodic acid, an iodous acid pro
 perly so called results; this last is a liquid of an amber co
 lour, and is the result of definite proportions only. From my
 experiments I think that the latter is the correct opinion; but
 my iodous acid is solid, whilst both of the former combina
 tions are liquid.       I most punctually followed the directions
given by M. Sementini for the formation of his first iodous
acid. I had the salt in excess, and on the application of heat
 there soon appeared a dense cloud of white vapour, which
condensed into white flakes in the receiver. Soon after this
 the darker iodous vapours appeared, which also condensing,
trickled down, and remained liquid in the bottom of the vessel
for some time. I poured some of this into a small phial, and
soon after it concreted into a solid mass.              It fused at a very
low temperature, and did not solidify again                      long time.     for   a

insoluble        the latter, and consequently precipitated.            Since
reading Sementini's last letter, however, think that the solid
iodous acid just described           the result
                                            is         the union    of Iiodic                 of

                                 of         the same  is    his last iodous as
acid, only more concentrated. The reason that Sementini's
result was different was this; he did not exclude the air from
his, consequently being exceedingly deliquescent,                  attracted          it
moisture, and          only saw

                                         the Professor informs                 that                        us
 “sometimes              all

 of  slate without seeing          single trace

     It therefore follows, that the apparently self-evident ques

 4.46              Dr. Boase's Inquiry into                     the Nature
“may be carried on indefinitely, or at           least as far as the opera
 tion is not  interrupted   by  a mere mechanical difficulty.” Again,
 “should    any    one assert that the subdivision of slate-rocks into
 rhombohedral solids implies three planes of cleavage, we might
 reply, that such solids are not capable of indefinite subdivision
 into similar solids, except in one direction, viz. that of true
 cleavage; and in this way we may generally distinguish the true
 cleavage planes from the joints.” Now we are also informed (at
 p.477.)that “the cleavage planespassalike through                 thestrata,         all
 the coarse beds and the finer, the twisted and the straight.”
                        º
 We might be led from this conclude that all these strata are
                                                to
 susceptible       of
                   indefinite subdivision; but such mistake would           a
 be  corrected      inthe page following, which states that “where
 the slaty cleavage        very perfectly brought out, the structure

 This contradictory            the preceding statements, for

intersect all the strata.
  It   appears, then, that the proposed restriction                    “old                 of
terms”   is not well adapted for practical purposes; and for this
simple reason, because the definitions              these terms require
                                                                 of                                    a

    We therefore contend that the slaty cleavage                  rocks has       of
not necessarily any connexion with

450               Dr.      Boase's          Inquiry into the Nature
neous rocks, we are told that the slate in contact with the
granite “has been modified by a similar crystalline action in
passing into a solid state.”         Now, in the preceding pages it
had been laid down that the folia of schists which are parallel
to the strata, are not true slates, but laminae or thin beds ;
the difference being, that one is supposed to have been formed
by crystalline action, the other by deposition. The demon
stration of this proposition has therefore failed in the case of
the Carclaze slate, and through it in                    parallel cases, by all
leading    tothe contradictory conclusion that laminae are not
laminae, but slates; that              that      is,
                                                  perfect         acrystalline               or

                      in                                these terms. This   of
result, however,        satisfactory, for
                             is                            accordance with

heads,   the molecular, concretionary, and jointed structures,
thinking that there was evidence of these three stages suc
ceeding each other during the consolidation of rocks.                      It
was then also stated that stratified rocks formed from sedi
mentary deposits, possessed, when solidified, similar structures,
effected by the same cause, viz. the agency of the attraction of
aggregation.       The first stage of consolidation is already ac
complished in deposits of sand, gravel, pebbles, and the like;
for the molecules are united into distinct bodies: these, in the
next place, are combined into various concretional forms, such
as nodules, spheroids, angular and venous portions, and, per
haps, laminae and slates, though these last are so intimately
connected with the jointed structure that I am not inclined
to separate them from                And      may
                                               it.       here remarked,
                                                                     it                  be
that      the joints,
            as             igneous rocks, sometimes traverse large
                                     in
crystals formed during the first                molecular stage,          or                                     so   in
some    sedimentary      rocks   they  occasionally   intersect the pre
viously existing pebbles and fragments                which these rocks             of
are  composed.
   On this view        the subject, no distinction

   Before concluding, permit me             make few remarks      in to
                                                                                     a                           on   a

                 of                         which      has offered some              he

suggestions without alluding to their having been already          pro
                                            -
pounded.
     Thus,at page 483, he observes that          “if
                                              the grain of gra
nite rocks be  produced  by a modification of crystalline action,
similar to that which  produced   slaty cleavage, have we not
some reason to expect that the grain of such rocks may be
traced along their lines of protrusion ? I throw this out as a
mere conjecture, suggested by an analogy, and by the fact
that the veined structure of the St. Austle granite is nearly
parallel to the direction of the Cornish slates.”
   Now in a paper read before the [Royal Cornwall Geologi
cal) Society in the years 1830 and 1831, and published in the
Transactions in 1832, I stated that the masses of granite di
vided into layers by seams or joints, are sometimes perpen
dicular, but more frequently inclined at various angles from
45° to 80°; and that they only differ from the layers or strata
of    the adjoining slate, in the one being fissile and the other
mot; in short, that they both possess the same concretionary
structure, the result probably of a peculiar crystalline ar
rangement of their constituent minerals;–and lastly, that beds
of granitic rocks, forming integrant parts of the central      masses,
sometimes extend beyond the boundaries thereof, and alter
nate with the slate.       Again, in my “Treatise on Primary
Geology,” I have often dwelt on this topic, showing that the
layers of granite vary in composition and alternate together
precisely after the same manner as the crystalline slates; that
they have often determinate directions, as recorded by several
observers in different countries; that even when the joints are
 not visible they may be cleft most easily in directions parallel
therewith, as pointed out by Mr. Enys; and lastly, which is
 to the point, that “the direction or strike of these granitic beds
 is placed in a certain and determinate position, which in Corn
 wall is parallel to the most frequent course of the adjacent schis
 tose rocks.”     For further details on this subject the 6th, 10th,
 12th, and 16th chapters may be more particularly consulted.
    The Professor next adds:        “It  would be well, in a place
 like Cornwall, to institute a set of direct observations, for the
 purpose of comparing the grain of the granite with the direc
 tion of the nearest metalliferous veins.        As so many rocks
 are intersected    by  cross joints, nearly  perpendicular  to their
 strike, we might expect, d priori, to find many great “master
joints, nearly at right angles to the direction of the granitic
 ridge of Cornwall. At     all   events, whether such reasoning     be
 good    or bad, there are many great “master joints'         or
                                                               ‘cross

   Now, it has been a long- and well-established fact in Corri
wall, that metalliferous and other veins continue their course
uninterruptedly through both the granite and the slate; that
 the principal veins are generally N. of E. and S. of W., thus
 having the same direction as the layers of granitic rocks or
elvans, and as the strata of the schistose rocks; and also that
 these veins are crossed by others nearly at right angles. I be
lieve that I first pointed out the correspondence between the
directions of veins, and of joints or seams, which intersect both
granite and slate, dividing them into regular concretions; this
suggestion was                   in my paper above alluded            and                 to,
thus concludes: “this view           the   of
                                         subject  explains  why   the dif
ferent series     veins cross each other, and why the veins

France, and is now universally adopted, in the Continental
colleges, in place of the laborious method of Lagrange.
    It is presumed that the small volume which have recently                            I
published upon the theory and solution of equations, as also
Mr. Spiller's elegant translation of Sturm’s memoir *, will
render any detailed account of the theorem itself unnecessary
in this place. My object in the present communication' is
merely to offer a suggestion, for the purpose of facilitating a
little      its
            practical application.
    The    principal   operation which Sturm’s theorem involves,
is   that      finding the greatest common measure between the
                  of
polynomial X, forming the first member            the proposed equa           of
tion, and         derived function XI. The series
                       its                                remainders                        of
or    successive quotients        which we arrive      the course                     in                      of
                                            to at
 this operation, require         have their several signs changed                                             as
 they arise; and they then form, together with the original
polynomials X, XI,         series    functions
                                       a             of
                                        X, X1, X2, Xa,                    ...
from which every requisite information respecting the number
and situation                of
                    the real roots     the equation       of   may                      X    =   0            be
readily evolved.
    Now, instead        taking the trouble
                                  of              actually performing     of
the division            of   X      by

                                          obtain X2, the remainder
                                                in              to
due      that division after having changed signs, we may find
        to
X, much more easily                        by
                              the following rule, viz.
    (A.)   Having    arranged  the terms     X,      that they may beof          so

thus: multiply the third term                                         by by
                                                           of  X
                                               twice the coefficient                                          of
the first term       X1, the next term
                             of               three times that coeffi
cient, the next               by
                       four times, and     on. From these severalso
results subtract those which arise from multiplying the terms
immediately under them                           by

      Z     Mr. Lubbock                  on Bernoulli's         Theory         of the Tides.              457
    The principles upon which the foregoing precepts depend
may be explained in a few words. As the coefficients in XI
are severally obtained by multiplying the corresponding co
efficients in X, each by the exponent in the term to which it
belongs, the derived coefficients are regularly decreasing mul
tiples of the original coefficients, the first in X, being n times
the first in X; the second in Xi, n—1 times the second in X,
and so on. Now in order to effect the division of X by Xi,
we must render the leading coefficients divisible; and for this              by
purpose we multiply            the terms  all                  of   X
                                                         and thus make       n,
the   leading   coefficient           the same in   X
                                                   that     the divisor   as       in
X1;        so
          that the first term                        of
                                        the quotient being simply                                      r,   it
is  obvious that the first remainder will always consist             the                             of
second term        X, twice the third term, three times the fourth
                          of
term, and       on. To render the leading term
                                                                                   we of
                     so                                    this remain
der divisible       that  by    the same divisor XI,

entire remainder                   by
                           the first coefficient      that divisor, and      in
we thus    get     result   which,    from what has just been said,
                                                                                                            of is

  nation are much more minute, and it is more difficult to de
  tect the law which they follow empirically.           The discussions
  which Mr. Dessiou has effected of the London and the Liver
  pool observations have been made with reference to the moon's
  transit preceding the time of high water, which seems to me
  the most convenient course for the object we had immediately
 in view, namely, to obtain tables to serve for the purpose of pre
 dicting the phaenomena.       But it is probable that the tide-wave,
 in as much as it results from the action of the sun and moon,
 maybe considered as developed in the main ocean, and as trans
 mitted through the seas which encompass England, modified
 solely by the wind, and by the resistance of various kinds
 which it encounters in          passage.  onits

  The constant portion of the moon's parallax correction,
which for Liverpool is +7"-9 for par. 54, which I formerly
noticed as inconsistent with Bernoulli's table, is thus pro
bably accounted for; and we see why this quantity should be
rather greater for London, when the argument of the moon's
parallax correction in the time of high water is the moon's
transit immediately preceding the tide, as in those tables which
I  have given. When this last consideration is attended                                                 to,

  Aldborough.
    Although much interested in the organic remains of the crag,
  I have not until very recently had any opportunity of be
  coming acquainted with that part of the formation which is
  now the subject of discussion.      During, however, the latter
 part of this summer, while on a visit at Ipswich, I went over
 to Ramsholt for the purpose of collecting fossils from that
 singularly interesting spot.    Besides a great variety of shells,
 I  found several   species of  coral,  so abundant, that in the
 course of a few hours, I obtained from the stratum itself,
 and the beach below                 it,
                            more specimens than       could carry              I

            Remarks on the Crag of Norfolk and Suffolk.           465
    Mr. Woodward says, p. 353,              “In
                                           the first place, his red
crag is decidedly diluvium or disrupted crag.”          As the anta
gonist to this the following observation occurs in my own
remarks: “The red crag affords decisive evidence of having
been a gradual deposit, formed by successive accumulations of
marine exuviae, which were not brought from a distant part by
the operation of a powerful current, but belonged to the na
tural inhabitants of those localities, which, owing to the subse
quent retreat of the ocean, are now rendered accessible.” p. 90.
        I
      was certainly a little startied at seeing it asserted that the
shelly strata which I have designated by the term red crag,
and which constitute by far the greater part of the crag for
mation, are of diluvial origin.      Mr. Lyell has pointed out the
analogy between these deposits and those which are now
forming round some parts of the British coast.             Professor
Phillips regards the crag as an ancient beach of the German
Ocean. Messrs. Conybeare and W. Phillips, in describing the
crag as a part of the upper marine formation, particularly ad
vert to the fact of certain species of Testacea occurring na
turally grouped together.
    Now, I would not for a moment in<U+017F>er, because Messrs. Lyell,
Conybeare, and other geological inquirers generally regarded
as fully capable of distinguishing between diluvial and regu
larly formed deposits, have considered the crag as belonging
to the latter class, that Mr. Woodward is not in the possession
of certain facts which fully justify him in drawing an opposite
conclusion, but I regret that he should have thought it suffi
cient simply to assert that the red crag is of diluvial origin,
without making public some of the grounds by which he has
arrived at a decision so completely at variance with the facts
brought forward by others.             If
                                    Mr. Woodward had produced
something like a reasonable chain of evidence to support his
assertion, it would have been more in accordance with the
methods usually pursued in determining doubtful points, and
would certainly have done far more towards “eliciting the
truth” than the plan which he has for the present adopted.
    Mr. Woodward evidently uses the term ‘diluvial’ in          most           its
sweeping acceptation,       as
                            I particularly dwelt upon the fact                       of
the coralline stratum being broken up, and            contents min
                                                                its
gled with the newer deposit.
    Mr. Woodward's next objection           is   of
                                              more serious nature.

posit, I dwelt most strongly upon the analogy existing between
the organic remains of that locality and those of Orford and
Aldborough.     This analogy Mr. Woodward virtually denies,
asserting in the most unqualified manner that the term ‘coral
line crag' is not applicable to Ramsholt, as the Aldborough
corallines do not occur there.

468       Mr. Charlesworth's Reply                 to   Mr. Woodward's
   Had the various species of Terebratula and other chalk
fossils, which are of such frequent occurrence in the crag of
Norfolk, been derived from a tertiary instead of a secondary
formation, their extraneous origin would not have been de
tected, and they would have been regarded as among those
shells which are common to different tertiary periods. In de
termining the age of the Norfolk crag according to the prin
ciples laid down by Mr. Lyell, these shells would have swelled
the list of extinct species, and the important fallacy which
must thence have arisen is too obvious to require pointing
out. I shall shortly make public some observations on the
subject of fossils belonging to different periods being occa
sionally associated in the same deposit.     I have strong evi
dence to show, that, in the same way as in Norfolk second
ary fossils have been introduced into the overlying tertiary
beds,-in the same way as in Suffolk I believe the Testacea of
the coralline crag to have been removed into the superincum
bent deposit, so also are the formations now in progress along
some parts of our eastern coast deriving no inconsiderable
proportion of their organic contents from the destruction of
strata which are supposed to represent the organization of the
older pliocene period. If we may look forward to the time
when these deposits shall have become the subject of geologi
cal inquiry, and suppose that their age is to be determined by
comparing such fossil shells as may be obtained from them
with the then existing species, how evidently inaccurate will
be the conclusions formed from such an examination |        By
the time that the deposits now in progress become accessible,
every vestige of the crag will probably have disappeared.
Hence there will be nothing to excite the slightest suspicion
that they contain the organic products of different periods,
any more than there would have been in the instance of the
red crag had the coralline been entirely destroyed “.
   * These observations have no reference to the principles which Mr.
Lyell has advocated in determining the age of tertiary deposits: they apply
exclusively to the errors that may arise in the application of those princi
ples.  The bed of the German Ocean, between Scarborough and Herne

     I should  not have entered upon this subject at present had
not Mr. Lyell, in the new edition of his Principles of Geo
logy, mentioned, that the fact of 150 species being common
to the upper and lower divisions of the crag, was a proof of
their belonging to the same period, without alluding to the
occurrence of the secondary shells in the crag of Norfolk.
Should the red and the coralline crag be ultimately referred
to the same age, it will not in the least affect the         question now
                                                         -

    On again perusing Mr. Woodward's critique on my ex
amination of the tertiary beds in Suffolk, I cannot avoid re
marking that I think it would have been more judicious in
him to have postponed            publication untilits      had acquired                      he                    a
more extensive       acquaintance   with those localities         which                                 to        I
have particularly directed my attention.             From his confess
edly slight acquaintance with the Suffolk crag,                must                                he        be   in
competent          support the assertions
                    to                           has made; and some           he
                           has advanced against my views can only
be of
     the objections                he
      regarded        frivolous and vexatious. Mr. Woodward's
                         as
name has been longer associated with the crag than my own,
and the remarks he has made relative                the statements con             to
tained   in my   paper   are calculated     produce        most unfavour
                                                                     to                      a

such limited data, would consider themselves qualified to dis
pute the accuracy of results obtained from the more exten
sive investigation of others.  I could bring forward consider
able evidence (in addition to that which has already appeared)
for the purpose of showing that the red crag is not of diluvial
origin, and that the Ramsholt deposit is a part of the coral
line stratum. It appears to me, however, that the reliance
Mr. Woodward places on the testimony of others does not ex
tend beyond such facts as fall within the sphere of his own ob
servations also: any additional facts that I might adduce in
support of my previous views, being new to him, might there
fore be regarded as fabrications.

the separation between the lower and upper beds of crag, and

   In the experiments which I performed on this plan, the air
was saturated with moisture by forcing it from a bellows
through a succession of four Woulfe's bottles, connected in the
usual way, so as to cause the air to pass in each bottle through
about two inches of water, and the air thus saturated was
heated by being made to pass through a coil of copper tubing
immersed in a tub of warm water, the thermometer and hy
grometer being placed with their bulbs within a quarter of an
inch of each other in a narrow glass tube attached to the
further extremity of the copper worm. The following are the
 results thus obtained:

              we were justified in considering this latter result as
  anything more than accidental, it might certainly be urged as
  an argument against the strict accuracy either of our experi
  ments or of our theoretical views; for the corrections for the                                         in
  fluence of pressure and aqueous vapour on the specific heat of
  air being neglected in the preceding calculations, the calcu
  lated dew-points instead of being lower should be higher than
  the truth. In order, in fact, to account for the discrepancy in
  question, supposing it to be well established, it would be ne
  cessary to conclude either that m, the coefficient of our hygro
  metric formula, is assumed somewhat too great, or that the
  observed depressions are a little too small.     The first I believe
  to be the true   solution, and I am at   present   disposed to con
  sider m as more   correctly represented   by the fraction ºf than
  ar. This point, however, I have not as yet been able fully
  to satisfy myself upon, nor can the more exact determination
  of the value of the constant be considered a matter of much
  practical importance, since the formula in             present state          its
  conducts,         as

LXII.        On the Cause of      the   ‘Coloured Bands’ observed by                    A.     R.
                            By A CoRResponde Nt.
THofEcoloured  bands described by A. R. in the last number
     this Journal, p. 363, are exactly the same those disco             as
 vered by Sir David Brewster and described in the Edinburgh
 Philosophical Transactions, vol. vii. page 435. Sir John Her—
 schel, in his Treatise on Light, page 475, 476, has given a
 minute account of these bands as “affording an excellent
 illustration of the laws of periodicity observed by the rays
 of light in their progress, whether, as in the Newtonian doc
 trine, we consider them as subjected to alternate fits of easy
 reflection and transmission, or, as in the undulatory hypothesis,
 as passing through a series of phases of alternately direct and
 retrograde motions in the particles of aether in whose vibra
 tions they consist.”
     The bands under consideration are produced entirely by
 the plates of parallel glass between which A. R. had placed
 his convex lens, and are dependent upon the inclination of
 these plates, to the common section of which they are parallel.
 Since the publication of his memoir Sir David Brewster has
 observed the same fringes stretching with singular brilliancy
 across the fourth and sixth images formed by total reflection
 from the posterior surfaces of two plates of common mirror
 glass inclosing water.
     In the work already referred                     to,
                                            Sir John Herschel has
 given   a perspicuous explanation                   of
                                          these phaenomena       their            in
 general details; and         he
                             has adverted also      another series to                          of
 coloured fringes coexisting with the first series, which Sir
David Brewster describes “as far surpassing              precision      in                     of
outline and       in
                   richness     colouring
                                   of       every analogous  phaeno
 menon which he had seen.”
     “By intercepting,” says Sir John, “the principal trans
mitted beams         the direct image, and receiving only those
                       in
portions      the rays going

AT         the last meeting of the British Association for the Ad
         vancement of Science, Mr. H. Hudson and Mr. Powell
furnished several communications on radiant caloric t. After
having cited some of my experiments on calorific transmis
sion, these ingenious philosophers endeavoured to explain
them by hypotheses which in my opinion can no longer be
sustained in the present state of science.                     I wish to direct
inquiry to a subject which by                          its

thermal substance employed will then be applied against the
central opening of the metallic screen: it will immediately
transmit a certain quantity of radiant heat, which will pe
netrate into the cylindrical covering of the pile placed at
a distance behind the screen, and directed upon the prolon
gation of the line drawn from the source to the centre of the
opening: the indicating needle of the galvanometer con
nected with the thermoelectric pile will be set in motion, and
will take a greater or a less deviation according to the dia
thermaneity (diathermaneité) of the substance of which the
plate consists.  After having noted this arc of deviation, let
the pile be removed by degrees from the direction of the im
mediately transmitted calorific rays, taking care always to hold

studying the immediate transmission of radiant caloric through
solid bodies; and yet that philosopher cites his results as facts
tending to prove            there is no immediate passage of simple
heat through that class of bodies. His induction, although
presented under a doubtful form, does not appear to me per
missible.
     Mr. Powell performed in 1825 a very beautiful experiment
upon radiant caloric *; it consists in proving that the ratio of
calorific absorption of a white surface to that of a black one
is not the same for the rays proceeding directly from the
source, and for the rays transmitted by a plate of glass. The
sources of heat employed by Mr. Powell were an Argand
lamp and iron heated to a bright red.                                I
                                                      have had occasion
more recently to verify this fact, which holds good not only
with the glass, but with                   all
                                    diathermal substances, rock-salt
excepted.          In          explain this phaenomenon,                                         as             as

those of the heat emitted by the boiling water are completely

have other transmissions if we took calorific sources of                                                                     dif

several kinds also of calorific rays in the heat which ordi

         On the Geological Map                        of Ireland.             By R. J. GRIFFITH.
                             presented his Geological                         Map of Ireland, the result
      of many years' research and labour, assisted in part by the publi
cations of Weaver, Conybeare, Buckland, and Berger. Mr. Griffith, in
pointing out the inaccuracies of existing maps of Ireland, dwelt on
the advantages which will be derived from the publication of the                                           Ord
nance maps of Ireland, four counties of which have now appeared.
At present great difficulties attend the allocation of geological phae
nomena, which are frequently misplaced in relation to each other,
from the necessity of following the defects of the old maps.                                          Mr.Grif
fith, as an example, stated that in Arrowsmith's map, Benwee Head
is placed twenty miles north of the parallel of Sligo, though it
is actually due west of that town. The remarkable position of
the mountain masses was first pointed out. They occur on the
margin of the island, and inclose the great central limestone plain;
an arrangement which shortens the courses of the rivers, rising as
they do in the higher grounds, and rapidly descending to the sea.
The Shannon is an exception, having a course of 140 miles; but it
also is affected by the peculiarity alluded        stream falling eighty
                                                                             to,   its
feet    the first twenty miles
        in                                                 its
                                      course, and only eighty feet more
                                                   of
   the remaining 120. On the great plain which occupies the centre
of in
    the island numerous beds        gravel occur, called Escars, which
                                                      of
though constant        direction when considered
                            in                         reference    small                in           to
spaces, are variable when the comparison extends over greater
limits. Mr. Griffith considers the great bogs         due     these accu                as      to
mulations         of
                gravel, which,     damming            by
                                                the water, facilitate the    in
growth      Sphagnum palustre. Under the bogs are deep deposits
             of                                                                                                of
marl, underlaid            by
                       clay and gravel, which further support the idea
of ancient lakes. The marl was stated             one instance forty feet

   mentary rocks, commenced his illustrations by those of a more
    crystalline character, such as gneiss, mica slate, &c.; and stated
    that he considered the great groups of Ireland as corresponding to
   those of Scotland, particularly the Northern to the Grampians, and
    the Mourne to the Dumfriesshire mountains.                    The general direc

   tion     of

        V.P.G.S.
    Mr. Murchison described           a great group of fossiliferous deposits
which         rises out from beneath the old red sandstone.  To these rocks,
which         he has termed in descending order the Ludlow, Wenlock,                                    Ca
radoc,  and Llandeilo formations, (each distinguished by peculiar or
ganic   remains, and frequently by subordinate limestones,) it was
found essential to assign a comprehensive term, since they consti
tute one natural system interpolated between the old red sandstone
and the slaty rocks of Wales.       He observed that it was well known
to      all
        practical geologists, that        consequence  in    the recent ad           of
vances      the science,

    rocks which had    engaged   his attention during the last five years,
Mr. Murchison    recently  suggested   (See Lond. and Edinb. Phil. Mag.,
July 1835, pres. vol. 48.) that the group should

passages from the lowest member of the “Silurian system” into the
underlying slaty rocks, now named by Professor Sedgwick the
“ Upper Cambrian.”
  This communication was illustrated by Ordnance Maps extending
over large parts of eleven counties, coloured in the field by Mr.
Murchison.
    Professor Sedgwick commenced by pointing out the imperfection
of    the sections exhibited in the North of England, and some por
tions of North Wales, in consequence of the entire want of conti
nuity between the carboniferous series and the inferior schistose
groups. Some of the latter are fossiliferous both in Denbigh
shire and Westmorland; but in the interrupted sections of those
counties it is impossible to tell how many terms are wanting to com
plete the series to the old red sandstone and carboniferous lime
stone.     In the country described by Mr. Murchison these difficulties
do not    exist,   and his sections have filled up a wide chasm in the
succession of British deposits.            Professor Sedgwick then described
in   descending      order the     groups    of slate rocks, as they are seen in
Wales and Cumberland. To the                 highest  he gave the name of Upper
 Cambrian      group.      It occupies    the  greatest  part of the chain of the
Berwyns, where it is connected with the Llandeilo flags of the Silu
rian system, and is thence expanded through a considerable portion
of South Wales. In one part of             its
                                             course       based

stone and calcareous slate; but on the whole,                  contains much less
                                                                     it

group       it
             gave the name        of  Middle Cambrian.            composesIt      the          all

 abounds      in fine roofing-slate, alternating with, and apparently pass

those  of  a mere    local character, such as volcanic eruptions.    The
local phaenomena may indeed have been similar to those of the        pre
sent time, but the elevations of mountain chains are evidences of a
more general class of phaenomena, which have affected organic life,
constituting thereby the various zoological epochs which may be
traced in the earth's strata.     It was in such periods of violence and
change that the beds of any one system were deposited, the animals
coexisting at the time being, according to the more or less suscep
tible nature of their organization, more or less completely annihi.
lated; and it was in the tranquillity which followed, that new beings
were formed, and lived to tenant in like manner the strata of another
system,   which should result from another epoch of disturbance.
M. Agassiz produced,      as an example of sudden destruction, a draw
ing of fossil fishes crowded together in a very confused manner,
such as could only have arisen from an instantaneous catastrophe,
arresting them, as it were, in a moment.
   M. Agassiz then, at the request of Professor Sedgwick, explained
those characters, such as the position of the fins, the arrangement
and size of the scales, &c., by which the fishes of different geological
eras may be distinguished, referring especially to those of the old

  Notice of a newly discovered Tertiary Deposit on the Coast         of
              Yorkshire.    By John Phillips, F.R.S., &c.
   Two hundred yards north of the harbour of Bridlington, near the
situation where Professor Sedgwick and the author and other ob
servers had suspected and looked for tertiary beds, a wasting of the
low cliff had disclosed to a small extent layers of greensand and
clay, both, but especially the former, containing shells, &c. Diluvial
clay and pebbles cover and partially confuse this deposit. Of 55
species of fossils from these beds, which are in Mr. Bean's cabinet
at Scarborough, a very small number (four) belongs to the crag, a
very small number (five or six) to recent species, and the greater
proportion is extinct. On comparison of the facts known concern
ing this deposit, the crag, the Touraine beds, and certain other fo
reign tertiaries, Professor Phillips founded an argument concerning
the limits of error in the application of Mr. Lyell's test of the age
of tertiary formations by the numerical relations of the species of
fossils which they contain to recent forms.        It appeared to Pro
fessor Phillips that these limits were wide, and that a method of
such power and value must not be applied without great caution.

        The trees in question were discovered at Balgray Quarry, imme
     diately adjoining the aqueduct over the Kelvin, about three miles to
     the north of the city of Glasgow.
        The quarry abounds in the usual coal plants, laid horizontally:
     in one part of it a number of trees were found standing in an up
     right position, throwing their roots out in     directions,      ap            all                     to    all

       half-tide level, because the mariner would have to make variable
       allowances to ascertain the least water he was to expect in the
       channel before him, yet he would suggest for scientific and frequent
       practical references the desirability of engraving on some rock
       spot of every harbour, and sheltered portions of coast, the well-de
       fined half-tide level, D'Ated; for, on the assumption that such a
       level is (no matter what the whole amount of rise and fall differs),
       in the same latitude, equidistant from the earth's centre, then we
        have a standard of obvious importance to science. By reference to
        this constant level those discrepancies may be adjusted which attend
       engineering operations, designed to cooperate on opposite sides of an
       isthmus, where the vertical range differs, and either high or low
       water level separately be started from, instead of the mean centre
        of   each range, i.e. half-tide level.
          The Rev. W.M. WHEwell made the following remarks for the
        purpose of exemplifying the application of physical science to geo
        logical researches.
           1. The permanence of the level of                                  mean      water, which Capt.
        Denham has recently proved by trial at Liverpool, suggests the
        proper mode of making such observations on the permanence of
        the relative level of land and sea, as were formerly recommended
        by the Association.    In tidal seas the level of the ocean must,
        for such a purpose, be estimated with reference, not to the height
        of high or of low water, which is variable on many accounts, but
        to the height of mean water. This mean water is to be obtained
        by taking at least two high waters and the intervening low water,
        or two low waters and the intervening high water. A very few tides
        will give a near approximation to the true mean level; but the
         more there are taken, the more accuracy will be obtained. This
1.".     mean level must, of course, for the purposes now spoken        re                               of,   be
                                          the solid ground.    The phaeno

On the Principles of Classification in the Animal Kingdom in ge
  neral, and among the Mammalia in particular. By Professor
   AGAssiz.
   Although   the principal groups of animals are impressed with
such characters as to be easily recognised and to admit of little
doubt, yet their order and succession have been determined by no
general principle. This appears from the discrepancy in the posi
tion assigned to them by the most eminent systematists, each of
whom has assumed arbitrarily some organ or system of organs for
the basis of his arrangement. Professor Agassiz, after adverting to
some German naturalists who alone have sought after a general
principle which should be satisfactory to “philosophic natural
ists," passed in review the classes of the animal kingdom, each
of which, he stated, exhibited in an eminent degree the develop
ment of some one of the animal functions. While Vertebrate ani
mals (with Man their type) arrive at the greatest perfection in
the organs of the Senses, the Invertebrate offer in the class of
Worms the representative of the system of Nutrition, in Crustacea
of Circulation, in Insects of Respiration, and in Mollusca of Genera
tion. The Professor next proceeded to demonstrate in what man
ner each subclass of vertebrate animals derives           peculiar characits
ter from some one element                 of
                                  the animal  oeconomy.
   This predominant element         the bony skeleton
                                           is              Fishes, the musin
cular structure      Reptiles, the sensibility

                                 the senses     Mammalia, which there

fore reproduced the distinguishing character and constitute the type
of vertebrate animals.     He next showed that each of the other sub
classes   ofthe higher group         represented among the Mammalia

along with      its
                 own peculiar type.     He explained his reason for the
fourfold division which              he
                              had adopted       the subclass, pointing out
                                                        in

Observations      on the Zoology            of the Island of Rathlin, off the North
  ern Coast        of Ireland.              By JAMEs DRUMMOND MARshALL,
  M.D.
   The zoology of Rathlin does not offer any new species in addition
to those hitherto found on the opposite coast of the county Antrim,
and this notice was laid before the Association rather to mark the
habitats of some species than to add anything to what is already
known.
    The only Mammalia frequenting the island are, the Norway Rat,
the Common Mouse, the Shrew Mouse, and the Hare. The latter
is but rarely seen, and not being able to procure a specimen, the au
thor cannot say whether it is the hare of Great Britain or that
lately ascertained to be a species, or rather perhaps a variety, pecu
liar to Ireland.
    In Ornithology, so far as the author could ascertain, there are about
60 species, comprising 32 land and 28 water birds. From the situation
of the island,      precipitous cliffs, and the consequent facilities for
                     its
incubation, many species               of
                                  water birds choose       for summer re it      a
sidence.     The most common species are the Larus Rissa, Larus
argentatus, Larus Canus, Alca Torda, Fratercula arctica, Uria
 Troile, Uria Grylle, Phalacrocoraa Carbo, Phalacrocorax cristatus.
    Although      all
                  the above-mentioned        species are plentifully distri
buted, the Larus Rissa,         Kittiwake,

Colonel Sykes's own cabinet, others are mentioned of such close ana
logy as to render their specific difference extremely dubious. Many
species of birds of different natural groups and habits are thus proved
to have an extensive geographical range, under considerable differ
ences of mean temperature.         Deducting those species, which do
or   may  be  imagined    to migrate  from one region to another, there
remains abundant evidence, derived from continually resident birds,
that some birds live in India with a mean temp. of 77° to 82°, and
in Britain with a mean temp. of 45° to 50°. Connecting these facts
with the instances of tigers living near the limits of perpetual snow,
and elephants and Indian birds braving our winters, Colonel Sykes
 concludes that the power of acclimation possessed by many birds
 and other animals is very considerable, and capable of useful appli
 cation to a question of practical importance, viz. the necessity of
 employing artificial heat generally in our vivariums, and to the cu
 rious geological problem of the climate of the globe when elephants
 and tigers were inhabitants of the northern zones.
    [Captain JAMEs Ross, in corroboration of these views, stated that
 the Stonechat, Whitethroat, and Golden Plover were inhabitants of
 Hudson's Bay, and that the Raven also occurs in the Arctic Circle,
 without being subject to change of plumage.]

On a Mode    of preserving Echinodermata.                      By    the Rev.   Charles
                                      MAYNE.
  In the year 1828, being at the sea-side, Mr. Mayne collected many
Echini for examination; and the house not being large enough to
afford him a separate room, he used chloride of lime to prevent in
convenience to the family from the smell.    He soon perceived that
the Echini steeped in the solution did not lose their spines; he ac
cordingly tried to preserve them with                 all
                                          their spines on, and suc
ceeded completely.     He has since tried this process with many
Echini and small star-fish. The preparation should not        strong        be

that the spines would fall off.

      On    the Action          of Light          on Plants.                By Professor DAUBENy.
    Professor Daubeny reported the progress which he has made in
his experiments on this subject since 1833, when he communicated
the results obtained up to that time to the British Association at
Cambridge. At that period he had ascertained that the quantity of
carbonic acid decomposed by a plant was in proportion, not to the
chemical or heating influence of the ray transmitted to                       its                   it,

upon the same law; with this difference, however, that, provided
some light           be
                 present,     body radiating much heat will serve                                                   as

to that kind of wood; or whether it was a general feature in the ho
rizontal branches of other Coniferae.
    The first step in the investigation was to procure another branch
of Taarodium disticha. This he did last summer, and marked the
upper side before the branch was cut off. The structure of this
branch agreed in every respect with that of the branch formerly ex
amined, and the pale-coloured or narrowest side was the uppermost.
 The next step was to ascertain whether the stem of Taxodium di
sticha agreed in structure with the branches. For this purpose the
author requested Mr. James Macnab, of the botanic garden of Edin
burgh, to bring him from America a portion of a stem. This he
 was so kind as to do last winter. The stem was five inches and
 three tenths thick in the longest diameter.    The pith was nearer one
 side than the other by three quarters of an inch. The surface of
 the cross section was of a uniform pale colour, with the exception
 of a spot surrounding the pith nearly an inch in diameter, of a
 slightly darker shade. On examining a number of sections of this
 stem, they were       found      all                to
                                agree with coniferous stems    general,                            in

    Having thus ascertained that             Taarodium disticha the differ

    But although the upper and under sides of many, perhaps all, co
niferous branches, present a different structure, yet such a difference
is not entirely confined to the branches. In some few stems a similar
difference has been seen in the opposite sides.    In a stem of Pinus
 Cedrus, for instance, one of the sides was of a pale colour, and had
the usual structure; the other side was of a darker colour, and had
   structure similar to that of the under side of horizontal branches.
 Another portion of the same kind of wood, however, was of a uni
form colour, and had throughout the usual structure. A young
 stem of Pinus laricia had a structure similar to that of branches,
and the same was observed                         in an upright stem of Cupressus semper
tº trens.

   Dr. West exhibited a specimen of Bog Yew, in which, from the
non-adherence of two successive annual layers, the central portion
of the heartwood, though in close contact with the surround
ing portion, which constituted the greatest part of the bulk of the
tree, was throughout                     its

       ties are most   probably  exaggerated;   and both the flowers and the
       seed are employed in this country in the cure of various nervous af
       fections, and especially epilepsy.  Yolorochitl is an Aztec term im
       plying the Flower of the Heart (Flor del Corazon).
         I  shall conclude these remarks by observing, that several of the
       matters indicated, together with a multitude of others relating to the
       vegetable kingdom of Mexico, have been discussed in a German bo

          Mr. HAMILtoN stated that he has lately received a pericarp and
       two nuts of the celebrated Palo de Vaca, from the vicinity of the
       farm of Barbula, spoken of by Humboldt; but, unfortunately, they
       did not reach him in a state             fit
                                       for vegetation, and were apparently
       too old when gathered. He has written for          further supply   a                          of

    The circulation of the fluids in living animals, though mainly car
ried on by the influence of the vital powers, is nevertheless to a cer
tain extent amenable to the general laws of hydraulics. Gravity,
motion of the particles of the solids upon each other, the respiratory
function, pressure on the surface of the body, all, under various
modifications, promote or retard the movement of the fluids along
their vessels. But of                 all

these animals while under water, there is another cause operating,
when at great depths in the ocean, to the prejudice of their circu
lating fluids, such as is never experienced by terrestrial animals,
namely, pressure on the surface of their bodies by the water, increas
ing with the depth from the surface. A boat, as observed by Scoresby,
when dragged to the bottom of the sea by a whale, into which a har
poon was struck, became in a few minutes as completely soaked in
every pore as if it had lain at the bottom of the sea since the flood:
after being raised again to the surface, by the whale returning “to
blow", it could with difficulty be got into the ship on account of
its  great weight; and           fragment a                   of       it,

 that, when they are filled with injection, the parts beneath cease to
 be visible; the vessels are as thick as the finger, and coiled, and
 heaped up on one another to an almost incredible amount.         The
 contrast between the condition of the venous system in the great
 northern diver and that in the gannet, as exhibited by Dr. Houston,
 is important in establishing the uses  of these reservoirs.
   The diver and gannet are both seafaring birds, but differ remark
 ably in their modes of seizing the fish on which they feed. The diver

it had existed: he expressed his full concurrence with the opinions
advanced by   Mr. Owen, in the Transactions of the Zoological Society
of London", as  to the animal or vital character of the bodies to which
the appearance is owing.       He next remarked some interesting
coincidences in the cases he had examined: thus, in one instance,
where the muscles were very generally affected, he found a large
cyst in the liver which contained several hydatids. These were
exhibited to the meeting.   In                         all
                                     the other cases there were marks

remote period: thus,    three cases the lungs were                  tu                                                of

osseous nuclei were distinct in the cartilaginous basis.   The author
next adverted to the peculiar fleshy character of the left ventricle in
the ox, a transverse section exhibiting the appearance of a puncture
or stab, rather than of a distinct chamber; this formed a curious
contrast to the heart of the horse.   From these and many other ob
servations, Mr. Harrison inferred that these bones are supports, not
only to this mass of muscle, but also to the root of the aorta which
is connected to them, and which is thus maintained in a permanently
open state ; while, again, there being two bones connected by liga
ment, the elasticity of the vessel is not impaired.          These bones,
moreover, serve to support the septum of the auricles, and to prevent
their perfect closure or collapse, and they also floor and support two
of the aortic sinuses with their semilunar valves. The Professor
next spoke of the peculiar, hard, marble-like fat which is deposited
in masses about the roots of the great arteries, and showed that these
cover the three sinuses of the pulmonary artery, and that sinus of the
aorta which is deprived of osseous support. These arterial sinuses
are lodged in excavations in the fatty deposits alluded            and                                    to,            no
ordinary force can overcome the resistance which they offer            over                                     to
distension; and thus the sinuses are enabled        support the returning      to
columns     ofblood, which are impelled        the elasticity        by
                                                                 resiliency                          or
of the arteries, which   such animals are peculiarly strong and elastic.

Arantii; contrasted the structure        the pulmonary artery and

 510      British Association for the Advancement of Science.
    Dr. Corrigan has in some experiments substituted a gum-elastic
 tube for the portion of gut.
      Dr. Alison read a notice of a few experiments and observations
   which he had made, with the assistance of different friends, on two
   distinct subjects: 1. On the Condition and the vital Powers in       Ar
   teries leading to inflamed parts, (in continuation of those on the same
   subject read to the Section in 1834); and 2. On the immediate Cause
   of Death in Asphyxia.
      He connected them with one another by some preliminary obser
   vations on the importance of establishing the truth, and, as far as
  posssible, determining the applications of the principle to which the
  term spontaneity of movement in the fluids of living bodies has been
  applied, i.e. of movements of the fluids in living bodies, which are
  dependent on their living state, but independent of any contraction
  of their living solids.
      In proof of the truth of this principle he stated that many facts
  might be adduced; and the immediate object of the statements now
  made was to prove that without reference to this principle it is im
  possible to explain two sets of phaenomena, which have been care
  fully observed, and are of essential importance,—the changes in the
  motion of the blood which attend inflammation, and those which result
  from the application of oxygen to the blood in respiration.
      On the first point, he detailed the result of two examinations (in
  addition to those formerly reported) of the arteries of limbs of
 horses killed on account of injury and inflammation of single joints,
 in one case of three weeks', in the other of eight days' standing, The
 power of contracting on a distending force, and expelling their con
 tents, was tried in the arteries both of the inflamed and the sound
 limbs, by the same contrivance as was used by Porseuille to compare
 the contractile power of living and dead arteries; i.e. by using bent
 tubes and stopcocks in such a way as to distend a given portion of
 artery (first of the one limb and then of the other,) by water pressed
 into it by a firm weight of mercury, and then allowing the artery to
 expel the distending water, and getting a measure of the force which
 it exerts in doing so, by the rise of the level of water in a tube com
 municating with the artery. The result was in both cases in ac
 cordance with the observations formerly made, that the artery of the
 inflamed limb exerted less power of contracting on, and expelling          its
 contents, than that of the sound limb.        The difference was as   10 to
 16  in  one  case,   as
                    and     125      to
                                    175    the
                                          in    other,  which was the more
satisfactory  of    the two,    asthe experiment was made more imme
ately after death.
  It    appeared also,  on    careful comparative examination, that the
                                                          of of
contraction   of   the emptied   arteries  atthe moment        death (which
                             in by
is  the measure adopted         Parry     the vital power
                                          of                   arteries) was
less in   the diseased than      the sound limbs; the difference between
the contracted state immediately after death, and the subsequently
dilated and dead state     of the artery (28 hours after death), being #th
in   the caseof   the diseased limb, and 3rd    in   of
                                                   that    the sound limb.

 the alternate expansion and contraction      the lungs by the respi               of

    That this    not the fact might
                             is          concluded from the fatal as     be
 phyxia produced      breathing azote by   other gases, not poisonous,       or

but not containing oxygen; in which     case it had been observed by
Broughton and others, that the stagnation of blood in the lungs, and
the distention of the right side of the heart, take place equally as
when the respiratory movements are suspended.        But to this obser
vation it might be objected, that the animals on which experiment had
been made had been allowed to remain in the azote until they became
insensible, and their respiration of course ceased, and had not been
examined until some minutes after their apparent death, and it might
be said, that the right side of the heart had become congested only
after the acts of respiration had ceased, and in consequence of their
 cessation.
   In order to avoid this source of fallacy several rabbits were con
fined in azote, only until their breathing became laboured, the                  re
spirations generally less frequent, but much longer and fuller
than natural. They were then taken out and instantly struck on
the head with such force as to crush the brain and cerebellum, and
 arrest the circulation as instantaneously as possible. This was always
 attended with violent and general convulsion, but with no attempt
 at respiration, sensation being apparently instantaneously suppressed.
 When the body was opened immediately after the convulsion had
 subsided, the right side of the heart was always found distended
 with blood, and palpitating feebly; the left side at rest and compa
 ratively empty: the quantity of blood obtained by puncturing and
 pressing the right side and pulmonary artery was from 5 to 10 times
 as much as could be obtained from the left side and aorta.              When
 a rabbit   previously    breathing  naturally   was killed in the same man
 ner, the quantity of blood on the right side of the heart (apparently
 accumulating there during the convulsions) was found to be greater
 than on the left; but the difference was decidedly less than when
 it had been breathing azote; and in one of these comparative trials
 the blood in the left side was found to be sufficient to keep up a
 feeble palpitation in that side, whereas in the animals that had
 breathed azote the left side was always found quite at rest.
    It appears from these experiments that when oxygen is not ad
 mitted into the lungs in inspiration, even although the respiratory
 movements continued further and more forcible than usual up to the
 moment of death, the blood stagnates on the right side of the heart;
 and that the application of oxygen to the blood at the lungs is a
 cause of acceleration of          movement through the lungs, indepen

sels in the lungs to be sedative or relaxing, and ascribe to a dimi
mished action of these vessels the apparently increased efficiency of
the right side of the heart when oxygen is applied, we suppose the
oxygen to produce the very opposite effect to that which has always
been observed when it or any other stimulus has taken effect on any
individual artery.
    The only mode in which it appears possible to escape from these
difficulties is to suppose that the stimulus given by the oxygen to
the flowing blood through the lungs, is a stimulus to that movement
which is independent of any contraction of the solids containing
the blood. This conclusion is in perfect accordance with the ob
servations of Haller on the derivation of blood, perceptible under
the microscope, towards any part where an opening is made in a
vessel, and air admitted into contact with the blood,
                                                           because he
gives satisfactory reasons for thinking that this derivation is not
owing to contraction of the vessels; it is also in accordance
                                                                  with
 observations on some of the lowest tribes of animals, and on vege
 tables, where currents in fluids are observed in connexion

 act of respiration, but no movement of solids has been detected; and
 even, as Dr. Alison thinks, with the observations of Purkinje
                                                                   and

 much higher in the scale, because although these last currents have
 been ascribed by most authors to vibrations of ciliae, which are seen
  to accompany them in various instances, it seems very doubtful
 whether they can be adequately explained without supposing a
  “jeu d'attraction et repulsion” to be commenced in these instances,
  as well as in the respiration of the lowest tribes.

                         was first read, entitled “Note on the Trappean
 Rocks associated with the (New) Red Sandstone of Devonshire;” by
 Henry T. De la Beche, For. Sec. G.S.
    The author remarks, that while trappean rocks are not found among
 the (new) red sandstone series of Somersetshire and the more north
 ern portions of Devonshire, the southern portions of the latter county
 afford many examples of the association of trappean rocks with the
 lower parts of this series, particularly near Tiverton, Thorverton, Sil
 verton, Kellerton Park, Crediton, and Exeter.
     When hastily viewed, the trappean rocks might be mistaken for
 masses of igneous matter which have been intruded, in a state of fu
 sion, among the beds of red sandstone.      A more detailed examination
 of the various facts connected with their mode of occurrence leads,
 however, in the opinion of the author, to the inference that they
                                                                       have
 been produced by volcanic action during the formation of the lower
 parts of the (new) red sandstone series; in fact, that the trappean
                                                                      rocks

series of Devonshire".
   The author endeavours, in the first place, to point out the relative
geological age of the red sandstones and conglomerates with which
these trappean rocks are associated in Southern Devon, by showing,
that in their continuation to the northward, along the skirts of the
grauwacke to the shores of the Bristol Channel, they pass into a series
of beds which is crowned by magnesian limestone and conglomerate,
equivalent to the magnesian limestone and conglomerate of the Men
dip Hills and the vicinity of Bristol. The beds beneath the magnesian
conglomerate, which very rarely passes into a magnesian limestone,
from the absence of pebbles derived from older rocks, consist, for the
most part, of red or claret-coloured sandstones, with an occasional
seam or bed of conglomerate, the cementing matter of which is not

 Sedgwick, F.G.S., Woodwardian Professor in the University of
  Cambridge, and Williamson Peile, Esq., F.G.S., of Whitehaven. An

     A paper was afterwards read, “On the occurrence near Shrews
 bury of Marine Shells of existing species in transported Gravel and
 Sand, resting upon a peat bog which contains imbedded Trees;” by
 Joshua Trimmer, Esq., F.G.S.
     In November of last year Mr. Trimmer noticed, that in widening
 the road about five miles from Shrewsbury, towards Shiffnal, some
 very black timber was extracted from beneath a bed of loam and
 gravel; and having subsequently examined the spot, he has commu
 nicated his observations in this paper.
     Two sections have been cut, to the depth of 15 feet, and are distant
 from each other about 600 yards. The eastern excavation is 360
 yards long, and consists, proceeding from east to west, of 200 yards
 of sandy loam and gravel; 40 yards of sand resembling sea-sand, the
 laminae crossing each other in various directions; 60 yards of reddish
loam, with curved laminae near              junction with the sand, and hori
                                                       its
 zontal      at the lower   part,  the  upper  portion not being laminated;
 and    lastly,     60
                     yards     sandy loam and gravel.
                                  of                        Fragments        shells          of

                                 of        but are most abundant        the veins      in
 of  fine gravel which pervade the sand: among them the author found
 Turritella terebra, Cardium edule, and Tellina solidula.
     The western excavation contained fewer shells, and presented near
the eastern termination            the southern side: cultivated soil,
                                       of                                    foot;           1

resting        on peat.   On the southern side this excavation consisted
of   fine cultivated soil,             feet; sandy loam, with occasionally
                                           to

   2ndly, The surface was covered with a forest of birch, oak, and fir.
   3rdly, The forest was destroyed, or it decayed, and a peat bog was
formed.
   4thly, A rush of sea buried the bog beneath a mass of loam and
gravel, containing fragments of existing marine shells and granite
boulders.
    In conclusion, the author draws attention to the natural sections
on both sides of the Severn, west of Shrewsbury, about one mile above
the Welsh Bridge, in one of which he obtained, after much search, a
few fragments of shells; and he begs geologists in general, both in
England and Ireland, to institute a patient examination of the super
ficial gravel of their neighbourhood for fragments of shells, however,
comminuted.

considers to be new.

 families of the Ganoidian order of M. Agassiz*. Some of the scales
correspond precisely with those of the Megalichthys, described by
Dr. Hibbert, from Burdiehouse near Edinburgh: but the plants asso
ciated with the ichthyolites, the author states on the authority of Pro
fessor Lindley, are entirely dissimilar from those found at Burdie
house. Further particulars are given in the “Proceedings”.
    A paper was next read, “On the Bones of Birds from the Strata
of Tilgate Forest in Sussex;” by Gideon Mantell, Esq., F.G.S.
    Mr. Mantell states that soon after his attention was first directed
to the fossils of the Wealden, he discovered in the strata of Tilgate
 Forest several slender bones, which, from their close resemblance to
 the tarso-metatarsal bones of certain Grallae or Waders, he was induced
to refer to birds. The correctness of this opinion was afterwards
 doubted, in consequence of the thin fragile bones found at Stones
field, and considered as belonging to birds, being ascertained to be
those of Pterodactyles.    Having subsequently discovered a few spe
cimens of more decided character, Mr. Mantell submitted them to
the inspection of Baron Cuvier, during his last visit to England, who
pronounced them to belong to a Wader, probably to a species of
Ardea. Still it was doubted whether these remains did really be
long to those of birds; but the author's attention having recently
been directed to the subject, he placed his specimens in the hands of
Mr. Owen, of the College of Surgeons. This gentleman, after a care
ful examination, pointed out that one bone decidedly belonged to a
Wader, being undoubtedly the distal extremity of a left tarso-meta
tarsal bone, presenting the articular surface or place of attachment
of the posterior or opposable toe. Other specimens of long bones
Mr. Owen conceives may have belonged to a more erpetoid form of
bird than is now known. From this examination, Mr. Mantell's pre
vious views of the existence of birds below the chalk have been fully
established, and, as the author observes, these are the oldest remains
of the class at present known. The memoir concludes with a descrip
tion of the bones, consisting of a tarso-metatarsal of a Wader, a
tibia (?), a metatarsal bone, a humerus, and an ulna.
    The next paper read was entitled, “Remarks on the Coffin-bone
 (distal phalangeal) of a Horse, from the Shingle Bed of the Newer
Pliocene Strata of the Cliffs near Brighton;” by Gideon Mantell,
Esq., F.G.S., &c., a notice of whica is given in the “Proceedings”.
    An extract was lastly read, of a letter from Dr. Daubeny, in which
he gives the analysis of the mineral spring lately discovered near Ox
ford, and announced to the Society by Dr. Buckland, at the Meeting
held on the 29th of April, stating that the water at the time the ana
lysis was made (March 26th) contained more sulphuric salts than
any other spring in this country; a pint containing 132-87 grains of
solid contents, entirely saline, of which 52:40 are sulphate of soda.
    This being the last Meeting of the Session, the Society adjourned,

   The oxacids, by their action in pyroxylic spirit, give rise to two
sorts   of products: true neutral salts, corresponding to compound
aethers formed from alcohol; and true acid salts, corresponding to
sulphovinic or phosphovinic acid. The former are very easily ob
