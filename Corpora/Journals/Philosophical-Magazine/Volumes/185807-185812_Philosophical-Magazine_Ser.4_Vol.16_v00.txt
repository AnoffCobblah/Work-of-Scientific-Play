with no limitation as to the physical laws.          Accordingly the
investigation is then undertaken on the suppositions, that the
resistance varies as the square of the velocity, that the co
efficient for longitudinal motion may be different from that for
lateral motion, and that the speed of delivery of the cable may
be different from the ship's speed. Commencing with the equa
tions in their most general form, it is shown that the straight
 line is one of the forms of solution; and the tension of the
 cable is investigated on different suppositions, as to the propor
 tion of the coefficients, and as to the rate of the ship and that
 of cable-delivery.     I trust that this investigation will be found
 to  possess real  practical  value.   This is the third part of the
paper.
   I   shall now proceed with the investigations.
   1. It is assumed that the bottom of the sea is level, that the
ship moves with uniform velocity and delivers out the cable
with uniform velocity, and that the form of the curve taken by
the cable from the point of leaving the ship to the point of
touching the ground is always the same. The movement of
any individual point of the cable may therefore be conceived as
compounded of two motions, namely, a sliding down of the
point along the curve, while that curve travels horizontally after
the ship.
   2. The following is the notation which will be employed:—
   n the ship’s velocity.
   m the velocity of delivery of the cable (when
                                            -

the ship's velocity).
   a the horizontal ordinate of any point of the cable; measured
from the place where the cable touches the ground, in the direc
tion of the ship's motion.
   a' the horizontal ordinate of the same point measured from a
fixed origin.   a' therefore=w--nt-H K.
   9 the vertical ordinate of the same point, measured upwards
 from the bottom.
    s the length of the curve from the place where the cable
 touches the bottom to the same point.
    s' the length of the cable from a fixed origin to the same
  point. S' therefore=s+nt + L          (if
                                    the cable             be
                                                  delivered with

the same equation which gives the tension in the common cate
nary.    Hence we obtain this singular result: that the form of
the travelling curve is exactly the same as the common catenary;
and that the tension at every point is exactly the same as at the
corresponding point of a similar fixed catenary, increased only
by an absolute constant a, which depends only on the velocity
with which the curve travels.      In the instance of the Atlantic
cable, this constant a is insignificantly small in comparison with
the other tensions.

   It will be seen that a small change in the stray length makes
a great change in the tension.
   18. It is important to examine into the form and tension of
the curve in one case (of which the results are included, for con
venience, in the last line of last Table), namely, the case when c,
the only constant, receives the special value 0.         It will be
remembered that c is sensibly the tension of the cable at the
point where it touches the ground. This tension cannot, in the
nature of things, be negative; for every case where it is positive,
the formulae already detailed are sufficiently complete; but when
the tension at the bottom =0, these formulae are without mean
ing, and a new investigation must be made.
   19. Taking up the investigation where c is first introduced in

Again, the index of the second exponential term is positive;
and therefore if at any other point of the curve w-ey have a

Consequently, w—ey must always=0. This equation, it will be

which       I
         am surprised did not more readily present itself: it is
simply to make an interruption in the secondary circuit, besides
that formed by the vacuum ; such second interruption to be in
air, and of the extreme length of the spark, so that not more
than one spark should pass at a time across the intervening air,
and consequently not more than one discharge through the
vacuous space.
   Using the air-pump with phosphorus and a stick of potash in
the receiver, I connected by a wire one of the secondary ter
minals of a Ruhmkorff coil with the rod which entered the
receiver at the top. The wire from the second terminal was
attached to a glass stand or pillar, so that    end projected;                  its                        to
another  glass stand was attached     wire with one end also pro

jecting, and the other end was fixed            the brass work to     the air                   of
pump.      The two projecting ends could              made       touch,
                                                                      be                   to         or   to
remain       any desired distance from each other.
                at
    The ends       the wires being
                      of                   contact, the coil apparatus was

       at                                                              the re                   in

                                have been able to obtain sparks of
the former class  only, and then the experiment may be continued
indefinitely with no striae visible; but on the slightest alteration
in the distance the striae appear. It                          is,
                                          however, more frequently

others.
    Itisnecessary    mention the above distinctions,

any person repeating the experiments might             deceived, and                be
not succeeding      obtaining discharges without striae, though
                       in
the discharges were apparently single, would imagine the results
I have described        illusions arising from
                        to    be                    error    vision.           an                of
I    repeated the above experiments           one     Mr. Gassiot’s  in         of
vacuum-tubes, which showed the striae beautifully under ordinary
circumstances; but when the division        the circuit was carefully

                            to
without any striae, the tube being filled       each discharge with    at
a uniform glow.
  From the above experiments      am satisfied that I attenuated                         in
media, wherein the striae are well seen when the ordinary inter
rupted currents are used, discharges may      made    pass which          be              to
exhibit no striae, and under such circumstances that there
every reason      believe single discharges only pass. Join
                  to                                                                                        to is

   It will, in the first place, be remembered that the general con
dition satisfied by the free surface of a weightless mass of liquid
in a state of equilibrium is expressed by

where R and R' are the two principal radii of curvature at any
point of the surface, and are considered positive or negative
according as they are directed towards the interior or exterior of
the mass.     C represents a constant.
   It is well known that, in surfaces of revolution, one of the
radii R, R is the radius of curvature of the meridian curve at
the point under consideration, and the other is the portion of the
normal intercepted between this point and the axis of revolution,
or, according to a simpler mode of expression, it is the normal
at this point.   On this account, and in order to avoid     ambi                              all
guity,  I replace the letters   and        R and             R'

First. Since the arc                    of

                                                                                              it

wards greater than that            the circular arc;        the point where            at
the two arcs     rejoin  each  other,    then,  the radius       curvature                    of                      M
of the arc          of
                 the curve      less than the radius
                                         is                  the circular arc;         of
the same        the case, too, with the normal N, for the latter evi
                is
dently cuts the axis            less acute angle than does the radius.
                                        at
                                        a
                 upon the arc        the curve and upon the circular arc
                                                  be of
Secondly.       If
two equally long portions             taken, having      common extremity          a
 on                                                   extremity
                                                                                                    of of
    the   axis, and           so
                         small that        the other         at        the first
the curvature has not yet ceased                 less than that   to    the cir
                                                                       be
cular arc, the normal                    N,
                                  corresponding         this extremity, will     to
evidently           be
                 longer than the radius            the circle, and,     of con                               in

                   which are neither Spherical nor Cylindrical.                                              25
sequence  of the inferior curvature, the radius of curvature M at
this extremity will also be greater than the radius of the circle.
But since, with respect to an arc of a curve thus placed, the
radius of curvature and the normal have a like direction, and
consequently the same sign, it follows from the above that the
 uantit        * +!. would                  be greater at the point where                         this arc
rejoins the circle than at a                      point very close to the axis, a result
which is incompatible with                        the condition of equilibrium.    If we
were to suppose that the                          curvature diminishes from the axis
outwards, the same mode                            of reasoning would show that the
quantity
               *** would                    be smaller at the point where the arc                            of
the curve rejoins that                  of the circle than at a point very near the
aXIS.
   Equilibrium, therefore, is not possible unless the curvature be
constant and, at the same time, the meridian curve meet the
axis normally; in other words, this meridian curve must be a
circle having            its
                     centre                 on
                                 the axis, or,      the case      in   infinite      of     an
radius,   aline  perpendicular         the axis;   to
                                                   hence the    figure   gene
rated     necessarily either
         is                        sphere    a   plane.   or  a

side the   axis;   we shall afterwards find that the first                these                   of

   Since the complete meridian curve cannot terminate                                              as   above
described, the preceding figure    only   partial one.  is        a                            I    follow

same figure.
     Inthe first place, these extreme points cannot     points                            be                  of

 be   there      infinite, and the equation                   of   equilibrium reduced                        to
*=c.
N                But we have seen that, between its vertex and the
points under consideration, the curve presents two points                                               of    in
flection,  which, therefore, the equation really reduces itself

constant on passing from one point to another unless M and N
either increase or decrease simultaneously. But if we were to
suppose that, upon the small arc which forms the production of
the curve, the curvature increases more, or diminishes less
rapidly than upon the other small arc, a little attention will show
that at the extremity of the first the radius of curvature would
be smaller, whilst the normal would be larger than at the extre
mity of the second; and on the other hand, if we were to sup
pose that beyond the minimum point the curvature increases
less, or diminishes more rapidly than on this side, we should
find that at the extremity of the first small arc the radius of cur
vature would be greater, and the normal less than at the extre
mity of the second.
  Thus the constancy of the quantity                         ***    necessitates the
identity, or rather the perfect symmetry of the two small arcs;
but this symmetry involves, as a consequence, that of the two
whole portions of the curve situated on opposite sides of the
minimum point. By repeated applications of the same reasoning
to both extremities of the realized liquid figure, I conclude that
the same reproduces itself indefinitely on both sides. The com
plete meridian curve, therefore, undulates indefinitely alongside
the axis, from which it recedes and towards which it approaches
periodically;     its
                   maxima and minima distances from the same

spreads itself out more over the solid surface, the meridian cur

tracted, whilst at the same      time the node becomes thinner. The
node now belongs neither         to the catenoid nor to the unduloid,
but to a new figure whose        meridian curve we must examine.
   The above explanations        respecting the sphere, the catenoid,
 and the unduloid are sufficient to give an idea of the nature of
 the reasoning applied to the equation of equilibrium; with
 respect to the new figure, therefore, I shall limit myself to the
 following brief indications.
    In the first place, it must be observed that the reasoning by
 means of which, in the case of the unduloid, the perfect sym
 metry of the meridian curve on opposite sides of a minimum
 point was established, applies equally to a minimum point corre
 sponding to any other equilibrium-figure, and consequently to
that of the meridian arc of the node under consideration;–this
 conclusion, we may add, is confirmed by the apparent form of
 the node.      From this it follows that the complete curve has an
 axis of  symmetry     perpendicular to the axis of revolution, and
 passing through the middle of the mode; so that whatever fea
 ture is presented by the curve on one side of the first of these
axes, is presented symmetrically on the other side.
    Pursuing, afterwards, the meridian curve beyond the rings,                                                   I
 show that it passes through two points where               elements are             its
parallel       the above axis
               to                  symmetry, and verify this deduc
                                              of                       I

instead       of
             two  rings, the distance between the discs not exceeding
about the third        their diameter. By gradually subtracting
                         of                                                                                     oil

                               to         the discs.       of

returns towards the axis           symmetry,  of      point    which  in   a               of                   its

consequence                of this form            I    give to the generated figure the name

      The nodoid presents     a remarkable peculiarity: it cannot,

    On   performing   the above     experiments,        means       which                by                  of
 these portions are realized,        becomes evident that the nodoid,

                                     be
made then widens spontaneously, the meridian loop becomes
much shorter, and            point much more blunt. Thus, the

points      the loops

tion would again          be     reduced         to

normals corresponding, respectively,           this and         to

extreme point would       equal, which
                               be           clearly impossible. The

towards the   axis, and hence we see without         difficulty  that                                      its
second extreme point will         infinitely distant from this axis,
                                            be
and that the normal will               be
                               there infinite.     But, evidently, the
radius    of
          curvature will also be infinite         this second extreme at
point,    so   that the quantity          s              +&   will     be   there equal           to   zero,
which     impossible, since
          is                 the first extreme point this quantity
                                       at
has   afinite value.    The condition      equilibrium, therefore,

cannot be satisfied.
  Thus the only equilibrium-figures                        of

   All these figures, the sphere excepted, having infinite dimen

   Upon the whole, I consider from a comparison of experiments,
principally those of Colonel Beaufoy, that when the velocity in
knots per hour is v, the resistance in pounds per fathom will, for
the cable here supposed, be nearly enough represented by .012w”.
   For the sake of brevity I shall take only the example of this
cable at an angle of 20°, where the velocity     we see, 4.8 knots                         is,
per hour.    Now,  taking the depth      the sea   2000 fathoms,      of                         at

              a                      per cent.    the  cable,  would only

reduce the strain     upon    the cable without occasioning excessive
waste, unless             at   ‘Leviathan' speed.

     may just remark, that if the ship moved with an accelerated
velocity, the cable would form a curve with the convexity up
wards, and on the other hand, if she moved with a retarded
velocity, the cable would form a curve with the convexity down
wards.
   With a brake-apparatus properly contrived and worked by
practised seamen, the sending and pitching of the vessel in
moderate weather ought not materially to increase the strain on
the cable, and the nearer the brake-apparatus can be made to
approach in              its
                 action that  (that exquisitely delicate and simple

   That we are not acquainted with a very great number of such
instances of replacement, appears to arise from the circumstance
that, in few hydrogenized bodies, can the hydrogen be replaced
with equal facility by chlorine and by potassium. As a general
rule, we find that the facility of replacement by potassium is
directly, by chlorine inversely, as the degree of oxidation of
the compound under examination, and consequently that the
same body does not always afford both chlorine and metal
derivatives. Chlorine and potassium are two elements possessing
in the highest degree those opposite properties which we de
nominate chlorous and basylous respectively.     They are, how
ever, connected  by a great number of intermediate links, and
constitute, as it were, the extremities of a very long chain.
From the antagonism in properties possessed by chlorous and
basylous elements, we find that the correspondence in properties
between chlorous and basylous derivatives of the same hydro
genized body is confined within narrow limits; it      however,          is,
manifested    the phaenomena

by   Hofmann,    thus:–            -         *

that an atom of the same element under different conditions has
several   different representative values.    Thus, if we take three
atoms of     chlorhydric   acid,  H°CI*,   we can replace the three
atoms of    hydrogen   by  three atoms of potassium, to obtain three
atoms of chloride of potassium, K*Cl”.          But in three atoms of
chlorhydric acid, H°Cl”, we can also replace the three atoms of
hydrogen by one atom of bismuth, and thereby obtain the body
Bi Cl”, or terchloride of bismuth ; whence it is evident that the
atom of bismuth is equivalent

   In the above formulae, despite the different numbers of the
atoms, the same equivalent or exponential value is maintained
throughout.      Equivalency is quite independent of an equality
of  atoms,  but relates solely to functions and relations.          When
the same    body  has several functions, it is likewise possessed of
several equivalents.      The majority of chemists have heretofore
confounded the      equivalent    value of a body with             atomic                             its
weight,   its equivalent with        atom, whichits        conceive, un         is,

not each contain some one special, pre-formed, self-existent, com
pound radical, but might be considered to contain exactly as
many compound radicals as they contained atoms of hydrogen;
and that the abstraction of one atom of hydrogen left a mono
basic radical, of two atoms of hydrogen a bibasic radical, and of
three atoms of hydrogen a tribasic radical, and so on.         showed               I
that marsh-gas contained a monobasic radical, methyle; a bibasic
radical, methylene; a tribasic radical, formyle; and a quadribasic

 bodies, but simply as useful means of manifesting their relations
 and modes of formation.
    Kekulé has recently published a paper in which these views
 are brought      forward more definitely, and with an amount
 of illustration heretofore not possible.       He has shown how the
abstraction of   hydrogen    increases the  basicity of the radical, and
how compounds containing mult-equivalent radicals may be
rationally represented by several formulae.         Semi-benzidine, for
 instance, may be represented either as a di-ammonia, in which
two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by the bi-equivalent radical
 (C*H*)", or else as benzine, in which two of hydrogen are replaced
by two of amidogen, &c. *
    The circumstance that the single atoms of certain elements
and groupings have each the property of replacing two, three, or
more atoms of hydrogen by equivalent substitution, that thcy
are, in fact, mult-equivalent, is now, I believe, generally admitted.
But, prior to the recognition of mult-equivalent radicals,
Gerhardt, who first pointed out the difference between the atomic
weight and equivalent of an element, contrived to make           atomic             all
weights correspond with the hydrogen equivalent,           according       by                  to
several   of the elements two distinct atomic weights. Thus, for
iron we had two atoms, ferrosum =28, and ferricum             18.7; for         =
platinum        had two atoms, platinosum =985, and platinicum.
                we
 =49.2 for
       ;        bismuth,   antimony, and aluminium we had bismi
thicum, antimonicum, and aluminicum respectively.             Gerhardt
certainly employed ferricum and          congeners its    atomic sense,
                                                                      in   an
and Laurent distinctly argued that they had every right                                   to   be
considered       as
                atoms. Each       these atoms was respectively equiva

                          of      and was represented         own par      by   its
ticular  symbol,          as
                     illustrated     the  following

   These formulae are,    conceive, perfectly admissible, and occa

quantities; but    used   if represent the atoms

                                               the elements which
can enter into combinations, they are,          conceive, incorrect.

equivalent quantities, not of atomic weights. But inasmuch as
a writer* in this country has recently advocated the use of
Gerhardt’s equivalents in what I conceive to be their incorrect
sense, it may be worth while to state the objections.           It is evi

 oxidizing action upon oxidizable bodies, and even upon the noble
 metals, nevertheless Schönbein has found that strips of paper,
coloured with peroxide of lead, become bleached when intro
 duced in a moist condition into strongly ozonified air, owing to
the reduction of the peroxide into the protoxide of lead.          Such

oxygen atoms, which, in their relation to foreign bodies, must natu
rally differ from those atoms which are combined, two and two, to
molecules, are, in my opinion, ozone.
   Let us now consider, in the first place, the most important
modes of formation of ozone.
    If electricity passes out into oxygen or atmospheric air, or if
electric sparks are discharged through either of these gases,
ozone is formed; and this formation is independent of the
nature of the electricity, that           whether        is,

     The   principal   action,   namely      the   strongly   oxidizing power,

                 isclear that separated oxygen atoms can more
easily enter into combination with foreign bodies than such                                                        as

a state fit for combination with other substances.                        -
    In this respect ozone is comparable with oxygen in the mas
cent state, with the exception that with the latter the electrical
condition must be taken into account in addition; for when
oxygen is evolved out of a compound in which it was electro
negative, it will for two reasons easily enter into another com
bination in which it has also to play an electro-negative part:
first, because the atoms are still in the separate state; secondly,
because they already are in the proper electrical condition.
Hence oxygen in the nascent state may in many cases surpass
ozone in activity.
    The galvanic polarization of a plate of platinum, by immersion
in ozonified oxygen, is related to the above action.           is known                It
that the two   electrodes,  which serve        the       in for

these moving atoms, on coming into contact with the oxide, are
able to withdraw the atoms of oxygen which are only feebly
combined. This accounts at the same time for the double effect,
—the reduction of the oxide and the disappearance of the ozone.
   The behaviour of ozone is in many respects similar to that
of the peroxides.  Peroxide of hydrogen, for instance, has, as is
well known, a strong oxidizing action, by reason of the facility
with which it gives up                 its
                                 second atom          oxygen.           of the               If,   on

reciprocal reduction takes place.          We may         such       case pre in            a
sume that the    oxygen-atoms       liberated from the      peroxide       hy                      of

52                          Royal Society:—
    A sufficient body of the larger disturbances to permit an exami
mation   of their laws having been separated from the rest of the ob
servations, it was found at Point Barrow, as elsewhere wherever a
similar investigation has been made, that in regard to the frequency
of their occurrence, and to the mean amounts of easterly and west
erly deflection produced by them, the disturbances follow system
atic laws depending on the hours of solar time. The laws of the
easterly and of the westerly disturbances were also found, at Point
Barrow as elsewhere, to be distinct and dissimilar.       On further  in
stituting a comparison between the disturbance-laws at Point Barrow
and Toronto, it was found that although the laws of the deflections
of the same name at the two stations did not correspond, there
existed, on the other hand, a very striking and remarkable correspond
ence between the laws of the easterly disturbances at Point Barrow
and of the westerly at Toronto, and between the laws of the westerly
disturbances at Point Barrow and easterly at Toronto. The corre
spondence is traced in much detail, for the purpose of showing that
it is manifested, not in slight and unimportant particulars, but in the
most marked characteristics of both classes of phenomena.          From
the correspondence in the hours at which opposite disturbance-deflec
tions prevail, it follows, that the portion of the diurnal variation
which depends upon the disturbances, has opposite, or nearly
opposite characteristics at the two stations.
    In former papers the author considers that he has shown that,
for the purpose of obtaining a correct knowledge of the phenomena
of the regular solar diurnal variation, it is necessary to eliminate the
influence of that portion of the observed diurnal variation which
proceeds from the disturbances; and he now adduces the observa
tions at Point Barrow as strongly confirmatory of this.       When the
diurnal variation is derived from the whole body of the observations
at Point Barrow, retaining the disturbances, the westerly extreme of
the diurnal excursion, which, as is well known, occurs generally in
the extra-tropical part of the northern hemisphere at a little after
 1 P.M., is found to take place at 11 P.M.; but when the larger
 disturbances are omitted, the westerly extreme falls at the same
hour as elsewhere, viz. a little after 1 P.M. The author takes
 occasion to suggest the probability that the anomalies which have
been supposed to exist elsewhere in the turning-hours of the solar
 diurnal variation in high latitudes may be susceptible of a similar
explanation.
    It appears, therefore, by the comparison of the Point Barrow and
 Toronto observations, that in the regular solar diurnal variation the
 progression at the two stations is similar, the easterly and westerly
 extremes being reached nearly at the same hours; whilst in the
 disturbance diurnal variation the progression is reversed, the easterly
 extreme at the one station coinciding very nearly with the westerly
 extreme at the other.     This contrariety seems the more remarkable,
 since both variations appear to have the same primary or exciting
 cause, viz. the sun; inasmuch as in each the period is a solar day.
 The author draws the probable inference, that whilst the primary

             On Hourly Observations                            of the Magnetic Declination.                                53
cause is the same in both, the mode of operation is different in the
two cases.
   Another important distinction between the phèmomena of the
solar diurnal variation and of the disturbance variation at Point Bar
row and Toronto, is shown by the author to consist in the comparative
magnitude of their range. The increase in the range of the solar diurnal
variation between Toronto and Point Barrow             nearly    may be,               is,   as              as
    the inverse ratio of the values of the horizontal force of the earth
at in
    the two stations (which         the antagonistic force opposing
                                                        is                                                                  all
magnetic variations); whilst                              on

   When the frequency of the Aurora at the different hours is com

      “On the Expansion of Wood by Heat.” By                                         J.   P. Joule,         LL.D.,
 F.R.S. &c.
     In pursuing the researches of which abstracts have been given in
  the ‘Proceedings' for January 29 and June 18*, the author found
  that the heat evolved by compressing wood, cut either in or across the
  direction of the grain, was nearly that due to the application to the
  particular case of Professor Thomson's formula.               Exact agreement
  could not be expected, on account of the discordant results arrived at
 by different experimenters on the expansion of wood. On investi
 gating the subject, the author finds that the expansion of wood cut
 in the direction of the grain, is greatly influenced by the tension to
 which it is exposed, as well as by                       an its

 The object of the memoir is to enumerate the number of such par
titions that can be made with K diapeds in the vertex and k diagonals
in the bases of the pyramid. By the drawing of k diagonals, the
pyramid becomes a          1)-acral (r--k+1)-edron, which by the in
troduction of K diapeds becomes a (r--K+1)-acral (r-H k+1)-edron.
Such a figure is termed an r-gonous (r-H K+1)-acral (r-H k+1)-edron
of the first class. The definition of an r-gonous w-edron of the first
class is that it contains a discrete r-gony, i. e. K diapeds and k
diagonals of which no diaped meets a diagonal, and such that the
convanescence    of the K diapeds will form an r-ace, and the eva
 nescence of the diagonals forms an r-gon.
   If  the summits upon the k diagonals be, one or more of them
partitioned by K' diapeds, or the faces about the K diapeds be par
titioned by k' diagonals, there arises a mixed r-gony, in which are one
or more angles made by a diaped and a diagonal.        such a figure                     If
has not a discrete r-gony as well as that mixed one, and has no
(r--r')-gony, by the vanescence of which the (r-Fr')-pyramid can
be obtained, it is an r-gonous r-edron of the second class. And
rigonous w-edra of the third class can be obtained by partitioning
the faces about the K' diapeds and the summits upon the k" diagonals,
in such a manner that no (r--r')-gony shall be introduced; and so
on for higher classes of r-gonous r-edra.

    In the foregoing comparative Chart of the physical properties of
the two salts, the axis has been assumed to coincide with a line
 drawn through the short diagonal of the primary rhombic crystal,
which will coincide with the long diameter of the a-prism, and the
plane of the breadth of the 6-prism, and is therefore the T" of the
                                                                   -
three rectangular crystallographic axes.
   It has been compiled from the observations of Professors Stokes
and Haidinger and the author.           It appears to form a complete
optical description of the two salts, as far as they are at present known.
   Whilst in both salts the indicative body-colours, or those due to
the more absorbed pencils (3), are only to be seen in the thinnest
crystals, it is evident that the reflected rays may be seen indifferently
in crystals of all thicknesses; and the author is inclined to believe
that the cinchonidine salt possesses even greater tourmaline absorbent
powers upon ordinary light, inasmuch as much thinner plates are
required in order to obtain the indicative body-colours,             perfect
absorption, and therefore total obstruction, being more early arrived
at than in the case of the quinine salt.
   The author's more recent analyses of the cinchonidine salts have
produced the following results:—

than 1 per cent. of sulphuric acid, undergo a transformation, and
become long, golden, silky aciculae, radiating in beautiful globose
tufts : this salt has some doubly absorbent powers also, but very
feeble. When this salt is attempted to be redissolved in boiling
spirit, in order to be recrystallized, it does not re-form, but the
optical crystals are then produced; when the silky crystals are
 carefully air-dried, they retain their yellow colour, but if exposed
over sulphuric acid at 62°Fahr., or if attempted to be dried at 212°
 Fahr., they lose 5:32 per cent. water=6 atoms, and become a dark

Consequently the silky salt will be the optical salt-H4 atoms of
water,           under the influence of excess of sulphuric acid and
prolonged delay at 62°Fahr., are assimilated by that salt; and
which additional water, on boiling in spirit, is lost, and the optical
salt recrystallized on cooling.
     Ifthe temperature be not too high at first, the silky crystals
may be produced without the appearance of the optical.        And the
silky crystals at 212°, or at 62°Fahr. over sulphuric acid, become the
dry residue or tri-hydrate, which, when boiled in spirit, becomes the
optical, by assimilating 2 atoms of water, as may be seen by com

   The cinchonine and quinidine salts further agree in containing
only 1 atom sulphuric acid, whereas the quinine and cinchonidine
salts contain 2 atoms.
   These investigations appear to show that the alkaloids in each
instance undergo some modification, but not analogous to substitu
tion; it appears more like a splitting-up into different molecular
groups, and a rearrangement of these amongst themselves, as the
formulae of the organic bases differ much from those of the original
alkaloids.
   All these iodo-salts possess double refractive properties.
   When the acid sulphates of the mixed alkaloids, quinine, quinidine,
cinchonine and cinchonidine, are dissolved in dilute spirit, and the
temperature increased to 80° or 120°, treatment with tincture of
iodine readily separates the quinine salt first.
   Subsequent further treatment in the same manner produces the
cinchonidine salt, more or less mixed with the quinine salt.
   On still further treatment, the quinidine salt is formed with                                          its
 well-marked characters.
     The cinchonine salt      by far the most soluble
                                     is                        spirit; and             in
when   a large  quantity         of
                            cinchonine exists,  this   compound   will also

 derived from a rhombic prism.              The reflected tints are brownish
 olive, not unlike dead leaves, or brown beech-leaves.               These crystals
are more doubly absorbent than either the quinidine or cinchonine
 salt, but less powerfully optical as tourmalines than the quinine or
cinchonidine compounds.              When polarized, they transmit a sienna
brown     body-colour    if  moderately    thick, and thicker plates are bistre
brown, but when sufficiently thick, they are wholly impervious to
plane-polarized light. The substance was not in sufficient quantity
to admit of any analysis.
    It is well known that quinine and quinidine, under the continued
effect of heat and dilute sulphuric acid, undergo a molecular change
into quinicine, which M. Pasteur has asserted to be isomeric with
the original alkaloids, but hitherto no complete analysis has been
made of the metamorphosed alkaloids.
    The author has produced an iodo-sulphate of quinicine, but it is
no longer a crystalline compound ; it presents itself as a deep blood
coloured resin, very soluble in spirit and readily precipitated by water
from       its
            spirituous solution.       This substance has not yet been sub

     The following communication was read:—
     “On the Chemical Action of Water on Soluble
                                            -    Salts.”                                         By Dr.
J.    H. Gladstone, F.R.S.
    Before extending my researches on chemical affinity among sub
stances   in solution, it seemed desirable to ascertain, if possible, what
specific chemical action water exerts on a salt. This inquiry is beset
with unusual difficulties, and unfortunately my experiments have not
led to any conclusive result.         Yet some of the observations made
 during the course of the inquiry have a value independent of theory,
 and a brief notice of them may not perhaps be deemed unworthy of
 a place in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
    It is well known that many anhydrous salts will absorb water, and
 still remain solid bodies, either amorphous or crystallized.             In such
 a case the water combined is always in simple atomic relation with
 the salt itself; great heat is often evolved, and a change of colour
 frequently ensues.      These “hydrated” salts (as they are usually
 considered) are generally soluble in water; and it is the condition
of such a body when dissolved that opens a wide field for speculation.
The water may act merely as a solvent; or it may unite without de
composition with the dissolved salt, becoming an integral part of the
 compound in solution; or reciprocal decomposition may ensue, each
 electro-positive element combining with each electro-negative one in
 certain proportions; or the ultimate result may be due to two or more-
of these modes of action in conjunction.                               -
    When a “hydrated” salt is dissolved in a minimum of water,
nothing is usually observed beyond the new physical properties
resulting from the change in           state       its
                                                  aggregation and the absorp

            On the Chemical Action                        of Water       on Soluble Salts.              67
   This was closely examined. It might be expected, a priori, that
a certain amount of salt would have the same absorbent effect on a
given quantity of light, whether it were dissolved in much or little
water, and that as the absorbent power of water is practically nil, it
would appear to the eye of precisely the same depth and character
of colour in the two cases. And this actually holds good in the
majority of instances; but to prove it a special contrivance was
necessary, in order to make the same quantity of light impinge upon
the solution before and after dilution. This was effected by means
of colourless cylindrical glasses of uniform diameter and the same
size, closed at one end with a flat plate of glass, so that when placed
upright they could hold liquids: they stood in a case so contrived

  That      these changes            of colour are due to the action of the water,
and not to any merely physical cause, is proved by the fact that
alcohol does not occasion them.                   Quantitative experiments were
instituted with acetate of copper and sulphocyanide of iron, to deter
mine whether the effect of successive additions of water is in a
decreasing ratio.          It was found to be so on the whole, but the
results showed certain irregularities that do not usually occur in
cases of reciprocal decomposition, where the mass of one of the-
compounds is successively increased.
    A prismatic examination of the rays absorbed by these salts in
 different states of solution revealed two very suggestive facts. The
 one  is,  that       every case (except ferric acetate) the salt
                      in                                                          dilute                    in

                                                                                                                 it
                                                                                                                 in
 saturated solution, but also some rays which                 then absorbed. Theit
 other     is,
             that   strong   solutions       the  chlorides,
                                                    of        bromides,    and iodides
of    copper, cobalt, nickel, and iron—analogous metals—exhibit not
 only the absorption due             the respective bases, but another absorp

 tions are diluted, they cease              produce this second absorption, and
                                                    to
 give precisely the same prismatic image                     any compound     as     the                         of
 same base with          colourless acid.

 effect this change depends                    on

mide of that metal, a reduction in colour ensues, and an analogous
result is obtained when the double sulphate of copper and potash
acts on the acetate of copper—facts which point to a decomposition
of the double salt in solution. Indeed it is evident that some double
salts are resolved more or less into their components by water, while
others are not so affected.
   The general tendency of my observations has led me to the opinion,
that water does not act upon a salt dissolved in it in a manner analo

   Feb. 9, 1857.-Prof. Challis gave an account of his Observation
of the Occultation of Jupiter on Jan. 2, 1857.
   Feb. 23.—A paper was read “On the Theory of Polarized Fasci
culi, commonly known as Haidinger's Brushes.”       By the Rev.             J.
Power,  M.A., Librarian of the University.
   In this paper the view taken of the subject is similar to that
which had occurred to M. Jamin, and which will be found in Pog
gendorff's Annalen, 1849, p. 145, and in the Comptes Rendus, tome
xxvi. p. 197. The author arrived, however, at the present theory
quite independently in the course of last summer, and before he had
acquainted himself with the literature of the subject.    M. Jamin
had taken as an essai de calcul the particular semi-visual angle 20°,
which lies far beyond the limits within which the phaenomenon is
visible; and he has not attempted to give the general law for small
angles, which was the real problem to be solved.
   This is what the author has attempted in the present communica
tion, availing himself of the experimental researches of Chossat
given in the Bulletin de la Soc. Philomatique, 1818, p. 94.
   The subject was rendered more complicated by the circumstance
that the formulae for the intensities of the refracted pencils are given
differently by Neumann, Airy, and the author of this paper. Instead
of taking any one set of formulae, the author managed to take them
all into consideration by previously showing that Airy's formulae

   It follows from thence that, whichever set of formulae we may

     This fraction decreases as the deviation 0–0, increases; it is
therefore less for the violet rays than the red, for the indigo than
for the yellow; and this serves to explain in a general way the dingy
yellow stripe in the plane of polarization, and the bright violet stripe
in the plane at right angles.
   The author has also considered the effect in a plane making an
angle q, with the plane of greatest polarization, and arrives at the
following result: that, provided we attribute to the distribution of
the optic nerve such a variation of sensibility as, taken in conjunc
tion with the action of the iris, shall produce a field of view uni
formly bright from the centre outwards when common daylight is
viewed (a condition which the author believes is common to all eyes
with his own), we shall have for the brightness at any point of the
field of view the following expression,                    -
           -                                                          2p),

     1. “On the Lower Carboniferous Coal-measures of British Ame
 rica.” By J.W. Dawson, LL.D., F.G.S.
     Deposits indicating the existence of the Coal-flora and its asso
 ciated freshwater fauna at the beginning of the Carboniferous period
 are well developed in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, with a clear
 mess and fulness of detail capable of throwing much light on the
 dawn of the terrestrial conditions of the Coal-period, and on the re
 lations of these lower beds to the true coal-measures.         This lower
 series  comprises   shales and sandstones (destitute of marine remains,
 but    containing   fossil plants, fishes, entomostraca, worm-tracks,
 ripple-  and rain-marks, sun-cracks, reptilian footprints, and erect
 trees) and great overlying marine limestones and gypsums.           These
 are distinct from the true coal-measures by their position, mineral
 character, and fossil remains.       In the western part of Nova Scotia
 (Horton, Windsor, &c.) the true (or Upper and Middle) coal-mea
 sures are not developed; and here the Lower Carboniferous marine
 deposits attain their greatest thickness.       The lower coal-measures
 (or Lower Carboniferous freshwater or estuarine deposits) have here
 a thickness of about 600 feet. These beds are traceable as far as
 the Shubenacadie and Stewiacke Rivers. They outcrop also on the
 south side of the Cobequid Mountains, where the marine portion is
 very thin, owing perhaps to the fact of these mountains having
 been land in the coal-period.
     Along the northern side of the Cobequid Range the upper and
 middle coal-measures and the marine portion of the Lower Carboni
  ferous series are of great thickness. The freshwater beds are absent
  here, though brought up on the northern side of the coal-trough of
  Cumberland, where, as well as in New Brunswick (Petitcodiac
  River, &c.), they are remarkable for their highly bituminous com
  position, their well-preserved fish-remains, and the almost entire
  absence of plants.     To the north, at the Bay of Chaleurs, the great
  calcareous   conglomerate,   with sandstone and shale, 2766 feet thick,
  described by Logan, and containing a few plant-remains, probably
  represent the Lower Coal-measures of Nova Scotia.              In eastern
  Nova Scotia and Cape Breton the Middle Coal-measures are found

On the Lower Carboniferous Coal-measures of British America. 73
at Caribou Cove and elsewhere; the marine limestones and gypsums,
and the underlying sandstones and shales, are seen at Plaister
Cove; also at Right's River, and St. Mary's River.
    In Nova Scotia these older coal-measures, as compared with the
true coal-measures, are more calcareous, more rich in remains of
fishes, and have fewer vegetable remains, and indications of terres
trial surfaces. They occur generally along the margins of the coal
areas, near their old shores; and, as might be expected under such
circumstances, they are associated with or replaced by beds of con
glomerate derived from the neighbouring highlands of Devonian or
Silurian rocks. When the conglomerates are absent, alternations of
sandstones with sandy and calcareous shales occur, with frequent
changes in character of the organic remains, the general aspect
being that of muddy estuarine deposits, accumulated very slowly,
and discoloured by decaying organic substances.         The supply of
 sediment, and the growth and preservation of vegetable matter,
appear to have been generally on a smaller scale in this early carbo
niferous period than subsequently. In those districts where the true
 coal-measures are least developed the lower series is most important;
 showing that the physical and vital conditions of the Coal-measures
 originated as early as those of Mountain-limestone; and that locally
 these conditions may have been contemporaneous throughout the
 whole period; but that in some localities the estuary and swamp
 deposits first formed were completely submerged and covered by
 oceanic deposits, whilst in others early marine beds were elevated
 and subjected to the conditions of gradual subsidence and vegetable
 growths indicated in the great coal-measures of the South Joggins,
Pictou, and Sidney.
   In Nova Scotia the Lower Coal-measures are characterized by a
great preponderance of Lepidodendra (especially L. elegans) and
Poacites.    The Middle Coal-measures are rich in Sigillariae and
Ferns, as well as Lepidodendra. The Upper Coal-measures especially
abound in Conifers, Calamites, and Ferns.          Palaeoniscus, Gyrolepis
or Acrolepis,  Centrodus, Rhizodus,  and Ctenacanthus are the chief fossil
fishes of this Lower Carboniferous series.           Unio-like shells are
nearly the only remains of Molluscs.
   2. “On the Structure of Stigmaria ficoides.”           By E. W. Binney,
Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, having lately met with several specimens of this singular
root which exhibit good structural characters, was enabled in this
paper to throw some additional light on the origin of the medullary
rays in Stigmaria, the nature of the vascular bundles which were
believed to be dispersed throughout         its
                                            pith, and the structure  of  the
central   or  vascular portion   of     rootlet,_points
                                      its                     ofconsiderable
interest, and which    up   tothe present time have not been well de
termined.      Mr. Binney confirms Dr. Hooker's view         the medullary

  those described by M. Brongniart as occurring in the woody part
  of Sigillaria elegans.     In a rootlet Mr. Binney finds evidence of an
  outer ring of fine cellular tissue, three or four cells broad, and in
  the centre of the middle space twenty-seven large and eleven smaller
  vessels, forming a mass of vascular tissue tºoth of an inch in dia
  meter, the vessels or utricles being distinctly marked with trans
  verse striae.
     3. “On a New Fossil Fern from Worcestershire.”               By John
  Morris, Esq., F.G.S.                          -
     A few fragments of fern-leaflets, found by Mr. G. Roberts, of
  Kidderminster, in a micaceous sandstone about two miles north-east
  of Bewdley, exhibit a reticulate venation; a character comparatively
  rare in the Coal-measures.       These specimens are but fragments of
  the  frond;   and the one   particularly referred to is probably the ter
  minal   part  of a  pinna.    The author doubtfully referred it to the
  genus Woodwardites, with the specific name Robertsi.

     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On some of the Glacial Phaenomena of Canada and of the
  North-eastern Provinces of the United States during the Drift
 period.”     By Prof. A. C. Ramsay, F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author first described the evidently glacialized condition of
 the great Laurentine Chain of mountains, on the north side of the
 St. Lawrence, which for an extent of 1500 miles exhibit, often in
 spite of the forest, unequivocal signs of glacial abrasion, being
 mammillated (or moutonnées), as if by the action of ice.
     On the south side of the river, the country is low, and covered
 with boulders and other drifts, derived from the Laurentine Chain
 and other tracts, in accordance with the observations of Bigsby,
 Hitchcock, and others. The plains and the Thousand Islands ex
 hibit a general glacialization.     These conditions are traceable down
 the Valley of the Hudson to New York.
    During the period when the boulders and the associated clays and
 gravels were being deposited, the Catskill Mountains appear to have
 been under water, and at about the same period to have been sub
jected also to very extensive glacial action. The striae left by ice
 borne rocks on the eastern flank of the Catskills have a north and
 south direction, and are found up to nearly the height of 3000 feet
 above the sea, excepting in the east and west gorges near the top,
where the striae run in a cross direction—E. and W. The sea of
the drift-period in the Valley of the Hudson was then from 3000 to
4000 feet deep. The deep valleys on the western side of the moun
tains were observed by Prof. Ramsay to be often charged with drift,
which had not been ploughed out by glaciers of a date subsequent
to the upheaval of the Catskills, as is the case with some of the
valleys, once occupied by drift and afterwards by glaciers, in Wales,
the Highlands, the Vosges, and in the Alps.
    Prof. Ramsay then referred more particularly to the drift-deposits
forming terraces in the neighbourhood of Montreal, which have lately

             Mr. G. P. Scrope             on Lamination and Cleavage.                        75
been described in detail by Dr. Dawson; and pointed out his reasons
for regarding the Leda-clay of Dawson to be of contemporaneous
formation with the Nucula-clay of the eastern side of Lake Champlain,
and with the clay-beds of Albany and elsewhere on the Hudson.           The
clay of the Hudson Valley lies on boulder-beds, and rarely contains
boulders.     Along Lake Champlain similar clays overlie old drift, at
about 150 feet above the sea-level, and contain fossils similar to
those of the Montreal clays, at 140 feet above the sea, and of other
contemporaneous beds on the Ottawa. Prof. Ramsay assumed Dr.
Dawson's conclusion as to the age of the Leda-beds, which were
 deposited, in a thickness of from 100 to 300 feet, over the boulder
clay, whilst the sea covered the Ontario basin, and came up against
 the great escarpment of Niagara limestone, which, now stretching
 across this region, formed the southern coast of the glacial sea.
    The author then inferred that, the Erie plateau having been ele
vated, the falls of Niagara commenced, by the drainage of the upper
lake-area, a little before the close of the drift-period, falling first into
 the sea over the edge of the escarpment above Queenstown and
 Lewistown. If the 35,000 years suggested by Sir C. Lyell as the
 minimum for the time occupied in the erosion of the gorge of Niagara
 be approximately    correct, though probably below the reality, we
 have an idea of the amount of time that has elapsed since the close
 of the drift-period. And, if it be ever found possible to accurately
 determine the ancient rate of recession, we shall have data for a first
 approach to an actual measurement of a portion of geological time.
 This subject is intimately connected with the synchronism of the
 mastodon-bearing freshwater strata of Niagara and those of the bluffs
of the Mississippi.
   2.     “On Lamination    and Cleavage occasioned by the mutual fric
tion of the     particles   of rocks while in irregular motion.”              By
G. Poulett    Scrope,   Esq., M.P.,     F.R.S.,   F.G.S.
   The author referred to a former paper read by him before the
Society in April 1856, in which this subject was touched upon, and
proposed to carry on the inquiry as to the probable effect, upon the
internal structure of rocks, of the mutual friction of their com
ponent parts, when forced into motion under extreme and irregular
pressures.     He commenced by examining the laws that determine
the internal motions of substances possessing a more or less imper
fect liquidity, whether homogeneous, or consisting of solid particles
suspended        in,  mixed with,
                       or                  lubricated by, any liquid, under
                                               or
unequal pressures; and showed that unequal rates                         of
                                                                  motion must
result     the different parts
           in                         the substance, and that

          CHEMICAL LITHOLOGY.     BY T. STERRY HUNT.
     In
      a    communication                      to   the Royal Society             of   London, read                 on   the

7th of May, 1857*, I showed that solutions of alkaline carbonates
may give rise to the formation of silicates of lime, magnesia, and
protoxide of iron, when heated to 212°F, with mixtures of the car
bonates of these bases with quartz, a silicate of the alkali being first
formed, and then decomposed by the earthy carbonates.           Shortly
after, in my report of the Geological Survey for 1856, I suggested
that the alkaline silicates might combine with silicate of alumina to
form those felspathic and micaceous minerals which are so generally
associated with the silicates of protoxide bases; I further suggested
that these minerals might be crystallized by the aid of heated alkaline
solutions under pressure, and I thus endeavoured to explain the
development of crystals of felspar and mica, in sedimentary rocks,
even where the organic remains are still preserved.
   While arranging an apparatus in which I proposed to heat under
pressure a solution of carbonate of potash with silica and kaolin, in
the hope of obtaining a double silicate of alumina and potash, M.
Daubrée announced to the French Academy of Sciences (Comptes
Rendus, Nov. 16, 1857) that he had succeeded in obtaining cry
stalline felspar, mixed with crystals of quartz, by heating during a
month, a mixture of kaolin and silicate of potash to 400° C.         He
has moreover shown that felspars and pyroxenes are very stable in
presence of heated alkaline solutions, and that crystallized diopside
and Wollastonite are formed when artificial glasses, containing lime
and iron, are heated in the same way to 400° C. in the presence of
a small amount of water. The alkaline silicate which separates from
the decomposition of the glass is resolved into quartz, which forms
regular crystals, and a soluble silicate having the formula SiO, KO.
   These results of M. Daubrée serve in the most remarkable manner
to confirm my theory of the normal metamorphism of sedimentary
rocks at temperatures below ignition, by the intervention of solutions
of alkaline silicates, which convert mixtures of quartz and earthy
carbonates into the corresponding silicates, and clays into felspars
and mica, the intervention of alumina sometimes generating chlorite,
epidote and garnet.
   Daubrée remarks that glass when thus heated in presence of water
swells up, indicating a softening and a plasticity of the mass; and he
observes that his experiments enable us to understand the part which
water may have played in the formation of the igneous rocks.        His
observations go far to support the views of Poulett Scrope and
 Scheerer, who maintain the aqueo-igneous fusion of granites and
lavas, a theory which is further sustained by the curious micro
scopical investigations of Mr. Sorby lately presented to the Geologi
cal Society of London't.
   Sir John F. W. Herschel many years since put forward a theory
of volcanos, in which he suggested that all volcanic and plutonic
rocks were no other than sedimentary deposits, melted down with
their included water. I have endeavoured, in a paper read on the
6th of March before the Canadian Institute at Toronto, to show that
this theory is the one most in accordance with the present state of
                        * Phil. Mag. vol. xv. p. 68.

chemical and geological science.     We are probably acquainted with
no rocks not of    aqueous   origin;  and the intrusive form so often
assumed by granites, syenites, dolerites, and even by ophiolites and
limestones, is not essential but accidental.
   In my report for 1856, p. 485, I have insisted that the separation
of oxide of iron from certain strata, and its accumulation in others, is
to be ascribed to the reducing and solvent action of organic matters.
This is exemplified in the fire-clays and iron-stones of the coal for
mation, as well as in the series of the Hudson-river group described
in my report, in the fire-clays and greensands of the cretaceous for
mation of New Jersey, and many other instances.           It is by the
alteration of such materials that the white felspathic rocks of
metamorphic regions have been formed; and it is probable that beds
of iron ore always owe their origin to the intervention of organic
matters, so that the presence of such ores, not less than that of
graphite, points to the existence of organic life even during the
Laurentian or so-called Azoic period.
   The waters which dissolve out the oxide of iron from sediments,
also remove lime and magnesia, especially if these bases are present
in the condition of carbonates, and hence these bases, especially the
latter and more soluble, are generally absent from white clays and
felspar rocks.           If,

                                          removed while         portion     alime

                     the other hand, the reducing agency                 organic       of
matters    be excluded, carbonated waters may remove lime and mag
nesia, leaving the peroxide              of
                                   iron behind.
    From my own and others analyses                        of
                                                 the alkaline mineral waters

which the lime, magnesia, and oxide            iron have been dissolved, are

 for the winter groups and summer groups of lunations for the
 magnetic inclination and total force were given at each lunar
 hour in the same volume.     The results for the lunations of both
 years for the two components of force were projected and will be
 found in the Edinburgh Transactions, read in January and April
 1846.    General Sabine's investigation, which       have not yet                                    I

 general results (published in 1850) the projections of the diurnal
curve, due to lunar influence, described by the north end of a
needle freely suspended in the direction of the magnetic dip.
     I
As have not noted in the volume referred to the results dedu
cible from this curve, I shall state them shortly here.
    1st. The amount of motion due to lunar influence of a freely
suspended needle is a maximum twice in a lunar day, namely
during the hours before and after the moon’s transit of the infe
rior meridian, and at the transit of the superior meridian. It
is a minimum twice; a principal minimum six hours after the
superior transit, and a secondary minimum six hours after the
inferior transit.
   2nd. The greatest amount of motion occurs while the moon
is below the horizon. This result, if confirmed, is very curious,
                                                                         on we

needle were most irregular   in the evening was remarked by Cas
sini (and  probably  by  earlier observers); but, as far as I am
aware, the first careful investigation is due to M. Kreil.  This
physicist concluded that the perturbations were a maximum in
the evening from 8° to 10h P.M., and a minimum in the morning
from 8h to 10h A.M. The law for the disturbance of force was
found to have different epochs.   These conclusions were verified
by different persons, and by myself to a certain extent.
    Ifound that these results were on the whole due to a combi
nation of different and even opposite laws; my conclusion was as
follows:—
   “It appears from these results that the diurnal law of mean
disturbance is not constant throughout the year, as has been sup
posed; in fact, the law for the summer is nearly the reverse of
that for winter, while that for autumn is nearly intermediate
between the two" (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol. xix. part 2.
p. xxviii).
             I
    In 1856 communicated the fact to Lieut.-Colonel Sykes and
others, that the law of disturbance near the equator was the        in
verse of the so-called mean law for Europe; that is to say, near
the equator the diurnal law of disturbance throughout the year
resembles on the whole the law for Europe in summer, the maxi
mum occurring about 10 A.M. and the minimum about 10 P.M.
I  have therefore not only given the diurnal law of disturbance
for each season in Europe, but I have also found that this law
varies both with season and latitude.     These results refer to the
mean disturbance without reference to sign. When the sign or
 direction of movement was considered, it was found that the
maximum positive disturbance coincided on the whole with the
minimum negative disturbance. This is not the case near the
equator; the law for both signs is the same.         It is probable,
therefore, that for intermediate latitudes the relation of the law
of signs will vary. We may expect in some intermediate latitude
that the mean disturbance of declination will be equal at 10 A.M.
 and 10 P.M., and that the hour of maximum disturbance of force
 will occur gradually later after noon as we leave the equator and
 approach the poles.
     Monthly laws of disturbance.—I found that the mean depart
 ure of the declination-needle from     itsmonthly mean positions
 at  the corresponding  hours, was greatest two   or three days after
 the moon’s opposition, and was least about the time      of conjunc
 tion (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol. xix. part
                                                  2.
                                                  p.    xx).   I  also
 concluded that the diurnal    range  of the declination-ncedle was
 greatest when the moon was near the equator (Ibid.            p.xix):
 similar laws were found for the components      offorce.
     Annual laws  of disturbance.—The mean departure      of  the de

  climation-needle from the normal position for the corresponding
  hour was found by me to be greatest near the equinoxes, and
  least at the summer and winter solstices (Ibid. p. xxii).          This
  law was published by me in 1846. At that time some investi
  gations had been made to determine the law. M. Kreil and
  General Sabine had found the epoch of maximum disturbance to
  be in winter, and Dr. Lloyd had ascertained it to be in summer.
  General Sabine's result, it is true, was derived from disturbance
  above a certain arbitrary limit, a fact, however, which     I   showed
  could not have affected the general conclusion.          Since then
  General Sabine has verified on the whole my result by his own
  process.                    -
      I may  add here, to complete these laws, that first indicated by
  Dr. Lamont,    namely that the diurnal movement seems to have
  been a maximum in 1838 and 1848, and a minimum in 1843–44,
  or that the amount of the magnetic variation seems to obey a
  decennial law; a result which General Sabine has also found to
  exist in his discussion for the value of disturbance.         -
     It may be seen from the results of the Makerstoun Observa
 tions (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol. xix. part 2. pp. xii, xxxi, xlv),
 that the secular change seems on the whole to obey a similar
 law. This fact I noticed at the time (Ibid. No. 5. p. xii.); but
 as the changes were probably in part due to instrumental causes,
 especially in the first years of the series, I could not offer any
 general conclusion.       An examination by me of observations
 made in other places, however, seems to confirm the results ob
 tained at Makerstoun, which may be stated thus:—
     The secular rate of increase of horizontal force was a maximum
 in 1843–44, and a minimum in 1847–48.
     The secular rate of diminution of the vertical force was a mi
 nimum in 1848.        As 1842 was the first year for which a result
 has been   obtained,  the epoch of maximum is uncertain.
     The rate of yearly change of magnetic declination seemed to
 attain a maximum in 1847–48.
    As already mentioned, the results in the first years (1842–44)
 were probably affected by instrumental errors; but this could
not be the case in the latter years; and this connexion with the
decennial period for three instruments cannot be accidental.
    These results were evidently connected with the increasing
amount of disturbance; and at first sight it might appear that
the variation of the secular change was due to disturbance: thus
the disturbance tends to diminish the value of the horizontal
force, the secular change being a yearly increase of force; the
greater the amount of disturbance, the less the yearly increase
should appear.      This relation, however, does not appear to apply
either to the vertical force or to the declination;     and  I am in

              Mr. J. A. Broun        on Terrestrial Magnetism.           85
duced to conclude that the variations of the secular change are
not due to disturbance, though both apparently, obeying the
 same law, are due to the same cause.             This is the first appear
 ance of a law    affecting  the secular variations.
    I have endeavoured to show that the frequency of the appear
ances   of the aurora borealis obeys the same laws as the amount
of the magnetic disturbance.
   The general connexion betwixt the appearance of the aurora
borealis and magnetic disturbances was known in the time of
Graham, Celsius, and Wargentin.              The fact that the needle was
even disturbed sometimes on the approach of an aurora (that is
to say, when invisible at the place of the needle), is noted by
Mairan as a result obtained by Wargentin (Mairan, p. 450, 2nd
edit.).    It is to M. Arago that we owe a distinct statement, and
a considerable amount of evidence of the fact, that when there is
a magnetic disturbance in Europe, there is generally an aurora
borealis visible in higher latitudes, if not visible at the place
where the needle is disturbed.
    My own observations proved that there was always an irregu
larity in the movement of the needle, even when the aurora was
most feeble; in some cases slight disturbances caused me to
search for the aurora and discover its existence, when otherwise
it would probably never have been remarked. I have noticed
 several times in the Makerstoun Observations a curious phaeno
menon occurring with faint magnetic disturbance, which sud
denly covered the whole sky as with a thin milky veil, that               I
have designated milky aurora.             I never, however, observed a
magnetic disturbance at Makerstoun without finding an aurora
also visible, if the state of the sky was favourable.           The follow
ing are the laws of aurora deduced from my own observations:—
   Diurnal law.—The maximum frequency in the winter months
occurs about 9 or 10 P.M. This fact is as old as the correspond
ing one for magnetic disturbance.
    Monthly law.—As          I   lost no opportunity of searching for
aurorae during the years           I  had the direction of Sir Thomas
Brisbane's    observatory,     I  conceived,  if a monthly law existed, it
might be deduced from my observations.                       I
                                                     Ithink have shown
strong reasons to conclude that the maximum frequency of the
aurora occurs near full moon.             It is curious that this is the
result that Mairan finds should follow from his theory (Mairan,
p. 280).     This is the epoch       I have found for the maximum      dis
turbance also.
   Annual law of variation of frequency of the Aurora Borealis.-
This law, that the maximum frequency occurs at the equinoxes,
has   been attributed      lately to M. Hansteen (Proc. Roy. Soc.
 vol. vii. p. 436).      It was attributed by M. Kaemtz to Mairan.

An examination of                      the first edition               of Mairan’s work induced me
to refuse the credit to that philosopher.         M. Secchi, who has
since examined the same edition as myself (1733), has repeated
Mairan's claim.       A careful perusal of the second edition of
Mairan’s work induces me still to believe that Mairan did not
announce this fact distinctly in his first edition; but in the
supplement to the second edition (1754), Mairan includes the
observations of Celsius (1733), Frobesius (1739), Delisle (1738)
and others,            in all
                     which show this law distinctly.

     I shallnow offer you some remarks on the diurnal variation
of the  magnetic   declination.
    In a paper on this subject, read before the Royal Society of
Edinburgh, May 3, 1847, while showing that the movement of
the needle relative to midnight was of the same character as that
relative to noon, I suggested that the apparent smallness of the
night maximum might be due to the variation being a resultant
of two opposite motions; one, the greatest, having           maximum                   its
near noon and its minimum near midnight; the other, the
smaller, having                its
                        maximum near midnight and its minimum
near noon.      This supposition illustrated   I    the superposition   by
of two curves.
I     have also shown in the Makerstoun Observations for 1844
 (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol. xviii.       354), that    p.  subtract            if        we
the ordinates         of
                   the curve  representing   the diurnal movement                                      of
the needle for the northern hemisphere (employing the curve for
summer        Makerstoun for this purpose) from the curve for the
               at
winter      the same place, the differences will
            at                                        the ordinates          be                        of
a  curve representing the movement        the needle     of
                                                          the southern            in
hemisphere.
    The conclusion drew from this fact was, that the reversal
                               I
of  movement with the sun north and south             the equator ob        of
served between the tropics was also shown         high latitudes; and  in
that the midwinter curve           Makerstoun might

due    tothe superposition      the two opposite curves representing
                                          of
 the movements         high north and south latitudes.

has since then made        similar proposition

                                           superposed   opposed  move

different places      the same time, and
                           at                 the same place  in differ                          at

            Mr.      J.     A. Broun on Terrestrial Magnetism.                                          89
    In both hemispheres the diurnal range varies with the sun’s
declination, being greatest in the northern hemisphere, on the
whole, when the sun is furthest north, at which time it is least
in the southern hemisphere; and least in the northern hemi
sphere when the sun is furthest south, the diurnal range being
then greatest in the southern hemisphere.
    The conclusion that M. Arago, drew from these facts was, that
there must be a line on the earth's surface where in the morning
the needle moves neither to the east nor to the west, that is to
say, remains stationary. This conclusion is evidently too general,
 and so far inaccurate.       The legitimate conclusion would have
been, that if there was a period of the year for which the two
movements were equal in amount in two hemispheres, then there
 should be a line of separation where for that period the needle
would rest stationary.        Even this conclusion assumes not only
that the amounts were       equal,  but that the law of the movements
 was exactly the same with reference to the two poles.             It is not a
 little curious that M. Arago has cited% the “dit avoir observer”
 of M. d’Abbadie, “que la variation diurne de déclinaison a
 complétement changé à Fernambuco du moment                            soleil        oil   le           a

 from the St. Helena observations               proof     as      inaccuracy.

 There can      be   doubt that the statement           M. d’Abbadie gives
                                                                      of

 no evidence         line     no movement.                                have
 disproved M. Arago’s supposition. The movement,                          con          it
 cluded,      inverted; but       does not pass from one form               the                   to

 transfer  of  the epochs about the period                       of
                                                     the equinoxes.
 I      think that the only conclusion that could have been deduced
 from the facts long known           the true one; namely, that for
                                               is                                                       a

 therefore, instead          of

in high north latitudes in December; as we proceed south, it
it will be found, when we approach the tropics, that December
is no longer the month of minimum, but the months of Novem
ber and January or February; further south, near the magnetic
equator, March and October are the months of least diurnal
range; still further south, near the tropic of Capricorn, April or
May, and September or August; and finally, June and July in
high south latitudes. This curious shift of the epoch of mini
 mum has been hitherto unknown.
   The months of maximum oscillation are before and after the
summer solstice in high north latitudes; before and after the
winter solstice in high south latitudes; and in August and                                                 Ja
nuary near the magnetic equator at Trevandrum.
   The amount of the daily range therefore has no relation to
temperature, as indeed                        I
                             have already shown from the observa
tions at Makerstoun alone.
   According, then, to the conclusion that        have shown might           I
be drawn from the facts       previously known,    if    things were                    all
equal for both hemispheres,        might expect for some one posi

and   negative  forces producing  the lateral movements would                                                  be
zero.
              If,
             however, from any cause (such          the unequal and           as
unsymmetrical distribution       magnetism          of
                                                the two hemispheres)    on
the two laws should not        exactly similar,   be
                                                the result should                                              at

              a                             The Trevandrum results
will confirm this supposition. The following are the ranges                                                    of

92                    Mr.          J. A.     Broun on Terrestrial Magnetism.
     I would          also refer to a curious fact with reference to the diurnal
law of variation of total force, which I have never seen noticed,
or indicated as remarkable by any physicist; on the contrary, it
seems to have been so little marked, that Dr. Faraday, in his
paper on atmospheric magnetism, has attempted to explain what
is exactly the reverse of the fact (Phil. Trans. 1851, p. 115).
Whether this is due to the doubt as to the accuracy of the tem
perature correction, or the effects of local influences,     cannot                                    I
say; but as the diurnal variation of temperature for the instru
ment which indicates the variations of intensity in this observa
tory is less than three-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit, there can
be no doubt here as to the fact that the total intensity is a maxi
mum near 11 A.M., the time when it is a minimum in high lati
tudes. The fact is shown in                                   all

this observatory.
   Of course the epoch           maximum intensity varies

   Annual law                      of
                       Force.—You are aware that           have deduced                I
from the Makerstoun         Observations,      early      1845,  that the
                                                                     as                as
horizontal force was       maximum near the solstices, and
                                          a                         mini                                a

mum near the equinoxes.          This law was obtained from each
several successive years' observations, and          confirmed               I                        it        by

            Mr.   J. A.  Broun on Terrestrial Magnetism.           93
examination of the observations at Munich and Toronto.            An
other period obtained by General Sabine         I showed was due to
error in the     temperature    coefficient (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb.
vol. xvi.  p.  102).
   To this result I have now to add, that the relative changes of
mean horizontal force are the same over the globe, and the
changes from day to day of the mean horizontal force at differ
ent places on the earth's surface are nearly equal, the unit in
each case being the whole value of the horizontal force at the
place. In other words, the changes of mean horizontal force,
from day to day, are in the same direction over the globe, and
are proportional to the horizontal forces at the places; the differ
ent effect of disturbance, due to its diurnal period, and the
different directions of the secular change, being allowed for.
   The preceding and other facts, which         I shall shortly endea
vour to   prove   in detailed memoirs, have led me to consider anew
the different hypotheses offered to explain the magnetic varia
tions.    I   had already satisfied myself, from the Makerstoun
Observations, that the theories depending on temperature were
wholly insufficient.      I  showed that the areas of the declination
curves did not follow the law of temperature, as supposed by
some physicists.       I also showed that such areas were not the
proper elements in comparison for such a purpose. If any areas
were employed, it should be the areas of the curve described by
the needle freely suspended in the direction of the magnetic force.
   The results      I have now given prove, it appears to me, the
insufficiency of any theory that attempts to relate the amount of
the diurnal movement to the temperature of the place.           March
is with us here nearly the hottest month of the year, whereas
August is about the coolest; yet the former is the month of
the minimum, and the latter the month of maximum diurnal
movement of the declination-magnet.
   None of the facts previously known seem to have been suffi
ciently conclusive on this point, since Dr. Faraday has proposed
a new theory which depends on the temperature of the sum,
acting on our magnetic atmosphere. There can be no difference
of opinion as to the great ingenuity displayed by Dr. Faraday
in his attempts to make his theory explain the results of obser
vations. No doubt many of his applications are not very clear
to me; thus he explains the different motions of the dipping
needle at St. Helena and Hobarton by the statement, “that as
the region is located above in the air, it is above the angle which
the dip makes with the horizon at St. Helena, and therefore ought
to depress the line of force and lessen the dip. At Hobarton,
the region being in the tropical parts, is within the angle formed
by the line of dip with the horizon, and therefore deflects the

94                    Mr.    J. A.     Broun on Terrestrial Magnetism.
lines of force upwards and increases the dip” (Phil, Trans.
p. 112, 1851).
   According to Dr. Faraday's hypothesis, then, the variation of
dip should be zero where the dip is zero. The law of diurnal
variation ought to be opposite on opposite sides of the magnetic
equator, and different on the north side of the magnetic equa
tor, within the tropics, from that where the dip equals that at
Hobarton (at Makerstoun, for example) and “the region is
within the angle formed by the line of dip with the horizon.”
Now none of these conclusions are true.
   There ought also to be some test in this place.             Let us take
the month of March for instance. The sun is              nearly     vertical;
there has scarcely been a cloud seen since December; the tem
perature is near                 its
                       maximum; the soil          red, and heated gusts     is

but it appeared to him that the coincidence then remarked had
not always existed.
   Having found that the magnetic disturbance was greatest not
only when the sun was on the equator, but also when the moon
was on the equator, I was induced to compare the times when
the lines of the moon’s nodes and of the apsides would nearly
agree with each other, and the position of the sun at the equi
noxes.      I
          found that the longitude of the moon’s ascending node
was 0° in 1838 and 1857, while it was 180° in 1848; and that
the moon was in perigee when       longitude was      its
                                                       the same                       0°   in
years, which were those                   of
                                    maximum disturbance. The times                                         of
revolution        of   the nodes and perigee are well known     about                      to    be
 19   and   9    years respectively.
  If   the coincidence               of

 spots, and therefore probably other planets, which would intro
 duce other periods.     Jupiter, whose revolution occupies about
twelve years, was      longitudes
                               in     about 180°     of

   The preceding facts and queries were addressed to you two
months before this date; the letter was then shown to different
persons, and among others to Lieut.-General Cullen the British
resident here, with whom you are no doubt acquainted as a
zealous inquirer in geology and terrestrial physics for the last
half century in India. I had also communicated my results and
the greater part of my guesses to that gentleman before.
                                 am, my dear Sir,       I
                                      Yours very truly,
                                          John ALLAN BROUN.
        P.S.—Since this letter was written        in the Biblio    I have    seen
thèque Universelle de Genève, July 1857, a translation of a me
moir by M. Secchi on the periodic variations of terrestrial mag
netism. This is a continuation of a former paper translated in
                                          jº
the Philosophical Magazine for November 1854 and June 1855,
and      it   draws from me a correction and a few remarks.
        In
       his second paper, M. Secchi offers some laws of the move
ments of a needle freely suspended in the direction of dip.
These movements were                    by me first,     believe, from       I                     all
the three    magnetic   instruments,      and exhibited         the British         to
Association       1846; the curves produced

                                    of
chi has consulted; yet          says, “Mr. Broun has given analogous
                                          he
curves for Makerstoun, and          glance      these will show the same

law, though somewhat more complicated from having grouped
too many months together, and from the higher latitude and fre
 quent disturbances.” M. Secchi has examined plate instead                               8         of
plate        7,

  X. Note          on the Sun's Spots.                 By DANIEL WAUGHAN, Esq.”
         my       published in the May Number of the Philoso
IN phicalarticle
           Magazine,    I endeavoured to show that the heating
and  illuminating  action of suns, if maintained by the aetherial
contents of space, can fluctuate only through the influence of
surrounding worlds. But, though         offered an explanation of  I
the periodicity  of the solar spots,                          I
                                      deem it advisable to point
out the precise manner in which they may arise from the causes
to which I have ascribed them, and thus to furnish a more satis
factory basis for the tests of observation.
    It appears, as a legitimate deduction from my theory on solar
light, that the dark spots must be deficient in number, or entirely
absent, when the sun is advancing into the realms of more dense
aether; and that they must be most numerous and extensive
when he is departing from these localities and entering a more
 rarefied aetherial fluid.      In the first case, his permanent atmo
sphere, which takes no part in the emission of light, must be
heated most intensely in                 its
                                     uppermost strata, and thus brought
into     a state      the greatest security from disturbances.

 incombustible gases, the elevated temperature previously trans

XI.     On the Development of Electricity between Metals and Heated
                    Salts.  By W. G. HANKEL*.
        LTHOUGH it      occurred to Schweigger, soon after the dis
         covery of his multiplier, to bring salts in the fused state,
instead of their aqueous solutions, between two dissimilar metals
in the voltaic circuit, yet Andrews in Belfast was the first (in
1837) to apply Faraday’s discovery of the high conductive power
of certain salts in the melted state to the solution of the question
whether electricity is developed when two metals of the same
chemical nature, but of dissimilar temperatures, are brought into
contact with the same fused salt, in a manner similar to that in
which the thermo-electrical currents of Seebeck are formed.
Andrews found that, under the circumstances described, a cur
rent was formed, proceeding from the hotter to the colder metal,
passing through the melted mass of the salt. He was, however,
unable to determine the law for the direction of the stream when
the salt was only heated so far as to enable it to conduct the
electricity, but not sufficiently to bring it into a state of fusion.
    The interest attached to these electrical phaenomena appeared
to me to render a re-examination of the matter necessary.         The
following paper, which                I
                               have the honour to lay before the
 Königliche Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften as the third in the
 series of my electrical investigations, contains the results of my
 experiments with numerous salts concerning the development of
 electrical currents under the conditions described.
    The paper is divided into two parts, the first of which contains
 the general results derived from the facts observed; the second
 contains these facts in a condensed form, and thus serves in a
 manner as an appendix to the first part.
    I shall in the first place describe, for the sake of perspicuity,
 the process which          I
                        have made use of in my investigations, and
then consider    shortly the general results which have been derived
from them.
    The salt under examination was brought into a moderately
 sized platinum crucible supported on platinum wire, and fused
 by means of a spirit-lamp with double draught, the draught
being, when necessary, increased by the use of the bellows. An
 isolated platinum, gold, or silver wire was introduced from above,
 penetrating to the required depth into the saline mass. When
 electrical currents had to be observed, the crucible was brought,
 by means of      its
                   wire support, into connexion with one end-wire
ofa   multiplier, the platinum wire       the salt being

electrical tension had to be measured, either the crucible (its
support being isolated) or the internal wire was connected either
with the gold-leaf of the electrometer (see part 1 of my electrical
investigations, vol. v. of the Abhandlungen der Königlichen Ge
sellschaft Sachsens, where the electrometer is denoted by A), or
with one plate of a condenser, the wire or the crucible being
respectively in connexion with the earth. For the sake of brevity,
 Ishall call a current proceeding from the crucible to the wire
an ascending current, one from the wire to the crucible a de
scending one.
        If
      the melted mass of the salt be allowed to cool after the
wire has been introduced, and be then heated again, at the com
mencement of the heating an ascending current is formed in the
solid salt, if it conduct at all: the current passes from the hotter
to the cooler metal.
   As soon as the salt in contact with the sides of the crucible
begins to melt, cause is given for a descending current; at the
same time, however, the temperature of the wire is generally
superior to that of the wire in the still solid mass of the salt.
The direction in which the needle of the galvanometer is deflected
in consequence of the two electrical forces, which act in exactly

                        an       descending current, depends upon

the formulae of these bodies being, according to Gerhardt, in
their free state O.S0° and H2O.    Combined, they become simply
SH2O4.
    The same remark applies in like manner to carbonic acid. In
these instances the wonted consequence of Gerhardt is missed.
The fact of the density of the vapour of these bodies being the
same in the free as in the combined states, may have prevented
him from doubling the formulae of these anhydrous acids.        The
types of this theory being essentially types of double decomposi
 tion, this instance of simple combination diminishes somewhat
 the value of the otherwise great logical merit of this system.
    Having taken notice of such exceptions, the empirical truth
 of the theory may be otherwise admitted.
    The philosophical test demands that a theory be competent
 to explain the greatest number of facts in the simplest possible
Imanner.
    In applying this test, three aspects of it require to be taken
into consideration:-
    1. As to the extension of the theory.
    2. The explanation it affords of the facts.
    3. The manner of this explanation.
     As to the first: this theory indeed brings every chemical com
binate under a certain comparative point of view with every
 other. Herein apparently is                        its
                                      merit. Nevertheless, should our
          applied

                           full extent,     will                        be

                 is of
     Why         it
                  that Gerhardt's theory        signally fails     so

often pursued.         In mathematics the starting-point is not gene
ralizations, but axioms, ultimate principles.                 In metaphysics
Descartes led the way of progress by analysing till he thought
he could reach some ultimate elements beyond which it was im
possible for him to go, then studying their force and power, and
proceeding synthetically. The recognition of this method wrought
                                                                         -
the regeneration of science and philosophy.
    On the other hand, look where Gerhardt’s generalization of
Williamson's generalization leads him, and legitimately too, ra
fact which his logical spirit clearly discerned. He is led not to
explain bodies according to their composition and inherent pro
perties, but to think it necessary to restrict chemical science to
the arrangement of bodies according to their decomposition, and
to deny the possibility of our comprehending their molecular
constitution.       Can such a view tend to the advancement of
science? Would it not be only rational, in accepting this veto,
to renounce chemical research altogether?
    These reflections naturally lead to the inquiry after another
theory more adequate to satisfy the just demands which can be
 made upon        it.  There      one which,
                                    is                    still supported

   Nor is the doctrine of bodies being “conjugated by addition”
a whit in advance of that which I have just been considering.
This doctrine adopts the simple expedient of dividing certain
combinates, if possible, into two imaginary parts, of which one
or both are bodies already known. Then it tells us that these
two parts are found united in this body. But how they are
united, or what force binds them together, it does not                                                         in

   Respecting these acids, it may perhaps be allowable to suggest
the possibility of the molecule having two poles, and that espe
cially the atom of oxygen situated at one or perhaps both, and
near to two atoms of oxygen bound together, and forming no
secondary combinate, may be in a state presenting great affi
nity      for
          basic oxygen. Analogy with the electric poles may
perhaps demand the opinion that                         all

was led to the discovery of this surprising and unique law by a
statement of a friend, not since verified, and which, for aught that
has yet been shown, may or may not be true, that the number 5
could be divided into two rational cubes: assuming this to be
the fact, it necessitated (by virtue of my investigations) the coin
cidence to a factor près of two functions obtained by apparently
independent algebraical processes, which coincidence by actual
comparison of the functions     found to obtain. I
   With reference to the connexion of this theory of derivation
with the arithmetic of equations of the third degree between
three variables with integer coefficients, it is after this kind.
Fermat has taught us that a certain class of such equations, viz.
the equation a”--y” + 2*=0, is absolutely insoluble in integers
(abstraction made of the trivial solutions of the type a = 0,
y+2=0). I have greatly multiplied the classes of such known
insoluble equations, as may be seen by a communication from
me to Tortolini’s Annali in 1856.            But over and above such
equations I have ascertained the existence of a large class of
equations, soluble, or possibly                            so,

   2. The first two tubes, which M. Geissler prepared according
to direction, contained mercury and atmospheric air in the
highest possible state of rarefaction. At my suggestion, re
sulting from former trials, instead of air, the vapour of an aethe
rial oil, hydrogen, and phosphorus were employed, and the tubes
were widened at one part.           The mercury also was removed from
the tubes, but their evacuation was still performed by                 means.                    its

shape, and in some of them with the greatest distinctness.        I
might say that an entirely new notion is formed of the character
of this stratification of the light on seeing, in a tube about
2 millims. wide and 400 millims. long, containing traces of
hydrogen gas, about 400 clear spaces, alternating with dark
intervals, with perfect regularity from one end of the tube to
the other, and the dark space which has been before observed
occurring only at the warmth-pole (the negative electrode). In
wider tubes the dark intervals may attain a breadth of 5 millims. ;
they become narrower if the electric light passes from a wider
tube into a narrower one. They often appear only after the
discharge has passed for a long time through the tube, and then
become gradually better and better defined.       In most cases the
illuminating portions perform small oscillations; and when this
is the case, they give the impression of a spiral motion. They
are often, especially towards the negative pole, completely sta
tionary, and appear then as solid immoveable discs.        In many
cases, especially in wide tubes, these discs assume a strongly
conoidal form, the convexity of which is invariably turned to
the warmth-pole, thus corresponding to the direction of the
 electrical discharge.     On inverting the poles, the conoidal
 points, in accordance with the above, assume an opposite        di
 rection.
     6. It may seem at present premature to attempt to explain
 fully the stratification of the light produced by the electric dis
 charge, for such might perhaps embrace the explanation of the
 physical process which takes place on such discharge. So much,
 however, we may already consider as decided, that it is impos
 sible for the discharge through Geissler's tubes to consist of the
 passage    of a luminous appearance, or illuminating substance,
 from one end of the tube to the other; nor does such an expla
 nation derive support from the fact that the discharges of light
 take place at intervals, which, if Ruhmkorff's apparatus be em
 ployed, depend upon the rapidity with which the breakings of
 the current follow one another. The phaenomena can only con
 sist in an aggregation of matter at definite parts of the tube
 which become luminous through the discharge, while the pass
 age of the electricity from one luminous place to the other is
 dark. The aggregation of the matter which becomes luminous
 at these definite places in the tube is a consequence of the dis
 charge itself, and often requires a long-continued series of dis
 charges.
     7. In the neighbourhood of the warmth-pole, towards which
 the electricity passes, no aggregation of matter rendered lumi
 nous by the discharge occurs; but at this place there is inva
  riably a dark space, which in the wider kinds of tubes often

attains a length of                           80  millims. This dark space separates
sharply the stratified                        light we have been hitherto considering,
from the light which      appears about the negative electrode (the

In    two cases the electrical        light-currents    were attracted,      the         in

 flames proceeded, which sunk down                     the ellipsoid, and ex

 metic current      (fig.  4),  the   phaenomenon       underwent        graduala
 alteration.      On entering the ellipsoid the         light became concen
 trated into    a  luminous arch, which traversed the upper part                                 of

 124            Prof. Plücker on the Action of the Magnet
     12. When the tube was slipped along parallel to itself, so that
  the ellipsoid moved in an axial direction from the point of maxi
 mum action above the approximated armatures towards either
 one side or the other, the plane in which the attraction or re
 pulsion of the electrical light-stream occurred no longer remained
 vertical, but became more and more inclined, its inclination
 being always determined by the relative positions of the axis of
 the tube and the place of greatest action.
    13. A perfectly similarly-shaped tube, containing a small
 quantity of hydrogen instead of the trace of phosphorus, showed
 exactly the same appearances, with the single exception that the
 light, instead of being red, was bright violet.
    14. When these same two tubes were so placed upon the
 armatures that the electrical current passed through them in an
 awial direction, the light-streams which entered the ellipsoid
 from both sides underwent horizontal aberrations in opposite
 directions. The stream proceeding from the light-pole termi
 nated as before in a brightly luminous point, which coincided
 in position with one of the two extremities of the horizontal
 equatorial diameters of the ellipsoid.        The light-stream enter
 ing the ellipsoid from the warmth-pole was driven towards and
 concentrated at the opposite side of the bulb, whence continually
 undulating flames were directed towards the side of the luminous
 point.    This appearance was especially beautiful when, instead
 of the bulb-tubes described, simple cylindrical tubes of greater
 width were taken (270 millims. long and 18 millims. wide). The
 undulating flames extended then for a distance greater than
 10 centims.
    Both on reversing the electric current and on inverting the
 magnetic polarity, the phaenomenon underwent simple inversion
 more quickly in the first case than in the second, the luminous
 point and the undulating light changing places.
    15. In the phaenomena just described, the direction of the
 horizontal aberration of the light-stream is determined as in the
 case of the moveable conducting wire.          From the consideration
 of the same case, the breaking of the light-stream above the
 point of greatest action might have been predicted. In the pre
viously described phaenomenon, however, where the light-stream
 throughout byits  whole length     only attracted, such             of
                                                               rupture

                     well mention here       an

two which were observed       in  connexion with the action of the
           upon the electrical light-discharge through Geissler's
tubes.
    When the light       insuch tubes, especially           at
                                                          their widened
portions,  is  diffused, showing    notrace   ofstratification, the dark

         upon the Electrical Discharge      in Rarefied Gases.                   125
intervals are very often brought into existence by the magnet,
whose attractive or repulsive power concentrates the diffused
light.   I imagine that this concentration of the light-stream
must be considered as the cause why the beautiful blue light in
a tube containing sulphurous acid, which had remained quite
unchanged during a long-continued succession of discharges
from Ruhmkorff’s apparatus, on placing the tube upon the
magnet, was in a very short time converted into a washed-out
 green, a colour corresponding to that produced by oxygen
i.
gas.   It seems to me as yet improbable that the magnet should
       a direct influence upon the decomposition which takes
  806.
    17. A tube containing bromine, 200 millims. long and 10
millims. wide, terminated at both ends with bulbs, gave rise to
reddish and violet flashes, which, forming a pencil, continually
traversed the axis of the tube from one end to the other, being
surrounded by a diffuse green light. On placing the tube
equatorially upon the magnet, the flashes were, when the cur
rent passed in one direction, drawn down so that they traversed
the lower part of the tube without rupture. They underwent,
however, thereby a change of colour, becoming bright bluish
green, while a red mist appeared in the upper part of the tube.
    18. In another case, a short tube, terminating in a wider
bulb, was laid upon the approximated armatures. Before the
magnet was excited, the light on entering the bulb, which rested
 sideways on the two armatures, was dispersed in             all
                                                              directions:
after the magnet was excited the bulb was traversed                  green by
and reddish flashes.

 millims.    The platinum electrodes extend into the bulbs              far     as
 as  their centres.    Upon the electro-magnet two armatures were
 placed, whose section was       asquare having   a  side  of       70
                                                                  millims.
 The edges    of the two armatures which were turned towards one
 another were rounded off, and        inthe middle    of  each      obtuse an

196            Prof. Plücker on the Action of the Magnet
conoidal pole-point was screwed in. That bulb of the tubé
which contained the warmth-pole was then so disposed upon
the conoidal poles, that the tube passing between these points
was situated in a horizontally equatorial position.    Previous to
the excitation of the magnet, diffuse violet light was spread
through the bulb, surrounded by a pale green light, which ap
peared to form a thin coating immediately upon the surface of
the glass bulb. After the magnet was excited, the diffuse violet
light collected to a horizontal, semilune-shaped, bright and
uniformly luminous disc, bounded towards the tube by an
almost circular well-defined concave arch, whose middle passed
through the point of the platinum electrode.        This disc was
upon the opposite side enveloped by a narrow strip of beautiful
bright green light, which followed the curvature of the glass.
Moreover, the light (according to what has been already de
scribed), which was red at a distance from the pole, but became
bright violet towards the pole, and showed the dark intervals
beautifully, descended towards the bottom of the bulb on
entering it from the tube, and terminated in a point.           On
inverting the polarity of the magnet, the phaenomenon remained
entirely unaltered, the tongue in which the light-stream termi
nated merely passing towards the top instead of the bottom of
the tube—an alteration which we need no longer consider.
   21. On so changing the position of the tube (fig. 6) that,
while still remaining in a horizontally equatorial position, it no
longer passed between the polar points which continued in con
tact with the bulb, the phaenomenon remained unaltered, with
the single exception that the horizontal violet disc, separated
from the glass by a green strip, was bounded towards the tube
by an arch whose convexity was now turned towards the tube,
and whose middle point still coincided with the point of the
platinum electrode.
   22. The two armatures were then moved apart from one
another, just sufficiently to allow the bulb to            between fit   in
them (fig. 7). The tube having the same direction           before,       as
the line joining the pole-points  passed through  the central point
of  the bulb, where also the electrode terminated. On exciting
the magnet, the disc, which was formed               as
                                                 the former cases,

   23. After the excitation of the magnet, the light diffused in
the bulb of the warmth-pole, as it gradually accumulates to a
disc, rotates around the axial line. The direction of this rota
tion is the then direction of the Ampèreian currents in the
excited magnetic poles.    When the magnetism ceases, the light
rotates back again in the opposite direction. This rotatory motion
is stronger on inversion of the poles. The direction of the
Ampèreian currents in the newly-caused magnetic excitation
determines the direction of the rotation: on inversion this
direction is reversed.     In fig. 7 the arrow shows this direction,
N and S       marking   the north and south magnetism of the
armatures.                                                             -
    24. Finally, the tube and bulbs remaining in the position
last described, the armature was removed from one of the two
limbs of the magnet (fig. 8). The horizontal disc of light
remained, as before, bounded by the axial diameter of the bulb;
but the violet light, in the neighbourhood of the remaining pole
point, was more intense, and the bright green strip enveloping
the disc became somewhat broader towards the opposite ex
tremity of the diameter, and diminished in the intensity of                          its
light in     corresponding degree.

 linesof   light which, proceeding from the separate points          the        of

 of the complex path of the magnetic lines of force, if in the first
 series of experiments we make use of the heavy armatures.

meter      at  the wider end was 40 millims.              At this end the
platinum wire intended for the warmth-electrode entered, pene

dark    space,   which extended almost 60 millims. into the interior
of   the tube. Beyond this dark space the dark bands appeared
extending through the whole tube,                  first about       millims.
                                                                     at               3

of   the tube.           the neighbourhood

bands assumed the form                 sphericalofsurfaces,   whose convex
sides were turned towards that pole.            On inverting the current,

not extend as far as the sides of the tube (fig. 11).
   32. On both limbs of the electro-magnet the two heavy
armatures were again placed (fig. 12) with their rounded ends
turned to one another.         In the first instance, the tube was so
placed upon these, in an axial position, that the point of the
platinum wire which still served as the warmth-pole was situated
nearly above the point of maximum action. The diffused light
surrounding the platinum wire became, in consequence of the
magnetic action, concentrated to an arched disc of violet light,
which stood in an axial position upon the two armatures and
was bordered approximately by two concentric circular arcs
whose centre coincided with the middle point between the
higher surfaces of the two armatures. In the inner arc, which
touched the extremity of the platinum wire and formed almost
a semicircle, light was concentrated in the form of a bright
marrow strip, while the remainder of the space, 8 to 9 millims.
broad, between the two concentric arcs was more feebly, though
for the most part uniformly, illuminated.             Towards the end of
the tube alone, beneath the platinum wire, the light increased
in brightness. The wire itself, as is always the case, remained
constantly surrounded by a finely stratified envelope of light.
In this case the feebler illumination is also bordered with perfect
sharpness by the higher arc, which terminates upon the platinum
wire just where it is fused into the bulb.                 A marrow dark
interval separated the light around the warmth-pole from the
remaining light of the tube, which had retained                   its
                                                               stratification.

   The interior one, which continued to pass through the platinum
point and remained a magnetic curve, on gradually slipping the
tube along, became more and more elongated towards the
narrower part of the tube, until, finally, on reaching the upper
portion of the tube, it bounded the light around the warmth
pole.   By this change a remarkable commixture of the light
occurs, and new colours appear when the ring opens and                                                            its

   39. In accordance with the phaenomena described in the
latter part of the preceding paper, we may say that electric
light under the circumstances in point is magneticº.        Inasmuch
as such light, which proceeds from one point of the negative elec
trode in        all
               directions,     drawn together

reappears     precisely the same manner,

                                                                   I

   40. This last hypothesis was most distinctly supported     the                                    by
following experiment:-A tube was taken which,         before, had                          as
a bulb fused             on
                     one end.  The negative platinum electrode
                              to
was introduced into the bulb,               form oneso   as   to
                                                         its diameters                of
perpendicular       the axis
                         to                   of
                                 the tube. The two ends       this elec                         of
trode, which was thus fused into the glass           two places, were        in
connected together outside the bulb.        The bulb was placed upon
the approximated armatures          such           in
                                            manner that the tube was

                                         as
the tube, light emanated from every point                the electrode            of
through the bulb, and this light collected             curved surface,       to   a

consisted      the illuminated magnetic curves passing through
                 of
the separate points       the electrode. This surface remained per
                                   of
fectly firm and immoveable when the bulb with the tube was
turned      any extent around the platinum wire, which formed
               to                                                                                          a
horizontal diameter       the bulb.of    also remained unaltered even
                                                         It
when the tube (and therewith the         path                       of
                                                 electrical discharge)

                                        to                horizontally,               or
and      the latter position the tube might reach above the one
         in                                                                                                or
other armature, away from the place              maximum magnetic  of
action, without altering this surface.
    *These phaenomena appear most beautifully                            in       the wide cylindrical
tubes lately made             by
                   M. Geissler.

                upon the Electrical Discharge      in Rarefied Gases.                 133
   In the same manner, the bulb, when placed upon the point of
greatest magnetic action in such a manner that the platinum elec
trode was horizontal and avial, might be turned round in the
 equatorial plane without the disc of light thus formed under
 going any alteration at all.
   41. On making use of the tube before employed, provided
 with a bulb in the centre of which the negative electrode termi
nated, whose whole length, with the exception of the extremity,
 was isolated with glass, the corresponding luminous magnetic
curve passing through the end of the wire remained always the
same, in whichever direction the bulb with its tube was turned
around its centre.
   42. In order to discover magnetic light, in the above-de
scribed meaning of the term, experiments were in the first place
made with ordinary frictional electricity.       The positively charged
conductor of an electrical    machine,   terminating    in a sphere, was
placed above the great electro-magnet in such a manner that the
sphere was at a distance of from 20 to 22 centimetres from                             it.
“Brush” discharges were effected from the sphere, which passed
to  the edges      the armatures, whose rounded ends were ap
                      of
proximated          to
                 one another and covered with caoutchouc.             On
exciting the electro-magnet, the brush-discharges remained un
altered. In the same manner have not been successful
                                     I                             disco       in

M. Riess calls (Glimmlicht), which appears the negative pole.

                                                                       as on

                                          the machine          was being  it

appeared continuous         the eye, and the same, only somewhat

134     On the Action   of the Magnet    upon the Electrical Discharge.
    45. On discharging Ruhmkorff's apparatus through Geissler's
tubes, the two electrodes are most certainly distinguished from
one another by their simple appearance.               The platinum elec
 trode at one end of the tube glows; at the other, brightly                   -
 luminous points appear upon the wire.
    The glowing platinum wire is covered with a finely stratified
 luminous envelope, around which is formed the magnetic atmo
 sphere of light bordered by a dark space.
   If   we attempt to bring the above experiments in accordance
 with statical electricity, we must assume that the electrode at
 which warmth is chiefly manifested is the negative electrode, in
 direct contradiction to the hypothesis universally received since
 the experiments of Neeff, that warmth is most abundantly ma
 mifested at the positive and primary (primares), light at the nega
 tive electrode: in contradiction also to many experiments with
 the battery; for instance, to the observation given in a note at
 the end of the first part of this paper, concerning the fusion to
 a sphere of a platinum wire serving as positive electrode in con
 tact with mercury.
    46. Misled for a moment by such contradictions (M. De la
 Rive also adduces such contradictions),          I  yet soon completely
 satisfied  myself   that in our    experiments     that electrode which
 glows, and at which the magnetic atmosphere of light appears, is
 really the negative one.      For, first, on repeating Neeff’s experi
 ments under the        microscope,   with the weakened current of
 Ruhmkorff’s apparatus, light and warmth appeared exactly as
 on the discharge through Geissler's tubes, that is just in the
 reverse way to that given by Neeff.           Still the phaenomenon is
 very variable with different degrees of weakness of the current,
 so that the phaenomenon of Neeff appears to be a complex one.
 Secondly, on referring to the construction of Ruhmkorff’s appa
 ratus, in which the induced current in the thin wire which is
 alone employed in our experiments agrees with the direction of
 the inducing current, it follows that the discharge-current passes
 through the tube towards the warmth-electrode.                Thirdly, the
electrometer     proves  the  presence    of free   electricity during the
 discharge as well as at other times, at the end of the induced
 current wire (most strongly at the outer end of the wire). This
 free electricity is negative at the warmth-pole where the luminous
atmosphere is situated, in agreement with the experiments which
were performed with frictional electricity.           In the fourth place,
the aberrations of the discharge-current in Geissler’s tubes, de
scribed in the first part of this paper,      correspond with the hypo
                                            all
thesis that this current passes towards the warmth-pole, where          is
formed the atmosphere      of  light.  In  order  to   prove this directly,
instead  of  the discharge-current    passing   through a     Geissler tube

laid horizontally upon one of the free polar surfaces of the great
electro-magnet, we may bring a narrow column of a conducting
liquid upon the same surface. Such a column breaks, by being

ments into           its
                 ends.     Such breaking occurs          exactly the same          in
direction       as
               the former      discharge-current,    when the warmth
pole, with the magnetic light-atmosphere, corresponds                    the                              to

            loses water, and   converted    is                     in   great part into acetamide.

perature solidifies in the condenser: above 190° C. the distillate
consists almost entirely of pure acetamide.         Kündig found the
boiling-point to be 222°C., which agrees with that found by
Dumas, Malaguti, and Leblanc.
    The largest yield of acetamide is obtained when dry ammo
niacal gas is passed for some hours through glacial acetic acid,
which is at first kept cool, but can afterwards be heated to inci
pient ebullition.     On subsequent distillation, above one-fourth
of the  glacial  acid is obtained as acetamide.
    Strecker has investigated some of the compounds and decom
positions of acetamideº.        He shows that this body, which is uni
versally considered to be a neutral amide, has the property, like
glycocoll, aniline and leucine, and like benzamide, the type of
a neutral amide, of forming definite combinations with acids.
Their preparation is very difficult from their ready solubility,
and from the ease with which acetamide decomposes into am
monia and acetic acid.
    Hydrochlorate of Acetamide was first obtained by treating acet
amide with oxychloride of phosphorus, but is best prepared by
treating a solution of acetamide in aether-alcohol with hydro
chloric acid gas.       If  care be taken to prevent a rise of tem
perature, by cooling the liquid and merely passing the gas to the
surface, it solidifies to a mass of crystals.        These are washed
with aether, in which they are insoluble, and are then dissolved
in warm alcohol, from which they separate on cooling in long
lance-shaped crystals. They are soluble in alcohol and in water,
but not in aether, are strongly acid, and their alcoholic solution
gives no precipitate with bichloride of platinum.         The crystals
gave on analysis numbers agreeing with the formula
                           2C4H5NO2+ HCl.
    Nitrate of Acetamide.—When acetamide is dissolved in cold
strong nitric acid and the solution exposed to the air in shallow
vessels, colourless crystals are formed which are nitrate of acet
amide.     It has the formula
                         C4  H5NO2 + HO NO3.
    Mercury Acetamide,      C*H*Hg NO”, is formed by adding yel
low oxide of mercury to a solution of acetamide.         The oxide dis
appears at first very easily, but afterwards it is necessary to warm
the solution with excess of oxide.         On evaporating the filtered
 solution in vacuo, colourless crystalline crusts are obtained, which
are readily soluble in water, but sparingly soluble in alcohol.
    Silver Acetamide is formed by adding freshly precipitated oxide
of silver to aqueous solution of acetamide. On filtration and evapo
 ration, crystalline plates of the compound in question are obtained.

         Prof. Strecker on   some Compounds      of Acetamide.        137
   When dry acetamide is heated in a retort in a current of dry
hydrochloric acid gas, there is obtained in the receiver a mixture
of a colourless liquid and a crystallized distillate, while the retort
contains a solid, difficultly-volatile residue.     The liquid distillate
consists of a mixture of chloride of acetyle and of concentrated
acetic acid, together with traces of acetonitrile or cyanide of me
thyle. The crystalline mass was mostly soluble in aether. The
insoluble part consisted of hydrochlorate of acetamide.              The
aetherial solution, on evaporation in vacuo over sulphuric acid,
deposited hard granules; they gave on analysis the composition
C*H*N*O°, and consisted of a mixture in equal equivalents of
acetamide and diacetamide,
             C12H12 N2O6=C4 H5NO2 + C8H1 NO4.
The residue in the retort consisted of sal-ammoniac, and of a sub
stance soluble in alcohol, and separating from its alcoholic solu
tion in colourless columnar crystals. These were separated from
adherent sal-ammoniac by re-solution in absolute alcohol. They
were the hydrochlorate of a new organic base which neutralizes
the strongest acids, and which Strecker names acediamine.            The
aqueous solution of the hydrochlorate gives with chloride of pla
tinum no precipitate, but on evaporating the solution, large, hard,
yellow crystals of a platinum double salt are obtained. This is
soluble in water, but insoluble in a mixture of alcohol and aether.
   It has the formula C*H*N*, HCl, PtCl4. The sulphate ob
tained by digesting the hydrochlorate with sulphate of silver,
crystallizes in colourless pearly plates.        It is easily soluble in
water, and is quite neutral.
   It was found impossible to prepare the base by treating the
sulphate with excess of baryta, as in the free state it decomposes
under assimilation of the clements of water into acetic acid and
ammonia, according to the equation
                C4 H6 N2 +4HO = C4H4O4+2NH3.
   The    decomposition    of acetamide by dry hydrochloric acid
yields diacetamide, acediamine, sal-ammoniac, and acetic acid,
and small quantities of chloride of acetyle and of acetonitrile.
These bodies result from various decompositions, which may be
thus expressed:—
         2(C4 H5NO2)+HC1-C3H7NO.                      4-NH3Cl.

    The amides were divided by Gerhardt and Laurent into six
 classes, all of which are derivable from neutral or acid ammonia
 salts of monobasic or polybasic acids by the loss of water; and
 acediamine would be an amide derivable from a basic ammonia
 salt, inasmuch as by               its
                          decomposition     yields one equivalent       it

effected by Béchampº, has been subjected by Städelert to a care
ful examination, and he has arrived at results entirely differing
from those of Béchamp.       About 50 grims. white of egg (or 6
grims. albumen), diluted with water to 180 grims., were heated to
a temperature of 50° to 55°C. with 1 grm. permanganate of
potash.     The action took place very slowly; and when decolori
zation was complete, the solution no longer gave the reactions
for albumen: an additional quantity of permanganate was added,
and the whole maintained for some time at the previous tempe
rature. The liquid was no longer decolorized; and hence the
oxidation for this temperature was complete.         To decompose
the excess of permanganate, some alcohol was added, the liquid
filtered, neutralized with sulphuric acid, and evaporated to dry
ness, the residue extracted with alcohol, the solution poured off
from the deposit (which consisted of sulphate of potash and a
yellowish syrup), and evaporated to a small volume.             This
residue contained no crystals of urea; but when nitric acid was
added, crystals were formed which had indeed some resemblance
to that substance, but could not be taken for it without further
investigation.
     Ifthese crystals were nitrate of urea, urea could readily be
obtained therefrom : they were dried between blotting-paper and
treated with moist carbonate of baryta, filtered and evaporated,
and the residue extracted with alcohol.     In this solution no urea
      found;   on the  contrary,            all   its
                                         reactions exhibited     the

markable that, by the action of permangamate of potash, a com
paratively considerable quantity of benzoic acid was obtained.
   Béchamp mentions nothing of the occurrence of benzoic acid
in the oxidation products of albumen; and it must hence be
assumed that he has mistaken it for nitrate of urea.      And the
fact that the alcoholic solution of the product  of oxidation gave
a precipitate not only with nitric acid, but also with oxalic acid
and with protonitrate of mercury, would quite agree with this
assumption.

THE“Observations
     following communication was read:—
                  on the Poison of the Upas                                 Antiar.”             By Prof.
Albert Kölliker, of Wurzburg.                                                    .
  During my stay in England,           in the autumn of 1857,        was so                     I
fortunate as to    acquire the rare   poison  of the famous Antiaris toxi
caria (Lesch.), with which no experiments have been tried since the
time of Magendie, Brodie, Horsfield, and Schnell and Emmert (1809–
1815).       I
             owe my specimens of the Antiar poison to my friend Prof.
Christison, of Edinburgh, who had it from Borneo, and to Dr. Hors
field, of London, who collected it himself during his stay at Java in
the beginning of this century; and as both specimens were fully
active—as some preliminary experiments made in company with my
friends Dr. Sharpey and Dr. Allen Thomson showed—I thought
it well worth while to devote some time to the study of the poison,
and to try to elucidate        manner   its action of                 on
                                                       the animal organism.
The   following   are the principal  results which     obtained   Imy expe                 in

if in the state of rigor mortis. All interior organs, especially the
lungs, liver, stomach, intestine, and kidneys, are gorged with blood,
and in a state of great, especially venous, hyperaemia. The blood
is fluid and rather dark, but soon coagulates when exposed to the
air, and assumes a brighter colour. The lymphatic hearts cease to
beat as soon as the reflex movements are lost.                   At the same time
the nerves are yet found excitable, but their power is very low, and
generally vanishes in the second hour after the application of the
poison.      The same must be said of the muscles, which contract
very feebly when directly stimulated by galvanism, and in most
cases lose their power totally in the second or third hour, and gene
rally a little after their nerves. The rigor mortis begins early,
sometimes in the sixth hour, and is generally well established at
the eighteenth hour.

tion of the voluntary and reflex movements in the first and second                                                     -
hour after the introduction of the poison.
   4. The Antiar paralyses in the second place the voluntary
muscles.
  5. In the third place                      it   causes the loss        of excitability of the great
nervous trunks.
   6. The heart and muscles of frogs poisoned with Urari may be
paralysed by Antiar.
   7. From          all
                 this   may    itdeduced, that the Antiar principally
                                                    be
acts upon  the muscular fibre and causes paralysis                                   of   it.
    So much for this time.     My experiments with the Antiar upon
warm-blooded animals have only begun, and          am not yet able            I                                to

pany's ship the ‘Prince of Wales’ for York Fort, where he arrived
on the 16th of August, and after completing the Magnetic Observa
tions which he had been charged to make at that station, proceeded
on the 30th of the same month, by the canoe route, to join Mr.
Palliser, who had quitted England some days before him, and had
taken the route by the United States to Canada and the Red River
Settlement, and thence to Carlton House, where the whole party
would be assembled in the fall.
    The care which Lieut. Blakiston bestowed upon his determinations
at York Fort appears to have been commensurate with the theoreti
cal importance which, before he quitted El:gland, he was aware would
attach to the results.        In submitting these to the Society, I must
solicit a continuance of the patience and indulgence so kindly given
to me on a recent occasion; for the subject of Terrestrial Magnetism
is far less generally understood than I believe it deserves to be;
and there is often an apparent complexity in the details, especially
to those who are not familiar with the subject, which requires time
to be occupied in their elucidation.                       ...I
                                                  shall commence with showing

where  it was nearly 90°; and by graphical delineations, according to
well-known methods, in which all the observations were taken into
the account, it was shown that whilst the dip of 90° could not be in
a more southerly latitude than 70°, the greatest intensity of the
force would      be found somewhere about the 53rd parallel in the
vicinity of Hudson's Bay, not less than 1000 geographical miles
distant from the point of 90° of dip with which it had been supposed
 to coincide.
    The hypothesis, so generally put forward in the elementary trea
tises on Magnetism of that period, was therefore shown to be no
longer tenable. . It was in fact specially one of that class of specula
tions designated by Bacon as “anticipations of nature,” of which
it is so commonly the fate to be swept away, as knowledge advances
by that more slow and gradual, but more philosophical and certain
 “interpretation of nature,” which results from a strictly inductive
 process.                                        -
    Steadily pursuing this last-named process, the Royal Society—after
 provision had been made by the establishment of Colonial Magnetic
 Observatories for a systematic examination of the phenomena of the
variations of comparatively small amount, which are produced at the
 surface of our planet by the influence of other bodies of our system;
and by the Antarctic Expedition of Sir James Ross, for the magnetic
 survey of such portions of the higher latitudes of the southern hemi
 sphere as are accessible to navigation,-recommended to Her Majesty's
 Government, that in the northern hemisphere a magnetic survey
should be made of those parts of the British possessions which were
 adjacent to the position which observation had indicated as that of the
 principal maximum of the magnetic force in that hemisphere. This
recommendation was carried out in 1843 and 1844, and the particulars
 of the survey, together with the conclusions derived from              form                         it,

mations   in a detached building, appropriated chiefly to a close inves
tigation into the direction and amount of the secular change. The
result is stated in the 3rd volume of the Toronto Observations, p. cxxvi,
and is as follows:—“The secular change of the declination from
 1845 to 1851 inclusive was an annual increase of l'95 of west decli
mation.     From July 1851 to April 1854 (two years and nine months)
an annual increase of 2:54: and assuming the circumstances of a new
series commenced in 1855 with the same instrument placed in a new
building to be strictly comparable with those of the old series, the
increase from    April 1854 to October      1855 is at the mean annual rate
of 3'54.”      The progressively increasing amount of the rate of secu
lar change is   a circumstance which, for obvious reasons, may be ex
pected to follow for a time after the reversal of the direction of the
change.
    Attention being thus alive, particular care was taken that the
azimuth compass with which Lieut. Blakiston was supplied should
be free from instrumental error, and the practice was recommended
 to him of repeating observations at different hours and on different
 days. The following is a transcript of the report received from him
 from York Fort, showing how thoroughly these directions were kept
in   Vlew :—

     It appears therefore that the secular variation which between 1819
  and 1843 caused an increase of east declination, caused on the con
  trary between 1843 and 1857 a decrease of east declimation. This
  is a reversal in the same sense as that which has been seen to have
  taken place at Toronto. It seems probable from an inspection of the
  intervals, and of the differences of declination-value, in the three
  determinations above noticed, that the epoch of reversal must have
  coincided very nearly with that of the survey of 1843–44; and con
  sequently that Lieut.-Col. Lefroy's result inay show approximately
  the maximum which the easterly declination attained at York Fort
  before the change took place.      If   we might assume 1843 to be the
  precise epoch, it is deserving of remark that it is the same year in
  which the observations of the inclination at Toronto show that the
  annual secular variation of that element changed from a decreasing

to an increasing rate.     The dip observed by Lieut. Blakiston at
York Fort was 83°53' in 1857, and by Lieut.-Col. Lefroy 83° 47' 2
in 1843, showing, as at Toronto, a slight increase to have taken place
in that element in the interval.

     am indebted to Dr. Norton Shaw, Secretary of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, for a copy of declinations observed by Mr. Palliser
in his passage between Fort William and the Red River Settlement.
It happens that four of the stations in this route, at which Mr.
Palliser observed the declination in the summer of 1857, had been
stations of Lieut.-Col. Lefroy in 1843–44.     They are as follows:—

should have, according to the hypothesis, a movement of translation
from west to east conformably to the motion of the weaker system,
until the difference in longitude between the poles of the respective
systems should amount to 180°, an event which would constitute an
epoch in the secular magnetic variations, characterized (amongst
other circumstances) by the reversal of the motion of the isogonic
lines in America, which would thenceforward take place from east to
west, as the distance between the poles should diminish on the Sibe
rian side of what Halley termed the American Pole. Now it is well
known that the expedition of MM. Hansteen, Erman, and Due, across
the continents of Europe and Asia in 1828 and 1829, had, for                                                    its

                Mr. Candy      on a Physiological Alphabet.                15]
    The open mouth, affording an uninterrupted, unimpeded passage
to the breath, is represented by two horizontal straight lines (~).
    The sudden, complete, closing of the lips, which gives the sound
          (I);
of the letter P, is represented by drawing a line joining these two on
the left             the mouth looking in the same direction as the
Queen's head on the coins and stamps.
    All the letters in the first column of the Table have a line on the
left, and are therefore labials.
   The second column, having a line inclining to the left, are dentals.
    The third column have a vertical line in the centre of the mouth,
and are the linguals.
   The fourth column incline to the right, and are the palato-linguals
or weakened linguals.
   The fifth column, with a line curving over to the right, are the
Sanscrit cerebrals, in which the tongue is curled up, so that the
lower side of it comes against the roof of the mouth.
   The sixth column, in which the line leans from the right to the
centre, are the palatals.
   The seventh column, with a vertical line on the right, are the gut
turals, at the back of the mouth.
   The eighth column, with a line on the right, leaning to the right,
are the faucals, still further back than the gutturals.
   The first row of letters in the Table, with a thin line from top to
bottom, are the mute explodents, in which there is a sudden and
complete stoppage of the breath.'
   The second row, with a thick line, are the corresponding sonant
explodents.
   The third row, in which there is an interval between the top line
and the connecting line, are the whispered continuants, in which
there is a passage of breath, producing a hissing.
   The fourth row, with a short thick line, are the corresponding
voiced continuants, or buzzes.
   The fifth row contains additional hissing letters, and the sixth
row corresponding additional buzzing ones.
    In the letters of the seventh row, there is represented an opening
upwards at the back of the mouth, leading into the nose. These,
therefore, are the nasal letters.
    The double curl in the eighth and ninth rows indicates a vibration
 of both sides of the tongue, while the tip is fixed. This is the case
in L, which is represented in Sanscrit by a similar form. The eighth
row, with thin lines, are the whispered Ls.                         -
    The tenth and eleventh rows, with a single curl, are the Rs or
trills. The curl indicates vibration.
    The twelfth row are the Caffre clicks.         The shortline darting out
from an   angle,   shows that the   tongue    is placed in a certain position,
and then    suddenly   jerked  away.
    The thirteenth row are the breathings.
    The dots and accents      (‘’’) in the last row are the vowel-points.
    The last  figure  shows the   applicability   of this alphabet to mono

   There are three series of vowels; the upper, middle, and lower;
the points representing which are placed respectively above, between,
and below the two horizontal lines of the letter.
   There are also three positions of vowels; labial and dental (which
may be called front), palatal, and guttural. The points are placed
respectively at the left hand, middle, and right of the letter.
   In some cases there are three vowels of the same series in the
same position.    These are expressed respectively by
                                                    -  . / \ in the ap
propriate place.
   The number of vowels which may be expressed is thus twenty
seven; but there are only twenty distinct vowels recognized, of
which ten occur in English. There are no front upper vowels.
   Each of these twenty vowels may be long or short. The long
vowels may be expressed by doubling, or thickening, the sign for the
      .
short vowel; or perhaps better by combining with it the mark                                                   (-),
giving   -,       Z       or      <           ,    \   or > for the long sounds of (...)                   (?) (v)

  fore to be the base of those rocks which, in the north of England,
  represent the Wenlock and Ludlow groups of Siluria.             5. A coarse
  slate, often much contorted.         6. A bed of impure limestone, which
  may be traced from Tottlebank Fell towards the north-east for about
  two miles, after which it thins out and does not again appear further
  northward.      7. A coarse and often contorted state.         When No. 6
  is  wanting,   No. 5 and No. 7      may   be considered as one group (now
  called Banisdale    Slate),   which is  widely spread, and gradually passes
 into more coarse and gritty        masses, that link themselves to the next
 superior group.        8.  Grit,  slate,  and tilestone, expanded between
  Kendal and     Kirkby    Lonsdale.     This is followed by unconformable
 masses of Old Red Sandstone and carboniferous limestone.              Of the
 above    groups,  Nos.   5, 6, and 7  approximately   represent the Wenlock
 series, and No. 8 abounds in characteristic Ludlow fossils.
      In the range of these groups from Shap Fell to Tottlebank Fell
  (which is about two miles south-west of Coniston Waterfoot) there
 seems to be no ambiguity; but to the south of Tottlebank Fell the
 groups have, through the intervention of great faults, been thrown
 into such abnormal positions that their relations have often been
 misunderstood.       Thus, (in 1822) when the author first attempted
 to   map  this  part  of Lancashire, he was led, by the line of strike as
 well as   by  the whole physical characters of the country, to identify
 the Tottlebank Limestone with a calcareous band a few miles further
 south, which ranges (on the east side of the Duddon estuary) from
 the hills above Bank House, through Meer Beck, towards the vil
 lage of Ireleth, and which from thence by an enormous fault (upcast
 towards the south) is thrown into the ridge of High Haume, near
 Dalton, from which it is continued nearly in the same strike till it is
 covered by the Old Red Sandstone and Mountain Limestone.               This
identification was however erroneous; for the limestone-beds above
mentioned, ranging on the east side of Duddon Sands, are altogether
unconnected with the Tottlebank Limestone, and are in mineral type
and fossils absolutely identical with that portion of the Coniston
Limestone which appears, as is well known, on the other side of
Duddon Sands in the south-western extremity of Cumberland.
     The above mistake (made in like manner by several subsequent
observers) was partially corrected by the author in 1845; when, on
good physical and fossil evidence, he placed the High Haume Lime
stone on the same parallel with that of Coniston.            Not having any
fossils from the limestone quarries north of the village of Ireleth, and
not having found a single characteristic fossil from the slate-rocks
between Ulverston Sands and Duddon Sands, he was in 1845 unable
to carry his correction any farther; but even then he remarked again
and again that the calcareous beds north of the village of Ireleth in
structure resembled the Coniston Limestone, which is seen on the
north-west side of the Duddon, much more nearly than they resem
bled the calcareous beds of Tottlebank.
     In the autumn of 1856 the author, accompanied by his friends
(Mr. Gough of Reston Hall, and Mr. John Ruthven of Kendal), saw
for the first time the excellent local collection formed during the

On Dislocations of Rocks                between   Leven and Duddon Sands.                        157
labours of many past years by Mr. Bolton of Ulverston.                    It was
evident almost at a glance that the fossils he had collected from the
slate-rocks between Ulverston and Duddon Sands belonged to the
upper part of the Coniston group (No. 3).              He kindly pointed out
to them some of his best         localities, and   they  left the country con
vinced that mearly all the older rocks between Ulverston and the
Duddon estuary belonged to the Coniston group, and consequently
that these rocks were not superior, but inferior to the Coniston grits,
though the prevailing dip and the geographical position of the groups
 might seem to indicate the very contrary.
    In 1857 they again visited the district, re-examined Mr. Bolton's
 unrivalled local collection, and again during two days made traverses
 under his guidance.       They then devoted a few days to the approxi
 mate determination of the vast breaks and faults, which have so much
 disturbed the normal position of the physical groups in a part of
 Furness, and made the colours of the Geological Map to appear
 almost incredibly anomalous.
    The author then described, by help of plans and sections, the
faults above alluded to. 1. Black Coomb, protruded as it is at the
 south-west end of Cumberland, seems to have been a kind of centre
 of disturbance.       The chloritic slates and Coniston group which
 skirt the south-east side of Black Coomb have been ripped up by a
 north and south fault which at one cast throws the Coniston lime

ON THE FLUORESCENCE OF A SOLUTION OF FRAXINE WHICH AP
 PEARS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF A YELLOW COLOUR.
 BY THE PRINCE SALM-HORSTMAR.
      ROFESSOR         STOKES has had the goodness to call my atten
       tion to the   probability   of the observation of a yellow fluorescence
of a solution of    fraxine,   in a test-tube placed in a case of blue cobalt
glass (see Poggendorff's Annalen, vol. xcvii. p. 638), being due to
an optical illusion caused by the colour contrast.                This suggestion
induced me to examine the matter more               closely.
   If the experiment be so arranged that the test-tube containing the
solution be placed in a narrow opake case, closed at the bottom, and
having a single opening through which the daylight passes horizon
tally, the blue fluorescence appears precisely as in direct daylight.
In a case of dark violet manganese glass, the solution also presents
the same blue fluorescence as appears in direct daylight.
   Hence it certainly follows that the yellow fluorescence mentioned
above was an optical illusion, caused by the fact that the eye only
recognized one part of the fluorescent light of the fraxine, that                                         is,
only the yellow rays, because the much stronger blue light                       the               of
glass case prevents the eye from recognizing distinctly the feeble
blue rays   of  the total fluorescence.      The yellow rays                      of
                                                                     the fluorescent
light, although inferior          respect

    1.      S in the former memoirt, we shall again find it convenient
               to employ polar coordinates, the attracted point being
    taken as  pole, and to adopt the following as definitions:—
       Corresponding points of two or more surfaces are those which
    lie on the same radius vector.
       Corresponding tangent planes touch their respective surfaces at
    corresponding points, and the normals at these points are corre
    sponding normals.
         If
         we allow ourselves, for the sake of brevity, to make use of
    the term vector-plane for any plane through the radius vector at
    any point, then the plane which contains both the radius vector
    and the normal may be called the normal vector-plane of the
    point under consideration, so that corresponding normal vector
    planes will pass through the same radius vector and contain
                                           -
    corresponding normals.
       Lastly, any cone having         vertex  its the attracted point
                                                                at       pole          or

 the same intensity along the same line, we shall consider, solely,
 the group whose corresponding elements attract equally.        The ex
 pression ‘equally attracting surfaces’ being interpreted in this
 very restricted manner, it will be seen that the problem before
 us reduces itself to a purely geometrical one, which, apart from
 the theory of attraction, is not without interest.

this theorem must be the same for all surfaces and a determinate
direction of the radius vector, will, in general, vary with this
direction; in other words, it will be a function of the two
angles 6, q which determine the same. The theorem leads im
mediately to the solution of the following problem:-To deter
mine the density on a given surface in order that any portion of
the same may attract the pole in the same manner as the corre
sponding portion of any other surface with respect to which the
density is known.   In the present memoir, however, instead of
entering into the details of this problem, we shall occupy our
selves exclusively with the consequences of the first theorem.
   4. A few of the simplest of these consequences may be at once
deduced.     For example, each ray of a pencil is cut twice, at the
same angle, by a sphere; so that the centre of the pencil, if it
be without the sphere, will be attracted in the same manner by
corresponding portions of the convex and concave surfaces; and
if the centre of the pencil be within the sphere, it will be kept in
equilibrium by the attractions of corresponding portions, pro
vided that, in both cases, the densities are the same at corre
sponding points. The well-known theorem given by Newton in
the 70th Prop. of the first book of his ‘Principia, is a particular
case of the above.
   5. Surfaces whose like-directed radii vectores are proportional
to each other, or, as we shall call them, similar surfaces, also at
tract the pole in the same manner when the densities at corre
sponding points are equal. This is at once evident from the
equation (1), which shows that the attraction of an element inter
cepted by a given cone is independent of                         its
                                                 distance from the

   Analogous theorems with respect to inverse curves, of single
and double curvature, might easily be established; to do so,
however, would be to extend too much the present digression.
We return, therefore, to the subject under consideration*.
   8. A sphere around the attracted point as centre is but an
individual of a large class of surfaces which possess peculiar
attracting properties. Any surface of this class may be defined
as cutting every ray of the pencil whose centre is the attracted
point at the same angle 8. The densities at corresponding
points being everywhere assumed to be the same, it is evident
that the class referred to includes innumerable groups of equally
attracting surfaces, each group corresponding to a particular
value of 8.      The sphere belongs to the group determined
by the value            &= #.         The attractions of corresponding portions
of two surfaces      belonging to different groups (8) and (8)
are like-directed and have a constant ratio to each other, that
is to say, a ratio which is independent of the magnitude of the
attracting portions. This is at once evident from the equa
tion (1), which shows that the attractions of corresponding ele
ments are inversely proportional to the sines of the constant
angles 8 and 81. As a particular case, therefore, it follows that
the attraction of a portion of a surface. of the group (8) is to
that of the corresponding portion of the sphere as 1: sin 8.
Hence, as far as attraction is concerned, surfaces of this class
enjoy       all
            the symmetrical properties         spheres.      be
                                                           For example,
if the density       such on surface  a                    by
                                          everywhere the same, any

                                the attracted   point,  will attract this
point along that axis, and        on.        so

systems of cones having the origin for common vertex, and the

we proceed next to examine the mutual properties of any two

and each group includes as many sub-groups of equally attract

general form. The class clearly includes, too,          surfaces                             all                  of

XIX.    Further Observations on the Allotropic Modifications of
    Orygen, and on the Compound Nature of Chlorine, Bromine, &c.
    By Professor SchöNBEIN*.
      MY DEAR FARADAY,
       last six months I          have been rather busily working
Thºse
   on oxygen, and flatter         myself not to have quite in vain
maltreated my favourite; for                   I
                                    think can now prove the cor    I
rectness of that old idea of mine, according to which there are
two kinds or allotropic modifications of active oxygen, standing
to each other in the relation of + to — , i. e. that there is a
positively-active and a negatively-active oxygen, an ozone andan
antozone, which on being brought together neutralize each other
into common or inactive oxygen,                             according to the equation
6) + 6)=O.              -
    The space allotted to a letter being so small,          cannot enter          I
into the details of  my   late  researches,  and must confine myself
to some    general  statements,    which                       I
                                             hope, however, will give
you a clear notion of the nature of my recent doings.            Having
written a paper on the subject, that will before long be published
in the Transactions of the Academy of Munich, shall not fail                      I
to send it to you as soon as possible.
    Ozonized oxygen, as produced from common oxygen by the
electrical spark or phosphorus, is identical with that contained
in a number of oxy-compounds, the principal ones of which are
the oxides of the precious metals, the peroxides of manganese,
lead, cobalt, nickel and bismuth,       permanganic, chromic and va
madic  acids;  and even the    peroxides   of iron and copper may be
numbered    amongst    them.
    The whole of the oxygen of the oxides of the precious metals
exists in the ozonic state, whilst in the rest of the oxy-compounds
named, only part of their oxygen is in that condition.             I call
that oxygen negatively-active, or ozone par eacellence, and give
it the sign 0 on account of                  its
                                    electromotive bearing.      Though
generally disinclined       coin new terms, think
                               to                         convenient

    Now, on bringing together (under proper circumstances) any
ozonide with any gntozomide, reciprocal catalysis results, the 6 of
the one and the 69 of the other neutralizing each other into O,
which, as such, cannot be retained by the substances with which
it had been previously associated in the 0 or 6) condition.    The
proximate cause of the mutual catalysis of so many oxy-com
pounds depends therefore upon the opposite states of the active
oxygen contained in those compounds.
    I will now give you some details on the subject.
    1. Free ozonized oxygen = 0, and perQxide of hydrogen = HO
 +0, or peroxide of barium = BaO + 69 (the latter suspended
in water), gn being shaken together destroy each other, HO +6)
 or BaO +6) being reduced to HO or Ba0, and 69 and 0 trans
formed into O.                                     o
    2. Aqueous permanganic acid = Mn’ O’--50, or a solution
of permanganate of potash mixed with some dilute nitric acid, is
almost instantaneously discoloured by peroxide of hydrogen or
peroxide of barium, the nitrate of the protoxide of manganese
being formed in the first case, and in the second, besides this
salt, the nitrate of baryta. It is hardly necessary to state, that
in both cases the 0 of the permanganic acid and the 69 of the
 peroxides of hydrogen or barium are disengaged as O.
    3. An aqueous solution of chromic acid containing some nitric
 or sulphuric acid and peroxide of hydrogen, are rapidly trans
 formed into the nitrate or sulphate of oxide of chromium, HO,
 and inactive oxygen, which is of course disengaged.     A solution
 of chromic acid mixed with some nitric acid and BaO2 gives
 a similar result, nitrate of baryta and oxide of chromium being
 formed, and O disengaged.
    4. If you add to a mixture of any peroxide salt of iron and
 the red ferro-sesquicyanuret of potassium (both substances dis
 solved in water) some peroxide of hydrogen, prussian blue will
 be thrown down and inactive oxygen set free. On introducing
 into a mixture of nitrate of peroxide of iron and the ferro-ses
 quicyanuret of potassium the peroxide of barium, a similar reac
 tion takes place, prussian blue, nitrate of baryta, &c. being
 formed, and inactive oxygen eliminated. From these facts it
 appears that, under certain conditions, even peroxide of iron and
 HO° or BaO2 are capable of catalyzing each other into Fe0
 and HO, or BaO and O.
    5. Under certain circumstances PbO2 or MnO2 are soluble in
 strong acetic acid, as you may see in one of my papers joined to
 this letter; now if you add to such a solution HO" or BaO2,
 the peroxides will be reduced to HO or BaO, and PbO or MnO,
 inactive oxygen being disengaged.                            o
    6. It is a well known fact that the oxide of silver = Ag0, or

     As you will easily perceive, from these views it would follow
that, under proper circumstances, two opposite peroxides, on
being intimately and in the right proportion mixed together and
acted upon by muriatic acid, could yield neither chlorine nor
peroxide of hydrogen, but mere inactive oxygen. If somewhat
dilute muriatic acid be poured upon an intimate mixture of five
parts of peroxide of barium and two parts of peroxide of man
ganese, the whole will be rapidly transformed into the muriates
of baryta and protoxide of manganese, the active oxygen of both
the peroxides being disengaged in the inactive condition, and
not a trace of free chlorine making            appearance.      its
                                                                The same

  heretical notions, or, to speak more correctly, in my orthodox
  views; for it was Davy who acted the part of a heretic in over
  throwing the old, venerable, true creed.         Indeed the longer                                I
  compare the new and old doctrine on the nature of chlorine, &c.
  with the whole material of chemical facts bearing upon them,
  the less I am able to conceive how Davy could so lightly and
  slightly handle the heavy weight of analogies which, in my
  opinion, speak so very strongly and decisively in favour of Ber
  thollet’s views.    There is no doubt Sir Humphry was a man of
  great genius, and consequently very imaginative; but I am
  almost inclined to believe that, by a certain wantonness, or by
  dint of that transcendent faculty of his mind, he was seduced to
  conjure up a theory intended to be as much out of the way and
  “invraisemblable” as possible, and serve nevertheless certain
 theoretical purposes; and certainly, if he entertained the inten
 tion of solving such a problem, he has wonderfully succeeded.
 But what I still more wonder at is both the sudden and general
 success which that far-fetched and strained hypothesis met with,
 and the tenacity with which the whole chemical world has been
 sticking to it ever since             its

                         Solar Light on Combustion.                                183
before the fireplace, orof closing the shutters of the apartment,
may be traced to the prevalent belief, that the access of sunlight
to the burning materials is unfavourable to the continuance of
the phaenomenon of combustion. Most physical philosophers
very naturally regard this opinion as a mere popular prejudice;
probably originating in the well-known apparent dulling or ob
scuration of flames and of solid bodies in a state of ignition,
which takes place when they are exposed to strong light. The
flame of a jet of burning hydrogen is scarcely visible in the dif
fused light of a clear day; that of an ordinary alcohol lamp is
barely appreciable to the eye when exposed to the direct sun
shine, while a portion of ignited charcoal which glows in the
dark appears to be extinguished when placed in the sunlight.
These familiar phaenomena, attributable to well-established
physico-physiological laws, seem to afford a much more rational
explanation of the origin of the popular opinion, than to suppose
it to be based upon observations relating to the actual rapidity
of burning.
   About thirty-two years ago, Dr. Thomas M'Keever published
a series of experiments in the “Annals of Philosophy#,’ which
seemed to show that there is a real foundation for the popular
impression, and that solar light does actually retard the process
of combustion. So far as I am aware, these remarkable expe
riments have never been repeated.        Leopold Gmelin, in his
 ‘Handbook of    Chemistryt,’  announces Dr. M'Keever’s results
without comment. The important bearing which they appear
to have on the influence of solar light on chemical processes, as
well as on the modern dynamical theory of the mutual convert
ibility of the so-called imponderables, induced me, during the
months of May and June last, to undertake a series of experi
ments with the view of testing the validity of Dr. M'Keever's
conclusions. The subjoined Table will exhibit his results in a
convenient form for future reference :—

     A  sixth experiment, of a similar character, made in a strong
moonlight,      indicated no such diminution in the rate of con
sumption.
     The conclusion to which Dr. M'Keever came was, that solar
light does exercise a positive retarding influence on the process
of combustion. He supposes this effect to be owing to the well
known influence of the solar rays on many chemical processes,
—in some instances accelerating them, but in others retarding
them. Under this point of view, the chemical rays may be sup
 posed to exercise a deoxidizing power, which to some extent
 interferes with the rapid oxidation of the combustible matter.
 In confirmation of this opinion, Dr. M'Keever made an experi
 ment which appears to indicate that a taper burns more rapidly
 in the red than in the violet extremity of the solar spectrum.
     In attempting a repetition of Dr. M'Keever’s experiments,             I
 found it impossible to secure that freedom from agitation in the
 atmosphere, during the exposure of the burning body to the
 influence of sunshine in the open air, which such an investigation
 demanded.         This was his method of conducting the first four
 experiments given in the Table. The powerful influence exer
 cised by comparatively        slight disturbances in the air on the
 rapidity of combustion, renders attention to this circumstance of
 controlling importance. His method of obviating this difficulty
  by the use of lanterns (as indicated in experiment 5) is objec
  tionable, from the impossibility of securing precisely identical
  conditions in relation to the supply of air in the interior. There
  were likewise other considerations which urged me to modify
  his method of conducting the investigation.           It occurred to me
  that, as in his experiments the temperature of the air which sup
  plied oxygen for combustion in the sunshine was about 12°F.
  above that in the darkened room, the rarefaction produced by
  heat might exercise some influence in retarding the rate of burn
 ing in the sunlight.
      In conducting my experiments,        I endeavoured to secure two
  conditions,   viz.-
      1. Absolute calmness in the atmosphere.

   2. Exposure of the flame to the influence of intense solar
light, without heating the surrounding air.
   The first condition was secured by performing      the ex                                         all

dows closed.        To secure the second            condition,       employed              I                           a

sunshine, and  in the other the excess was in favour of the dark;
but the differences are probably within the limits of the experi
mental inaccuracies incident to such delicate investigations.
   These negative results are the more striking from the fact that,
if solar light exercised the decided influence on the process of
combustion which Dr. M'Keever’s experiments seem to indicate,
we should expect the effects to be much more marked and con
spicuous when the light was increased in intensity from eight- to
tenfold by the concentration of a lens. The fact that the rays of
the sun traversed the glass lens before they fell on the flame, can
scarcely be urged as a possible explanation of the discrepancy;
for Dr. M'Keever obtained analogous results when he employed
lanterns. (Wide experiment No. 5.)
   The obvious variation in the rapidity of combustion on differ
ent days (as exhibited in my experiments) illustrates in a most
striking manner the decided influence exercised on the process
by comparatively slight alterations in the external conditions.
This fact should inspire us with wholesome caution, and check
the spirit of rash generalization. Throwing out of consideration
the possible fluctuations in the rate of burning arising from want
of homogeneity in the combustible materials, and imperfections
in the mechanical arrangements by which they are consumed,
there are three external conditions which may be supposed to ex
ercise more or less influence on the rapidity of the process. These
are, 1st, barometric pressure; 2nd, the temperature of the air;
and 3rd, the amount of aqueous vapour present.              I
                                                         propose to
consider each of these separately.
                          1.   Barometric Pressure.
   From a priori considerations, we should be led to expect that
an increase of barometric pressure, through the consequent con
densation of the air, would, cateris paribus, tend to augment the
rapidity of combustion, by furnishing the burning matter with
a greater amount of oxygen in a given volume.      Unfortunately,
direct experiments  are wanting  to test this in as satisfactory a
manner as we should desire.      The older experiments in the
Boylean vacuum, inasmuch as they relate to the degree of rare
faction at which combustion ceased, do not give us information
in regard to the rapidity of the process at the various stages of
exhaustion. The same remark applies to the later experiments of
Grotthuss, as well as to the admirable “Researches” of Sir Hum
phry Davy on the “Effects of Rarefaction, by partly removing
the Pressure of the Atmosphere, upon Flame and Explosion*.”

seq.      Also ‘Works of Sir H. Davy,” edited by Dr. John Davy, vol.     vi.

188               Prof.   J.   Le Conte on the Influence of
The experiments of the latter show that rarefaction produces
striking alterations in the size and character of the flame, but do
not touch the question of the relative rate of burning under
different pressures: they test the comparative combustibility of
different bodies, rather than the rapidity of consumption of a given
body under various degrees of rarefaction.       Nevertheless Davy
informs us that he determined from actual experiment, that the
amount of heat developed in a given time by combustion is slowly
diminished by rarefaction, “the diminution of the cooling power
of the nitrogen being apparently in a higher ratio than the dimi
nution of the heating powers of the burning bodies.”           Speaking
of the   phaenomena     of combustion in condensed      air, he says,“I
ascertained, however, that both the        light and heat of the flames
of the taper, of sulphur, and hydrogen were increased by acting
on them by air condensed four times; but not more than they
would have been by an addition of one-fifth of oxygen.”           Again,
he says, “But by compression, there can be no doubt the heat
of flames from pure supporters and combustible matter may be
greatly increased, probably in the ratio of their compression:”
in the case of air he does not think the effect would be so great.
Inasmuch as the quantity of heat developed in a given time by
the burning of a given substance is known to be a measure of the
amount of matter undergoing oxidation, we are justified in the
inference, that the foregoing results of Sir H. Davy's experi
ments show that the rate of combustion was retarded by the
rarefaction, and accelerated by the condensation of the air.
    The most satisfactory results in relation to the influence of
 condensed air on the process of combustion, are those incidentally
furnished about sixteen years ago by M. Triger, a French civil
engineer, during the operations necessary for working a bed of
eoal lying under the alluvium bordering the river Loire, near
 Languin in the department of Maine-et-Loire.           In traversing an
 overlying stratum of quicksand from 59 to 65% feet thick, he
found it requisite to devise some means of excluding the semi
fluid quicksand and water, which found their way, under every
 arrangement analogous to ordinary cofferdams, in such quantity
 as to defy  all pumping operations intended             keep them dry.

 For this purpose, M. Triger employed large sheet-iron cylinders,

 trivance  fully justified  the  expectations    the engineer; but the
                                                of
 workmen were thus        compelled     to

remarkable effects of condensed air on combustion. Much annoy
ance was at first experienced from the rapid combustion of the
candles, which was only obviated by substituting flax for cotton
threads in the wicks”.    Similar phaenomena were observed a few
years ago by the engineers of the Wilmington and Manchester
Railway, who employed analogous apparatus for securing the
foundations for the piers of the railroad bridge across the Great
Pee Dee river in South Carolina.     So far as have been able to                       I
ascertain, the results manifested   in this case were identical with
those recorded   by M. Triger,   and afford a most striking confirm
ation of the influence of condensed air in accelerating the process
of combustion.
   On the other hand, facts are not wanting to prove that com
bustion is retarded at considerable elevations above the ocean,
where the air is rarefied by diminished pressure.         In a letter
recently communicated to the Royal Society of London, from
J. Mitchell, Esq., Quartermaster of Artillery at Bangalore, India,
“On the Influence of Local Altitude on the Burning of the
Fuses of Shells,” this officer shows that there was a progressive
retardation of the rate of combustion of the fuses at altitudes of
3000, 6500, and 7300 feet, as contrasted with the rapidity of
burning at the Artillery Depôt yard.            This difference Mr.
Mitchell  very rationally  attributes “to the rarity of the atmo
spheric air, and of                          its
                           constituent oxygen,       the higher sta                     at

known, on the difference of temperature between the flame and
that of the surrounding air—must be diminished in a warm
atmosphere, and therefore also tend to retard the rate of com
bustion, cateris paribus, during hot seasons.      But inasmuch as
the variations in the  velocity of the  draught  are proportional to
the square roots of these differences of temperature, it is obvious
that     its
        effects must      insignificant under ordinary fluctuations
                                     be
of atmospheric temperature.       For example, supposing the tem

             the flame         1500°F.,

                                         then the fluctuation    the                                         of
draught between the temperatures           80° and 60°F. would    of                                               be

burning are as the numbers 100 to 127, while the corresponding
densities of the air are as 100 to 121 nearly; in the other cases
the approximation to identity in the ratios is still closer. Would
the variations in the hygrometric state of the atmosphere, which
we have left out of consideration, explain this discrepancy? In
the absence of the experiments necessary for testing this question,
it would be premature to hazard any conjecture.             may remark,             I
 however, that in the case of Mr. Mitchell’s experiments, the cor
 rection for the effects of aqueous vapour would probably in one
point of view operate in the wrong direction, and thus tend to
 increase the discrepancy in the ratios.       For as the temperature
 was   decidedly higher  at the lower   stations,  it is more than pro
 bable that the tension of vapour was greater there than at the
 upper ones, and consequently that              influence      its

XXI.      On the Separation    of Nickel and Cobalt from                   Manganese.
                      By T. H. HENRY, Esq., F.R.S.*
Th;of       methods given by the best authorities for the separation
             nickel and cobalt from manganese are either inconve
 nient or inaccurate. The only method which affords exact
 results is that of Ebelmen, in which the sulphides formed at a
 high temperature are acted upon by dilute hydrochloric acid;
 but it is both tedious and unpleasant to pass sulphuretted hy
 drogen over the oxides contained in a porcelain tray in a porce
 lain tube at a red heat; and the modification suggested by
 Wöhler, of converting the oxides into sulphides by fusing them
 with sulphur and carbonate of soda, still furnishes the sulphide
of nickel in such a state that it is slightly acted upon by very
 dilute hydrochloric acid.
     I have obtained very accurate results by a process differing
altogether from those described, but as simple as any.
    When chloride of ammonium and ammonia are added to a
warm solution of sulphate of manganese or chloride of manga
nese, and afterwards phosphoric acid till the precipitation ceases,
the whole of the manganese is precipitated; and after filtration
no precipitate or even cloudiness is produced by the addition of
sulphide of ammonium to the solution.             The salt formed                     is,
according        Otto, NH4O2MnO, PO*4-2HO, and after igni

198                Mr. C. W. Merrifield on the Geometry of
excess, a white bulky precipitate was produced which rapidly
contracted in volume and became crystalline; after standing
twelve hours it was filtered and washed with a solution of chlo
ride of ammonium and ammonia (the chloride of ammonium is
absolutely necessary).   The precipitate was perfectly white, and
remained so after   ignition, when it weighed 8.67 grs. =4’33

trace of nickel.
   The ammoniacal solution was treated by sulphuretted hy

a little carbonate of ammonia.   It weighed 5-57 grs.

    I probably drove off a little sulphuric acid on igniting the
sulphate of manganese.       I have obtained more accurate results
with the manganese since.
    In operating with cobalt and manganese in the same manner,

             XXII.   On the Geometry of the Elliptic Equation.

IT School,
   is                            Mr. John Riddle (of the Nautical
              now some years since
           Greenwich        Hospital) remarked, that if circles on a
sphere be projected on Mercator’s chart, their projections are
rectified by the elliptic integral
                              |(1—sin”6 sinº)-'dº.
    This observation has led me to a geometrical exhibition of the
elliptic equation
         cos   (bo-cos bicos $24                 sin   #1    sin   b,(1— sin”   6   sin” $)*,
and     at   the same time     of   its  corresponding transcendental equation
                          F(6, bo)=F(6, p.)—F(6, p.),
which seems       me to             be
                            simpler than anything which has yet
                              to
been  given     theonsubject.   My investigation has also presented
me with Lagrange's modular scale,         the mere consequence                                  of

vantage of using a transcendental ordinate; but the only other
that      I
       know, has less simplicity—I mean Dr. Booth’s spherical
parabola, which primarily belongs to the integral of the third

     For the purposes  Mercator’s chart, circles divide themselves

Now log tan              (#4 3)            is the ordinate of the chart.                                The only
constant the equation contains is additive. It is evident, there
fore, that so long as the scale of the chart is unaltered, the
curve does not change either size or direction, but simply shifts
north or south as its extreme latitude alters, or east and west as
we shift         its
             axis.      then                           we

great accuracy, Dumas judged it not unnecessary to make a de
termination of it by a new method.          This consisted in heating
pure granulated silver in a tube in a stream of chlorine, and de
termining the equivalent from the difference between the original
weight of the silver and that of the chloride formed. The tube
was provided with a stopcock by which it could be exhausted, and
a similar tube was used as a counterpoise. Three weighings
were necessary:—1st, that of the exhausted tube; 2nd, of the
exhausted tube containing the silver; 3rd, of the exhausted tube
containing the chloride of silver formed. Various experiments
 were made with different weights of silver. Assuming the equi
 valent of silver at 108, as found by Marignac's very accurate de
 terminations, the result of Dumas's experiments gave 35-5 as
 the equivalent of chlorine, which thus confirms the number
 at present adopted.
    The determination of the equivalent of copper was made partly
 by the reduction of oxide of copper, and partly by converting
 copper into sulphide of copper, but the results were not so con
 cordant as to give any certain datum. The number lies, how
 ever, between 31 and 32.
    These numbers do not agree with Prout’s law; and Dumas
 therefore concludes that that law must be accepted in the less
 general form, that the equivalents of simple bodies are almost                                               all
 multiples         by

ammonia was expelled.      A source of error in previous determi
nations consisted in  using for the reduction vessels of platinum,
with which the tungsten forms an alloy. Glazed porcelain also
favours the formation of an oxide, which combines with the
glaze, and remains unreduced by hydrogen. This was avoided
by using for the reduction tubes and trays of unglazed porcelain.
Another difficulty lies in the readiness with which tungstic acid
is carried away in the aqueous vapour formed by the reduction.
After all the sources of error had been avoided, results were
obtained which gave the number 92 as the equivalent of tung
sten.    Hence the equivalents of molybdenum and tungsten do
not stand in the relation 1:2; but an instance of this relation is
found in the equivalents of oxygen and sulphur, which are as
8: 16. The equivalent of sulphur has also been redetermined
by Dumas, by passing the vapour of perfectly pure sulphur over
pure silver heated to redness, and ascertaining the relation be
tween the weight of the original silver and that of the sulphide
formed. Previous determinations had given the numbers 16:06
and 16-10; Dumas finds that the equivalent is 16.
   As instances of metals which have the same equivalent, Dumas
adduces manganese and chrome, with the equivalents 26.          He
states that he has redetermined the equivalent of manganese by
reducing perfectly pure artificial binoxide of manganese to prot
oxide by means of hydrogen.        His experiments leave no doubt
that the equivalent is 26.
   With many groups of three elements it is the case that the
equivalent of the middle is exactly the arithmetical mean of that
of the extremes.    For instance, sulphur and tellurium have re
spectively the equivalents 16 and 64; the mean of this is 40,
which is very nearly the equivalent of selenium. Similar relations
exist between calcium, strontium, and barium, and between
lithium, sodium, and potassium.         Nevertheless, with certain
triads this is not the case. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine have
the most marked analogies, not only in the physical and chemical
properties of the elements themselves, but also in those of their
compounds.      Yet their equivalent weights stand in the relation
35-5:80:    127; and in order to exhibit the numerical relation, it
would be necessary to raise the atomic weight of bromine to 81,
or to lower that of iodine to 1245.      Dumas has controlled the
equivalents of bromine and of iodine by converting the bromide
and the iodide of silver into the chloride of silver. The iodide
of silver was obtained by converting pure iodine in large crystals
into iodide of zinc, and this into iodide of silver. Bromine free
from iodine was digested for some time with bromide of silver, to
free it from a possible admixture of chlorine, and was then con
verted into bromide of silver.

212                    M. Dumas          on the     Equivalents.
   Assuming 35-5 as the equivalent of chlorine, Dumas found
for bromine exactly the number 80, and for iodine 127, thus
confirming Marignac's numbers.
   Hence the arithmetical relation may be wanting in elements
which belong to the same family, and exhibit the greatest
analogies.
      the fourth part of his paper Dumas considers the question
     In
as to whether the equivalent weights of chemical elements have
any relation corresponding to that which prevails among the
members of homologous series of organic radicals.
   The aether radicals, methyle, aethyle, propyle, butyle, &c.,
                                                             -  have

                                                                     &c.
   The difference between the equivalents of two members of this
series is 14, and their equivalents form an arithmetical series
a +nd, in which the first member a is 15, and the difference d
is 14.
   Many of these exhibit extraordinary relations; and if we did
not know the mode of their formation, we might believe that the
equivalents 57 and 113, 127 and 253, &c. had the simple rela
tion 1:2. And if we did not know whether the equivalent of
an element were 225 or 226, the certain determination of such
a high equivalent would be beyond the means which chemistry
has at    its
            disposal.      capryle, whose equivalent

chemical  family,  we cannot     surprised
                                         be that the equivalents                                 of

chloride of tin, was treated in a long-necked glass globe of the
hardest glass with nitric acid. The residual oxide was then
heated to redness in the flask for an hour.      The experiment was
made with   every   precaution,  and the number was found to be
588; but the oxide was still found to contain traces of water,

   216      M. Pettenkofer   on the Atomic Weights     of the Elements.
      The existence of series tends to show the close connexion be
   tween inorganic and organic chemistry; and the various series
   whose existence has been pointed out have this in common with
   the series of organic chemistry, that the first member conditions
   the chemical character of the succeeding members.             The che
   mical character of   methyle   is seen in the successive radicals; and
   the chemical character of fluorine exhibits itself in chlorine, bro
   mine and iodine; that of oxygen in sulphur, selenium and tel
   lurium; and that of nitrogen in phosphorus, antimony and
   arsenic.
      With the consideration of this subject, and with the determi
   nation of other equivalents, Dumas is still engaged; and these
   speculations will appear more important when he publishes the
   study of a natural family which is derived from hydrogen as the
  first member, and in which the physical properties of the che
  mical elements stand in close connexion with the place which
  each assumes in the series.
     Pettenkofer"     has republished a paper, read by him eight
   º:     ago before the Bavarian Academy of Sciences, in which
    e discusses the relations between the equivalent weights of the
  elements.     The conclusions which he endeavoured to establish
  were, that the equivalents    of the inorganic elements which form
  natural families or groups exhibit among themselves just as con
  stant differences as do the equivalents of compound radicals which
  belong to one natural group.         And simple inorganic elements
  may therefore be considered from the point of view of the com
  pound organic radicals.
     For the full development of his views it was necessary to have
 a  complete    revision of the elements, which at that time Petten
 kofer was unable to undertake.                     -
     Marignac has made a redetermination of the atomic weights
 of barium, strontium, and lead. To previous determinations of
 the atomic weight of barium, in which anhydrous chloride of
 barium was used, the objection had been raised that it was im
 possible to dehydrate crystallized chloride of barium without at
 the same time driving off some chlorine; and in fact it was found
 that chloride of barium, kept for some time at a red heat, does
become slightly alkaline.          Without going into the question
whether chloride of     barium,   which has not been raised to a tem
perature sufficient for a slight decomposition, does not still
retain some traces of water, Marignac obviated it by employing
in his determination crystallized chloride of barium, which could
be obtained perfectly pure, of a definite composition, and which

was unalterable  in the air. For the mode of purifying this and
the other salts used in the experiment, as well as for the precau
tions and corrections necessary in the experiment, the original
memoir must be consulted%.
   The method employed consisted in precipitating a known
weight of chloride of barium by nitrate of silver, and then pre
cipitating the barium as sulphate, and from the relation between
the chloride of silver and the sulphate of barium thus formed,
deducing the equivalent of barium. The result of these experi
ments gave the numbers 68-61, 68-59, and 68-55, or as the mean
68:58, which is almost the same as that formerly obtained, 68-57.
And Marignac considers that the sources of error which cannot
be eliminated are sufficiently large to justify the adoption of the
number 68-5. The method used for the determination of the
atomic weight of strontium was essentially the same.            The
results of  experiments    made with  perfectly pure  salts gave for
the equivalent of strontium the numbers 43-77,43-74, and 43-76.
The mean of these, 43-76, is exactly the mean of the numbers
43-67 and 43-85 found by Berzelius and by Pelouze. The num
bers hitherto adopted have been 43-5 and 44; but Marignac
thinks it impossible that the errors of experiment would justify
the adoption of either of these numbers. The equivalent of
strontium is almost certainly 43.75; and if we wish to assume
the existence of simple relations between equivalents, we must
lower still further the unit which serves as their common mea
 sure; and having halved it for chlorine, and perhaps for barium,
copper, and lead, we must again halve it for strontium. But
if this common relation be no longer the actual equivalent of
 hydrogen, but a fraction of that equivalent, there is no reason
 why this fraction should be # rather than #, or than any other
 smaller fraction, Tân for instance. That is to say, that this
 question of the existence of a unit, of which the weights of                           all
 chemical elements would        simple multiples, will always

218 Von Hauer on the Equivalents           of   Cadmium and Manganese.
of several metals, and has published the results of his determina
tions of cadmium and manganese.        His method is based on the
fact that the sulphates of zinc, cadmium, lead, copper, manganese,
cobalt, and nickel, when heated in sulphuretted hydrogen gas,
yield their respective sulphides of perfectly definite composition.
The sulphates of all these metals, with the exception of that of
lead, crystallize readily, and may therefore easily be obtained
pure.     They are also easily rendered anhydrous; and although
they are then somewhat hygroscopic, the influence on the weigh
ing may be avoided.      The reduction is effected at a moderately
low   temperature,  the results are uniform; there is no danger
from leaving the sulphide too long in contact with the gas, as it
is not altered thereby; there is no danger of mechanically carry
ing away any of the substance, provided the operation be not
conducted too rapidly; and further, sulphuretted hydrogen is a
gas which is readily obtained pure, and hence there is no fear of
introducing an impurity from that source.       By the reduction of
the sulphate to sulphide, 4 equivalents of oxygen are carried off
in the form of water. This loss amounts to 30 or 40 per cent.,
and hence in this important respect the determination is favour
able.    The determination is dependent on the purity of the sub
stance; and the only difficulty in execution lies in the reduction,
and the two weighings.
    For the determination of cadmium, a very pure sulphate was
prepared by frequent recrystallization: this was precipitated by
 sulphuretted hydrogen; the precipitate well washed out was
 dissolved  in hydrochloric acid, precipitated by carbonate of
ammonia, and after being well washed and dried, was ignited
to convert it into oxide.  This was then repeatedly washed with
water to free it from accidentally adhering chloride of cadmium,
and then dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, and the sulphate re
peatedly recrystallized. In order to free it from excess of acid,
the sulphate was heated to dull redness each time before -it was
dissolved.
   The reduction was effected in a glass tube heated by means of a
Bunsen’s burner, and the salt was placed in small porcelain trays.
The reduction was commenced at a moderate temperature, which
was gradually raised; the operation was continued some hours,
although it was found that from 5 to 8 grammes were reduced
in two hours. The reduced sulphide was allowed to cool in the
current of sulphuretted hydrogen, and was then weighed. It
was found that the sulphide was not at             all
                                                hygroscopic; each
time was tested for undecomposed sulphate. The mean

   The method by which these determinations were made is the
following:—Two thermo-elements, whose warm and cold soldering
points had the same temperatures, were compared with each other;
these formed a circuit with the coil of a multiplicator, which sur
rounded a magnet rod (of about a pound weight) to which was fast
ened a piece of looking-glass, thereby allowing the deflections of the
magnet to be observed at a distance by means of a telescope and
scale, in the same manner as observations are made with the mag
metometer.   Two commutators were also brought into the circuit; the
one  changed  the direction of the current in the wire of the multipli
cator, the other allowed the currents of the thermo-elements to pass
either so as to strengthen, or so as to oppose each other.
   The foregoing experiments were carried out in the Physical Ca
binet at Heidelberg, under the direction of Professor Kirchhoff, to
whose advice and assistance I am much indebted.

    The term matrix might be used in a more                                      general sense, but in

precisely similar to that for the addition of ordinary algebraical quan
tities; as regards their multiplication (or composition), there is the
peculiarity that matrices are not in general convertible; it is never
theless possible to form the powers (positive or negative, integral or
fractional) of a matrix, and thence to arrive at the notion of a
rational and integral function, or generally of any algebraical func
tion of a matrix.       I obtain the remarkable theorem that any matrix
whatever satisfies an algebraical equation of            own order, the coeffi its
cient  ofthe  highest    power   being  unity, and those      the other powers        of
functions       of

the immediate direction of Hekekyan Bey, an Armenian engineer
officer in the service of the Viceroy of Egypt; and a brief biogra

fications for such researches. The author had the advantage of ob
taining the zealous cooperation of our Consul-General in Egypt, the
Honourable Charles Augustus Murray, and his successor, the Honour
able Frederick Bruce, on whose representations the late Viceroy
Abbas Pacha, and the present, not only gave a ready assent to the
undertaking, but, with a rare and most exemplary liberality, ordered

which modify the deposition of the sediment in different parts of the
valley, showing how the coarser and heavier matter held in suspen
sion in the inundation water must be deposited in greatest amount
in the higher parts of the river's course, in      bed, and near                 by                                            its

   These propositions will suffice for the treatment of the first
thirteen propositions of Euclid's sixth book (Prop. I. excepted), and
of all the theorems and problems apparently involving proportions
of straight lines (not of areas, &c.) which usually present themselves.
The author then proceeds, as an instance of their application, to
prove by means of them the following theorem:—
   If pairs of tangents are drawn externally to each couple of three
unequal circles, the three intersections of the tangents of each pair
                                                                       -
will be in one straight line.
  Also a paper was read by Professor De Morgan, “On a Proof
of the existence of a Root in every Algebraic Equation : with an
examination and extension of Cauchy's Theorem of Imaginary
Roots; and remarks on the proofs of the existence of Roots given
by Argand and by Mourey.”
  The extension of Cauchy's theorem is very easily found, when the
proof is the first of those given by Sturm in Liouville's Journal.
The extended theorem is as follows:—
     Let    any function of 2, and let z=a+y M-1.
            p2 be                                        Let                                       (a,   y)

 a           any circuit which does not cut itself. Let this point
          point     on
describe the circuit    the positive direction
                                 in               revolution; and,               of
 p(x+y       v–1)        being   P+Q. v.–1, let                 §      change sign     k   times   as    in
 +0–,        and  l      times   as   in   —0+.                 Let   (w,   y)   be
                                                                                 called   radical
                                                                                            a
point when p(x            +
                          y      V–1) =0, or=oo.                         Let there     be radical

circuit.        Then
                                     k—l=2m+m'—(2n+n').
   Sturm’s demonstration of the case where m'-0, n=0, n'-0,
which is Cauchy's theorem, assumes the existence of the roots of
an algebraical expression.  Mr. De Morgan's proof of the existence
of these roots is as follows:—He shows, a priori, that in the se
quence of signs which Cauchy's theorem requires to be examined,
k—l never undergoes any alteration except after 0 and co have
coincided, that      where P=0, Q=0, simultaneously.
                               is,                                                                              It   is
then easily proved that change      k—l happens     every algebraical
                                                         in                          in
equation.
   The proofs given                  by
                        Argand and Mourey were intended         illus                                      as

234                       Geological Society:—
A   mass of brick-earth, 10 feet by 8, forms a core to the ferruginous
clay in the furrow. It is to be remarked that the sand-bed is here
about 100 feet above the sea-level; and also that it is intersected by a
deep dell.    The angular flint-gravel, underlaid by the sands, stretches
across Slindon Common, and occurs at Broxgrove Common, and
at intervals towards Goodwood.         At Waterbeach, adjoining Good
wood, a sand-pit shows, in descending order, 1. ferruginous clay,
full of angular flints, two to six feet; 2. chalk-rubble, about nine
feet thick, containing small angular flints, and with a furrowed sur
face; 3. fine ash-coloured sand, slightly micaceous, with thin seams
of concretionary sandstone, some few boulders of chalk, and friable
shells.
    The shingle-bed, seen at Avisford, is here replaced by chalk
rubble, like that overlying the old beach at Brighton; but no shells
nor bones were found.         Shells of the common Mytilus and the
edible Cardium are found in the sand, but they are usually very fri
able; and in the holes made by Pholades on the large lumps of hard
white chalk occurring in this sand, specimens of Purpura lapillus
occur, whilst small Balani are attached to the surfaces of these chalk
boulders.     A specimen of Echinocyamus pusillus was also met with.
This    sand-deposit, which the author believes to be identical with
the old Brighton beach, he traces also westward of Goodwood to
near Lavant and probably to Bourne Common.
    2. “On the Sedimentary and other External Relations of the
Palaeozoic Fossils of the State of New York.”           By  J. J. Bigsby,
M.D., F.G.S.
   The objects proposed in this inquiry were—to give more pre
cision to facts as yet imperfectly ascertained, to discover new
materials for the history of these earliest times, and to treat of
new points of connexion between the Palaeozoic Basins of New
York and Wales. The first part of this memoir commenced with a
few observations on the agencies by which the palaeozoic sediments
or sea-bottoms were laid down, namely, 1st the constant and super
ficial, or Neptunian, and 2nd the modifying or occasional and sub
terranean (Plutonic); and then proceeded to describe their mineral
character.     In the second part, the distribution and immediate
relations of palaeozoic animal life in the State of New York were
considered; and in the third part the recurrence or vertical range
of fossils was treated of in detail. Lastly, the results arrived at by
the author were given as reflections presenting themselves on a
survey of the ancient and vastly prolonged processes that laid down
the palaeozoic strata of New York.        The unity of design and pre
determination of the complete idea manifest in these geological
phaenomena,—the evidences of direct creation and of occasional
migrations,—the conditions of contemporaneity, -the relations of
geographic and epochal centres of life, the laws of recurrence of
animal forms, or their reappearance in new epochs, and of the dis
appearance of faunae,      and lastly the points of similarity and of
dissimilarity between the palaeozoic rocks of Wales and New York
were, in the concluding portion of the memoir, fully dwelt upon.

Prof. Harkness on Jointings, and on the Dolomites near Cork. 235
       June   9.-L.    Horner, Esq., Vice-President, in the Chair.
                                                                       :
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On Jointings, and on the Dolomites near Cork.”      By Professor
 Harkness,   F.R.S., F.G.S.                                            ,
 .  The strata in the neighbourhood of Cork consist of Devonian
rocks, and the lower portion of the Carboniferous series.         In the
former a regular system of north and south joints occur, cutting
through the strata at nearly right angles to their strike. The car.
boniferous rocks are also intersected by joints having a similar
 direction; but in these latter rocks other joints occur, one system
of which approaches to the horizontal, and the other is inclined
sometimes towards the east, at other times towards the west. This
threefold system of jointings, which make their appearance in the
carboniferous rocks, is not equally prevalent in all the members of
this series.
    The limestones in which they occur in the greatest perfection are
such as have the greatest amount of carbonate of lime, and are of
the purest character.
    In some siliceous limestones, which are associated with the more
perfectly jointed rocks, the series of jointings is confined to such as
prevail in the Devonian strata, these having only the north and
 south system of divisional planes.      Respecting the north and south
series of  joints,  the author is disposed to regard them as resulting
j
from   pressure,   caused by  the movements which have given to the
strata in the south of Ireland an arrangement in the form of rolls,
having an east and west strike, a course at right angles to the
 direction of the principal joints.
    In connexion with these north and south joints, both in the lime
 stones of the carboniferous series and also in the underlying carbo
 miferous slates, the author has noticed distortion of fossils, and this
 distortion consists of an elongation between the series of joints, the
fossils being pulled as it were out towards the sides of these planes,
 or at right angles to the strike of the joints.
    Prof. Haughton has already noticed the elongation of the fossils
 in the direction of the strike of cleavage, a mode of elongation at
           with that described by Prof. Phillips and the late Mr. D.
   harpe.
    As this direction (of distortion), however, occurs among strata in
 the north of Ireland devoid of cleavage, the author is disposed to
 regard it as resulting rather from jointing than from cleavage; and
 he regards it as evidence that pressure has exerted considerable     in
 fluence in producing joints.     Concerning the other two systems of
joints, which are peculiar to the purer limestone, these have a dis
 position to split the masses of limestone into rhomboids; and these
 divisional planes, the author considers, result from the same cause
 as the principal joints; but, owing to the pure state of the lime
 stone, lines of division akin to mineral cleavage have intersected
 these strata, and given to them their complex series of jointings.
    Dolomites also occur in the limestones of the district around
 Cork. They usually are met with in a dyke-like form, and in
 general are found conforming to the strike of the perpendicular

 236                      Geological Society:—
 north and south joints, or, in other words,
                                          -
                                               intersecting the strata at
 right angles.
    In some instances, however, they have an east and west course,
 and are found associated, in this condition, with the siliceous lime
 stones which possess only the principal system of joints.
    These dolomites, from their mode of occurrence, have had their
 origin subsequent to the production of the joints, and are often
 found thinner below than above.        From the circumstances of their
 occurrence, the author is disposed to regard them as metamorphosed
 ordinary limestones; and the metamorphic action he is disposed to
 attribute to sea-water, which, containing sulphate of magnesia, has
 found access, by means of the joints, into the limestone masses; and
 this, at an elevated temperature, combined with pressure, has pro
 duced these changes, by the double decomposition of sulphate of
 magnesia and carbonate of lime, and, by this means, given rise to
 the production of the dolomites occurring in this neighbourhood.
    2. “On an Experiment in melting and cooling some of the Rowley
 Rag.” By W. Hawkes, Esq.
    About 31 cwt. of basalt was melted in a large double reverberatory
 furnace, and after a slow cooling during thirteen days, it presented
 an upper stratum of stony vesicular matter, about 1 inch thick, next
 a layer of black glass, from 2 to 8 inches deep on that side of the
 mass which was exposed to the air from the door of the furnace
 (elsewhere, immediately under the vesicular layer was solid stone,
 interspersed here and there with air-bubbles). Mr. Hawkes added
 some observations relating to the results of experiments which he
 had made to ascertain the temperature of melted cast iron, and of
 melted basalt.
    3.   “On  the Iron Ores of Exmoor.”     By Warington Smyth, Esq.,
 M.A., Sec. Geol. Soc.
    The author described the occurrence of ores of iron within a
 district, of about thirty miles in length, between Ilfracombe and the
 Bridgewater Flats, in slaty rocks belonging to the “greywacke” of
 De la Beche’s “Report on Cornwall,” or to the “Plymouth group”
 of the Devonian System, as described by Sedgwick and Murchison.
 They are situated partly to the north, but chiefly to the south, of
 the irregular bands of limestone which pass from Combe Martin
 eastward by Simonsbath to Cutcombe and Treborough. The really
 stratified deposits of iron-ore are bands of argillaceous nodules,
 alternating with shales, similarly to those of the coal-measures;
 and these have been found in abundance on the flank of Hangman
 Hill near Combe Martin, and in the North Forest of Exmoor; but, in
 general, their angle of inclination is too great to allow of their being
 worked in competition with the analogous ores of the coal-fields.
    The lodes containing iron-ore, extensively worked some centuries
 ago, and which have recently been explored in the Brendon Hills,
 and tested on the property of F. W. Knight, Esq., M.P., are so
nearly conformable to the beds of slate, striking about E. 10° S.,
 with a dip of from 45° to 65° southward, that they might be easily
taken for stratified deposits.

               Mr. W. Smyth      on the Iron Ores   of Eamoor,         287
     In several places,  as at Cornham Ford, the Roman lode, and the
little Woolcombe       lode, haematite has been found at or near the
surface, containing 98.4 per cent. of peroxide of iron, in masses
which present the structure of sparry iron or carbonate.           Most of
the lodes, however, especially those of the Deer-park on Exmoor,
 and Raleigh's Cross, consist of brown or hydrous peroxide, generally
 occurring in large cavernous masses, with the interior of the cells often
 lined with brilliant but minute crystals of Goethite (pure hydrous
 peroxide), yet exhibiting the rhombohedral structure of sparry ore.
 Analysis shows this ore, especially from certain of the Exmoor
 veins, to contain 71.3 per cent. of peroxide of iron, together with
 a considerable per-centage of oxide of manganese.
     Lastly, several of the veins prove in depth to consist of sparry
  ore (siderite or carbonate of iron), containing a notable per-centage
 of carbonate of manganese. This has especially been shown at
  Goosemoor, Huel Eliza, Hangley Cleave, and on Kentisbury Down.
  The width of these veins varies from a few inches to above 20 feet,
  and at the greatest depth hitherto reached, 140 feet, there is no de
  terioration in size.    Quartz-veinstone and fragments of slate occa
  sionally fill part of the lodes; and this fact, coupled with the       in
  terruptions of “slides” and “heaves,” has led to some misplaced
  disappointment on the part of those who made their calculations
  without taking into account the capricious nature of true veins.
      Hence it appears,      1st, that the vein-fissures have been formed
  in this district almost solely in planes conformable to those of
  stratification, and that, after having been filled with carbonate of iron,
   quartz, &c., they have been more or less disturbed.
      2ndly. That the sparry ore has been converted, often to a great
   depth, into Goethite or pure hydrous peroxide, the consequent de
   crease of bulk giving rise to the cellular cavities lined with crystals.
      3rdly. That some smaller portions have been converted into
  haematite, having probably passed through the intermediate stage
   of brown peroxide.
      4thly. The pebbles of haematite at the base of the New Red in
   the adjoining district appear to be derived from these lodes, and
   would indicate their having been filled with ore prior to the great
   spread of deposits of red and brown iron-ore which took place in
   S.W. England and South Wales soon after the deposition of the
   coal-measures.
      The interest attached to these pseudomorphous changes, and to
   the scale on which they have taken place, is heightened by com
   parison with the ores of Siegen, of Sommorostro near Bilboa, and
   those brought by Dr. Livingstone from Central Africa.
      4. “On Native Copper in the Llandudno Mine, near Great Orme's
   Head, North Wales.”          By Capt. W. Vivian, of the Llandudno
    Mine.
      The author described some microscopic arborescent crystallizations
    of native copper occurring with ruby copper in small cavities in a
   brown limestone, which contains yellow bisulphuret of copper.
    Harder sulphurous ore occurs in the bed below, and carbonates and
    oxides of copper in the bed above.      The arborescent copper is pro

                                                                                <U+017F>
  288,              Intelligenes and Miscellaneous    4rticles.  . .
  bably the result of the decomposition of copper-ores, and has been
  formed subsequently to the crystals of lime in the limestone, which
  are often tipped with an octahedron of ruby oxide, or overlaid with
  spikes of the native copper.                                                -
      5.  “On    the Slate-rocks    and Trap-veins of Easdale and      Oban.”
  By Professor James Nicol, F.G.S.
      The author first described the mineral characters of the clay-slate:
  of the Islands of Easdale and Seil, and noticed the iron-pyrites and
  the veins of calc-spar and of quartz oceurring in the slate, as well
  as the gritty and calcareous strata that are detected as interstra
  tified with the more highly cleaved beds of the slate; also some soft
  carbonaceous beds and some hard calcareous nodules, imbedded in
  the slate. In one of these modular masses, at a depth of 140 feet
  from the surface, a small quantity of bituminous coal was stated to'
  have been lately found.          Fucoidal or annelidal markings occa
  sionally appear in the slates. Prof. Nicol then described the ori
  ginal but obscure stratification of the Easdale slate, which, with
  care, is seen to present beds disposed in undulations, and, where
  most clearly seen, dip at a high angle to the west or north-west.
  Near Oban, and along the Sound of Kerrera, the stratification is
  more distinct, and the strata are very much contorted.            The slaty
  cleavage of the district was then treated of in detail.         Its average
 strike varies 20° from that of the beds; and the direction of strata
 and cleavage-planes have evidently a connexion with the more
  ancient and deep-seated causes         which   have produced      the most
 striking features in the configuration of the country; they are nearly
 parallel to the shores of Loch Linnhe, to the Island of Lismore, and to
 the great depressions occupied by Loch Etive, Loch Awe, and Loch
 Fyne. The trap-veins of Easdale and Oban were next described,
 especially a pitch-stone on Seil, and were shown to be of three
 periods.     At least two sets of the veins appear to be of a date sub
 sequent to the Jurassic period; and the author remarked, as an in
 stance of the very recent date of many of the great convulsions by
 which the present physical outline of Scotland has been produced,
 that the mountain-cliff, 1200 to 1500 feet high, forming the coast
 of Morne, between Ardtornish and Loch Linnhe, consists in half
 of the old gneiss, in half of lias-strata and recent trap, brought side
 by side with each other along an enormous fault, and now smoothed
down into one uniform mass.             In conclusion, Prof. Nicol stated
that he considered the Easdale slate to be of Lower Silurian age,
but younger than the slates of Birnam and Dunkeld.

tice with complete success.
   As the experimental data were given to me in confidence, I am
for the present bound in honour not to disclose the formula which I
deduced from them; but as I am desirous not to delay longer the
placing it upon record, I have recourse to the old fashion of sending
it to you in the form of an anagram, in which the letters that occur
in its verbal statement are arranged in alphabetical order, and the
number of times that each letter occurs is expressed by figures.

                                   BY PROF. BERGEMANN.
  I  have been led by my late investigations of Ehlite to make some
experiments upon other compounds of oxide of copper with phos
phoric acid and water, in order to ascertain whether these might not
also contain vanadic acid.     And although I have not again found
this acid, the  experiments yielded  unexpected results, inasmuch as                                           I
detected arsenic acid in all the minerals belonging to the phosphate
of copper group, and often in considerable quantities.       I was sur
prised at finding this acid, for     the researches     all
                                                         these minerals             on

No important,among
          element        the conditions of terrestrial climate is so
                    none has engaged so much attention, nor has
any other been systematically observed for so long a period, as
temperature: yet the time is comparatively recent when philo
sophers commenced to consider the laws of         distribution over its
the earth's surface      truly scientific spirit.
                                 in   a              1779 appeared        In
the mathematical            inquiries      of   Lambert,     in   which        an   attempt was
made      to   estimate the difference between the heat received by
the earth from the sun and the heat which             loses     radiation.
                                                                  it            by
Mayer had about the same time deduced his well-known law
from theoretical grounds, and                   by
                                       considering solar radiation alone
as the source of terrestrial heat.       Towards the close of the last
century our countryman, Richard Kirwan, attempted for the
first time       compare Mayer's law with existing observations,
               to to
and thus       arrive     general views regarding the climate

distribution of heat over the earth.        This elegant method of re
presentation has since been applied to other elements of terres
trial physics, such as atmospheric pressure, magnetic intensity
 and declination, and the distribution of the tides.
    While the science of terrestrial temperature was thus pro
 gressing by systematic induction from observed facts, some of                                                      its

of the seas and oceans are traversed by currents, whose tempe

with the conditions of the ocean in which the island is situated.
If the surface of the ocean is warmer than the air over the island,
the latter will gain in temperature by the interchange of currents
of air over both. If we abstract all other causes, it is obvious
that a point on the island would in this case be warmer, the
closer it happened to be to the sea; in other words,        tempe                                   its
rature would be function of its distance from the coast. The

Hence that part of the isothermal which has the greatest latitude
must be nearer to the coast than any other part, and that which
has the smallest latitude must be the most remote from the coast.
Isothermals which had been previously near the coast would now
no longer be closed curves, at least within the island, and thus
several might terminate on the coast as irregular arcs, with their
convex sides turned towards the equator.        the dimensions of        If

pare what has been done with the principles here put forward.
During the year 1851, a series of meteorological observations
were conducted under the management of a committee of the
Royal Irish Academy; and the stations, although not numerous,
were fortunately so distributed as to enable us to combine their
results in such a way as to clearly illustrate the thermal con
ditions of the island. The most important results are contained
in the Rev. Dr. Lloyd’s valuable memoir on the Meteorology of
Ireland *.
   As to temperature,     the observations had a twofold appli
cation:  1st, those referring to the temperature of the sea, and,
2ndly, those relating to the temperature of the air. A com
parison of both classes of observations establishes the fact of an
excess of temperature of the sea over the air, in 1851, amounting
to 3°8 Fahrenheit.      The mean temperature at Portrush, the
most northern station, during the same year, was 49°1; and
that at Castletownsend, the most southern, 52°1. The excess
of temperature of the sea over that of the           appears thus                air
greater than the greatest difference                       of
                                         temperature which could
arise between two stations               as

248                    Prof. Hennessy on the Distribution
could not be included in any of these groups, as their tempera
tures were respectively 49°-6 and 47°3.
   Before I had made these combinations, Dr. Lloyd had re
marked the singular difference between the temperature of the
inland stations and those on the coast.    In the small map which
accompanies his memoir, the isothermal lines are deduced from
the coast observations alone; and the author thus seems to indi
cate that these lines are intended to show the isothermals of the
air over the sea surrounding Ireland, but not the distribution of
temperature within the island itself.    From the comparatively
regular forms of such lines on the surface of the ocean, Dr. Lloyd
assumed that over a small space they might be regarded as ap
proximately straight; and he was thus enabled to apply the
method of least squares for the precise determination of their
positions.
   As    Icould not assume any definite form for the interior
isothermals, I could not use the method of least squares, and
have had to lay them down by the ordinary method of tracing
curve lines, each of which runs through a group of stations of
equal temperature.
   On looking at the map, it is apparent that, having first traced
the isothermal of 52° which runs along the south-west coast near
Cahirciveen and Castletownsend, the isothermal of the next
lowest temperature must fall completely inside
                                                                    it,
                                                         for two differ
ent isothermal lines cannot intersect.       But the line      51° runs      of
from Mayo        Waterford, and
                  to                   much longer than the line
                                               is                                            of
52°. The isothermal               of
                              50° must        like manner

within this, and      terminates on the north-east and north-west
                         it
coast respectively.     Thus            we
                                  have three open isothermals, until
we come      to
              that     49°, which runs along the north coast near
                         of
Portrush and Buncrana.         But             as

Ireland we thus   perceive  that the coldest district lies in the
north-east portion of the midland counties—probably somewhere
between the counties of Cavan and Tyrone, and that the warmest
region is situated along the coasts of Kerry and Cork.

conditions. The western coast alone is backed by any consider
able masses of elevated land; and the interior is generally far
from being so flat as the inland portions of Ireland.     Its position
with regard to the warmer and more prevailing winds, as well as
the magnitude of the Bristol Channel, indicates that this great
arm of the sea may exercise a remarkable influence on districts
in the valley of the Severn which might otherwise possess a cli
mate similar to places more strictly inland.       Lastly, the much

tribution of temperature, because in some extensive districts
observations are entirely wanting, although made in great num
bers in certain localities. Although these isothermals may thus
require some ulterior modifications, I have no reason to doubt
their faithfulness in presenting a general view of the distribution
of temperature.      The influence of distance from the coast, as
well as of   latitude, is very distinctly visible; and the arrange
ment of the isothermals evidently conforms to the same laws as
those of Ireland.
  The mean temperatures                           of stations where observations have
been made have been recorded usually                         in connexion with certain
coordinates of each station, namely,                                    its   latitude, longitude, and

The mean latitude of the coast stations is 6' greater than that of
the inland stations, and is thus slightly unfavourable to an excess
of temperature; yet the mean temperature of the former exceeds
that of the latter by 2° 3. The mean difference in height is 139
feet; consequently, if the greater warmth of the coast were due
to difference of elevation alone, the rate of decrease of atmo
spheric temperature in ascending over ground lying at an almost
insensible mean inclination to the horizon, would be 1° for 60
feet.   A supposition which leads to a result so discordant with
the best observations must be abandoned as altogether unte
nable.
   Hitherto, distance from the sea has but rarely entered into
temperature tables,   and then only for a limited number of
stations.        It
              now appears to possess claims to be definitively con
sidered as a fourth coordinate, and in the case of most of the
stations in the British islands it is undoubtedly the most im
portant after latitude. In the accompanying Tables a column has
been accordingly appended, in which the value of this element
is given in English miles. The distances are             taken from        all

the  maps  published      the  Society  for the Diffusion      Useful             of

                               have calculated entirely from other

with those contained in Professor Dove’s Tables.         In the Table
which exhibits the mean annual      temperature   of twenty-three   sta
tions in Ireland, the results marked L are given on Dr. Lloyd's
authority.     He estimated these numbers from the observations
of   1851,  by  subtracting 0°-3 from each, because in Dublin the
temperature of the year was in excess of the mean of twelve
years by that quantity. The mean temperatures so deduced are
probably much closer to their true values than the uncorrected
results of 1851. This may be noticed with reference to stations
where observations were made during other years, such as
Armagh and Markree, where the temperature is regularly
recorded at the astronomical observatories of Dr. Robinson and
 Mr. Cooper.
     The observations at Cove were made by Dr. Scott; at Cork,
 by Mr. Humphreys and his predecessors at the Royal Institu
 tion, also at the barracks; at Limerick and Kilrush, in con
 nexion with the Ordnance Survey; at Derry, by Mr. Patterson;
 at Waterford, by Dr. Cavet +; at Belfast, under the superinten
 dence of Professor Stevelly at the College.
     The isothermals of the northern portions of the two great
 continents which constitute the old and new worlds, exhibit, at
 least during the winter, very decided conformity to the same laws
  as those which are so manifest in the British Isles.
     On examining Professor Dove's large map of the isothermals
  of January and July (No. 3 in General Sabine's edition), it
  appears that during the former month the isothermals which
  traverse North America run very nearly parallel to            western             its
  coast; then bending, they run nearly parallel           the northern   to
  shores   ofthe Gulf     Mexico; afterwards they ascend towards the
                                of
  north-east, and cut the eastern coast                 of

   This formula may appeal cumbrous; but if it be allowed that
a true substitution of magnesia can take place by soda, which
mineralogists frequently assume; and by water, which is certainly
not more improbable; and that silicic acid (SiO4) may be re
placed by the triatomic aluminic acid which exists in Gibbsite
(3HO. Al” O”), and by the monatomic aluminic acid which is
found in diaspore (HO. Al” O”); then it will be found that this
mineral thermophyllite is essentially

the silicate of magnesia being partly replaced, at least in this

  boloid, whose director through the vertex is the z-axis.        It will
  also be noticed that the mutual     position  of the two  hyperboloids
 is completely defined by saying that the asymptotic plane, through
  the common director, to each surface must touch the other in the
 attracted point.    In fact it is well known that the pencil of tan
 gent planes, whose axis is the common director, is homographic
 at once with the system of their points of contact with the sur
 face H, and that formed by their points of contact with the
 surface H1.    Hence, whatever the position of the two surfaces,
 the points of contact of these planes constitute two homographic
 systems of points in the common director.          But when their posi
 tion is such as above   defined,  that is to  say,  when the points in
 each system which correspond, respectively, to the infinitely di
 stant points in the other system coincide, it is well known that
 the two homographic systems of points form a system in involu
 tion whose centre is at those coincident points.
     30. The theorem of art. 28, as above modified, leads easily to
the solution of the following problem:-Given any two equi
lateral hyperbolic paraboloids (H) and (H1), and a point O in
the director which passes through the vertex of the first (H), it
is required to place the second surface (H,) so that correspond
ing portions of both surfaces may attract O equally.                                          •
    The problem is solved by performing the following three ope
rations on (H1):—First. Make one of the directors through the
vertex of (Hi) coincide with the director of (H) in which the
point O is situated. Secondly. Make (H,) turn around the
common director until               its
                             asymptotic plane through that director
touches (H)        the point
                    in                       3.
                                     Thirdly. Make (H,) slide along
                                    rotating,   until the point
                                                                                      of of

for example, since the latter surface may be generated by a line
moving along two directors so as constantly to remain perpen

a circle moving so as always to pass through a fixed point, to

Each section (O), (O), therefore, is a curve of the third degree
passing through the circular points at infinity and having two
coincident foci in the origin O.  Each curve, too, consists of an
oval and a serpentine branch, each of which is symmetrically
placed with respect to the w-axis, and the negative inverse of the
other with respect to a circle, around the origin as centre, with
the radius

        MONGST the geological      phaenomena which give rise to
       evolutions of gases and vapours thrown into the atmo
sphere at a high temperature, there are scarcely any which merit
in a higher degree to                   fix

which accompany the Boracic Acid in the Lagoons                             of Tuscany. 285
   In      one single locality, boracic acid occursin solution in a
true small lake, which is actually called Lago.
    M. de Larderel, the proprietor of the boracic acid works, has
recently caused to be made artesian borings which have fur
mished him with boiling waters, accompanied by the same gaseous
emanations and holding in solution boracic acid to an amount
at least equal to that of the waters of the lagoons. They rise
to a considerable height (about 20 metres) at the moment
when the borer meets with them, and cause an eruption of muddy
matters and stones which recall the phaenomena of the Geysers of
Iceland.
    The tertiary soil, in the midst of which these emanations break
forth, consists of a compact limestone with spathic veins called
alberese, converted into gypsum in many localities, of micaceous
 grit called macigno, and schistose clays.
    The triangular space comprised within these various ema
 nations is included between the culminating points of Monte
 Catini, Monte Calvi, and the mountain Gerfalco. The soil is
 traversed at several points by masses of serpentine.
    In the course of the autumn of 1857, being encouraged by
 the kind offers addressed to us by the Count de Larderel, whose
 recent loss we have to deplore, we made our preparations for a
journey into Tuscany. We started provided with              the appa                all

It will only be after the complete exposition of our investigations
that we shall be able to devote ourselves to the discussion of the
hypotheses suggested by the totality of the facts, and that we
shall show the relations of these singular strata with the principal
geological conditions of the country,         -
   To collect the   gases, we have in    general   employed the same
means which have been described in our          previous  memoir upon
the volcanic emanations of Southern Italy”.           Nevertheless the
circumstance of the evolution of gases under pressure at the sur
face of the soil, and the facility with which the points of emanation
may be surrounded, have permitted us to             tubes open    both            fill                          at

Monte Rotondo and Sasso is extremely interesting to study in
regard to the modifications which these emanations undergo
from the bottom of the valley up to the summit of the ridge.
A little above Monte Rotondo vapours are met with issuing from

the following conclusions:—
     1.The temperature                    of
                               the gases, both      the soffioni and      in

     2.All the emanations contain the same gases, the proportions
    which even are but slightly variable.                                  As

following,          the gases without exception contain          mixture                     a                of
free hydrogen and protocarbonated hydrogen (C*H*),                    which                        of
the sum attains                on

fissure which joins Larderello and Castelnuovo, the proportion
of   the two combustible gases            nearly unity, the carbonated

 hydrogen nevertheless having a tendency to predominate; the
 reverse is the case with the other centres of emanations, espe
 cially at Lago, where the proportion of hydrogen to the carbon
 ated gas attains 1:0:27.
    The presence of hydrogen in these emanations presents a new
feature of resemblance to the celebrated geysers and solfataras
of Iceland, and confirms the opinion previously expressed by one
of us. But the simultaneous existence of carbonated hydrogen
seems to differentiate the soffioni from the emanations of Iceland,
where, as is well known, M. Bunsen has never signalized the
latter gas.

on account of the unevenness of the faces. One crystal appeared
to be either a combination of the forms 1 1 0, 0 1 1, 4 1 1, or
else a twin, the individuals of which are combinations of the forms
1 1 0, 0 1 1, having 1 1 1 for the twin face.        This is probably
the combination observed by Descloizeaux (Ann, des Mines, sér. 4.
i. 482).          I
              was unable to discover a trace of the form given upon

that, apart from the testimony of the finder, he is convinced by
the appearance of the specimen that it must have come from the
bear of a blast furnace.    Other instances of the occurrence of
garnet in furnace products were observed by v. Kobell and Studer

No attempt was made to analyse the crystals, or to determine

Acetate of propyle-glycol is a colourless neutral liquid, insoluble
in water, and with an odour somewhat resembling acetic acid.
It boils at 186°C., and has the specific gravity 1-109.
   Propyle-glycol was obtained by treating pure acetate with hy
drate of potash and distilling the mixture.    This distillate was
rendered slightly alkaline with a small quantity of potash,                                                  di

paration of propyle-glycol and of lactic acid is propylene gas,
which may be prepared from purely inorganic materials.
   Amylc-glycolº is prepared in a similar manner. The ace
tate of amyle-glycol is first prepared by acting upon bromide
of amylene with acetate of silver; and, from the acetate, amyle
glycol is obtained by the action of potash.       When pure it is a
colourless, syrupy, bitter liquid, becoming viscous at low tempe
ratures. Its specific gravity (0.987) is lower than that of propyle
glycol.    It boils at 177°C., and distils without decomposition;

  298                           Royal Society:—
  Schlippe” has discovered an acid belonging to the oleic series,
  which lies between acrylic and angelic acids.
     After the saponification of the fatty acids contained in this oil,
  which are stearic, palmitic, myristic, and lauric acids, besides
  probably some higher members of the oleic series, an almost
  black subjacent liquor remains, which contains the new acid
  along with other substances.             For the purpose of separation,
  this liquid   was  distilled,   on which an acid liquid passed over.
  This was neutralized with baryta, and the baryta salt distilled
  with tartaric acid, when oily drops passed over along with the
  acid liquor, and towards the end of the operation crystals of an
  gelic acid were deposited in the condenser.             This distillate was
  neutralized with baryta, and again distilled with tartaric acid,
  and this treatment repeated.           Finally, some of the baryta com
 pound was distilled with aqueous phosphoric acid. In the receiver
 the acid was obtained in the form of limpid oily drops along with
 a small quantity of water, in which it is tolerably soluble.                It
 contained, however, other acids; and for the purpose of separa
 tion, recourse was had to partial distillation.           Of the acid which
 first distilled,  a silver salt was     prepared,  which gave on analysis
 numbers      agreeing   with the formula C*H* Ag O", which would
 be the formula of the silver salt of an acid between angelic and
 acrylic acids. Schlippe names the acid crotonic acid.
    The acids of this series decompose when heated with excess of
 caustic potash into acctic acid and an acid of the same series:
 thus angelic acid decomposes into acetic acid and propionic acid;
 oleic acid into acetic acid and palmitic acid. In like manner,
 crotonic acid, if it belong to this series, ought to decompose into
 two equivalents of acetic acid,

found them exceedingly noteworthy.                  Lastly,                    I
                                                                 have made certain
experiments upon the external auditory canals of the sound ears.
   I   compare, then, with one another, the phenomena yielded by a
normal ear, an ear with an open Eustachian tube, an ear with the drum
impaired in a particular manner, and an ear whose external meatus is
 in a known altered condition; calling in facts from other sources in
aid; and, finally, endeavour to determine the uses to be assigned
to the several structures of the drum in order to embrace all the
phenomena”.
   I   assure myself that my Eustachian tubes are ordinarily shut, by
 the   difficulty   (greater for my left one) of forcing the breath into the
 drums when I stop my mouth and nose, and the hinderment to                                                      its
 escape till      I swallow        eructate, showing that those acts open the
                                           or

 firmly, and the faucial parts swell and stick together.

without a careful consideration.
    Let us inquire, then, what influence the existence of a membrana
tympani would, under this supposition, exert on hearing. Sonorous
vibrations impressed upon the walls of the head, that                         the ex                               is,   of
ternal meatus, are heard more loudly when we anyhow cover this
canal      so   as   to

I   have used various materials for           closing   the meatus, have plugged
the    entrance,   and laid the     thing   over                      it,

    excludes both tympanic and outer sounds from the labyrinth. Deaf
    mess produced by disease in the external meatus only yields noises
    when it propagates irritation so as to excite secretion of mucus on

Dr.Tyndall's statement, that “the hazysurfaces produced by the com
pression of the mass were observed to be in a state of intense commo
tion, which followed closely upon the edge of the surface as it advanced
through the solid. It is finally shown that these surfaces are due to
the liquefaction of the ice in planes perpendicular to the pressure.”
   There can be no doubt but that the “oscillations” in the melting
point of ice, and the distinction between strong and weak pieces in
this respect, described by Dr. Tyndall in the second section of his
paper, are consequences of the varying pressures which different por
tions of a mass of ice must experience when portions within it
become liquefied.
   The elevation of the melting temperature which my brother's
theory shows must be produced by diminishing the pressure of ice
below the atmospheric pressure, and to which       alluded as a subject I
for experimental illustration, in the article describing my experi
mental demonstration of the lowering effect of pressure (Proceedings,
Roy. Soc. Edinb. Feb. 1850), demonstrates that a vesicle of water
cannot form in the interior of a solid of ice except at a temperature
higher than 0° Cent. This is a conclusion which Dr. Tyndall ex
presses as a result of mechanical considerations: thus, “Regarding
heat as a mode of motion,” “liberty of liquidity is attained by the
molecules at the surface of a mass of ice before the molecules at the
centre         mass can attain this liberty.”

   The   physical   theory shows that a removal of the atmospheric
pressure would raise the melting-point of ice by rinths of a degree
Centigrade.     Hence it is certain that the interior of a solid of ice,
heated   by  the condensation of solar rays by a lens, will rise to at
least that excess of temperature above the superficial parts. It appears
very nearly certain that cohesion will prevent the evolution of a
bubble of vapour of water in a vesicle of water forming by this process
in the interior of a mass of ice, until a high “negative pressure” has
been reached, that is to say, until cohesion has been called largely
into operation, especially if the water and ice contain little or no air
by absorption (just as water freed from          may         air

      On the Use      of the Aneroid   Barometer as an Orometer.     305
  led the author, as Chief Engineer in charge of the Expedition, to
  provide (among other instruments) some aneroids, as a means of
  saving time in ascertaining the levels of the mountain passes of that
  Island. The aneroids offered by makers did not appear sufficiently
  graduated to admit of minute observation, and at the author's sug
  gestion Messrs. Elliott furnished a more complete vernier, which,
  however, was shown to be susceptible of material improvement.
     With these comparatively imperfect instruments, it was shown
  that an elevation of 950 feet may be taken to correspond with the
  fall through the first inch of the aneroid; that about 970 feet more
  corresponds with the fall through the second inch, and about 1000
 feet corresponds with the fall through the third inch. These altitudes
  having been checked by levels taken with the ordinary surveyor's
  spirit-level, it was shown that this experience corresponds with the
  Tables published by Mr. Belville, within 1 per cent.
     The thermometer, which is usually attached to the aneroid, is not
  a necessary adjunct, but is frequently useful, and always interesting.
 The compensations introduced to provide against variations of tempe
 rature, as affecting the results given by the instrument, were shown
 to be effectual without the aid of the thermometer.
     The difficulties to be contended with in taking accurate observa
‘tions were shown to be local variation, diurnal variation, and some
 irregularity in the action of the mechanical parts of the instrument
 itself.   These difficulties were examined seriatim, and modes of ap
 proaching to their corrections were explained.      The modes of com
 pensation for variations of temperature affecting the instrument were
 shown as at present practised by the makers: the diaphragm-box
 being compensated by means of the introduction of a small portion
  of acriform fluid, instead of being allowed to act with a perfect va
  cuum, and the metallic connexions between the diaphragm-box and
  the index being compensated by compound arms or connexions of
 steel and brass so adjusted as to neutralize mutually the respective
 contraction or expansion of each at variations extending to 100 de
 grees of temperature.
     The mode now practised by makers of graduating the aneroid
 (when thus compensated) by comparison with a standard mercurial
 barometer, was stated, and it was suggested that improvement on this
 practice might be made by reference to standard elevations running
 up to 2000 feet at least in Great Britain. Practical examples were
 given of the use of the instrument in Ceylon, showing the variations
 of the aneroid (when properly checked) to       lie
                                                   between   foot and

barometrical vacuum in which the mercury had been carefully boiled,

 of a magnet was presented to the positive ball, the stratifications
were drawn to the length of two or three inches down the tube.
    In the sealed tubes the stratified discharge was obtained by fric
 tional electricity; and if a charged Leyden jar is discharged through
the vacuum by a wet string, the stratifications are as distinct as from
 the induction-coil.

charge of the primary current excited by a single cell, the entire
 tube, whatever may be                   its

  Former investigations had led me to some general conclusions re
garding the molecular constitution of the organic bases, which I have
communicated to the Royal Society, and which have been published
in the ‘Transactions’ (1850, p. 93; 1851, p. 357). My experi
ments had proved that each equivalent of hydrogen in ammonium may
be replaced by an equivalent of a mono-atomic electro-positive radical,
such as methyle, ethyle, &c.;-a series of compound ammoniums
being produced, the salts of which may be thus formulated:—

scriptive and controversial, the second is an abstract of the system.

than     his clear apprehension.
         in                         Aristotle, who first implicitly made
the distinction      form and matter, was
                             of                  mathematician; and so                  a
also was Kant, who first explicitly introduced this distinction into
the definition        logic.

   A name is used in four senses. It is the name of an object, or of
a quality  inhering in an object, and distinguishing a class: these two
uses are   objective.   It is also the name of a class, or of an attribute
by which the mind thinks of a class: these two uses are subjective.
The subjective uses are reductions of plurality to unity, a description
for the truth and reality of which the author contends.
   It is affirmed that the logicians have not only confined themselves
within the mathematical side of logic, but that even the recent
attempts to introduce the metaphysical appear like attempts to
create a second mathematical branch.           This is evidenced by the
manner in which      unity  of attribution has been discarded in favour of
plurality of qualification. Thus it has been said, in obedience to
the theory of quantification of the predicate, that the humanity of
Newton is a different thing from the humanity of Leibnitz. That
this view, though true, belongs to the mathematical side of logic, is
contended for and enforced at length.
   Aristotle made the distinction which the logicians now recognize
as that of extension and comprehension, and which Mr. De Morgan
distinguishes as that of mathematical and metaphysical reading, as
follows:—In one sense the species is in the genus : in another the
genus is in the species. That                  is,
                                         all the species are aggregants          the                   of
genus: the whole genus               component
                                     is   a         the notion  of    the species.       of
   Recent English logicians              high name have misconceived this
                                              of
distinction    to the extent      imagining that by changing “Every
                                     of                                                                 A
                                every A, they make the change alluded                                       to is
some B' into ‘Some              B   is
 by  Aristotle.     Mr. De     Morgan      restores the old distinction, and
completely incorporates what was only partially introduced, the
change   of quantity which takes place              passing from the mathe

De Morgan calls it the arithmetical whole, transferring the word
mathematical to what was called the logical whole.      The common
mode of expression, as ‘Every A is B,' &c., he considers as speaking
the language of the arithmetical whole, though the speaker may
attach the idea of either of the other wholes.
   Extension predominates in the mathematical whole; intension in
the metaphysical.    The most usual mode of speech is the physical :
man is educated a mathematician as to the subject of his proposition,
a metaphysician as to the predicate.
    The most remarkable point at issue between Mr. De Morgan and
the logicians, is in his opposition to their notion of the whole attribute
                            is its
being the sum of          components. The difference between aggregation
 and composition          one       the turning-points
                                           of                  his whole system.    of
    The distinctions above drawn              require   differences       language             of                    to
express the relations which enter: the logicians have nothing but the
copula         At the outset, however, we have the distinction which
                is.                                                                                                  is

     which       it    is     that              A    is                      B.
    By speaking         the arithmetical whole, the logicians have made
                            in
 system        syllogism from which the numerical syllogism cannot
                of                                                                                                   be a
excluded.        The propositions “Some As are Bs,’ and ‘50 As are
Bs,’ are       the same kind they are both referred
                 of                        ;                          the arithmetical    to
whole.      This whole           subordinate
                                      is                            to
                                                      both the mathematical and
metaphysical wholes; though more prominent                          the first than       in                          in
the second.
    When inclusion and exclusion are opposed                       one another, and      to
combined with assertion and denial, the ordinary proposition takes
a  form       which quantity

  the effects symmetrical; in the fourth confined to one side of the
  chest.    Enormous development of the calves in one of the cases.
     Also a paper was read “On Organic Polarity,” by H. F. Baxter, Esq.
     The object of the paper is to show the intimate connexion that
  exists between organic force and the ordinary polar forces, such as
  chemical force, for example.
     The principal experiments, showing that organic action, viz. secre
  tion, is accompanied with the manifestation of current force, have
  already appeared in the Royal Society's ‘Transactions’ for the years
  1848 and 1852; but in the present communication the author
  enters more minutely into the resemblance between the actions
  which take place in the voltaic circle and those that occur during
  secretion than could be prudently attempted in his previous papers.
  But whatever view may be entertained in regard to the origin of
  the power in the voltaic circle, whether by mere contact or by
  chemical action, the decision of this point is of no importance to the   .
 question under consideration; since the manifestation of current
 force during voltaic action is allowed both by the chemical theorist
 as well as the contact theorist; and if we admit the manifestation
  of this force (current force) to be evidence of polar action in one
 class of cases, viz. during voltaic action, we are certainly justified
 in logically concluding that it may be adduced as evidence of polar
 action in other cases also, viz. during organic action as in secretion.
 Reference is made to Prof. Graham's researches on osmose. Accord
 ing to Prof. Graham, osmose would appear to be dependent upon
 chemical action, and consequently, should we be disposed to class
 the phaenomena of secretion with those of osmose, we should be
 thus compelled to acknowledge that the act of secretion must be
 polar in its nature.
     The author does not attempt to show in what manner secretion
 is effected, his great object being to point out what does occur
 during this act, viz. the manifestation of polar action, and conse
 quently it is upon this ground that we may logically infer that the
force must be Polan in its nature.

            ON   THE DOUBLE TANGENTS          TO PLANE CURVES.
O.
     BY THE REV. GEORGE SALMON, TRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN.
           of the most difficult problems in the theory of plane curves is
       that of finding the points of contact of double tangents to a curve
of the nth degree. A new solution of that problem may therefore
be acceptable.
    The tangent to a plane curve meets the curve in n–2 points
beside the point of contact.          If now it were possible to form the
equation of a curve of the (n–2)nd degree passing through those n–2
points, then by forming the condition that the tangent to the given
curve should touch this curve of the (n–2)nd degree, we should im
mediately obtain an equation to be satisfied by the points of contact
of double tangents. Now I have succeeded in forming the equation
of such a curve of the (n–2)nd degree, as follows.

         ON THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC  ROTATION OF LIQUIDS.
     -
                         BY A. BERTIN.            -
   Experiments upon electro-magnetic rotations are usually made by
employing, as moveable conductors, copper wires turning round a
central pivot.   By this method, however, none but slightly varied
phaenomena can be observed; and in this manner the electro-dynamic
theories can only be submitted to a small number of verifications.
It is otherwise when a liquid is taken as the moveable conductor.
The experiment is also very easy: it is sufficient to cause a current
to pass into a liquid, taking as electrodes two concentric circles of
copper, and to submit it at the same time to the action of a magnet,
an electro-magnet, or an electro-dynamic coil.    The liquid is imme
diately seen to turn rapidly round the common centre of the two
electrodes, even when the pile employed consists only of a small
number of elements.      On changing its place, the rapidity and the
direction of the rotation are varied, according to the position given
to the moveable current.      These changes are subject to the fol
lowing laws:—
   1. The centrifugal and centripetal currents turn in opposite direc
tions, other things remaining the same.
   2. There is a series of points in the space where the rotation is
null: their totality constitutes a neutral surface, on each side of
which the rotation changes its direction.
   3. For a vertical magnet, the neutral surface has for generator
a curve with two branches passing through the poles, and resembling
a hyperbola mounted upon the axis of the magnet.            Between the
two branches of this neutral line the rotation of the centrifugal cur
rent is positive, or in the same direction as the circulation of the
current which would produce magnetization; outside the neutral
line this rotation is in the opposite direction, or negative.
   Theory explains these phaenomena in their smallest details. The
action of the magnet upon the horizontal current which traverses
the liquid in the nearest part is a horizontal force perpendicular to
the moveable current, and has for          its
                                         expression

                        By   John BRIDGE, M.A.”
        the Philosophical Magazine for October 1855, I suggested
 IN     the application of photography to the illustration of the
diffraction of light.                              I
                           The attempts which had then made were
sufficiently successful to warrant me in publishing that notice.
But renewing the experiments this summer, I have been able to
produce a very splendid series of phaenomena, which illustrate
the theory in every point.          First, we draw on a large sheet of
paper a series of figures arranged at equal distances in a circle.
A collodion picture of these being taken, we have a series of
small transparent apertures in the elsewhere opake film. This
is then mounted so that each may be in turn brought before the
centre of a telescope, which is adjusted to view an image of the
sun. In this manner we have an apparatus of the most compact
form, by which a series of fifty or more different phaenomena
may be viewed in a few minutes. Also the figures being very
small (occupying on an average an area one-tenth of an inch in
diameter), the inaccuracies of surface and substance of the glass
may be neglectedt.          There is another advantage in the figures
being small; for the size of the image is in inverse proportion to
the size of the aperture. For this reason the apertures have
been made as small as was consistent with sufficient brightness.
    I will now give a sketch of the several points which I have
sought to illustrate.       In doing so I will endeavour to simplify
the mathematical treatment of such questions, and to explain
some new and curious phaenomena.

case the positions           of maximum and minimum displacements will
be unaltered.
    (4) If any focal line (line through focus) be drawn, the inten
sities in it at equal distances from the focus are equal. This is
seen immediately in the formulae, for a change of sign of a does
not affect A*--B”. Or thus: the displacement at any time t in
the one     case   is equal to the displacement at the time                                 ;   —t in
the other case, so that the maximum displacements being the
same, the intensities are also the same in both cases.
   (5) Similar apertures give similar figures of diffraction with
dimensions inversely as their own.
  For if a. and y are multiplied, and at the same time a divided
by a constant, A and B will also be multiplied by the same
constant.
    Otherwise;  in a small right-angled triangle one side is con
stant if the   hypothenuse    and opposite angle vary inversely.
From this it appears that the displacements in two given planes
making angles with the apertures inversely as their dimensions
are the same.
   (6) If the apertures have the values of y equally distributed
on opposite sides of the axis of a, B=0, and A is double what it
would be on one side.
   (7) If the aperture be moved to any parallel position, so that
every w is increased by £, A and B become                       -

XXXVI.       On a Photochemical Method of recognizing the Non-vola
    tile Alkalies and Alkaline Earths.  By R. CARTMELL, Esq.”
A*   has long been known, the non-volatile alkalies, when put
     into the flame of a burning body, have the property of
communicating to it peculiar colours; and in the case of soda
and lithia, these colours are of considerable intensity.      As a
mere trace of soda, however, is sufficient entirely to obscure the
colours communicated to the flame by potash or lithia, this as a
means of distinguishing between them has hitherto been of very
limited application.   The following way of detecting them in
the presence of each other depends on a means of observing by
coloured media the characteristic rays of light which each emits
when heated strongly in a colourless gas flame.    On account of
the homogeneous nature of the colour given to the flame by soda,
I thought it possible to eliminate the soda reaction by the use
of a coloured medium. After a great many experiments with
various coloured solutions and other coloured media, I found
that a bluish-coloured solution would best accomplish this object.
The only solution that I have yet found to answer perfectly for
obliterating the colour of soda, and allowing other rays, namely
                                                               so
                                                                      it,

that it is met with in most laboratories as a reagent, is readily
diluted to the required intensity, and when so prepared will
keep good for some time.
   When the absence of potash has been ascertained by a method
which will be presently described, the above solution gives one
a means of rendering visible the red rays from lithia in the pre
sence of soda, when the proportions do not exceed one part of
the former to a thousand parts of the latter. When potash is
viewed through this indigo solution red rays are likewise ob
served, and these can be seen till the proportion of potash to
soda is less than one part to two hundred.      To distinguish pot
ash in the  presence of soda or  lithia,  it was necessary to find a
medium    through   which no coloured rays from soda or lithia
would pass, but which would admit those peculiar to potash. This
was found to be a deep blue cobalt glass which I had cut up for
the purpose. Potash viewed through this glass gives to the
flame an intense violet colour; and this is still visible when one
part of potash is present with two hundred parts of soda.          I
 have not  yet  succeeded in  getting    a medium that will  permit
                                                                                                    be all
rays from lithia to pass, and at the same time keep back
those from soda    potash. or  But the presence      lithia can              of

ever been a difficulty in distinguishing it when small quantities
are present.   Here         I
                       may add that this method is particularly
adapted to the discovery of small quantities of strontia; and also,
when the substances of this group occur in so small quantities
that they are no longer recognizable in the wet way: by the re
actions of the flame and coloured medium they are readily distin
guishable.
     The characteristic colours which baryta, strontia, and lime
communicate to the flame, are best observed when their sulphates
are exposed on the point of a piece of the finest platinum wire
to the outer part of an air-flame.               And further during the
burning, the colours they produce can be increased in intensity
by first putting them into the reducing flame, and then either
moistening them with hydrochloric acid, or by holding some
asbestos moistened with this acid in the flame directly under the
point of the platinum wire on which the substances are supported.

are to be  separated from the lime by filtration through as small
a filter as possible, and which has been previously washed out
with dilute nitric acid. When the precipitate is very small in
quantity, it is necessary to burn the filter, and then to test the
residue on platinum wire in the usual way. When strontia
occurs in very small quantity, it will not be precipitated; but
on adding ammonia and carbonate of ammonia, will go down

   The dilute solution of indigo, to distinguish between strontia
and lime, is made by diluting the common indigotic acid till it
gives with sulphate of lime an olive-green colour, on testing in
the manner directed.     Care must be taken not to make this
solution too dilute, otherwise sulphate of lime appears slightly
red through                        be  the same kind                                        as

which is always present, to burn off first, then the colours of the
other substances become distinctly visible.
   For this mode of distinguishing the alkalies and alkaline
earths, very small quantities of substance are necessary; and the
analyses can be made with somewhat better results when day
light is excluded.
   I am indebted to Professor Kirchhoff for determinations of
the rays which come through the solutions of indigo and the
blue glass that I have used in my experiments.             The dilute so

of solar heat upon ice.    The experiments were made with the
Wenham Lake and     Norway    ice.  Slabs were formed of the sub
stance, varying from one to several inches in thickness, and these
were placed in the path of a beam rendered convergent by a
 double convex lens 4 inches in diameter, and possessing a focal
 distance of 10} inches.       The slabs were usually so placed, that
 the focus of parallel rays fell within the ice.        Having first found
 the position of the focus in air, the lens was screened; the ice
 was then placed in position, the screen was removed, and the
 effect was watched through an ordinary pocket lens.
    2. A plate of ice an inch thick, with parallel sides, was first
 examined: on removing the screen the transparent mass was
 crossed by the sunbeams, and the path of the rays through it
 was instantly studded by a great number of little luminous spots,
 produced at the moment and resembling shining air-bubbles.
 When the beam was sent through the edge of the plate, so that
 it traversed a considerable thickness of the ice, the path of the
 beam could be traced by those brilliant spots, as it is by the
floating motes in a dark room.
    3. In lake ice the planes of freezing are easily recognized by
the stratified appearance which the distribution of the air-bubbles
 gives to the mass.       A cube was cut from a perfectly transparent
 portion of the ice, and the solar beam was sent through the cube
 in three rectangular directions successively.           One was perpen
 dicular to the plane of freezing, and the other two parallel to                           it.
The bright bubbles were formed             the ice  in         in     all

little flower-shaped figures. Each flower had six petals; and                              at

    10. This is the result which ought to be expected.          The
volume of water at 32°        being  less than that of ice at the
same temperature, the formation of each flower ought to be
attended with the formation of a vacuum, which disappears in
the manner described when the ice surrounding it is melted.
    Similar experiments were made with ice in which true air
bubbles were enclosed. When the melting liberated the air, the
bubbles rose slowly through the liquid and floated for a time

    13. On the 25th of September, while examining a perfectly
transparent piece of Norway ice, which had not been traversed
by the condensed sunbeams,                      I
                                    found the interior of the mass
crowded with parallel liquid discs, varying in diameter from the
tenth to the hundredth of an inch. These discs were so thin,
that when looked at in section they were reduced to the finest
lines. They had the exact appearance of the circular spots of
oily scum which float on the surface of mutton broth, and in the
pieces of ice first examined they always lay in the planes of
freezing.
    14. As time progressed, this internal disintegration of the ice
appeared to become more pronounced, so that some pieces of
Norway ice, examined in the middle of November, appeared to
be reduced to a congeries of water-cells entangled in a skeleton
of ice. The effect of this was rendered manifest to the hand on
sawing a block of this ice, by the facility with which the saw
went through         it.

means   of observation were fine enough.         The above observations
show that some portions               of    ice melt more readily than

The interior walls of the segments were thickly covered with rich
liquid discs; in some cases the vision plunged unimpeded into
the ice to a depth of several inches, while in others the prismatic
segments were dotted with discs to their very centres.        Fig. 1

represents one of a number of cases of this kind which I had an
opportunity of examining. The network of lines are the inter
sections of the bounding surfaces of the segments with the sur
face of the slab of ice; the short lines in each segment represent
the sections of the discs; and it will be observed that, while in
each single segment their directions are alike, in no two seg
ments is this the case. The flat rings denote that the discs at
these places were parallel to the surface of the ice slab, while in
 all the other cases they were perpendicular                                  to      it.
    18.I   placed this slab               on

   20. What has been already said will prepare us for the consi
deration of an associated class of phaenomena of great physical
interest. The larger masses of ice which I examined exhibited
layers in which bubbles of                   air
                                 were collected    unusual quan                in
tity, marking,            no
                        doubt, the limits                  of

These bubbles were         usually  elongated.      Between two such beds
of  bubbles clear stratum
                 a                    ice intervened; and
                                            of                  clear surface       a
layer, which, from             its
                             appearance, seemed                       to
                                                         have suffered more
from external influences than the rest                          of
                                                    the ice, was associated
with each block.               In
                            this superficial  portion
I  observed detached air-bubbles irregularly
distributed, and, associated with each vesicle
of  air, a  bleb       water which had the ap
                       of
pearance      of a drop         of
                              clear              oil
                                         within the
solid. The adjacent figure will give no                     a
 tion   of these composite cavities: the un
 shaded circle represents the air-bubble, and
 the shaded space adjacent, the water.
    21. When the quantity             water was sufficiently large, which
                                            of
 was  usually   the   case,     turning
                                     on  the ice round, the bubble shifted
 its position, rising always         the topto    the bleb  of water. Some      of
 times, however, the cell was very flat; and the air was then quite
 surrounded          by
                    the liquid.     These composite cells often occurred
in  pellucid ice, which showed inwardly                 other sign   no disin                  of
 tegration.
    This    ismanifestly the same phaenomenon              that which struck
                                                                           as

communicated to the ice during the time occupied in melting a
quantity of the latter equal in volume to the bubble, which time
is stated to be brief; that is to say, the quantity of heat supposed
to be absorbed by the air would, if it had not been communicated
to the ice, have been sufficient to raise the bubble itself to a
temperature 160 times that of fused cast iron.                   Had air this
power of absorption, it might be attended with inconvenient
consequences to the denizens of the earth; for we should dwell

reminded me of the sections of certain agates.                Looked at side

rings of the discs disappeared; the contents seemed to aggregate
so as to form larger liquid spots, and finally, some of them were
reduced to clear transparent discs as before.

  Mr. Harrison, who had devised and perfected a machine for the
  manufacture of ice by the evaporation of aether. I first examined
  a mass of ice of the shape of the frustum of a cone.             The
  diameter of the base was 10} inches, of the top 7% inches, and
  the length of the frustum was 2 feet.        During the freezing of
  this mass a thermometer fixed on the ice showed a temperature
  of 8° below the zero of F., or 40° of F. below the freezing-point
  of water.
     45. Fourteen hours after it had been frozen, the temperature
  of the mass, to a depth of 2 inches below the surface, was accu
  rately 32°F.      At the heart of the frustum the temperature was
  31}”. The superficial portions of the frustum had been the cold
  est, and we see that in fourteen hours the ice of these portions
  rose forty degrees in temperature.
     46. On the 24th of April, Mr. Harrison had the kindness to
 place his excellent machine entirely at my disposition.           The
 vessel which contained the water to be frozen was shaped like
 the inverted frustum of a cone, and was surrounded by a jacket,
 between which and the side of the frustum vaporized aether cir
 culated, the whole being placed in a vessel of water.           At 11
 o'clock A.M., I placed a thermometer (A) in contact with the side
 of the vessel, and about 2 inches below the surface of the water.
 The machine commenced to act, an opalescence was soon obser
 vable on the sides, and after twenty minutes’ action the thermo
 meter was firmly imbedded in the ice.            At 1 o'clock P.M., a
 second thermometer        (B),  placed at a distance of an inch from
 the side of the frustum, was also surrounded by ice. At 2h 20m
 P.M. a third thermometer (C) was placed at a distance of 13 inch
 from the side of the vessel, and at 5h 30m P.M. a fourth thermo
 meter (D) was placed at a distance of 3 inches from the side.
 The observed temperatures of these thermometers at the times
 stated are given in the following Table:–

     At the termination of the experiment the water surrounding
the frustum was at a temperature of 36° F.
     49. These experiments show, that however bad the conduct
ing power of ice, in comparison with other substances, may be,
the assumption that blocks of it which have been preserved in
this country through months of summer weather should still
possess a magazine of cold beyond that due to a temperature of
32°, is wholly incompatible with the physical character of the
 substance.
                                     § VI.
     50. In a very interesting paper communicated to the British
 Association during its last meeting, Mr. James Thomson has
 explained the freezing together of two pieces of ice at 32° in the
 following manner:—“Two pieces of ice, on being pressed toge
 ther at their point of contact, will at that place, in virtue of the
 pressure, be in part liquefied and reduced in temperature, and
 the cold evolved in their liquefaction will cause some of the liquid
 film intervening between the two masses to freeze.”                   I am far
 from    denying    the  operation    under   proper    circumstances of the
 vera causa to which Mr. Thomson refers, but I do not think it
 explains the facts.       For freezing takes place without the inter
 vention of any pressure by which Mr. Thomson’s effect could
  sensibly come into play. It is not necessary to squeeze the
  pieces of ice together; one bit may be simply laid upon the
  other, and they will still freeze.         Other substances besides ice
  are also capable of being frozen to the ice.            If a towel be folded
  round a    piece  of ice at  32°,  they  will freeze together. Flannel
  is still better.    A piece of flannel wrapped round a piece of ice
  freezes to it sometimes so firmly that a strong tearing force is
  necessary to separate both.           Cotton wool and hair may also be
  frozen to ice without the intervention of any pressure which could
  render Mr. Thomson’s cause sensibly active+.                             -
      51. But there is a class of effects to the explanation of which
  the lowering of the freezing-point of water by pressure may,                I
  think, be properly applied. The following statement is true
  of fifty experiments or more made with ice from various quarters.
   A cylinder of ice 2 inches high and an inch in diameter, was
   placed between two slabs of box-wood and submitted to a gra
   dually increasing pressure.        Looked at perpendicular to the axis,
   cloudy lines were seen drawing themselves across the cylinder;
      * It might perhaps be stated generally, that those substances which
   cause the precipitation of water from the gaseous to the liquid state, are
   also most influential in converting the liquid into the solid. “Hemp, wool,
   hair,” are also the substances on which the so-called ground-ice is formed
   most readily.    See Arago’s Report, Annuaire pour l’an 1833.

and when the latter was looked at obliquely, these lines were
found to be the sections of dim hazy surfaces which traversed
the cylinder, and gave it an appearance closely resembling that
of a crystal of gypsum whose planes of cleavage had been forced
out of optical contact by some external force.

effect upon the ice-cylinder was that shown in fig. 5, the       sur
faces being developed along that side which had suffered          the
pressure.

   54. Sometimes the surfaces commence at the centre of the
cylinder.     A dim small spot is first observed, which, as the
pressure continues, expands until it sometimes embraces the
entire transverse section of the cylinder.
   55. On examining these surfaces with a pocket-lens, they ap
peared to me to be composed of very minute water parcels, like
what is produced upon a smooth cold surface by the act of
breathing. Were they either vacuous plates, or plates filled with
air, their aspect would, on optical grounds, be far more vivid
than it really was.
   56. A concave mirror was so disposed, that the diffused light
of day was thrown full upon the cylinder while under pressure.
Observing the expanding surfaces through a lens, they appeared
in a state of intense commotion; this was probably due to the
molecular tensions of the little water parcels.     This motion fol
lowed   closely on the edge  of the surface as it advanced through
the solid ice.   Once or twice   I observed the hazy surfaces pio
neered through the mass by dim offshoots apparently liquid.
They constituted a kind of negative crystallization, having the
exact form of the crystalline spines and spurs produced by the
congelation of water upon a surface of glass.       I have no doubt,
then, that these surfaces are produced by the liquefaction of the
solid in planes perpendicular to the direction of pressure.
   57. The surfaces were developed with great facility where
they corresponded to the surfaces of freezing. Wherever the
liquid discs before described were observed, the surfaces were
always easily developed in the planes of the discs.         By care I
succeeded, in some cases, in producing similar effects in surfaces
at right angles to the planes of the discs, but this was very dif
ficult and uncertain.                                        -

     I
     think the following new facts have been established in the
foregoing paper:—             -
   1. The interior of a mass of ice may be melted by radiant heat
which has passed through exterior portions of the substance
without melting them.
   2. In the dissolution of the ice thus effected, the substance
yields by the formation of liquid spaces, each possessing the
shape of a flower with six petals, a small vacuum being formed
at the centre of each flower.
   3. These flowers are generally formed in planes parallel to the
surface of freezing; but some of the specimens of ice examined
were divided into prismatic segments by surfaces of discontinuity.
Each distinct segment had       own system     its
                                                 flowers arranged           of                              in
parallel planes; but the parallelism did not extend       the flowers                   to
of two distinct segments.    This  subject requires  further investi
gation.

of  ice   32°F. are

the filtrate precipitated by acetate of lead.              The precipitate,
which contains chromate of lead, is treated with nitric acid,
which, when dilute, only dissolves the organic salt. When this
liquid is three-fourths neutralized by ammonia, the salt precipi
tates; when this precipitate is treated with sulphuretted hy
drogen, and the liquid filtered, the acid is obtained in crystalline
plates on evaporating the solution.
    It forms large rhombic crystals, which have a lamellar struc
ture; they are soluble in water, with a strongly acid reaction
and odour. Heated to 100° the acid loses water; at 140° it
melts, and boils at 150° C., disengaging carbonic acid, while
acetic acid distils over.      Treated with sulphuric acid it is decom
posed; and it reduces chloride of gold.
    It forms with potash and ammonia neutral salts, which are
 deliquescent, but crystallize in dry air.          The corresponding acid
 salts are  readily  obtained in     large  crystals.   It precipitates lime,
baryta, and silver salts.
    Its analogies with oxalic acid are manifest. As the latter de
composes into carbonic and formic acids, so malonic acid             decom
 poses into acetic and carbonic acids.

866       Action of Pentachloride of Phosphorus on Aldehyde,
    This action of pentachloride of phosphorus has been tried on
the aldehydes of the fatty acid series.
     By acting on onanthylic aldehyde, Clº Hº"O°, Limprichtk
obtained chloroenanthole,           Equal equivalents of pentachloride
of phosphorus and oenanthole were mixed together and the pro
duct distilled, and the part boiling above 150°C, collected se
parately, This product, washed with water, then shaken with
bisulphite of ammonia, dried and rectified, yielded pure chlor
Qenanthole, C*H*Cl”,            The action was in accordance with the
 equation—
               C14H14 O2+PCl5 =C14H14 Cl2 +PO3 C18.
               (Enanthole.          Chloroenanthole.
It   is a transparent, mobile liquid, lighter than water, and boiling
at 191° C.        Heated with sodium-alcohol in closed tubes to
250° C. it is decomposed into hydrochloric acid, monochlori
nated chloroenanthole, C*H*Cl, which boils at 155°C., and a
hydrocarbon of which the formula is probably C*H*. Treated
with sodium, and then frequently rectified over bright metallic
sodium, chloroenanthole yielded the hydrocarbon C*H*.                 It is
a  liquid   boiling   at 95°, and with a   peculiar  odour.
    Ebersbacht      in a similar manner has obtained the correspond
ing compound C19H19 Cl* from valeraldehyde.               It is a transpa
rent, mobile liquid, with a feeble and not unpleasant odour: it
has the specific      gravity 1-05, is insoluble in water, and boils at
130°. Boiled with alcoholic potash it loses chlorine and yields
the compound C19H8 Cl.
    Geuther<U+017F> examined the action of pentachloride of phosphorus
on common aldehyde.           Aldehyde was added to pentachloride of
           º
phosphorus in a retort which was kept cool, until only a slight
excess of that substance remained; a slight evolution of HCl
took place, arising from the presence of a trace of water in the
aldehyde. On applying heat, the whole dissolved up to a homo
geneous liquid, which on being rectified gradually blackened.
When the temperature had reached 100°C, the receiver was
changed; the distillate which then passed over was oxychlo
ride of                     On mixing the distillate below 100° with
water, an oily body separated, which, when washed, dehydrated
over chloride of calcium and rectified, had the boiling-point 60°C,
The liquid has a sweetish aetherial smell and taste, strongly re
sembling chloroform: at 4° it has the specific gravity 1-9.             It

water-bath in a sealed tube with that substance, chloride of po
tassium was formed, and a volatile chlorine compound, which eva
porated at the warmth of the hand, and burned with a green-edged
flame,
   These three chlorides, from their mode of formation, and
from the regular gradation of their properties as far as they have
been examined, evidently belong to one series.       They are iso
meric with the chlorides of the hydrocarbons, C*H*, but they
are not identical; they differ in the boiling-points and in other
properties. Thus chloride of aethylene boils at 82°C, and is
readily attacked by alcoholic potash; the chloride from aldehyde
boils at 60°C, and is attacked by potash with extreme difficulty,
The difference in boiling-points corresponding to a difference of
C*H* is 19 degrees in the series of chlorides of aethylene and                                            its

the hydrochloric acid continuously evolved from the heated lava,
forms sal-ammoniac. Bunsen had observed, some months after
 an eruption      Hecla, that only the lower part, which had flowed
                     at
over grass-land, showed sal-ammoniac fumaroles, and that higher
up, and       proportion

         sal-ammoniac ceased also.       This theory was opposed by
von Waltershausen, who considered that the volcanic sal-ammo
niac arose from the atmospheric ammonia.
   Ranierit has communicated some observations on the lava
                          1850, which confirm Bunsen’s view.
                                 in                               The

stream      Vesuvius
course      the lava was  partly  over the old stream     1834, partly   of
 (and especially where       reached the plain) over cultivated land.
                                      it
In  the latter portions, sal-ammoniac was found for year and                 a                a
half after the eruption, and        considerable quantities.
                                                    in             the                In
lava which had flowed over the older stream, very little sal
ammoniac was found, and few fumaroles.
   The greater number                          of
                                 fumaroles which occur        the lava           in
which has passed over cultivated land, arises from the gases formed
by   the action           of
                    the lava                     on
                                   organic matter, which force their
way through the still soft lava. And the small quantities                                     of
fumaroles which occur near the older lava may arise from the
decomposition             of
                    accidental animal deposits.
   Ranieri admits that the ammonia          the atmosphere may give

from those of the given system by the ordinary process of elimina
 tion, with a slight modification; the final result being obtained by
 taking the sum of certain numerical multiples (some positive, others
 negative)     of the numbers corresponding to those independent de
 terminations.        This process admits of being applied in a variety of
 modes, the resulting sum of course remaining unaltered in value
 whichever mode is employed, only appearing for each such mode
 made up of a different set of component parts”.
     In   the Problem of the Virgins, where but two equations are
 concerned, the equations are reduced to the standard form when
  the two coefficients of every the same variable in the two equa
 tions are prime to one another, and when no two pairs of coeffi
                                          I
     * Since the above was in print, have discovered a much more specific
 theorem, which, indeed, is to be regarded as the fundamental theorem in
 the doctrine of compound partition, and the basis of that given in the text.
  It is as follows:—If there be r simultaneous simple equations between n
 variables (in which the coefficients are all positive or negative integers)
jorming a definite system (i.e. one in which no variable can become indeft
 nitely great in the positive direction without one or more of the others be
  coming    negative), and  if the r coefficients belonging to each of the same
 variable are   exempt  from a factor    common to them all, and if not more than
 r—l of the variables can be eliminated simultaneously between the r equa
  tions, then the determination of the number of positive integer solutions of
  the given system may be made to depend on like determinations for each of n
  derived independent systems, in each of which the number of variables and
  equations is one less than in the original system.
     This reduction in general can be effected in a great but limited variety
  of modes. When only two equations, however, are concerned, the number
  of modes is always two, neither more nor less. So that in fact we are still
  navigating in the narrows, and have not fairly entered upon the wide ocean
  of the theory of compound partitions until we have passed the case of
  double partition. When the given system supposed definite is one of three
  equations between four variables, the number of modes of reduction is
  twelve or sixteen, according to that type out of two (to one or the other
  of which it must of necessity belong) under which the system falls. The
  theory of types applicable to any system of simultaneous simple equations
  with rational coefficients, here faintly shadowed forth, constitutes,  I appre
  hend, a new and important branch in the theory of inequalities.

374        Pror. Sylvesteron the Problem of the Virgins,
cients have the same ratio; and for this problem the process is
always limited to only two modes of application.           The method,
however, in a very     important  class of cases admits of being ap
plied in one, and only one mode when these conditions are not
strictly fulfilled.
   Thus the virgins who appeared to Euler, but with their forms
muffled and their faces veiled, have not disdained to reveal
themselves to me under their natural aspect. Wonderful indeed
has been the history of this theory of partitions.       Notwithstand
ing that the immortal Euler had written two elaborate memoirs
on the subject, that Paoli, and                      I
                                     believe other Italian mathema
ticians, had taken it up from another but less advantageous point
of view, so completely had it fallen into oblivion, as far as the
mathematicians of this country are concerned, that Sir John
 Herschel has written a memoir upon            inserted       the Philo it,              in
sophical Transactions, without any reference to, and evidently                                                 in

THE“On     following communications were read:—
                the probable Origin of some Magnesian         Rocks.”     By
T. Sterry Hunt, Esq., of the    Geological Survey      of Canada.
   The deposits of mineral matters from natural waters offer many
points of interest to the geologist. Besides the rock-salt and gypsum,
which in many cases have doubtless been formed by the spontaneous
evaporation of saline waters, it is well known that many mineral
springs charged with carbonic acid under pressure, deposit great
quantities of earthy salts when they come to the surface, and that
the travertines thus formed often constitute extensive masses.          The
deposit from the hot alkaline saline springs of Carlsbad, which forms
greatbeds, was found by Berzelius to consist chiefly of carbonate of lime,
with portions of oxide or carbonate of iron, and small quantities of
silica, strontia, phosphoric acid and fluorine; the analyses of other
chemists have added to the list of elements met with in these and
similar precipitates, manganese, zinc, cobalt, nickel, chromium, arsenic,
antimony, tin, copper and lead. Carbonate of magnesia is however
wanting, or present only in very small proportion, in these deposits;
and the same is true of the calcareous sinter from cold springs.        The
Carlsbad water, however, contains for 17 parts of carbonate of lime
10 parts of carbonate of magnesia; but this latter salt, according to         .
Berzelius, is only deposited after evaporation.
    The analyses by Berzelius and Struve of the various carbonated
waters of Germany, show that carbonate of lime is generally present
in much larger quantities than carbonate of magnesia; and it is only
in the waters of Püllma and the Elisenbrunnen of Kreuznach, which
contain very little carbonic acid, that we find a large amount of
carbonate of magnesia, with a small portion of carbonate of lime.
The water of Püllna, according to Struve, contains in 1000 parts
32:72 of solid matters, consisting of sulphates and chlorides of sodium,
m=3p-H1 and m-3p-H2.          The adjacent curves have, so to say, in the
instance above, the same tangents and circles of curvature at the points of
union, so that we may be said to modulate from one formula into another.
The raison raisonnée of this fact is easily explicable on a priori analytical
principles.

carbonic acid is much less than is required to form bicarbonates
with the soda, lime and magnesia which these waters contain, so that
the magnesia must be held dissolved as a mono-carbonate.                 In the
water of Chambly, on the contrary, there is no deficiency of carbonic
acid, and the bases exist as bicarbonates. The temperatures of these
springs range from 46° to 53° F.; some of them are therefore to be
regarded as slightly thermal.
    Interstratified with the shales and sandstones of the Quebec divi
sion of the Lower Silurian rocks, which immediately overlie the
strata yielding these alkaline waters, are found thick beds of pure
limestone, sometimes presenting the agatized structure and semi
translucency which characterize certain travertines, but at other
times opake, homogeneous, and including remains of orthoceratites,
trilobites and other fossils.     Associated with these beds of pure car
bonate of lime are others which are magnesian, and contain con
siderable quantities of carbonate of iron, which causes them to
weather reddish brown.         These beds are always granular in texture,
and contain a variable portion of siliceous sand; they often become
conglomerate, enclosing pebbles of quartz and schist, or more fre
quently fragments of a pure compact limestone, seemingly identical
with that of the beds just described. Thin layers of the ferruginous
magnesian rock sometimes separate beds of the pure carbonate of lime,
or form lenticular masses in                 its
                                     midst, and seem       replace            to

occur     inirregular and interrupted beds; they often attain            thick                     a

matron   lakes of Hungary and Egypt, to produce deposits of magne
sian carbonate.
   The conditions of these deposits at Pointe-Lévis and elsewhere in
the Quebec group, seem to point to the existence of basins along an
ancient sea-shore, which probably marked the first upheaval of the
older Silurian strata.   Beds of travertine were there formed, and
then the sea flowed over these deposits and gave rise to the fossili
ferous limestones; but there were intervals of disturbance, indicated
by the conglomerates, and these movements, or the deposition of bars
along the shore, gave rise to lagoons or basins cut off from the sea,
where, by evaporation under the conditions which we have supposed,
magnesian precipitates would be deposited. The absence of fossils
in these beds is probably connected with the peculiar composition of
the waters.

venenifera.”     By Professors A. Kölliker of Würzburg, and E. Peli
kan of St. Petersburgh.
   The famous poison-tree of Madagascar was described for the first
time by Aubert du Petit Thouars in his ‘Genera Madagascarensia,”
under the name of Tanghinia venenifera.          At a later period, Sir W.
Hooker    published a good  description, with a figure of this tree, named
by him Cerbera Tanghin (see Botanical Magazine, pl. 2968); so that
nothing is wanted with regard to the botanical knowledge of this
plant. On the other hand, the physiological effects of            poisonous                      its
parts have not been hitherto investigated.       All we know       that the                          is,

contracted and very small, whilst the auricles remained dilated, but
were also paralysed.

paralysis      the heart, they became weaker and weaker, and gradually
                 of

386                                   Royal Society:—
direct to the ear, I propose to give the results of experiments made
with an instrument which I have invented for hearing with both
ears respectively, and which, as it is specially adapted for the auscul
tation of differences in the sounds of different parts of the chest,  I
have named the Differential Stethoscope, or Stethophone.
    The results thus procured will be more satisfactory than those ob
tained by ordinary audition; a sound will be increased as a visual
object is magnified by the microscope, and as both ears are similarly
 dealt with, a perfect parity of conditions will hold in respect of
both ears.
  The differential stethophone (see figure) is simply an instrument con
sisting of two hearing-tubes, or trumpets, or stethoscopes, provided
 with collecting-cups and ear-knobs, one for each ear respectively. The
 two tubes are, for convenience, mechanically combined, but may
be said to be acoustically separate, as care is taken that the sound,
once admitted into one tube, is not communicated to the other. The
tubes are composed of two parts nearly equal in length, one near the
 ear-knob, made of metal (C); while the other part, near the collecting
 cup, is made of metal wire (B), to impart
flexibility. The ear-end is curved, so as
to approach the ear, and is supplied with
 an ivory knob (D) for insertion into the
meatus externus.       The other end of the
tube, being intended to collect sound, is
 supplied with a hollow cup, or receiver(A)
made of wood, or some such material.
The mechanical construction of this in
 strument is borrowed from the stetho
scope contrived by Dr. Caman of New
York, and intended by                 its
                                inventor for
the purpose         hearing with both ears
                       of
 sounds emanating from one point, and
collected into one cup.       The two tubes
are brought near together,        few inchesa
in  front    of
              the face,     means
                                 by      con    of   a
necting-bar (E), but calculated      prevent    to
the transmission            of
                      sound from one tube                  to
the other.     This bar     supplied with
                                 is                        a
joint, which permits the tubes         freely
                                            to   be
 moved,      as  necessary
                  is           applying the
                                      in
knobs       to
            the ears.    The two knobs are
kept steadily         in
                   the ears     means  by             of   an
elastic band (F) connecting the two tubes
near the bar, already described.

ears, with the knobs directed upwards,
and the cups being applied equally near

both ears, as in ordinary hearing. But if one cup be removed a little,
say a half or a quarter of an inch from the watch (for we shall now
adopt it), and the other cup be left upon the watch, the sound is heard
with that ear only which is connected with the cup placed upon the
watch, and the sensation in the hearing ear is so marked, as to leave
the mind in no doubt whatever that it is through that ear we become
conscious of the sound.     If the cup placed upon or nearer the watch,
be removed a little further than the other cup, so as to be less favour
ably situated for collecting sound, say one inch from the watch, the
ear connected with it becomes totally unconscious of sound, and the
sensation of hearing is most unequivocally felt in the ear (and in that
ear only) which but a moment before was utterly deaf to                one                                            it.    If

        be                               the watch, and the other                                                            on
edge, the watch sound                             only

   These experiments may            thus varied; and the result will
                                                          be                                                                       in

direction of the same sound, with more accuracy than could be done
had a judgment to be formed between the intensity of two similar
sensations in the two ears respectively.              All source of error is
removed by there being only one sensation, although there may be
two impressions.        This law of a stronger impression in one ear,
rendering us unconscious of a weaker but similar impression in the
other, has an analogue, though perhaps an imperfect one, in the
sense of touch.       Very strong impressions upon one part of the
body cause such acute sensations, that minor impressions of the
same kind upon another part are frequently not felt, in fact, produce
no sensation.
   The only observations bearing upon this law which                 have been             I
able to discover, are some by Mr. Wheatstone, in a paper entitled

from the same region or surface, for the sides of the head can be

by placing one arm of the stethophone on the chest and the other
 upon the veins.
   When the respiration in two parts is alike in character, but de
cidedly louder in one part than in another, the sound in the weak side
is lost. While this loss proves, in a very emphatic manner, the im
portant fact of deficiency, it of course for the time deprives us of the
opportunity of judging of the quality of the deficient inspiration: but
this is readily obviated by removing the cup of the instrument from
the full respiring part; and then the deficient respiration is immediately
heard through the other cup.         Thus, while the two sounds, being
of like character, and one being more intense than the other, can
be heard only in one ear at the same time, an admirable opportu
nity is obtained for contrasting the extent, and some of the qualities,
of the sounds of the two parts, by placing the cups alternately and
rapidly upon the two spots respectively. Vocal extussive resonance
in two parts of the thorax, is well contrasted with the two tubes
employed at once, or in immediate succession.
   The sounds of the two sides of the heart, and of the valves of the
two great arteries proceeding from that organ, are, by means of the
stethophone, very advantageously dealt with.           By placing it over
the two sides of the   heart, or the  origin of the two arteries, we ascer
tain the character and loudness of the sounds of these parts.           One
cup being placed over the aorta, and the other over the pulmonary
artery, if the sounds they collect differ in character, one sound is
heard in one ear, and another in the other ear. We may have at the
same moment an aortic murmur and a healthy pulmonary artery
sound, one sound in one ear, and another sound in the other ear. But
when it is desired to listem to each sound singly and in succession,
the instrument will still be available; for the cups may be applied
singly and in succession, thus affording ample means for contrast.
   In cases of disordered heart, in which it is desired to discover
whether the sounds of the two sides of the heart are synchronous, the
stethophone affords the most satisfactory mode of investigating the
fact. With         it,
                 we virtually place our two ears over the two sides      the                of
heart; and       one side sounds
                   if                all after the other, the fact
                                                at                     made            is
known, and the end                of
                           one sound and the beginning          another are      of
clearly and distinctly defined. With the ordinary stethoscope this                               is
impossible; for where one sound heard, the other may
                                                 is               inaudible,      be

   In connexion with that part of my paper which treats of the re
striction of hearing to the closed ear, I desire to add the fact which
I  have ascertained within the last few days, that if one ear be closed
                                                                                                                              by

boulders were   originally  brought across the Valley     Kashmir from                                   of
Haramuk by ice        some other transporting agency, but the author

 896                        Geological Society —
 observed no trace of such fragments along the supposed line of
 transport, except at the isolated localities above-mentioned.          In
 pursuing his journey up the Jhelum by Baramula and Sopur
 through North Kashmir to the North Punjal Range, which he was
 occupied in surveying, the author was enabled to study the nature
 of the great alluvial deposits of Kashmir, constituting a formation
 of great thickness, and of which the Karéwah Hills, sometimes up
 wards of 300 feet in height, are formed.             This alluvium or
 “Karéwah formation” is believed by Mr. H. Godwin-Austen to be
purely of lacustrine origin. He found that it is always composed
of detritus of local origin, containing granitic, basaltic, or calcareous
 fragments, according to the nature of the mountains in the back
 ground, from which the materials had been derived; and that the
 coarser constituents lie near the mountains, whilst finer and finer
 detritus is discernible in the beds towards the plains. Subsequently
 examining the heights above the Jhelum outside the Baramula
 Pass, the author found the granitic rocks in place from whence the
 granite-boulders of the valley-deposits at Kuthai, Oorie, and Gingle
 had been derived.       A journey through the Valley of Kashmir, past
 the old buried    city, and by Islamabad and Shahbad, to survey the
 country traversed by the Chunab and Kishtwar Rivers, and over
 looked by the Brahma Mountain, 22,000 feet high, still further
 illustrated the author's views of the local origin of the great alluvial
 or lacustrine deposits of the country,    which, whether formed in the
 outer and smaller basins, or in the great Kashmir Valley, appear to
 have been the slow result of atmospheric agencies, operating on this
 very ancient land, from the time of its first exposure as a highly
 dislocated tract of tertiary and secondary strata entangled in an
 irregular trough or basin of crystalline and granitic rocks, until the
period when the gradual disintegration of the surface had filled up
the step-like cavities with local lacustrine deposits.      Subsequently
the    drainage of the  country has not  only shaped the Karéwah Hills
 out of these sediments, but has cut through these deposits, often
 deep into the underlying rock, and, clearing out the gravels and
boulders from the choked gorges of the Jhelum at Baramula, has
reduced the waters of the old lake of Kashmir to its present narrow
limits. Hence the buried condition of the old city and its temple,
and other local phaenomena, may be accounted for, without recourse
being had to the supposition of successive subsidences and upheavals
which has been sometimes advanced.

By the Rev. S. Haughton, F.G.S.
    The black mica accompanying the white margarodite of the
Leinster granite, similar mica at Ballyellin, Carlow, and the black
mica found in the Poisonglen, leading to the pass of Ballygihen, in
Donegal, have been carefully examined by the author, and he regards
the black mica of Donegal as certainly identical with that of Carlow
and Leinster, and probably the same as the black mica from Peters
berg, Wermland, described as Lepidomelane by Soltmann.

   In a cutting of the Banff and Turriff Railway, about four miles to
the north of Turriff, there has been exposed a thick mass of tenacious
blue clay, containing Ammonites, Belemnites, Gryphaeae, Plagiosto
mata, and other fossils of Liassic character.
   The author explained his reasons for regarding this clay as being
a fragment of the Lias in situ, and noticed the interest belonging to
it as being perhaps the most eastern Liassic outlier in Scotland.

   By the examination of a series of mammalian fossils sent from
the Condamine River and Darling Downs, and now in the Worcester
Museum, and of casts of the cranium, upper jaw, and teeth of
Macleay's “Zygomaturus,” communicated by the Trustees of the
Sydney Museum, Professor Owen has been able to demonstrate that
this cranium belongs, as he suggested in a paper lately read before
the Society, to his genus Nototherium, and to the species which he
had dedicated to the late Sir T. Mitchell.      A smaller species, pro
visionally named Nototherium inerme, was also established by Pro
fessor Owen on some of the specimens examined; but he thinks it
not improbable that with additional materials it might be found that
these two forms may represent the male and female of one species.

   These fossils were found by Mr. Brown in a small exposure of sand
and clay beds, in a garden on a hill-side in the parish of Chislet,
Kent. The beds would appear, according to Mr. Prestwich's sec
tions of that county, to belong to his “Lower London Tertiaries;”
but of the 36 species of Shells, Cirripeds, and Foraminifera met
with—13 are forms found also in the Crag ; 9 are English Lower
Tertiary forms; 2 are Belgian Tertiary forms; and 4 are new species.

lens of long focus, so that Fraunhofer's lines were visible on a
paper screen. When the paper covered with the platinocyanide of
barium was substituted for the ordinary paper screen, nearly the
 whole portion on which the blue rays fell appeared of an unaltered
 blue colour; but in this blue part of the spectrum, three isolated
 green fluorescent bands appeared.          One of these fluorescent bands
 falls with its middle upon Fraunhofer's line G ; the other two lie
between G and F, and the middle of these bands corresponds with
the wave-lengths 0.000462, 0-000446, and 0.000430 millim.                The
rays of light of the lengths of undulations just mentioned conse
quently produce a green fluorescence upon platinocyanide of barium;
 whilst the intervening lengths of undulations, 0-000454 and 0.000438
millim., as well as rays of the length of undulation,0-000420 millim.,
produce no fluorescence upon this substance.
    An uninterrupted green fluorescence only begins at that spot of
the spectrum which nearly corresponds with a length of undulation
of 0.000410 millim.        I am unacquainted with any analogous phae
nomenon.—Poggendorff’s Annalen, 1858, No. 8, p. 649.
ON    THE INCREASE OF THE EI,ECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THE
        METALS WITH THE TEMPERATURE.                B.Y. R. CLAUSIU.S.
    In the May Number of Poggendorff's Annalen there is an interesting
memoir by Arndtsen upon the resistance of metals at various tem
peratures, in which the author arrives at the result, that in the
 simple metals investigated by him, with the exception of iron, the
resistance increases uniformly with the temperature, and moreover,
that the proportional increase in the different metals varies but little.
If the resistance at the freezing-point be called 100, the numbers
representing the increase for 1°C. (1°8 F.) in the six simple metals
investigated, lie, with the exception of iron, between 0.327 and
 0.413*; and Arndtsen adds, that if absolutely pure metals were
 employed, and the investigations were carried on still more carefully,
perfectly accordant numbers would probably be obtained.
    On glancing at these numbers, it struck me that they closely
approach the coefficients of expansion of permanent gases.             If we
leave out of consideration the quadratic member occurring in iron,
and take the mean of the whole of the first coefficients, we obtain
for the resistance w! at the temperature t, compared with the resistance
w" at the freezing-point, the formula
                           wº-w"(1+0.00366.       tº),         -
from which it would follow that the resistance of the simple metals
in the solid state is nearly in proportion to the absolute temperature.
    Although the number of metals investigated by Arndtsen is still
too small, and the agreement of the numbers too imperfect to enable
us to arrive at a safe conclusion, still I think that this observation
may perhaps be of some interest, and furnish an inducement to
further investigations.—Poggendorff’s Annalen, 1858, No. 8. p. 650.
   * The numbers found by Matthiessen for potassium and sodium in the
solid state also fall between these limits.

       is not many days since had the opportunity of seeing for
       the first time the Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
for January 9, 1857, which contain a paper with the following
title, “An Examination of the Figure of the Indian Meridian as
 deduced by Archdeacon Pratt from the two Northern Indian
Arcs; with a proposition for testing that form by Astronomical
Observations, by Lieut. J. F. Tennant, Bengal Engineers,
F.R.A.S.;” and also a continuation of that paper, read before
the Astronomical Society in June of last year by the same author.
The calculation here referred to by Mr. Tennant was made by
me while at the Cape of Good Hope in 1854, and is published
in the Philosophical Transactions of the following year. As the
calculations and results of that paper do not appear to have
been altogether understood by Mr. Tennant,                    I
                                                    trouble you with
these remarks”.

an oblate spheroid of ellipticity about gig.          This has been
arrived at   by  four distinct  processes.   (1) Upon  the hypothesis
that the earth was once     fluid, and  by assuming a (very probable)
law of density of     its

402                       Archdeacon Pratt on the Figure                         of
as above.   (2) By pendulum experiments made in many parts
of the earth it is gºath. (3) From the effect of the protuberant
parts of the earth’s mass on the motion of the moon in latitude
and longitude, Laplace made the depression very slightly less
than sºuth. (4) By the measurement of arcs of meridian in
different parts of the world and observing the latitudes of their
 *xtremities, and comparing arcs in high latitudes with arcs in
low latitudes (which has always been considered necessary to
  'iminate certain errors of observation), the depression has
i.     found to be slightly less than 5% oth of the equatorial
raCIlus.
   3. But it will be observed that these methods        regard the                        all
earth,     whole: they
          as   a            not determine anything regarding the

separate parts.   Indeed,      have already intimated,
                                            as  I         has long                              it
been   acknowledged   that the fourth method     fails, when arcs
near each other, and therefore appertaining      one portion only               to
of  the earth's surface, are compared.        The fact        that phy                     is,
sical and  practical geology  teach us,  that the surface      the earth                     of
has for ages been undergoing changes            level    such      of
                                                                 way                 in           a   as

              very  great,      proof  that ages must have elapsed

how does       testhe      Not   it                 by
                                     examining my calculation, but
by  comparing my result with the curvature              other arcs: (1)         of
with the prolongation         the arc down of       Punnae (north lat.  to

Kalianpur        is,
               Karachi.     The   only  question,  therefore, which                                   he
can solve
                    to
              whether his arcs and mine belong              one and the               to
same spheroid        not; not whether my calculation
                            or                                   right                         is     or

                                       the Indian Meridian.                                           403
wrong*.   He also applies a third test, viz. a comparison of
the computed and observed azimuth of Kalianpur and Karachi.
But the same objection applies to this also. His process goes
wholly upon the untenable hypothesis, that every meridian is an
ellipse and the same ellipse, and that every arc of longitude is
circular.
    5. There are other indications that Mr. Tennant has taken a
wrong view of the subject. For example (paragraph 13), “The
attraction is so enormous, if Mr. Pratt's values hold good near
the mountains . . . . . . ”                               I
                               But particularly specify, and the
whole line of  reasoning shows,  that my calculation is not made
for such places (see p. 66, note, of my paper). And in the con
tinuation of the note in the next three pages,    point out a me               I
thod for   places in and near the    mountains;  so that the wish
expressed by Mr. Tennant in paragraph 17 was met in the paper
before him, viz.             “If
                      an estimate of the attraction at Benog [in
the mountains] could be made . . . . .” Then in Mr. Tennant's
 second paper, there are other expressions which show that he
 has mistaken the matter.           He says, “Mr. Pratt has failed in
 satisfying the geodesical data of the great longitudinal series.”
 But I did not make the attempt. Mr. Tennant must mean that,
 on applying my calculation to the great longitudinal series, he
 failed to show that the results tally, on the supposition that the
 earth’s figure is a perfect spheroid. This is what should have                     I
 expected, and quite confirms my general view.            He says, further
 on,  “It   [the ellipticity                I
                                 deduce for the great arc of 800 miles
 long] is useless for geodesical purposes.”         Of course it       the                      is,
                                                                                                  if
 geodesical operations are carried          with          on
                                                      assumed,  and most an
 probably wrong, ellipticity.           the mean ellipticity
                                                     If            not the                   be
right one for that arc, then not that ellipticity, but some other,
ought      to    be
                 used        computing the latitudes

                            arc, otherwise the  geodesical  operations                                 of
the Great Survey will           “useless” for the purpose
                                        be                       attaining

I  have read through both Mr. Tennant's papers and his interest

results    of my paper, for the reason          have stated.   IThe only
method will            point

or   to discover some other cause     which,     calculation,   onfound                   is           to
nullify mountain-attraction.

                        In
                        my paper            the Phil. Trans.
                   of   1855,I        show that the deflec

tion of the plumb-line at stations between C and A, caused
by H, varies inversely as the distance from a certain point Q
about 260 miles north of A or Kaliana, and that at a distance
of 1000 miles it equals 7".235. Mr. Tennant makes use of this
law to determine the effect the mountain-attraction has in alter
ing the curve of level.   He calculates it from the equator (sup
posing that my law extends so far), and shows that the curve
ascends continually higher and higher; so that Oc b a being the
curve as affected by mountain-attraction, O'c'b'a' is the curve
which would mark the level if H did not exist.          Mr. Tennant
makes ce'-327 feet.      This is not to be depended    upon,  because
it is calculated on the assumption that my law applies between
the equator and C, which is not proved.       The other results are
correct, viz. that, if c de be drawn parallel to c'b'a', d b-98,
and ea-271 feet.
   These measures enable me to show that c b a and c de cannot
both be portions of ellipses of the kind described.         For when
two concentric and coaxial    ellipses of small ellipticity  cut each
other in a point of which l is the latitude in either ellipse, the
distance between the ellipses at another point of which X is the
latitude =# c(cos 21– cos 2X), where c is the difference of the
minor axes.     Hence if both the curves are ellipses,
                   T*
        bd would           36°6' 30" — cos 48° 14' 22"

        age            cos 36° 6' 30"      –
                                       cos 59° 1736'<U+017F>
                                                       =0:48,
               -   •       98
whereas this ratio     =         =0'36.
                           37I
   Itis clear that, if either be elliptic, it must be c de, which is
that obtained by eliminating the effect of H; and the curve c b a
cannot be elliptic, as assumed in the Great Survey.
   This shows the absolute necessity of calculating and allowing
for mountain-attraction.          If
                                after making this allowance the
curve does not become part of the mean ellipse, it shows that
there is some other cause of derangement which we have not de
tected.
   7. There is another point           I   would mention as occurring to
me.   We have been accustomed to think that, however much the
contour of the continents may vary and depart from the mean
form, the ocean must possess that figure. But I infer from the
following approximate calculation that this is not certainly the
CaSe.
  I  have shown that the Himalayan attraction may fairly be
considered to vary inversely as the distance from Q for      sta  all
tions between   andA     Beyond
                           C.       the law has not been
                                           C             proved.
In  fact  it  clear that, from that point southwards, the attrac

the attraction of a long uniform prism upon a point opposite
middle equals the mass        the prism divided

the point's distances from the middle and either              extremi                            of   its
ties.     therefore the point
         If                        near (compared with the prism’s
                                                           be
length), the force will nearly vary inversely      the distance; but                   as
if  it   be
        more   distant, the force will approach    much more       the                                        to

              behaviour towards
                       from the                        negative electrode, spreads out
in all directions, is so remarkable that I shall in the first place
recur to it again. We can best illustrate this behaviour by con
sidering the well-known fact, that when iron filings are strewn
upon a piece of stiff paper covering the pole of a magnet, they
arrange themselves in curves which have been called magnetic
curves, or lines of magnetic force. Such curves render the dis
tribution of the power of a magnet visible even when analysis is
unable to determine their form.    In every such curve the sepa
rate particles of iron having, under the influence of the magnet,
become themselves little magnets, arrange themselves with their
attracting poles together so as to form a chain. Could we remove
the particles of iron from the influence of gravitation and distri
bute them through the whole space surrounding the magnetic
pole, then such chains assuming the form of magnetic curves
would traverse the whole magnetic field, and furnish a visible
image of the distribution of the magnetic force. The links of
every chain would be in a condition of stable equilibrium; every
portion of every chain, if removed by an external force from                              its
position, would, when left         itself, return to  its original place
                                                                      to
again.     Never more than one single magnetic curve passes
through      given point; and the position which any one link

   53. The colour of the magnetic light appears to depend upon
the nature of the gas in the tube. This light is in most cases
violet, of a more or less red tinge; it is often accompanied by an
intense green light (35); frequently it is of a beautiful blue;
and under otherwise unfavourable circumstances                    I
                                                      have observed
an intense yellow flame of magnetic light.
   Hitherto we have assumed the use of platinum electrodes. In
the phaenomena under consideration, the nature of the metal of
the electrode appears nevertheless to exert no influence.         have      I
already mentioned the apparently perfect similarity in the beha
viour of strongly coppered, silvered, and gilded platinum elec
trodes (37). A sewing-needle as negative electrode gave the
same appearance, as also electrodes of lead and tin.              (The
portion of the electrode fused into the glass can of course be
nothing but platinum.       The metal under investigation was fast
ened   appropriately  to the platinum.)
    54. From these experiments we are, it seems, justified in con
cluding that the diamagnetic or paramagnetic nature of the par
ticle torn from the electrode need not be taken into account in
considering the magnetic light.             If,

of the varied nature          of
                           the phaenomena which          offers.   These   it

                                          in                      several                 of

The middle piece is connected with the end ones by means of
two tubes of different diameter, the narrower being a rather wide
thermometer-tube.
   64. One of the tubes just described contained fluoride of sili
cium. The electrical light-stream was diffused through the wide
middle cylinder with a faded colour, while the light in the con
necting tubes was far more intense, and more intense in the
narrower than in the wider of these tubes. In the bulb contain
ing the negative electrode, a beautiful atmosphere of magnetic
light was diffused.
   65. On bringing the hand towards the middle cylinder, the
light was deviated even while the hand was at a considerable
distance.  On touching the cylinder with the finger, the light
was sometimes attracted to the point touched; sometimes it was
repelled from this point, the light-current in the cylinder being
broken by dark strata. On inverting the Ruhmkorff’s apparatus,
an inversion of the phaenomena invariably occurred.
   The very remarkable phaenomena described would be contra
dictory if everything had been symmetrical on both sides of the
middle cylinder. The free tension at the two ends of the induc
tion wire is very different; but it is easy to convince oneself that
the cause could not consist in this. Nothing therefore remained
but to seek the cause in the difference of width of the two con
necting tubes; and it was actually found that the light in the
middle cylinder was either attracted or repelled by the hand, accord
ing as the positive light-current passed into this cylinder by the
wider or narrower of the connecting tubes.

a  prism at a tube which showed clearly the black lines of Ruhm

                                  trying the first Geissler tubes                 in

                           this town (Bonn).       convinced myself

gases       vapours which they contain.
           or                                All these spectra have
this  in common, that the colours                  do
                                         not merge into one another

also divided into well-defined    lighter  and darker strips.   Each
gas, moreover, has         a   characteristic      spectrum.

The eye perceives, for instance, in one part of the tube red, in
another violet, and in the middle cylinder a fainter colour; so
that one would be inclined to imagine that the ponderable matter
which becomes luminous is differently distributed through the tube.
In addition to this, it happens in many cases that the colour of
the electric light undergoes a change in        passage through the         its

 which five    bright  bands       almost    of
                                            equal   breadth were especially

as from   D;   finally, a beautiful yellow band, E. Of the three
bands in the green, D is especially bright, being of a yellowish
tinge; then follows C in respect of intensity, and finally B.
The red is very prominent, spreading over an extensive surface.
A well-defined thick black line occurs near its further boundary.
On the other side it is sharply separated from the yellow band
E by a broad black line: the whole of the yellow light is con
centrated upon this band.         The band D is separated from the
band E      by  a  grey   interval,  almost equal in breadth to that
separating D and       3.   The violet light is confined to the band
A. The space between A and B is divided into a completely
black space, and one of an indefinite dark colour. The black
space sharply bounding band A, is about three times as broad
as each of the five bright equally broad bands, and about a
third of the breadth of the whole space between A and B, or
between B and D.
   71. As another example,           I  shall take the beautiful spec
trum of    gaseous   fluoride of boron as one totally different from
that   just  described.     In this spectrum, which shows bright
colours from one extremity to the other, red, together with
orange and yellow, takes up about a fifth of the whole space; of
the other four-fifths, two are occupied by the green, and the
remainder by the violet. It is remarkable that the eye does
not perceive any transition between the violet and the green,
the blue appearing to be entirely wanting. Yellow and orange
form two sharply bounded bright bands of about equal breadth,
both together being about half as wide as the red, from which
the orange is separated by a strong black line. Near the
boundary of the red there is a second such black line. The
space of the red between these two black lines is divided into
six equal parts by five fine black lines; and on the other side of
the strong black line first mentioned, there is in the orange and
yellow also the same number of fine black lines at the same
distance from one another.           In the green, about twice as far
from the violet as from the         yellow  boundary, there is a bright
green band about as broad as the yellow band. This green
band divides the green space into two parts, which differ im
portantly from one another. That part which lies next to the
yellow, has in the middle a bright shining band; and the green
on either side of this band is not uniform, for it becomes con
tinually darker towards        its  two extremities.    The remaining
portions  of   the green and     of   the violet have quite     charac
                                                                 a
teristic appearance.        This space appears divided into sixteen
bands, ten     of which belong       tothe violet.  Each separate band
is bright towards the red, becoming gradually darker                 in
                                                                    the
opposite direction. The breadth            of these bands    not quite
                                                            is

uniform; they are broadest towards the middle of the violet.
The broadest of these bands is on the one side of a bright
shining violet; on the other side it is completely black. At
this part the spectrum presents in the telescope the appearance
of a strongly illuminated fluted column.
   72. For the present I shall confine myself to the description
of these two spectra. The most difficult question which arises
on the discharge of electricity through rarefied gases, is the che
mical nature of the ponderable substance which gives rise to so
infinitely varied phaenomena of light. This question can only be
safely discussed in connexion with the prismatic analysis of the
light which is produced,—the more so as by this means every
sudden or gradual chemical change in the substance is recognized.
    73. In confirmation of this assertion I shall adduce the follow
ing example.     It appeared to me to be eminently desirable to
determine the spectrum of oxygen gas, and to draw           like the                       it,
 other  spectra,    colours. M.

               of                          the oxygen. The pale

                                                   In

through the tube began                discontinuous, till

spectrum is probably to be attributed to the traces of some other
gas not entirely driven out of the tube, making their effects felt.
Decisive experiments have still to be tried concerning this point.
After the complete disappearance of the free oxygen gas, the tube
contains too little gas to admit the passage of the stream, in
complete accordance with the older experiments of Mr. Faraday,
and the later ones of M. Masson: the interior of the tube behaves
as a complete and non-conducting vacuum.
   Before the entire extinction of the current in the tube,       in                                 I
vain  endeavoured, by inverting the poles, to restore the continuity
of the discharge.   By such inversion, the bulb about the nega
tive pole became filled with the already mentioned enigmatical
beautiful green light (35); but this light was also extinguished
as soon as the current ceased to pass through the tube.
   The current had passed through the tube altogether for about
1} hour.
  74.       I
          shall here break off, because, apart from the chemical
question, investigations of the spectra of different gases cannot
have the requisite degree of accuracy.   These spectra are essen
tially different from those belonging to the electrical arch of light
in the air, and from metals glowing or burning in                doubt                   it.   I

a transmitted beam can be made by an opake screen, and so a
beam of plane-polarized light can be obtained. When the com
mon double-image rhomb is placed in the same manner before
the eye, no boundaries of total reflexion are seen.
    I  have tried the rhomb above named, with air between the
component prisms, in various experiments where Nicol's rhomb
would generally be used, and found it succeed; amongst others,
I   have used it as polarizer and analyser in the microscope:
 but   I  have not found any advantages to recommend it in
 preference to Nicol's rhomb, except a saving of the material,
 calc-spar; and the smallness of the angle gives some disadvan
tages.     The only cases in which it would have a decided advan
 tage, are those    in which it was proposed 4 to be used where a
 large breadth of pencil was required with small angular diver
 gence or convergence; and then convergence in the transmitted
 beam may be produced by a convex lens.              In this way an ana
 lyser may be formed so as to throw images of selenite designs
 upon a screen for exhibition to a number of persons better than
 by any other method for brightness and distinctness; and there
 may be found other peculiar cases where it would have an ad
 vantage over other rhombs.

       HE   difference in the appearance of a lot of Chinese coins
          which were lately offered for sale in this city by a native
  of the Celestial Empire, and the little knowledge which we have
  on the subject of Chinese metallurgy, suggested the idea that,
  by a careful examination      of the different kinds, some new and
  serviceable   alloys  might   be added to those already used in the
  arts, or, at least, that by such an investigation some informa
  tion might be obtained of the Chinese ores, and the manner
  of their reduction. With the exception of three or four alloys,
  which have been repeatedly analysed, we know hardly anything
  of the metallic compositions used by the Chinese.               I have en
  deavoured to learn from the works written on China, how their
  alloys were manufactured, what kind of orcs they use for that
  purpose, whether they prepare their alloys directly from the ores,
  or by mixing the metals in the proper proportions, &c. Unfor
  tunately,   I have been able to consult but few books; and these
  have   frequently   given statements which, on account of the want
  of familiarity with metallurgy of their authors, are unquestion

  quently the same name for altogether different substances.
     The white copper of the Chinese, more than any other metal
  or alloy, appears to have attracted the curiosity of the writers on
  China.    John Francis Davis”, who generally seems to be very
  well informed, speaks of it as an alloy of copper, zinc, and iron,
  with a little silver, and occasionally some nickel. The process
  of          its
         manufacture,         gives                   he        it,

  powdered ore, mixed with charcoal dust, and placed        jars over                            in
 a   slow fire, and the vapours condensed          water—leaves                   in                             no
  doubt that the Chinese furnished him with their method       distil                                  of

provinces Yun-nan and Koei-tcheou.                   The coins are called
Tschen, and are, according               Davis, composed
                                                  to                 copper and           of
zinc, with perhaps some lead. These are the only coins issued
 by  the Chinese government; and their value should                       equal                    be               to

                                 United States money.             Their market
value, however, when Davis made his observations, was equal
 1240 tschen for one tael fine silver, although the expense                                                         of to

  All the Chinese         coins are cast, and are not struck or stamped.
Many of those which I have examined showed the impression
of the fine sand used for the moulds; others were hollow, others
did not fill the mould completely, or were full of very minute
cavities and air-holes; hence the specific gravity was in some
found to be considerably smaller than it ought to have been.
   A pupil of mine, Mr. George                 J.
                                         Pöpplein, of Baltimore, has
at  my   suggestion  made in     my   laboratory  the following very                                       -
careful analyses of the various Chinese coins.
   The analytical methods adopted did not materially differ from
those generally in use. It was found, however, that tin cannot
be accurately determined by dissolving in nitric acid, &c. It was
therefore always separated in the usual way; but the binoxide
of tin was afterwards decomposed by fusion with sulphur and
carbonate of soda, by which method the small quantities of lead,
silver, copper, and iron were converted into insoluble sulphides,
whilst the bisulphide of            tin
                               and sodium was dissolved        water,                      by
&c. All the     necessary  precautions   were also taken     ensure                  to               a
complete separation           of
                          the zinc from the copper.    The following

•  From these analyses it is difficult to come to any general
conclusions, because the Chinese are not guided by certain and
invariable rules in the manufacture of their coins, although they
generally use a composition which might pass under the name
“brass.” This brass is certainly made by mixing copper and
zinc together, and only seldom directly from the ore as the
ancients did.      We know, from the descriptions given by
Father Mailla and      J.   F. Davis, that they make zinc, and also
know that long before the manufacture of zinc came into use in
Europe, the Dutch brought it from China.                   The copper which
is used for their coins appears to be always very impure, and
is evidently made from ores containing iron, sometimes with
small quantities of nickel and cobalt; analyses Nos. 3 and 7
indicate the occurrence of antimonial and arsenical grey copper
(tetrahedrite) in China.          It seems that the Chinese frequently
take at hap-hazard     whatever alloys and metals they can get, melt
them together, and cast their coins from the mixture. We have
seen, above, that alloys of copper and tin are frequently used in
China: now it seems that they add invariably a small quantity
of such alloys for the manufacture of their coins, because every
analysis shows the presence of tin; we know, however, that ores
of copper, containing tin at the same time, are not frequently met
with.

results of any importance, but as galvanometers at that period

the following simple means            effecting my object was adopted.

 428            Mr. W. R. Grove      on the Influence   of
 the dark, or as zinc to copper. The platinum plates were now
reversed, that which had been in the outer cell placed in the
porous cell, and vice versd, and the apparatus again set aside for
ten days: at the end of this period it was again taken out, the
 experiment repeated, and the same result obtained; i. e. on re
 moving the brass cylinder there was a deflection of 12°, the
platinum exposed to light being positive to the sheltered one.
    This identity of electrical effect taking place with the reversed
plates seemed so strongly in favour of the impact of the solar
rays having an initiatory effect in producing a voltaic current,
that the only remaining point seemed to be to ascertain whether
it was due to light or heat, to the chemical or calorific rays of
the sun; yet the conclusion      I  then came to was erroneous, as
will presently be seen.
   In order to ascertain how far the effect was due to heat,           I
arranged, in a room lighted by a small candle, the same appa
ratus over, a fire of asbestos heated by coal-gas, so that both
radiant heat and an ascending current of hot air impinged on
the side of the glass in which was the exposed platinum, while
the opposite side was entirely sheltered from the heat by a .
metallic shelf on which the cell rested: this experiment was
continued until one side of the cell was uncomfortably hot to
the hand, while the other side was quite cool; but not the slightest
deviation of the galvanometer took place.
   Inow repeated the former experiment with sunlight, changing
the liquid each time. In three successive experiments the de
flections on the impact of light were in the same direction, the
exposed platinum being positive; but in a fourth the deflection
was in the reverse direction, the exposed platinum being negative:
in several subsequent experiments there was always a notable
deflection which ensued on the impact of light; but it was some
times in one direction and sometimes in the other.         I ultimately
discovered   that, in the deflection   produced   by  light, the needle
of the galvanometer deviated in the same direction which it took
upon the first contact of the wires connected with the platinum
plates. The effect of light was therefore to increase the de
flection occasioned by the polarization of the platinum plates;
and this my subsequent experiments have,          I  think, fully esta
blished.   Although   the experiment    on the impact   of heat seemed
to show that the heating effect of the solar rays was not the cause
of the phaenomena, yet it might well be that the solar rays absorbed
by the platinum black would produce a greater heating effect
at the actual point of contact of the platinum and liquid than
                                                I
any non-luminous heat would produce; and was thereforeanxious
to ascertain whether the different-coloured rays of light showed
any difference in their effects. To this end I procured three

                             Light on the Polarized Electrode.                                        429
plates  of coloured glass, one blue, the second yellow, and the
third  red; a strip of thick brown paper was pasted to the oppo
site sides of each of these plates of glass, so as to form a nearly
cylindrical chamber cut by the plane of the glass. A cover was
placed over each of them; and the chambers so formed could be
placed over the cell containing the platinum plates, the coloured
glass plates intervening between the sun and the platinum in the
outer cell. A great number of experiments were made with
these apparatus; and in                          all
                                      the deviations       the galvanometer

 or  red, and,       the latter two, the yellow gave slightly greater
                        of
deflections than the red glass.

 430                   Mr. W. R. Grove                   on the Influence             of
 of homogeneity in the liquid, and the other from the state of
 surface of the platinum; the latter would most probably be the
  current affected by light.
      As the general effect of light was to increase the deflections
  occasioned by polarization, whatever direction this assumed, it
  seemed probable that the exclusion of one of the plates from the
  light, which         I
                     had commenced with in the hope of obtaining
  currents initiated by light, was unnecessary, and that the observed
  effects would be rather increased by exposing both plates to light.
I    therefore arranged two platinized plates in a cell without a
 porous diaphragm, inclined to each other like the letter W, but
 without contact, and allowed the light to impinge on the interior
 surfaces, or those opposed to each other; but, to my surprise, the
 effect was very trifling, the needle deviating only one or two de
 grees, and that in a sluggish and irregular manner.
      When, however, the two plates were arranged parallel, the
 one shading the other from the light, as good deflections were
 produced as with the porous cell,—the more so if the back or
 shaded plate was of polished, and the front plate of platinized
 platinum.
     Why light should produce a greater augmentation of the
 current when impinging on one than on the two plates,                 cannot                    I
 well understand, and therefore will not attempt any hypothetic
 explanation, but leave it for further experiment.

where the chemical changes producing or produced by voltaic
currents are always observable.
   With more sensitive galvanometers, and with a greater variety
of solutions, this class of experiments may, I venture to hope,
be found important in further investigating the effects of light
on chemical actions; and the pure coloured rays of the
                                                     -
                                                         spectrum
may be employed.
   There can, I think, from analogy, be little doubt that light
would influence those actions of surface which are comprehended
among the various effects to which the term catalysis is applied.
In an experiment I made in the month of September 1851, two
similar glass tubes, containing each 15 grains of water, were
placed, the one under an opake porcelain, and the other under a
glass vessel of the same size, with capsules of sulphuric acid by
their sides:      I
                  found that evaporation took place much more
rapidly in the one exposed to light, though it was in a room
with a northern aspect, on which the sun never shone. In twelve
days the water under the glass vessel had lost 6.3 grains, that
under the porcelain 5:4, showing a difference of nearly a sixth
part in the evaporation in favour of the tube exposed to light.
I  mention this experiment here as showing a probability that
the liberation of vapour or gas may be accelerated by light, as
M. Donny's remarkable experiments seem to show that evapo
ration is a surface action; and the effect of light on polarized
plates may be somewhat of the same nature.         will not, how        I
ever, enter into theories, which must be necessarily vague on
such a novel subject, but conclude by giving a Table of some
of the most trustworthy results which                   I
                                          have obtained when the
sunlight has been most steady, in order to show the extent of de
flections and differences with coloured light: they were     made                   all
between the hours         of   10
                          A.M. and 12, and      the finest days   on                          I

     In   order to decide this question, the following experiments
were made         —
   Glycerate of baryta was boiled with a concentrated solution of
caustie baryta for several hours, On examination of the liquid,
the substances employed did not appear to have undergone any
perceptible change.    25 grms, of glycerate of potash were dis
solved in a. solution consisting of 25 grims, of caustic potash
and 50 grims, of water, and the liquid evaporated at a high tem

the simplest         of
                 conditions will suffice. To produce the amor
phous variety, take   small battery consisting
                              a                  one  two pairs                   of               or
of zinc and platinized silver plates, charged with   mixture                                   a              of

                      Electro-deposited Antimony,                443.
one measure of sulphuric acid and twenty measures of water,
and having prepared a small quantity of the mixture of chloride
of antimony and tartar-emetic, connect with the terminal silver
a piece of commercial antimony (“best French regulus”) of the
same amount of immersed surface as one of the battery-plates,
and immerse it in the liquid as an anode, and for a receiving
surface immerse a piece of clean polished silver or copper of
about one-half the amount of surface of the antimony; connect
it by a silver or copper wire with the negative pole of the battery ;
suspend it vertically in the lower part of the depositing liquid at
 a few inches from the anode, and protect the connecting wire
from receiving a deposit near the surface of the liquid by a piece
of gutta-percha tube, glass tube, or by a layer of varnish formed
 by dissolving pure gutta percha in bisulphide of carbon to the
 consistence of treacle.    A perfectly bright deposit of amorphous
 antimony will immediately be formed, and will, if the electric
 power be rather great, exhibit a scaly surface after.half an hour's
 action; but by further continuance the scaliness will cease, and
 a firm coherent deposit of perfect brightness, and of similar
 appearance to highly polished steel, will be produced.        If the
 electric power is too great, the deposit will be granular and
 loose,    Much impure matter will appear upon the anode during
 the  process, especially if “common bowl regulus” is used, and
 may be removed by means of a hard brush and dilute hydro
 chloric acid,    There is no depositing liquid with which      I am
 acquainted, of any metal, which will bear so great a variation of
 electric power without deteriorating the quality of the deposit,
 as that composed      of tartar-emetic dissolved to saturation in
 hydrochlorate of terchloride of antimony: good amorphous de
 posits have been obtained in it with batteries varying from one
 to thirty-six pairs in intensity,
     6. To produce a crystalline deposit, prepare a similar quan
 tity of the second liquid, and proceed in exactly the same man
 ner, except that a much larger receiving surface should be used
 in consequence of the greater tendency to a sandy deposit, and
 the protecting tube or varnish may be omitted. In this case the
  deposit is gray, and frequently of a dull aspect, or even a dark
 loose granular powder if the power is too great; but when pro
  perly produced it has a silky lustre or semi-iridescent silver-gray
  appearance, especially when viewed within the liquid; and if the
  process is continued several days, or, better, for one week, the
  edges of the deposit assume a partly modular form,       The clean
  ing of the anode in this case may be of less frequency, and with
  water alone,
     7.  A speed  of deposition, varying from 0.75 to 30 grains per
   square inch of receiving surface per hour, has repeatedly yielded

444                         Mr. G. Gore          on the Properties            of
a good bright deposit with the first-named solution; and from
0.25 to 225 grains per square inch per hour has often given a
good crystalline deposit with the second liquid.    By keeping
the cathodes in constant  motion, much more   rapid action may
be successfully            ventured.
     8. By similar means to those described, and without the aid
  of motion, a solid bar of dark bright antimony, upwards of
  1 inch in diameter and 3 inches long, was formed upon a piece
  of copper wire Tºth of an inch thick and 2 inches long, in a
  period of twenty-eight days, and with the aid of motion in about
 half that time.
     9. In depositing antimony from these solutions, a variety of
 circumstances occur, a knowledge of which will greatly assist in
  obtaining perfect specimens of the two varieties.             In using the
  ordinary chloride, after the process has been progressing one or
 two days with continuous bright deposit, warty excrescences of
 the gray variety will nearly always occur upon portions of the
 receiving surface, the localities of their appearance differing
 according to the shape of the cathode and             depth          its
                                                                  immersion:        of

                                           upper parts. The presence                                   of
 these excrescences appears            nearlyin     cases       all

power became nearly exhausted, gray modules appeared; and when
once commenced, there was              strong tendency

changed from amorphous              crystalline

about 79°Fahr.; on interposing a galvanometer, the conductivity
of the circuit was found to be gradually increased during the
rise of temperature, and gradually decreased during the fall.
These phaenomena were repeatedly produced by reheating the
same portion of liquid; and similar effects were obtained with
the solution composed of tartar-emetic and dilute hydrochloric
acid.    The first liquid exhibited no material irregularity in                                             its

                                      is
variety, and therefore receives the electric current with greater
facility.    have found with perfect specimens
               I                                       gray and dark               of

446               Mr. G.  Gore on the Properties of
antimony deposited upon perfectly similar copper wires, that the
amorphous variety was electro-positive to the crystalline in the
following liquids:–dilute phosphoric, sulphuric, hydrochloric,
and mitric acids; in aqueous solutions of ammonia, potash, and
carbonate of soda; also in the first-mentioned chloride solution.
This difference of electric condition was in some instances of de
position so great as to generate a separate electric current, and
completely redissolve some of the dark portions. The phaeno
menon of lateral surface deposit did not occur in the tartaric
acid solution.    Antimony trees, consisting of branches of amor
phous and crystalline nodules, were easily formed by suspending
a horizontal copper wire as a cathode upon-the surface of the
terchloride solution.
    15. Heat was perceptibly evolved in the first-named        liquid
during deposition; on one occasion, with a feeble battery, when
the external air was at 66°Fahr., the coldest part of the liquid,
viz. behind the anode, was at 67°5 Fahr., and the warmest part
in front of the anode 71°Fahr. And on another occasion, with
a stronger battery (consisting of twenty-four pairs of zinc and
silver plates) weakly excited, with an anode of moderate size, a
thermometer in contact with the front of the anode rose from
74°5 to 87°.5 Fahr.
    16. Faint crackling sounds, audible at about 4 or 5 feet distant,
frequently occurred in the depositing liquid during the process;
they issued from the receiving surface, and appeared to be due
to alterations in the cohesive state of the metal, being generally
attended by the production of cracks, and occasionally of com
plete rents in the metal; they most frequently occurred when
the temperature of the deposit was changed by removal from the
liquid or by reimmersion.     In one instance metallic sounds were
definitely traced to bubbles of gas suddenly expelled with force
from a small spot of a very firm deposit formed upon a bar mag
net in the tartaric-acid liquid; but no fissure or orifice was ob
 servable at the parts; they were unattended by evolution of light.
    17. In common with electro-deposits generally, the inner and
outer surfaces of these deposits are in unequal states of cohesive
tension, frequently in so great a degree as to rend the metal ex
tensively and raise it from the receiving surface during the pro
cess in the form of a curved sheet with its concave side towards
the anode. This separation is very apt to occur in depositing
upon extended flat surfaces, and does not often occur when the
form of the surface is unfavourable, as with wires, rods, bars,
&c., where the deposit extends around the mass, or where it
passes round projections, edges, &c., and retains a hold thereby.
This state of tension is most manifest in thin deposits, and espe
cially in the first-formed layer; for by depositing a thin layer

                                    Electro-deposited           Antimony,                               447
of amorphous antimony upon gold-leaf attached by varnish to
a tube of glass, the film of gold was quickly raised from the sur
face, and curled into fantastic shapes by the cohesive                                             action.
Both varieties of the metal exhibit this phaenomenon.
     18. The fracture of amorphous antimony is conchoidal,
smooth, and wavy; that of the gray variety is crystalline, radia
ting like hematite. The texture of the former is rather soft and
weak, that of the latter is quite hard and strong. The amor
phous metal files easily, the gray with more difficulty.                  The
gray metal, if struck by a hard substance, emits a clear metallic
 sound, whilst the dark variety gives a more dull tone.                   The
 crystallization lines of gray antimony are at right angles to the
 receiving surface; and in several experiments of depositing upon
 magnets, the direction of those lines did not seem to be altered
 by the magnetism,
     19. The amorphous variety, if gently struck by a hard sub
 stance, undergoes a rapid and intense change throughout                 mass,                    its
 attended       bydevelopment         considerable heat; the crystalline
                                                 of
 kind undergoes         such change, apparently, under any circum
                               no
             The change appears                                                          of its
 stances,                                     molecular
                                                      to   be      character;    in
 and according        this view the crystalline variety
                          to                                     metal must
 be   regarded     being
                     as         state  in  comparatively stable molecular
                                            a         of
 equilibrium.
     20. The following are        few selected instances

of the bar, a sudden change or commotion of particles took place
throughout the mass, passing rapidly from the heated part to
the opposite end, attended by the production of a few very mi

found that the phaenomenon                        could       be   repeated with the same

   27. The only observed exciting causes   the phaenomenon have   of
been ordinary heat, concentrated solar heat, friction, percussion,
fracture, and the voltaic spark.   Heat appears always      deter                                to

fracture have frequently failed.                    Thick pieces will bear gentle
filing, but not violent fracture,  ordinary temperatures without

pieces of the metal of moderate thickness (T'ath of an inch) to a

 the thermic property, by carefully triturating them in a mixture
 of broken ice and salt. Pieces of the thickness of an address
 card were reduced to powder without the change occurring, by
 careful pulverization in water at 60°F.; the most ready plan
 adopted was by gently pressing the pieces in small quantity,

450               Mr. G. Gore   on the Properties of
by means of a disc of antimony 2+ inches diameter, a scaly de
 posit of bright black metal was obtained, possessing the usual
 thermic property.
    33. In every case where the deposited metal was dark and
 shining, it evolved heat by the exciting causes, and under the
 conditions named; and in every case where it was gray and cry
 stalline, it would not evolve heat.                           -
    34. The   physical properties of the metal  appear to be closely
 connected with the condition of the liquid; for in every case
 where the latter was sufficiently changed, whether by alteration
 of chemical composition, of density, of temperature, or of the
 electric power, a change occurred in the colour and brightness
 of the deposit; at the same time, by experimentally examining
 the influence of each of these circumstances separately, I did not
 find the peculiar state of the metal to be invariably connected
 with any one of them.
    35. On immersing a piece of the unchanged metal in mer
 cury, and applying heat very gradually, it suddenly changed
 with great force at a temperature of about 250°. F.
    36. A deposit, consisting of 279.5 grains of amorphous anti
mony and 101.5 grains of the gray variety, was formed upon a
spherical bulb of a thermometer, and, after well washing and
drying, was wrapped in cotton-wool and touched with a small
heated wire: it at once changed; and the mercury rose from
75°2 F. to 275°2 F. in twenty-eight seconds. The diameter of
the glass bulb was ##nds of an inch.
    37. A second deposit, consisting of 504:49 grains of dark
antimony, formed upon the same bulb, and treated in a similar
manner, raised the temperature of the mercury from 75° F. to
445°0 F. in 1 minute 40 seconds. The thickness of the layer
of metal was 4th of an inch; and by the great heat evolved it
acquired a dull gray aspect, similar to the gray variety.
    38. A cylindical bar of the amorphous metal, about ; an inch
in diameter, formed upon a rod of grain tin ºth of an inch thick,
when changed by the momentary application of a heated wire,
evolved sufficient heat to melt the tin completely, which ran out
through a crack in the antimony, and remained fluid a short
time. A bar of bismuth, fººths of an inch thick, coated to about
 ºths of an inch in diameter, did not melt by the change.
    39. By immersing a perfect bar of the dark variety, weighing
456.9 grains, in 836-6 grains of distilled water, contained in a
large thin glass tube wrapped in cotton-wool, immersing the
bulb of a thermometer in the water, and allowing the whole to
acquire a uniform temperature, then inducing the change by
momentary contact of a heated wire, and stirring the water to
render it uniform, the temperature of the water rose from 63°

several similar experiments,                            appeared to prevent the metal                                un

                         in          the metal: bars which were nearly

straight before the action, were considerably curved afterwards;

 thermo-electricity was in each case generated, and passed in a
  similar direction.
     43. By exciting the peculiar change in two pieces, weighing
 upwards of 600 grains each, placed in the vicinity of the poles
  of delicately suspended magnetic needles, no deflection of the
 latter in either case occurred.
     44. By taking two bars, each about 3 inches long, one of
 amorphous antimony and one of the crystalline variety, connect
 ing their extremities with a galvanometer, and cautiously bring
 ing a small flame of a spirit-lamp within half an inch of their
 remote and touching ends, the dark bar was found to be feebly
 thermo-electro-positive to the gray one.       A thin rod of changed
 antimony was found, in a second experiment, to be weakly
 thermo-positive to a large lump of gray metal.          And in a third
 trial, a large changed bar was positive to a bar formed by melt
 ing and casting deposited antimony.
    45. Both the gray, the changed, and the unchanged metal
 acquired a coating of dendritic crystals of silver by immersion
 in a solution of nitrate of silver.

454                Mr. G. Gore on     the Properties   of
Nos. 3 of gray deposit, and 4 of amorphous deposit, were formed
by the same current; and Nos. 4 of gray and 6 of amorphous
deposit, were also formed by one current.           Nos. 1 of gray, and
3 and 7 of amorphous deposit, were formed upon copper-wire
helices kept in a state of constant motion, No. 7 being formed
by very slow action.
    49. In a separate experiment, with a two-pairs battery, the
equivalent of crystalline metal obtained was 40.728, and of
amorphous metal 43'989; and in a very reliable experiment
with a moving helix, the equivalent obtained of amorphous anti
mony was 43-284. With a one-pair battery, an equivalent of
44.95 parts of amorphous metal was obtained.
    50. One source of variation in the resulting numbers of the
dark variety appeared to arise from particles of the depositing
liquid being mechanically enclosed within the depositing metal,
chiefly by the formation of minute cracks and scales; these
were, as far as possible, prevented by using cathodes formed of
wire, maintaining a uniform temperature and an uninterrupted
electric current, by suitable adaptation of the electric power, and
by keeping the cathodes in constant motion. The adhering
liquid was removed by washing in dilute hydrochloric acid,
                                                                       -
                                                                           di
stilled water, and drying.
    51. The amorphous metal invariably contained a small por
tion of chloride of antimony, more or less of which was always
evolved during the molecular change, according to the tempera
ture to which it was raised; thin pieces, changed under water,
still retained the greater portion of the chloride.        A thin speci
men, formed upon a copper wire helix, lost by change in air
0.337 per cent. of        its
                            weight, and    a  thick one lost 3-556 per
cent. The gray variety, when perfectly prepared, evolved scarcely
a  perceptible odour      of
                           burnt tartrates  or hydrochloric acid      by
                                                                      the
application  of  heat.
    52. To remove the chloride     of   antimony, portions      thin de
                                                                 of
posits were finely pulverized    in    cold water, then washed either
                                                                           in of of
with distilled water, dilute hydrochloric acid,             or
                                                             solution
caustic  potash,  finally with water and dried: small       quantities
                                            its by
the chloride were removed, especially           the dilute acid; but
each case the     powder    still retained       thermic property, and
evolved chloride     of antimony during the change.          Other por
tions of  the pulverized metal were shaken with boiling hot dilute
hydrochloric acid, also boiled    in    similar acid; the chloride was
then found    to   be  more   completely   removed, and the thermic
property destroyed.       By digesting the powder           one part
                                                            in             of
hydrochloric acid and three parts         of  water, for one week, less
chloride was evolved during the change and during the combus
tion succeeding    it.

                                                                    -
                           Electro-deposited Antimony.                         455
grains, was placed under a bell-glass filled with water, and the
change induced in it by a blow; a small quantity of chloride of
antimony separated, together with a minute quantity (less than
one-twentieth of a cubic inch) of gas: the water was then strongly
acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and allowed to rest five days;
the gas still remained unabsorbed.
   54. By fusing well-washed specimens, either of the gray or
of the changed dark variety, perfectly free from laminae or cre
vices, in a porcelain crucible, no material alteration occurred in
them until at a temperature of incipient fusion; they then swelled
to a large pasty mass, evolving volatile matter, and finally con
tracted to a clear shining globule, covered with downy crystals
of oxide of antimony. Similar results were obtained by fusion
under tersulphide of antimony or cyanide of potassium, except
that in the latter case a minute quantity of black matter sepa
rated, which     I
                 found by combustion, alone and with nitrate and
chlorate of potash, to be carbon.       The metal, previously pow
dered and placed under cyanide of potassium, agglutinated into
a pasty mass before fusion or evolution of vapour.          Five speci
mens of gray antimony, fused under the cyanide, lost respect
ively 0.437, 0-618, 0.81, and 0.88 per cent. by weight. Two
thin specimens of amorphous antimony, previously changed
under water at 60°F., lost respectively, by fusion under cyanide
of potassium, 5:1 and 5.2 per cent.              A

metal, fused     in   ordinary crucible, evolved much volatile mat

potassiun, and cooled slowly without disturbance, had strong
crystalline markings upon            its
                                    upper surface, while that fused
under chloride       potassium had not, -probably because

of physical action is the evolution of heat in antimony due 2                              If
it is caused by some new mode of physical action, then the force
causing it will of course differ, in some respects, from       other               all

employed). During my second winter at Fort Simpson, I, every three
hours throughout twelve of the twenty-four, registered twenty-one
thermometers, eighteen of Adie's and three of Negretti's, on glass
scales.     I
            never found Adie's at any temperature to differ more than
a degree   and a half from each other.     Negretti's, when they ranged
low, say twenty below zero,                            I

as well as from the other three     (having   only six remaining), being
six, seven, and ten degrees higher.     The correction (but a few tenths
of a degree) can be allowed for certainly, but this difference may not
be the same at a lower temperature, therefore it occasions a serious
drawback to the efficiency of these instruments; and         always feel                   I

 1000 fathoms, the greater depth showing a minimum 39°4, the

   when getting temperatures, particularly when more than one ther

   cause, nor the results likely to follow from the increased weight on
   the line; for although the addition of the thermometer (weighing
   about six pounds in the water-bottle) gives rapidity to the descent of
   the weight,             its

the effect of pressure in lowering the freezing-point of water, affords
a perfect explanation of various remarkable phenomena involving
the internal melting of ice, described by Professor Tyndall in the
Number of the ‘Proceedings’ which has just been published.                                                                          I
wish now to show that the stratification of vesicular ice by pressure
observed on a large scale in glaciers, and the lamination of clear ice
described by Dr. Tyndall as produced in hand specimens by a
Brahmah's press, are also demonstrable as conclusions from the
same theory.
   Conceive a continuous mass of ice, with vesicles containing either
air or water distributed through it; and               this mass      pressed     let                            be

 the pressure from without.
     It is clear that the same general tendency must be experienced
 even when there are bubbles of air in the vesicles, although no doubt
 the resultant effect would be to some extent influenced by the run
 ning down of water to the lowest part of each cavity.
     I believe it will be found that these principles afford a satisfactory
 physical explanation of the origin of that beautiful veined structure
 which Professor Forbes has shown to be an essential organic pro
 perty of glaciers. Thus the first effect of pressure not equal in                                                     all

advantages  of this method did not appear to be such as to justify
the actual expansion of the formulae for these theories. The author,
however, shows that with reference to any system of three bodies,
the equations of motion for each body naturally assume the form
                      a" + n°(w—X)=0, &c.
(being the system solved by this method); and that the X, Y, and
Z are absolutely the same for each of the three bodies. This is
shown by demonstrating, that at any given moment the three lines
which represent the direction of the force acting on each of the
three bodies          all
                 pass through the same point, which  denominated                                   is

Chalk.” By N. T. Wetherell, Esq. Communicated by the President.
  The author first described several specimens of the peculiar
banded flints found in the chalk and in gravel, and of which he had
made a large collection during several years. They usually exhibit
a central longitudinal axis or narrow stem, crossed on its middle third
by numerous short parallel stripes of alternately light and dark flint,
and frequently terminated at each extremity by an irregular mass of
flint, often clouded or grey.        The axis occurs sometimes solated,
sometimes covered with a thin coating of grey flint only, and some
times associated with only a few cross stripes of the banded structure.
In some instances the banded flint has for            axis   sponge,its  fraga             or

In  letter
     a       the Assistant-Secretary.
                 to
  At the close    1850 Mr. Stow and his party fell back into the
                             of

Dr. Rubidge      on some points   in the Geology of South Africa.     475.
interior to avoid the Kaffirs; in making the journey he collected
largely the fossils on his route, and succeeding in preserving them on
his return.
     In a plain at the foot of the Rhenosterberg, which is a branch of
 the Sneewbergen range, he met with patches of ground strewed with
 modular concretions and fossil wood, probably derived from the neigh
bouring mountains. These mountains are composed of horizontal
 strata. Eight of the beds at the foot of the Rhenosterberg are sand
 stones, above them are four layers of calcareous grit or pebbly lime
 stone with other sandstones.       These calcareous beds sometimes con
 tain   bones; but at one spot in the sandstone-rock, Mr. Stow discovered
  and chiselled out a   nearly perfect skeleton of a small reptile.  Other
 reptilian bones, and especially two small well-preserved skulls, re
 warded his search ; one of these belonged to a small Dicynodon, the
  other to a little undescribed reptile.
      Mr. Stow sent numerous specimens of the nodular concretions and
  septaria from the rocks of this place, and also specimens of the con
  cretional and other trappean rocks of two dykes that crossed the
  plain.
      2.  “On  some points in the Geology of South Africa.”         By Dr.
  R. N. Rubidge.       Communicated by the President.
      The author had observed in Namaqualand the occurrence of hori
  zontal siliceous beds, covering other siliceous inclined beds, the
  silification of the latter being apparently due to the infiltration of
   silica from the upper quartzose beds into the inclined beds below.
   In this communication Dr. Rubidge details the evidences that he
  observed of such a process having taken place, and points out how
  the observations on some of the Namaqualand rocks by Mr. Bain, Mr.
  Bell, and Dr. Atherstone, respectively, tend to support his views on
  this point. The inclined beds of this district are gneissic, and, in
  the instances referred to, very quartzose.
       The horizontal sandstones of this district he correlates with the
   Table-mountain     sandstones, but in them he has found only a few
   obscure traces of fucoidal or other plants.
       The author then passes on to the Cape district; and, first offering
   his testimony to the industry and general exactitude of Mr. Bain as
   a geologist, he proceeds to compare Mr. Bain's section of Mitchell’s
   Pass with the section he lately made for himself on two hasty
  journeys.
       Mr. Bain describes the indurated sandstone or quartzite of Mit
   chell's Pass as being at first horizontal, and then suddenly dipping
   at a strong angle northward, so as to underlie the Devonian schists
    of the Bokkeveld, at Ceres, and to divide them from the slates of the
    Cape district. Dr. Rubidge points out the apparent difficulty of ex
   plaining such an inclination of the quartzite, the slates underlying
   both the inclined and horizontal positions not presenting any evi
   dence of a difference in dip beneath the two portions of quartzite;
   and he suggests that the inclined beds of quartzite have nothing
   to do with the horizontal quartzite, except that, being immediately

 476                        Geological  Society:—
 beneath the horizontal siliceous beds, they have by some means been
  silicified from above, and thus rendered in appearance only identical.
 Taking this view, he considers that the inclined quartzite is a con
 formable successional portion of the schists and slates, the horizontal
 sandstones being of younger age than any of the schistose beds, and
 extending over them from Table Mountain to Orange River on the
 west, and to George on the east.         On the north the schists are
 known to be of Devonian age by the fossils of the Bokkeveld, and
 the recent discovery of a few trilobites and spirifers at some spots
 in the slates of the southern districts of the Cape (near Cape St.
 Francis, at Klein Winterhoek, and near Jeffery's Bay), are consi
 dered by the author as corroborative of his view, that the slates of
 the Cape are not divisible from the schists of the Bokkeveld, but are
to be linked to them by the intercalated quartzites described in this
 portion of his paper, the schistose rocks of Ceres, Cape Town, and
 Malmesbury (Silurian and Carboniferous? of Bain) having generally a
 similar strike and dip.
     In the eastern province of the Cape Colony, Dr. Rubidge thinks
 that a similar condition of silification exists in the Zuurberg range,
 although no overlying horizontal sandstones were there seen.          He
 describes in detail a section made by himself and Mr. R. Pincher,
 along the road from Port Elizabeth to Somerset, which shows the
inclined schistose beds intercalated with a band of dark felspathic
rock (the claystone-porphyry of Bain) lying conformably on and
passing into the quartzite of the Zuurberg on the south, and,
after some great flexures of the quartzites, a similar series of conform
able schistose rocks (and a felspathic band) dips from the other side of
the Zuurberg in an opposite direction.        Similar beds continue with
a diminishing dip as far as Van der Merwve's River, whence they
rise again to the north to beyond Bushman's River (at Gower's),
a little beyond which the felspathic band appears intercalated with
them.       The section then becomes obscured until the Karoo beds
are met with near Brak River, having a slight southerly dip, and
probably abutting unconformably against the schists near Calla
ghan's Inn. This section differs in some important features from
that published by Mr. Bain of the same district.
     Dr. Rubidge considers that the slaty beds flanking Zuurberg on
either side, and forming the synclinal trough at the Van der Merwve's
River, are of the same age as the quartzites of the Zuurberg, which
are in his opinion silicified by metamorphic influences: the interbedded
felspathic rock may also in his opinion be possibly of metamorphic
Origin.
    #.     author follows up his argument by reference to other parallel
sections, and regards the plant-beds of Ecca, as well as those of the
Great Fish River and the Van der Merwve's River, as being of Devo
nian age, and not belonging to the lower Karoo beds, regarded by Mr.
Bain as having a more southerly extension. Dr. Rubidge notices
that some members of the two formations resemble each other so
strongly, that sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between them.
    The plant-beds above referred to contain innumerable obscure

               On   some   Mineral Springs at Teheran, Persia.                 477
vegetable fragments, like those of stems, reeds, &c.; and in the rocks
at Gower's on Bushman's River Dr. Rubidge has seen, beside frag
mentary vegetable remains, some fine jointed stems.
   The plant-beds of the Karoo beds, at Bloemkop, contain two or
more kinds of Glossopteris, very similar to those of the plant-beds
of Central India and Bengal,
   Amongst the fossils sent by Dr. Rubidge, are several fossils from
the Zwartzkop and from the mouth of Sunday River; amongst the
latter, some Belemnites and Hamites, probably of Cretaceous age.
   A large series of specimens from the Zuurberg and Van der
Merwve's River accompanied this communication; and Dr. Rubidge
also sent a series of fossil plants from the Dicynodon or Karoo beds
of Bloemkop, with which Mr.    -  C.       J.
                                        Powell, of Graaf Reinett, had

     3.     some Mineral Springs at Teheran, Persia.” By the Hon.
          “On
C. A.  Murray,  in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, F.G.S.
   In August   the author made an excursion into the wild and rocky
valleys of Laridjan, on the northern side of the Elburz chain, to
examine some mineral springs near the village of Aske. This village
is placed on a steep declivity above the impetuous torrent of the Laur,
and is about 40 or 45 miles E.N.E. from Teheran, and near where
latitude 36° N. intersects longitude 52° E. It is only a few miles
from the lofty and slumbering volcano Demavend.          Round Aske the
country is chiefly limestone, with dark-coloured pudding-stone, and
in several places large tracts of sandy grit, in many precipitous
heights of which numerous caves and hermitages have been exca
vated in olden times.
    The most celebrated spring in the neighbourhood is the Ab-i-garm
 (hot-water); a warm sulphur-spring that rises on one of the spurs
of the Demavend, about six miles to the eastward of Aske, on the
left bank of the Laur, and probably about 2000 feet above the bed
 of that river.
    The principal mineral ingredients of this spring are sulphur and
 naphtha, with some iron and lime.         On the 15th of August, the
 temperature of the atmosphere in the shade, at two P.M., being 75° F.,
 the temperature of the spring at          its
                                        source was 150°F. From hence

carbonic acid gas are abundant in this water. There are several -
springs of different dimensions, the bathing basins of which are
at distances varying from ten to fifteen yards from each other.
At half-past five P.M., the temperature of the air in the shade
being 71°F., the water in the centre of the largest basin (where
the bubbles are thrown up by the gas to an elevation of 6 or 8
inches above the surrounding surface) was at 82°—the average
of the temperature of the other springs nearby.
   On the left bank of the Laur a small bubbling spring of water,
similar to those last mentioned, had a temperature of 85°F.        These
tepid mineral springs lying to the eastward of Aske, do not appear
to be affected by the intervention of the deep and rocky bed of the
Laur. To the westward of Aske, at the distance of about 1% mile,
on the left bank of the river, and not more than 150 feet above its
bed, is a fine cold chalybeate spring : besides iron, this probably con
tains carbonic acid gas and a small portion of sulphur.       Its tempe
rature was found to be 50°F., that of the atmosphere being 73°F.
It is not disagreeable to the taste, and in some complaints is found
very strengthening and efficacious.

mineral treasures.

   observations ON MR. coupe R’s NEW chEMICAL THEORY.
                         By M. A. KEKULá.
AT    the meeting of the 14th of June, Mr. Couper presented to the
     Academy of Sciences a “Note on a New Chemical Theory”,” in
which I find several ideas so nearly identical with others published
by me a short time since, that I think it my duty to submit some
observations on the subject.    In fact, in two memoirs which have
appeared in Liebig's Annalen, one “On Copulated Compounds, and
the Theory of the Polyatomic Radicals” (November 1857), and the
other “On the Constitution and Metamorphoses of Chemical Com
pounds, and the Chemical Nature of Carbon" (dated March 16, and
published May 19, 1858), I have put forward different views, which,
in my opinion, should furnish a clearer insight into the constitution
of chemical compounds.
   Mr. Couper commences his memoir with these words:—“I ascend
to the elements themselves, of which I study the mutual affinities.
This study is sufficient, in my opinion, for the explanation- of                   all
chemical combinations.”
   Now  in my second memoir,       page 136, there
                                           at          the following
phrase:—“I think necessary for the explanation
                        it                             the properties of is
of  chemical compounds,      ascendto            to
                                          the elements themselves                  of
 which these are composed.”
   Further on,    speaking
                 in          carbon, Mr. Couper says, “The high
                                    of
est known power         of
                      combination for carbon      that    the second          of

 degree, that is to say, 4;” and he finds that carbon has a peculiar
 physiognomy, “inasmuch as it enters into combination with itself, a
 feature so characteristic that,” according to him, “it accounts for                                                           .
 the important and still unexplained fact of the accumulation of the
molecules of carbon in organic compounds.               In the compounds in
which   2, 3,  4,  5,  6, &c. molecules of carbon are linked together, it
is carbon that serves to bind the carbon.”
   We cannot agree with him that these properties are indicated by
him for the first time.         In my first memoir (p. 133, note) I have
said  expressly   that carbon was quadriatomic in            nature, that                 its                        is   to
say, that     atom

            ON CRYSTALLIZEDWALERIANATE OF ATROPINE.
                      BY H. CALLMANN.
  This salt forms perfectly white and light crusts; the crystals
appear to belong to the rhomboidal system, and the faces are very
brilliant. At a temperature of 68°F, the crystals soften, and at
57°6 F. they are liquefied.       Under the double influence of air and
light, they soon acquire a yellow colour. The carbonic acid of
the air displaces a certain quantity of valerianic acid, which is
recognizable by              its
                        peculiar odour.
   The   crystallized  salt presents the various reactions     the salts           of                  of

 LV.   On the Theory    of Sound.      By    J. J.   WATERSTON, Esq.”
    a paper on the Integral of Gravitation that appeared in the
IN Philosophical Magazine of May last, I endeavoured to draw
attention to the principle of physical causation supplied to us by
the mechanical theory of heat, how it leads us to study natural
phaenomena in their dynamical sequence, and suggests the
arranging of problems of molecular statics so that they may pre
sent the aspect of motor transition to the mathematical inquirer.
It may perhaps be of advantage, as testing the general argument,
to discuss the question, Can the theory of the propagation of
sound developed by Newton and Laplace be viewed, consistent with
the modern idea of heat, as a correct eaposition of the actual mode
in which pulses are transmitted through air? It appears from
recent memoirs, that this opinion is still generally entertained by
physicists; and the theory of Laplace has in some instances
been considered so perfect as to afford the means of deducing
the specific heat of air from the velocity of sound, and this by
zealous professors of the mechanical theory of heat.
    The ideas upon which Laplace's theory was constructed are
 to be found in the second chapter of the second book of the
 Mécanique Céleste. The following extracts show how very re
 mote they are from those now universally prevalent:—
    Page 105, line 8. “Doubtless it is necessary to admit that
 between the molecules of air there is a repulsive force which is
 only sensible at imperceptible distances: the difficulty consists
 in deducing from it the laws of elastic fluids. This may be done
 by the following considerations.”
    P. 105, line 4 from bottom.      “Isuppose then that these mo
 lecules retain the heat by their attraction, and that their mutual
 repulsion is due to the repulsion of the molecules of the heat
 which I assume to extend to an insensible sphere of activity.”
    P. 111, line 9. “But what ought we to understand by the
temperature   u, and what is   its   measure   ?     It   appears   natural   to

dence in Laplace's views, such conviction of their truth to nature,
that he considers them entitled to supersede the result of direct
observation; and no attempt is made to reconcile the statical
theory of caloric with the vis viva theory of heat; nor is a neces
sity for doing so apparently even felt as a preliminary step to the
adopting of one of the deductions of the former as an ally to the
deductions of the latter.
  As Mr. Joule's name is conjoined with that of Professor
Thomson in this memoir, it is perhaps necessary to assume that
he also approves of this manner of deducing the ratio of specific
heats.
   Another instance of the commingling of statical and dynamical
theories is to be found in a memoir by M. Masson, “On the Cor
relation of the Physical Properties of Bodies,” which appeared in
a recent number of the Annales de Chimie.        M. Masson also
adopts the mechanical theory of heat (see §    chap. 2).   Yet   III.
in the beginning of the same chapter he writes, “Laplace has
discovered the true mathematical expression of the velocity of
sound in gas.”   Further, M. Masson states that he has found,
by experimenting according to the method employed by MM.
Gay-Lussac and Welter, that the value of k is actually what is
required to make Laplace's formula agree exactly with the best
observations on the velocity of sound.           No details are given,
although the amount of compression in such experiments is of
some importance, as the ratio increases with this amount; and
the formula has only to do with the initial ratio, or when the
change of density is infinitely small.      M. Masson has also com
puted the velocity of sound in a considerable number of compo
site gases and vapours from the pitch of the sound given by an
organ pipe while immersed in them; and thence, employing
Laplace's theorem, obtains the respective values of k, which are
thus found to range from 1:26 to 1:42 in the composite gases,
and from 1:06 to 1:27 in the vapours.
   Thus       all
            authorities, both              of
                                   the statical and dynamical school,
seem     agree that Newton and Laplace's theory

fluid whose density is as the compression,” he adds, in the scho
lium, “But whether elastic fluids do really consist of particles so
repelling each other, is a physical question. We have here demon
strated mathematically the property of fluids consisting of particles
of this kind, that hence philosophers may take occasion to discuss
that question.”
   In Prop. 47 of Book 2, Newton shows that           pulses are pro                  “if
pagated through a fluid, the several particles of the fluid going
and returning with the shortest reciprocal motion are always
accelerated or retarded according to the law of the oscillating
pendulum.”      It is assumed that the elastic force is proportional
to the density; and in the direction of the pulse the fluid is sup
posed to be divided into physical lineola, which are eagansible
and contractile, and exhibit a force that resists compression                                                          in
versely as their breadth. The mathematical reasoning defines
the law by which the breadth of these lineolae must vary while
they go and return,-and hence the law of the difference in the
breadth of two adjacent lineolae, and consequently the law of the
accelerative force operating on each corpuscle, which is thus

influence the result.       Also the repulsive action is necessarily
assumed to be limited to adjacent particles, not extending through
the interstices of these to the particles beyond (for such is the
extraordinary and improbable hypothesis required to deduce
 Mariotte's law from a static repulsive force).          This may be sup
posed subject to modification during vibratory action.
    But the hypothesis upon which the mathematical demonstra
tion rests is open to three grounds of objection                     It does                       :-1.
not take account of the condition of the front of a pulse when
the particles from a condition of rest enter into the cycle of
motion defined by the theory. 2. The force of repulsion be
tween two adjacent particles required by the theory is extrava
gantly large.      3. The other physical properties of gases are not
deducible from the hypothesis.
    To these may be added, that the dynamical theory of heat has
 suggested another hypothesis which is free from these objections,
 and which therefore claims a preference according to Newton’s
first “rule of reasoning in philosophy,” viz. “We are to admit
 no more causes of natural things than such as are both true and
 sufficient to explain their appearances.            To this purpose the
philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain, and more is
 in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with simplicity,
 and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.”
    1. The theory does not take account of the condition of the
front of the pulse, or rather of the front of the first of the series
 of pulses of which a sound consists. This is apparent if we con
 sider that a particle is represented by the theory as at rest at
 each extremity of                     its
                           oscillation, and       those points the acceleat

quired by the theory is extravagantly large.      The recent ad
vances in the theory of heat have, in a measure, compelled us to
realize the dynamic value of natural forces.     To compute the
absolute value of the repulsive force acting between two adjacent
molecules of air, we have to consider that it has to support the
gravity of the number of molecules in the height of a uniform
                           HT           .                                                                            -

of one molecule in this ratio.  Now the force of gravity in one
second can communicate a    velocity  of 32 feet per second, so that
the force of repulsion between two   adjacent molecules of air must
be capable in one second                            of communicating a velocity of 32 XT
feet. The absolute value of A, the distance between two adjacent
molecules of air, we can now with great probability deduce from

   Now suppose these balls reduced excessively in their dimen
sions, and to be perfectly elastic as well as the cushion, and we
shall have obtained an idea of how pulses may be conveyed in a
manner quite different from that depending upon a statical                                                            re
pulsive force between adjacent particles.       Instead of such stu
pendous force, we have to substitute molecules simply moving
with the velocity of a cannon-ball, and assume the atmosphere
to maintain              its
                  elasticity                             by     its
                                     particles striking against each
other with such  velocity,   which, viewed cosmically,        means                                    by   no
exceeds what     moderate,
                         is   and even highly probable       heat                                       if            is
molecular motion.

         Mr. Herapath unfortunately assumed heat or temperature to
     be represented by the simple ratio of the velocity instead of the
     square of the velocity—being in this apparently, led astray by
     the definition of motion generally received—and thus was baffled
     in his attempts to reconcile his theory with observation.         If we
     make this    change  in Mr.  Herapath’s   definition of heat or  tempe
     rature, viz. that it is proportional to the vis viva or square velocity
     of the moving particle, not to the momentum or simple ratio of
     the velocity, we can without much difficulty deduce, not only the
     primary laws of elastic fluids, but also the other physical proper
     ties of gases enumerated above in the third objection to Newton’s
     hypothesis. In the Archives of the Royal Society for 1845–46,
      there is a paper “On the Physics of Media that consists of per
      fectly Elastic Molecules in a state of Motion,” which contains
      the synthetical reasoning upon which the demonstration of these
      matters rests.    The velocity of sound is therein deduced to be
      equal to the velocity acquired in falling through three-fourths
      of a uniform atmosphere.        This theory does not take account
      of the size of the molecules.     It assumes that no time is lost at
      the impact; and that if the impacts produce rotatory motion, the
      vis viva thus invested bears a constant ratio to the rectilineal vis
      viva, so as not to require separate consideration.     It also does not
      take account of the probable internal motion of composite mole
      cules; yet the results so closely accord with observation in every
      part of the subject, as to leave no doubt that Mr. Herapath’s
      idea of the physical constitution of gases approximates closely
      to the truth. M. Krönig appears to have entered upon the sub
      ject in an independent manner, and arrived at the same result;
       M. Clausius, too, as we learn from his paper “On the Nature
      of the Motion we call Heat” (Phil. Mag. vol. xiv. p. 108).
          The physics of such media is a study that must be ungenial,
º      perhaps repulsive, to mathematicians brought up in the statical
<U+017F>:     school.   The fundamental hypothesis does not permit us at once
       to transfer the subject to the domain of pure mathematics, as
º      Newton's hypothesis converted physical astronomy into a purely
       mathematical study. The mode of action by which certain phae
     nomena make their appearance must be realized at each step in
     conformity with the conservation of force: the causal relation
     must be ever present to the mind, or no true progress can be
     made.      On the other hand, the mathematics required is simple,
     and almost every one of the applications of the theory admits of
     popular illustration.                               I
                             An attempt of this kind have given above
     in reference to the conveyance of sonorous impulses, introducing
     a dynamic theory of sound. The strict demonstration of the
     velocity is given in the memoir above referred          to.

Thus we have vº– Hg, or the velocity is that produced by gravity
in a body falling through #H. [Strictly, the square vclocity of
air-molecules must be six times this, because the above calculus
only takes account of the action in one of the six rectangular
directions of space.]
   To trace the influence of the barometer or weight of the uni
form atmosphere, we may suppose the weight of M doubled and
A reduced one-half: this leaves H and v unaltered; so that if
the density of air increases as the weight of the uniform atmo
sphere, the velocity of sound is unaffected by the barometer. If
with       M   constant      the density represented by                         ; diminishes,      H
must increase in the same ratio, and thence vºi=\, or the volume
under constant pressure as the square molecular velocity,+which
conforms to Dalton and Gay-lussac’s law, if v = temperature
from zero of gaseous tension.
     If we view these relations in another elastic fluid, where the
weight of the molecule is twice that of air, M being unaltered,
and the number of molecules in a unit volume also the same as
with air, we have H inversely as m, or one-half the height of a
uniform atmosphere of air, and v" reduced in the same propor
tion; also the velocity of sound reduced inversely as the square
root of the molecular weight or specific gravity of the gas.
   To explain the increase of temperature that arises from sud
denly condensing air, we may imagine an elastic ball traversing
a vertical between two horizontal plates and striking alternately
against them.       Those plates being also considered as perfectly
elastic, the velocity of the ball will continue uniform without                                    its
motion being impaired.          we now suppose the distance between

always, but especially in a splendid whirled spot observed on
the 7th of May, 1857, and likewise in the magnificent spot
visible to the naked eye the day of the eclipse in March 1858,
in which these clouds presented the aspect of a kind of semilucid
promontory, and were of a decided reddish colour. And it was
moreover curious to see how at a certain point the filaments were
united into an aggregated mass, forming, as it were, a whirlpool,
or boiling in a state of the greatest agitation*.
   These details demand, indispensably for their being visible, two
circumstances—a quiet state of the air, and a magnifying power
of at least 300. The aperture employed by me was commonly
that of the entire 9 French inches, or at least 6% inches, of the
great equatorial, according to the state of the air.   The draw
ings made under these circumstances are of a nature that proves
highly instructive, and they have been published on another
occasion   f.
   Now these clouds or semitransparent veils frequently confuse
the filamentous aspect of the spots; and occupying, it would seem,
the lower portion of the solar atmosphere, they conceal to a cer
tain extent the structure of those spots, as a cloud in our atmo
sphere would render indistinct terrestrial objects to a person look
ing down on them from above. Moreover the solar atmosphere
in  its lower regions cannot but          be
                                     excessively dense and absorb
ent; and consequently the depth even            only    of

                have already shown elsewhere how considerable
the effect of the absorbing power of the solar atmosphere is upon
the heat.    By having recourse to a partition of the light into
two equal portions by means of a double-refracting prism, with
which a projection of the solar disc is thrown steadily on to white

          have arrived at the following results:—
   1st. That the faculae when near the edge are noways more                                                bril
liant than the centre of the disc, but that they appear to be so
only when contrasted with the lesser degree of brilliancy that the
disc has towards      margin, its consequence    the projection
                                                    in                        of                             of

plunge into the dense luciferous aether which invests the earth,
they cause it to burn and become luminous around them. The
tremendous pressure which gives birth to such brilliant displays,
is felt several hundred feet from the meteorite itself, especially
when it sweeps along the verge of our aerial atmosphere; for in
this case the violent encounter drives the particles of rarefied air
through the more subtle aether, and enlarges the sphere of the
illumination.    It is only to such causes that meteoric bodies can
be indebted for the immense globes of light by which they are
enveloped; and these seem to exhibit the greatest splendour when
their course is nearly parallel to the horizon.
    To remove some misapprehensions respecting this theory,                                       I
deem it necessary to state that the fluid concerned in producing
meteoric light cannot belong to the meteor itself, but must be
regarded as part of the earth’s photosphere.        From his last re
port on luminous meteors, it would seem that Professor Powell
has understood me as maintaining that it is the aether which me
teoric masses themselves collect from space that burns on enter
ing our atmosphere, and becomes a source of their heat and light.
I  must say, however, that this is not the idea which intended to              I
convey in my writings, and that                 I
                                       do not believe that any ap
preciable quantity of aether or of inflammable gas could be con
fined by the feeble attractive force of such small bodies, especially
during their rapid flight through our acrial ocean.           have in                  I
some instances alluded to the     compression   of the aetherial fluid
by falling meteorites, without stating the precise manner in which
it is affected; and as the time at which my work must have
reached England could have permitted only a partial examination
of   its
       contents, there was too much room for        misconception    a                           of
my views; and       can attach

On diminishing the resistance, the bands became gradually
fainter, spreading further and further into the dark space, until,
by sufficiently small columns of liquid, this entire space appeared
filled with a luminous glow (figs. 16 and 17). The appear
ance of these bands was always introduced by a spark, and has
nothing whatever in common with the glow which may often be
observed upon the limb of the spark-micrometer when the flask
 is charged for a spark of great length. The latter could not, on

 the same resistance, the observed bands becoming longer, or
 dwindling to extinction, or sometimes bounded by a new spark,
 or short series of sparks (fig. 18).    The cases where a long
 quite regular series of sparks was observed, occurred less often,
 but still they were sufficiently numerous for observation.
     These two kinds of discharge offer also a difference worthy
 of notice for the direct consideration of the spark discharge ;
 and probably we may venture to hope for the explanation
 of many remarkable changes of light and colour in the electric
 spark by a closer study of the manner of discharge.        The con
 tinuous   discharge, which  plays a  very subordinate part  by great
 resistance, and must therefore be observed     by means of a small
 column of water, appears in such cases as a homogeneous spark of
 moderate diameter, and is recognized by the ear as a single dull
 blowº. The intermittent discharge, on the contrary, gives rise
invariably to a hissing sound, and generally, instead of a single
 spark, a broad pencil                 f
                           of sparks often with distinct intervals.
    The separate bands of light in this pencil are clearly the
partial sparks passing one after the other, but which pass so
rapidly that they appear simultaneous to the eye<U+017F>. The proof
of this is sufficiently obvious in viewing the image of the series
of sparks in the rotating mirror.
    Invariability of the course of the sparks.-If the spark-micro
meter is not protected from the motion of the air caused by the
rotating apparatus, the first sparks almost always appear quite
straight, but they soon begin to bend towards the side to which
the draught blows, and such bending increases as the discharge
continues. The change of form is a continuous one, derived by
the one spark from                 its
                           predecessor.   Even when the line     the                                        of

    On looking            at   these two Tables, we are                     at     once struck          with the
fact that for both resistances the relation                                           of    the eliminated
electricity    the original charge increases with the distance

      EVILLE*             has made        a     communication on what he terms
              “the disassociation              of
                                   compound bodies.” When heat

head.         Thus anhydrous nitric acid spontaneously                                        decomposes

rounding water. This was confirmed by an experiment in which
high-pressure steam was passed through a platinum tube filled
with pieces of lime, and heated nearly to the melting-point of
platinum.   In this case only a small quantity of detonating gas
was formed.
     Deville endeavoured to ascertain the temperature at which
 this occurred.       Regnault had observed that silver at                melting                     its
 point decomposes water, which               again liberates

 the phaenomenon           “spitting.” Deville endeavoured

 this  by  assuming that the water,            passing through the heated

took    mercury-bottle provided at the mouth with an iron tube,
        a
and at the lower part, near the bottom of the bottle, with a
second tube at right angles to the axis of the bottle. This bottle
was heated in a blast-furnace in which a white heat could be
produced, the roof of the furnace being perforated to allow the
vertical tube to pass through. The bottle was filled either with
pure iron filings reduced by hydrogen, or with pure iron sponge.
When the temperature in the furnace had reached white heat,
hydrate of potash was passed into the bottle by means of the
vertical tube, and the horizontal tube was provided with a re
ceiver.   As soon as potassium had been obtained, the operation
was rapidly stopped, when he observed—
    1. That as soon as the supply of potash ceased to be very
 rapid, much potash was volatilized. Potassium is only obtained
 when large quantities of potash are added through the upper
tube.
    2. On sawing across the bottle, the iron in the part of the
bottle which had been hottest was found to be as bright as before
the experiment, and without a trace of oxide. In the lower part,
where there had been less heat, there was a magma of oxide of
iron and potash.
    3. If the whole bottle is kept at the temperature at which the
 magma in the previous experiment is formed, no trace of potas
 sium, but only hydrogen and potash are formed.
    It may therefore be concluded that, in passing over the white
 hot iron, the hydrate of potash decomposes into            elements, and         its
 potassium, hydrogen, and oxygen             their free state reach the

which those phaenomena will be explained where velocity enters
as influencing the result of chemical affinity.
  In   the above communication the view has been again raised
and furnished with new grounds by Deville, that a body may
decompose at a higher temperature, and at a lower temperature
be again formed out of the elements into which it had decom
posed,—so that, knowing the starting-point and ultimate results
of the action of heat upon a substance, no change would appear
to have taken place.     Kopp + points out that, in the fact that
this is possible, and probably is more frequent than is generally
supposed, an explanation may be found of the unusual condensa
tion shown by a number of substances in the vaporous condition.
   Bodies usually correspond to a condensation to one, two, or four
volumes.     But there are compounds which, from the determina
tions of their vapour-densities, show condensations differing from
these ; and some of them, which may be considered as deter
mined with certainty, are as if they had been decomposed, at the
temperature at which the vapour-density was taken, into sub
stances out of which they could be again formed at lower tem
peratures.
    For the haloid compounds of ammonium, NH4 Cl, NH*Cy,
analogy with HCl would lead us to expect a vapour-density cor
responding to a condensation to 4 volumes. Bineau found that
their vapour-density corresponded to a condensation to 8 volumes;
and it is probable that at their volatilizing-point they decompose
into two substances whose space together occupies 8 volumes—
into NH*= 4 vols., and HCl or HCy, also = 4 vols. The same
is probably the case with the compounds PH*Br and PH4Cl.
    Analogy with HS would lead us to expect for NH4S a con
densation to 2 volumes.       Bineau’s determination gave 6 vols.,
just as if the compound had decomposed into NH*= 4 vols.,
and    HS-2    vols. The vapour-density of NH4S, HS ought to
 correspond to 4 vols. Bineau found it to be 8 vols.       Probably
it decomposes into NH*= 4 vols., and into 2 HS = 4 vols.
    Cahours found that PCl” showed, at temperatures which              lie   so
far above the boiling-point       the body that

posed with hydrochloric acid exactly into chloride of magnesium
and siliciuretted hydrogen, the latter would have the formula
Si H*, thus—
                 SiMg2+2 HCl=Si H2+2MgCl,-
and might contain in one volume half a volume of silicon gas
and two volumes of hydrogen. But in the decomposition, oxide
of silicon was formed, the production of which might, however,
depend on a secondary process, and stand in connexion with the
simultaneous    occurrence   of free hydrogen.
   The manganese which Brunner+ obtained by reduction of the
fluorides and chlorides of sodium by means of sodium, was found
by that chemist to possess other properties than that reduced
from the oxide by charcoal; and on examining a specimen pre
pared by Brunner, Wöhler found that it dissolved in hydrochloric
acid with difficulty, and left a residue of oxide of silicon; and it
was hence probable that this difference in the properties depended
on the presence of silicon which had been formed by the action
of the fluorides on the substance of the crucible. Wöhler has
madet a variety of experiments with the view of obtaining a de
finite compound of silicon and manganese.
   A mixture of equal parts of fluoride of manganese, water-glass,
cryolite, and sodium, firmly pressed in a Hessian crucible, and
covered with a layer of a mixture of chloride of sodium and
chloride of potassium, and then heated in a furnace, yielded a
well-fused, hard and brittle regulus, the fracture of which had       in
dications of a lamellar crystalline aspect, but appeared to contain
no free silicon. It was much less readily attacked by acid than
was Brunner's manganese.           Each piece became covered with a
crust of dense oxide of    silicon;    and the gas which escaped con
sisted of   hydrogen    containing      siliciuretted hydrogen; for on
being passed through a gently heated tube, a beautiful mirror
of silicon was formed. This specimen contained 11.7 per cent.
of silicon.
   Another experiment made with a mixture of fused chloride of
magnesium and sodium, fluor-spar, water-glass and sodium, gave
a fine brittle regulus containing a few small cavities lined with
steel-coloured prismatic crystals.          This siliciuret of manganese
contained 13 per cent, of    silicon,  thus nearly corresponding to the
formula Mnº Si, which would require 13:37 per cent.
   In two experiments made with sodium, chloride of manganese
and sodium, and silicofluoride of potassium without the addition
of fluor-spar, no manganese was obtained. In another experiment
a mixture of chloride of manganese, sodium, cryolite, and quartz
                                                                      e

sand was taken.    The regulus had indications of a lamellar cry
stalline structure, and a colour slightly inclining to yellow. It
contained 11 per cent. of silicon.
   Brunner had found that manganese prepared by his process,
without the intentional addition of silicon, contained from 0-6 to
6.4 per cent. ; and in one preparation in which silicofluoride of
potassium was added, a regulus was obtained containing 9.86
per cent. of silicon *.    He found that the proportion of silicon
may be diminished by mixing the regulus in coarse powder with

    and trouble are expended in observing the exact temperature and
    pressure to which the gas is subjected at the time of measurement;
    and also in calculating from these data the volume which the gas
    would occupy at the normal temperature and pressure.            Frankland's
    excellent apparatus, on the other hand, protects the gas from the
    influence of variations of atmospheric pressure, and, under favour
    able conditions, even from the influence of change of temperature;
    but the complication of this apparatus, and          liability     derange                       its                     to

     The author   observes that if rarefactions alone produce sound, it
follows that a   simple   contraction of the muscles of the ear will ren
der sounds inaudible.        It follows also, on the same hypothesis, that
a more delicate exercise of the same muscles will render the organ
minutely susceptible to the influence of certain sounds, to the exclu
sion of others.     It is urged also, that, admitting the action of these
muscles to be to a large extent involuntary, there can be no doubt
that by practice a great degree of command may be acquired over
them.     The author conceives that we may in this way account for
the  facility acquired by many persons of reading and writing, and of
carrying on intricate trains of thought, without being disturbed by,

I    have since examined more minutely one            these bodies. At the           of

for  a considerable time without any change becoming perceptible.

a  new crystalline base.
   To obtain this compound           state    purity, the brown crystalline

washings chiefly consist of hydrochlorate of aniline, which base
separates in oily globules on addition of potassa to the filtrate.      By
testing the filtrate in this manner from time to time, it is found that
the basic body separated by addition of potassa gradually exhibits a
tendency to solidify, and ultimately falls as a yellowish-white crystal
line precipitate. The residue upon the filter is now dissolved in
warm (not boiling) water, separated by a filter from a brown resinous
insoluble substance, and precipitated by ammonia or potassa. The
crystalline precipitate obtained in this manner is washed till free from
alkali, and repeatedly crystallized from weak spirit. It is difficult
to obtain it perfectly white, a yellowish substance, which appears to
be partly formed during the process of solution, adhering with great
pertinacity.                               -
    Thus   obtained,  the new base is a white crystalline powder; fre
quently it is obtained in minute scales, generally of a yellowish tint.
 It is insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in alcohol and ether.
 From the hot solution in these solvents it is precipitated by water as
 a yellow oil, solidifying on cooling with crystalline structure.      It is
 easily dissolved by acids, with many of which it forms crystalline com
 pounds.     From the saline solutions thus produced the base is repre
 cipitated by potassa and also by ammonia. The salts of the new base
 are not very stable; their solutions, especially when heated for some
 time, inevitably contain more or less aniline, the crystalline base itself
 undergoing changes which                   I
                                  have not yet sufficiently examined.
    The   analysis  of the new compound presents some difficulty.
 Even after   protracted  exposure over sulphuric acid in the exsiccator,
 it retains a small   quantity  of water, while a temperature of 100° is
 apt to decompose           it.

    The object kept in view by the author of these researches was to
 determine the law which governed the resistance of cylindrical tubes
to external uniform pressure. The anomalous condition in which
these constructions have been placed in reference to the internal flues
of boilers, and the frequent fatal accidents from explosions produced
by collapse, have imperatively called                  for
                                               inquiry into the causes which

             Owing to indisposition, I have been obliged to leave my experi
           ments for the present incomplete.    But I am desirous, before the
           session of the Royal Society closes, to place on record some facts
       which I have observed, and also some conclusions which I deduce
       from these and other recent experiments and discussions.
           Mr. Faraday's chief fact, to which the term “regelation” has
       been more lately applied, is this, that pieces of ice, in a medium
       above 32°, when closely applied, freeze together; and flannel adheres
       apparently by congealing to ice under the same circumstances.
           1. These observations I have confirmed.                  But I have also found
       that metals become frozen to ice when               they   are surrounded by                                                  it,   or
