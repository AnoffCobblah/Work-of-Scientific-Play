polarizing angle the reflexion of light from ordinary trans
         liquids and solids deviates sensibly from the laws of
  resnel, according to which the reflexion of light polarized
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence should vanish when
the incidence takes place at the Brewsterian angle. It is
found, on the contrary, that in most cases the residual light is
sensible at       all
                  angles, and that the change     phase      180°,  of              by

   Since the time of Jamin many valuable observations upon
reflexion have been made by Quincke and others, which it is
not necessary for my purpose further to refer             1889*                     to.     In

                  if
the illumination at the centre for G is more than half as great
as is found (6) for B at the upper and lower limbs of the sun.
A considerable development of colour is thus to be expected,
when the band is well formed.
   The band may be achromatized with the aid of a suitable
prism, held between the nicol and the eye, but of course at
the expense of introducing colour at           upper and lower     i.
limbs of the sun. I had at my disposal a glass prism of 10°.
This diminished, but could not annul, the colour when held
nearly in the position of minimum deviation ; but by sufficient
sloping the band was practically achromatized. When more
dispersive materials, e. g. benzole or bisulphide of carbon,
were substituted for water, the development of colour is very
great, and in the case of the latter made it impossible to judge
of the perfection of the band. The above-mentioned glass
prism was of course quite insufficient for compensation.
   The magnitude of these chromatic effects is given at once
by Brewster’s law, which we may write in the form
                            tan (9-H 80)              = a +8m.

The necessary angle is thus independent of the dispersive
power, and does not vary rapidly with the refractive power,
of the substance.      For water, i=9/25 in circular measure, or
about 22°.      For glass  (u-15) we should have i = 18°.
   An attempt was made to achromatize the band from bisul
phide of carbon with a 15° prism of that material. So far as
could be judged the colour was compensated, but the obser
vation was imperfect on account of the insufficient angular
magnitude of the solar disk.

   In the neighbourhood of the polarizing angle, M, S vary
slowly, but T varies rapidly.  Hence, if y be given, we may
regard (12) as determining tan a tan 8, while (11) gives T,
and thence the precise angle of reflexion for the dark spot.
If there be no ellipticity, M=0; whence tan a tan &=0,
T=0, indicating, as was to be expected, that the dark spot
occurs at the Brewsterian angle.
   But this law is not universal. For if there be no compen
sator, y=0, and we have as the expression for the intensity,
            (T cos a cos Á+S sin a sin B)*-i-M* cos” a cos" 8.
Hence, if a. and 8 are small, the second term cannot be made
to vanish, and the brightness is a minimum when
                                    T= —Stan                a tan   8.
The position of the nearly dark spot is thus dependent upon
a, A, and assumes the Brewsterian position only when either
a or 8 vanishes.

  The first systematic experiments upon cleaned water
surfaces showed that the ellipticity, if real, was pretty close
to the limit of observation. At this stage I expected to find
the marked ellipticity of greasy water gradually diminishing
to zero as the purifying process was carried further, but
remaining always of the same sign, so long as it could be
observed at all.      This anticipation was not completely verified.
                   ...
The larger differences of 2, found with ordinary water upon
which camphor fragments were fully active, amounting say
to 40', rapidly diminished under the skimming process, so that
the final                 on the purest surfaces seemed just to
escape direct observation.        It frequently happened that no
displacement of the dark spot relatively to the cross wires
could be detected on the reversal of 8. But when, in order
to the highest accuracy, many sets of alternate readings were
taken, the difference would come out sometimes in one direc
tion and sometimes in the other. A small difference of 2", or
more, on the side of the contaminated water was easily
accepted as due to incomplete cleaning, but                         I
                                                        was for a time

the opposite direction.       That these differences were not errors
of observation was soon apparent ; but I thought that they
  lº
might be of instrumental origin, due perhaps to some mal
adjustment.
   The outstanding question was so small that it might per
haps have been dismissed, but                   I

      It
       would appear that the first of these were premature,
insufficient time having been allowed for the contamination to
spread.    The difference, reckoned as before, may now be
taken to be about —30', and is in the opposite direction to the
small effect of the clean surface.     For the contaminated sur
face k=   —-0026,  and for the clean k= +-00018”.
   Although the above results, and others of a similar nature,
obtained both with tap-water and with distilled water, render
it practically certain that k is positive for pure water, I do not
regard with the same confidence the numerical value above
recorded. It is difficult to feel sure that the cleansing was
sufficient. A theoretical objection to the hoop method has
already been alluded to; and the more perfect methods de
pending upon the use of convection currents f are scarcely
applicable here. Attempts were indeed made to work with
a surface cleaned by an ascending column of fluid, the column
being expanded by heat communicated to it from an immersed
platinum spiral, itself warmed by an electric current.         But
the readings were not accordant; and it appeared that the
observations were prejudiced by the deformations of the
surface which are the necessary accompaniment of such a
flow. Doubts as to the perfection of the cleanliness actually
attained lead me to think it possible that the true value of k
for an ideal water-surface may be even twice as great as that

   Opportunities for useful work upon clean surfaces have been
very few, for it is hopeless to attempt observations without
a prospect of at least an hour's almost uninterrupted sun
shine.    But shorter and more uncertain periods may be
utilized for observations upon contaminated surfaces, as these
do not demand the same care or amount of repetition. As an
example of such I will record the readings of June 6, from a
water-surface slightly greased with               oil

ellipticity is abundantly         evident.      For example, camphor
was   quite   active  upon  a surface which gave a difference of
readings of —80', corresponding to k = –007.                       On this
occasion the surface had stood for some time without much
protection, and it is possible that the effect may have been
partly due to dust.

   The last example that will mention of aqueous solutions is
a strong brine. This gave a somewhat variable difference of
about —5', corresponding to k = –-00042.                 In this case there
seemed to be unusual difficulty in getting the surface clean,
so that the difference between the brine and pure water is
not improbably due to some secondary cause.
   Most of the available time was spent upon water in                                              its

           the    Light emitted by Incandescent Zinc Owide.                   21
 at a constant voltage, the temperature being below normal to
 secure permanence.         The quality of the light was not very
 different from that of an ordinary luminous gas-flame.
    Similar measurements to the above upon the spectrum of
 the light radiated from a surface of zinc oxide, the wave
 lengths selected being the same as those in the platinum
 spectrum, made it possible to compare the radiating-power of
 the two materials, when subjected to the same conditions of
temperature.
    The apparatus and the method used have been described in
 detail in the paper on the Colour of Pigments, just cited. In
 our determination of colour at high temperatures, a film of the
 oxide which had been prepared by smoking a strip of platinum
 foil over the flame of burning zinc was heated to the desired
 degree by the action of an electric current upon the foil. The
 surface of the oxide was illuminated by means of an incandes
                                                                      ..
 cent lamp, and the spectrum of the reflected light was compared
with that of another lamp similar to the first.           In the experi
ments to be described in this      paper, the first lamp  was dispensed
 with, and a study was made of the light from the
surface itself. Since the rays to be measured were for the
most part very feeble, it was necessary to carry on the
experiments in a perfectly dark room. Temperatures, as in
our study of colour, were determined from the expansion of
the foil.
    The measurement of the temperature of incandescent foil
 by means of the expansion of the metal is somewhat less
sensitive than the method of change of electric resistance, but
it is much to be preferred to the latter whenever a direct
calibration of the metal by reference to the air-thermometer,
or to the melting-point of metals, is impracticable ; for the
reason that the coefficient of expansion is much less affected
by traces of impurity than the resistance coefficient                 is.     A

Merritt. The curves for resistance and temperatures obtained
were widely different, the one being convex and the other
concave    tothe base-line      temperatures. Any single formula
                                 of
for  temperature,  applied       these two wires, would have given

values which at one thousand degrees were more than one
hundred degrees apart.   We think that the well-known
formula of Matthiesen,
               l=l,(1+:00000851 t + 0000000035 tº),
which we made use of in these experiments, may be applied
to any commercial specimen of platinum, of reasonable purity,
without the introduction of such serious errors, and that,
whatever may be the general correction which it may be
found necessary to apply to that formula, in order to obtain
temperatures in absolute measure, it will always be possible
for any one knowing the formula used to be sure of the
approximate temperatures, without reference to the character
of the individual piece of platinum employed.

     The character of the colour of the incandescent zinc oxide
 can be given more explicit expression by means of isothermal
 curves, in which the                                of intensities throughout the
 visible spectrum is shown for a given temperature, than in
 those which have just been presented.                         Three ways of drawing
 these curves offer themselves.                    The absolute distribution of
 intensities may be given, the resulting curves being such
 as would be obtained by exploring the spectrum with a

                               Light emitted by Incandescent Zinc Oride.                                                25

        expressed in terms of those of the comparison-lamp, wave
        length for wave-length ; or, finally, one may express the
        curve for each temperature in terms of the radiation from
                    at the same temperature, wave-length for wave
         ength.     Our knowledge of the spectrum of the incandescent
        lamp was not accurate enough to enable us to adopt the first
        of these methods, which is moreover not so well adapted for
        the graphic expression of colour as is the second one. The
        third method offers the advantage of a direct comparison
        between the light from platinum and from the oxide under
        like conditions of incandescence.
           In figs. 7, 8, and 9 the second method has been adopted.

         In the course of our experiments it was found to be more
     and more difficult to obtain consistent measurements as the

     temperature of the film increased; and it soon became evident
      that we had to deal with an unstable state of incandescence,
     the oxide being much brighter when first ignited than at any
      later period. The changes were most rapid during the first
      ten minutes after the foil was brought to incandescence, after
      which time the rate of change was not such as seriously to
     interfere with the accuracy of the determinations.            All the
      results  given   thus far were obtained from films which had
      been heated for a sufficient time to ensure their permanence.
      Values for films freshly ignited were also obtained. They
      were always higher than those of the older films.               Such
      results, owing to the fact that they pertained to surfaces the
      radiation of which was fugitive, have been excluded from the
     tables and curves. It was deemed desirable, however, to
      determine as accurately as possible the manner in which the
     incandescence of fresh films diminished as a function of the
     time.     For this purpose a set of rapid readings were made.
     A film newly prepared was ignited, and settings of the inten
      sity were made at intervals of ten seconds from the time when
     the current was applied. These readings were less accurate
      than those made at leisure, and one setting, instead of a
     series of five or ten, had to be taken to represent the radiation
     at a given instant of time. The same method was then pur
     sued for another wave-length, a fresh film being prepared for
     the purpose, and this was repeated until a series of time
     curves were secured which included the entire spectrum. The
     results for each wave-length gave a curve showing the rate
     of diminution with the time. The curves were all of the same
     general type; but they showed the time-effect to be least in
     the red, and to increase as the wave-length of the region
     observed decreased.        From these data it was also possible to
     construct a series of intensity-curves, showing the relative
     brightness of the spectrum and     its  characterat   any given time
     between the limits covered    by   the observations.    These curves

     six hundred seconds from the moment        of  ignition    of

     effect” became very noticeable      at   about 900°; and       seems

heated,  similar to those exhibited by the oxide of zinc.
Cylinders of lime, for example, when freshly ignited in the
oxyhydrogen flame, attain a momentary brilliancy and white
ness which is not reached during any subsequent ignition.
   The extraordinary brightness of the magnesium flame also
is undoubtedly to be ascribed to a state of initial incan
descence such as that which we have observed in zinc oxide.
W. H. Pickering*    found the character of the light of burning
magnesium to be that corresponding to a temperature con
siderably above 3000° C. Recent measurements of the actual
temperature of the flame, however, show that it is not above
1400° C.
   Other instances of abnormal incandescence of the metallic
oxides might be cited. At what temperatures the effect

amount “A.” 2nd. Take a chemically equivalent weight of
an alkali, dissolve it in an equal quantity of water, measure
the electromotive force of the couple in     i.  solution and call
the amount “B.”         3rd. Take an equivalent weight of the
salt resulting from the union of the acid and alkali dissolved
in the same quantity of water, measure the electromotive force
in a similar manner and call the amount “C.” We have
now the electromotive force “A” excited by the acid; “B” by
the alkali; and “C” by the salt formed by their union.
4th. Multiply the electromotive force “A” by the equi
valent weight of the acid, and the one “B” by that of the
alkali, add the two products together, and divide the sum by
that of the two equivalent weights, and call the quotient “D.”
“C” represents the mean electromotive force excited by the
compound as found by means of experiment, and “D” that
arrived at by calculation.       5th. Subtract the experimental
amount “C” from the calculated one “D’’ (or the reverse,
as the case may be), and a difference remains which repre
sents the relative amount of loss (or gain) of energy which
has occurred during the act of chemical union, change, or
mixture of the acid and alkali or other substances employed,
as measured by the particular positive metal.            And, 6th.
Ascertain the   percentage    amount of loss or gain of the calcu
lated electromotive force “Dº” in various cases.           By this
process we obtain a series of percentage numbers which we
may view as representing the relative amounts of loss (or
gain) of molecular energy which have occurred during the
actions with the different substances under the given con
ditions.
    The method is essentially one for directly measuring the
differences of mean amount of electromotive force excited by
two different electrolytes, and by the liquid produced by
mixing them together, with particular positive metals, before
and after mixing ; and as these differences must indicate
the quantity of energy of some kind lost or gained during the
mixing, the method is to a corresponding extent a means of
ascertaining, the amount of relative loss or gain of energy
during the chemical union or mixture of electrolytes.       If we
use only a single kind of positive metal, the method may be
regarded as a system of measurement of the relative losses
and gains of energy as obtained by means of that particular
metal.    Each positive metal is probably only affected by

30                 Dr. G. Gore on a Method of Measuring
and only measures the influence and changes of a portion of
the molecular motion of the substances present, viz. that por
tion which neutralizes some of the molecular motion of that
metal and converts it into electric current.        In a research on
“Relation of Volta Electromotive Force to Latent Heat,
Specific Gravity, &c. of Electrolytes” (Phil. Mag., August
1891, p. 157), I have shown that in various cases of dilution
or mixture of such liquids, a gain of mean amount of electro
motive force of the two liquids occurs simultaneously with a
loss of latent heat during the act of mixing, the kind of energy
therefore measured by this method is not identical with that of
heat; and as we do not know definitely of what “chemical
affinity” really consists, we cannot say that what is measured
is identical with chemical energy. Whilst the thermochemical
method only measures the proportion of energy which causes
thermal change, the present one only measures that which
produces electric change; and it is probable that the kind of
energy measured differs somewhat with each different kind of
positive metal.      That we are unable clearly to define either of
the fundamental kinds of energy, and that the modifications
of them are very numerous, is generally admitted.
    A number of suitable pairs of acids and bases, acids and
carbonates, acids and salts, &c. were examined with different
positive metals according to this method, and the percentage
amounts of loss or gain of molecular energy ascertained.           All
the measurements of electromotive force are given in volts.
The means employed of obviating undue influence of polari
zation have already been described (Phil. Mag., Dec. 1890,
p. 484), and were sufficiently effectual in nearly          cases.       all
  It   would have saved much labour, and have yielded more
simple and apparently more important results,           the measure if
 ments had been limited           to
                                those obtained with    single positive
                                                                    a
 metal. But whilst taking great care             obtain substantially
                                                              to

                            to
 that the phenomena            nature are more simple than they
                                 of

                     were
phuric acid followed by baryta. The solution of caustic soda
was prepared by adding small fragments of sodium to water
in a covered nickel crucible.    Chlorate of rubidium could not
be  used, because it was not  sufficiently soluble; carbonic acid,
chlorine, and iodine were too insoluble to form solutions of
the usual degree of strength, and weaker solutions had to be
employed.
   The results are given in series of tables. The quantities of
substances used in each single table were chemically equiva
lent to one another, and those of one table were usually so to
those of other tables, except in certain cases which the reader
will have to observe.    “Strong solutions” contained 1 equi
valent weight in grains dissolved in 1800 grains of water ;
in consequence of the sparing solubility of carbonic acid, the
“weak solutions” were arranged to contain only one tenth
that quantity or 1 equivalent weight in 18,000 grains of
water.    In Tables XVI., XVIII., XIX., XX., XXII., XXIII.,
 XXIV., XXV., XXVIII., and XXIX, still weaker liquids
 were used.    In           all

                  Conclusions from the Results of Section                              A.
   1st. In nearly every instance with Acids and Alkalies,
whether the electromotive force was measured by means of
a positive metal of aluminium, tin, cadmium, zinc, or mag
nesium, there was a loss of that force due to the act of
chemical union ; and the proportion of losses to gains in the
entire series was 81 to 1. 2nd. The amount of such loss
depended upon five different conditions, viz. the kind of acid,
of base, of positive metal, the degree of dilution, and to some
extent the temperature.      The losses were usually greater
with     all
          the other acids employed than with carbonic       they                                 ;
were   larger with caesia than with any other base    they were                       ;
usually greater with aluminium than with any other positive
metal, and with very weak solutions than with more concen
trated ones; but the order      magnitude    ofloss with salts        of                                     of
 potassium was nearly the same with strong solutions        with                                 as

weak ones.        3rd. The losses were often largest with the sub
stances of greatest chemical energy. though several striking
exceptions exist to this statement.            Whilst they were usually
larger with hydrochloric than with hydriodic acid, and with
sulphuric than with nitrie, chloric, carbonic, and the halogen
acids, they were greater with formic acid than with either of
these ; and whilst they were larger with aluminium than
                                                                          with
 tin   as
       a   positive metal, they were usually larger with tin than
with    cadmium,      and with cadmium than with zinc                    mag                    or
nesium.          reasonable explanation

                   Conclusions                from the Results in Section B.
     1st.   In     all
                    the cases with acids and carbonates, whatever
kind     of   positive metal was employed, there was either   loss                                        a
 or gain       of
              electromotive force due        the chemical change.       to
2nd. The losses were more        frequent   than the gains. 3rd.
Whilst        in
             Section      where the        A,
                                      energy         chemical union                 of

                                                             of                of                                 of
gain only          the present Section the numbers were
                   1,    in                                      and                                      57
  13 respectively. 4th. The amount          loss      gain depended     of              or
upon the same conditions                  Section           as

losses were greater with formic acid and with caesia than
with all other substances, the same                Section       and      as      in                  A
                                                                                                      ;
were usually larger with very dilute solutions than with more
concentrated ones, but the order               loss with salts           of                                       of
potassium was nearly the same with strong solutions             with                                  as

  weak     ones, the same as in Section A.               6th. They were
  smaller with the carbonates than with the hydrates ; whilst
  with aluminium as the positive metal, the losses with hydrates
  varied from 42.7 to 1398 per cent, with the corresponding
  carbonates they varied from 22:43 to 2.78 per cent. ; they
  were smaller with the carbonates, because the energy of
  chemical union was less, and because a portion of the energy
  had already been lost during the act of union of the base with
  the carbonic acid; the same circumstances explain to some
  extent the occurrence of gains instead of losses of electro
  motive force in some of the cases. And 7th. The magnitude
  of losses was largely affected by the kind of positive metal ;
  whilst with aluminium the losses with carbonates varied from
  22:43 to 2.78 per cent., with                   tin
                                           the variation was from       loss                         a

      loss, however, was           the majority
                                            in        cases substantially

  the same with different positive metals.             The proportion                                      of
  gains      losses was much larger with zinc than with cadmium.

      The mixture Nass0, +2KCl in the above table                                     was   re
   examined with each of the three solutions at about 98°C.
   The electromotive force of the KCl solution was 9501, of the
   Na2SO, 9644; and of the mixture of the two '95382; the
   calculated electromotive force of the latter was 9570, and
   the loss 00348 or 363 per cent. The rise of temperature
   therefore, whilst diminishing somewhat the electromotive force
   of each of the three liquids, had very little effect upon the
   percentage of loss in this case.

                           Conclusions from Results of Section D.
            1st.A sufficient number and variety of instances of what
       are  generally  considered to be mere mechanical mixtures are
       here given to show that such cases are attended some by a
       loss and others by a gain of energy.      2nd. The gains were
       more   frequent  than the losses in the proportion    of 23 to 2,
       and were of      greater  magnitude.    Whilst with cadmium
       in Table XII. of Section B, where the energy of chemical
       union was much larger, the number of cases of loss was 14
       and gain 6, in this section the numbers were 2 and 22
       respectively ; and whilst in the cadmium table of the former
       section, the largest loss was 15-64 per cent., in this one it was
       only 1.6 per cent. ; in this section there was no case of large
       loss because there was none of strong chemical union.        And
       3rd. In this series, as in Sections A and B, the order of
       magnitude of the results appears to agree with that of the
       magnitudes of the atomic weights of the metallic bases.

largest and most frequent in those mixtures in which no
recognized chemical change took place, and in which an acid

of chemical union, increase of mean specific gravity of the
uniting substances was usually attended by decrease of mean
electromotive force, and in those of mere dilution it was
accompanied      by increase of mean electromotive force of the
ingredients.       5th. In certain cases heating the liquid
permanently altered the amount of change of energy, and
converted a gain into a loss, evidently because it produced
chemical change. These instances may be viewed as ones of
 unstable mixture, the chemical equilibria of which are per
 manently upset by elevation of temperature, and the molecular
 changes of which are not reversible.               6th. As action and
 reaction are always equal and contrary, we may conclude that
 the losses of energy suffered by the two mutually reacting
 substances are always equal in amount; this remark would
 apply equally to the two soluble substances during the act of
 mixing, and to the positive metal and the substance which

     beg to offer the following simple explanation of the chief
result, viz. that the loss or gain of mean amount of electro
motive force coincided with the presence and absence of
chemical action. The electromotive force appears to depend
essentially upon the degree of freedom of molecular motion.
The substance which most strongly attacks the positive metal,
and by neutralizing some of                                  its
                                          molecular motion excites
electromotive force,      the most electronegative constituent
                                        is                                                                    of
the liquid.    When this substance (acid           halogen) chemically     or
combines with    any  ingredient       the mixture      of usually loses             it
heat and energy freely;            this act        by
                                                 union        moleculesof                 its
acquire less freedom          motion, and consequently can only
                                             of
excite    decreased mean amount of electromotive force with
               a
the  electropositive  metal.    But when the solution          this sub                    of
stance     only diluted
               is                            by
                             the second liquid, much less amount                a

         molecular motion        neutralized       lost, and the mole

loss     energy and

                                                                 of                            of
liquids,            so
             that the molecules                         of
                                      the substance can now excite
an increased mean amount of electromotive force.                  These
remarks must apply           some degree     in   the oxygen         the   to                        of
water, because the water itself excites some degree               volta                             of
electromotive force.

 just referred  to, and others in a continuation which will
 shortly be communicated to the same Society.     In this note                      I
  have only mentioned the two theorems which give rise to
 a-formulae by simple addition, and to the corresponding
 g-formulae by addition after changing the signs of the even
 numbers, my object being merely to supply an arithmetical
 explanation of the general resemblance, and differences in
 detail, which are observable in corresponding pairs of a-and
 §-formulae.
    § 18. The recurring formulae which are deducible from the
 general theorems by adding the cubes and higher uneven
 powers of the numbers in each group, and adding the same
 powers after changing the signs of the even numbers, neces
 sarily exhibit the same kinds of resemblance and discrepancy
 as the a- and º-formulae of §§ 1, 2, and 11.
    § 19. Thus, for example, by adding the cubes of the numbers
 in the general theorem of § 4 we find

V.     On the Calculation of the Induction-Coefficients of Coils,

   is well known that the electrokinetic
          in two circular conductors
                                                                  energy of the
                                                              can be expressed by a
                                                                                       cur
series of zonal harmonics.      This                     series, when used in the
ordinary way to find the energy of the currents in two cylin
drical coils (and hence also the induction-coefficients of the
coils) by expansion of each term of the series and subsequent
integration, does not yield expressions which are convenient
for practical applications, as the work of calculation is long
and tedious.        |
                   have found, however, that it is possible very
simply to integrate each term without expansion ; and the
result shows that a pair of coils may be constructed in such a
way that the zonal harmonic expression reduces to a very
manageable form, and the energy of the currents, and there
fore the induction-coefficients and mutual action of the coils,
can be very readily obtained.
   With regard to the construction of coils it is possible, by
using fine wire wound by a screw-cutting lathe in a close
single layer on an accurately turned cylindric surface, to
make a coil of a large number of turns the dimensions of
which can be determined very exactly, and in which the dis
tribution of the wire is perfectly definite. Such a single
layer coil     have long advocated for use in absolute gal
               I
vanometers. It has sufficient uniformity of field to render
the placing of the needle at the exact centre quite un
essential, and it can be made sufficiently sensitive, so that it
possesses the advantages of the Helmholtz double-coil arrange
ment, without the uncertainty which exists in the latter as to
the distribution of the different turns of wire in the two
multiple-layer   bobbins, or requiring the correction-terms
which these bobbins involve on account of their finite cross
section.
   By integrating the zonal harmonic expression for two
circles with intersecting axes, in order to find the correspond
ing expression for the mutual energy of two single-layer coils,
I  have obtained a series, the even terms of which all vanish
                                                                       its

                  the axes.

  diameter in the ratio of V3 to 2; and the fifth term also
  disappears when the larger coil fulfils the same conditions.
  Further, if both coils are thus proportioned and placed, the
  even terms, so to speak, doubly vanish, so that any little
  inaccuracy in the placing of the coils can only very slightly
  affect the result.
      We are thus left with the first, seventh, ninth, eleventh,
  &c. terms of the series.      If one coil has half the radius of
  the other, the error made by taking only the first term in
  calculating the inductance &c. of the pair of coils is only
  about 1 in 26,000; and if the ratio of the radii is as great as
  #, only 1 in 4500.

 IN topractical estimates of the strength of materials it is usual
         take the greatest compressive or tensile stress which
 the material is found in experiment to sustain, and divide it
 by a factor of safety to insure against sudden applications and
 reversals of the load, and against flaws or sources of weakness
 that cannot be foreseen.      Among the latter, cavities or air
 bubbles in the material hold a place; and these may also be
 taken in a general way for purposes of calculation as the type
 of flaws consisting of a defect or weakening which is confined
 to a limited volume of the substance.
    Thus, in the case of a shaft transmitting a torque or couple,
 the shearing-stress is annulled over the volume of the cavity,
 and this may lead to greater than average shearing-stress in
 some part of          its
                   immediate neighbourhood.              the case                   In                    of

times even begins to flow, before the critical condition is
attained; and, secondly, the conditions that produce a break
down of the material are but vaguely understood.
    A spherical portion of the mass becomes, when strained, an
ellipsoid of which the principal axes determine the three prin
cipal elongations which constitute the strain.            Now it is
sometimes assumed that a         simple   change     of volume by
compression or expansion cannot produce or affect rupture,
and therefore this ellipsoid need only be compared with the
sphere of equal volume from which it is derived by three
simple shears in mutually rectangular planes.           The value of
the greatest of these shears may then perhaps be taken to be
the circumstance determining the limiting strength of the
material.    It may, however, be remarked that, as the forces
of cohesion between the elements of the material are not
infinite, it must            be possible          to break     it down or pull it asunder

and the absolute value               of resistances are now known with                              as
great a degree of accuracy as any electrical constants; so that
any laboratory possessing a resistance-box and a Clark cell
has the means of measuring a current with sufficient accuracy
even to replace the Kew magnetometer.
   Starting with these considerations, I was led to conclude
that the most practical way of measuring the magnetic force
would be by running a measured current through an ordinary
sensitive reflecting-galvanometer, used either by the tangent,
or, preferably, the sine method.          For this purpose, a gal
vanometer and         lamp    its

   The lower portion of the figure represents the potentiometer;
it would, of course, be preferable if this could be replaced by
a battery of sufficiently constant E.M.F. capable of giving a
 milliampere without polarizing.      Not knowing of any such
battery I   was compelled to use accumulators, which will give
quite large currents, and vary less than Tokoo part in half
an hour, and measure the E.M.F. at each observation.
   G was generally a tripod galvanometer of about three
ohms’ resistance; with the voltage used, R had to be made
about 4000 to give a deflexion of 45°, so that the current
used never much exceeded a milliampere; this was quite
insufficient to change the temperature of the coils appreciably.
The resistance of G and the leads to it being a very small
fraction of R, their temperature-variation was of no account,
and only that of R in resistance and C in E.M.F. had to be
considered.
   The usual procedure was to set the galvanometer G so as
to bring the spot of light to zero ; then turn it 45° one way,
and apply a current, adjusted by the box R, sufficient to bring
the light back to the zero ; then take the potentiometer
reading and temperature ; break current; set the galvano
meter at 45° in the other direction from the meridian ; apply
the necessary current, the key K being reversed : while this
flowed, read the potentiometer again, then break the current,
and turn G into          original azimuth, noting that the light
                                 its
returned    to the exact position.    The whole operation takes
scarcely five minutes. Sometimes         longer series

          had no magnetometer at my disposal for compari

building containing a          and other masses of iron.
There seems no reason to doubt, however, that with a gal
vanometer whose constant had been carefully determined, the
method would give reliable results.

Grotthus, and, second, the probability              the new hypothesis

put forward           in    its
                        place.
     Clausius   objects        the Grotthus theory chiefly for two
                                   to
reasons.      He   explains       detail    in   that   in   §

stratum        adjacent molecules, and

                                  in                     has  previously as   he
shown,        inadmissible.

                                       like manner the action          the                    at

equally inadmissible.
    Now, though              it admitted that this reasoning may
                                       be
 be   correct when applied           each pole separately,

opposite sign would then combine and,              fact, may       said

     In other words, the Grotthus molecular chains               not end                do

84                            Mr.    J.   Brown on         the    Theory        of
dissociated part-molecules in the electrolyte are normally
engaged in ousting other part-molecules from their partners
by a process of exchange which, when directed by the attrac
tion of the positive and negative poles, constitutes electro
lysis; the dissociated part-molecules finally becoming attracted
to their respective poles and evolved there in the free state *.
    It is evident, however, that by this process the original
number of dissociated part-molecules is not increased, and
therefore must soon become exhausted at the electrodes by
the action described, after which conduction would cease.
Yet it is evidently necessary for continuous conduction that a
steady average proportion of dissociated part-molecules be
supplied.
   A process which would provide for at least some fresh
dissociation of whole molecules is described in the third
paragraph of $7 as one that may occur, but does not seem to
be recognized as a necessity.              It is assumed that in the
course of the heat-vibrations among the molecules the nega
tive part of one whole molecule may come so close to the
positive of another as to combine with              leaving the former    it,
partners           of
              each free.                      (It

partners combined, the other two would combine also, and
would not               be

                Electrolytic Conduction of Clausius.                                          85
    On the other hand, if the work done by the current, in
 separating from any electrolyte certain substances, is the
 equivalent of the heat evolved by the recombination of those
 substances, it seems simpler to assume that the work is
directly applied to produce decomposition at the electrodes.
    The hypothesis of molecular interchange as proposed by
 Williamson to explain the process of etherification is quoted
by Clausius in $10 in support of his theory; but Williamson's
process was purely one of molecular interchange between the
partners of whole molecules, no part-molecule separating off
till in the act of combining with a new partner. It is limited
to this, and there is no mention of separate part-molecules,
dissociation theories, or so-called free ions. Therefore, though
the dissociation theory has been frequently referred to as                                    º
Williamson-Clausius hypothesis, it is not supported in any way
by Williamson's paper.
    From these considerations it would appear that both the
necessity for and the probability of the hypothesis put forward
by Clausius are very doubtful.
   Turning now to more modern views, I have already pointed
out in the ‘Electrician    for April 19, 1889, that an experi
ment considered by Prof. Ostwald as serving to remove the
last doubts as to the validity of the assumption of free elec
trically-charged atoms of chlorine and potassium *, is of a
purely negative kind, and throws no new light on the subject
at all.

                     else the ions must    give     their charge           up
 through the semi-permeable wall, which then acts        metallic               as   a

86                Mr.  J. Brown on  the Theory   of
was observed, which decreased. at first rapidly. and in about a
quarter of an hour became constant at 10. When the battery
was cut out of the circuit there was a strong secondary current,
and on dismounting the apparatus, it was found that copper
had been deposited on the parchment-paper in that vessel con
taining the positive pole of the battery.
    From these observations it was concluded that the posi
tively charged copper ions, not being able to pass the partition.
gave up their electricity in order to deposit in the metallie
form.     Certain electrochemical actions are described in detail
as having occurred at the other portions of the circuit.
such as the passage of potassium atoms through the other
partition, but apparently no attempt was made to ascertain
if they actually took place. One has a right to expect that
some evidence of their occurrence should be given, but none
appears.     Simply the conclusion is drawn that the foregoing
appears to show the correctness of the above-mentioned pro
 position. that the semi-permeable walls are for certain ions
 permeable, and for others not.
    But it will. I think, be admitted that in the absence of any
investigation by analysis or otherwise of the actual products
at the porous walls, the phenomena actually described might
 arise from a certain degree of conductivity in the matter pre
 cipitated in the parchment-paper.      In fact, if the parchment
 paper were replaced by platinum sheet with either a small
 amount of any kind of porosity or none at all, phenomena the
 same as, or similar to, those actually observed would occur,
 i.e. the initial decrease of current, the secondary current, and
 the deposit of metallie copper.
    It remained, then, to test the precipitate for conductivity.
 I  prepared it by adding potassium-ferrocyanide solution to
 excess of copper-sulphate solution, filtered off and washed the
 red-brown precipitate (which is said to strongly retain potas
 sium ferrocyanide, together with the copper salt), and dried
 it in the air without heating.
    Into one limb of a small Ü-tube, about 9 millim. in diameter,
 was dropped a short piece of carbon rod of nearly the same
 diameter as the tube and connected to a platinum wire passing
 up the other limb for connexion to battery and galvanometer.
 On the end of the carbon was spread a layer of the precipitate
 about 1 millim. thick.     The whole was then placed in a small
 glass  jar containing strong sulphuric acid, and closed by a
 paraffin plug through which passed a carbon rod that could be
 brought down on the precipitate. After standing eight days
 to dry the precipitate and glass surfaces, the upper carbon was
 lowered into the tube, but not in contact with the precipitate,

and the arrangement put            in circuit with two cells and a
reflecting-galvanometer.          No deflexion ensued ; but as soon
as the upper carbon was pressed down on the precipitate,
there was a deflexion of 429 divisions.             To estimate roughly
the resistance of the     layer   of precipitate,  a resistance of 10,000
ohms was now        interposed.        This reduced the deflexion to
426, indicating a resistance of about three quarters of a
megohm.
   On cutting out the battery there was a distinct secondary
current.    This secondary current would go to show that the
precipitate was a conductor of the second order, and therefore
perhaps unlikely to act as a metallic diaphragm. . It was
therefore necessary to examine the nature of                 conductivity                its
more   closely;  and since the      precipitate    prepared      described                      as

and a salt solution, we may have in each pore a small voltaic
circuit composed of the cupric ferrocyanide as metallic con
 ductor, and the two liquids as electrolytes. That very unusual
 phenomena may arise in a minute circuit of this kind is already
 shown by the copper-zinc couple of Gladstone and Tribe. But
 whatever the actual process may be in this osmotic-pressure
 experiment, it is evident there is more to be considered than
 the mere smallness of the pores.
    In the B. A. Report, 1890, p. 333, Prof. Ostwald concludes
 that one consequence of the dissociation hypothesis is that
 “in general water must show against every electrolytic
 solution the potential of the faster ion;” and that this is
 confirmed by the experiments of Nernst and of Planck at
 references given.      In Planck's paper he does not appear to
 have made any experiments himself, and those of other authors
 referred to were carried out by means of metallic poles
 immersed in the liquids, and so introducing the unknown
 quantity of metal-liquid contacts.        The experiments of Nernst
 appear to have the same defect, and, in addition, to refer only
 to circuits containing three or more liquid contacts, and can
 not give any definite information about individual contacts.
    This evidence is therefore      -
                                       also of a purely indecisive
 character.
    In the same Report, p. 335, the same author states that
 “according to Faraday's law              all
                                       chemically equivalent amounts
    positive and negative ions are charged with equal amounts
of of
    electricity.”    One could wish that Prof. Ostwald had given
a  reference    toFaraday’s statement         this “law.”

criticisms are offered, not to prove or disprove any particular
theory, but rather to point out that in support of certain
theories there is being advanced a quantity of evidence that

   Take the body within which it is desired to maintain a con
stant temperature, and wrap it very closely with a fine
covered wire having a high specific resistance.           The wire
should not be of     iron,  or  any substance which is liable to
suffer large permanent changes of resistance by oxidation or
heat.     The body having been wrapped as completely, as
closely, and as uniformly as possible, a constant electric cur
rent is now passed through            By this means can  it.  prac                           be

and having  double  walls, was mounted         three legs,  two                                       of

  The whole       then set is     small dish-pan, which allows

ice to be easily packed under the bottom of C.            If an ordi
nary double bottom be used it will be found difficult to keep
ice there, and the temperature of the water is liable to rise
to 4°C.
    Within       C is  placed  another copper vessel H, containing
whatever is to be heated to constant temperature.              In this
experiment I used a large glass test-tube wrapped with
 No. 22 German-silver wire. Some cork feet were waxed on
to the bottom of H, and the test-tube was suspended in H
 by means of a cork top.          Cork in the figure is indicated by
diagonal shading.
     A little raw cotton placed about the test-tube in H will
stop convection-currents and much improve the steadiness of
the temperature.
     On C is next placed a metallic cover through which the
 terminals of the wire wrapping are led out and connected to
 the battery.       This metal cap is covered with crushed ice, and
 the whole inside region is thus surrounded by a wall at
 Zero.
     The test-tube was filled with water whose temperature was
 measured with a sensitive Baudin thermometer on which the
 degrees      (Centigrade)    were 10 millim. long; so that with a
 telescope      there was no difficulty in reading to rºo of a
 degree.
     In   series with the storage battery (in this case 12 cells) is
  placed a loop, r, of German-silver wire on which are strung
  two wire connectors.          A copper shunt, s, soldered across
  these two     connectors,  as in the figure, makes of the whole a
  simple and excellent rheostat by means of which changes in
  the E.M.F. of the batteries, or temperature changes in the
  resistance of any part of the circuit, may be compensated.
     A duplicate slider, parallel to s, should be added in order
  that one may be clamped while the other is moved, thus never
  breaking the current.
  ..".
     A simple rheostat, devised by Mr. C. H. Bedall, and oc
  cupying much smaller space, is made by ploughing a number
                      grooves in a piece of     stuff and connecting
   i.
  by U-shaped copper connectors.            These grooves are then
          with mercury, and the resistance varied by sliding the
  connectors.
      As a source of constant current     I have used Julien storage
   cells, and find that they leave little to be desired.
      One does not need a large current even for the production
   of comparatively high temperatures; for the final tempera
   ture of the enclosed space increases as well with the thermal
   conductivity of the packing between the hot and cold walls

    For the recognition of a constant current one cannot use
 an ordinary tangent-galvanometer, since, while variations in
 the direction of H can be eliminated by commuting the cur
 rent through the galvanometer, the variations in the intensity
 of H cannot be so eliminated. Neither is a D’Arsonval gal
 vanometer available; for there is a time-variation in the
 rigidity of the wire suspension, and a temperature-variation
 in the field of the permanent magnet. Not only so, but such
 an instrument must be used with a shunt, and unless the
 shunt has the same temperature-coefficient as the suspension
 wire and coil of the galvanometer, the shunt ratio will vary
 .
 with the temperature. However, if one has no better instru
 ment at his disposal fair results may be obtained with this.
A Thomson centiampere or milliampere balance, being                    in
 dependent of thermal and magnetic changes, and needing no
        for ordinary purposes, is an ideal instrument for this
WOrk.
    The rheostat, r, should be placed immediately in front of it
for convenience.
   An additional convenience is obtained by placing a re
latively small resistance in series with the Thomson balance,
so arranged that it can be shunted out at will.               In this way
the current can be temporarily increased.                Otherwise it will
take a    long  time for the condition of              steady  flow to be
reached.
   A temporary increase of this kind is what is meant, in the
observations which follow, by the note, “current temporarily
increased.”

  These observations were                 made          during the past summer in
the Physical Laboratory of Haverford
   From the first set it will be seen that the temperature was
held constant within Iºn of a degree for three quarters of an
hour; in this case no cotton packing was used.
   In the second set it will be observed that the condition of
steady flow has not quite been reached, for the temperature
continues to rise slowly.    Nevertheless, there are two separate
intervals of more than 40 minutes each, during which the
variation does not exceed Tºo of a degree.
  I  regret having had to leave the laboratory before could                           I
make further experiments, for                     I
                                  feel confident the method is
able to give much greater constancy.
   Its chief advantages are that it can be applied to a vessel
of almost any shape in almost any position. This feature
makes it especially valuable for the determination of coeffi
cients of expansion by the method of Boguski described in
the Zeitschrift f. phys. Chem.        482;      fact,

       ATTHIESSEN,          in his classical researches on alloys,
           º
         divides the metals into three classes—namely, those
which when melted together seem to be merely mixed ;
secondly, those in which a complete change of properties
takes         on the addition of a very small quantity of another
metal; and, lastly, those between which something of the
nature of chemical combination seems to take place.
    He finds, on determining the electric conductivity of alloys
belonging to these different classes, that in the case of the
first group the curve of conductivity is a straight line, that in
the case of the second, and by far the largest group, the
curve of conductivity resembles a U; but that in the case of
the third group the conductivity abruptly rises at some point
and then falls again, such discontinuities, according to
Matthiessen, indicating the existence of compounds formed
between the two metals.
    It   is,think, open        question whether many

the zinc will polarize the whole surface of the copper, and the
cell will give very nearly the same deflexion on an electro
meter as a Daniell's cell.
  We have here, then, a delicate method for detecting the
presence of very small quantities of a more positive metal
when merely mixed with a more negative metal.
   If,however, these two metals have entered into combination
with the evolution              of
                        heat, energy must     absorbed     the              be                   in

 alloy     is  last reached which gives almost the same E.M.F.

96           Mr. A. P. Laurie    on the   Ewistence    of a
    Having thus dealt with alloys occurring in Matthiessen's
first two groups, it seemed of interest to examine next an
alloy in which he believed chemical combination to have taken
place, and   I have therefore selected the gold-tin alloys as
most suitable for this purpose.
   Matthiessen's conductivity-curve for these alloys resembles
a   W in shape, and he suggests that there are three compounds
formed by these metals, one corresponding to the maximum
point, and two to the minimum points of the curve. To these
compounds he gives the formulae Au,Sn, AuSn, and AusSns
respectively".    It remains to be seen what fresh light the
new method throws upon these conclusions.
   With a view to these experiments          I
                                            obtained some pre
cipitated gold and some of their finest grain tin from Messrs.
Johnson and Matthey, and made up with these a series of
gold-tin alloys by melting the metals in a clay tobacco-pipe,
and after thorough mixing drawing the melted metal into the
stem.    The alloys so obtained were white and brittle, the only
one having a slightly yellow colour being the last of the series,
containing 10 per cent of tin. The percentage composition
was calculated from the weights of each metal taken.       This
was found sufficiently accurate, and was checked in the case
of one alloy, as will be presently explained, by an assay which
              ...]
Prof. Roberts-Austen kindly had made for me at the Mint.
The result of the assay only differed by 2 per cent. from the
composition             from the weights of metal taken.
   The alloys having been prepared, a small voltaic cell was
arranged, consisting of a solution of stannic chloride in the
outer cell, prepared by passing chlorine into stannous chloride,
and a solution of gold chloride in the inner cell, in which was
immersed a plate of pure gold.     A brass clip tipped with pla
tinum and connected to    mercury  poles in a paraffin block was
used to hold the little rods of alloys.   Each rod of alloy was
carefully cleaned with a fresh piece of glass-paper just before
being immersed in the cell.
   The measurements were made with a Thomson's quadrant
electrometer and checked against a standard Latimer-Clarke
cell.
   Two or three peculiarities showed themselves with this cell
which I have not observed in the case of my experiments
with other alloys. In the first place, a considerable deflexion
was obtained between two plates of gold, one in the outer and
one in the inner cell, apparently owing to an E.M.F. between

ing 10 per cent. of tin, a further rise of E.M.F. was obtained,
showing quite      marked difference between the gold and the
                        a
alloy.   In other cases where a compound has been found in
the series, very little, if any, rise of E.M.F. has taken place
until that compound has been passed. This seems to indicate
that in the case of these alloys the energy required to decom
pose the compound is not so great as to reduce the E.M.F. of
the cell to that obtained with gold alone.
   Another peculiarity of a more objectionable kind was the
fluctuations in the readings taken on different days. These
were small and did not affect the relative positions of the
alloys one to another,      rising     falling together

only prepare it in short pieces.       On testing the E.M.F. of
small pieces of this alloy they behaved in a curious way, some of

if  we take tin as having an atomic weight of 118, and gold as
having an atomic weight of 197. The formula, then, AuSn,

This  method, then, confirms the existence     one    Matthiessen's               of          of
supposed compounds, but has not confirmed the existence                                                              of

may agree     with one another, still they must contain errors
which it is  impossible   to avoid, but which should not be lost

presumed that the above-determined densities of water contain
an error at least in the fourth, or perhaps even in the third

pare the densities found by experiment with those calculated

                        Density              of Water with         the Temperature.                        111
heat (Thomson, Van der Waals, Tait, and others) we know of
the existence of a sort of relation between the pressure and
melting-points of ice and the maximum density of water; also
that with respect to this last property Amagat demonstrated
a lowering of the temperature of the maximum density as the
pressure rises *; but the fact of a change of density being
dependent upon an alteration of pressure at different temper
atures, although theoretically admissiole, still requires experi
mental investigations, confirming those general laws which
govern the volumes of gases and liquids in relation to changes
of temperature and pressure.
   The Influence of the Expansion of Solids.-For water as yet
we have no determinations of expansion made independently of
a change of volume in other bodies (for instance, the containing
vessel or solids in general), because the process of determining
the height of columns of water at different temperatures pre
sents practical difficulties which I consider it out of place to take
into account here, but which                              I
                                    desire to overcome if it be at
all possible. The true volume of water, W, is determined from
the apparent (observed) volume Wº by multiplying it f by
the changed volume vi of the solid envelope; hence it is evident
that however accurate the measuring of the apparent volume
be, the resulting V, will include the entire error contained
in the expansion of the envelope. As regards the expansion
of envelopes, in spite of numerous investigations, there is a
great deal of confusion and doubt and more or less improper
application.
   1. Very frequentlyt, in order to obtain the true volume V,
  * By using formula No. 7, it is easily seen that, as the pressure rises,
the temperature of the maximum density falls, and that, at a pressure of
1000 atm., it will be    below +4°. Hence    far       necessary     consider
                                                                         it

water    alcohol, sulphuric acid, salt, &c., also lowers the temperature

Now the true expansion of mercury through the same range
of t is expressed by the formula
                        W,+        1    + (179.97+0.0208                        t) 10-8 t.
   Thus the coefficient of cubical expansion of glass is seven
times less than that of mercury, while      thermal increment                   its                                    is

the result very palpably.        Thus, for instance,     the true                                 if

                     Density of Water with                 the Temperature.                             117

future within the limits                I
                            indicate (+7 for 18210). Matthies
sen (1865) having determined      the coefficient of expansion of
glass and water, employed them for fresh determinations of
the expansion of mercury, but his results are not sufficiently
accurate to elucidate the matter".      Besides this, as the mean
coefficient of expansion of   mercury  from 0° to 100° does not
give the variation of the coefficient of expansion of glass,
which variation must be recognized, therefore we must allow
an error, affecting the fifth decimal place, in the data for the
volumes of water, which error proceeds entirely from the fact
of taking the mean coefficient of mercury as a basis.
   The Determination of Temperatures.—The majority of the
determinations of the variation of the density of water with a
rise of temperature have been made with the aid of ordinary
mercury thermometers,      correcting their readings relative to
the position of zero and to calibration, although to the exclusion
                                                                                             º

since in the constancy of the temperatures and in the readings

of glass,     temperatures between
                   at                      and 30°, were below the    0°

120         Prof. D. Mendeléeff on   the Variation in  the
St. Pétersbourg, t. i. p. 249), in Heidelberg, made a determi
nation of the expansion of numerous liquids by the volumetric
or thermometric method, which was afterwards adopted by
Despretz, Kopp, Pierre, and many others.                   Although
Muncke's results were communicated to the Academy in
 1828, they only appeared before the public in 1831, i.e.
simultaneously with the investigations of Stampfer.          Muncke
determined the expansion of the vessel by means of mercury,
taking the value given by Dulong and Petit (...). Muncke's
 results for low temperatures (0° to 30°) are greater than the
 actual values, and those for higher temperatures (40° to 100°)
 are less. This is due to the insufficient accuracy of calibration
 and to the determination of the coefficient of expansion of glass.
 It should be observed that most of the results of Muncke's
 researches appear inaccurate when compared             with recent
 researches.
      3. Stampfer   (Pogg. Ann. xxi. p. 116) in 1831, in Vienna,
                                                    º
 determined the expansion of water hydrostatically by weigh
  ing a brass cylinder, whose linear expansion was previously
 determined and found to be 0-001920 between 0° and 100°.
 The determinations were conducted between —3° and +40°,
 and were expressed      (taking the volume at 4° as unity) by the
  formula S,--So 4 at—bt” +ct”—dt'.        By the             of least
  squares the constants were : S.–999887, a = 60-932, b =
  8:4236, c=0 0580, and d=0.0001207, on multiplying by 10°.
  Temperatures below zero appear for the first time in Stamp
  fer’s researches.     For —3° he gives the volume 1.000373;
  and since the difference of the volumes at —3° and — 5°
  equals 0.000275,    I have introduced the number 1.000648 for
   –5°. The coefficient of expansion for brass given by
  Stampfer is too large, and hence the volumes exceed the true
  values.
      4. Despretz (Ann. de Chemie et de Phys. t. 70. pp. 23,
                                                       º:
   47), in Paris, 1837. His determinations made at temperatures
   from —9° to +15° had chiefly in view the
   densities near 0°.    Despretz
                                                               of the
                                   made but few determinations for
   temperatures from 20° to 100°, and only gave them to
   hundred-thousandths.        But even these must be considered
   as  among  the most   trustworthy  up to the present date. The
   coefficient of expansion of glass was only determined for a
   portion of the dilatometers by means of mercury with Dulong
   and Petit's figures.    From 0° to 28°, for glass, k=0.0000255,
   and from 0° to 100°k was equal to 0-0000258.       For a long time
   Despretz's figures were in general use; and if they have been
   eventually replaced by more recent ones, such a change has
   not really any firm foundation.        Generally speaking, our

            Density of Water with    the Temperature.          121
information respecting the expansion of water from — 10° to
 100° has hardly made any progress since Despretz's determi
nations, as regards their trustworthiness.
    5. Pierre, in 1847, published a series of volumetric-thermo
                  .
metric determinations for the expansion of water, but did not
calculate the ultimate figures.       A complete calculation of
Pierre's results from -10° to 100° was subsequently made
by Frankenheim       (Pogg, Ann. 1852, lxxxvi. p. 463), whose
figures are given in the table.
    6. Kopp (Pogg. Ann. lxxii. p. 1), in 1874, like Pierre,
measured the expansion of many definite liquids, and amongst
them of water,             with a view to compare the expansion
of liquids up to their boiling-points.      The method adopted
was a volumetric-thermometric one.        The coefficient of expan
sion of glass was deduced from      mercury,  taking Dulong and
Petit’s number. The calculations for the volumes are given
in four separate equations for various ranges of temperature
from 0° to 100°.
     7. Plücker and Geissler (Pogg. Ann. 1852, lxxxvi. p. 238)
adopted a method of compensation, and were the first to take
 Regnault's figures for the expansion of mercury.          Into the
thermometrical     vessel,  whose coefficient of   expansion   was
determined    by means of mercury between 0° and 100°, as
much mercury was poured as was necessary to compensate
the expansion of the vessel, and hence the quantity of water
subsequently introduced was considered to expand in a space
 whose volume remained unaffected by a rise of temperature.
 In these determinations too much mercury was taken, so that
the apparent expansion of the water contains a certain excess
 (as Miller observed in 1856); secondly, the mean coefficient
 of expansion of mercury between 0° and 100° was taken to be
 the same as between -5° and +15°, which is evidently
 inaccurate (the true expansion of mercury between —5° and
  +15° being still unknown, for Regnault's determinations start
 at higher temperatures); and thirdly, the coefficient of expan
 sion of the envelope between –5° and +15° is presumed to
 be equal to the mean coefficient of expansion between 0° and
  100°, which is also inadmissible.    But apart from these points,
  which are common to the determinations of other observers,
  the results given by Plücker and Geissler are distinguished
  for their remarkable accuracy, which shows that the method
  adopted by them is capable of giving admirable results, were
  the data of the expansion of mercury and glass fully known.
  These investigators expressed the results of their determina
  tions graphically by a very well-proportioned curve, although
  for only a small range of temperature not far distant from 0°.

                                                 He determined
the coefficient of expansion of glass, by means of mercury,
between 0° and 90° for vessels blown out of the same glass,
and obtained very discordant results from two determinations,
viz. 0-00002625 and 0.00002424. He only adopted the former,
but this gave larger volumes than found by other observers,
 which is especially apparent at 0°.
    13. Rosetti (Pogg. Ann. Ergänz. Band, v. p. 265), in
 1869, published a fresh series of determinations for the density
 of water, which were made by a combination of the volumetric
 and gravimetric methods.      #. determined the coefficient of
 expansion of glass according to Regnault's data, and found it
 to increase with a rise of temperature.   His observations were
 expressed by a formula of the form :

not at         all

 solutions at the points indicated, and strong evidence that
 their occurrence had an intimate connexion with the existence
of a corresponding hydrate. Wishing, however, to make
assurance doubly sure                      I
                              carried out, after my first paper was
written, a series of experiments on the freezing-points.          The
isolation of the tetrahydrate, whose percentage corresponds to
one of the most feebly marked of the changes which                had                                       I
previously discovered, amply justified my view of their con
nexion with hydrates; but the entire agreement of the minor
changes, marked G) on the diagram, with those previously
found was perhaps even more satisfactory. Of the thirteen
changes previously found to exist between 2 and 98 per cent.
nine were confirmed, while as regards the others, which were
situated in regions of very low freezing-point, data were either
insufficient or entirely lacking.
   Remembering that the results set out above were obtained
by the application of the same method and the same form of
curves to figures which in the majority of cases differed
entirely from one another in general form, the question arises
as to how such concordance could have been obtained.               we                                       If

    Setting aside for a moment the concordance of independent
results, and thus ignoring the main grounds of my conclusions,
let us see what Prof. Rücker's results do towards disproving
my opinions in the one particular case which he investigates.
  I    may as well state at once that I consider Prof. Rücker's
 equation to agree with the experimental results just as satis
 factorily as my own drawings do, and more satisfactorily
 perhaps than he asserts; for I have recently revised my esti
 mate of the experimental error, and obtain a value for it

140                  Mr. S. U. Pickering           on the Densities
    Prof. Rücker admits that “the curves in some parts—if not
discontinuous—have peculiar features which suggest special
physical causes : ” his “doubts have always had reference to
the minor changes of curvature,” such as those here dis
cussed, “and to the use of the ruler in detecting them.”           He
certainly does not appear, however, to have done much to
justify these doubts ; for however we may differ in our
explanations of these changes, or of the relative degree of
suddenness with which they occur, he must admit that I with
my bent ruler have as a matter of fact discovered the exact
points at which he with his mathematics has found that a fresh
order of conditions becomes appreciable, and again disappears.
    Prof. Rücker would, no doubt, point out that, although the
fourth term in his equation is appreciable throughout a certain
range only, it is not actually non-existent in other parts, and
that, therefore, there is no true mathematical discontinuity.
I  never, however, ventured to assert that the changes occurred
so suddenly as to prove strict mathematical discontinuity; and
I
º
    fail entirely to see how such discontinuity could ever be
proved or disproved by any experiments which were not
absolutely free from experimental error, and which were not
infinite in number. Indeed, those hydrates, the presence of
which in appreciable quantities conditions a particular rate
of change of density &c. between certain points, cannot be
            as being entirely absent from other solutions—a view
which the principles of dissociation and the gradual removal
of such hydrates or substances in the solid or gaseous form
from such solutions necessitate (see Chem. Soc. Trans. 1889,
pp. 22, 23; 1890, pp. 138, 340)—the only statement which we
can make on the strength of experiments is that the amount
of the substances present is inappreciable, or otherwise, b
those experiments.        In the same way the suddenness wit
which a     change   of curvature occurs can only be determined
 within limits comparable with those of the experimental error.
 My “breaks,” in fact, are similar to those which we get in
 most cases of a change of condition, where the practical
existence of the break is beyond doubt, although              absolute     its
abruptness may always           doubted, and could certainly never
                                        be

   As to the uncertain break at 58 per cent. which Prof.
Rücker's equation successfully bridges over,     may point out                        I
that even here my failure to recognize the sensible continuity
of the figure cannot be attributed to any fault in the method,
but to one in the operator.   I invariably used the lath bent

form      I

 142               Mr. S. U. Pickering       on the Densities
will not help us to decide between their respective merits:
but whereas Prof. Rücker's equation is artificial and is a very
improbable representation of physical facts, the parabola is a
form of curve which has been found to express physical facts
“ in the great majority of cases in physics and chemistry.”
(Lupton, loc. cit. p. 421), and for the application of which in
 the present case we have the theoretical considerations ad
 vanced by so high an authority as Mendeléeff”.         Considering,
 moreover, that the mathematical continuity expressed by
 Prof. Rücker's curve does not even help us to assert that there
 is not a change in the nature of the solutions attaining
recognizable dimensions just at the point where the parabolas
                                                         I
indicate that such a change occurs, we can, think, have but
little hesitation in making a choice in favour of the latter.
     Two points of minor importance remain to be noticed. On
   . 310 Prof. Rücker suggests that errors, similar to those
which   I   found in making up solutions from two different lots
of stock acid, may exist in making up different solutions from
 the same stock lot. This,         Ithink, is surely not the case;
 for in   using different samples of acid the results depend on
 the comparison by analysis, or by some other means, of the
strength of the two, and this cannot be done with an accuracy
in any way approaching to that attainable by mixing weighed
quantities of two substances.
     Prof. Rücker alludes to my having omitted certain points
which   I   considered exhibited exceptionally large errors, while
I    insisted on changes dependent on differences of smaller
       ...
 amount.      In dealing with a “ differential” figure, an error in
 one of the experiments affects two consecutive differential
i. oints in the opposite direction, making them too high and too
                    ; and it is only in cases where this appearance
is evident that we should be justified in assuming, provisionally
at any rate, the existence of an exceptional error.          It was
only in such cases that assumed it; but at the same time
                              I                                          I
quoted fully the determinations which               I
                                                   considered to be
erroneous, so that others might use them in whatever way they
thought     fit.  These questionable determinations should,              no
doubt, have been repeated, but          to   do
                                           this    every case would

   Since writing the above my attention has been called to the
fact that Prof. Lunge has questioned the accuracy of my sul
phuric-acid density determinations (Journ. Soc. Chem. Ind.
1890, p. 1017).    His criticism is based entirely on his own
misrepresentation of the facts of the case. My answer to him

chemically equivalent quantities        of different substances will pro
duce the same          effect in solution.   As we proceed to stronger
solutions the molecules get closer together, and the theory launches
out with the bold assertion that Wander Waals's modification of the
law of gases is applicable to the molecules of a dissolved substance
also; and the deviations of the properties of a solution from abso
lute proportionality to the amount of dissolved substance present
are calculated on this assumption, the agreement being in some
cases remarkably good.
   The theory supposes that the molecules of the dissolved substance
remain intact when they enter into solution.             In the case of solu
tions of salts the laws indicated above are not obeyed, and the
explanation given is that the molecules of the salt split up into
their constituent atoms, a view which is supported by many phe
nomena of electrolysis.        Hence the solution contains molecules of
salt and free atoms or “ions” which have been produced by the
dissociation of the salt. No quantitative measurements are given,
because we have no certain knowledge as to the relative amounts
of dissociated and undissociated salt.             Recently Arrhenius has
worked in this direction with some success.
   In this treatise the case of salt-solutions is only treated in a
somewhat superficial manner; indeed it is at this point that the
subject becomes a most difficult one.                One hardly justifiable
assumption is that the solvent remains inert, although the disso
ciation of the salt is effected by                Again, there are chemical

Those who are acquainted with Mr. Gore's previous writings                                                            in
the attractive realm     Sidereal Astronomy will gladly welcome
this new contribution              to of

148                     Notices respecting New Books.
of thirty carefully prepared maps of the principal Star Groups, and
accompanying each one, on the opposite page, a short description
is given of the most interesting objects. We should have liked
to see these descriptions more complete, as there is considerable
blank space left, and Mr. Gore is so much at home amongst stellar
objects that he might readily have utilized it with further valuable
references.    The maps will prove of great utility to everyone who
employs them as a means of becoming acquainted with the con
figuration of the leading Star Groups.          Mr. Gore mentions in his
preface that his “little maps are intended as an aid to the
beginner,” and this intention will doubtless be realized in many
cases; but we hope the student will not feel nonplussed by the
opening paragraph accompanying Map XIII., where it is stated:
 “Aries, the Ram, is the first sign of the Zodiac, or that in which
the Vernal equinoctial point was situated in the time of Hip
 parchus.    Owing, however, to the precession of the equinoxes this
 point has now retrograded into Pisces.” Of course this reads
 simple enough to those well versed in the subject, but it is likely
to prove too technical for mere beginners. On the whole, how
ever, Mr. Gore's book undoubtedly merits commendation.               Many
a  tyro  can spend  an   agreeable   hour in   comparing   the charts with
 the stars seen in the heavens and identifying the various groups as
well as their individual stars. The volume is an example of Mr.
 Gore's well-known accuracy. We hope that, if a second edition is
 called for, the author will include one or two maps of Draco, a
 constellation which abounds in bright stars and which, large and
 straggling though it            is,
                              contains many interesting objects always

Esq., F.G.S.
     The author discusses the conditions that preceded                                         the formation
 of   the Glen Roy Lake, and appeals         rain-map                                          ofScotland              in

support of his contention that the main snow-fall in Glacial times
would be on the western mountains.       He gives reasons for supposing
that, previously to the formation of the lake, the valleys of the
Lochaber lakes were occupied by ice, and that the period of the
formation of the lakes was that of the decay of the last Ice-sheet.
   He supports the correctness of the mapping of the terraces by the
officers of the Ordnance Survey, and shows how the absence of the
two upper terraces in Glen Spean and of the highest terrace in Glen
Glaster simplifies the explanation of the formation of the lakes by
ice-barriers.
   The alluvium of Bohuntine is considered to be the gravel and
mud that fell into the lake from the front of the ice when it stood
at the mouth of Glen Roy during the formation of the two upper
lines.
   During the last stage of the lake, the ice in the valley of the
Caledonian Canal is believed to have constituted the main barrier,
whilst the Corry N'Eoin glacier played only a subordinate part.
   The author suggests the possibility of a débâcle during the drop
of water from the level of the highest to that of the middle terrace;
and in support of this calls attention to the breaking down of the
moraines of the Treig glacier at the mouth of the Rough Burn. He
believes that when the water dropped to the level of the lowest
terrace, it drained away quietly, at any rate until it receded from
Upper Glen Roy.
   In discussing Nicol's objections, he maintains that notches would
not be cut at the level of the cols, and observes that the discrepancy
between the heights of the terraces and those of the cols has pro
bably been increased by the growth of peat over most of the ground
about the watersheds.
   The horizontality of the terraces is stated to be a fact, and cases
are given where waterworn pebbles are found in connexion with the
“roads,” these being especially noticeable in places where the south
west winds would fully exert their influence, and the structure of
the terraces is considered to be such as would be produced at the
margins of ice-dammed lakes.          Further information is supplied
concerning the distribution of the boulders of Glen Spean syenite.
These are found on the north side of the Spean Walley at the
height of 2000 feet above the sea and 1400 feet above the river,
and fragments of the syenite have been carried towards the north
east, north, and north-west.
    In an Appendix, the author discusses Prof. Prestwich's remarks
on the deltas, and his theory of the formation of the terraces.

   The following communications were read:—

    2.  “A  Comparison of the Red Rocks of the South Devon Coast
with those of the Midland and Western Counties.” By Prof. Edward
Hull, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author believes, with Dr. Irving, that the Red Rocks of Devon
shire are representatives of the Permian and Trias which occupy so
large a portion of the district bordering Wales and Salop and which
extend into the Midland Counties, and comments on the remarkable
resemblance between the representative beds on either side of the
dividing ridge of Palaeozoic rocks which underlies East Anglia and
emerges beneath the Jurassic strata in Somersetshire.
    He believes that the breccia forming the base of the series in the
Torquay district is a representative of the Lower Permian division,
but differs from Dr. Irving in assigning the red sandstones and
marls of Exmouth to the Trias, and not to the Permian as that
author has done.        He compares them with the Lower Red and
Mottled Sandstones, and regards the Marls as of local origin, thus
causing the beds to diverge from the normal type.
    The Budleigh Salterton Pebble-beds, with overlying sandstones
and pebbly beds, he assigns to the horizon of the Pebble-beds of
the Midland area, and points out that fossils of Silurian and
Devonian types occur in the pebbles of both areas.
    The Upper Division of the Bunter is well shown at Sidmouth, and
the author takes a calcareous breccia, two feet thick, which is found
in the cliffs, as the basement-bed of the Keuper division.
    3. “Supplementary Note to the Paper on the “Red Rocks of the
Devon Coast-section, Q. J. G. S. 1888.”         By the Rev. A. Irving,
D.Sc., B.A., F.G.S.
    In this note the author accepts Prof. Hull's determination (see
above) of the breccia at Sidmouth as the base of the Keuper, and
discusses the age of the sandstones containing vertebrate remains
discovered   by Messrs. Whitaker, Metcalfe, and Johnston-Lavis.       He
brings forward evidence in support of his view that these are really of
 Upper Bunter age, notwithstanding the character of the organisms.
    He adds new material in support of his contention that the sand
 stones and marls which Prof. Hull assigns to the Lower Bunter are
 really Permian ; but he is inclined to think that the breccias (in part,
 at least) pass laterally into the sandstones, and do not underlie them.
    From this it follows that the break between the Permian and Trias
 of Devon is marked by the absence of the Lower Bunter of the Mid
 lands, and the author quotes remarks of Mr. Ussher in support of his
 view that there is an unconformity at the base of the Pebble-bed.
    In conclusion the author refers to the difficulties of ascertaining
 the exact age of the breccias, and notes that we cannot prove that
 the highest Carboniferous beds are present in Devonshire.            He
 observes that there is no valid reason why the great breccia-sandstone
 series of Devon should not be the true equivalent of the Lower Roth
 liegendes both in time and position in the sequence, and that some
  portions of them may be even older than the Rothliegendes of some

districts. He discusses the evidence furnished by the igneous rocks,
and points out the abnormal position both for the British and Ger
man areas which these would occupy, if the breccias were of Triassic
age.

ON THE CONCORDANCE OF ORTHOBARIC CURVES FOR SOLUTIONS
        AND HOMOGENEOUS LIQUIDS.                BY L. NATANSON.
      Orme Masson, pursuing the line of inquiry started by
PRQ.
  M. van't Hoff with such success, has been able to point out a
remarkable analogy between the systems formed by a liquid and a
saturated vapour, with certain solutions partially soluble in each
other.   In order to put this analogy in its simplest form, let us
assume that vapours are solutions of matter in a vacuum, and
liquids solutions of vacuum in matter; the case of two mutual
solutions in equilibrium will then become the general case, which
will comprise, as a particular case, the ordinary equilibrium of a
liquid in the presence of a saturated vapour.
   From this point of view the author inquires whether it is not
possible to transfer to solutions the well-known propositions of
van der Waals on the fundamental relations which apply to various
bodies in the state of saturated vapour.       For this purpose he has
constructed five “orthobaric   lines,” to use the expression of Ramsay
and Young—that is to say, curves which show the relation of the
volumes of the liquid and of the vapour with the temperature,
even at the limits of saturation.      The five combinations of liquids
which have been chosen are those whose solubility has been inves
tigated by M. Alexejeff, and the thermal expansion of which may
be considered as known.      These five combinations are as follows:—
aniline and   water, aniline and sulphur, isobutylic alcohol and water,
phenol and water, essence of mustard and water. The considera
tion of these curves gave the values of the critical elements, that
is to say the temperature and the volume of unit mass at the
critical point of the solution. These values were then adopted as
new units; and it was found that orthobaric curves referred to the
respective critical elements agree with each other, the differences
peculiar to them having disappeared. To this result another is
attached. The orthobaric curve, which is unique for different
solutions, is the same as that which applies to homogeneous bodies.
This conclusion is corroborated by the calculation of orthobaric
curves for ether, from Ramsay and Young and M. Battelli; for
methylic alcohol and ethylic alcohol, from Ramsay and Young; lastly
for carbonic acid and nitrogen protoxide, from MM. Cailletet and
Mathias; as well as by the detailed comparison of         all
                                                            those curves
with those which have been calculated for solutions.—Bulletin de

published, the available experimental data were insufficient                                       to
satisfactorily test the accuracy      these generalizations.
  Since then the conclusions                          ofof

favourable, the notion of “corresponding” states has received
wide acceptance; and, indeed, the generalizations regarding
corresponding temperatures, pressures, and volumes might
still be true even though the formula on which they were
originally based              some alteration.
    In order to study the relations, for instance, between the
specific volumes of different substances, determinations were
made in the first place at the same temperature, generally at
0° C. ; later on it was considered that the conditions would
be more uniform if the comparison were made at the boiling
º:       of the substances under normal atmospheric pressure.
  t is now, however, usually admitted that in order to obtain
the best results the volumes should be determined at “corre
sponding” temperatures—that is to say, at absolute temperatures
proportional to the absolute critical temperatures of the various
bodies—or at their boiling-points under corresponding pres
sures—the two methods of comparison being, according to
Van der Waals, identical.
    During the last four years I have been engaged in a research
on the vapour-pressures and specific volumes—both in the
liquid state and as saturated vapour—of the following sub
stances:—benzene, fluorbenzene, chlorobenzene, bromoben

                   Generalizations of Van der Waals.          155
employed, and this has been fully described in the Trans.
Chem. Soc. 1891, p. 37. This method is applicable to sub
stances that attack mercury, and from the data it affords the
specific volumes both of liquid and saturated vapour may be
calculated ; it is also available at any temperature up to the
critical point. A modification of the method is described in
the Trans. Chem. Soc. lix. p. 929.
    The object of this paper is to show how far the generaliza
tions of Van der Waals have been verified by the experimental
results.
   If   all the relations were strictly true, it would obviously
make no difference whether the specific (or molecular) volumes
were compared at corresponding temperatures or correspond
ing pressures; but it may be stated at once that it is only in
a limited number of cases that, when the absolute temperatures
are proportional to the absolute critical temperatures,       the
vapour-pressures are also proportional to the critical pressures.
It is therefore necessary to compare the various substances,
not only at corresponding temperatures but also at corre
sponding pressures.       The best mode of procedure would pro
bably be to give the temperatures, pressures, and volumes of
each substance in terms of the critical constants of that body;
but the critical volumes of only a few of the compounds have
been directly determined, and it has therefore been necessary
to compare the various substances with one of them taken as
a standard.      The very simple relations observed between the
four monohalogen derivatives of benzene (Trans. Chem. Soc.
1889, p. 486), and the fact that the constants of fluorbenzene
have been determined up to the critical point, render that
substance the most suitable for the purpose.
   The experimental data and the ratios calculated from them
are given in the following tables.
       I. Critical constants—temperature, pressure, volume.

 already been published (loc. cit.); but there are one or two
 obvious small irregularities, and I have therefore mapped the
ratios against temperature and constructed curves for each
substance (Plate I.).     The smoothed values read from the
curves are given in this paper, and the molecular volumes of
saturated vapour have also been recalculated from the density
ratios. The same method of procedure has been adopted with
the other substances.

  That the relation cannot be strictly true when the critical
pressures are different is obvious, since it is not generally true
that the vapour-pressures at corresponding temperatures are
corresponding pressures.     It is still possible, however, that
the relation may be true for the critical temperatures, pres
sures, and volumes.       Unfortunately,    the critical volumes
have  only  been determined in a few      cases,  but it has been
shown that the ratios of the molecular volumes at correspond

already stated.
   The two substances—methyl alcohol and acetic acid, and
to   asmall extent ethyl and propyl alcohol—are clearly ex
ceptional      their behaviour, and
                  in                        interest    note, it   is       of                  to         in
comparing these substances with fluorbenzene, that while
with acetic acid the ratios of the molecular volumes both of
liquid and saturated vapour are very low, with methyl alcohol
itis only     the liquid state that this
                  in                           observed.   This        is   to   be

may again point to the existence of complex molecules of
acetic acid in both the liquid and gaseous states, but of methyl
alcohol in the liquid state only, except possibly very near the
critical point.
   With ethyl and propyl alcohols the ratios of the molecular
volumes of liquid to those of fluorbenzene are also low, though
not nearly to the same extent as with methyl alcohol.
           Note on      the Determination   of Critical   Constants.
   Of the three critical constants, temperature, pressure, and
volume, the first is the most easily determined, for by em
...i.         heating-agents the vapours of pure liquids boiling
under known pressures, the temperature is perfectly under
control and is easily measured.       Moreover, the presence of a
very small amount of impurity does not influence the critical
temperature of a substance to nearly the same extent as the
critical pressure.
   The critical pressure may also as a rule be determined
without very much difficulty, provided that absence of impurity
is ensured, but this point is of the utmost importance.        In
the case of substances that attack mercury at high tem
peratures, such as carbon tetrachloride and stannic chloride,
the ordinary method of operation requires modification, and
the calculations become more laborious, but otherwise the
 difficulty is not greatly increased.

perature or pressure, as shown in the accompanying diagrams
constructed from the results with ethyl alcohol.
    A very small alteration of temperature, such as 0.1°, at or
just below the critical point, produces a considerable alteration
 in the volume ; therefore in order to obtain a direct reading of
 the critical volume it is necessary that the substance shall be
 exactly at        its
                 critical temperature.

obtained agree very well with those calculated from the
experimental results.      The other substances will be considered
in their order.
    Halogen Derivatires of Benzene.—Accurate determinations
of the volumes of liquid have been obtained only up to 280°,
but the ratios are very nearly constant and are practically
identical at corresponding temperatures and pressures; the
extrapolation may therefore be considered justifiable.           In the
case of chlorobenzene a few approximate determinations have
been made near the critical temperature; they give slightly
higher ratios than those at lower temperatures, and agree
rather more closely with the mean ratio of the absolute
temperatures at corresponding (equal) pressures.
    The molecular volumes of the saturated vapours give
generally higher ratios than those of the liquid; this may
be partly due to experimental error; but as the deviations are
nearly    all   the same direction,
                in                       seems hardly justifiable
                                                 it                                   to
attribute them entirely         this cause.

    Carbon Tetrachloride.—As the observations extend             within        to
   few degrees      the critical temperature, there does not seem
                     of
to abe much room for error.

vapour cannot                              of,             the highest

temperatures are little doubtful owing           slight decomposition

of   the substance     considerable extrapolation would also                          be
necessary.    The ratios for the liquid state give, however, very
nearly straight lines, which may therefore probably              extra         be
polated without much error.
    Ether.—The four curves would evidently                  very close    be
together      at
               the critical  temperature,    but                as
                                                      the results with
the saturated vapour are somewhat irregular              seems best  it               to
rely only upon those with the liquid.

 do not seem      agree well with those for the saturated vapour;

    It will be seen that the values for benzene and acetic acid,
 calculated from the mean ratios, agree very well with those
 directly observed, and this may be taken as evidence in favour
 of the accuracy of the method of direct measurement adopted.
 On the other hand, the calculated values for ether and the
 alcohols are considerably lower than those previously given
by Ramsay and myself. But it may be pointed out that the
critical temperature of ether was almost certainly slightly
underestimated, owing to the employment of the vapour of
 methyl salicylate as a jacket.      There is no reason to suspect
any error in the determination of the critical pressure; and
if the constants for Biot's formula be taken as correct, the
                                                                  º
calculated temperature corresponding to the critical pressure
would be 1944 instead of 1938, and the higher value agrees
well with a more recent determination by Ramsay, who in
this case employed the vapour of quinoline as a                                   The
correction of the critical temperature of ether would give a
lower value to the critical volume.
   Again, Professor Tait has recently made an exhaustive
mathematical investigation of the relations of pressure, tem
perature, and volume of several substances, including ether,

                        Generalizations of Van der Waals.                                  185
 and he has pointed out that the critical temperature is pro
bably a little higher than 1938, and that the critical volume
of this substance is certainly lower than 4 cubic centim., and
is more probably about 3.5 cubic centim., a value that agrees
fairly well with that calculated by the method described.
   In the case of the alcohols the critical volumes given by
Ramsay and myself were estimated by inspection of the
curves representing the relation of the specific gravities of
liquid and saturated vapour to the temperature, and of the
specific volumes to the pressures, and they were admittedly
only approximate values.
   M. Guye has shown (Comptes Rendus, czii. p. 1257) that
an approximate relation exists between the critical tempera
ture, pressure, and volume of a substance and        theoretical       its
vapour-density compared with air. This        expressed      the

             Construction  of Non-Inductive   Resistances.      187
resistance of the glow-lamps cannot be made simultaneously
with the power-test, since to do this would require the intro
duction of an ammeter, and therefore of inductance, into the
circuit, which should be non-inductive.
    Further, carbon is unsuitable for portable resistances on
account of its brittle nature.       Platinoid, on the other hand,
is flexible, has a low temperature-coefficient, and a high
specific resistance, though not of course nearly as high as
that possessed by carbon.         Platinoid therefore appeared to
us to be the best material to employ in the construction of
non-inductive resistances to be used for power-tests.
    It is well known that a wire doubled on itself has a very
small inductance, which approximates to 3-77 times the total
length of the wire in centimetres as the parts approach each
other.     This value can, as Maxwell pointed out, be reduced
by using flat strips instead of round wires; and, if the strips
be bare and be placed vertically, it is clear that the cooling
action will be considerable, so that relatively strong currents
will produce but little rise in temperature or increase of
resistance.
    We therefore decided in 1887 to construct the non-inductive
resistance seen in fig. 1, Plate IV., consisting of twelve plati
noid strips, each 6 metres long,4 centim. wide, and 0.25 millim.
thick.     Each strip is doubled on itself, two layers of carefully
shell-lacqued silk, 0.075 millim. thick, being inserted between
the front and back portions. The whole is bound together by
means of a narrow silk ribbon wrapped round spirally, con
siderable gaps being left between the spires of the silk ribbon
 so that the platinoid should have plenty of free surface for
 cooling.
    For the purpose of expelling moisture from the silk and the
 shell-lac varnish, when the resistance-strips are first put up, a
 current was passed through each strip strong enough to make
 it fairly hot. During this heating frequent short-circuitings
 occurred from rough points of the metal piercing the silk, a
 single layer only of which was originally employed to separate
 the front and back portions.       An additional layer of silk was
 therefore inserted. Trouble was also experienced from the
 rough edges of the metal causing short-circuits; but by cutting
 the silk wider than the metal and by folding the edge of the
 silk over the edge of the platinoid strip, this difficulty was
 Overcome.
    The doubled strips are permanently joined up in sets of
 three, and to the ends of each set are soldered mercury-cups
 and binding-screws.       The four sets of three can be joined up
 in  series, or in parallel, or in parallel-series by bridge-pieces

          thicker wire, it follows that this method of constructing a
                                                    h;
          resistance not only greatly reduces the inductance, but also
          enables a much              current to be carried for a given
          variation of resistance produced   by the current.   Hence for a
          given current and for a given permissible rise of temperature
          finer wire can be used; the coils can therefore be made shorter,
          and the inductance for this reason still further lessened.
             Lastly, even when such right- and left-handed spirals are
          traversed by a direct current, much less disturbance is pro
          duced in a neighbouring delicate galvanometer than if a
          singly-wound spiral resistance be employed ; so that these
          right- and left-handed spirals of bare wire are valuable in the
          construction of resistance-frames for large direct as well as for
          large alternating currents.
             A number of portable resistance-coils have been constructed
          in this way for general use in the laboratories of the Central
          Institution. One of these is seen in fig. 3. It has also been

   The self-induction and time-constant have therefore been
reduced to one twenty-fourth part by sending the currents in
opposite directions round the two, but the method of winding
shown in fig. 5 could not, of course, be employed with the
non-inductive resistances constructed of bare wire for large
currents described in this communication ; since the funda
mental condition—that parts differing much in potential should
not be near one another—would not be fulfilled.

H)    is perpendicular to the diametral plane of the acceleration
(components X, Y, Z), taken with respect to the ellipsoid (17).
    (11), (22), (33), which are the sums of squares, are the
values of the effective mass in the directions of the axes of
reference; while (23), (31), (12), which are the sums of pro
ducts, correspond to products of inertia in Rigid Dynamics,
and may be called “products of mass.”          It may easily be
shown that if r is the      length   of any given radius of the
ellipsoid (17), the effective mass reckoned in the direction of
this radius is Me"/r”. It may also be remarked that even
when the motion is one of pure translation, there will in
general be finite effective couples, as is immediately evident
from (12).

gerald f.   Without entering on the subject        mathematically
(which   Iam unable to do), it may be noticed       that, according
to this view, the aether is made up of interlacing vortex
filaments, the interspaces between which are filled with
quiescent or irrotationally moving liquid.        The network of
filaments is equivalent to a sponge-like compressible solid,
whose pores, however, are completely filled with incompressible
fluid.    The medium, taken as a whole, is equivalent to an
incompressible solid; but as the effectively liquid (i.e. irrota
tionally moving) portion of the medium cannot suffer any
strain which calls up an opposing stress, it appears that in
considering the strain-figure we should have to deal with the
sponge-like compressible solid, made up of vortex-filaments.
    9. Gravitation.—Disregarding      this last speculation, let
 us return to the more general question of strain, and for sim
 plicity take the case when the strain-figure is symmetrical
 about a point O.       So far as this one strain
 figure is concerned, we may, roughly speaking,            Fig.                2.
 divide the medium into two portions, in one
 of which the strain tends to increase, while
 in the other it tends to decrease.         If these
 portions are separated by a single surface, then,
       if
 in the present case of symmetry, this surface A.
  (A)        be spherical.  On one side of A the
  medium will be so strained that a small additional
 strain of the same type would correspond to increased potential
  energy, while on the other side of A a small increase of strain
  would correspond to decreased potential energy.                 If
                                                           the strain
  outside A corresponds to increased potential energy, two distant
  strain-figures will repel one another ; but if the strain outside
  A corresponds to decreased potential energy, two distant
 strain-figures will attract one another.                If
                                                gravitation is to be
  explained in accordance with the theory of this paper, the
  above would seem to indicate the nature of the explanation.
  There must be some type of strain which would of itself, be
  produced in the medium, were it not that in some other
  portion of the medium there would be an accompanying strain
  of a type corresponding to stability.      Perhaps we may also
  vaguely infer why the gravitative attraction exerted by a
  body is proportional to              its
                               mass, for              we

these quantities to be determined by the distribution of strain
in the medium ; it seems possible, indeed, that the greater
part of the effective mass of a strain-figure might reside in
that region where attraction follows the Newtonian law.
   10. Collision.—If we bring the centres of two strain-figures
close together, so that the spheres A intersect sufficiently far,
we shall be partly superposing two strain-distributions of such
a type that the energy increases with the strain, so that re
pulsion may, perhaps, ensue.     Of course this is only a very
rough attempt at explaining the effects of collision, and takes
no account of any deformation which might be produced in the
strain-figures on bringing their centres to such close quarters.
But even were such deformation produced, the results of a
collision might still be of a very simple character. So long
as the condition of § 4 is satisfied, so long, that           the                          is,      as

 difficulty much less if the atom consists of a vortex ring or a
 vortex tangle, for we should then simply have to infer that
 the existing rings or tangles are as they are because they have
 always been so, and that an indefinite variety of rings or
 tangles of intermediate forms and sizes would be a priori
 perfectly possible.       But if the atom consists of one or more
strain-figures, the question becomes: Why do the strain
figures form a discrete series? Now we have conceived a
strain-figure to be a disturbed condition of the medium,
which is of itself in stable equilibrium throughout, and this
immediately imposes an immense restriction on the possible
varieties; since, also, the strains are impressed on a medium
which would otherwise be homogeneous and isotropic, the
conditions essential to stable equilibrium will be the same for
all  strain-figures, provided, that                      is,
                                              that the proximity          the                of
centres of two or more does not disturb their form.                   But at
this point   a  further assumption will              necessary; for
                                                                be        the                if

Thus the possible strain-figures, though infinitely restricted

    14. Formation of Atoms.-As regards the different varieties
of atoms, we may conceive them
of several kinds of       strain-figures.
                                                made up of one kind or
                                               In             -
                                                            Fig. 3.
place of the simpler form of fig. 2 we
might for example imagine a form like
fig. 3, where in the regions C, E the
strain is such that the potential energy
would decrease with increase of strain,
while in the regions B, D the strain                           c
and the potential energy would increase
together. We might also imagine dis-                          D
tributions which were not spherical, in                        E
which case it might happen (§ 4) that
the laws of motion were less simple than those of Newton.
It would not then necessarily follow that an atom consisting
of more than one strain-figure would possess the same complex
dynamical properties, though             I
                                       am not aware of any evidence
that the separate atoms or molecules of a substance move in
accordance with Newton's laws.
   Of course the operation described in § 2 is not intended to
represent the formation of a strain-figure, but merely to show
that the existence of such a distribution is conceivably possible.
If the ultimate fluid had long ago possessed motion of the
most general kind, we might imagine                        its
                                                   present condition                            to
 be  due    the degeneration
              to                        of
                                      that motion into      fine-grained a
turbulence; and              if,the quasi-solid
                                   in                    constituted, the
                                                                    so
existence     strain-figures were possible,
                   of                                 seems not unlikely
                                                               it
that such would       incidentally     have been     formed,    unless, the
motion fulfilled special conditions.              would suggest then,
                                                     I
very tentatively, that           if
                             the distribution      motion  of the ultimate
                                                                         in
fluid had fulfilled certain   special  conditions,  there would have been
as no
                       the universe, and that the eaistence                           of
                         an in

two strain-figures pass through one another.                    seems posIt
sible, too, that      some stage

             may be remarked that, according to the assumptions
of this paper, every motion in             the universe is ultimately due
to  stationary    motion in a      quasi-solid    medium. This medium,
which extends       through         known         all
                                               space,       supposed            (at  is                   to     be
least appreciably) perfect                            in       its

changing distribution                             of

204           Prof. A. W. Rücker on the Density and
Fitzgerald mentioned that in his lectures he had spoken of
matter as possibly travelling through space in the same way
that a drop of water travels through a block of ice. The idea
involved is the same as that which forms the basis of the fore
going pages.    I have availed myself of Professor Fitzgerald’s
criticism to amend some remarks contained in the earlier part
of the paper, and there is just one thing more which I should
like to add. Every opinion expressed in the paper is not to
be taken as an essential part of the theory, and, indeed, the
       I
most can hope from an investigation so obviously incomplete
is that it may prove suggestive to those who are working
at the subject.
XIX.       On the Density and Composition              of Dilute Sulphuric

         paper on the “Densities of Sulphuric-Acid Solutions,”
INwhicha
            appeared in the January number of this Magazine,
Mr.  Pickering  has replied to my criticism of one of his curves,
which was    published  in September (Phil Mag. Sept. 1891,
p. 304).      P ropose as briefly as possible to indicate the
points in which he traverses my arguments, and the reasons
why   I do not think that his conclusions are justified.
   (1) Mr. Pickering objects that my equation is “of a com
plex and highly artificial form.”    The question as to what is
a “complex” expression may be more or less a matter of
opinion.     Ican only say that           I
                                     think Mr. Pickering will
find that  my equation  lends itself to numerical computation
much more easily than
                 sy= a +   ba   + ca” + da:"+ea"+fc"+ga",
                           i.
which he seems to consider comparatively simple.
   He is also probably aware that every time he applies his
bent ruler to the paper, he is employing a curve of which the
equation involves            integrals and is far more complex
than that to which he   objects.
   Of course he might reply that the short portions of the
elastic curve which he uses might be expressed with sufficient
accuracy by simpler approximate formulae.        If this argument
                 I
were valid,    might
results and reduce         lº.
                      point out that he could get still simpler
                            curves to straight lines if he carried
the  process of subdivision further.    It is in general the case
that an  equation  which   represents  a long range of experi
ments will be more complex than one which applies to a
few only. This affords no argument against               use its    as   an

empirical expression of the facts unless the number of con
stants involved be inordinately large.
   This brings me to the second of                         i.
                                         Pickering's arguments.
   (2) The number of constants in my equation is so great that
a close agreement with his results is not surprising.
     I
     reply that it is not disputed that my curve covers a range
greater than that embraced by three, and less than that
embraced by five of his curves. If we assume that each one
of these curves could be expressed with sufficient accuracy by
means of approximate formulae each of which involved two
disposable constants only, it follows that Mr. Pickering
                                       .
expresses by the aid of 6 and 10 constants          respectively
ranges of which the first is somewhat less, and the second
somewhat greater, than that which          cover by means of 7      I
constants. As the      assumptions                        I
                                      have made are extremely
favourable to Mr. Pickering, this shows that he cannot claim
any superiority on this
   (3) Mr. Pickering objects to the numbers given by those
terms in my equation which occurred to me first being
brought into harmony with experiment by means of another
term.
   What would he think        when      if,
                                      computer had noticed that

         was                          better result could      a                                       be

part of the representation of the experiments, not a “hump”
upon a fundamental circle.
   The only case in which Mr. Pickering's point of view is
allowable is that in which the range expressed by the curve
assumed to be fundamental is very much greater than that
over which the assumed disturbance extends.                In the case of
my equation this is not                        so.

                                       have fused into one the four
 curves which would have been necessary to cover the range
 considered ; but the condition still holds, that an overlap
  at the extremities about equal to half the range of one of
 Mr. Pickering's curves is adequate.
     Mr. Pickering finally finds seventeen breaks between 0 per
 cent. and 100 per cent. ; i. e. he divides the curve into
 eighteen parts, the average range of which is 5.5 per cent.
 Half of this is 2.7 per cent., and the overlaps of my curve are
 2.5 per cent. and 4 per cent. at the two ends respectively.
     It is true that the distance between the breaks under con
 sideration is considerably over the average for the whole
 range ; but that no argument can be based on this is proved
 by the fact that in one case (viz. between 72.8 per cent. and
 78 per cent.) it is a little less than the average.
    As to Mr. Pickering's argument in the footnotes on p. 138,
 in which he urges the uncertainty of his own observations in
 support of the view that the end of my curve may be nearer
 to a break than appears from the numbers he himself quotes,
 I  can only say, that a research cannot be propped up by                                         its
 own uncertainty.
 I     have discussed these arguments         Mr. Pickering because
                                                         of
    wish,      as    possible,
                         as                     his own ground, but

              far                 meet him
I I must frankly say that         not think the discussion can with
                                        I
 advantage         carried further, and
                    be                       hope that   I  will not              he
 think that     Iadmit the  validity     any  further arguments
                                                    of                                            he
 may adduce         if  I     do
                         not answer them.
     No definite mathematical method for deciding how the
 results   of   group
                a         experiments can best

 analytically respresented exists.
     Hence the discussion becomes        wearisome argument
                                                     a                                       as   to
 how   a  ruler may      held, whether curves have “humps” and
                               be
 the   like.
 I   have answered                 Mr. Pickering's arguments                 on   such points
 because   Iwished    the end      at
                                 take   wider point to       a                          of   view
 without being charged with having evaded them.
   The state            of
                 the question appears    me now               to                       to    be   as
 follows:–
    Mr. Pickering claims                    to
                                have established the existence                                    of

 lative, but   would avowedly take months
                                                                   it. to
                                                 examine                                it   in
 minute detail.     have therefore sampled
                         I                           took what              I                     I
 have  every reason      believe Mr.
                                   to  Pickering  considers                                  to   be
 the best part    his work, the determination
                        of                         the densities.      of

208                 Composition of Dilute Sulphuric Acid.
    I chose   that one of the four curves which appeared to me
º:
(judging from Mr. Pickering's figures) to be based on ob
                                   i.
servations which were especially free from abnormal errors.
    I chose that part of         curve which passed through the
               corresponding to the hydrate which Mr. Pickering
  as isolated, and a range which is about one third of the
whole. As the result there are now extant three representa
tions of the part of the curve which                 I
                                           studied :- —
    (1) Mr. Pickering's drawings, which show four discon
tinuities.
    (2) My curve, which Mr. Pickering frankly admits agrees
with the “experimental results just as satisfactorily as                           #.
own drawings do ’’ (p. 136).
    (3) Mr. Fickering has himself put forward a new solution
 (footnote, p. 141) in which he divides the range into two
parts by means of two curves, which agree with my single
curve so closely that he himself states “that the magnitude of
the error will not help us to decide between their respective
merits.”
    Now amid all the discussion as to whether the results are
best represented by continuous or discontinuous curves, one
thing is certain.        Any peculiarity in a curve on which
argument is founded must be proved to be outside the error
of experiment. No weight can be attached to a representa
tion which is not unique in the sense that no other is com
patible with the observations when          allowanceall  made for       is
experimental error.       Mr. Pickering's first solution (the four
break one)         not unique.
                    is            He has himself offered another
(one break) and        have contributed

                                                 a                                      of
which     byhis own admission are such “that the magnitude       the               of
error will not help        decide between their respective merits.”

                              to
     Put briefly, the observations, accurate and numerous
as   they are, are not accurate enough and not numerous
enough          decide whether the 18° density curve
               to                                                 not    is
                                                                               or

                                                 per cent. This                         is
what    I claimed       have established, and Mr. Pickering has
                         to

                            producing    second solution

 conclusion,    I have previously expressed the opinion that Mr.

travel along the straight line from G towards E under very
peculiar conditions.   Apart from the action of the walls of
the containing vessel, and of suspended nuclei, the path from
G to F must be followed. The path from G to E implies that
the vapour at G is in contact with the liquid in mass.   This
is by supposition not the case ; and the passage in question
 could only be the result of foreign matter whose properties
happened to coincide with those of the liquid. If the walls
attract the vapour less than the vapour attracts itself, they
cannot promote condensation, and the path H G F must be
pursued.       In the contrary case condensation must begin
before G is reached, although it may be to only a limited
extent.     Probably the latter is the state of things usually met
with in practice. So soon as the walls are covered with a
certain thickness of liquid, the path coincides with a portion
of G E C, and the angle at G is only slightly rounded off.
    Similar considerations apply at the other end of the straight
course.   If    the liquid be expanded through C, it will not, in
   eneral, pass along CE, but will continue to pursue the curve
    D, and will even attain the limit D, if the attraction of the
walls upon the liquid be not less than that of the liquid upon
itself. In    the contrary case separation will suddenly occur at
a   point upon    the wall, a bubble of vapour will be formed, and
a   point on the straight line C E will be attained. . It is thus
scarcely conceivable that a fluid should follow the broken
course A B C E G H without some rounding of the corners, or
else of overshooting the points C, G, with subsequent precipi
tation upon the line C E G.
    A very important question is the position of the line C G.
Maxwell" showed that inasmuch as the area of the curve
represents work performed at a constant temperature, it must be
 the same for the complete course as for the broken one. The
 line C G is therefore so situated as to cut off equal areas above
 and below.
     This discussion is of course quite independent of the precise
 form of the relation between p and v. All that is necessary
 is such a modification of Boyle's law at great densities as will
 secure the fluid against indefinite collapse under the influence
 of its self-attraction.
   We will now pass to the question of the transition from
liquid to vapour, still supposing the strata to be plane. This
is a problem considered by Maxwell in his article upon
“Capillary Action” in the Encyclopædia Britannica f; but

       In

where p is not varying.    The final result, which appears to
be arrived at without  any  assumption as to the physical con
nexion between   p and p, is thus devoid of significance.

It is po-sible that a graphical process would be found suitable.
Equation (14) determines the curvature at any point of the
curve representing the relation between p and z in terms of
the coordinates and the slope.
   When the relation between p and z is known, the calcula
tion of the surface-ten-ion is a matter of quadratures. Probably
the simplest way of con-idering the question is to regard the
free surface as spherical (liquid within and vapour without),
and to calculate the difference of pressures.

This is the value for the excess of vapour-pressure in equi
librium with a convex surface that is given in Maxwell's
“Heat”     as a deduction from Sir W. Thomson's principle.
   The  application   of this principle may be extended in another
direction.     When liquid rises in a capillary tube open above,
the more attenuated vapour at the upper level is in equilibrium
with the concave surface, and the more dense vapour below is
in equilibrium with the plane surface of the liquid. But, as
was pointed out in the former paper, the rise of liquid is not
limited to the height of the meniscus.          Above that point the
walls of the tube are coated with a layer of fluid, of gradually
diminishing thickness, less than the range of forces, and
extending to an immense height. At every point the layer of
fluid must be in equilibrium with the vapour to be found at the
same level.
                                                        i.
               The data scarcely exist for anything like a pre
cise estimate of the effect to be expected, but             argument
suffices to show that a solid      body   brought   into contact with
vapour at a density which may be much below the so-called
point of saturation will cover itself with a layer of fluid, and
that this layer may be retained in some degree even in what
passes for a good vacuum.           The fluid composing the layer,
though denser than the surrounding atmosphere of vapour,
cannot properly be described as either liquid or gaseous.
   In our atmosphere fresh surfaces, e.g. of split mica or of
mercury, attract to themselves at once a coating of moisture.
In a few hours this is replaced, or supplemented, by a layer of
grease, which gives rise to a large variety of curious pheno
mena.     In the case of mica the fresh surface conducts elec
tricity, while an old surface, in which presumably the moisture
has been replaced by grease, insulates well.
XXI.     Some    Experiments with a Platinum Pyrometer on the
    Melting-points of Gold and Silver.         By H. L. CALLENDAR,

          paper which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine
IN fora July    1891   I alluded to some experiments I had made
with a   platinum   pyrometer    on the melting-point of silver, and
stated that the readings of these instruments were constant to
a tenth of a degree at temperatures above 1000° C.
   Through the kindness of Prof. Roberts-Austen I have
recently had an opportunity of making some further experi

    Pyrometer on the Melting-points of Gold and Silver.                      221
ments on the melting-points of gold and silver at his laboratory
at the Royal Mint.    Professor Roberts-Austen himself sug
gested most of the experiments, and verified some of the
observations. The results are interesting, not only as con
firming his experiments, but also as showing the applicability
of the platinum pyrometer to the accurate observation of small
changes in the freezing-points of alloys at high temperatures.
   The pyrometer used was constructed as described in my
previous paper.       It had a scale of 1 centimetre to the degree,
and the    galvanometer      was so sensitive that it was possible to
read the scale with certainty to a tenth of a degree at 1000°C.
   The first experiment was an observation of the freezing
point of a specimen of gold containing as impurity a small
percentage (0.05) of silver, which Prof. Roberts-Austen has
shown to have very little effect in lowering the freezing-point,
as it possesses very nearly the same atomic volume *.                It
probably tends to crystallize out, when present in small
quantities, isomorphously with the gold.
    About 10 ounces of gold were melted in a clay crucible in a
small Fletcher oxygen furnace and allowed to cool.                 The
                                                                             .
temperature of the metal was observed to fall rapidly till the
freezing-point was reached.           It then remained steady to a
tenth of a degree for a minute or two at pt = 902°2 (on the
platinum scale) while the metal was solidifying.             The
was then    again  melted and well stirred and another reading
was taken.       The result found was pt = 902°3, differing by
   f
only a tenth of a degree from the preceding.
       order to test the effect of the addition of silver in lower
ing the freezing-point the mass was well heated, and 0.5 per
 cent. of silver was added to             it.rough observation taken
                                                A

                                      =        The metal was again
 cautiously melted and continuously stirred while cooling.
 An observation         the freezing-point gave

the fineness   which was about 99.9 per cent. The freezing

observed.      was noticed that the silver began

224            Mr. Callendar               on Erperiments with a                       Platinum
Le Chatelier            has adopted                for the graduation of his thermo
couples the value 945° C.
    Ihave myself made some direct experiments on the freezing
point of silver by means of air-thermometers with small bulbs,
about 2 cubic centim, capacity, both of platinum and por
celain. These experiments point to a similar result, but
cannot be considered very satisfactory.       The platinum oc
cludes  gas, and the glaze  of the  porcelain  cracks so that the
material becomes porous.                               I
                               hope shortly to be able to make
some bulbs of fused silica, which is a far more refractory
material, and ought to give better results.
        If
      we take for the present the value 94.5°C., and assume
that the coefficient 8 in formula (d) is of the form (a+bt),
we find for this pyrometer a = 2.050, b=-00065. Assu
ming these values, we find for the freezing-point of gold the
figure t-1037°C.
   This is lower than the usually accepted figure 1045° C.,
which rests mainly on the experiments of Violle; but
                                                                                                           if,

   To facilitate observations, the apparatus was so arranged
that small changes of temperature could be followed and
recorded by watching the movements of a spot of light
reflected  by the galvanometer-mirror on to a scale". The
instrument was adjusted so that a deflexion of 40 millim. on
the scale was equivalent to 10° Pt.
   The silver was melted in the usual way and well stirred.
The resistances in the box were adjusted approximately to the
balance.     Readings of the position of the spot of light on the
scale were taken at intervals of 10 seconds as the mass cooled.
These readings were plotted in the form of curves, as shown
in Plate V., giving a continuous record of the cooling.
   The uppermost of the curves, No. 1, is the record of the
cooling of silver nearly free from oxygen. The temperature
fell rapidly to 830°, the normal freezing-point.             It  then
remained stationary to a tenth of a degree for about two
minutes and a half. The lower part of the silver having by
this time completely solidified while the upper part was still
partially liquid, the temperature began to fall, slowly at first,
and after about two minutes, when the whole mass was solid,
very rapidly.     A little spitting was noticed between 810° and
805°   Pt., but it was extremely slight and faint.
   The silver was then remelted and heated up to about
890° Pt.      Oxygen was blown through it for about 30 or 40
seconds.     This time the temperature fell to 826°, as shown
in curve No. 2, before it began to freeze.             The tempera
ture remained     nearly  stationary at first, falling  less than half
a degree in the first minute.         It then began to fall more
rapidly.     Spitting commenced at about 814°, and became
very violent between 810° and 805°.          It is evident from an
inspection of the curve that much heat was evolved during the
j.
spitting, since the rate of cooling decreased considerably when
     spitting was at a maximum.         Shortly after the spitting
*
ceased the temperature began to fall at the normal rate, as in
curve No. 1.
   The silver was then remelted with a reducing-flame, and
another record of cooling was taken without the addition of
            The curve proved to be an exact repetition of
  o. 1.
  The silver was then heated to 870° Pt., and more oxygen
passed for about a minute and a half.   To my surprise, on
cooling, it began to freeze at 828°8, as shown in curve 3,

   Pyrometer on the Melting-points of Gold and Silver.             227
method at the Mint, in conjunction with Professor Roberts
Austen, on the effect of gold dissolved in silver.  We found
that the addition of 0.6 per cent. of gold raised the freezing
point of silver by about 0°2 C. A further addition of
0.6 per cent. raised the freezing-point 0°6 C. in all. A
further addition of 1.2 per cent., making 2.4 per cent. in all,
raised the freezing-point 1°3 C.       It is interesting to observe
that the effect of  gold  on silver is similar to that of silver on
gold, and forms an exception to the general rule.            It might
have been expected, a priori, that the addition of 1:3 atoms of
gold per 100 of silver would have lowered the freezing-point
 by about 17°C.; instead of which, a small but clearly marked
rise was observed.     Silver, as shown above, when dissolved in
gold, produces a similarly slight but distinctly appreciable
fall.   It may be remarked that the rise produced by gold in
silver bears nearly the same proportion to the interval
between their freezing-points (945° and 1037°) as the num
ber of atoms of gold present bears to the number of atoms of
silver.
   As a further experiment, aluminium was added to the mass
in proportion (about 0.6 per cent.) sufficient to form, with
the gold already in the silver, the alloy Auðl, which Roberts.
Austen has shown to possess most interesting and remarkable
properties. The mass was well stirred, and a curve of cooling
was taken, shown by the dotted line (No. 6) in Plate V. The
temperature fell to 819° Pt., where it remained quite stationary
 for about a minute.         It then fell slowly for about two
minutes, before the normal rate of cooling was reached.
The lowering of the freezing-point 12:3°C. is rather less than
that required by theory for a solution of 1-3 molecules of
AuAl2 in 100 of silver; but it was observed that an appre
ciable quantity of the alloy sublimed about the mouth of the
 furnace and on the stem of the pyrometer.        It is also doubtful
whether the mass was perfectly homogeneous.            The extent to
which the freezing-point was lowered would, however, appear
 to indicate that this was a true case of solution.
    From want of sufficient metallurgical knowledge,           I
                                                               cannot
pretend to interpret these results more fully.       I   am induced
to publish them, incomplete as they are, rather as an illustra
tion of the degree of accuracy attainable by the use of platinum
pyrometers, and in the hope that, in more experienced hands,
they may lead to really valuable results.
  I   have also tested one of these pyrometers in molten cast
iron raised to a temperature considerably above          its melting
point. As the mass cooled     it  assumed  a   pasty condition,   and

228                           Notices respecting New Books.
no well-defined freezing-point could be detected.    The iron,
however, was of very inferior quality, and by no means homo
geneous.    The glaze on the porcelain tube was attacked by
the iron, but the pyrometer was otherwise uninjured and
showed no change of zero.      It should certainly be possible
with these instruments to observe the effects of various im
purities in altering the melting-point even of steel, and it is
probable that the results in this case might be of some value
to manufacturers.

it does not seem quite clear whether friction is due to Carnot's

the same. A general haziness as to this question lends a flavour

the way in which Carnot's Theorem is dependent on our inability
to deal individually with the irregular heat-energy of molecules,
this view is kept quite in the background and the subject is based
upon a set of scholastic generalities that throw very little light on
the physical basis of Thermodynamics.       Such presentations have
in the  past  rather tended to obstruct than advance Science. And
yet the book is suggestive and interesting.    Even if it did no more

almost universal adoption of the latter scale in recent years seems
to call for a short note to this passage.
    The chapters on waves and radiation form a good connecting
link between the molar and molecular phenomena. An error of
the previous editions is repeated on p. 229 of the present one,
where the quantity Q of the mathematical expression is stated to
be the velocity of propagation of the wave, this latter being really
equal to Qv.
    In molecular physics many important advances have been made,
and Lord Rayleigh has added some valuable notes on the theory
of imperfect gases and of liquids, and on capillarity.              Indeed, he
may be said to have written a brief history of Laplace's capillary
coefficient K, which represents the internal pressure in a gas or
liquid resulting from the mutual attractions of                 molecules, and      its

which these bodies experience in the electrical or in the magnetic
field.
   Experiments which Quincke * made with                           liquids in the electrical
field have shown that substances which                             have almost the same
dielectric constant have a totally different                          behaviour as regards
change of volume t.   This seems to favour                         the supposition that at
any rate in this case k" is an independent                         constant     characteristic
of individual substances. Hence for these substances Poisson's (1)
or Betti's (2) formula, which appears to connect k with k in a
perfectly definite manner defined by formulas (3) and (4), seems to
be in disaccord with experiment; for these substances k must be
regarded simply as an empirical constant.
   It follows further from these considerations that the application
by many authors of Poisson's formula to the determination of the
fraction g of the volume actually occupied by the molecules is only
allowable in the case of gases, but for other substances is wanting
in accuracy.—Wied. Annalen, vol. xliv. p. 173.
        ONTHE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE OF GAS BATTERIES.
                   BY GERTSCHO MARKOVSKY.
  The results of these experiments may be stated in the following
terms:—
   1. The electromotive  force of a platinum plate coated with
hydrogen against a platinum plate in sulphuric acid freed from
gas, has not the value which has been previously assumed.      For
hydrogen the force is smaller, that is = 0 646 volt and for oxygen
greater = 0-374 volt.
  2. Hydrogen            and oxygen gases developed                    electrolytically    act
just in the same way as when formed by purely chemical action.
   3. By the addition of solution of platinum sulphate the electro
motive force of an oxygen element is diminished, while that of a
hydrogen one increases, and in such a manner that the electro
motive force of an oxygen-hydrogen element is not changed by the
addition of solution of platinum sulphate.
   4. The electromotive force is independent of the change of
density and temperature of the gas introduced.
   5. Carbon electrodes behave in a gas element, or when polarized
by a current, differently from platinum electrodes.—Wiedemann's
Annalen, vol. xi., 1891.

  The author    gives  the following extract from a longer memoir
which is shortly  to appear.
  By membranous bodies he understands such bodies as are
capable of forming a membrane, which can be used for                 pur                                   all
poses for which membranes can           applied. To these belong, for

238       Prof. Bonney : Petrological Notes on         the  Euphotide
    These erratics”, which abound between Saas and the end
of the Allalein glacier, are derived from the extremity of a
long curving spur, which runs eastward from the summit of
the Allaleinhorn (13,235 feet) and divides the névés of the
Allalein and Hochlaub glaciers. This is indicated on the Swiss
 map by the figures 3150 m. (= 10,334.8 ft.). On the Geo
 logical Map (Blatt XXIII.) it is coloured “serpentine,” but
 this term is used by the surveyors with singular elasticity.
 For instance, in the neighbourhood of the Saasthal it denotes
not only true serpentine, of which there is a fair amount, but
also gabbro, and a rather hard schistose rock, which contains
 green hornblende, chlorite, epidote, and probably felspar,
 often garnet, sometimes glaucophane, and so has no more
 claim than a diorite to be called a serpentine. The more
 obvious point of departure for this spur is the little inn at the
 Mattmark See, from which I think it might be reached in
 about three hours' walking ; but it can be visited without
 much difficulty from Saas Fee. For guidance by this route
 and for much valuable aid in collecting these notes                   I am
indebted to my friend Mr. Jas. Eccles, F.G.S., who had
already made       i.  expedition in 1890 f.
    This ridge of gabbro is completely surrounded by snow and
ice, beneath which, however, it is doubtless linked to the spur
 of the Allaleinhorn. Evidence of this may be found in two
small knolls or heaps of boulders which protrude from the
snow, one slightly on the Allalein side, the other on the Hoch
                                                                              |

             have been long known to me, and in 1881 endeavoured to
reach the ridge.                   I
                    Unfortunately was obliged to turn back and have had
to wait ten years for another opportunity.
    + There are two routes from Saas Fee (5900 feet).        The one passes
up the right bank of the Fee glacier till it reaches a “col” (9872 feet)
beneath the precipices of the Egginerhorn.      This leads on to the névé of
the Kessjen glacier.    Crossing this we make (roughly in a S.S.E. direc
tion) for a gap in the bounding ridge, on the left of which is a mass of
light-coloured   calc-mica schist.    Descending from this gap (probably
about 10,095 feet) we can scramble down along the rocks in the direction
of the Hinter Allaleinhorn until it becomes easier to take to the neve of
                                             Aiº,
the Hochlaub glacier, and we cross this to the gabbro ridge.—The other
route turns to the right
                          <U+017F>º    before reaching the first col, ascends the
snow slopes of the ridge from the Hinter                   obliquely so as to
get above some ugly séracs ; then, after crossing a bergschrund, mounts
to the summit of the “grat.”     This is followed to near the base of the
peak itself, when it becomes easy to descend to the névé of the Hochlaub
  lacier.   We went by the former way and returned by the other; this
is higher (being by aneroid—which that day gave good results—10,800
feet) but a little more direct.      It presents no difficulties to persons
familiar with Alpine excursions; on either route a rope is needful. We
were about 43 hours going and 3 hours returning, without hurrying.

laub side” of the flattened snow-saddle between the two glacier
basins.     These knolls, as will presently be described, also
consist of a variety of gabbro. The ridge of which we speak
rises slightly from beneath the snow, and runs pretty nearly
on a level for about a couple of hundred yards, falling
steeply on either side towards the descending surface of the
glaciers. At the end, which falls no less steeply, it may be
200 feet above the icef.           Mr. Eccles, in 1890, also found
gabbro in the above-named spur of the Allaleinhorn, but the
mass of it appeared to be small.             I think these are          the                             all

an ophitic structure may sometimes be observed.         The struc
ture resembles, though it is less definite and on a coarser
scale, that figured on plate xliii. in Mr. Teall's ‘British Petro

Very common.
    It must not, however, be supposed that these different
types can be separated by hard and fast lines. In the same
block one variety may pass into another, such as (3) into (5),
or even (4) into (5), by the gradual incoming of smaragdite,

occasionally loses this schistose structure and becomes nor

Occasionally also the rock becomes slightly streaked                                           or

of opacite, or a grain or a cluster of granules of the honey

attention has often been called by writers on glaucophane

sometimes roundish grains, sometimes fairly idiomorphic”, a
pale straw-colour with a tinge of red, often so full of enclo
sures as to have a “dusty” aspect, but sometimes with clear
parts. Some of these enclosures resemble films, and are
doubly refracting, being possibly one of the constituents of
the “saussurite.”    In one of the specimens the garnets are
arranged in a kind of ring about the patches of glaucophane ;
the latter, however, occasionally interposes between them and

    We may now pass on to inquire to what cause the slight
foliation, commonly perceptible in one variety of this rock
(No. 4), should be attributed.
    The smaragdite-euphotide, it may be remarked, is a rock of
exceptional hardness and toughness, breaking, apparently,
with equal difficulty in                  directions; but the variety

    Yet this region,  as a whole, undoubtedly has been subjected
to very   severe  pressure,  of which frequently there are con
spicuous indications—for in some places serpentine has been
crushed into a slaty schist, other rather less basic rocks into
chloritic or hornblendic schists, granitoid rocks into slabby
gneisses with “sheen surfaces,” &c."
   Still, among these euphotides, certain specimens of those
containing green hornblende (No. 4) present structures which
make it possible that the mass was somewhat modified by
crushing.     This is the case with the small specimen from
the  spur  of the Allaleinhorn, given to me by Mr. Eccles; also,
though to a less extent, in sundry specimens collected by
myself, one from the ridge, another from one of the bosses.
But in the majority of the boulders of this type could find                       I
no direct evidence in favour of their slight “flaser” structure
being due to this cause, while occasionally their structures
seemed readily explicable by fluxional movements, as is the
case with certain of the gabbros at the Lizard.        Hence, while
I  should admit that this       euphotide   had been occasionally
 modified by subsequent pressure, I should infer that on the
whole it has done little more than modify structures which
 were original, and that these have been generally unaffected
                                                                 -
 by the process of mountain-making.
.
    From these observations it follows indirectly that gabbro is
      no means a promising subject for “dynamo-metamor
 phism,” and to attribute a flaser structure to this agency,
 when no mark has been left on neighbouring and less obstinate
 rocks, is to quit induction for hypothesist.
    Two other matters, in connexion with these boulders, appear
 to me to call for a few remarks in conclusion                           :-

 the boulders   containing   smaragdite   are more abundant than
 those     which the dull green hornblende dominates (4). But,
          in
 as I  have stated, this    not the case
                                  is          the ridge itself.

gated in one direction only the complete solution is given,
and the general solution for propagation in both directions is
obtained in finite terms for a system of different forms of
channel.      One of these forms of channel is peculiarly
interesting in respect of the fact that long waves of any kind
are propagated along it without change of form : in               other                               all
forms   of channel long waves change           form      they advance.

propagation, the general solution takes               specially simple         a
form, and    I have devoted      section       a discussion.        to   its
    Perhaps the most important application             the theory                 of                         is   to

In   the treatise       “Tides and Waves” the application was
 made   by  Airy  with great success.      As, however, the results
 were obtained from approximations only,               have thought            I                                  it

velocity parallel to the length of the channel, great in com
parison with the other two components of the displacement
and velocity.    It is clear that this imposes a certain limitation
on the form of the cross section of the channel : near the
surface the inclination of the sides to the vertical must not be
so great as to occasion too great a transverse motion, as the
surface rises and falls between wave-crest and hollow.            In
obtaining (4) the exact assumption made is that the vertical
component of the acceleration of any particle is very small
in comparison with the free acceleration g due to gravity.
   As an example, suppose that the form of the surface is
       by a curve of sines or similar curve. Then it is clear
fi."
that, to satisfy the conditions, the height of the waves, and
the variation in the breadth of the channel between wave-crest
and trough, must be very small in comparison with the length
of the wave; and it may also be seen without much difficulty
that the ratio of the wave-height to the wave-length must be

      2. The Propagation       of Wares in one Direction only:
                             General Solution.
   The most important problems in wave-motion are those in
which waves are propagated in one direction only.          When
this limitation is imposed, the complete solution of the problem
of the propagation of long waves may be obtained as follows:–
   Let x and 8 be functions of z, as yet undetermined ;
assume for a unidirectional solution,
-                            z=F0(a!—at).

be taken as the origin, then the form and motion generally of
the advancing waves will again be given by the equations (7)

                      (9) we see that it will be determined
by the consideration of the normal velocity of flow in the
channel independent of the wave-motion. Thus, if when no
waves    are     being propagated along the channel, there is a
uniform flow in it in the direction of the axis of r, the velocity
being U, then, if we regard the wave-motion as such as not in
itself producing a permanent flow, we must have

                 3. The Channel of Uniform Propagation.
    The solution of the problem of the propagation of long
waves in one direction only which we have obtained affords
little or no clue to the treatment required for the general case
of propagation in both directions. The complete solution of
this latter problem in finite terms is in general unattainable;
but, as we shall see immediately, there is an infinite variety of
forms of cross section for which such solutions may be obtained.
Of these forms of section, however, there is one which, from
its  special interest and simplicity, deserves     separate dis                       a

generally be taken.
     By means of these results we can easily see the chief
characteristics of the tidal ebb and flow in such a river or
estuary.     From (34) it follows that the height of rise and
fall is the same at all stations on the river as that of the
oceanic tide at the mouth, but the rise and fall is not simple
harmonic except at the mouth. We see also that high water
occurs later at stations up the river than at the mouth, the
lag, which is simply proportional to the distance from the
mouth, being less for high than for low tides, and also less
the less the natural flow in the river : the same is true for
the time of low water, but the lag is greater and it is greater
 for high than for low tides; hence the interval from low
 water to the high water following is less than the interval
                       -
 from high water to the following low water. In fact, from
  (34), the interval from high water to the succeeding low
 water, at a station at distance # from the mouth, is

 two intervals increases directly as the distance from the

 also greater the greater the natural velocity q of the stream.

observed phenomena of the tides in rivers.             Most of them, in

It is clear, therefore, that the subdivision obtained by Airy
must be due to his having extended his interpretation of his
approximation to a distance at which it ceased to give a fair
account of the motion. In fact, returning to (34), if we put

                                           equation, which shows a
 subdivision of the wave at a sufficiently advanced station.
 This tracing, with a brief summary of Airy's results, is repro
duced by G. H. Darwin in his article “On Tides,” in the
 Encyclopædia Britannica.       Airy has further carried (46) to a
 third approximation, which may easily be obtained from (34)

may even be a subdivision into three.           All this, however,

of a series of sines of multiple arcs, when due regard is not
paid to the limits within which only it can be regarded as an

indicate a subdivision into as many waves as it contains terms;

                   that this subject has not yet been taken up
        scientifically; yet it is very important. The practical
 treatment of the                subject of struts is in a very unsatis
 factory condition ; and it is mainly due to this that, of two
 bridges designed for the same spans and loads, by two
 engineers, one has sometimes more than twice the weight of
 the other ; and in                 all
                             probability the one       least weight         of                             is   in

 stresses to which any part of the strut or tie-rod is subjected.
 In many practical cases ze=2, and then I/3, is called Z, the
 strength-modulus of the section.
    We can therefore find the strength and stiffness of any
 strut of uniform section fixed or free at either or both ends
 when loaded laterally in any way whatever.
    When, as in many practical cases, it is allowable to take an
 approximate value for p(r), and especially when the lateral
 loading and initial shape are such that the strut is symme
 trical about the axis of y, the work can be greatly simplified
 by not introducing such terms as r and t. In the symmetrical
 cases such terms as b, and 8 are absent from the expressions,
 and Mo-M1.        If the ends are not fixed, Mo-M1= –Fh.

   Now it might be supposed that in the second direction the
strut is as if fixed at the ends; but the pins are very short,
and the resultant load is certainly not applied axially, and it
is safer to assume that in this direction also the strut is as if
hinged at the ends.                       I
                             assume this, although perhaps from
the  possibility of accidental untrue loading we ought to go
further in this safe direction and assume that the strength of                                             i.

I   raised against those arguments which had previously been
used to support this formula (see Chem. Soc. Trans. 1878,
    409). Mr. Vernon's paper has recently appeared in extenso
in this Magazine (vol. xxxi. p. 48.
                                                –
    The evidence adduced by me (Chem. Soc. Trans. 1879,
p. 654) in favour of the formula Mn,0], was
    1. That the dissolution of manganese dioxide in hydrochloric
acid results in the (almost) immediate liberation of two
atoms of free chlorine for every two of loosely combined
chlorine present in the higher chloride formed, according to
the equation
           2MnO, + 8HC]     – Mn2Cls + Cl, + 4H2O,    - -  -  (1)
instead of resulting in the liberation of no free chlorine, as
might be the case if the tetrachloride were formed:
                2MnO, + 8HCl    – 2MnOl, + 4H,0.     -  - -   (2)
This fact was established by finding that of the total available
                                           ºil;
 (i.e. free + loosely combined), chlorine present, one half
might be removed from the liquid very              (in about half
an hour) by a rapid current of air, whereas many days are
required to remove the remaining half in the same way, this
second half being evidently present not as free chlorine, but
as the result of the gradual decomposition of the higher
chloride:
                       Mn2Cl6 - 2MnOl,  + Cla.
    2.  That although a lowering of temperature increases the
stability of the higher chloride, the amount formed tends
towards a limit which no further lowering of temperature will
modify, this limit being that at which every two atoms of
manganese      present  as the higher chloride retain 2 and not
4 atoms   of loosely combined chlorine,
                 Mn2C1,0l., not Mn2Cl3,Cl4.
The amount of loosely combined chlorine was estimated by
decomposing the higher chloride with excess of water : if
MnCl, were formed, the whole of the dioxide taken might be
recovered,

The maximum amount recovered was 47 per cent. at –20°,
the results plotted against temperature being represented by
a curve which had at this point become nearly parallel to the

very materially increased by adding a small quantity of
manganous chloride to the acid used to dissolve the dioxide ;
this might be the case if the higher chloride were Mn,Cls,

but could not be the case if the higher chloride were MnOl.
One molecular proportion of the manganous chloride increased
the amount of higher chloride from 45 to 80 per cent., and
there was a very marked change of curvature at this point, it
requiring another 4 molecules of the manganous chloride to
increase the amount of higher chloride by another 15 per cent.

with practically no evolution of free chlorine, and that nearly
the whole of the available oxygen which the former contains
may be recovered when the action is reversed by decomposing
the solution with excess of water.

288                 Mr. S. U. Pickering           on the Hypothetical
simpler explanation is that it had dissolved during the filtra
tion and after the estimation of the evolved chlorine, especially
as no precautions whatever were taken to keep the liquid at
 –26° while being filtered, and as (according to Mr. Vernon
himself) the solubility of the dioxide increases rapidly with a
rise of temperature. Some error of unknown magnitude
must, at any rate, have been introduced in this way, and
would render the results entirely untrustworthy, yet on these
results, although opposed to his subsequent experiments,
Mr. Vernon’s sole argument against the higher chloride being
Mn2Cls depends.
   2. The greatest amount of available orygen obtained by de
composing the higher chloride by water is 50 per cent. of that
present in the dioxide taken (see equation 4).       the dioxide    If
contains any protoxide the amount recoverable will be                         in
creased, one gram molecule increasing it to 100 per cent.
(equation 5).    The sample used by me contained a little
monoxide, for the presence of which due allowance was made
(although Mr. Vernon concludes otherwise); and Mr. Vernon,
therefore, made some experiments “to see if it were not
possible to recover more than this (50) percentage when pure
dioxide was used.”     Unfortunately, however, he has forgotten
to say  anything  about the results of these experiments, and,
more   unfortunately   still, in those experiments with impure
oxides which he does quote he has forgotten to make an
allowance for the impurity (protoxide) which they contained.
Making this correction for him, his results are as follows:–
              I.                II.          III.
at      5°.   at   –9°.        at   18°.    at   13°.
 514           51.0        45-4 46-1        47.6 per cent. of the dioxide
                                                      recovered.
   The numbers scarcely warrant the conclusion that “instead
of the amount of dioxide recovered, being always slightly
below fifty per cent. it is always slightly above it.” It is
only above it in one case ; and                   iºn

the results of two rather difficult analyses, especially as Mr.
Vernon gives the results of but one analysis in the whole of
his paper, affording      therefore,  us,

dient for reconciling these results may be ingenious, but will,
I fear, scarcely commend itself to scientific men.         It is that
“at no temperature will the number of molecules of MnOl,
be much greater than half” of the maximum possible, the
other half being split up into manganous chloride and atoms
of chlorine, and that these atoms of chlorine at ordinary
temperatures unite to form molecules and are liberated as
such, whereas at low temperatures they are sufficiently accom
modating as to “come less often into the positions necessary
for them in order that they may unite together,” and hence
they remain in the liquid as free atoms I Mr. Vernon does
not see that, even if such a specious hypothesis could be
accepted, it entirely cuts the ground from under his feet.
His argument that the higher chloride is MnGl, depends on
all the chlorine liberated by the dioxide remaining combined
with the manganese.                    If
                              he invents a method for retaining
some of it in the liquid without                        its
                                           being combined with the
manganese, what proof has              any particular formula

change of curvature occurred within about 1 molecule.
   Referring to the straightness of my curve up to the
addition of one molecule of manganous chloride, Mr. Vernon
remarks that “it can be shown mathematically that the form
of the curve up to the addition of one molecule of MnOl, will
not be a straight line.” Had Mr. Vernon but favoured us
with the mathematics of this very complicated reaction, he
would have conferred a benefit on science and put                ablest                         its

Now, suppose the weapon of the ideal army to be a club, or,
as it were, a molecular cricket bat; and suppose, for con
venience, the mass of each demon with his weapon to be
several times greater than that of a molecule. Every time he
strikes      molecule he is to send it away with the same energy
              a
as it had immediately before.              Each demon is to keep as
nearly as possible to a certain station, making only such ex
cursions from it as the execution of his orders requires.               He
is to experience no forces except such as result from collisions
with molecules, and mutual forces between parts of his own
mass, including his weapon.            Thus his voluntary movements
cannot influence the       position   of his centre of gravity, other
wise than     by  producing    collision with molecules.
    The whole interface between hot and cold is to be divided
into small areas, each allotted to a single demon.               The duty
 of each demon is to guard his allotment, turning molecules
 back, or allowing them to pass through from either side,
 according to certain definite orders. First,               the orders                 let                  be

       XXX. A Detector for Spark in Hertz’s Resonator.

       electrical oscillations several methods have been devised
for showing some of the principal experiments to a number
of people simultaneously.
     t seemed to us that a very direct method of doing this
would be to make the spark of the resonator ignite an ex
plosive mixture of gases. After making many experiments
we find that a very convenient form of apparatus for effecting
this is the following:—A long strip of wood (not shown in

 explosion very rarely takes place, owing to the fact that liquid
 is carried up to the spark-gap by the rush of gas, and a
 minute drop almost always adheres to the ends of the wires
 forming the spark-gap, so that no spark, and consequently
no explosion, is produced.
    This difficulty, however, can be easily overcome by con
necting the two halves of the resonator with a battery of
three or four cells, so that as soon as a minute drop is formed
across the spark-gap it is at once dissipated by the current
which passes through              the battery connexions are made

302                Dr. L. Natanson on                  the      JDynamical
    A   system      of hard elastic spheres, which exert upon one
another purely collisional forces, has been found to be in many
respects an adequate dynamical representation of what is
called an ideal gas. The laws of ideal gas-pressure cannot,
however, be accounted for, unless the spheres, or molecules,
of which the body is supposed to consist are assumed to be
infinitely small.
    Now we know that, in order to explain the properties of
real or imperfect gases, it is not sufficient to correct the
original theory uniº this head solely, i. e. to consider the
molecules as bodies of some small but definite size.          Van der
Waals was led therefore to       investigate  the effect of attractive
or cohesive forces, which he supposed to operate between
molecules independently of impulsive forces, generated on
collision.    Accordingly in his equation two correctional quan
tities  appear,  determined respectively by both of these distinct
kinds of molecular interference. To my mind such a cumu
lation of essentially heterogeneous assumptions is utterly
unsatisfactory; and it certainly fails to connect the properties
to be explained with one dynamical fact only.           Hence,     ven             I
ture to   think, we have to take some broader view of the nature
of molecular interaction.
    On the other hand, although no serious discordance is likely
to arise as to the highly important rôle of Van der Waals's
theory in modern thermodynamical science, it must never
theless be affirmed that his equation does not apply to known
facts with due approximation, so that the kinetic conception
on which it is founded may be said to be disproved.

   But the growth of the modern idea of a magnetic circuit
suggested the possibility of achieving my purpose in a way
that would be largely independent of the peculiarities of
different brands of steel, as well as of the various physical
conditions caused by differences in tempering.
  I  therefore provided a short straight bar-magnet with a
couple of arched pole-pieces, of such length and sectional area
that there was left between them a narrow air-gap of very
small magnetic “resistance.”    A very flat coil of wire thrust
in or out of this   gap  gave electromagnetic   impulses whose
value was    fairly constant.  Experience    with these simple
instruments led me to believe that a more rigorous application
                                  ..
of the principle would give a truly permanent magnetic field.
How far this has been realized will appear from the con
siderations which     I
                      now have the honour to submit to the
Society.

   At the upper end of the guide-rod g is an arrangement for
allowing the ring to fall whenever the experimenter desires.
The upper end of g is bored out (fig. 3), and a horizontal slot
is cut in the thin wall thus made. In the inner
                                   Fº
space and connected with the milled head is a rod,
from the side of which          a tooth t passing
through the slot, whilst from the lower end
passes a spiral spring also fixed into the body
of g. The tooth t is thus kept in a definite
position, from which it can be moved aside
either by a rotation of the milled head, or by
the upward movement of the boss connected
with the ring.      On the inner edge of the boss
is a slot through which t can pass, but cut
slightly on one side of the zero position of the
tooth. When an electromagnetic impulse is
desired the coil is raised so that the boss, and
therefore the ring, rests on t. The position of
t and the height of the ring are so chosen
that when the ring is at rest on tº the coil is
altogether above the gap.         By a simple rotation of the milled
head the coil can be made to fall through the field at any
desired moment.       The electromagnetic impulse then given to
the circuit   is,    course, equal
                    of                        to

                                         it                     to
                                                        use an ordinary
 damped    reflecting-galvanometer.           The  object   being simply

                     Permanent Magnetic Field.                                            311
to test constancy, it was evident that the subsequent tests
would be very much like the first, and that by the above
method of working         I  might neglect damping, and also any
consideration of the law of the galvanometer deflexion.
    As the observations run through summer and winter they
had to be corrected for temperature variation. The coefficients
used were those now generally accepted, namely:—For the
Latimer-Clark cell 0.077 per cent. per 1*C; for the copper
wire of the galvanometer 0.38 per cent. per 19; and for the
|.
 German-silver resistances 0.044 per cent. per 1*.
    It now remains to give the results obtained. As my
           purpose is simply to show how far constancy of field
   as been obtained, it is not necessary to give many details.
 Before giving the results it will be proper to state the chief
 differences between the instruments numbered                  II., and  I.,              III.

point, and found it very small, but as the tests were made
with hastily-adjusted appliances, I have thought it better to
reserve the matter for further investigation.     The temperature
range involved in the Table is 10°C., but the figures cannot
be used for deducing the temperature-coefficient because of
the other sources of error.                    I
                                    am inclined to think that the
temperature variation of the condenser (which has not been
applied to the calculations) practically neutralizes that of the
inductor.
    In addition to the evidence of constancy afforded by the
Table, there are in my note-books several facts which point
the same way. Of these I shall mention only one.
    It is well known that magnetic decay is most pronounced
just after magnetization, especially if the magnet is subjected
to vibration.     In several early cases I tested the effect of
 vigorous blows during and immediately after magnetization,
 but the evidence of loss was generally very feeble, and in
 some cases not measurable.                        i.
                                        this connexion it may be
 worth   noting that the brass ring  which carries the coil is fairly
 heavy, and that when it falls it produces an appreciable blow.
 Each of the three instruments has been subject to this shock
 hundreds of times, but has shown no sign of decay under                                    it.
     Perhaps  I may      permitted
                           be            say that   to not advance          do

    ON    THE REFRACTION OF SOUND, AND ITS VELOCITY IN POROUs
          SUBSTANCES PERMEABLE                           TO SOUND.         BY N. HESEHUS.
      author gives the name of bodies permeable to sound to
 THEporous bodies such as wadding, eiderdown, sponge-shavings,
  &c., which are reputed to be bad conductors of sound, which they
 transmit more or less freely by their pores filled with air.          Expe
 riments on the     propagation  of sound in this class of bodies    present
 great interest in consequence of the analogy with the propagation
 of light in transparent media, and of electrical vibrations in
 dielectrics.
    As the velocity of sound in the interstices of a porous body is
 less than in air, it is to be expected that by means of these bodies
 we could bring about the refraction of sound.               A hemisphere,
 25 centim. in    diameter,  of metal gauze   filled with ebonite shavings,
 and closed    by  a plane  sheet of the same gauze, behaved like a
 plano-convex lens in reference to the sounds of a Galton's whistle.
The experiment may even be repeated in a lecture provided we use
a Gore's sensitive flame to observe the strengthening and enfeeble
ment of the sound. The well-known formula of lenses enables us
to calculate the refractive index of, and therefore the velocity of
sound         in,

   318                          Dr. T. Ewan on the Absorption-Spectra of
      Lippich”, in 1876, observed that the absorption-spectrum
   of didymium nitrate is different in strong      and in dilute
  solutions. This was subsequently confirmed by H. Becquerelf.
      In 1878 Glan f made a careful series of measurements on
  aqueous solutions of several salts in different
                                                  concentrations.
     e found differences between the absorptions of strong and
  dilute solutions of about the magnitude of the experimental
 error.
          Settegast $,                  in 1879, found a small decrease in the absorption
 of solutions of potassium chromate and potassium bichromate,
 with increasing dilution. This was in agreement with the

320         Dr. T. Ewan on   the   Absorption-Spectra   of
and chromic acid have very nearly the same absorption
spectrum, while that of potassium chromate is quite different:
   Erhardt 4 found that the violet solutions of potassium and
ammonium chrome-alums         and of chromium sulphate have
identical absorption-spectra,   while that of chromic chloride
is only very slightly different. The spectra of the other
salts examined were considerably different.
   As may be seen from the foregoing historical summary
the experimental       material is hardly sufficient to decide
whether the    absorptions   of acid and base in aqueous solution
are  really independent    or not.  In strong solutions, speaking
generally, they are not; but on dilution changes, greater or
smaller, occur, and it is natural to inquire whether there is a
limiting dilution beyond which no further change in the
absorption occurs, and secondly, supposing that the limit
 ºnly
exists, whether the acid and base will exercise their absorptions
                of each other in solutions more dilute than the
  imit.
   To obtain answers to these questions, it was necessary to
make photometric measurements of the fraction of the:light
of each wave-length absorbed by a molecule of different salts
of the same metal in solutions of different concentrations.
The salts of copper were used, as they seemed to form a
suitable material for the measurements.
   A preliminary set of measurements was made by a method
not unlike that used by Knoblauch f, but        Ibelieve slightly
more accurate, owing to the fact that it allows the spectra of
the two solutions which are being compared to be seen simul
taneously, side by side, in the spectroscope. A short description
of it may therefore not be out of place.
   The spectroscope used was a one-prism graduated arc
instrument, by Hilger.       The prism had a dispersion from
A to H of about 6° 20'. The solutions were contained in
.#
troughs in such a way that a long layer of a dilute solution
       be compared with a short layer of a correspondingly
strong one. The lengths of the layers and the concentrations
of the solutions were always taken inversely proportional
to each other; so that the light in both cases passed through
the same amount of copper salt.       In order that it should also
pass through the same amount of water in each case, a long
tube full of water was placed in front of the short tube con

 tion.   A B and DE were each 888 millim. long, and B C and
 FG each 102 millim. The light coming from a large Argand
 burner was rendered approximately parallel by means of
 a lens.     The two bundles of light, after traversing the
 solutions, pass through the glass cube H, by which means
 the two spectra are seen, the one above the other, and only
 separated by a narrow black band due to the edge of the
 cube, which was not quite sharp. The experiments were
 carried out as follows:—The tubes BC and FG were filled
 with a strong solution                   of,
                              say, copper sulphate, and the tubes

   The concentration appears to have no influence on the
spectra of copper sulphate and nitrate. This agrees with the
results of Knoblauch; but, as will be seen later, this is not
quite accurate, the concentration really exerting a small
influence on the spectra.
   Comparisons of the absorptions of CuCl2 and Cu(NOs), in
tolerably dilute solutions showed that no appreciable difference
exists between them. The numbers obtained are given in
Table    III. (p. 324).
   This method of merely comparing the limits of the spectra
of two solutions does not appear to be sufficiently accurate.
It is quite possible that general absorptions may exist, in
a spectrum which, not being sufficiently large to altogether
extinguish the light at any place, may pass unnoticed.               For
example, the photometric measurements made on a strong
solution of copper nitrate showed that it exerts a small general
absorption over the violet part of the spectrum. This entirely
escaped detection              method described.

326         Dr. T. Ewan        on the   Absorption-Spectra of
of layer was chosen so that the absorptions to be measured
should as often as possible fall between these limits. Three
cells were used—viz. a Schulz cell, the glass cube of which
had a thickness of 1:006 centim., and two troughs, 7-64 and
22.86 centim. long respectively. When using these troughs
the liquid only filled the lower half, the meniscus being placed
at the level of the division between the two halves of the
double slit. As, however, this produces a black band, about
2 millim. broad, between the two spectra, thereby greatly
increasing the difficulty of comparing their brightness, a flint
glass rhomb was placed between the trough and the slit, in
the same way as in Hüfner's spectro-photometer*.             The
arrangement is shown in fig. 2.

   The ends of the trough were provided with screens of
blackened card of sufficient width to prevent reflexions from
the sides of the trough or from the meniscus.         The source of
light was, as before, the Argand burner. The measurements
were made in a dark room, and extraneous light shut off from
the apparatus as much as possible by screens, and from the
eye of the observer by a piece of black velvet which covered
the eyepiece of the observing-telescope.        The light from the
Argand burner was concentrated by means of two lenses on a
hole, about   I's   inch diameter,      in black screen, and after

litre of solution.
    The measurements are made as follows:—The cell, either
empty or filled with distilled water, is adjusted before the slit
of the spectroscope on a suitable stand, and the ratio of the
intensities of the light which has passed through the upper
and lower halves of the trough is read, in various parts of the
spectrum. This gives the correction to be applied on account
of the apparatus. The solution is now placed in the trough,
and readings made through as much of the spectrum as pos
sible. Ten or more single readings were made in each region
and the mean taken.

   The quantity (1-p) is the fraction of the incident light
which has escaped being absorbed by the dissolved substance,
and is dependent on the length of layer and concentration
of solution. In order to obtain comparable numbers, the
extinction-coefficients and absorption-ratios have been calcu
lated from the values of (1-p).     A few words on the con
nexion of these quantities with one another are perhaps not
altogether superfluous.

    The final value of (1-p) is calculated from two photo
metric measurements of the same kind; one, the correction
 for the apparatus, the other the measurement of the light
which passes through the solution. These will both be sub
ject to an error of the magnitude given in column Y. The
probable error of the final result will therefore be double this
                                                                   '.
amount. The numbers in column Z represent this final error,
calculated as percentages of (1-p).          e        error in the
violet is due to the small    intensity of the  light  used in that
part of the spectrum, and also to the fact that the eye is less
sensitive to differences in the intensity of light in the violet
than in the middle of the spectrum. At the red end of the
spectrum a special error makes itself felt. The measurements
are only theoretically accurate, when the part of the curve
representing the intensity of the light in the part of the spec
trum in which they are made may be considered as a hori
 zontal line. When the absorption-curve of the substance
under examination rises or falls rapidly this is no longer the
case, and for this reason the measurements          on the copper
salts in the red end of the  spectrum   are less accurate than in
 other parts.
    My first measurements on the absorptions by copper sul
phate showed a lack of agreement between the numbers ob
tained with the same solution when different lengths of layer
were used.     This was found to be due to the light not being
parallel, as the differences disappeared when parallel light
was used.     Something similar appears to have been observed
by other investigators.     Vierordt" found (with a lamp 15
centim. from the slit, and distilled water in the trough) the
ratio of the intensity of the light which had passed through
the empty half of the trough to that which had passed through
the water to be 0-8 ; the calculated number is 0.936.      Krüssf
found the ratio in a Schulz cell 0.905, that calculated being
0.993.     Ialso found the ratio in a Schulz cell 0-91, when the
light was not parallel.
   The cause of these differences may be found in the fact that
placing a layer of a medium with a greater refractive index
than air in the path of the light has the same effect as bring
ing the light nearer to the slit through a distance which is
given by the formula

 ight. A comparison with a set of measurements made with
pure water showed that at least a considerable part of the
difference observed is to be explained in this way.
   The following Tables contain a number of measurements
which were made with parallel light and distilled water in the
troughs. The good agreement found between the calculated
and observed numbers shows that the loss of light due to dust
in the liquids cannot have been very great.              f  is the ratio of
the intensities of the    light    after passing     through     the upper
and lower halves of the trough.

   The changes in the absorption-spectra of the solutions which
occur when the concentration is changed are very clearly
visible in the curves which represent the absorption-ratios.
These are drawn for convenience with the divisions of the
tangent-screw as abscissae (instead of wave-lengths), and the
values of the absorption-ratios as ordinates.    Curves 1 and 2
belong to the strong and dilute solutions of copper sulphate,

solutions containing about 4 and 2 equivalents in 1 litre, and

in general salts in aqueous solution behave in the same way
as these copper salts, though exceptions are known.
   It only remains to compare briefly the results thus arrived
at with existing theories of solution.
   (1) According to the theory of Arrhenius the electrolytic
dissociation in the most dilute copper solutions which were
examined is by no means complete, and therefore the absorp
tion-spectra of the three solutions should not be identical.
   The degree of dissociation is calculated from the numbers
of Kohlrausch” for copper sulphate, of     Trötscht and      H.                 J.                              J.

copper salt would lead (as it does with chromium salts) to a
separation of hydroxide.           The small amount of precipitate
which forms in solutions of       cupric   salts after standing for some
time appears to be due to impurities in the water (chiefly
ammonia and carbon dioxide).
   (3) According to the theory of Armstrong” and Traubef, the
changes in the absorption-spectra which occur on passing from
concentrated to dilute solutions are due to the larger aggre
É.      of molecules which exist in the concentrated solutions
  reaking up into smaller molecules. According to this theory,
the                of the salt, even in the most dilute solutions,
still exist as such ; and these dilute solutions might therefore
be expected to show characteristic differences, similar to those
observed in the strong solutions. This at any rate in the case of
 cupric salts is not the case in the visible part of the spectrum.
    (4) The changes of colour which the solutions of copper
chloride exhibit when                its
                                  solution       diluted have long been

   (1) The absorption-spectra of the three salts examined
                      'in.
undergo changes on diluting their solutions.
   (2) These          are of such a nature that the spectra
tend to become identical in dilute solutions.
   (3) The results of other observers show on the whole that
salts of other metals behave in a similar way.
   (4) The behaviour of the salts examined leads to the con
clusion that, in strong solutions, the acid and basic parts of
the salts are associated in producing absorption of light,
while in dilute solutions they act independently in doing                                           so.

       Doubling the amount of the halogen caused each of the
   two mixtures to assume the same chemical and molecular
   composition immediately on mixing.            It appears from a
   comparison of these results and those of Table I. with those of
   Table II., that the condition of chemical and molecular equi
   librium depends upon the proportion of free halogen to that
   of the salts. If the proportion of the halogen to the total of
   the salt was 1 eqt. to 1 eqt. as in Table                 eqts.                           I.,   or

      Similar remarks may be made respecting the results of this
   Table as about those of Table XIV.
      In each of these three tables the process of heating caused
   a gradual loss, and at a diminishing rate of electromotive
   force ; and each of the liquids appeared to finally acquire a
   fixed chemical and molecular state. The total percentage
   losses of mean amount of electromotive force with the three
       mixtureswere as follows:—with Cl4 KHO, 50'4;                                                                  with
       Br-H KHO, 38.7; and with I-H KHO, 19:30.
                                 General Remarks and Conclusions.
      1. The mixtures employed in this research may be divided
   into two classes, viz., those which spontaneously change with
   such rapidity that they at once attain on mixing a compara
   tively fixed state of chemical and molecular equilibrium, and
   those which only slowly change and attain such a state.
      2. The results of the present research and of previous ones
   show, that with mixtures of acids + salts, and of salts +
   salts, a fixed state of equilibrium was in nearly               cases                                      all
   immediately attained but with halogens salts, halogens

       Maxwell in the 12th volume of the Cambridge Philo

been the subject of some adverse criticism at the hands of Sir
W. Thomson f and of Mr. Bryan S. The question is indeed a
very difficult one ; and       do not             I
                                                to feel complete
confidence in the correctness of the view now to be put
forward.     Nevertheless, it seems desirable that at the present
stage of the discussion some reply to the above-mentioned
criticisms should be hazarded, if only in order to keep the
º
question       open.
   The argument to which most exception has been taken is
      by which Maxwell (Reprint, p. 722) seeks to prove that
the mean kinetic energy corresponding to every variable is
the same.    In the course of the expression           it,
                                                for the kinetic                      of T

component momenta,         assumption which Mr. Bryan charac
terizes as fallacious. But here     seems   be overlooked that
                                                             it                 to

 energy condition, but also through every configuration which
 can be reached without violation of the same condition.                 In
 the billiard-table    example     this means that      every   part    the                                  of

Justice Grove as applicable to two slabs of stone applied
equally well to the two slabs of camphor.         we suppose a         “If
slab of stone [camphor] lying on another, both having flat
surfaces, the disintegration produced by changes of weather,
of temperature, &c., [evaporation] would act to the greatest

edges had been removed, evaporation took place chiefly from
the top piece, which being more freely exposed diminished
                                                         sº
 far more rapidly than the lower piece, which it partially
 sheltered        protected from evaporation.       Hence there was
 a gradual decline in the loss suffered from day to day, namely,
 from 10 or 12 grains to 3 or 4. This decline was
 due to the diminution of surface exposed, rather than to the
 state of the weather outside. The temperature was noted
 when the weight was taken, both with the wet and dry bulb :
 but being in an inhabited room it did not greatly vary, and
 the external atmospheric conditions seemed to have but little
 influence. The experiment was terminated on the 9th Decem
 ber, when the two fragments of camphor were weighed
 separately. The lower piece weighed 54 grains and the
 upper 14. It will be seen from fig. 3 that the upper frag
 ment rests upon a kind of point due to the loss of matter
 from the upper side of the lower piece, and the under side of
 the upper piece around the point of contact, and this is exactly
 what takes place in the logging or logan stones by the slower
 action of weathering.       It will be seen that the conditions are
 now fulfilled to allow the upper piece to be rocked upon the
lower.
    An interesting result was obtained by inserting a square
 piece of filtering paper between another pair of the 13 inch
 camphor blocks. The two blocks were held between the
                                       .

   aper projected over the lower block only to the extent of
       the thickness of the scissor blades.            blocks, put on
a glass plate, were placed on a high shelf in an inhabited
room, and were left undisturbed for many weeks, when it
was found that the slight paper projection had been sufficient
to protect the lower block from evaporation, so as to preserve
the solid angles and edges.
    It was formerly supposed that light had a subtle but power
ful influence in promoting crystallization and producing
deposits of camphor and other volatile bodies on the most
illuminated side of the closed vessels containing them. This
idea was favoured in our text-books by such recent authorities
as Daniell, Brande, and Miller.       In the Philosophical Magazine
for November      1862, I  showed    by  a number of experiments
that these   deposits  are made,  not on the most illuminated side
of the vessel, but on the coldest side. With respect to crys
tallization it was supposed that a saline solution would not
deposit  its salt
                if    the vessel containingit    were screened from
the   light.   Thus Chaptal observed that       by    covering over

            XL.    Erperiments upon Surface-Films.
                By Lord RAYLEIGH,       Sec. R.S."
          experiments here described are rather miscellaneous
THE   in character,  but seem of sufficient interest to be worthy
of record. The     greater  number of them have been exhibited
in the course of lectures at the Royal Institution.
                The Behaviour of Clean Mercury.
   According to Marangoni's rule, water, which has the lower
surface-tension, should spread upon the surface of mercury;
whereas the universal experience of the laboratory is that
drops of water standing upon mercury retain their compact
form without the least tendency to spread. To Quincke belongs
the credit of dissipating the apparent exception.        He found
that mercury specially prepared behaves quite differently from
ordinary mercury, and that a drop of water deposited there
on spreads over the whole surface. The ordinary behaviour
is evidently the result of a film of grease, which adheres with
great obstinacy.
    The process described by Quincke is somewhat elaborate;
but my experience with water suggested that success might
not be so difficult, if only the mistake were avoided of pouring
 the liquid to be tried from an ordinary bottle.       In the early
experiments upon the camphor movements difficulty seems to
have been experienced in securing sufficiently clean water
surfaces. The explanation is probably to be found in the
desire to use distilled water, and to the fact that the liquid
would usually be simply poured from a stock bottle into the
experimental vessel.      No worse procedure could be devised;
for the free surface in the bottle is almost sure to be dirty,
and is transferred in great part to the vessel.       In my expe
rience water from the dirtiest cistern will exhibit the camphor
movements, provided that it be drawn in the usual manner
from a tap, and that the precaution be taken to give the vessel
a preliminary rinsing.
   In order to carry out the idea of drawing the liquid from
                          ..".
underneath, an arrangement was provided like an ordinary
wash-bottle, and was filled with tolerably clean mercury.       As
experimental vessels                      are convenient.     They
may be dipped into strong sulphuric acid, rinsed in distilled
water, and dried over a Bunsen flame.        When the glasses are
cool   they may  be  charged   with  mercury,    of which the first

364                        Lord Rayleigh on Experiments
portion is rejected.     Operating in this way there was no diffi
culty in obtaining surfaces upon which a drop of water would
spread, although, from causes that could not always be traced,
a certain proportion of failures was met with.
   Exposure of the glasses to the atmosphere soon tells upon
the success of the experiment, although on one occasion
spreading occurred after a glass had stood (with protection
from dust), for 20 hours. Even so short an exposure as
10 minutes was found to prejudice the condition of the
mercury surface.        Although something here may have de
pended upon the special character of the sample of mercury,
it will be advisable in repeating the experiment to pour the
mercury at the last moment.
   As might be expected, the grease which produces these
effects is largely volatile.     In many cases a very moderate
preliminary warming of the watch-glass makes              the differ                  all

  Even in the interior parts of the surface at a distance from
the edge   the sulphur particles do not retain their initial
positions, but form aggregations into which continually
increasing numbers are attracted. This is also due to gravity,
neighbours tending, as it were, to fall into the depression by
which every particle is surrounded.
            Camphor Movements a Test of Surface-Tension.
    The theory of these movements, due to Van der Mens
brugghe, implies that they will take place with greater or less
vigour so long as the tension of the surface, which may be in
some degree contaminated, is greater than that of a saturated

great that the tension falls below this point, the solution
camphor can            longer spread upon the surface, and the
                             no
movements cease. Thus, according                   this theory and       to                                             to

purity of a water surface.     In a very good light a special
dusting might probably be dispensed with, the motion of the
surface being evidenced by inevitable motes.
    If the dust be applied in the first instance to a small central
patch, which is then touched internally with a very small
quantity of oil, the expansion of the dust in the form of a ring
is followed by a slight but unmistakable rebound. The effect
appears to take place when the surface is very clean to begin
with, and is then somewhat difficult of explanation.            am                           I
disposed to think that it must be attributed in all cases to
initial contamination. This is concentrated in front of the
rapidly advancing ring, and has not time to diffuse itself
equally over the whole external area.        Under the influence
of inertia the expansion of the central area may then proceed
so far that       its
                tension becomes greater than that        the parts                     of

  with the spirit-flame had driven away most of the residual
  contamination.

      The best effects were obtained with a dish somewhat larger
  than that above mentioned ; and in subsequent experiments
 the difference of temperature between different parts was more
 readily maintained by the use of a vessel in which the main
             were connected by a comparatively narrow channel.

 compartment balancing the colder but greasier surface in the
 other. And the actual temperature difference necessary for
 equilibrium gives a measure of the small difference of tensions
 to be compensated".
     When the surface of the liquid in the tin vessel is but ver
 slightly greased, a spot can no longer be cleared by the
 of the finger held underneath. Indeed the spirit-flame itself
 soon becomes ineffective.       And yet the greasing may be so
 slight that camphor fragments move with apparently unabated
 W10 Our.
    Tt is   of interest to compare the behaviour of saturated
 solution of camphor with that of greasy water. The former
can scarcely be brought to rest, unless covered up.             This is
doubtless due to evaporation of camphor, aided by local
draughts.      A spirit-flame drives away dust in a manner im
possible in the case of a merely greasy surface, whose tension
may nevertheless be decidedly higher than that of the cam
phorated water.
     It may here be mentioned that the lowering of tension by
camphor follows a different law from the lowering caused by
soap.     In the latter case the fall of tension requires time, and
at the first moment of its formation a free surface has almost
the tension of pure water. Similar experiments to those
    * The lowering of tension per degree Cent, is said to be 0018 of the
total value.

370                  Lord Rayleigh on Experiments
formerly recorded+ with soapy water have shown that the
ratio of tensions for pure water and for solution of camphor
are the same at the first moment of the formation of a free
surface as when the measures are conducted statically.
                            Saponine and Soap.
     A  strong      infusion of horse-chestnuts allowed excellent
bubbles to be blown, up to 4 inches or more in diameter.
 When the interiors of equal bubbles of soap and of saponine
 were brought into communication, the latter contracted and
 the former expanded, showing that the tension of the sapo
 nine film was the greater. In order to obtain equilibrium,
 the diameter of the saponine bubble required to be about half
 as great again as that of the soap bubble.               These saponine
 bubbles exhibited the characteristic            wrinkling,  when caused
 suddenly to contract by withdrawal of part of the contained air.
     The foaming of Highland waterfalls is doubtless attributable
 to dissolved vegetable matter. In the autumn of 1890                I had
an excellent      opportunity    of  observing   these effects in the case
 of the river Creed at Stornoway.                By the coalescence of
 smaller ones hemispherical bubbles of remarkable size, up to
 a foot or more in diameter, were frequently formed, and en
 dured for a few seconds; and yet not the smallest bubble
 could be blown from a tobacco-pipe.              However, by collecting
 some of the foam and           allowing    it to subside, which took a
 good while,      I  obtained liquid from which bubbles could be
 blown with a pipe up to 4 inches diameter. But these bubbles
 behaved like soap, and not as had been rather expected, like
 saponine, remaining perfectly light and smooth when the
 included air was rapidly withdrawn.
                           Separation    of Motes.
     In the course     of some experiments last year, in illustration
 of Sir G. Stokes's theory of ternary mixtures, I had prepared
 an associationt of water, alcohol, and ether, in               ...    the
                  ...
   uantity of alcohol       was so adjusted that the tendency to
   ivide into two parts      was almost lost.     As it was, division took
                            º
 place after                 into two    nearly   equal parts, and these
 parts were of almost         identical composition.      On placing the

                was struck with the contrast between the appear
  ance of the two parts.         The lower, more aqueous, layer
  was  charged   with motes, while the upper, more etherial, layer
  was almost perfectly free from them.           Some years ago I had
 attempted the elimination of motes by repeated distillation of
  liquid in vacuum, conducted without actual ebullition, but                                               I
 had never witnessed as the result of this process anything so
 clear as the etherial mixture above described.
     The observation with the ternary association, which happened
 to be the first examined, is interesting, because the approxi
 mate equality of the liquids suggests that the explanation has
 nothing directly to do with gravitation.            But the presence of
 alcohol is not necessary.         Ether and water alone shaken
 together exhibit the same phenomenon. It would appear that
 when the two liquids are mixed together in a finely divided
 condition, the motes attach themselves by preference to the
 more aqueous one, and thus when separation into two distinct
 layers follows, the motes are                      all

    The suspension of water in an inverted
tube of small bore is familiar to all. The            Fig. 2.
limit of diameter was    investigated  some years
ago by Duprez". A glass tube, such as that
shown in fig. 2, is ground true at the lower
end, and at the upper end is connected to an
india-rubber tube provided with a pinch-cock.
Water is sucked up from a vessel of moderate
size, the rubber is nipped, and by a quick
motion the tube and the vessel are separated,
}.referably by a downward movement of the
          % this way of working Duprez found
that the liquid might remain suspended in
 tubes of diameter up to 16 millim., and with
the aid of a sliding plate up to 19.85 millim.
 The theory is given in Maxwell’s article in
 the Encyclopædia Britannica (“On Capilla
 Action ”). For lecture purposes it is well
not to attempt too much. The tube employed
 by me had an internal diameter of 14% millim.,
 and there was no difficulty in obtaining sus
 pension. The experiment on the effect of
 ether-vapour was then as follows:—The inverted tube, with
 its suspended water, being held             clamp,   beaker con

WAllous
   propagation       of  magnetism   along bars of iron or around
rings of this metalf. The ordinary method of investigation
has been to subject the iron to alternating currents of a certain
frequency, and to search for nodes along the extent of the bar
or ring.    The search has been conducted by employing small
secondary coils of wire connected with a ballistic galvanometer
or with telephones.
     Ihave lately examined this question with a new instrument
which          I
          have termed a phasemeter, and which seems to me to
be of   great  use in the subject of alternating currents.        It
consists of an application of Lissajous’s method of studying the
vibration of tuning-forks to two telephones which take the
place of the tuning-forks.      On the diaphragm of each tele
phone is affixed a mirror; and the axes of the telephones are
so turned that the excursions of a spot of light, reflected from
both the mirrors of the telephones, represent the figure pro
duced by a combination of two motions at right angles to
each other.     In the telephone which        have employed, the  I
diaphragms are about three inches in diameter, and are
clamped delicately around the edges upon their support by
little screw-clamps, which can be moved about until the dia
phragm vibrates in unison with the alternating currents which
are employed.       Professor Eli W. Blake f has described a
method of     making   the vibrations of a telephone-diaphragm
visible.    And since                     I
                            began to work upon this subject
M. Wien S has described an instrument which he terms an
optical telephone, which he employs for the measurement of
alternating currents. In his method a stylus connected with
the centre of the diaphragm touches a light mirror which is
placed upon a flexible support, and thus the motions of the
diaphragm are amplified. Great care must evidently be taken
that the support of the mirror should move in unison with the
stylus connected with the diaphragm.            Professor Blake’s
method is an extremely sensitive one : for my purposes, how
ever,      I
         have found the method of clamping the diaphragm
around      edges  itssuitable points sufficiently sensitive, and
                                at                                               I

 of either of the coils, the following phenomena, which are
sufficiently obvious, were observed.             With a current of 2500
 alternations  per  minute,    an  ellipse was seen in the phasemeter
 when the coils were at an          equal   distance from the ends of
either of the large coils. When poles of the same name were
opposed to each other, this ellipse changed from an ellipse
with   its major axis inclined           the right             ellipse with
                                                                  to       an

    At the central point       on the iron between the two poles                              of

                                     and consequently the telephone
connected with this coil gave            amplitude, and

XLII.       Note on the Selective Absorption of Light by Optical
     Glass and Calc-spar.             By EDWARD L. NICHOLs and
    BENJAMIN W. S.Now *.
                                          experiments  t,
IN had   the course of some recent                         the authors
              occasion to measure the absorption which the rays
from an incandescent lamp suffered in passing through a lens
and a pair of Nicol's prisms. A number of observations
upon the absorption of light by lenses have already been
published, but they deal for the most part with the total
absorption. Vierordti, however, and very recently Kruess S,
have measured the amount of absorption that takes place in
each region of the visible spectrum, and Abney and Festing ||
have shown that such absorption may introduce very im.
portant errors into colour photometry.
     For the details of the method by means of which the
 selective absorption in glass and calcite was determined, we
 must refer the reader to the article already cited. The lens
and prism in question were mounted before the slit of a
 spectrophotometer under conditions which made it possible
 to compare the light from a glow lamp with rays from the
 same lamp after passage through the lens, or through both
 lens and prisms.        In every other respect the two sets of rays
 under comparison were subjected to precisely the same
 treatment, in their path from the lamp to the eye of the
 observer. Any differences in the character of their spectra
 were ascribable, therefore, to losses incurred in traversing
 the lens, on the one hand, or to the combined action of the
 glass and the calcite on the other. No attempt was made to
 distinguish between losses due to absorption and those
  resulting from reflexion at the various surfaces.
      In presenting our results, light of the region of the D line
  (A=5890) is taken as a standard of reference.            The amount
  of light of this wave-length, transmitted by the lens, or by
  the Nicol's prisms, respectively, is taken as unity, and the
  relative proportions of light of other wave-lengths trans
  mitted are given in terms of that quantity.             This method
  expresses the character of the change.               The results are

   The lens referred to in Table I. is made of ordinary white
crown glass (refractive index 1:549).            It consists of two
simple plano-convex lenses, the added mean thickness of the
two being about 2 cm.
   The Nicol's prisms were of the usual form, their thickness,
measured in the direction of the path of the ray, being about
50 mm.
   It will be seen that the glass of which the lens was
constructed although not more strongly coloured than most
optical glass, the tint being quite unnoticeable to the unaided
eye, at least when seen through in the direction of the optical
axis, is far from being colourless. The selective absorption
begins to show itself in the red and the transparency falls off

steadily throughout the spectrum, the transparency for the
region beyond the G line being only three fourths as great - as
that for red light.
   In the case of the Nicol's prisms, however, the transparency
throughout the red and yellow is quite uniform, diminishing
less than one per cent. between the A line and the D line.
   In the blue and violet, on the other hand, absorption
appears to be relatively more marked in calcite than in glass.

     ARISTIDES         BREZINA, Director of          the Mineralogical
DR. Department of       the Museum, gives a short Preface, noticing
the history of this special collection, giving due credit to those who
have helped in the work, and especially acknowledging the industry
and acumen of F. KARRER in perfecting this extensive and useful
Collection.   An Introduction gives (1st) a general account of the
collection and of the method followed in its arrangement and in the
Guide-book: (2nd) brief notices of the characteristics of the most
common and useful rock-materials: (3rd) the geological order of
the rocks and strata: (4th) a Bibliography of memoirs and books
on constructive materials, in chronological order from 1831.
   In the body of the work the main arrangement is geographical;
and a city or town in each division, in many cases supplying one
or more chief buildings (of which there are forty “phototypes”),
has a detailed account of the nature and sources of the various
building-materials used in these constructions;         and      paving

  This work is an excellent model for what might be done with
advantage by geologists and architects in other countries: indeed
Dr. Karrer intimates that England in particular could produce, and
decidedly requires, such a Guide-book, having reference to the
local museums, quarries, and great buildings, whether public or
private works.
   The exquisitely neat and truthful reproductions of the many
architectural photographs used in illustrating this Guide-book
greatly enhance its value both for the general reader and the con
noisseur of stone-work.      A long list of corrections is supplied;
and a very full and useful Index of things, places, and names
occupies the last fifty pages.

 December 9,    1891.-Sir Archibald Geikie, D.Sc., LL.D., F.R.S.,
                         President, in the Chair.
THE 1.following     communications were read:—
            “On the Rocks mapped as Cambrian             in Caernarvon
shire.”    By the Rev. J.  F. Blake, M.A., F.G.S.
   In this paper the following is given as a definite succession in the
Cambrian series:—1. Pale Slates; 2. Upper Purple Slates; 3. St.
Ann's Grit; 4. Lower Purple Slates; 5. Rhiw-wn Grit; 6. Hard
banded     Pale Slates and Hälleflintas; 7. Bangor Conglomerate;
8. Hard banded Pale Slates and Hälleflintas; 9. Bangor Breccia;
10. Blue banded laminated Grits; 11. Tairffynnon Conglomerate;
12. Blue banded laminated Grits; 13. Brithdir quartz-felsite Grit.
   The general succession is argued to be the same in the isolated
portion east and south of Bangor as in the main mass. The existence
or otherwise of a base on the mainland is considered to depend on
the age assigned to the Dinorwic felsite, and the presence of the
summit-beds to depend on whether the Bronllwyd Grit (stated to
belong to the overlying group) rests conformably or unconformably
on the Cambrian rocks.
   It is argued that the rocks to the west of the Llyn Padarn felsite
belong to the lower part of the series and those to the east to the
upper, and that the felsite is a volcanic complex belonging to the
middle of the Cambrian period.
   A post-Cambrian age is assigned to the conglomerates of Moel
Tryfan and Llyn Padarn, thus causing the break at the base of the
Silurian system to assume an increased importance.
   2.  “The Subterranean Denudation of      the Glacial Drift, a probable
cause   of  submerged   Peat and Forest-beds.”      By W. Shone, Esq.,
F.G.S.
   A description is given of a section at Upton, Chester, where
Boulder Clay rests upon “mid-glacial sands.”          The Boulder Clay
sinks to a lower level in the small valleys which are cut through
into the sands; and the author supposes that this is due to the
subterranean denudation of the sands, which would be greatest near
the valleys, and become less at a distance from them.            He con
siders such denudation is capable of producing submerged peat and
forest-beds, and accounts for the splitting of peat-beds, as described
by Mr. G. H. Morton, by a somewhat similar action, which he
believes may have also operated in Carboniferous times, causing the
splitting of coal-seams.

   Oswestry.”      By A. C. Nicholson, Esq.         Communicated by W.
   Shone, Esq., F.G.S.
      These gravels are found at Gloppa, and are situated at a height
   of from 900 to 1160 feet above sea-level, on the eastern slope of a
   ridge of Millstone Grit which forms the western border of the
  Cheshire and Shropshire plain.
      The beds present the appearance of having been abruptly cut off
  on the north-eastern slope. The gravels are in places much contorted,
  and false-bedding is frequent. They contain numerous striated
  erratics. Amongst the boulders are Silurian grits and argillites,
  granites like those of Eskdale, Criffel, &c., Carboniferous rocks, Lias
  shale, and Chalk flints.     The shells are often broken, rolled, and
  striated, but the bulk of them are in fairly good condition.
      A list of the shells is given, including nine Arctic and Scandina
  vian forms not now living in British Seas, nine northern types, also
  found in British seas, two southern types, and nearly fifty species
  of ordinary British forms. Comparative lists of the shells of Moel
  Tryfan and of those now living in Liverpool Bay are placed side by
  side with the list of shells from Gloppa.
          December 23.—W. H. Hudleston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
                       Vice-President, in the Chair.
     The following communications were read:—
     1. “On Part of the Pelvis of Polacanthus.”         By R. Lydekker,
 Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     2. “On the Gravels on the South of the Thames from Guildford
 to Newbury.”       By Horace W. Monckton, Esq., F.G.S.
     The author stated that the greater part of the hill-gravel in the
 district referred to belonged to the Southern Drift of Prof. Prestwich,
 and that the valley-gravels for the most part consisted of material
 derived from the Southern Drift. Small patches of Westleton Shingle
 and Glacial Gravel occurred near Reading and Twyford.
     He divided the Southern Drift into three classes:–
     1. Upper Hale type, characterized by the abundance of small
 quartz pebbles and the scarcity of chert.
     2. Chobham Ridges type, with abundance both of small quartz
pebbles and chert.
    3. Silchester type; quartz scarce, and chert very rare or alto
gether absent.
    He described the localities at which these types occurred and their
limits of distribution, and then referred to the Glacial Gravels of the
Tilehurst plateau, which he believed to have been deposited before
the excavation of the valley of the Thames between Reading and
Goring.
    The author then dealt with the valley-gravels, which he believed
to be mainly derived from the hill-gravels of the immediate neigh
bourhood, and showed how the various types of hill-gravel had

386                        Geological Society.
contributed materials for the valley-gravels.       He explained that,
 with the possible exception of the Westleton Shingle, he entirely
rejected the theory of marine action in connexion with the formation
 of these gravels, and thought that the Glacial Gravels were probably
for the most part due to floods during melting of large quantities of
ice.   The remaining gravels, he believed, had been spread out by
water in valleys; as denudation proceeded, the gravel, by pro
tecting the ground upon which it lay, came to stand out as the
capping of the plateaux and hills; as the gravel itself was
denuded, the materials were carried to lower levels, forming new
gravels; and this process has been repeated up to the present
time. He explained that Prof. Rupert Jones and Dr. Irving had
already adopted this theory in part, but that he differed from them
in the entire exclusion of marine action.
   3. “The Bagshot Beds of Bagshot Heath.”             By Horace    W.
Monckton, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author stated that certain changes in the classification of the
Bagshot Beds had recently been proposed, and he gave reasons for
preferring that at present in use, which was originally proposed by
Prof. Prestwich in 1847, viz. a threefold division into Upper, Middle,
and Lower Bagshot.
    He then argued against the theory that the Upper and Middle
Bagshot Beds overlap the Lower Bagshot on the north-western side
of the Bagshot district, as had been suggested by Dr. A. Irving;
and, dealing with the various localities where Upper Bagshot had
been alleged to exist resting on Lower Bagshot or on London Clay,
he contended that in every case the evidence in favour of Upper
Bagshot age broke down on examination.
      January   6,  1892.-W. H. Hudleston, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
                      Wice-President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
    1. “On a new Form of Agelacrinites (Lepidodiscus Milleri, n. sp.)
from the Lower Carboniferous Limestone of Cumberland.”           By G.
Sharman, Esq., and E. T. Newton, Esq., F.G.S.
   2. “The Geology of Barbados.-Part II. The Oceanic Deposits.”
By A. J. Jukes-Browne, Esq., B.A., F.G.S., and Prof. J. B. Harrison,
M.A., F.G.S.
   The Oceanic     deposits rest unconformably on the Scotland Series,
with which    they contrast strongly in every respect.  They are divi
sible into five portions:—
    1. Grey and buff calcareous marls (Foraminiferal).
    2. Fine-grained red and yellow argillaceous earths.
    3. Pulverulent chalky earths (Foraminiferal).
    4. Siliceous earths (Radiolarian).
   5. Calcareo-siliceous and chalky earths (Foraminiferal).
   The whole series is more calcareous in the northern than in the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous     Articles.           387
southern part of the island, and layers of volcanic dust occur in it
at various horizons.         There is everywhere a passage from the more
siliceous to the more calcareous earths.
    From the palaeontological and lithological evidence the authors
conclude that the depth of water in which the Oceanic beds were
deposited varied between          1000 and 2500 fathoms.       The micro
scopical and chemical evidence shows that the Radiolarian earths are
similar to modern Radiolarian ooze; that the calcareo-siliceous earths
are similar to what is called by Prof. Haeckel “mixed Radiolarian
ooze”; that some of the Foraminiferal earths are comparable
to Globigerina-ooze from 1000 fathoms, and that others greatly
resemble European Chalk; and, finally, that the coloured clays
bear a strong resemblance to the so-called “red clays " of modern
oceanic areas.       Hence the raised Oceanic deposits of Barbados seem
to present us with an epitome of the various kinds of deposits
which are found on the floors of warm seas at the present day.
Equivalent deposits are known in Trinidad and Jamaica; and
it is inferred by the authors that the whole Central American and
 Caribbean region was deeply submerged during the Pliocene period,
leaving free communication at that time between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans.
    An Appendix by Mr. W. Hill treats of the minute structure of
 the Oceanic earths and limestones and of the Foraminiferal muds
 and detrital earths; and this is supplemented by a Report from
 Miss Raisin on the inorganic material of certain Barbados rocks.

 I.            interesting phenomena which accompany electrical dis
      THEcharge      through rarefied gases, although still for the most
 part unexplained, have of late been repeatedly investigated both in
 the optical and in the electrical direction. The quantitative relation
 between the optical and the electrical phenomena has, however, been
 but little studied.      Now it is only by a more perfect knowledge of
 this  relationship    that we may hope to understand and explain the
 origin and the nature of the radiation which we observe in Geissler's
  tubes, as also the part which electricity plays in those remarkable
  phenomena.                        -

   To ascertain if and how far the character of the radiation changes
                                             I
with the different conditions of the gas, measured on the one hand
the total radiation, and on the other the radiation transmitted
by a plate of alum of 3.95 mm. in thickness.                  The radiation
determined by direct observations consists of two parts—the
radiation of the gas, and that of the more or less heated sides of
the tube. The latter part must be eliminated, which is effected by
a series of observations of the radiation of the tube after the
current has been opened. From the curve of radiation thus found
it is easy to calculate the radiation of the tube during the experi
ment, and by subtracting this quantity from the quantity observed
during the passage of the current the radiation of the gas is
obtained.    This value, however, is increased by the reflexion of
the sides of the discharge-tube, and diminished on the other hand
by the reflexion of the plate of rock-salt which closes the tube.
Direct experiments, the details of which        I  suppress, have enabled
me to make a satisfactory correction for this reflexion, and therefore
to determine the total radiation in absolute measure.
   As source of electricity I principally used an accumulator of 800
elements of Planté's pattern, and also a Ruhmkorff's coil of medium
size.    The current was determined by a dead-beat reflecting
galvanometer, with a wire insulated by caoutchouc.                    The dif
erence of   potential  between two      points    in the  positive  light  was
measured by means of two thin platinum wires, soldered in the
discharge-tube, and connected with a Mascart's quadrant-electro
meter.     For exhausting the tube     I  used, in my later experiments,
a  pump   on  Sprengel's  principle, modified by Prytz (Wiedemann's
Annalen), and further improved by myself.
   I   have spared no pains to make the gases as pure as possible.
Thus neither stopcocks, nor caoutchouc tubes, nor grease were
used either in the preparation of the gas or in the connexion of
the tube with the air-pump.       To introduce the gases into the dis
charge-tube, to dry them, and to prevent the access of mercurial
vapour to the tube,    I  used the method of M. Cornu (Journal de
Physique), slightly modified for my purpose.                 My researches
extended to   oxygen   and  hydrogen   liberated    by  electrolysis   of pure
water acidulated     by  phosphoric   acid;    to   nitrogen    produced    by
leading pure air freed from carbonic acid over heated copper (first
reduced by hydrogen); and to carbonic acid produced by heating
sulphuric and oxalic acids and purified by passing through a solution
of potash.
   III. I  give here the most important results of this research.
    1. For a given pressure, the radiation of positive light is pro
portional to the intensity of the principal current. It is true that on
using very powerful currents small divergences are observed, but
in this case they are always accompanied by a permanent alteration
 of the gas, so that the same radiation is not met with again for
less strong currents.
    2. If the electric current is kept constant and the pressure is
varied, it appears that the intensity of total radiation scarcely varies

between        limits 0-1 to 1.5 mm., but it increases a little at higher
               the
pressures.    At pressures exceeding 1.5 mm. the character of the
discharge seems to be modified, after which the radiation increases
considerably with the pressure after having passed, at any rate in
certain cases, through a minimum.
    3. For the same gas under the same pressure the composition of                                                   the
radiation       constant, and does not depend

number of these molecules is proportional to the intensity of the
current, and varies but little with the variations of pressure as long
as the discharge retains its character (III. 1 and 2).   This radiation
is of an irregular character according to M. R. von Helmholtz (Die
Licht und Wärmestrahlung verbrennender Gase, Berlin 1890); or it
belongs to the class of phenomena to which M. E. Wiedemann
(Wied. Ann. xxxvii. p. 177, 1889) has given the name of phenomena
of luminescence in this sense, that the composition of the radiation
does not correspond with the temperature of the gas. The radia
tion may be of extreme intensity in the groups of short wave
lengths.
   When the pressure increases and with it the number of inactive
molecules, the irregular radiation of the active molecules may more
easily be transmitted to the former.        The number of radiating
molecules increases  therefore, and consequently   also the radiation of
the gas, but it changes in character in this sense, that the radiation
of the groups of shorter wave-lengths relatively                                    diminishes.—

It is clear from this that for all bodies in which 3-1 and r > 10 m.,
the deviations from Newton's law must lie below the errors of
observation of the most accurate measurements.
   The smaller r is chosen, the more prominent does the repulsive
force of the sun become.       If we pass over to comets' tails, which
are known to consist    principally   of gaseous hydrocarbons *, they
represent for us the individual molecules in which, according to
Exner +, 3- 10 and r < 10-9 cm. Our formula (5) cannot be in
strictness applied to this case, since the individual molecules are not
absolutely black bodies, and their radii are very small compared with
the wave-length of the incident radiation; formula (5), however,
allows us to suppose that in this case the repulsive force may be
several times greater than the attractive, that this may be of
different magnitudes for different vapours, and decreases in inverse
proportion to the square of the distance from the sun. Bredichin                                f
has calculated from the curvatures of the tails of forty comets, by
Bessel's method, the repulsive force which the sun exerts, on
various substances forming the tails, and has found three values
17:5, 1:1, and 0.2; these values can without straining be referred
to the mechanical action of the radiation, without, like Zöllner §,
having recourse to the assumption of an electrostatic charge on the
Sun.
  It may be observed that Faye || has already expressed the opinion
that the repulsive force of the sun is to be sought in    radiation.         its

occupied almost the whole breadth                 the trough, was 4.5 centim.

ings were small triangular ebonite plates which were fastened to
the side of the glass vessel.    The cylinder turned slowly and con
tinuously with currents of 0-1 to 1 ampere. The motion gradually
became slower, in the first place probably because the surface of
the cylinder became rough, owing to electrolysis.        After going for
some time the motion appeared to become more uniform.                Some
experiments gave an approximate proportionality             between the
velocity of rotation and the strength of the current.       It is possible

 ON A METHOD OF DETERMINING           ELECTRO MAGNETIC RADIATION.

    The method applied by the author consists in bringing a thermo
element near a fine platinum wire heated by the electric vibrations,
and measuring the increase of temperature of the junction.           As a
comparison the platinum wire is also heated by a constant current,
and the rise of temperature of the junction is also measured.         Two
 series of experiments were made.       In one the author employed a
 form of secondary inductor which has frequently been used (two
 thin brass plates each 30 cm. in length by 5 cm. in breadth), and
investigated the heating of a thin platinum wire 2 cm. in length.
The observations showed a production of heat of 0.000155 calorie
per second.     In the second case, a single platinum wire 26.3 cm. in
length was exposed to radiation, and the value 0-000088 calorie
 per second obtained.        In both series of experiments Hertz's
 mirror was used with a distance of 1:44 metres between the focal
lines.    It may in addition be mentioned that a wave-length of 66
 cm.  corresponds   to the primary inductors, that the Ruhmkorff was
excited   by three  accumulators,  and that the breaks were at the rate
 of 23 per second.      Boys, Briscoe, and Watson (Phil. Mag. 1891,
 xxxi. p. 44) determined the intensity of the electromagnetic radia
 tion with the aid of the convection air-thermometer, and found the
 value 0.000685 calorie per second. The length of the wire they
 used was 2 × 103 cm., and it was at a distance of 30 cm. from a
 couple of primary inductors of above 100 cm. in length.           If the
 value found by the English physicists is referred to unit length of
 the irradiated wire, and if this is done also for the second value
 found by the author, the result is a production of heat in both
 cases of 0.000033 calorie per second.       Owing to the great differ
 ence between the two methods, this agreement is of course only
accidental.—Wiener Berichte, February 18, 1892.

  XLVI.     On  the Resistances to  Transverse Strain in Beams.
               By Robert CRADock NICHOLs”.
A. COMMUNICATION
       1855  by  Mr. W. H.
                                was made to the Royal Society in
                              Barlow,  in which a new theory was
              to account for the amount of strength exhibited
  y bars or beams of cast iron subjected to transverse strain,
which could not be reconciled according to any previousl
suggested hypothesis with the results obtained from experi
ments on direct tension.
   Shortly stated, Mr. Barlow's theory was this: that in
addition to the resistances to deflexion or rupture called into
action by the compression of the fibres on the one side, and
their extension on the other side of the bar, a further amount
of resistance was developed by the lateral action of the fibres
caused by the curvature of the bar, which he termed a resist
ance to
        #.
   Mr. Barlow
elaborate
                  gave in his paper an account of a number of
           experiments    which he regarded as establishing the
truth of this theory, and further developed it in an algebraical
form in a series of equations which were made to correspond
with the experimental results.
   The theory thus proposed has since been generally accepted
and approved,      .."  has continued to the present time to be
regarded by the best practical authorities as the true expla
nation of the facts; though a doubt has been expressed

whether lateral action alone was sufficient to account for the
whole of the extra strength which had been observed *.
   The use of cast iron as a material for beams and girders
has been so much discredited, and to a great extent super
seded by that of wrought iron and steel, that the practical
importance of this question has greatly diminished since the
date of Mr. Barlow's investigations.           It may, however, be
still regarded   as one of some theoretical interest, and          true                    its

400                     Mr. R. ('. Nichols            on the Resistances
   Before proceeding to inquire further into the real cause of
the actual amount        of resistance found to exist in bars sub
jected to transverse strain, it will be desirable to examine
 somewhat closely some of the experiments detailed by Mr.
 Barlow, and the conclusions drawn from them by him for the
Pºlº,       of establishing his theory.
      is first set of experiments were made “in order to estab
lish clearly the position of the neutral axis;” and he states
 that they “point it out as the centre of the beam in a manner
 so decided as to remove                all
                                  further doubt       the subject, not      on
 only      the smaller strains but
             in                              larger ones,  which were
                                         the
                                                  of in
 carried      about three fourths
                  to                    the breaking weight”                                      +.
    Mr. Barlow's experiments were conducted with extreme
care, and his measurements made with              the accuracy which all
circumstances would       permit.     He observes that “considering
the  very    minute  quantities  which had          measured, and the
                                                                 to     be
numerous causes of disturbance            which observations of such
                                                      to
delicacy were liable, such         changes  as  temperature,    of
                                                                 want                         or
of  perfect uniformity          the dimensions

beams, the results exhibit much more regularity than could
have been expected.”
   These experiments were made upon cast-iron beams                                                    or

on each of which were cast small vertical ribs at intervals of
 12 inches: these ribs were   inch wide and projected

 --8, or .6875 inch. It would, however, be impossible to
 regulate the distance with any very minute accuracy, and
 some considerable part of the irregularities observable in the
 measurements may probably be due to this cause.
     “It  will be observed,” says Mr. Barlow, “that the exten
 sions and compressions increase in an arithmetical ratio from
 the centre to the extreme upper and lower sides of the beam.”
If   we substitute the word “neutral axis.” for “centre,” it is
 obvious that this must necessarily be the case; and any devia
 tion from this law must be regarded as resulting from errors
 of measurement, inequality in the distances between the
 points measured, want of uniformity in the material, or other
accidental causes.
     It may therefore be assumed that if an arithmetical series
 be taken, approximating as nearly as possible to             the actual                all
 measurements, the quantities          obtained may         regarded

406                 Mr. R. C. Nichols                on the Resistances
be, in comparison with their elongation or contraction, some
thing extremely small, and the resistances thereby occasioned
comparatively insignificant.
   Mr. Barlow says “there are in fact two distinct changes of
figure. There is the change produced by the tension and
compression, which if acting alone would result in the figure
efgh (a rectangle), and there is the change produced by the
curvature, which if acting alone would result in the figure
lp n or m (a similar rectangle with the upper and lower sides
curved), the combination of these effects is necessary to pro
duce the figure which a beam assumes under transverse strain”.
   But this is to take into account twice over the greater part
of the displacements by which the resistance is occasioned.                                      If
the area of the first figure represent the resistances caused by
direct strain, it is clear that the addition caused by the second
displacement cannot exceed that represented by the space not
included in both areas.
   What the experiments show us is a loss of resisting power
with the increase of deflexion, manifested, as already pointed
out, by an increasing ratio of deflexion to load, and therefore
something absolutely the reverse of a resistance to flexure.
   In addition to the conclusion already quoted as to the
position of the neutral axis, which has been shown not to be
confirmed by the experiments, Mr. Barlow makes this further   -
comment upon them :—

And    although experiments prove that rupture does not
actually take place until the tensile strain is such as would
correspond, if the elasticity continued unimpaired, to a tensile
stress of at least 60 or 70 thousand pounds, the actual stress
producing rupture, and which cannot therefore have been
exceeded, is not more than a third of that amount.              The
experiments of Hodgkinson show a tensile strength for various
samples of cast iron varying from 13,404 to 21,907              Mr.                           lb.

the centre of  gravity of the section.
   In the case of cast iron it has been found, as already stated,
that even with very moderate strains the ratio of stress to
strain varies to some extent from its initial value E. But
this variation does not become considerable for either
tensile or compressive stress until it approaches that which
ultimately produces rupture".         And no very considerable
error will result from    assuming    that the compressive stress
varies directly with the strain in any bar of rectangular section
subjected to transverse strain, and that the tensile stress also
varies directly with the strain until it reaches the amount
which ultimately produces rupture and then remains constant
until the strain likewise reaches the point of rupture.
   These assumptions will simplify the figures, the areas of
which measure the total tensile or compressive stress, and
these will then become respectively the pentagonal figure

The amount of elongation varies directly with the deflexion

But when this is the case, as indicated by an excess of actual
deflexion over the normal amount, an increase of elongation
will be occasioned in a larger ratio than the increase in the
deflexion, owing to the excess of curvature being confined to

this overstrain will extend will be as far as the point at which
the maximum tensile stress S is the same as the calculated

418           Mr. R. C. Nichols   on the Resistances
pression   of the fibres varies directly with the amount of
extension or compression.
   When this condition does not continue to the point of rup
ture, but, as in the case of cast iron, the limit of elasticity
has been passed for tensile, but not for compressive, strain
before rupture takes place, the maximum tensile stress is that
which will produce rupture by direct tensile strain.       But this
maximum stress will exist, after the limit of elasticity is
passed, not only at the lower margin, but for some distance
within the substance of the beam. The form of the areas of
equal maximum stress will be that shown in fig. 7, and the
position of the neutral axis will be raised above the centre of
gravity of the section.
   The same considerations will lead to the
conclusion that when the limit of elasticity is
passed before rupture for compressive, but not
for tensile strain, the form of these areas will
be that shown in fig. 9, and the position of
the neutral axis will be depressed.        When          Fºg 9.
it is  passed   for both tensile and     compres
sive strain, the form will be one of the two shown                in
fig. 10; and the position of the
neutral axis will be raised or

tensile stress is the                             7%. 70
   In  each case the maximum tensile stress is supposed to be
measured by the base of the section, and to be the unit of
stress for both of the areas.
   The same principles will apply to beams of any other
section. In all cases the effect will be the same as if the
dimensions of the section were reduced for some distance on
each side  of the centre of the beam, and the stress continued
to increase proportionally to the strain without limit up to the
point of rupture.                                               -
   The results of four experiments made by Mr. Barlow on the
deflexion of bars or girders of rectangular section under
various loads increased by degrees to the breaking weight are
recorded in his paper of 1855.      In the following Tables the
figures of the first and third columns are the loads and corre
sponding deflexions given by Mr. Barlow as the results of his
first two experiments, the other quantities being calculated

   centre of the bars submitted to transverse strain may have
   been equal to the greatest tensile stress supported without
   rupture in any of the bars subjected to direct strain, which
  was 21,745 lb.
      When the maximum tensile stress is first nearly approached
   the tensile stress at the lower fibres will be somewhat less than
   that given by the equation, but may be assumed to be deter
   mined by it until it is equal to a maximum somewhat below
   the breaking stress, and afterwards to remain constant at the
   same amount.      If it had continued to vary with the load its
   amount would be that given in column 5, and the actual
   maximum tensile stress may be taken to be that in column 6.
      Column 7 gives the ratio r of the two last values when the
  former exceeds the latter, and the quantities in the remaining
  columns are calculated by the equations above deduced from
  the theory of overstrain.
      The annexed diagram (fig. 11) exhibits in a more strikin
  form than the Table the relative proportion of the
  deflexions to those measured and of both to the normal de
  flexion. The lengths of deflexion in the diagram are three
  times the actual amount.

would appear from this that the maximum tensile stress might
have been taken to be somewhat less.           But it must be remem
bered that for convenience of calculation the stress has been
assumed to vary with the strain until the former has reached
 its  maximum amount, whereas               fact the overstrain com
                                                           in

deflexion must        somewhat deficient, especially for the loads
                             be
about one half the breaking weight.            Making allowance for
this  circumstance,    the calculations accord very fairly with the
facts as observed.

one “point” for diagrammatic                         purposes.             The mean error of
                                                                                           by the
                                   A/º
each of these points was determined in the usual way

in which a, B, &c. are the differences between the individual
observations and the arithmetical mean of them, and n the
number of those observations.
  To determine the relative acceptability of any drawing as a
representation of series of experiments, several considerations
must be taken into account:—
   (1) The actual magnitude of the average apparent error of
                               .
the points as compared with the drawing.
    (2) The number of points represented by it as showing an
exceptionally large          improbable error.
     (3) The grouping together of errors with like signs.
     (4) The equivalence of the sum of the minus errors to that
of the plus errors.
                    I
    As far as know, no method has been proposed for taking
proper account of any of these points except the first, still less
for combining them so as to get a single value to represent the
general acceptability of the drawing; and although the method
          I
which have adopted in the following pages might be improved
in abler mathematical hands,                     I
                                      think that it will be found to
approximate closely to a mathematically correct method, and
it is at any rate convenient, and seems to lead to results which
are fair from           all
                     points     view.of    may mention that
                                                      I              was                   it
not till after    had adopted this method under the impression
                  I
that, though fair,       was entirely arbitrary, that
                              it                             found that         I
it   could    justified
              be         mathematically.

                                         or

 errors   may       be
                   estimated              by

twice the average experimental error e, m the number of
points exhibiting this excessive error, and n the total number
of points in the drawing.                                If
                                   e, is less than unity, unity
should be substituted for it.
   Referring to this error, Mr. Hayes has recently written
to me as follows:—“I have been looking into the values
for your es error, and find reason to think them perfectly
fair, or, if they are unfair at all, it is in giving too modest
an estimate of this error.     The ideal            of e,      find             Viº                           I
to be about     4,  and  any  value for it    greater  than,  say,
2 would be highly improbable.          With a limited number
of points, the fact that e, was less than 4 (or 1) would prove
nothing.           I
               am inclined to think something involving the
                                                                                                   s',

more definite. Your numbers are        hardly  large  enough     for
big values         since they vary approximately
                       of   s,                           only.                                 as   s              I

440                 Mr. S. U. Pickering on the Recognition of
spond with the values given by a probability-curve, namely,
2, 6-7, 12, 17°1, 23:3, and 38.9, average 167; and it must
be remembered that all numbers below a certain value, de
pending on the scale used, will count as 0 in the practical
examination of results.       It was found in this way that the
average value of the coefficient of n, when the total number
of points examined was 9 to 18, was a little over 4, so that
the 5 which              I
                   have taken leaves some margin beyond the
average value.       The nature of the es error is obviously such
that it  may   lead to wrong conclusions in some cases: judging
from the results with dice,                    I
                                      should say that with the                                    co
efficient 5 we might expect es to be rather greater than unity
in 14 cases out of 50, but that in only 2 cases out of 50 would
it reach the value 2.
   4. The equivalence or otherwise of the sum of the opposite
errors need not, I think, be taken into consideration.               With
the mathematical method here adopted we ought to get an exact
equivalence ; and if in using the graphic method we make a
drawing in which there is a great want of equality, that draw
ing must be rejected, and a better one made. At the same
time I do not think that strict equality should be sought, for,
unless the number of points available is very large (some
hundreds), the equal balancing of the majority of the errors
of different signs may be upset by an accidentally large error
in one or two of them. In this respect I think that the
graphic method is superior to the mathematical one ; for
making the sum of the errors of opposite signs equal may
be a distinct source of inaccuracy.          Thus, if eighteen out of
twenty points        evenly about straight line, we ought gene

442             Mr. S. U. Pickering                   on the Recognition                of
A three-curve drawing, in which a change of curvature comes
at the same point, would of course show an error intermediate
between the errors of the two-curve and four-curve drawings;
whereas, with a three-curve drawing in which the breaks do
not come at this point, as in the case where the three curves
taken are of equal length, we get a far greater error, namely,
36 times the experimental error (column Iv.); and a drawing
of as many as even five curves of equal length (column vi.)
gives an error eight times greater than it should be.
   As far as a two-curve drawing, therefore, the figure may be
simplified either with no appreciable increase, or with an actual
diminution in the apparent error; but further simplification
is impossible, for an attempt to draw it as one curve gives a
result of which the total error is many thousand times greater
than it ought to be (column II.). The two-curve drawing
                                                                                                         is,
therefore, the simplest, and the only legitimate representation
of the experimental values.
   The next point examined was whether the two curves                                                    in
which the figure must      drawn might   be  made     meet    any    be          to                 at

                                                                                in of
                                       either side
increases the total error    from 270      20 fold
                                          to          the various

cases, and that the farther                     it   is   shifted the more            is    the error
increased.
     In   all
            the drawings here mentioned, the four forces applied
to   the ends of the lath were such that the direction of the curva
ture was the same throughout (ride supra,    141); and     was            p.                    it

produce better concordance.         therefore examined such
                                                      I

                                          of
in columns VII., XIV., xv., and XVI.; these results, though
considerably better than those given     the other curves, stillby
exhibit errors far too  great   permit    the drawings being

results were reduced so as to apply exactly to whole numbers,

must have been quite inappreciable. The reduced values are
given in the lower part of Table I.
    The results of the examination are given in Table                    III.
When represented by two equations                   at 16 per cent.
we   get,  as with the   graphic   method,  a total error which is
practically identical with the ascertained experimental error
—'95 as compared with 1:0 (column III.); whereas an attempt
to represent the points by a single equation produces a result
 with a total error 633 times greater than the experimental
error.    Columns IV. to IX. show, moreover, that any attempt
to alter the position of the change of curvature to either side
 of 16 per cent., induces a large increase in the total error,
and makes this error far too big for the drawing to be con
 sidered acceptable ; also the farther it is shifted the larger
 does the error become.       The last three columns in the table

   Mr. Hayes has suggested a method by which, when the values of r
differ by unity, the calculation of the constants may often be considerably
simplified. . If the number of points is odd, we may take the middle

444                 Mr. S. U. Pickering                    on the Recognition                of
show the results of an attempt to bridge over the change of
curvature at 16 per cent. by a single equation: any four
points could be represented with absolute exactness by an
equation such as is here used, and yet we cannot get an
equation to represent seven of the points in this part of the
figure—three on either side of 16 per cent.—without an error
twenty-one times greater than is legitimate, and even six or
five points cannot be thus represented without this error being
five times greater than it should be. This would seem to be
quite conclusive that there is a change of curvature here which
cannot be smoothed over by any simple equation of this sort.
     I
     have also examined mathematically the portion from 16
to 32 per cent. taken separately, to ascertain the result of
representing it by two curves instead of one, and find that
such a representation, and also representations in which any
six or eight of the nine points are taken, give practically the
same total error as a representation of         the nine by one           so all

cent., with a possible error of several units per cent., which
error would, however, be considerably diminished if we were
not using equations and curves of a complexity greater than
the results seem to justify.
   In the case of a feebly marked break of this sort, a single
equation will, naturally, bridge it over for a considerable
distance; but the results in columns x. and XI. show that a
single curve of the same length as those which      consider re  I
present the results cannot be applied to this part of the
figure without increasing the apparent error, and even if there
were no increase in such a case, it must be remembered that
this representation could not be accepted, for it would necessi
tate the use of three equations to represent the whole of the
figure, whereas two are sufficient, and give results in good
accord with the experimental error.
   It may be mentioned that the position of this break (14.4
per cent.) corresponds to an exact molecular proportion,
C.H.0, : 60,H,0, requiring 14.3 per cent. This is the only
break amongst those investigated in the present communi
cation in which the proportion of dissolved substance is
sufficiently large to admit of any statement as to the indica
tion of definite molecular proportions.

the subject of investigation in this case, and the experimental

examination both by the graphic and mathematical methods.
The two methods were found to agree most fully in showing that
one parabolic or bent-lath curve cannot represent the results,
but that two such curves, meeting at 2 to 2-5 molecules to
100H2O (see E F, fig. 1), would do                       so.

experimental error determined by the graphic method was
0-0021°; and a two-curve drawing, such as that shown in
fig. 2, AB, gives a mean apparent error, and also total error,
of almost exactly this amount, namely, '0020 (column x., Table

curve increases the apparent error to 5 times, and the total
error to 219 times the
   The examination     by
                                 experimental error.
                           the mathematical method shows that
two parabolas will represent the results with nearly as close
an agreement with the experimental error (1.5 times this
error") as two bent-lath curves do, but that a single para
bola is even more inapplicable than a single bent-lath curve,
the total apparent error according to it being no less than
3380 times greater than the experimental error.
    Some little doubt was entertained at first as to the exact
position of the break in this case, chiefly owing to the difficulty
of getting a lath of a flexibility, and sectional paper of a size
and accuracy, suited to the curvature of the figure and to the
experimental error, so the values were manipulated in a
variety of ways, and the results form a striking illustration of
how independent the recognition of a true break is of the
nature of the ordinates and abscissae selected for the plotting,

     Avery important additional argument in favour of the real
existence of changes of curvature has been obtained by ascer
taining that a set of results, which can be represented perfectly
by two parabolas showing a break, cannot be represented by
a single parabola, even if this has as many constants in it as
the two together had. The results with propyl alcohol in
water (case                I.)
                    were taken for this investigation, and the
calculations were simplified       little                            by

greater than the experimental error, and 24.5 times greater

464          Mr. S. U. Pickering on                  the Recognition             of
whether the modification introduced by Prof. Rücker’s fourth
term bears a sufficiently small proportion to the unmodified
part to be correctly designated as a “hump" or not; but the
illustration of converting a circle into an ellipse, which he
quotes in justification of the excrescence which he placed on
his approximate curve, appears to me to be a singularly
unfortunate one, for the ellipse is par ercellence the simplest
and most natural modification of a circle, and, as such, con
tinually presents itself in natural phenomena.      Even     this                         if
were not the case, the alteration of one constant in an equation
 (from 1 to 1—wº) is hardly comparable with the introduction
of an entirely new arbitrary function with two arbitrary
constants.
   As Prof. Rücker so strenuously defends the legitimacy of
his synthesizing his equation, I fail to see why he should
object to my analyzing it back again into                 original com    its
ponents, and thus obtaining suggestions              two           of

still less       do   appreciate his clinching argument against
                  of I                               by
the validity        these suggestions        showing that analysis                             in
another direction         possible, which, while
                          is                           fails     suggest
                                                                     it          in

one, the only one which             had thought his equation had
                                          I
really obliterated.

            I  see why because       informed Prof. Lodge,

that  I  had not then used        empirical   equations    for  detecting
discontinuities, and did not place much faith                     such           in            a
method,    I  should, now that       critic uses empirical equations
                                          a
against me, refrain from examining what evidence they afford
for   oragainst these discontinuities.          am merely meeting my

tended sufficiently far beyond the first and fourth                    the                of

                                      would have found that the one

that     I
         have put forward anything which can legitimately be
termed a “new solution” of these results—a one-break

may be more suitable for mathematical     criticism, and those
mentioned in the foregoing paper may be taken as prelimi
nary samples.    I have also investigated a large number of
instances in which the results are much less complicated than
in the case of sulphuric acid, and I have thus accumulated a
mass of evidence showing that changes similar to those
already found do occur at simple molecular proportions.    The
accumulation of such evidence, however, is a work of time,

thickness, but to the square of the thickness of the film.    In

partial.    The experimental tube was contained in a water
bath    in which was placed a thermometer, so that the action at
different temperatures might be investigated. It was noticed
that where the dried hydrogen-sulphide gas came in contact
with the filaments of cotton-wool covered with the pentoxide,
a yellow deposit, presumably sulphur, was obtained. Whether
this decomposing action is due to the finely divided oxide
superficially covering the filaments, or not, is an open question.
Moreover, it was observed that whilst the hydrogen-sulphide
       passed, the white oxide assumed a yellowish tint, which
#. isappeared entirely when subsequently the hydrogen passed
through.

     The hydrogen was first passed through the apparatus for
about one hour and a half to displace the air; the tube was
then weighed, replaced in the water-bath, and the hydrogen
sulphide passed through for about two hours, and the hydrogen
sulphide again displaced by hydrogen before a second weighing
was made. The temperature of the bath was read at intervals,
and the mean of the readings taken as the temperature of
investigation.

 15°, the weight of magnesia taken was 0-7597 gram ; after
            hydrogen sulphide, and again displacing this by
   ydrogen, the weight was found to be 0.7600 gram, or an
 increase of 0-0003 gram.       Another experiment, conducted
 under precisely similar conditions, gave the following details.
 Weight of oxide taken was 0.6360 gram, which, after the
 passage of the gas, was found to weigh 0-6368 gram, showing
 an increase of 0.0008 gram ; both of these increases are
 within the limits of errors of experiment and may safely be
 considered as such.
      In an experiment conducted at a mean temperature of 40°,
  the result was of a similar character. Thus, having taken
  0.8315 gram of the oxide, the increase in weight of this was
  0.0011 gram.      Hence it may be concluded that, under the
  conditions of these experiments, this change, which is an
  exothermic change, and therefore one which might be expected
  to take place, does not take place.
  a
      lº
      An experiment was made in which a drop of water from
               was dropped on to the magnesia, and the tube
  weighed. On passing the hydrogen sulphide through this
  mixture a rapid change is evident, the white oxide becoming
  of a greenish-yellow colour.
      The temperature of the bath during this experiment was
  15°.    The weight of the oxide and water in the tube before

the experiment was 0.7235 gram ; and after the gas had
passed was 0-8435 gram, or an increase of 0-1200 gram.
   Thus it is seen that the ratio of the increase when water is
present with the magnesia is to the increase in weight in the
absence of water as
                #.        :

    difference of weight as an indication of chemical change, the
    differences of colour produced by the formation of the sulphides
    of various metals, by the action of hydrogen sulphide on com
    pounds of these metals, were taken. The method of experiment
    was as follows:–A short strip of ordinary filter-paper was
    taken and moistened with lead acetate, then dried in a water
    bath and placed in a straight glass tube, which took the place
    of the experimental U-tube in the previously described experi
    ments, and accordingly was connected up with the drying
    apparatus.     Through this hydrogen was passed as before,
    then the    hydrogen-sulphide   gas for about two hours.        The
    paper remained perfectly white and unaltered in the dry gas.
         f, however, the paper was purposely only partially dried,
    or if a little liquid water was placed in contact with the dried
      aper, then the H2S gas instantly turned the paper black *.
      f two tubes, one containing the dried-lead-paper and the
    other a partially dried lead-paper, be placed side by side, and
    if the dried gas be passed first through the one tube and then
    through the other, the difference between the action of the
    gas on the paper in the two is very striking—the dried one
    remaining quite white throughout, whilst the other is instantly
    blackened by the gas.
       A similar comparative experiment was performed in the
    case of paper moistened with a solution of arsenic tri-chloride :
    the dried paper remained quite unaltered, whilst the other was
    instantly turned yellow.    With salts of tin, cadmium, bismuth,
    antimony, silver, copper, mercury, and cobalt, similar experi
    ments were conducted, the results being in                        all

                              of     cadmium,  and tin the differences
    are very striking.                  all

480             Mr. A. MeAulay on Quaternions as a
    I believe  that Physics would advance with both more rapid
and surer strides were quaternions introduced to serious study
to the almost complete exclusion of Cartesian Geometry, except
in an insignificant way, as a particular case of the former.
All the geometrical processes occurring in physical theories
and general physical problems are much simpler and more
graceful in their quaternion than in their Cartesian garb.        To
illustrate the meaning here to be attached to “theory” and
“general problem,” take the case of elasticity. What is
known.
St. Venant’s torsion      º:
meant by the general theory of elasticity is well enough
             What I mean by a general problem is illustrated by
                                     for any cylinder.    The same
problem for a cylinder of particular form would be called a
particular problem. For such particular problems we require
of course the theories specially constructed for the solution of
particular problems, such as Fourier's theories, complex vari
ables, spherical and ellipsoidal harmonics, &c.         It will thus
 be seen that    I do not propose to banish these theories, but
 merely Cartesian Geometry.
    To establish these views it would be necessary to make
 good the following two statements:—
     (1) Quaternions are already in such a state of development
 as to justify the practically complete banishment of Cartesian
 Geometry from physical questions of a general nature.
     (2) Quaternions will in Physics produce many new results
 that
       ma
 at all.
               be obtained by the rival and older geometrical method
     To establish completely the first of these statements, it would
 be necessary to go over the whole ground covered by general
 physical questions.     This would require a treatise of no small
 dimensions.
     It is the second statement that must be considered of the
 greater importance.       Unfortunately this, too, cannot be jus
 tified here.     It has already been conceded that the subject
 requires a slight development, and this of course would neces
 sitate a rather lengthy introduction.         It is only after this
 development that I believe startling physical progress will be
  made by help of quaternions.
     To bear out in part the assertions, however, a few examples
  of the application of quaternions to a variety of physical
  questions will be given.      Some of the results below are of
  interest in themselves. . They have not been chosen mainly on
  this account, however, but to illustrate as widely as is possible
  in a short paper the variety of the questions in which the
  subject may be expected to prove useful.
     The following are the examples chosen:—(1) A theorem in

                practical Instrument of Physical Research.                                                           481
potentials illustrated by applying it to a general electrical
problem. (2) Two examples in curvilinear coordinates. (3) A
quaternion proof of a well-known theorem of Jacobi's of great
utility in Physics. (4) A generalization of one of the well
known integrals of fluid motion. (5) The well-known par
ticular solution of the differential equation expressing the
conditions of equilibrium of an isotropic elastic solid subject
to arbitrary bodily forces. (6) A short criticism of Prof.
Poynting's theory of the transference of energy through an
electric field.
   In the proofs below, so far as quaternion knowledge is con
cerned, an acquaintance with Tait's ‘Quaternions,’ 3rd edit.,
only will be assumed.     The following two equations from
§§ 498,499 of that treatise will be frequently required below.

operates on the symbols which have the same suffix), either

show that they are on his theory true—as, indeed, he was not

 i.e. Q is what is called the magnetic potential, A, is the part

 that the parts of H and A due to magnetism are v \SIvuds
 and                 respectively are taken directly from the third

 part of Maxwell's ‘Electricity and Magnetism.” . It remains
 to prove that the parts of H and A due to C are v. Wucas and
Wucis respectively.          Since the "part of H due to magnetism

 Hence the part of H contributed by C is villucds.                   This
proves equation (15).                                     --
    Since the part contributed to A by            I  is W VIVuds, the
part contributed by the shell is cWVUvvuds= udp.                  Hence
the part contributed by C is Wicas. This proves equation

    It remains to see how far Maxwell's theory agrees with
equations (12) to (15). Since Sy(VVA)=0, we have from
equation (9) SVH= -4TSVI. Hence from equation (7)
                           VH=47(C–SVI).

                   – wV(uc + SIVu)ds
by equation (2). This is equation (15).

  Let p       be the pressure, a the (vector) velocity, and v the
force potential at any point of a fluid. Let \dp/(density) be
put as usual = P. Let d/dt denote differentiation with regard
to time which follows the motion of matter.    The fluid may
be finite or infinite, and there may be any possible kind of
discontinuity in the motion. W, denotes a surface integral
taken over the true boundary of the fluid (including the
surface at infinity ifthe fluid is infinite).  W denotes a surface
integral taken over    this true boundary, and also over both
sides of any surface  of discontinuity, which is thus supposed
to bound the region    on both sides.     The surface to which W,
refers  may  not always   contain the same fluid particles, since
for instance fissures may form leading to new parts of the
true boundary, or such fissures may close up.             When a
fissure is in process of formation W, refers to the boundary
thus created from the instant when the portions of fluid

 from a fresh point of view, Sir William Thomson's vortex-atom
 theory and Prof. Hicks's proposed modification of it ; and
 though I have not made any serious attempt to apply it in
  this direction, I still think that it can be made of use in dis
 cussing how large groups of vortices act on other large groups.
     There would be apparent attractions or repulsions of a defi
 nite kind between vortices if the acceleration da/dt could be
 expressed as a function of the vortices.     In both the theories
 just mentioned the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and
 subject to no external forces, so that r=0. In Sir William
 Thomson's theory the fluid is unbounded, and in Prof. Hicks's
 it is infinite but bounded at certain places by what may be
                     <U+017F>º
 called bubbles. In these bubbles the pressure is zero.   We

          from a definite source of light which forms the spectrum, and

          Captain Abney finds that the positive pole of the electric arc
          is a source of light of constant quality, and uses it in his
          measurements; and he indicates the quantity of white light
          used by the ratio between                               its

500                            Mr. Walter Baily on the
called an abnormal region. The colours it represents would
be visible to eyes more or less colour-blind.       There are two
abnormal regions on the left of the figure between the com
plementary spectrum-lines and the red and violet zero-lines
respectively.
    The remaining portion of the map, viz. that lying between
zero sensation lines, is of a different nature. At any point
in this region the distances measured to the zero lines are not
all in the same direction; so that one or two out of the three
 sensations must be considered to be negative.          As no one
possesses a negative colour sensation, the colours represented
in this region are imaginary.         This may be called the
imaginary region. Though it has no physical meaning it
will be found to have its value in connexion with the
geometrical structure of the map.         As an example of this,
consider the complementary spectrum-lines.              They end
abruptly, leaving a gap opposite the green ; but they may be
continued across the gap in such a way as their general form
seems to point, and this has been done in fig. 4, by continuing
the complementary spectrum-lines until they meet in a cusp
at the point on the right marked                             –
                                        1-0. This extension lies
wholly in the imaginary and abnormal region, and may repre
 sent the missing complementary spectrum of green.
    The map affords convenient methods for calculating the
 effect of mixing colours.   Let a colour which has the sensation
 red, green, and violet in the proportion                        ri,

   The curves obtained are shown in fig. 5. Consider the
curve numbered 2. This is the locus of mixtures of the blue
whose index is 2-0, and the yellow whose index is 0.5.            The
curve passes through these two points of the spectrum, giving
the cases in which a zero quantity of one of the colours is
taken ; and every other mixture is indicated by some point
on the curve joining these two points and lying to the right
of the spectrum-line. In this figure the dotted horizontal
lines occupy the positions where the indices are zero and
infinity respectively, so that the portion of any curve which
lies outside of them must be repeated again on the left side of
the complementary spectrum-line.          In curve No. 2 two small
parts do   lieoutside the dotted lines, and, accordingly, these two
parts are repeated       the left

   To plot out the curve giving the mixtures of two spectrum
colours, take a third spectrum colour and make a colour
patch of the first two colours, and another colour patch of the
third colour and white. Keep the luminosity of the third
colour constant, and vary that of the other colours and the
white until both patches are of the same colour. Then measure
the quantity of white used and mark off a line from the
position of the third spectrum colour to the right propor
tional to the quantity of white. The end of this line gives a
point in the curve. By taking other spectrum colours as the
third colour other points may be obtained.              however,                 If,               it   is

   The spectrum of sodium, so far as it has been explored,
consists of 14 pairs of lines, and of 8 others which have not
yet been seen to be double. Professor Rydberg and Pro
fessors Kayser and Runge independently                 that all
the observed lines—with one remarkable exception—lie in
three definite series, somewhat similar to that which Dr.
Huggins had found in the Spectrum of Hydrogen; and they
have worked out empirical formulae which assign to the lines
their places in these series. The kind of formula to be tried
was suggested by Balmer's Law for the lines in hydrogen,

        rise to a line in the spectrum, which will become a
  ouble line if the partial is exposed to an apsidal shift.     It is
also shown how the relative sizes, the forms, and other infor
mation about the partials may be obtained from the observa
tions; and especially how the periodic time of each partial
may be deduced from the positions of the two constituents of
the double line to which it gives rise.       It is found to be the
periodic time which corresponds to the position midway
between the two constituents of the double line on a map of
oscillation-frequencies.

endsof the horizontal lines in the other monads should be
some curve of which the parabola is a particular case. This
may happen in different ways, but the simplest hypothesis is
that they are hyperbolas or ellipses.          It appeared therefore
to be worth      ascertaining   whether   diagrams    with hyperbolas
or  ellipses,  instead of the     parabola,  would agree with the
observed    positions   of the lines in one of the other monads.
Sodium is the monad selected ; chiefly because of the peculiar
pair of lines that present themselves in the spectrum of this
element—which Rydberg speaks of as satellites, and which
Kayser and Runge, regard as probably belonging to a fourth
series of lines, of which they are the only term that has been
found.      There seemed some ground for hoping that the
inquiry would reveal the true significance of these lines.

 its principal axes, can        drawn through any three assigned

be prepared for what we shall learn further on, viz. that this
pair of lines is due to a negative value of n.
   Before, however, we can draw the diagram for any of the
series of lines, we are confronted at the outset with a difficulty.
We have to settle what three points the curve is to pass
through.     This depends on what the number m is for the
least refrangible line.   It is 3 in the case of the hydrogen
series, but there seems no reason to conclude with Kayser
and Runge that it is 3 in other cases. A preliminary diagram
was made on millimetric paper to help in determining this
point.   Each supposition as to the value of m in the least
refrangible line furnishes a distinct set of points correspondin
to the observed values of n for the terms of the series.        It
was easy to draw curves through the several sets plotted
down in this way, and that set was preferred which most
nearly agrees with the supposition that an ellipse or hyperbola
takes the place of the parabola of the hydrogen series; or
rather (since it was a
diagram of the derived                      Fig. 3.
curves that was em
ployed) that a parabola
with its axis vertical
takes the place of the
straight   line of the
hydrogen series.     This
may be seen by inspec
tion in some cases. In
others it cannot be so
determined, and it was
necessary to have re
course to the calculation

puted.     The case in
which these deviations proved to be smallest is the one finally
selected.
  If the curve furnished by the relation between n and y is
an hyperbola, the derived curve (representing the relation
between n and 2) is the part above the axis of n of a parabola
such as that represented in fig. 3,       its

series, it will be found that the primary curve belonging to
the series closely approximates to an hyperbola.    If we regard
that line as the second  term,  the curve approximates,  but not

former supposition.     The values of m will then be as in the

   The coordinates in the Table are coordinates of the derived

                                               Inferences.
   From the whole investigation we may draw the following
inferences:—
   1. That the outstanding differences are sufficiently large to
warrant the conclusion that the primary curve is not an exact
                                                     º
curve of the second degree, although in the case of Series P
it approximates to an hyperbola ; in the case of Series S to an
hyperbola or ellipse, probably to an hyperbola ; and to a para
bola in the case of Series D.
    2. That the approach to the parabola is very close in the
case of Series D, but that in the case of Series P and in the
case of Series S the actual curve, as indicated by the observa
tions, is somewhat more curved in the vicinity of                  vertex                        its

has succeeded          photographing

     That in Series D there are two new terms corresponding
      6.
to negative values of n, for one of which n is approximately
—860-6, and for the other —31-17.                These positions are the
same as X=        1162,     and X = 32082. The first of these is
probably too far in the ultra-violet and the other much too
far in the ultra-red, to be observed.
   7. Similarly, in the hydrogen spectrum there seems to be a
new line in the ultra-violet, viz. the line obtained by putting
m = 1 into Balmer’s formula.               This makes n = —822:789,
which is the same as A=1215, a position, however, which is
probably too far removed in the ultra-violet for observation.
   8. Lines corresponding to negative values of n do not
appear to have been observed in any of the monad elements
except sodium, but examples of them are met with in some
of the triple-line series of the dyads.               Kayser and Runge
record what is       presumably     one   triple  group    of this kind in
the spectra of zinc, cadmium, and mercury, and what is
perhaps a second group in the spectra of zinc and cadmium
(see the photographs they give of a part of each of these
spectra, and the observations they make about them on p. 71
of their fourth Paper, Ueber die Spectren der Elemente, in the
Transactions of the Berlin Academy for 1891).
   It is not yet known what kind of perturbation within the
molecules would be competent to affect the partials of the
undisturbed motion of an electron so as to resolve the resulting
lines into triple lines.        But it                 is,
                                              nevertheless, suggestive                                to
find that   in  the    spectra      Zn,  Cd, of and Hg the constituents
of the  triple   line   corresponding            negative value
                                                        to   a             are             of   n

   LX.    The Action of the Electric Discharge on Gases and
         Vapours.    By C. LUDEKING, Ph.D., Leipsic".
I    HAVE     during the past year made a number of experi
      ments on the action of the electric discharge, as fur
nished by a Ruhmkorff coil, on gases and vapours of various
substances for the purpose of establishing, if possible, whether
or not electrolysis takes place.
   There is a qualitative difference in the products of decom
position that collect at the poles, so far as experiment enables
us to determine.
   The apparatus that     I used in the examination of water
vapour was suggested by Prof. E. Wiedemann, of Erlangen,
and may be briefly described as follows:—
                     º
   A flask, A, capable of holding nearly 1% litres, is filled up to
the neck with distilled water that has been boiled for 15 minutes
immediately previous to the experiment.        It is furnished with
a singly perforated good cork, carrying a large tube of 8
millim. internal diameter, which serves to conduct the vapour
from the flask into the sparking-tube, C ; this tube is also
8 millim. in internal diameter.          The two delivery-tubes
passing from it are 60 millim, apart. The vapour coming
from the flask A divides, in tube C, into two currents, which
pass out by the                         The electrodes consist of
copper wire 3% millim, thick; they have flat polished ends,
and are inserted into the tube C gas-tight by means of rubber
stoppers, an arrangement that permits of their being set at
 various distances from one another. They are placed in such
 positions that they are located in currents of vapour travelling
in opposite directions, as will be easily, understood. By this
means it is possible to ascertain whether or not there is a
difference in the gases separated out at the poles, for these

may be collected and analysed.             The entire sparking-tube is
encased in an air-bath capable of being heated above 100°C.,
and thus preventing any condensation.                   The delivery-tubes
are    firmly    clamped     and held in      position     with their ends
exactly on the same level. This is effected by boiling the
contents of the flask when only about three fourths full of
                                                                             off

                  do not think, with Thomson, that the molecules

   I  think        I
                 have shown that while      pure    hydriodic-acid
vapour does not conduct to any appreciable extent at ordi
nary temperatures when pure and dry, it does conduct when
diluted with any diluent.    Further, that electrolysis of vapours
is only possible  to any appreciable extent when the mechanical
action of the spark has caused such dilution of the pure
substance beforehand by dissociating it in part.
                   I
   Further, made an extended series of experiments on the
action of the electric discharge on the following gases and
vapours : viz. carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, carbon disul
phide, silicon tetrafluoride, marsh-gas, olefiant gas, and coal
gas.

   Where one of the products of decomposition is a solid, it is
for obvious reasons not possible to use the apparatus above
described to show a polar distribution of the products of
decomposition.     Now all these substances furnish solid de
       excepting silicon tetrafluoride, which was not decom
posed.
   The hydrocarbons yield deposits of carbon, and therefore it
was impossible to find a difference in the gases furnished by
our apparatus. However, a remarkable fact was observed,
which I believe speaks strongly in favour of actual electro
lysis, in the case of hydrocarbons especially. It is that the
deposit of carbon for these latter always grew out from the
positive pole in a way that would indicate        having been           its
separated out      that pole

that it can readily be demonstrated to a large audience in
lecture.
   The carbon separated out from each of these gases is the

be readily obtained in a few minutes, and on continuing the
discharge they finally connect the two poles, when the spark
ceases.   The growth of the filament is entirely avoided by
frequently reversing the current.
   By the action of the electric discharge on vapour of chloro
form no carbon filaments are formed, and chemically the
decomposition is not simple in character. There is a large
             l<U+017F>º
amount of gas formed consisting of chlorine (iodized

absorbed in   part
                    and hydrochloric acid (the gas is rapidly
                    by  water and the aqueous solution is strongly
acid), while a dark red liquid is observed on the mercury of
the eudiometer due to the solution of one of the products of
decomposition in excess of the chloroform.          A further exami
nation of this was not attempted.
   An exact measurement of the increment in volume of
vapour was out of the question, owing to the action of the
chlorine formed on the mercury of the eudiometer.
   Carbon tetrachloride is decomposed very slowly indeed by
the discharge.      As in case of chloroform, so                   fº
                                                              also no
carbon filament is formed, while the rate of decomposition is
entirely different from that of chloroform.           A voluminous
yellow deposit is observed on the walls of the eudiometer
around the negative pole and chlorine is set free, as appears
by the starch test. The gaseous products of decomposition
are not rapidly absorbed by water, as was the case with
chloroform.     A black deposit is observed on the surface of
the mercury.       Unquestionably, therefore, it follows from                   all
this that the   decomposition              of

LXI. A       Method          for   determining the Specific Inductive Capacity

        comparing the energy of a condenser charged with a
ON      certain quantity of electricity, first as a simple air
condenser, and secondly when a dielectric sheet of greater
specific inductive capacity is introduced between the plates,
we at once see that the energy in the second case is less than
in the first : since the energy equals | QV, and V the differ
ence in potential between the plates is less after the sheet is
introduced than before, Q the quantity of electricity being the
same in both cases.
   In consequence, if a sheet         say, sulphur          of,
                                                       introduced                        be

done      by

532          Mr.    J. Brown on the                 Difference              of Potential
experiments made gave results varying from 2:33 to 2:47 ;
but the alternator employed, being driven by an old type of
gas-engine, ran very unevenly and rendered observations
difficult.
   In this case it is the average value of the square of the
electromotive force which is required in calculating K, and
this was obtained directly by employing a Cardew's voltmeter
for determining the difference in potential of the plates.
    One of the advantages in the method described in this
paper is the possible avoidance (not realized, however, in the
form used by us) of             all
                         doubtful approximate calculations.                                                    It

were saturated    with the liquids to be tested, and contact
between them was made either by a strip of the same paper,
across which the two liquids soaked till they met, or by an
arrangement consisting of two small funnels with fine drawn
out ends like those shown in fig. 2. These contained the two
solutions connected by strips of filter-paper with their re
spective cylinders.    As the liquids flowed out from the fine
ends of the funnels they came in contact with continuously
fresh surfaces, thus providing a continuous renovation of the
 surface of contact and preventing any possible permanent
modification... I am not able to say, however, that this gives
 a result sensibly different from the simple paper connexion.
    The water-dropping testing funnel was provided with a
 stopcock, and                     its

     Sometimes this arrangement was replaced by a pair of
     funnels (fig. 2), as described above, carried in holes in the
     bridge C between the cylinders A, B. A second bridge H,
     also of paraffin, carried two triple-jet funnels E, F with stop
     cocks as shown. The water in each was connected to one
     terminal of the electrometer-key by means of wires enclosed
     in glass tubes and joined by platinum wires to the platinum
     plates m, n. The bridge H could be raised vertically upwards,
     sliding on the frame of the apparatus, so as to lift the jets
     clear of the cylinders, thus giving room for the supply of the
     solutions. This also provided for the reversal of the bridge
     C, which could be turned end for end ; so that by taking the
     mean of observations in the two positions, any errors in the
     funnel part of the arrangement might be eliminated.
        4. To make an experiment with this apparatus, the cylinders
     having been wetted with the given liquids, one being to earth,
     and contact between them having been established, the funnels
     were lowered into position, the stopcocks turned on so as to
     start the flow of the jets, and the deflexion read in the usual
     way by two reversals on the electrometer.          The flow was
     then stopped, the funnels raised out of the way, the bridge C
     reversed, the funnels lowered, re-started, and a second readin
     taken. A third reading with the bridge C in the ori
     position completed the abservation, and the mean of the three
                                                                                                                 .

536            Mr.   J.    Brown       on the Difference          of Potential
   5. In the course of these experiments it became very
evident that concordant and reliable results were difficult to
obtain, partly on account of the smallness of the forces to be
measured, and partly from a difficulty in ascertaining the
exact origin of these forces so as to arrange the experiment
in accord with them.         Even the sign of the electrification
sometimes reversed during the experiment, as in Nos. 12 and
21.      The results must therefore be taken as only tentative,
but in so far as they may be considered approximate they
suggest the following conclusions:—
    (i.) There is no clear connexion apparent between the
observed electromotive forces and the heat equivalents of the
reactions; but the amount of water present seems to have an
effect, either by the dilution of both solutions equally or one
more than the other.
    (ii.) The sign of the electrification may depend, however,
on the following considerations.       When double decomposition
occurs at contact of solutions of two substances, one of which
consists of an anion a and cation c, and the other of an anion
a' and cation       the products
                     c',            the reaction being
                                                 of         and a'e,          ac'
then the solution          will ac positive be the combiningif heat
a',c  is  greater than c',a and vice versä.
                                     ;
   This hypothesis appears         conform   to the following view
                                                                 to

                   molecular action that may take place.        the                 in
case, for instance,            of   the reaction
                              FeCl,   +    KAS   – K2Cl2    +    FeS,
the heat equivalent K2,Cl, being greater than Fe,S, the
molecules just before actually double-decomposing might                                    be
supposed     become polarized
               to                   the attraction between K,
                                                   by
and Cl,  and    causeso               an
                          electrification    the opposite ends    of
of   the system,
                                      +    FeCl,K,S—,
similar    to   that commonly associated with such                      a   system   as
                                 +FeCl2 potassium            –.
Although this hypothesis receives support from nearly             the                all
experiments       Table II., and also from several
                     in                                     the pre          of

electrolytic or voltaic effect of any action between the liquid
and this immersed pole has been ignored, and an error of
unknown amount has thus been introduced.               There are, how
ever, two series of experiments besides those of Exner and
Tuma mentioned above in which this error has been avoided.
In 1880 Ayrton and Perry" described an apparatus for the
investigation of the potential of liquids in contact, by their
inductive action on plates of gilt brass held close above their
surfaces.      In 1883 Bichat and Blondlott published an
ingenious method involving the dropping of one of the liquids
from a funnel whose jet was within a cylinder kept moistened
by the other.
    Partly from consideration of the large and striking character
of the results obtained by these authors with strong acids, and
Fº       in the search of a possible simplification of the problem,
    have tested a series of pairs in which acids and strong
aqueous solutions of various kinds were tried against water;
the object being to ascertain whether the observed effects have
any connexion with the heats of solution or dilution of these
substances.      The results are given in Table III., in which the
 first column contains the formulae of the substances tested,
 with the water of solution, if any ; the second column con
 tains the results of the experiments, stated separately ; and
 the third the heats of solution or dilution for the number
 of H2O molecules stated, as given by Thomsen. The heats of
 dilution for potassium nitrate and chlorate are not available
 but are probably negative since the heats of solution of the
 anhydrous salts are negative.
     A comparison between the numbers in the third and fourth
 columns shows that in the case of positive heats of solution
 there is a rough agreement between their amounts and those
 of the observed electromotive forces, while with negative
 heats the results appear variable and indefinite.
     7. Table   III.  gives also a test of an hypothesis current
 among German physicists, which, premising that the ions
 are oppositely electrified, states that “water must show against
 every electrolytic solution the potential of the faster ion.”
     I have placed after each radical a number proportional to
 this “ionic velocity,” according to F. Kohlrausch, as quoted
 in the Report of the British Association Electrolysis Com
 mittee for 1887 f. It appears that out of the fourteen pairs
 tried, in the four cases numbered 26, 27, 36, 37 water takes
 what would be assumed according to the above hypotheses as

     WITH DIFFERENT ABSOLUTE INTENSITY. BY A. KöNIG AND
J
     R. RITTER.
         PURKINJE   was the first to point out that the relative bright
     *    of different pigments was unequally influenced by a change
          ness
in the intensity of their illuminations.    In twilight blue is brighter
than red, even though for mean illumination both colours seem to
be equal. Dove and Seebeck subsequently pursued the phenomenon
more minutely, and von Helmholtz found that it was also to be
observed with spectral colours.   If two differently coloured fields
have the same brightness for mean illumination, then, after equal
diminution in the objective intensity of both, that field which is
illuminated by light of short wave-length will be the brighter, while
after an increase of the intensity the longer wave-length seems
brighter.   Some years ago Brodhun * investigated this “Purkinje's
phenomenon" quantitatively, and found that with the illuminations
he used it could no longer be observed at higher limits; that is to
say, that beyond a certain illumination   colours alter their relativeall
brightness      the same extent when their objective intensity
                        to                                                                                   is
increased            to
               the same extent.    Only      this illumination are we   at

    The observation was made so that a surface which contained
light of the wave-length 535 up (thallium green) was always kept
unaltered, and then the quantity of light expressed in breadths of
the slit was determined which was necessary to attain the same
brightness with the various wave-lengths of the spectrum in
question.   The reciprocal of this breadth of slit    call the value         I
of the brightness of the spectral light examined for the given
illumination.
    The lowest degree of illumination was very near the lower limit
of excitation, it was so feeble that the observer had to be at least a
quarter of an hour in absolute darkness to perceive it at all.       If
we call the quantity of light 1, which was necessary to produce
this brightness in the standard green field, the other shades of
brightness used are given by the quantities of light 16, 256, 1024,
4096, 16384, 65.336, and 262.144.       The last degree corresponds
about for my eye to the illumination under which a white paper,
lighted with 600 candles at a distance of a metre, appears when                              I
view it through a diaphragm of 19 millim. aperture.
   The principal results obtained by the various observers may be
summed up in the following statements, in which           data refer         all             to
the dispersion spectrum      gas-light:-   of

cathode surface can be determined.     That attraction is proportional

      OFFERED BY SCHNYDER voN warTENSEE’s Found ATION
                     FOR SCIENCE AND ART, ZüRICH.
  For the year  1894 a prize is offered by “Schnyder von Warten
see's Foundation,”  for the solution of the following problems in the
domain of Physics:—               -
   “As the numbers which        represent  the atomic heats of the
elements still show very considerable divergences, the researches
conducted by Professor H. F. Weber on boron, silex, and carbon,
regarding the dependence of the specific heats upon the tempera
ture, are to be extended to several other elements, prepared as
pure as possible, and also to combinations or alloys of them.
Further, the densities and the thermic coefficients of expansion of
the substances investigated are to be ascertained as carefully as
possible.”
  The conditions are as follows:—
  Art. I. The treatises handed in by competitors for the prizes
may be in German, French, or English, and must be sent in by
September 30, 1894, at the latest, to the address given in Art. W1.
