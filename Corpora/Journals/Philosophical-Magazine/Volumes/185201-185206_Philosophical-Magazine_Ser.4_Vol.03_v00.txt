blackened   surface may radiate against an unclouded portion of
the  sky. . After somewhat more than four minutes, the surface
is covered with a screen and directed perpendicularly against the
sun's rays.    At the end of the fifth minute the screen is removed,
and the apparatus is permitted to remain five minutes longer in
the sun.    At the end of the tenth minute it is again, as at first,
brought into the shade and permitted to radiate five minutes
longer. This operation can be often repeated if necessary. The
two quantities which are here to be made use of are, the increase
of temperature during the five minutes’ exposure to the sun, and
the decrease of temperature during the periods of radiation im
mediately before and after; the arithmetical mean of the two
latter may be regarded as the quantity of heat lost by radiation
during the five minutes in the sun. The action of the sun                                           (t)

True, the radiation in the latter case is likewise more energetic,
but not sufficiently so to annul the comparatively great increase
of temperature observed upon the glacier.
    The reverse of this must take place when the observations are
made immediately over the surface of the bare rocks, where the
temperature of the air is known to be considerably heightened.
 In this      case the thermometer placed in the sun could not differ
so    considerably         from that in the shade. This suggests to us
the great caution necessary to be observed in experiments of this
nature.
    We have also made several observations with a thermometer
with a blackened bulb, similar to the photometer of Leslie+.                                By
the pyrheliometer we obtained the increase of the temperature of a
quantity of water during an arbitrary unit of time; while instru
ments of the present description exhibit how far the respective
 thermometers, in the sun and in the shade, can diverge from each
 other, and thus furnish results which, in comparison with the
former, may be named absolute or maxima differences.                                  In our
experiments we used two thermometers, one of which was placed
in the shade, and the other, the bulb of which was blackened,
exposed to the direct sunlight.                   Instruments of this description
can only be compared with each othert.                          For the sake of bre
vity we will name the thermometer with the blackened bulb, and
which stood in the sun, the photometer.

bulb.      It is placed under a glass shade and set in the sun; notwithstanding
this, however, the results given by different instruments cannot be well
compared with each other. Compare Ritchie, Edinburgh Journal, Sc.iii.p.106.

   The absorption of the rays of light by the atmosphere varies
also with the rarification of the latter. For a luminous point in
the zenith seen from the earth's surface, the absorption amounts
to 0-80 of the brightness which would reach us did no absorp
tion by the atmosphere take place<U+017F>.       Many investigations on
the brightness  of the stars can be regarded as excellent determi
nations for the transparency of the atmosphere $; in general,
from various bodies placed on or near the surface of the Earth.” By James

however, such investigations are made more with a view to de
termine the relative brightness of the stars, compared with each.
other, than to ascertain the alterations in the intensity of their
light at various zenith distances.      For the more direct investi
gation of the transparency of the atmosphere, Saussure's diapha
mometer seemed to us to be peculiarly suitable”.             This con
sists of two white circles, in the middle of which are placed black
discs of various diameters (fig. 2).       The greater circle (aa) has
a diameter of 2 P.       F.; the black disc within it (bb), a diameter
of 1 foot; the entire circle is surrounded by a green rim (c). In
 one corner of the latter a smaller circle is similarly placed;                                                     its
 diameter
               is
               2  inches, and the diameter        the black disc within          of

 difficult still would have been the accurate measurement of such
distances      at
              these elevations.   We sometimes encountered, even
with our smaller instruments, difficulties     this nature.                       of
     Inthe application, the experimenter recedes from the discs
thus placed together, until the black centre         the smaller one                       of

   The column for Circle a contains the distances at which the
small circle disappeared; the column Circle A, the distances at
which the large circle vanished.     In the two following columns
stand the calculated   angles  under which the respective circles
disappeared.    The last column (Q) contains the ratio of the re
spective distances,   a number which, as already remarked, for a

steeper than usual.  In one single instance the transparency of
the  atmosphere seems to increase the size of objects, and that is
when the chain of the Alps are observed from the plain to the
south or north.  In moist weather, generally before the descent of
rain, the mountains appear darker and at the same time some
what larger. This illusion appears to be due to the fact, that in
the latter case they are much more clearly and sharply defined
against the horizon 4.
   The transparency of the atmosphere has the power to modify
in a great measure the magnitude of the prospect commanded
by a great altitude. This is never so great as to permit of being
calculated from the curvature of the earth and the refraction,
 for     the lower portions the prospect
        in                                         always considerably is

In  the latter case, however, another influence operates.               The
objects seen from above exhibit           uniform obscure

                      Sir David Brewster                  on      New Stereoscopes.                               17
subject,         I
           was led to construct the stereoscope in several new
forms, which, while they possess new and important properties,
have the additional advantages of cheapness and portability. The
first and the most generally useful of these forms is—
                               1. The Lenticular Stereoscope.
     This instrument consists of two semilenses, placed at such a
distance that each eye views the picture or drawing opposite to
it through the margin of the semilens, or through parts of it
equidistant from the margin. The distance of the portions of
the lens through which we look must be equal to the distance of
                                                          a is,
the centres of the pupils, which        average,    inches. The   at   an                2%
semilenses should      placed      frame,
                                    be        that their distance
                                                     in                     so
may       be   adjusted        to
                      different eyes,     shown     Plate      fig.
                                                                  as             in              II.             1.
   When              we
              thus view two dissimilar     drawings       solid object,                 of   a
as   it   seen
          is                  by
                   each eye separately, we are actually looking
through two prisms, which produce             second image          each
                                                                       a                               of
drawing; and when these second images unite,              coalesce, we                     or
see the solid object which they represent.       But order that the                     in
two images may coalesce, without any effort            strain        the              or                    on
part    the eye,
       of              necessary that the distance
                              it   is                    similar parts                   of
   the two drawings                      be
byof
                            equal     twice the separation produced
                                                        to
    the prism.   For this    purpose,  measure the distance      which                              at
the semilenses give the most distinct view         the drawings; and        of
having ascertained,                     by
                          using one eye, the amount         the refrac
      produced             distance,            quantity      or                             byof

a distance equal      twice that quantity, that
                               to                      place the draw             is,

   twice that quantity.                 not correctly done, the eye
                                                           by of

the observer will correct the error        making the images coalesce,
without   being sensible that         making   any such effort. When
                                                   it   is
the dissimilar drawings are thus united, the solid will appear
standing,            as

                                         in

     Inlooking through this stereoscope, the observer may pro
bably       be
          perplexed                 by    only the two dissimilar draw

eyes      to
          unite two     similar,      even dissimilarordrawings.    No
sooner         do
             the refracted images emerge from their respective draw
ings, than the eyes,                  this tendency, force them back

them before they again view the drawings.    It exists chiefly with
short-sighted persons, for whom the stereoscope may be con
structed with concave semilenses or quarters of lenses, placed as
in fig. 16; and when there are only two drawings, it may be
prevented      by a partition, which hides the right-hand drawing
from the left eye, and the left-hand drawing from the right eye.
     The instrument, as fitted up for use, is shown in fig. 2, where
ABCD is a frame of tin or wood, consisting of an upper and a
lower plate, and two ends, AB and CD. The semilenses are
placed in CD, with an opening for the nose at NN, a part of
the lower plate being cut away for this purpose.                The three dis
similar drawings, as shown at C, fig. 4, are placed in the end
AB, and are illuminated by the light which enters by the two
 open sides, AC, BD+.           If the drawings are upon thin or trans
parent paper, or are executed as transparencies like the diagrams
used in the magic lantern, the box ABCD may be closed, and
the light admitted only through the end AB. In the form shown
 in fig. 2, where the drawings slide into an open frame, either
 opake or transparent figures may be used.             It is often convenient
 to have the    drawings    separate,  so  that,  like the semilenses, they
 may be made to approach to or recede from one another; and
 when the drawings are thus separate, we can obtain the arrange
 ment at B, fig. 4, from the drawings at A, or                        all   of
                                                                    them from
 the three    drawings            at   C.
     While the semilenses thus double the drawings and enable                                         us
 to   unite two      the images, they
                      of                     the same time magnify them,

because their distance    from the eye is intermediate. In the
accompanying model this effect will be distinctly seen, by placing
three small wafers of the same size and colour on the square
summits of the drawings of the comes or four-sided pyramids.
No change is produced in the apparent magnitude of these
circles by making one or more of them less bright than the rest,
and hence we see the incorrectness of the explanation of the size
of the horizontal moon, as given by Dr. Berkeley*.
   When the observer fails to see the object in relief from the
cause already mentioned, but sees only the two drawings, if there
are two, or the three drawings, if there are three, the plane of
the drawings appears deeply hollow ; and, what is very remark
able, if we look with the eccentric lenses at a flat table from
above, it also appears deeply hollow; and if we touch it with
the palm of our hand, it is felt as hollow, while we are looking
     it,                     hollowness disappears upon shutting

                       3. The Single Prismatic Stereoscope.
   The prismatic stereoscope, represented in fig. 8, consists of a
single prism P, with a small refracting angle, capable of refract
ing the image of the figure A, so as just to combine it with the
dissimilar figure B, seen directly by the right eye.        The second
picture should be placed close to A, in order that they may be
united by a prism with the smallest refracting angle.           There is
a slight degree of colour in the refracted image, but it does not
injure the general effect. The prism, therefore, should not be
made of flint-glass, or any glass with a high dispersive power.
A single face ground by a lapidary upon one of the faces of a
morsel of plate-glass, the size of the pupil of the eye, will give a
prism sufficient for every ordinary purpose.          Any person may
make one for himself by placing a little bit of window-glass upon
another piece inclined to       and inserting  it,  the angle between            in
them      drop
          a            of
                  water. When the      figures  are small and near one
 another,     water prism with the requisite angle will scarcely
                a
 produce any perceptible colour*.

                        5. The Double-Reflecting                        Stereoscope.
     In this form of the instrument                           a second reflector is added for
the right eye, as shown at M'N', fig. 11, and the effect of this is
to exhibit at the same instant the raised and the hollow cone.
The image of B seen by reflexion from MN at the point C is
combined with the direct picture of A, seen by the right eye,
and forms a hollow cone; while the image of A seen by reflexion
from M'N' at the point C, is combined with the direct picture
of B, seen by the left eye. These reflectors may be placed in an
elliptical tube, with an opening near the end AB to illuminate
the figures A, B, or we may dispense with an opening by having
the figures drawn upon thin or transparent paper. When the
figures are drawn in transparent lines on a ground of opake
varnish, like the diagrams in the magic lantern, the effect is
very fine.
    Another form of the double-reflecting stereoscope is shown in
fig. 12, which differs from that shown in fig. 11 in the position
of the two reflectors, and of the figures to be united. The
reflecting faces of the mirrors are turned outwards, their distance
being less than the distance between the eyes; and the effect of
this is to unite into a hollow cone the same figures which the
other form in fig. 11 unite into a raised one. The superiority
of this position of the reflectors                        is,
                                      that they are more easily en
closed    in tube,

ance and relief as if we had viewed the colossal statue with eyes
25 inches distant.   But the reproduced statue will have also the
same  appearance   and relief as a statue a foot high, reduced from
the colossal one with mathematical precision; and therefore it
will be a better and a more relieved representation of the work
of art than if we had viewed the colossal original with our own
eyes, either under a greater, an equal, or a less angle of apparent
magnitude.
  We have supposed that     a statue a foot broad will be seen in
proper relief by binocular vision; but it remains to be decided
whether or not it would be more advantageously seen, if reduced
with mathematical precision to a breadth of 2% inches, the width
of the eyes, which gives the vision of a hemisphere 24 inches in
diameter, with the most perfect relief.    If we adopt this prin
ciple, and call B the breadth of the statue of which we require
dissimilar pictures, we must make n=

                   IV.    Notice of a Chromatic Stereoscope.
 By Sir DAvid             BREwsTER, K.H., F.R.S., V.P.R.S. Edin.*
              year 1848,       I
                               communicated to the British Association,
IN attheSwansea,          a brief notice of the principle of this instru
ment+.                             -
  If we   look with both eyes through a lens, about 2% inches in
diameter or upwards, at an object having colours of different re
frangibilities, such as the coloured lines on a map, a red rose
among green leaves, or any scarlet object upon a blue ground,
or in general any two simple colours not of the same degree of
refrangibility, the two colours will appear at different distances
from the eye of the observer.
    In this experiment we are looking through the margin of two
semilenses or virtual prisms, by which the more refrangible rays
are more refracted than the less refrangible rays.    The doubly
coloured    object is thus divided into two as it   were, and the
 distance between the two blue portions is as much greater than
the distance between the two red portions (red and blue being
 supposed to be the colours) as twice the deviation produced by
 the virtual prism, if we use a large lens or two semilenses, or
by the real prisms, if we use prisms.
   The images of different colours being thus separated, the eyes
unite them as in the stereoscope, and the red image takes                                       its
place nearer the observer than the blue one,           the very same        in
manner        as
            the two nearest   portions     the dissimilar stereoscopic

    V. Account of Experiments with                            a   powerful Electro-magnet.
                            By   J.   P.    Joule, F.R.S.             &c.”
     OME    years ago            I
                         announced that if a particle of wire con
        ducting a voltaic current be made to act upon a very large
surface of iron, the intensity of the induced magnetism will not
be much diminished by an increase in the distance of that par
ticle from the surface of the iron. Guided by this principle,                                     I
constructed a very powerful electro-magnet in 1843t, and soon
after prepared the iron of the electro-magnet employed in the
experiments related in the present paper. This was a plate of
the best wrought iron, 1 inch thick, 22 inches long, 12 inches
broad at the centre, but tapered thence to the breadth of 3inches,
as represented in the adjoining sketch
(fig.   1). The plate was then bent into
a  semicircular shape,            bring
                                     so    as   to                 its
ends within 12 inches of one another.
Previously      fitting
               to           this bar up                       as   an
electro-magnet,    made I   few experi     a

had hitherto done.

                       which was wound
four times round the broadest part                                 of
the iron, and close                  its
                          surface; the other was also wound four

   Experiment II.-Having provided a pair of tapered poles ter.
minating in vertical edges, 1 inch long and ºth of an inch in
breadth, I caused them to be slid on the poles of the electro
magnet until within 13 inch from each other.       A cylindrical
bar of bismuth       inch long, l;
                                 4 of an inch in  diameter,  and
weighing 174 grains, was suspended by a filament of silk from
a proper support, so as to vibrate between the tapered poles.
The average numbers of vibrations in each minute of time through
the quadrant of a circle were then found to be—
           with      1   cell in a series of               1    .     ..       .      44 vibrations.
           ... 4 cells                 ...                 2    .         .    .      9;             ---

The currents being as 1, 2 and 4, and the vibrations 43, 9; and
 17, or nearly in the same ratio, it follows that the repulsive action
of the magnetic poles was as the square of the current, and con
sequently that the diamagnetism of the bismuth is a quality not
self-inherent, but induced by the magnetic action to which it is
exposed.     I am happy to have been thus enabled to confirm the
important fact, discovered by M. Ed. Becquerel and Dr. Tyndall,
by experiments made without any knowledge* of the researches
they were conducting almost simultaneously on the same subject.

this result was only one-tenth of that which, in the present in
stance, did not produce a greater attraction than 175 lbs.        It is
therefore improbable that any force of current could give an
attraction equal to 200 lbs. per square inch.

        If a volume
                 of any other gas, as chlorine, be made to combine
with the hydrogen, the action, it would seem, can be consistently
imagined in the following way.        Each particle of either gas
previously to combination has on it both positive and negative
electricity; this may be sufficiently symbolized by writing +...—
for either particle, where the dot signifies the atomic centre to
which the two signs belong.     On bringing a particle of hydrogen
near to a particle of chlorine, the electricity may stand thus,
 +.              before combination,               and +...+                        in    hydrochloric acid.
There is in this process               a transfer,           but no generation of electricity.
appear; and consequently we have here a system of polarization which
produces no external effect. This experiment can be conveniently made
with the ordinary condenser, the only alteration required being to insulate
the moveable plate. The common Leyden jar affords another example of
this species of electric distribution, which I suppose to exist in the mo
lecules.
   My intention in this paper was not to state any new opinions as to the
nature of electricity, but to take the old and generally serviceable electro
chemical theory, and, after making a few necessary repairs, to apply it to
frictional electricity; so that, when this electro-chemical theory receives                                         its
true physical interpretation, frictional electricity may             simultaneously             be
explained.      Perhaps, however,      had better briefly state my present views,

  The particles of a substance, on approximating each other,

   Now, since combination generates heat, and decomposition
consumes heat, the same, according to this theory, must take
place with cohesion; and thus may be so         explained the loss           far

 42                 Mr. R. Phillips             on     Frictional Electricity.
 may be supposed that the increased effect, which is uniformly
 observed with hot water, may be only the result of an improved
                 I
 insulation, take the following from the notes of the experi
 ments, which extract I omitted at the time of publication as not
 then appearing of much importance.
    The stream of water, by flowing along the arm of the tin pipe
  (108.), produces a breeze through the pipe; and the current of
 air thus carried forward must convey away the negative elec
 tricity, as from the circumstances of the experiment there is no
 other outlet for the negative electricity.  Accordingly, on nearly
 closing the orifice of the shorter arm of the tin pipe with a bung,
 the production of the positive electricity is diminished; and so
 is also the current of air, which, however, continues to escape in
 some measure from the other end of the pipe.       This is precisely
 similar to what happens with an ordinary electric machine, the
prime conductor of which soon ceases to afford much electricity
if the negative electricity is retained on the rubber. Now                                                       I
observed, when cold water was discharged from the fountain,
that on closing the shorter arm of the tin pipe, the quantity of
positive electricity transmitted to the electrometer was scarcely
diminished, but that with hot water the effect was very striking.
The only explanation of this                           is,
                                         think, the following: the
                                                         I
quantity       of
             air which  passed   through  the tin pipe being the same
under similar circumstances with either hot           cold water, that
                                                                               to or
with the cold   water, the air which continued       escape   after the
bung was inserted, was nearly sufficient         convey away        the  to                                all
negative electricity; while with the hot water         much negative               so
electricity was produced, that the same quantity          air was quite                 of
inadequate for            its
                     removal.
   Perhaps the reason why water        always positive when rubbed

diminution in the elasticity of the condensed volume of gas;
therefore the gaseous particles, after having undergone reflexion
from the walls of the tube, possess a lower velocity than that
which they previously had.
   Dr. Faraday's theory may perhaps be regarded as a particular
instance of this more general theory of abrasion.       On bringing
the two surfaces together, certain particles which are most favour
ably circumstanced may discharge to each other.        No frictional
electricity is produced by this operation; but the particles are
united by cohesion, and could remain thus combined for an inde
finite period without interfering with the subsequent process,
which consists in the rending of these two sets of particles from
each other, and which, as in other instances of permanent abra
sion, developes the electricity.   The following appears to be an
example of this process, and there are plenty of the same sort.
Place melted sealing-wax on a glass plate—this brings the two
surfaces so near together that they discharge and cohere; on
rending the sealing-wax from the glass, the electricity is de
veloped.
   The production of hail cannot generally be unaccompanied
with the development of electricity. We know from Dr. Waller's
observations, that hail at one period of                   its
                                               formation consists                             of
conglomerations        snow mingled with water.

 they come exactly to the same condition with respect to the
  distance between their particles; but we shall also see that the
 cube which contracted lost more space than was gained by the
 other. The coefficient of expansion increasing with the tempe
 rature, there must be more space lost from 1000° to 500° than
 gained from 0° to 500°.
     If, instead of the colder cube of iron we substitute a cube
 of ice, we find that the ice expands until it reaches                melting                                     its                  l

dispense with the idea of attractions and repulsions between the
particles of matter.
   (16.) But if these “forces” do not exist, if the particles of
matter are passive with respect to each other, what is their bond
of union ? what makes them cohere : A little consideration
shows us that no change occurs in one direction only; no change
in the conditions of matter or motion takes place without an
opposite one being produced at the same time; hence what is
called cause and effect, action and reaction, &c., one being always
accompanied by the other.           However disguised            opposite may             its
be, still for every change          opposite must exist. Grove’s “cor

from the hands of the Creator.                             I
                                     do not speak theologically;
but, philosophically considered, the molecular constitution of
matter proves that the present arrangement of things must have
existed since their formation.
   (20.) I do not think then that it is necessary to suppose an
attraction exists between the particles of bodies to account for
their coherence; and as to repulsion, to account for the dilata
tion of a gas when pressure is removed, I think it not only un
necessary, but inconsistent when applied to different cases. For
instance, it is generally imagined repulsion is the only force
operating in gaseous bodies, whether this repulsion is attributed
to that force existing in the particles of matter themselves in the
state of gas, or resulting from the repulsive power of the sup
posed subtle fluid, heat.   When, however, a cold body is placed

one being the more apparent effect, the changes are ascribed to
ATTRAction ; but when one body is gaseous, expansion being
the more perceptible action, the changes are said to be owing to
REPULSIon.    These changes, however; manifestly result from
the same cause in both cases—the law that relative volumes must
be attained, and opposite movements simultaneously exist.

            showed in (14.) that the nearer the particles of a body
are to each other, the greater expansion or contraction do they
compensate in other bodies by a reverse movement; so that if
we could compress iron, suppose at 32°F., ever so little, it would
occasion a great increase in the bulk of a gas.       We also saw,
that the further out the particles were removed, the greater the
distance they afterwards moved for the same amount of contrac

50          Dr. Woods on the Heat of Chemical Combination.
It is that the limit of the approach of the masses is determined
by the state of expansion among the particles;                two bodies
                                                                                              or,   if
are heated, their particles expand, and, when             approximation,                 in
they recede from each other.       Many experiments show this fact.
The most elegant        that    Dr. Powell’s with the two pressed
                                 is            of
together pieces      convex glass,
                           of        which the alterationin     Newton’s                              of
rings      by
           heat shows the recession        the glasses from each other.
                                                                  of
    (26.) The following, then,      the theory      offer

the heat       expansion produced when bodies chemically com
                 or
bine. Seeing that the approximation             any particles     always   of

                    expansion      others,          in

            said the two opposite movements being one and the
same,     seeing, too, that chemical combinations produce expan
sions      bodies, and chemical decompositions the reverse (12.),
           in
am   I not justified      saying that the heat
                                    in                chemical combina           of

quiry, as we are only looking for the cause of the heat pro
duced in chemical combination, not for the cause of the com
bination itself. I have no doubt, however, but that the clue to
the proper understanding of chemical combination lies, not in
any attractions and repulsions of particles, but in the preserva
tion of the balance between the distances of these particles of
which     Ihave spoken above.    And if we can extend the laws that
regulate the phaenomena observed among simple bodies to their
combinations, we have, I think, gained much. We divest chemi

without        its

action, viz. that affinity depends on external circumstances.       It
would be needless to quote the many instances by which this
idea is verified—instances in which the power to combine between
substances is altogether destroyed or heightened, according to
the circumstances in which they are placed.          It will be found
that in proportion    as the two  opposite effects are provided for,
so will bodies   combine,  just as condensation or expansion can be
accomplished, as the reverse is made easy.       The objection that,
because chemical action changes the properties of bodies, it can
                                                      I
not be a mere mechanical one, does not, think, hold good. An
acid and alkali combining neutralize each other’s previous effect,
and an innocuous compound results; but their properties are not
changed.      If we take a certain quantity of steam and of ice, one
will scald, the other freeze—one is solid, the other gaseous.
When mixed, the compound is innocuous, and neither solid nor
gaseous; yet it must be admitted that it is a mechanical mixture.
   (30.) I would remark, before summing up, that not only does
the approximation of diverse particles, as in chemical combina
tion, assimilate in the effect it produces, the contraction of like
particles in the same body, but that, as we noticed in (24.), the
amount of expansion or contraction in certain cases depended on
oNE of the elements only, so in chemical combinations one ele
ment determines the amount of heat or expansion also ; for
instance, oxygen uniting with several combustibles       gives the
same amount of    heat; the same base always   produces   the same
quantity of heat, no matter how different the body may be with
which it unites; these analogies between the conduct of the par
ticles of the same body, and that of particles of a diverse nature,
adding to the proof that the theory I advance to account for the
heat of chemical combination is the true one.
   (31.) I have endeavoured to condense as much as possible into
a reasonable limit, but I am afraid I have taken up too much
space, I will therefore sum up briefly what I think I have proved.
   That there is a balance between the distances of the particles
of    all
       matter, these distances being different for different bodies.
   That     preserve this balance, motion among the particles
             to                                                               of

 anextensive movement      among particles far apart  compensates             a
small one among those which are close together.

    That these propositions having been proved, show that the
heat produced by chemical combination, or the expansion occa
sioned by it among the particles of bodies, differs in nothing from
that occasioned by the contraction of like particles; that in both
cases the resulting heat or expansion in other bodies is merely
the necessary  effect, or rather accompaniment of the contraction
going on in the combining or contracting ones.

          Magazine for December, the following passage occurs
in an extract from the Comptes Rendus of the French Academy
for September 29, 1851 —“Many hypotheses have been pro
posed to account for the phaenomena of aberration in accordance
with the doctrine of undulations. Fresnel, in the first instance,
and more recently Doppler, Stokes, Challis, and many others,
have published memoirs on this important subject; but it does
not seem that any of the theories proposed have received the
entire assent of physicists.     In fact, the want of any definite
ideas as to the properties   of the luminous aether and      relations                  its

           IX. Eaplanation of an Optical Illusion.
 By Sir DAvid BREwsTER, K.H., F.R.S., & V.P.R.S. Edin.*
APQ.          eleven years ago I received from a correspondent
  well-instructed in         optics, a letter informing me that he
had composed an essay “On the seeming anomalies which take
place in the vision of persons whose eyes are either long-sighted
or short-sighted, and which, though they are most truly surpri
sing, have hitherto, as far as I can find, escaped observation.”
   “The leading fact,” he adds, “which gave rise to the com
position of this essay is as follows:—
  “If   a silhouette or black profile of the human face (the fea
tures of which should be very little prominent) looking from
Right to LEFT be placed against a window, and be viewed by a
short-sighted eye through a narrow slit (about the thirtieth of
an inch wide) in a sheet of black cardboard placed at some                                di
stance (about a foot or so) from the window, while the spectator
himself is at about the same distance from the slit, that silhouette
will be seen by that short-sighted eye looking from LEFT To Right.”
   After an elaborate investigation of the progress of the rays
before reaching the retina, founded upon the known structure of
the eye, he deduces a fundamental proposition, “from which, by
means of a train of demonstrations (which he has not given) he
shows—
   “1.     If a
            silhouette is fixed in a window looking from left to
right, and a short-sighted spectator stands with one eye shut at
some distance (two feet or so) from                    it,
                                         and moves piece      black       a        of
cardboard with     smooth edge,
                          a           about two-thirds
                                              at           the way            of
between him and the window, from RIGHT to LEFT, then            the                  as
left edge    that piece
                of          cardboard approaches the silhouette,
                                   of                                                      a
second    phantomic silhouette will appear
           or                                that left edge looking
                                                             in
from RIGHT           To
                 LEFT,    that the two silhouettes will look each
                                   so
other    the face; and this astonishing appearance takes place
         in
accordingly.”
   My correspondent deduces from his train      demonstrations       of
other two results,   one                of
                            which the cardboard and the silhou
                              in
                 change places, and are held      greater distances
                      In to
ette are made                                                     at
than before.      this case “the phantom silhouette appears                                to
come out behind the real silhouette, and     look   the same direc
                                                             to      in
tion.”        In
            the third case analogous phaenomena are seen       long                by
sighted persons, the distances               of
                                  the card and the silhouette being
varied.
   Not having  seen the demonstrations above referred         can              to, I
not    course state that they contain
      of                                     explanation     an
                                                             these                 of
apparently very extraordinary phaenomena; but upon carefully
repeating the experiments,   soon saw that the phantom silhouettes
                                        I

56         Sir D. Brewster's Eaplanation of an Optical Illusion.
 had a much simpler origin than my correspondent supposed;
 that they were not images derived optically from the real sil
 houettes, but were only phaenomena arising from the union of
 penumbral shadows of bodies held at different distances from the
 eye, and seen indistinctly by persons with every variety of sight.
     When a finger of each hand, A and B, is held up near the
 eye against a luminous ground, so that the nearest A does not
 eclipse the remotest B, and that both are seen very indistinctly
 with a penumbral shadow, then if we bring the two fingers
 together, the most prominent part of B seems to swell outwards
 till it meets A. Now if we suppose the edge of the finger A to
 be a silhouette, or a notched line like a saw, then it is obvious
 that when the straight edge of B comes near                         part    this     it,   a            of
 edge opposite the nose            the  profile
                                           of    will swell out and meet                                      it,
 whereas the notch below the nose will not.                In like manner the
 parts opposite the two projecting lips                              of
                                                     the chin will swell out
 till the straight edge         the finger has prominences exactly like
                                      of
                                   profile, and
                                           or                         we
                                                       shall have the appear

            the silhouette
 ance      two  silhouettes,      phantom  a   one and       real one, looking  a
at   each other.

                                                                               B     to    be   a

 standing is by no means the invariable accompaniment of the pen                                               of
 a ready writer.
     Mr. Hunt informs us that                     “if we
                                               cut a cone perpendicularly to
 the base, the section is a                  triangle.”
                                              It is so in one case only, and
  there are a million other cases where the section is not a triangle.
  The definitions are obscure ; take, for instance, the following:—
  “The centre of gravity is nothing more than the central point of
 parallel or equal forces.” In page 72 reference is made to the lean
 ing towers of Pisa and Bologna; what the lines cd and ab, referred
 to by Mr. Hunt, have to do with the matter we are at a loss to con
 ceive; they are not the lines of direction, for neither of them passes
 through the centre of gravity. In page 85 Mr. Hunt speaks “of the
 centre of gravity being no longer at right angles to the plane;” and
 in page 86 he says, “The gravity of the body is decomposed into
 two forces, one drawing it to the earth, acting at right angles to the
plane, and causing the pressure, the other acting parallel to the                                            in
 clined plane and forcing the weight down it!” It would be useless
 to comment on the infraction of the first principles of mechanics and
 of common sense involved in these quotations. Mr. Hunt's defini
 tion of centrifugal force is incorrect, being the definition of quite
 another force; and when, in connexion with this subject, he speaks
 of “an impulsive force exactly balanced against a statical power, a
 system of harmony being the result,” we confess our inability to
understand him.
    In page 121 it is stated, “that fluids issuing from orifices have a
 velocity proportional to the height of the surface of the fluid above
 the orifice.” This is incorrect; the velocities are proportional to the
 square roots of the heights.        The example in page 69 is wrong.
Did Mr. Hunt practically test Bunsen's cells before he condemned
them        An experience of many years enables us to state that our
 author's animadversions on this admirable invention are wholly
 groundless.     If the zinc collars are attacked as stated, it is the
fault of the experimenter, not of the battery.                 For the sake of
those who possess cells of Bunsen's construction we may remark,
that the chief point to be secured is a good metallic contact between
the coal cylinder and            encompassing ring; the interior
                                        its                                   the                       of

     Inpage 293 we are informed, that “if we hang                 the end               at                of   a

               it                           true    the  poles  are if opposite                of

tion on the celebrated discovery of Black is advanced is most amusing.
Speaking of the polarization of heat, our author remarks, “It may
be described, in general terms, as a power of turning the ray of heat
half round; and it is regarded as proving that the influence of lateral
vibrations are different from the onward waves in calorific propul
sion.” If Mr. Hunt were compelled to write this nonsense, we
should pity him ; but it is his own free act, and we are therefore
disposed to be angry with him.           What follows, however, is still
worse.      In page 382 we are told, “In the centre of the cornea
is a circular opening, the pupil, and within it is the crystalline lens
containing the vitreous humour.”          We entreat Mr. Hunt to think
once more.       Is there an opening in the cornea 2 Does the crystal
line lens contain the vitreous humour * With a very slight expen
 diture of trouble, Mr. Hunt might have informed himself on this
important subject, and thus spared us the pain of exposing his reck
 less inaccuracy. He has only to look into the eyes of his neighbour,
 or his cat, to convince him of at least a portion of his error.
     In page 391 we find the following:—“A very simple con
trivance, by which the relative illuminating powers may be ascer
 tained, is to allow the shadows from a single object to fall upon
 a screen, and then remove the sources of light from or towards
it until all the shadows are of the same depth; the distances
 at which the illuminating bodies are from the screen express the
 relative intensity of the light of each.”          Count Rumford would
 never agree to this; he would have said the squares of the distances.
 In the next page we find the following piece of information:—“By
 aberration is meant the difference between the real and the apparent
 place of the stars.     As the light is proceeding from them, the earth
 is moving onward; consequently they appear to be rather more
 backward than they really are in the direction of the earth's annual
 motion.” This passage is suggestive of the scientific standing of                              its

fused, and the higher manual arts are well paid, a compositor should
work at his own book; but we do hold it to be rather a curious
phaenomenon, that one of the earliest of such books should be an
attempt to associate metaphysics with mathematics, or to introduce
the former into the latter, to a greater extent than is usually done.
The following is a brief description of the character and contents of
the work.
    It divides mainly into two parts: the first, on the complete ex
planation of the symbols of algebra; the second, on the relation of
successive differential coefficients, considered as standing to each
other in the relation of product and power, or effect and cause. The
first part may be looked on as an attempt to evolve the contents of
Dr. Peacock's algebra (first edition) in a more à priori form, and to
 make them the necessary consequences of a metaphysical view of
 the fundamental operations. Those who know and profit by the
clearness of the principle of fluxions (unfortunately, as we think,
discarded with its language), will look with satisfaction at Mr. Pater
 son's attempt to reinstate the differential coefficients in their old
 position of indicating something more than result of algebraic
 operation.    Every reader who can truly profess to understand the
 subject, must, if he have thought about the progress of his own mind,
 remember how much he was indebted to the mechanical connexion
 of the function and its first and second differential coefficients with
 distance, velocity, and force. Mr. Paterson has endeavoured to put
 this connexion on a more abstract footing, and to make the laws of
 algebraic development a consequence of his treatment of                 We                    it.

 Beche to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the Geological
 Survey for the collection and classification of specimens, the result
 being that space was granted by Government for the reception of
 such specimens. As years rolled on the collections increased, addi

 logical Survey and the Museum of Practical Geology were placed

of an inch in thickness, were fixed, side by side, a little apart, with
like ends in the same direction, on and parallel to an axis, so that
they might act as one bar magnet and be revolved at pleasure about
the common axial line.          A wire, which entering at one pole was
carried    along  the axis of the magnetic arrangement, was at the
centre turned outwards at the equatorial part, and then made to
return at a distance outside the magnet to the place from whence it
commenced.        At times this wire was in three parts; the axial part
being one, a radial part extending from the centre to the surface at
the equator and there connected with a copper ring surrounding the
magnet, being another, and the part from this ring on the outside of
the magnet, back to the place of commencement, being the third;
 and each of these could revolve either separately or in conjunction
 with the other parts, the electric contact being complete in                   the                                   all

magnetic force passing through the metals is the same in all the
cases, and hence the polarity within them the same.
    The author then gives a more explicit meaning, in accordance
with the definition of line of magnetic force contained in this paper,
to some of the expressions used in the three last series of his
Researches on Magnetic Condition, Atmospheric Magnetism, &c. :
and by referring to former results obtained since the year 1830,
illustrates how much the idea of lines of force has influenced the
course of his investigations, and the results obtained at different
times, and the extent to which he has been indebted to it; and then,
recommending for many special reasons the mode of examining
magnetic forces by the aid of a moving conductor, he brings for the
present his subject to a conclusion.

   74.             Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.
      I had intended to communicate much earlier the details of this
  experiment at the Royal Institution, but was prevented from doing
  so at the time; and soon afterwards I went on the Continent in
  order to observe the total solar eclipse of the 28th of July.         This
  most interesting phaenomenon I had the pleasure of witnessing at
  the little town of Marienburg, in the north-eastern corner of Prussia.
  The observations will appear, I believe, in a forthcoming volume of
  the Transactions of the Royal Astronomical Society.          Among other
  things, I was enabled to make a satisfactory estimate of the degree
  of darkness during the total obscuration ; which proved to be equal
  to that which existed one hour after sunset the same evening, the
  weather being during that evening peculiarly serene, so as to allow
  of a just comparison.
     This Continental journey having effectually interrupted my photo
  graphic labours, I have only recently been able to resume them.          I
  shall therefore now proceed to describe to you exactly the mode in
  which the plates were prepared which we used at the Royal Institu
  tion; at the same time not doubting that much greater sensibility
 will be attained by the efforts of the many ingenious persons who
 are now cultivating the art of photography.         And it is evident that
 an increased sensibility would be as useful as an augmentation in the
 intensity of the electric discharge.
     The mode of preparing the plates was as follows:—
     1. Take the most liquid portion of the white of an egg, rejecting
 the rest. Mix it with an equal quantity of water.           Spread it very
 evenly upon a plate of glass, and dry it at the fire. A strong heat
 may be used without injuring the plate.       The film of dried albumen
 ought to be uniform and nearly invisible.
     2. To an aqueous solution of nitrate of silver add a considerable
 quantity of alcohol, so that an ounce of the mixture may contain
 three grains of the nitrate.      I have tried various proportions, from
 one to six grains, but perhaps three grains answer best.         More ex
 periments are here required, since the results are much influenced
                                                                      -
 by this part of the process.
     3. Dip the plate into this solution, and then let it dry sponta
 neously.     Faint prismatic colours will then be seen upon the plate.
 It is important to remark, that the nitrate of silver appears to form
 a true chemical combination with the albumen, rendering it much
 harder, and insoluble in liquids which dissolved it previously.
    4. Wash with distilled water to remove any superfluous portions
 of the nitrate of silver. Then give the plate a second coating of
albumen similar to the first; but in drying it avoid heating it too
much, which would cause a commencement of decomposition of the
silver.    I have endeavoured to dispense with this operation No. 4,
as it is not so easy to give a perfectly uniform coating of albumen
as in No. 1.       But the inferiority of the results obtained without it
induces me for the present to consider it as necessary.
    5. To an aqueous solution of protiodide of iron add first an equal
volume of acetic acid, and then ten volumes of alcohol.          Allow the
mixture to     repose  two or three   days.   At the end of that time it

of alcohol will                 have disappeared, and the liquid                                will   have acquired a
peculiar but agreeable vinous odour.                     It is in this state that I prefer
to   employ             it.

malies in its action which greatly influence the result.   Those pho
tographers, therefore, who may repeat the experiment will do well to
fix their principal attention upon this point. It is also requisite in
winter to warm the plates a little before placing them in the camera.
In pursuing this investigation, I have been much struck with the
wide field of research in experimental optics which it throws open.
By treating plates of albumened glass with different chemical solu
tions, the most beautiful Newtonian colours, or “colours of thin
plates,” may be produced. And it often happens that the landscapes
and pictures obtained by the camera present lively though irregular
colours.    These not being in conformity with nature are at present
useless; with this exception, nevertheless, that in many pictures I
have found the colour of the sky to come out of a very natural azure
 blue.   I hope soon to have the leisure requisite for pursuing this
 very interesting branch of inquiry, and in the mean time I venture
 to recommend it to the notice of your scientific readers.—Athenaeum,

       ON COPPER CRYSTALLIZED            BY MEANS OF PHOSPHORUS.
                                  BY F. won LER.
   The experiments of Böck and Vogel, sen., have taught us that
the whole of the copper in a solution of the sulphate contained in
closed vessels is reduced by phosphorus; crystalline laminae of greater
or less thickness, according to the duration of the reaction, having
the form of the piece of phosphorus and of a beautiful bright copper
colour, being formed.      If the pieces of phosphorus are placed in
contact with bright copper wires, reduction of the copper also takes
place upon them, and this in distinct, mostly well-formed octohedral
crystals, the form of which, when the process is allowed to continue
for weeks and months, with a quantity of undissolved crystals of the
sulphate in the solution, is distinguishable to the naked eye; at the
same time the whole of the phosphorus disappears, and the masses
of copper reduced by it are found filled inside with black pulverulent
phosphuret of copper.—Ann, der Chem. und Pharm. vol. lxxix. p. 126.
  ON   THE ACCIDENTAL COLOURS WHICH RESULT FROM LOOKING
            AT WHITE OBJECTS. BY M. D. M. SEGUIN.
   1. If after having looked for some time at a white object the eyes
are closed, a coloured image of the object is seen.   This image pre
sents a number of colours, which change little by little: as an ex
ample, I will narrate the following instance.     After looking at a
very brilliant object, such as a white screen seen by the transmitted
light of the sun, on closing the eyes the image appears at the
first moment green, olive-green or yellow; but there is a red
border   allround, followed        by
                                 much darker tints.   After few mo

approaches towards the centre        the image: the latter acquires

intensity, presenting violet, indigo, blue, green. All the colours

   Died at Boston, Lincolnshire, on the 17th of August 1851, aged
71  years.
  <U+017F>: may  be said of him, that in youth, and until his mental powers
had become  enfeebled by age, he was diligent in the attainment of
knowledge.    From his early days he was fond of books and expe
rimental science.     At a time when philosophy was by mo means
fashionable, especially about 1808 and 1809, he was amongst the
earliest projectors and friends of a Literary and Philosophical Society
in Boston, his native town. In connection with this Society, he be
came Secretary, and delivered lectures on Electricity, Optics, Galva
mism, &c., and it is believed continued        efforts    long        could       his              so              as    he
find coadjutors       act with him.

 simply for the improvement        himself and his neighbours.

  It   may well     presumed, that his Meteorological Journal, which
                             be
he  kept methodically and perseveringly for many years, and commu

                   thirty years have flown by since the discovery of
         thermo-electricity by Seebeck in Berlin.          Since that time
our   knowledge     of facts in connexion with this      subject    has been
enriched by the labours of Becquerel, Sturgeon, Matteucci, Hen
rici and others; but our advance towards principles has been
slow.     Indeed some of the facts at present generally accepted
are of so incomprehensible a nature; the results of various expe
rimenters—and even of the same experimenter at different times
—are so perplexing and contradictory, as pressingly to indicate
the necessity of further and stricter examination.             In the pro
duction of thermo-currents and the determination of their direc
tions, so many hidden influences come into play, that if one
subject more than another require the exercise of patience and
experimental tact it is this. Until very lately every attempt at
progression in this department of inquiry was accompanied by
the unpleasant conviction that there was no sure starting-point;
and hence he that would advance had to begin afresh, and

82        Dr. Tyndall          on the Progress               of the Physical Sciences:
jealously test every result of his predecessors. This is the state
of things which the   investigation of M.  Magnus is intended to
remedy, and his memoir on the subject furnishes internal evi
dence of the precision with which the inquiry has been con
 ducted.  The investigation is far from exhausting the subject,
but it lets us know precisely where we are; new and striking
facts     have been added,                   errors     have been corrected, anomalies
accounted for, and the first great step made towards the reduc
tion to haw of those inexplicable phaenomena which have hitherto
perplexed philosophers.
   The wire usually applied in the construction of galvanometers
often presents a difficulty in inquiries like the present.  That
purchased at the merchants is so magnetic as greatly to interfere
with the purity of the experiments.       To obviate this defect,
some   precipitated copper  was obtained from a galvano-plastic
manufactory; but the metal, after having been cast into cylin
drical moulds, was found so magnetic as to necessitate its re
jection. The pure metal was finally obtained in the following
manner: an excess of ammonia was added to a solution of sul
phate of copper, the precipitated oxide being thus redissolved,
and the iron mixed with the salt separated; the solution was
filtered, evaporated to dryness, and the ammonia expelled; the
sulphate thus procured was redissolved in water and precipitated
by the voltaic current. This metal, however, was exceedingly
brittle, and required to be melted eight times in succession be
fore it could be drawn into wire; when drawn, however, it was
found to answer           its
                          purpose perfectly.
     Inthe  following     pages               we
                                    shall often have occasion         speak                   to

was sufficient to give rise to a current. When a portion of a
wire which had been rendered hard by drawing was heated to
redness and thus softened, on warming the point of junction
between hard and soft, a current was always obtained.   In like
manner, when a portion of the wire was rendered harder by ham
mering, a current was produced on heating the junction of hard
and soft.
   For these experiments a particular arrangement of apparatus
was devised; and to prevent any new change in the structure of
the wire, it was rarely heated beyond the temperature of boiling
water. Particular care was also taken to preserve the points
where the two ends of the wire experimented with joined the
wire of the galvanometer at the same temperature, a condition
absolutely necessary to prevent the formation of a current at
these points          of junction.
    M. Becquerel             was the first to demonstrate,
                                                 that when a wire
is knotted and heated in the     vicinity of the knot, a current is
exhibited.   As,   however, M.  Becquerel  employed a red heat in
his experiments, it is possible that the current obtained was due
to a softening of a portion of the wire, while the knotted portion
retained its hardness.    Such a result is still more probable in
the case where the point of junction of a thick and thin wire is
strongly heated.     Up to the present time it has been an accepted
fact, that a difference in point of thickness merely is sufficient
to originate a current.
   For the stricter examination of this question two semi-cylin
ders of brass were procured, and along the axis of each a semi
 cylindrical hollow was worked out from end to end.        Into this
hollow a brass wire was accurately fitted; so that when one piece
was placed upon the other, the whole had the appearance repre
sented in Plate III. fig. 1. The slightest heating of the wire in
the neighbourhood of                       its

 fectly homogeneous,                   something similar may be expected to take
  lace.
      To decide this question, the following experiments were carried
 out:—A      brass wire 6 feet long was encircled by a number of
 pieces, each            1foot in length, cut from the same piece as the
  6-feet wire;           the short pieces were tied round the latter by a
  non-conducting thread. When the portion of the wire adjacent
  to the surrounding bundle was heated, no current was observed;
 the experiment was repeated with a second wire, but with the
  same result.
      A brass wire 3 feet long and 3 lines in thickness was so re
  duced, that a length of 6 inches of                               its

 heated       redness, and the oxide carefully removed from the sur

current, although     the radiative powers of both portions must
have been   very  different. It is thus proved that a difference in
respect to radiative power is not sufficient to originate a thermo
current.
   It has been already stated, that where a difference in point of
hardness exists, a current is produced. To examine this point
further, a number of wires each 6 feet long and 0.45 of a line in
thickness were chosen ; and of those which could bear a high
temperature, two feet in the middle were heated to redness and
thus rendered soft. Of the more fusible metals, such as tin,
lead, zinc, &c., two feet were heated in an oil-bath at 200° C.
for an hour. When cooled, the two ends of each wire were
united with the galvanometer; one of the junctions between hard
and soft was heated, and the consequent current observed.     The
following table exhibits the results of these experiments: it will
be observed that the direction of the current does not preserve a
constant relation to hard and soft.   In some cases it flows from
soft to hard, in other cases in the opposite direction.

86        Dr. Tyndall on   the Progress   of the Physical Sciences:
The two ends of the wire being connected with the galvanometer,
if either   the hard side or the soft side be heated we have                         no
action; but if one of the junctions of hard and soft be taken
between the finger and thumb, the heat of the hand is sufficient
to cause a deflection of 90 degrees. The writer has to thank
Prof. Magnus for an instrument of this kind. The wire presents
the same uniform appearance throughout; and to an observer
ignorant of the process to which the wire has been subjected, the
deportment is exceedingly striking and enigmatical.
     If
     two wires of the same material be taken, and if one be
heated and the other permitted to remain cool, on causing
the hot and cold wires to touch each other a current is observed.
This is modified if the one wire be hard and the other soft:
sometimes the difference of temperature and difference of hard
ness work together and increase the current by their united
action; sometimes they oppose each other, and a decrease of the
current is the consequence.    This matter has been investigated
very fully.   It will perhaps be well to describe beforehand the
manner in which the experiments were made.
   In a tin cylindrical vessel, AB, fig. 6, two tubes, ab and cd,
crossing each other at right angles, were introduced; each tube
had a diameter of half an inch; from         f,
                                          where the tubes crossed,
another vertical tube abutted upwards and passed through the
cover of the vessel; the three tubes communicated with each
other inside; through one of the horizontal tubes the wire to be
heated was introduced and fastened by corks at a and b; to pre
vent contact with the metallic vessel, all three tubes were lined
                                   f
by smaller ones of glass; at the wire was exposed, and rested
upon a flat piece of wood introduced beneath it; in the vertical

tube was a wooden rod which nearly filled        but could      moved
through the tube with freedom; the rod carried                    at

that the wire within had assumed the        temperature        boiling of
water, the wooden rod was raised, and the cold wire was intro
duced crossing the warm one; this being effected, the rod was
permitted     descend, and the wires were pressed together
                 to                                                the          by

    In the case both of bismuth and antimony the bars (A) are
more positive, and the bars (B) more negative, in the thermo
electric series, than any other bar which can be formed of the
same metal.       The thermo-electric force between the antimony
(A) and the antimony (B), and between the bismuth (A) and
the bismuth (B), is pretty considerable.            If a bar intermediate
between (A) and (B) be taken, that is to say, such that the direc
tion of     its
              length       otherwise inclined

bismuth and the cold bismuth, the warm antimony and the cold
antimony, different experimenters have arrived             different results.        at
Vorsselmann          Heer, the last who has occupied himself with this
                          de
subject, has observed the current               pass sometimes from the
                                                                  to

                                         other times from the warm metal
to   the cold. He concluded from his observations, that the direc
tion  of  the current depends           the greater    onless difference        or                                of
temperature between the two bars.                These cases        reversion                  of
exhibited themselves               especial

    That such experiments should have any value,                   absolutely             it   is
necessary that the bars made use                                   of
                                                 should occupy the same
place  in   the thermo-electric series.       Thus, for example,         must                            we
compare (A) with         (A),  and (B) with (B), but not (A) with (B).

been proved by multiplicd experiments.
    Another memoir on this subject by M. Franz of Berlin has
recently appeared in Poggendorff’s Annalen.        He uses cubes of
bismuth. The cubes are placed between two small copper pillars
connected with a galvanometer; the pillars are moveable, and
thus permit of the cubes being pressed together. We will call
the direction from pillar to pillar the axial direction, and that
perpendicular thereto, the equatorial.    In some cubes the plane
of most eminent cleavage formed two of the opposite sides, and
in some the said plane was inclined at an angle of 30° or 60° to
two opposite sides.    When two of the former were so placed that
the cleavage throughout both stood either axial or equatorial, no
current was observed on heating.       When the cleavage of one
 cube was axial and that of the other equatorial, there was a deflec
 tion of 45°. When a pair of the other cubes were placed so that
the cleavage of each made an angle of 30° with the plane of the
horizon, a current of 30° was observed; when the angle with the
horizon was 60°, the deflection was 19°7.         Bismuth was also
found to   change            its
                      thermo-electric  power      contact with other in

These results appear    stand     intimate connexion with those

that derived by plotting the 5th series falls considerably below
those obtained by plotting the 6th or 7th.             A mere inspection
of the table exhibits the same in      particular   cases.    For example,
a difference of  temperature    of 268°-64 between iron and platinum,
corresponds in the third series to a difference of 13°71 between
bismuth and antimony; whereas in the 6th series, a difference
of 268°-66 between the former corresponds to a difference of
17°77 between the latter; and in the 7th series, a difference of
268°56 is equivalent to one of 18°-60.         It hence appears that the
thermo-electric force of iron and     platinum    is relatively greater in
the 6th and 7th series than in the 5th. We shall now endeavour
to account for this hitherto inexplicable result. Turning to the
table at page 85 of this Report, we observe that the current formed
at the junction of hard and soft in an iron wire passes from hard
to soft, which proves that the iron is rendered more negative when
it is softened by heat. Let us now devote a moment's attention to
the result with platinum wire at page 87. In the case of two ho
mogeneous wires, the current passes from warm to cold, causing
a deflection of 24° when both wires are hard.            When a hard and
soft wire are taken, and the former is heated, the current passes
as before from warm to cold, causing, however, a deflection of
only 13°.      It thus appears that the soft wire is less negative, or
what is the same, more positive than the hard wire.               Consist
ently with this, if the heated wire be the soft one, the fact of                           its
being hot and soft         the same time ought
                            at                                      to

developed     amaximum—this         the case.  isThe deflection observed
under these circumstances          36°.   is
    The   general  facts  being thus established, that iron, when soft
ened     byheat, becomes more negative, and that platinum, when
softened      by
               heat, becomes more positive,                         let
                                                            apply them    us               to
the case before us.       M.  Regnault  commenced his 5th series with
a  fresh couple       iron and platinum, increasing the difference
                     of                                                                    of

creasing to 282°18; then, without interrupting the series, allows
the difference to sink again to 148°-97. The bismuth and anti
mony equivalent for this is 12°–30; whereas for a difference of
152°29 between the iron and platinum, before the difference of
temperature had reached the above amount (282°18), the antimony
and bismuth equivalent is only 11°-69.     This fluctuation in the
7th series causes the curve derived from plotting to present
somewhat of the appearance of a railway section over undulating
ground, whereas in                   all

   To attain a more varied change of tint, Parrot 4 made use of
a rotating  disc on which were laid sectors of prussian blue; he
thus obtained a mixed colour capable of far greater modification.
His instrument was also divided into degrees. It seems, how
ever, very difficult to obtain instruments of both descriptions
which are quite capable of being compared with each other.
After some experiments, we found it advantageous to apply the
colours in a different manner; and instead of expressing the
tint in degrees, to express it according to the proportions of the
mixture. We constructed two cyanometers, the first was of the
same form as that used by Parrot.       A disc 20 centimetres in
diameter was covered with a layer of white lead, a substance
which, when properly manufactured, possesses everywhere the
same degree of whiteness, whereas different descriptions of white
bleached paper vary greatly from each other in this respect.
The rim was divided into 100 degrees (1° being = 3-6 of the
usual divisions), and by means of these the whole surface was
divided into distinct sectors.   This disc was fixed upon another
of pasteboard by means of little supports, which sustained the
centre and the rim merely.     The rest of the space between both
discs was hollow.    From three points situated 33.3 of the rim
divisions  apart  (120° in the common sense), a knife was drawn
along the corresponding radii. Through the slits thus formed,
blue and black segments could be pushed in until the required
portion of them was visible upon the surface; the remaining
portion slid into the hollow space between the discs.    The blue
segments were coloured by a layer of cobalt (oil colour) carefully
laid on; on the others was placed a layer of raven-black (oil colour).
These colours can be found everywhere, and exhibit such slight
deviations of shade that they may be regarded as constant.                                      Pl.

mately mixed, and of being uniformly laid on the surface, which
in our case was that of weakly-sized Bristol-board. In this way
we obtained fifteen divisions of a scale; the first of which was
white, and the last pure cobalt.      The difference from one division
to the next was a matter of indifference in the application of the
instrument, as the per-centage content of cobalt and not the
number on the scale was noted.          The increase of cobalt from
one division to that next to it was not uniform. We endeavoured
to have the differences of shade from leaf to leaf tolerably alike;
and here we remarked, that a uniform addition of cobalt becomes
      i.
less appreciable when a considerable quantity of the colour is
already present.      In the last leaves, therefore, we used a greater
proportion of cobalt than in the first; the immediate object of
the latter was to render the instrument more uniform.

the               rather than of the colour; it        however,     some      is,                          of

           on the Optical Phanomena       of the Atmosphere.             99
of the increase at heights above 6000 feet coincides, in the Alps,
with the disappearance of the larger valleys. From this forwards
the alterations, as we ascend, are very uniform *. A correspond
ing point of greater acceleration is not therefore to be expected
at the same height on mountains whose mean altitudes are un
like. This point would move upwards as the heights of the
mountains increase.    The latter assertion is corroborated by a
comparison of the observations made by Alexander von Humboldt
on the Andes and on the Alpst.
     We have heretofore confined ourselves to       a comparison     of the
maxima depths of colour at different elevations; although a
regular increase is here exhibited, the higher and lower situations
approximate very near with regard to the degree of shade to
which the blue of the sky can sink. We observed in some                  in
stances, at a height of more than 7000 feet, 35 per cent. and
less of cobalt when no trace of cloud or fog was to be perceived
either with the naked eye or with the telescope.         A singular
clearness of the heavens is observed in the zenith   itself, even at
the greatest elevations, at the beginning of the morning twilight.
The minimum occurs on ordinary days between 2 and 3 o'clock
in the morning, the maximum a little before noon; the firma
ment is afterwards in general lighter on account of the ascent of
vapours.
   The difference between the maximum and the minimum bright
ness within twenty-four hours increases with the height, because
the minima in high and in low situations are very similar; for
the same reason the differences between max. and min. are greater
in the tropic regions than in higher latitudes:
  * How considerably the presence of valleys can alter the increase of blue
as we ascend   is very evident from the observation of Saussure, that Cha
mouni has often a less deeply coloured sky than Geneva.
     tWith regard to the different attempts made to explain the colour of
the atmosphere, see the elaborate memoir of Forbes, “The Colours of the
Atmosphere with reference to a previous paper, “On the colour of Steam
under certain circumstances.’”—Philosophical Magazine, vol. xiv. pp. 121,
419.   And Pogg, Ann. 1842; Supplementary volume, vol. i. pp. 49–78.
Compare also the interesting memoirs of Clausius, “Ueber die Natur
derjenigen Bestandtheile der Erdatmosphäre durch welche die Lichtre
flexion in derselben bewirkt wird.”—Pogg. Ann., vol. lxxvi. pp. 161–188;
and “Ueber die blaue Farbe des Himmels und die Morgen und Aben
dröthe.”—Pogg. Ann., vol. lxxvi. pp. 188–195.       It is shown in the last
memoir, that in the reflexion of light from thin plates the blue has the
advantage; in the transmission of the light, the orange has the advan
tage. That the blue of the heavens is due to reflected light is also corro
borated by experiments on polarization.     In this respect there is scarcely
any difference observed between high and low situations.         Forbes, who
examined the polarization on the summit of the Jungfrau, found it “nor
mal, but somewhat less strong than in the depths below.”—Desor. Eaccur
sions, p. 405.

  If the side portions of the heavens be examined, a decrease in
the depth of blue is observable which does not seem to be irre
gular.   Alexander von Humboldt's observations on the Atlantic
Ocean (18° 58' N. L.)—at a place, therefore, where lateral dis
turbances through local changes of temperature, so common in
mountains, was not to be feared—proved that the blue colour
varied nearly as the cosine of the zenith distance *.  In commu
nicating these observations, we retain the original division of the
cyanometer of Saussure into degrees.

   The same law may be recognised through many of our obser
vations, but rarely with this exactitude.   The zenith distance
must be always measured by a proper instrument, and not esti
mated by the eye alone.   In the latter case the peculiar shape
of the dome of the firmament might be the source of considerable
error.   Thus by contemporaneous observations made on the
Johannishiitte, we found—

  The similarity between these results and those in the foregoing"
table will appear more evident when it is remembered, that one
degree of Saussure corresponds to 3 or 4 per cent. of cobalt in
our case. The unequal increase between every two of Saussure's
degrees, when the latter are expressed in per-centage of cobalt
(compare p. 95 above),              can have no disturbing influence here.

102              Dr. H. Schlagintweit's Observations in the Alps
   The foregoing table shows, that for different points of the
same vertical circle the decrease of the blue is accompanied by a
decided increase of the ochre.    The ochre appeared strongest at
the horizon of the Grossglockner. The atmosphere in this por
tion had therefore a slight tint of green*, which resulted from
the blending of the three colours, blue, yellow and white.
   White objects seen from a distance have always a yellowish or
reddish tint imparted to them by the atmosphere.      This is plainly
observable on  clouds,  houses, snow-covered   slopes, &c.    It is a
general rule, that, in the painting of such objects, a little ochre
must be added to the white. The colour of the brightest cloud
masses, even when the sun is in a high position, contains gene
rally from 1 to 2 per cent. of ochret.     Distant mountains often
appear blue when the sun is opposite; their own colour seems
to have some influence in this case, as the same mountains in
winter when covered with snow show a reddish-white colourt.
Those summits of the Alps which are covered with perpetual
snow, when seen from a great distance in direct sunlight, exhibit
this reddish tinge blended with the whiteness.
   The colouring of the light by                            its

we observed the same twice.
  A  related phaenomenon, which we had the opportunity of ob
serving, deserves to be mentioned here.    From the crest of the
Wildspitze, on the 18th of September 1817, we had a fine pro
spect towards the north.  The entire series of the northern lime
stone alps, from Salzburg to the Bodensee, was unfolded before
us with extraordinary clearness.   In the mean time a storm
blowing towards the north increased in violence, and before we
attained the summit (11,489 P. F.) the northern mountains
exhibited an extraordinary colour. They had obtained a deci
dedly red tone, although the sun stood high, it being but 3 o'clock
in the afternoon. We had left the summit scarcely half an hour,
when immense cloud-masses were driven upon us from the side at
which the red colouring had been observed. During this time the
barometer fell considerably.        It seemed as if the watery vapour
of the atmosphere, during                            its
                                    gradual condensation          mist, had                                 to

   The red colour in the present instance appeared sometimes
more intense than is generally observed on plains. When the
light falls upon the fog, it exhibits the usual uniform gray,
similar to a mixture of 91 white with 9 per cent. black.
   A few words now remain to be said upon the duration of the
twilight.    It is everywhere known in the Alps, that on high
mountains the duration is longer, although this is sometimes
over-estimated.      It may be almost regarded as a tradition re
peated for every mountain, even when it is but a few thousand
feet high, that the evening and the morning twilight touch each
other at midnight. Though this is an exaggeration, a difference
in the duration of the twilight is very appreciable in the higher
regions.    As the horizon expands from an Alpine summit, it is
evident that the higher we ascend the greater will be the arch
which separates sunrise from sunset, and hence the longer the
 day.    In valleys, on the contrary, it often occurs that the direct
 sunlight is held back by interposed mountains, and hence is
present only a few hours of the day.       The feeble twilight is also
considerably diminished by the same cause; thus the position of
 valleys with regard to the horizon may be such, that night sets in
 very soon after the setting of the sun *. The twilight, in our lati
 tude, continues on an average upon the plains until the sun has
 descended 18° under the horizon. Upon mountains the sun attains
 a much greater depth before the twilight departs+.         It is diffi
 cult to express this with exactness, as the alterations in the
transparency of the atmosphere                   on different       days exercise   so
considerable an influence.

        space left vacant in the upper part of a long glass tube,
     which after being filled with mercury is inverted in a basin
of the same metal, affords the nearest approach to a perfect
vacuum which has hitherto been obtained.      It is true that it
contains a little inercurial vapour at the ordinary temperature
of our summers, and probably also at lower temperatures; but
the quantity is exceedingly small, and     influence  its

by ebullition.   This is best observed by inclining the tube till
the  mercury   comes into contact with the upper end, when any
air that may have been diffused through the vacuum will be
seen collected in a small bubble, but greatly rarefied.     It is easy
to calculate approximately  the depression of the mercurial column
produced by this residual air. For this purpose the tube must
be inclined till the bubble is exposed to a pressure of a few inches
of mercury, measured in a vertical direction. In this position
its apparent diameter is measured, as also the pressure to which
it is exposed. For the object in view, the volume of the bubble
may be calculated on the assumption that it is a sphere.   The
space occupied by the vacuum must also be estimated; and with
these data, the depression of the mercurial column may easily
be calculated.

vacuum obtained by this process, arises from the difficulty of pre
paring carbonic acid gas perfectly free from air. . This may be
very nearly overcome by adopting precautions which are well
known to practical chemists.    When an extreme exhaustion is
required, the gas-holder should be filled with recently boiled
water, and the first portions of carbonic acid that are collected
in it should be allowed to escape.
   The substitution of phosphoric for sulphuric acid would re
move the possibility of either aqueous or acid vapours being
present even in the smallest amount, but such a refinement will
rarely be found necessary.

 airwould     rººdth part

must have been     nearly  realized.                       If
                                          the exhaustion had been
carried     at

not continue     keep pace with such small magnitudes.

   The body of the pile is sheltered against variations of tempe
rature by filling the entire chest with carded cotton. In the side
opposed to that which contains the analyser is a rectangular
glazed window, through which by means of a good thermometer
the temperature of the envelope can be read off.     Finally, a little
hole  pierced  in the bottom permits  of the  passage  of two wires
from the poles of the pile to the rheometer.      The whole is pre
served in a place less warm than the surrounding atmosphere,                                                    ,
so that during the experiments the pile must necessarily be
affected by any accession of heat.    The sense of the deviation of
the rheometer serves to prove that this condition is fulfilled.
   The chest furnished with horizontal axes of hard wood turns
in a rectangular frame, which permits of the pile being retained
at any angle whatever with the horizon, in the vertical plane
which it describes.    This angle of declination is estimated on an
appropriate dial by means of a plummet and an index which fol
lows the chest in its motion. The frame, in its turn, moves
round a vertical foot, in which it is steadied by friction.

azimuths are read on a fixed horizontal dial, which permits of
the adjustment of the apparatus.      No magnetic          ought to
be used in the construction of the latter.

When the calorific radiations are weak,                                I
                                                   found the compensator
of M. Melloni to be of     service,  more    especially  as the object was
not to obtain absolute    measures,     but the ratios of the deviations.
    Operating in the manner just described, it is found there are
two positions of the analyser 180 degrees apart, at which the
deviations are equal and maximum; and two other positions at
90 degrees from the former and at 180 degrees from each other, at
which the deviations are equal and minimum.               The positions of
the   analyser, which for a    given  point   of the heavens procure the
maximum and minimum            transmissions,     correspond to those of
greatest intensity of the direct bands and inverse bands of the po
lariscope of Savartº*.     They are thus determined without diffi
culty.
    The atmospheric heat can be depolarized by means of a plate
of mica placed near the extremity of the exterior tube, and per
pendicular to the incident rays.            The analyser being in the
position of the minimum of transmission, the deviation of the
index experiences no sensible diminution when the principal sec
tion of the interposed mica coincides with the plane of polarization,
while the deviation is augmented when the rotation of the mica
      its                                                                             an

XVIII.     On the supposed Identity of the Agent concerned in the
     Phaenomena of ordinary Electricity, Voltaic Electricity, Electro

     M. DoNov  AN, Esq., M.R.I.A.4
          Section     I.-On          the Constitution             of the Electric Fluid.
To ofrefer          the greatest number of effects to the least number
                 causes has been a favourite effort with those who ima
gine that, by so doing, they vindicate and hold up to admiration
what they call the simplicity of Nature's operations.    It may be
questioned, however, whether the facultics of man enable him
to perceive and appreciate what is thus alleged to be a perfection.
It being as easy for the Almighty to bring into operation a mil
lion of causes as one, the grounds are not obvious on which sim
plicity has been imagined an attribute of Divine agency.        Nor
does it appear what is meant by the term when thus employed;
for if we diminish the number of agents, we must increase the
number of their properties, in order to explain, with any degree
of probability, the diversity of natural phaenomena; hence no
thing is thereby simplified, and no advantage gained.
   Simplicity does not seem to be the order of nature: scarcely
any object is simple; almost everything is compound.           The
thousands of mineral substances that constitute the mass of
the globe are numerously compounded; they rarely consist of
single clements; and the waters which surround it are com
posed of a variety of ingredients.     Animals and plants, if we
consider their component parts in conjunction with their pro
perties, as constituting living organizations, are complex beyond
all  comprehension.     Even the atmosphere, and the solar rays
                       be it,
which penetrate        are           of
                              the same heterogeneous structure.                              If
the sun’s light       thus       compound constitution, why should
                                       of
 we  doubt that the allied element, electricity, partakes        the uni                of
versal character which the     Almighty   has  impressed     his works?            on

118         Mr. M. Donovan on the supposed Identity of the Agent
   The compound nature of the electricity which appears in the
phaenomena called galvanic has been often suspected, and the
difficulty of explaining them without some such admission has
been felt.    Dr. Davy asks—“May we suppose, according to the
analogy of the solar ray, that the electrical power, whether excited
by the common machine, or by the voltaic battery, or by the
torpedo, is not a simple power, but a combination of powers,
which may occur variously associated, and produce             the varie                                   all
                                    are acquainted”. Sir we

caloric and   lighti.   There are other conjectures which need not
 be here particularly noticed.
   That the electric fluid contains heat          clearly proved                                                         by   its

Davy.     Besides, the copper connecting wire of a voltaic battery
will attract iron filings when the series is excited; the filings
with respect to each other assuming a polar arrangement, as if
they were collected round a magnet.     The arch of flame is accre
dited as the electric current.
   But as the electric fluid exerts powers of attraction and repul
sion very different from those of magnetism, some separate ele
ment may be present in it which exercises these influences on
masses of matter, and produces other dynamic effects: it may
be different from the heat, light and magnetism, which are asso
ciated with electricity. Perhaps this may be the basis of the
fluid; and as a name to distinguish it will be convenient in the
sequel, it may be here called “electricity proper.”
   But what is it that causes the attractions of the atoms which
compose    heterogeneous           or in other words, occasions
                                      matter,
chemical combination ? is it the same as that element just spoken
of which causes attraction and repulsion of masses of matter?
Some of our eminent authorities have maintained that it is.    In
my Essay on the Origin, Progress, and Present State of Gal
vanism,    I
         have endeavoured to defend the contrary opinion;
and in the sequel of the present essay some additional considera
tions will be adduced having a similar tendency.
    The physiological phaenomena, comprising the shock and
muscular contractions, constitute an important series of effects;
they will scarcely be supposed to be produced by the light, heat,
or magnetism of the electric fluid. They may perhaps be caused
                                  I
by the element which have designated by the name of “elec
tricity proper,” in the case of frictional electricity; but it will
be a part of the object of this essay to render it probable that,
in what is called voltaic electricity, a power exists of causing a
shock   of a very different nature.
   Concerning the agent in the electric fluid which possesses the
remarkable property of coercing the magnetic needle into a
position transverse to the magnetic meridian, there is an import
ant problem to be solved: Is it the same as that element of the
electric fluid which causes attraction and repulsion of masses of
matter—the electricity proper? This is the grand question ; and
for the present I shall say no more, than that in the sequel many
arguments and facts will be adduced with a view of rendering it
probable that electricity proper is not the force which causes
deflection of the magnetic needle.      It may be either some differ
ent force, or        all
                  the forces conjointly.           is,

120           Mr. M.             Donovan         on the supposed Identity                  of the Agent
electro-magnetic, magneto-electric, and thermo-electric phaeno
mena, depends on the ratio, or variable energy, or mode of asso
ciation of the constituent elements, or on the influence of other
modifications which, under different circumstances, they are
capable of exerting on each other; in one word, that these
various classes of phaenomena are caused by different agents;–
these agents as much differing from each other as hundreds of
chemical compounds, which, consisting of the same elements,
are so combined and grouped as to constitute and be recognised
as independent forms of existence, requiring different names.
This modifying influence is probably of the same character as
that which the forces of nature exercise on each other on the
great scale of creation, controlling, antagonising, and regulating
each others’ effects; thus producing the diversified phaenomena
of the universe, but rarely acting independently. It is by op
posing forces that the earth is maintained in        orbit;    the                        its                by

128     Dr. Tyndall's Remarks on the Researches of Dr. Goodman.
described by Dr. Goodman, in cases where there was no possi
bility of an electric current being formed.
   During the inquiry on diamagnetism and magnecrystallic
action, an account of which appears in the September Number of
this Magazine for 1851, the torsion balance there described was
 placed before a window through which the sun shone during the
 forenoon. In experimenting with the spheres of bismuth, I was
 often perplexed and baffled by the contradictory results obtained
 at different hours of the same day. With the spheres of calca
 reous spar, where the diamagnetic action was weak, the discre
 pancies were still more striking.        Once while gazing puzzled at
 the clear ball of spar   resting   on the torsion balance, my atten
 tion was attracted to the bright spot of sunlight formed by the
 convergence of the beams which traversed the spar, and the
 thought immediately occurred to me that this little “fire-place”
 might be sufficient to create currents of air strong enough to
 cause the anomalies observed.           The light was shut out, and
 thus the source of       my    perplexity  was effectually cut away.
 The air-currents, however, were far more owing to the warming
 of the glass cover of the instrument than to the convergence of
 the sun’s rays; during the whole inquiry                           I
                                                      was obliged to ex
 periment every sunshiny forenoon with closed shutters. On
 mentioning this fact to Prof. Magnus, he informed me that
 during his investigation on thermo-electric currents, a report of
which appears in the present Number of the Philosophical Maga
zine, he was obliged to protect his galvanometer from the action

of the sun, as the unequal heating of            glass shade rendered his
astatic needles     quite  unsteady.             almost incredible how

experiment had             to   be

these little currents with great care. They resemble,    compare                    to

serve equability of temperature, a screen of pasteboard was often
found serviceable.     Now that a needle suspended from a silken
fibre sixteen inches  long, covered with a glass shade and placed
in  strong  sunlight, which are the conditions of Dr. Goodman's
experiments, should also be influenced by air-currents, is exceed
ingly probable, and that a permanent current of electricity should
circulate in a helix of covered copper wire with      two ends dis                     its
connected being exceedingly improbable,         appears worth the          it

Multiple Definite Integrals, it will be seen that valuable results
can be obtained, and some examples are furnished.        It will be
observed that these general principles  present the means of ex

      This is obvious, since, from the supposition made relative to
a, b, c, &c., we can operate with the symbol CI under the inte
gral signs.   It will be observed that the result bears a strong
resemblance to Liouville's well-known extension of Dirichlet’s
integral.         '
   We seem to have here made a step towards the solution of

that which has been long a difficulty in the treatment of
definite integrals, namely, the generalization of those in which
the variables enter as complicated functions in the indices of known
quantities. The most valuable extensions yet obtained are those
in which the element of the primary multiple definite integral
exhibits the variables under finite forms solely.
  We shall conclude by giving the two particular instances of
     general theorem above alluded           can           to.

XXI.     Mineralogical Notes.    By Edward J. CHAPMAN,                         Pro
       fessor of Mineralogy   in University College, London *.
      NDER           the above title, it is the intention        of the writer to
           offer from time to time a series             of remarks and investiga
tions on subjects relating to mineralogy.
   (1.) Crednerite.—If we allow the isomorphism, atom for atom,
of silica and alumina, and through alumina, of silica and the
sesquioxides generallyt, Rammelsberg's crednerite—the man
gankupfererz of Credner—may be admitted into the augite group.
The cleavage form of crednerite is certainly monoclinic; and the
angles, so far at least as they can be estimated in the specimens
hitherto obtained, assimilate to those of the augite prism. The
minerals of the augite type have the general formula 3RO,
2SiO”, which, with the substitution of sesquioxide of manganese
for silica, is exactly that of crednerite as deduced by Rammels
berg, viz. 3(Cu0, BaO), 2Mn” O°. A proof of the isomorphism
of SiO" and Mn” O’ is afforded by the manganese garnets and
spinels, and more particularly as belonging to a system of vari
able angles, by Vesuvian and Hausmannite.
   (2.) Helvine.—The helvine in the classification of Mohs bears
the name of tetrahedral garnet; and with the spinel and garnet
group it must in fact be placed, unless it stand alone, for to no
other type amongst the silicates and their isomorphs can it be
referred. On the supposition that Si O” and Mn” O” are iso
morphous, and that sulphur and oxygen are equally so, the
atomic constitution of the helvine falls into the common garnet
formula, r--R.     The composition of helvine, for instance, as
usually represented, = (Be2O3, Fe2O3), SiO2+2MnO, SiO2+MnS.
This may be reduced into three atoms of (MnO, MnS), and three
atoms of (R*O°, Si O’); or into equal atoms of base and acid,
r–H   R.
   (3.) False cleavage in Garnet.—A small garnet in the author's
possession, from the Zillerthal, exhibits a peculiar and interesting
example of false cleavage in relation to the crystalline structure
of metamorphic rocks. This garnet is a combination of a tra
pezohedron,    O, with the rhombic dodecahedron; and entirely
through        its
             mass run lines     false cleavage, parallel
                                     of                     the clea  to

   (7.) Wichtyne. Minerals of the Epidote Type.—Laurent's
wichtyne, the wichtisite of Hausmann, appears also to belong to
the epidote type—if it be not actually an altered variety of epi
dote.   It yields, however, by Laurent's analysis, 3RO, R* 0°,
4SiO2, whilst the epidote contains 3RO, 2R* O”, 3SiO3.
   The epidote type may thus consist of the following minerals:—
allanite or orthite (including bagrationite, &c.), gadolinite, epi
dote, sphene, wichtyne, chloritoid and chlorite spar.  The allan
 ite and epidote are strictly isomorphous, but their chemical
formulae are          by    no
                     means alike.  The former contains,     atoms,                                    in

   (9.) Detection of Manganese in Limestone Rocks.-A consi

                                have noticed this more particularly
in the darker   magnesian  limestones of the Permian epoch, but
also in various other limestones of different ages and from differ
ent localities. The common blowpipe-test--fusion with carbonate
of soda—generally of so delicate an appreciation, here fails, even
on the addition of nitre, to point out the presence of manganese.
This is owing to the insolubility of the limestone in the carbo
nate of soda.

   Two small strips         platinum were introduced into glass tube

helix of the instrument with different metals, a deflection of
several degrees was obtained.         The two cells before mentioned,

wooden floor was thus proved to be an incomparably better con
ductor than air heated to 400°.
   When the strips of platinum were exposed to the direct action

   Two pieces of charcoal, one of which is less heated than the
 other by the flame, deport themselves exactly as a pair of pla
tinum wires under the same circumstances.                Silver, copper,
brass and zinc, have been also examined, all of which exhibited
the same electrical deportment as platinum when brought into
 contact with heated air.
   The following conclusions are drawn from the experiments
above described:—
    1. Gaseous bodies which have been rendered conductible by
strong heating are capable of exciting other conductors, solid as
well as gaseous, electrically.
   2. When a thermo-electric circuit is formed of air, hydrogen
 or carburetted hydrogen, alcohol vapour, charcoal, or finally a
metal, whether combustible or incombustible, an electric current
is developed, which proceeds from the hottest place of contact
through the                      air
                      the less warm place.

in terms of a, b, &c., which separates the real from the imaginary

equations are then numerous enough to determine r in terms of the
coefficients of War. The author applies this method to cases as high

various problems in which more variables than one are found.

of   Vision.”—Part II. On some remarkable, and hitherto unobserved,
phenomena        ofBinocular Vision.
  The first part       of
                        these researches was communicated       the Royal                            to
Society    in   1838, and published     the Philosophical

   The second part, now presented, commences with                 account                        an                    of

     the retinae remains        constantly     the same,    the perceived     magnitude

while the inclination               the   optic

thus experimentally ascertained regarding the perceptions                          magni           of

 instrument, not only for investigating the phenomena                          binocular      of

 year,   Talbot and Daguerre made their processes known, Mr. Wheat
  stone was enabled to obtain binocular Talbotypes and Daguerreotypes
  of statues, buildings, and even portraits of living persons, which,
  when presented in the stereoscope, no longer appeared as pictures,
  but as solid models of the objects from which they were taken. This
 application was first announced in 1841.
     The two projections of an object, seen by the two eyes, are dif
 ferent according to the distance at which it is viewed; they become
 less dissimilar as that distance is greater, and, consequently, as the
 convergence of the optic axes becomes less. To a particular distance
 belongs a specific dissimilarity between the two pictures, and it is
 a point of interest to determine what would take place on viewing a
 pair of stereoscopic pictures with a different inclination of the optic
 axes than that for which they were intended.                The result of this
 inquiry      is,
               that   if  pair

 optic axes are nearly parallel, the distances between the near and
 remote points        the object appear exaggerated; and                               if,

 For this purpose the pictures, placed near the eyes, are caused                                               to
coincide when the optic axes are nearly parallel; and the diverging
                                                                                                               of by
 rays proceeding from the near pictures are rendered parallel
lenses    of  short focal distance placed before the mirrors              prisms             or
the stereoscope.
     Some additional observations were next brought forward respect
 ing those stereoscopic phenomena which the author,                        his first         in
memoir, called “conversions              relief.” They may

three different ways:—1st,                      by
                                      transposing the pictures from one eye
to   the  other;   2ndly,             by
                               reflecting   each picture separately, without
transposition; and 3rdly,                   by
                                     inverting the pictures           each eye se  to
parately. The converse figure differs from the normal figure
                                                                                                      in in

circumstance, that those points which appear most distant                         the
latter, are the nearest         the former, and vice versa.

     ON   THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF SULPHUR.                            BY CH. BRAME.
   Since the time that Mitscherlich demonstrated that melted sulphur
crystallized in oblique rhombic prisms, and confirmed Hauy's state
ment that sulphur, dissolved in bisulphuret of carbon, crystallized
out in rhombic octohedrons, the opinion has been entertained that
sulphur crystallizes in oblique prisms after melting, in octohedrons
with a rhombic base from a solution, and that the prismatic sulphur
becomes opake on account of the gradual assumption of the octohe
dral structure.
   The author now shows in his paper that rhombic octohedrons are
produced by the influence of mechanical subdivision, the removal by
means of steam of several bodies which also act mechanically upon
melted sulphur.      A temperature of 122°F. produces them in the
utricles of sulphur (utricules de soufre).         At 212°F. small soft
utricles (dendrites) are converted into rhombic octohedrons, as well
as a part of the vesicles.
   On the contrary, prismatic plates are always formed, however
thin the stratum of melted sulphur may be ; as, for example, that
which is deposited upon a glass plate when sulphur vapour at 392°F.
condenses slowly.       These crystals are generally right rhombic
prisms; but as soon as the stratum becomes only a little thicker,
the crystals obtained are oblique rhombic.
   According to the author, sulphur crystallizes in oblique prisms
from the melted state only when an excess of fluid sulphur is present,
however thin the stratum may be.         In the opposite case, the true
or modified octohedron presents itself.
   By subdivision the melted sulphur may be separated into a multi
tude of minute drops, which from solidifying upon the surface become
covered with a more or less thick crust.              If this is very thin,
the drops of sulphur are converted into utricles.          If it is thicker,
the  sulphur  drops are more or less regularly  flattened  by pressure, and
there results instead of an utricle a flattened     drop   with a quadratic
basis, which is or is not modified at           its
                                         corners, and appears altogether
like  a   considerably modified rhombohedron.          The extremely thin
coats     ofmelted sulphur  which are obtained                  by

    The author    does not consider that it may be admitted as proved,
that the    sulphur  becomes opake on account of the transition of the
oblique prisms into rhombic octohedrons.          Pasteur did not find any
octohedrons     among    the fragments  of prisms  which had been formed
from sulphur in solution ; and the author found that, in consequence
of the crystallization of the utricles, octohedrons might be contained
in the oblique rhombic prisms which are obtained from sulphur by
melting.      Therefore when octohedrons are found in prisms of sul
phur, they have originated from previously formed utricles, and do
not indicate a transition of the oblique rhombic prism into the
rhombic octohedron.—Comptes Rendus, vol. xxxiii. pp. 338–540.
            ON  THE ELECTRO-MAGNETIC MOTOR            OF FESSEL.
                               BY M. PLüCKER.
    It   is known that Mr. Page, a physicist in North America, has
recently endeavoured to produce a motive power by an extended
 application of the force which attracts a mass of iron within an elec
 tro-magnetic helix. Th. Hankel of Leipzic has made the same
 attempt, and has established an important practical law, namely,
 that this force is as the square of the power of the current. M. Fessel
 has on his part constructed a model of a machine at my request, the
 value of which I am not for the moment able to appreciate in case
 it were made on a large scale, but which as a piece of physical ap
 paratus explains and clears up the application of the force in question.
     The model of Fessel is formed of two helices placed end to end
 in a horizontal position.       They serve to conduct the current always
 in the same direction, but in such a way that it traverses alternately
 each of the two helices, and consequently only one at a time.           In
 the interior of the helices is a bar of iron, which is alternately
 attracted from the one into the other by constantly maintaining the
 same polarity, and which thus executes a motion backwards and
 forwards.      To the two extremities of the bar are fixed two slender
 horizontal shanks of brass, which rest upon two pulleys attached to
  the two extremities of the apparatus, and which thus support the
 whole weight of the iron. One of these shanks sets a wheel in
 motion.      A commutator is moved by an excentric by means of a
  directing-rod, which is placed so as to be able to make the machine
  move backwards and forwards as in steam-vessels.            In one of the
  machines the commutator has been fixed immediately to the axis.
     Two couples of Grove's cells are sufficient to communicate to this
  apparatus a great rapidity.       With six couples, the rapidity became
  such that it threatened to break the apparatus; and fearing this, I
  stopped the passage of the current.
      I have just received from him the news that he has nearly com
  pleted the construction of a new apparatus, in which he has replaced
  the pulleys by oscillating shanks of metal rod, similar to the os
  cillating cylinders of the steam-engines.—Bibliothèque Universelle de
   Genève, December 1851.

                   ON    THE PRESENT CONDITION OF WESUVIUS.
                               BY B. SILLIMAN, JUN.
   The eruption of Vesuvius in February 1850, and that of the year
previous, entirely changed the summit features of this ancient moun
tain of fire. The former crater disappeared, being filled with scoria.
and ashes, while two craters now occupy the summit of the cone.
The deepest and most active of these is that of February 1850, which
is situated on the side of the cone nearest to Pompeii.      It is some
what lower and has a much greater depth than its immediate neigh
bour, which is on the side of the bay of Naples.     We had no means
of measuring its depth accurately, but judging from the time re
quired for the returning sound of a stone cast into its mouth, as well
as from inspection and comparison, we assumed the depth of the
new crater to be from 800 to 1000 feet. It is acutely funnel-shaped
at an angle of not less than 60°. It is impossible, because of the
steam and vapours of sulphurous acid, to see its bottom, even if not
prevented by the danger of the descent to a position where one
might hope to catch a glimpse of its bottom. Its activity at present
is confined to the emission of vapour, and even this seems at times,
when viewed from the sea, to be wanting.        On the summit, how
ever, these vapours appear dense enough and are sufficient to pre
vent the possibility of making the entire circuit of the crater. From
this cause we were unable to examine the lip dividing the crater of
1850 from           its
                neighbour.   The observer       much struck not only

reference to the immediate proximity of the volcano which has pro
duced the deposit, it would be easy to refer the whole to an alluvial
origin, so characteristic are the undulating lines of deposition, the
alternation of coarse and fine materials interstratified, including now
large angular masses of rock, and again graduating into the finest
silt and mud. In some places the lines of deposition are curved in
regular undulations, and in others they meet at a sharp uncon
formable angle.      Close observation alone detects that the whole
material is   volcanic—pumice,   scoria, sand and fine dust, including
large blocks of inflated lava and tufa.
    It is impossible to see any difference in the general character of
these deposits and of those which cover Pompeii, only that the lat
ter being mostly the result of one eruption are less varied than the
former, and more regularly stratified.       In both, the evidence of
aqueous action is very obvious; and we have historical as well as
geological evidence of the eruption of vast volumes of aqueous va
pour with the lapilli, scoria and fine ashes from Vesuvius, which,
condensing into rain, produced a deluge of hot mud, filling the most
intricate recesses of the Pompeian houses, and producing the ap
pearance of an aqueous deposit in the ash hills of the flanks of Ve
suvius.     In Herculaneum we see the same phaenomena in a more
remarkable manner.       Here, owing to a much larger accumulation
of material—to     subsequent overflows of lava and the superincumbent
weight thus produced, with the aid of water, the ashes were conso
lidated into so compact a mass, that some writers have even doubted
whether Herculaneum had not been destroyed by an overflow of lava
 if the first instance. That such was not the fact is well known,
 and the condition of the antiquities imbedded there quite forbid the
 idea were no other evidence attainable.—Silliman's Journal, Sep

   ON THE SULPHUR             DEPOSITS AT SWOSZOWICE AND RADOBOJ.
   Professor L. Zeuschner has given a description of the sulphur
stratum of Swoszowice near Cracow.           It is situated in the tertiary
formation.    Sulphur and gypsum               lie
                                              parallel beds

                    was discovered accidentally in 1811 by a peasant,
and has been worked from that time. The sulphur lies in a slaty
marl, which is situated between the miocene formation and the calcaire
grossier, and itself belongs to the eocene formation.      The latter ad
joins the dolomite of the magnesian limestone, and has an inclination
rather less than 45°. The sulphur bed consists of four layers.       The
uppermost layer, for the most part 8 to 10 inches thick, contains
nodules of sulphur from the size of a nut to that of a man's head
lying separately in marl slate, and is only now and then accom
 panied by gypsum.      Then follows an argillaceous sandstone 10 to
 12 inches thick, which contains a remarkable quantity of fossil re
 mains, not only of plants, but especially of insects and fishes. Under
 it lies a second deposit of sulphur, 10 to 12 inches thick, in a dark
 bituminous marly slate from which the sulphur has to be separated
 by distillation.  A clayey bituminous marly slate, 12 inches thick,
 forms the bottom stratum.    The sulphur beds are covered by, and rest
 upon hard marly slates.—Arch. de Pharm. 2 R., vol. lxvi. pp. 315,316.

force is very far inferior to that of steam, it becomes equal and even
superior to it in the production of small forces, which may be thus

but small capitals, where the absolute amount of mechanical power

   Analysis.—About ten grains of the mixed disulphates of qui
nine and cinchonine were dissolved in half an ounce of pyrolig
neous or acetic acid; into the hot solution was dropped a spi
rituous solution of iodine (without iodide of potassium); as the
mixture cooled, these little gems gradually formed; they were
carefully separated on a filter, and again dissolved in acetic acid
by the aid of heat; a few drops of the tincture of iodine, as be
fore, added, and on cooling they were again deposited; a second
recrystallization removed       all

164           Dr. Herapath    on the Optical Properties of
   2nd.    It was found that by treating solutions of each alkaloid
in a precisely similar manner with iodine, crystals possessing
the peculiar properties were only produced in the solution of the
pure disulphate of quinine.
   The disulphate of cinchonine solution was merely slightly
reddened upon the addition of iodine; becoming turbid, a cin
namon-brown precipitate falling, which upon heating in contact
with the mother-liquid became indigo-coloured, and did not re
dissolve.     No crystals were produced.
   Therefore it became probable that iodine, sulphuric acid, and
quinine, were absolutely necessary for the production of these
crystals.
   1st. To decide the question whether the sulphuric acid was
absolutely essential, a portion of the crystals was dissolved in
acetic acid, and whilst hot, acetate of baryta was dropped in until
no further precipitation occurred; the solution was filtered whilst
hot, and upon cooling there was no appearance of any crystalli
zation after remaining several days.
   2nd. Another portion of these crystals was dissolved by boiling
 n rectified spirit; a sherry wine-coloured fluid resulted; it was
divided into two portions.
   (A.) The first was allowed to cool spontaneously; the crystals
were deposited again, but in rosettes, as before described.
   (B.) The second portion of the alcoholic solution was treated
whilst hot with acetate of baryta; the sulphate precipitated
directly; the supernatant fluid on cooling remained perfectly
transparent, and no crystals formed after some days.
   3rd. An alcoholic solution of the pure alkaloid quinine was
carefully prepared, and an alcoholic solution of iodine added; a
sherry wine-coloured fluid resulted; no crystals were deposited;
and upon spontaneous evaporation an ochry-yellow precipitate
remained, without crystalline form, and having a very resinous
appearance.
   Therefore it now became evident that iodine, sulphuric acid,
and quinine, were the constituent elements of this peculiar body.
How associated, it is difficult to say; but it is probable that
they are arranged as a binary compound, the disulphate of qui
mine acting as a feebly electro-positive base to the iodine as an
electro-negative.     It is conjectured therefore to be an iodide of
the  disulphate   of quinine.
   It now became an interesting question to decide whether any
other of the vegetable alkaloids would act in a similar manner
with iodine. The same experiments were tried with the salts of
morphine, brucine, strychnine, salicine and cinchonine, but with
out success; we may therefore almost confidently depend on the
production of these crystals being indicative of the presence of

                 a newly-discovered Salt    of Quinine.              165
quinine in a given solution.     It is to be regretted that the atomic
weight has not yet been determined, but hitherto time has not
permitted the necessary experiments to be undertaken.
   This substance presents itself under a variety of crystalline
forms; a slight change in the manner of producing them will
occasion an alteration in their shape. (See fig. 2.)
   When formed from a solution of the disulphates of quinine
and cinchonine in diluted sulphuric acid, they present the form of
parallelopipeds, exceedingly slender and elongated; the terminal
planes are rectangular, the thickness being scarcely appreciable,
even less than Tºrodth part of an inch, the breadth and length
being variable.
   The transition from this form to the square plate is very easy,
and frequently observed.
   By truncating the angles of the square plate we derive the
octagonal plate; very common.
   Under other circumstances, the aciculae change the form of
their terminal planes and become acutely pointed.
   By shortening the length and increasing the breadth we ob
tain the half hexagon.
   By joining two of these, base to base, we obtain the hexagonal
plate.   Very frequently found in crystals deposited from the
acetic acid solution.
                                                                       -
   The rhomboidal plate is a very common form.
   When a quantity of the disulphates is dissolved in acetic acid,
a very few drops of a spirituous solution of iodine employed (say
four or five), and the mixture left some hours in perfect repose to
cool and crystallize, very large broad plates are produced, appa
rently formed of many aciculae cohering by their elongated edges.
These plates, by very careful manipulation indeed, may be trans
ferred to a thin plate of microscopic glass and dried; when set up
in Canada balsam and properly mounted, this becomes available
as a polarizer; and in this way a crystal has been mounted by
the author, and adapted to his microscope in place of a tourma
line.   Frequently these crystals assume a form derived from the
cuboid plate, several of which joined edge to edge produce a
compound plate, the angles being at the same time more or less
truncated.
   Occasionally the constituent rhombic or square plates cohere
by their flat surfaces instead of by their edges. They are            all
arranged  by  the same optical plane; and are not merely superim
posed       in
           accident inthis peculiar position,   allthe crystals formed
in the solution  having  the same   extraordinary   shape.
   Under other circumstances we obtain this substance           in  the
form     most beautiful compound rosettes, the component crystal
         of
being either the minute hexagon       ora  form derived from it;      or

166                  Dr. Herapath      on the Optical Properties       of
the lozenge, like lithic acid.              The crystals deposited from alcohol
are of this character.
   At other           times     it forms small          of acicular
                                                 stellae,    composed
crystals radiating from a centre like the spokes of a wheel.
   A more cautious crystallization will produce short pyramids
like the ammoniaco-magnesian      phosphate from alkaline urine.
This is the case when a solid   plate of iodine is suspended in a
solution of the disulphates in acetic acid.   Some days elapse ere
they form, in consequence of the very slow solution of the iodine.
 (See fig. 2.)
    The primary form of these crystals appears to be derived from
the rhombic prism, but it is very possible that the substance may
be dimorphous.
    One remarkable fact is evident throughout the whole of this
 crystalline metamorphosis,    the optical properties remain the
 same; and the merest film of this remarkable substance possesses
 decided power over the rays of light.

object-glass and No. 2 eye-piece; a low power, certainly under
100 diameters.
   A. Their brilliant   emerald-green colour reflected to the eye
has been   already noticed.   This beam of green light produced
by reflexion is decidedly a polarized ray when the plane of the
crystal is inclined 41° to the plane of the incident ray.

ance when examined by transmitted light has also been noticed.

of these microscopically thin compound plates; the slightest
touch is sufficient to disrupt them.       The slightest movement
in the  liquid will at times destroy the connexion existing between
the edges   of the component   prisms;  they thus lose their uniform
and parallel arrangement.     Wherever they cross, polarization and
obstruction of the rays of light necessarily occur, and the plate
is of course useless for the purpose designed.
   But although it is not possible to obtain one large enough to
surmount the eye-piece, yet it is perfectly easy to procure plates
of sufficient size to act as analysing crystals upon the field or
stage of the instrument, of course used superimposed on the
tourmaline, or artificial tourmaline attached to the stage; and
when these are placed at right angles, the phaenomena of polari
zation may be exhibited with great splendour.   (Wide fig. 13.)
   When these crystals have been thus arranged, and the selenite
stage interposed, the field becomes coloured according to the
thickness of the plate of selenite ; and the extent of the field so
coloured will depend on the magnitude and breadth of the su
perior artificial tourmaline employed; frequently the whole field
of seven or eight inches, or even eleven inches in diameter, has
been coloured with an uniform tint.

pelled to return to my old method of experiment, applying at
the same time a more powerful apparatus.          Two flat spirals,
each of which consisted of 534 feet of copper wire wound into
31 coils, were set one after the other in a circuit which con
tained a sensitive air-thermometer. The combination of the
spirals with the battery and with each other was so arranged,
that the current could enter both at the same place (centre or
rim), or at different places; the directions of the current in the
spirals being in the former case alike, and in the latter case
opposite. The spirals were first placed at a distance of about
9 inches apart, and stood oblique to each other (the straight
line which joined their centres made an oblique angle with their
surfaces), and the following temperatures were observed.      The
balls of the unit-jar were   a line apart.   The temperature for
the unit of charge is the mean value of the constant a in the

176        Dr. Tyndall on                the Progress               of the Physical            Sciences:
of the current through both spirals were the same and when they
were opposite, compels the conclusion, that, in the position above
described, the wires exercise no influence upon each other, which
result was indeed anticipated. The spirals were now set nor
mally opposite, and brought within a line of each other.     In the
following experiments the combinations of the spirals were essen
tially the same as in the former; the observations differing merely
therein, that for the first vertical column, under the head ‘Tem
perature,” the thermometer stood nearest to the inner coating of
the battery, while for the second column the spirals were nearest
to the same coating.

be entirely neglected.   To place the fact beyond doubt, we see
that it is necessary to place 107 feet of a current 119 feet in
length within a line of each other, by winding them into two
spirals, the most distant parts of each of these being not more
than a foot apart. In the wire screws, used so frequently in the
circuit for the sake of sparing room, the distance between two
windings is much less than the diameter of the screw; hence a
wire wound into this form must, as in the case of the N wire,
principally weaken the current.
   In the series of experiments given above, the spirals were
united by a copper wire 29 inches long and ºths of a line in
thickness. The measured currents bore nearly the following
proportions to each other:-
Without the action   Current in same direction.                   Current in opposite directions.

The connecting wire was exchanged for one of 39% inches in
length and ºth of a line thick. Out of twenty-seven observa
tions, the following numbers were found                                       for

The phaenomenon      therefore independent
                                   is          the retarding value     of

                     these cases the increase   the current    less                                is

an accidental          circumstance.
   The result established may        thus expressed:—  be
   Two   portions      the         of

closely parallel, act upon each other.   The current will   weakened                      be
 by this action when       two parallel portions move
                                         its                the same                     in
direction, and strengthened when they move                            in    opposite directions.

   The dependence of the principal current on the shape of the
wire through which it passes, or in other words, the action of
the current upon itself, has been already demonstrated.        This
action is exhibited in a more striking degree by the secondary
current.   A small induction-disc was introduced into the pri
mary circuit, and a corresponding one into the secondary circuit;
the remaining portion of the secondary circuit              of 44.7
feet of copper wire ºths of a line in thickness, and the wire of
the thermometer.     The 447 feet of copper wire were first so
stretched  out, that when a secondary current passed through it
the action of one portion of it upon another was null, and the
strength of the secondary current under these circumstances was
measured.     The same wire was then wound into a spiral shape,
the form alone of the circuit being thus altered,        length re                                            its

weakened by the N-form and strengthened by the U-form thereof;
and the same is true of currents of all other orders.
   With regard to the directions of these currents much uncer
tainty exists; Henry, Matteucci, Verdet and Knochenhauer have
given utterance to various and contradictory opinions on this
subject. With admirable ingenuity M. Riess has brought the
foregoing experiments to bear upon this point. Let us suppose
an induction-disc to be placed in the primary circuit, and
parallel to it another with                          its
                                     ends united, thus forming          iso                                     an
lated circuit      itself. The passage
                     in                            current through the   of   a
former will arouse             an
                          induced current possessing        certain direc                 a

                                    to         coincident with       or the                              it,    in
latter. Without altering the relative position              the discs,                    of                          let

have among themselves one and the same direction.
   With regard to the direction of the currents of even orders as
compared with that of the primary current, the author arrives
at the probable conclusion, that they also have the same direc

hypothetical, we will content ourselves with the mere indication
of the author’s opinion.

          GENTLEMEN,                                          Liverpool, Feb. 10, 1852.
         SHOULD    be glad to be allowed to avail myself of the me
       dium of   your  Journal to give a brief notice of some thermo
                                           I
electrical experiments which made in the years 1842 and 18.13+,
and which I believe may be of service in elucidating some of the
results noted in your February Number in Dr. Tyndall's inter
esting review of Professor Magnus's researches on this subject.
   Where thermo-electrical couples are formed of feebly thermo
electric agents, such as bars of the same metal in different states
of density, particularly of the softer malleable metals, the elec
trical force developed is so weak, that slight changes in the mode
of manipulation, or small differences in the clements employed,
which are either unknown to the operator or are generated
during his experiment, will produce contradictory results.           On
which account it appears to me to be better to leave that class of
agents and first study the production of thermo-electricity by
metals, where the force is so decided, that, in the hands of dif
ferent experimenters, uniform actions can be obtained.
    Steel is a substance possessed of the advantage of being readily
changed in density in opposite directions by two modes of hard
ening; and as these different methods are accompanied by a
thermo-electrical current governed in                   its
                                                 direction      the kind       by
    hardening employed, the experiments with steel appear

Again, with a bar of soft steel, and a similar bar made hard and
light by the well-known process of heating and immersing in cold
water, the thermo-electric action in this arrangement is from the
hard and light part to the soft and more dense portion of the
metal; in this respect differing from the first couple, where the
current passed to the denser side of the two pieces of metal,   A
couple formed of hard and soft steel elements affords another
 good proof of the influence of the molecular state of a bar over
the thermo-electrical currents generated by the unequal heating
                                                                                           of by

    The metals bismuth and antimony occupy                       thermo-electric      in

Assume

  We must make
              D"+k=(D+k)(D+k)....                      (D+km),

                    w=    Da   +A(D)=a D+1+X(D).
Therefore by suitably changing the form of A(D) we can perform
the operations.
   As another example          I

differences   of age or sex, or to some change in the health of the
animal.      I was  therefore led to make new observations in refer
ence to these probabilities, and to observe the phaenomena with
additional attention when the structure differed from that which
was most common.           In these observations      I  sometimes noticed
in the dark or neutral line, which separated two positive struc
tures, something like a trace of an intervening structure, which
was either about to disappear, or about to be developed.                This
conjecture was confirmed by observations on the lenses of a cow
eleven years old.
    The lenses, after being carefully taken out, were freed from
the adhering portions of the vitreous humour by the gentle ap
plication of blotting-paper, so as not to disturb their internal
structure. The lenses were elliptical. Their longest diameter
was 0.774 inch, their shortest diameter 0-747 inch, and their
thickness 0.513 of an inch. The first lens which exposed to    I
polarized light was in the highest perfection, and the symmetry
of the optical figure unusually beautiful. I have represented it
in Plate V. fig. 1, in which only two structures, or two series of
positive sectors, are visible+.       The lens was now a day old, and
there seemed to be a faint      light  within the two black rings, espe
cially in the outer one, which was either the remains of an old,
or the germ of a new structure.          If this were the case, then the
anomalous combination of two          positive structures would be con
verted into a combination of four structures, in which a negative
and a positive one alternated.
    On the following day I prepared the other lens with the same
care, and found my conjecture completely verified.            In the middle
black ring, which was distinctly brownish in the first lens, the
negative structure had evidently commenced at one part, and
the colour of the whole ring was a brighter brown than in the
first lens.    In the outer black ring another negative structure
had also appeared, and had advanced considerably upon the
positive structure. These phaenomena              I  have represented in
fig. 2, where the four structures are distinctly seen, the second
   * Upon referring to my earlier observations,     I  find that in both the
lenses of an ox there was only one structure which was a positive one, and
which had not yet divided itself into two structures, as in that of the cow
under consideration.     There was the appearance of a black space near the
margin of the lens, but the polarized light both within and without that
black ring was positive.
   In the lens of another ox, and of a bull, I found the positive structure
separated into two positive structures by a distinct black ring, while an ex
ternal negative structure was clearly developed.

194     Sir David Brewster on the Changes in the Structure
being a faint blue of the first order. On the third day the two
new structures had become more prominent.            The structure
No. 2, now a pale white of the first order, was completely deve
loped, having encroached upon and almost obliterated the third
structure. The structure No. 4, which was not in existence on
the first day, had now the maximum tint, namely a bright white
of the first order.  On the fourth day the structures No. 2 and
4, which at first were not in existence, are now the structures
with the maximum tints, and No. 3, which had the maximum
tint, is now almost obliterated, a little faint brown light remain
ing in one of the quadrants.
   On the fifth day the four sectors of the inner structure No. 1
have almost disappeared.     No. 3 has disappeared entirely, and
No. 2, which is almost the only polarizing structure, exhibits a
more intense white of the first order than appeared in any part
of the lens. The ring No. 2 divides the radius of the lens
equally.
   On the sixth day the structure No. 2 was still bright and uni
form, but the polarized light had disappeared from every other
part of the lens.
  On the seventh day the lens, which was always placed in water,
burst  itscapsule, and there was                no   longer any trace                 of   distinct
polarizing structures.

Both the lenses    ofthe cow exhibited when taken out         the eye                 of
four beautiful structures,        which the positive and negative
                                       in
structures alternate.    The first and fourth were very faint, being
the  palest white      of
                      the first order.   The third was also faint, but

The lenses were still transparent, and the tint of the structure
No. 2 had risen to an orange-red of the first order.
   Having experienced great difficulty in the course of the pre
ceding experiments in preserving the capsule of the lens trans
parent for several days, I made trial of various fluids, but found
distilled water more suited to my purpose than any other.                                 I
therefore began a regular course of observations on the crystalline
lens of the sheep when placed in distilled water, which have -
afforded me very satisfactory results.
   The lens of a sheep a year and a quarter old, when newly
taken out of the eye, exhibited in the distinctest manner only
one structure, with slight traces of an external one.  This struc
ture was positive, and occupied almost the whole of the lens, as
shown in fig. 3. The traces of an external structure, when
carefully examined, showed it to be negative.     On the following
day this lens burst in the direction of the three septa.
   In the lenses of another sheep I found two structures like the
preceding, but with this difference, that the external negative
structure was more developed, as in fig. 4. On the following
day this negative structure had extended itself inwards, but in
consequence of an accident the lenses burst their capsule.
   In the lenses of another Cheviot sheep, where the external
negative structure had just begun to appear, the wide positive
structure shown in fig. 3 had just begun to separate itself by a
dark neutral line, which was seen only in one of     four sectors,       its
and which divided that sector into two.
    In another Cheviot sheep the principal positive structure had
distinctly divided itself into two positive structures, separated                         by
a dark neutral ring,       shown as fig.     The same appearance
                                                in    5.

                the other  lens; and have found  I     very common  it

196      Sir. David Brewster         on the Changes          in   the   Structure
stinctly formed black rings from the two positive structures,
between which it lies. This state of the polarizing structure is
shown in fig. 6, which is nearly the same as in the lens of the
COW.
    The structure No. 1, beginning at the centre, was pretty
 bright, but No. 3 was much more so, and No. 4 very faint,
 though perfectly distinct.
    On the second day the blue ring No. 2 was much enlarged,
 and had encroached greatly on the brightest structure No. 3,
 having reduced it both in breadth and intensity.         No. 4 has
 also extended itself at the expense of No. 3.
    On the third day the new structure No. 2 had become the
brightest of all. No. 4 had increased also, whilst No. 1 had
become smaller and fainter, and No. 3 was wholly obliterated.
    In another pair of lenses one of them burst at this stage of
the development of the polarizing structures, while in the other
the effect was singularly fine. No. 3 was wholly, and No. 1
nearly obliterated; while the two new structures, which had no
existence at first, were the only ones that remained.       The new
negative structure No. 2 consisted of four beautiful blue sectors
of polarized light; but in consequence of the great absorption
of distilled water, and the consequent distension of the lens, it
soon burst.
   I  have already remarked that only one case has occurred in
the course of my experiments in which the central structure of
the lenses of quadrupeds was negative, as in fishes.    In this case,
however, the centre of the lens had           its
                                         structure affected    some           by
change   in the condition     of

septa, which were not only distinctly seen, but had the polarizing
structure clearly related     to
                              them.   The polarized light filled                       up
each    ofthe three angles       120° which lay between the three
                                 of
septa, and the intensity     the light was
                              of              maximum close

                        it

septa, and had obliterated the positive structure which would
otherwise    have existed there.
   In  examining the lenses    the horse, have observed the pro

had examined, were positive, the next structure negative, and the-
external one positive.
   In the lens of another horse, whose age was also unknown to
me, the remains of three structures were visible; but the two
positive ones, namely, the central and external                           structures, had
just disappeared, but were not encroached upon by the interme
diate negative one. They were therefore black when seen by
polarized light, as shown in fig. 7, while the remaining negatire
one was of the most brilliant yellow colour.
   In the lenses of a third horse, probably of an intermediate
age, I found a structure intermediate between that of the two
preceding ones.      The following were the dimensions of                                        its

  On the fourth day the yellow ring had risen to a pale pink of
the first order, and the outer ring was negative, as on the pre
ceding day.
    On the fifth day the pink ring had increased in intensity, and
the other structures remained the same as before.
    On the sirth day the pink had risen to a very bright blue. The
diameter of the lens was now 0-867 of an inch, and its thickness
0.733, being an increase of 0.233 of an inch in thickness.
    On the seventh day the capsule burst, and upon removing it
 and the soft pulp which formed about one-tenth of an inch of
 the outer margin of the lens, the pink ring, with the white band

thus venturing to dissent from universally accredited opinions:
I shall therefore enter into a critical examination of the chief
arguments which have been made use of to establish the alleged
                                          I
identity. In doing so, shall take occasion to refer to the expla
nations of these phaenomena suggested by the views developed
in the preceding pages of this essay, relative to the presumed
compound nature of the electric fluid which with this object                                                     I
stated in the commencement.
  Professor Faraday informs us, that at the period when he un
dertook the investigation of the agent concerned in these phae
nomena, the question of identity was as yet undecided.      He
says,   “Notwithstanding, therefore,                                the general            impression           of
the identity of electricities, it is evident that the proofs have
not been sufficiently clear and distinct to obtain assent of                                                    all
those who were competent          consider the subject:” hence his

investigations rendered        necessary for him

strong impression that the identity, far from being established,
was rendered more problematical                                by
                                          every newly-discovered fact

            the first place, necessary
                   in                     understand precisely what     to

              these terms   quantity and  intensity; they have been
always used       explaining the difference between frictional and
                            in

his views,       therefore necessary
                       it   is             inquire what the “ordinary

25° 45'; and the needle remained stationary at this degree when
the wheel was made to revolve at any greater velocity. Now the
sine of 25° 45' is half that of 60°. When the ratio of surface of
the brass and wooden teeth was different from that above men
tioned, the results corresponded.     M. Pouillet says in conclu
sion, “hence it finally results that the quantity of electricity
which constitutes the current is proportionate to the intensity
of this current: also the intensity may be taken for the measure
 of the quantities of electricity +.”
  If   it be admitted that intensity is the measure of quantity,
 and that one must be in the direct ratio of the other, it would
 appear that a “great quantity at a low intensity” cannot exist
 in a current, always including in the word “current” the di
 mensions of the wire in which the electricity flows. The expres
 sion seems to  imply  a contradiction in terms.
   Suppose     that the coil of a galvanometer is the surface over

off without increasing the intensity, it would be proper to con
sider the following facts. It is a part of the voltaic hypothesis
that frictional electricity is the electric fluid existing in small
quantity at a high intensity.             If a very thin wire, such as is
used for    forming    the coil of a  galvanometer,     be made the medium
of communication between the positive and negative conductors
of a large and powerful electric machine, it will be found on
turning the cylinder that a pair of pith balls, hung by wet
threads from the conductor, will diverge with energy.                      This
proves, that small as the quantity of electricity present is sup
posed to be, the thin wire is incapable of conducting the whole
of      it,

the thinnest foil, exposed a surface of only one-hundredth of a
square inch. The platinum plate was immersed in a mixture of
equal parts of nitric acid and water; the zinc was then intro
duced, when instantly the needle whirled round the circle com
pletely. In order to estimate what was the equivalent of the
voltaic power that produced this effect, I arranged a couronne des
tasses of twenty pairs of copper and zinc plates, each three
quarters of a square inch in surface, the exciting liquid being
dilute sulphuric acid.   The polar wires were connected with an
electrometer, consisting of two gold leaves detached and insu
lated from each other, and so contrived that they could be
made to recede or approach.      By causing the gold leaves con
nected with the polar wires to approach very gradually, it was
found that when they were within about one-tenth of an inch of
each other, an attraction was observable. Each gold-leaf proved
by calculation to weigh one-fiftieth of a grain; consequently
each was 3000 times lighter than the galvanometer needle. The
couronne des tasses produced       electrical effects  its

 These things occurred         England when the value
                                      in                     these substances       of

 notice. To one of these we will confine ourselves:—“I have known,”
 says Mr. Smyth, “zinc blende taken for lead ore, and honoured with
 the erection of a smelting furnace, when to the chagrin of the
 manager the volatile metal flew away up the chimney, leaving only
 disappointment and loss behind.           Again, from a faint resemblance
 which some of the varieties bear to certain iron ores, a resemblance
 which would at once disappear before accurate observation, a consi
 derable quantity was bought not long since by one of the greatest
 iron-masters in this country.       It was carried to the furnaces, duly
 mingled with fuel and flux, and after a strenuous effort had been
 made to get it to yield iron, it all, as the proprietor naively re
 marked, ‘went off in smoke.’”
     But a matter of far more importance than the correction of isolated
  mistakes is the investigation of the principles which regulate the
 accumulation of ore in metalliferous veins,—a subject so enveloped
 in mystery, that our present mining enterprises are almost as much
 a matter of chance as such enterprises were three centuries ago.
 “Copious stores of knowledge have, it is true, been acquired by
 many of the captains and tributers in Cornwall and elsewhere; but
 besides the difficulty, according to the various views of individuals,
 in collating them, they have generally, for want of early educational
 opportunity, been accumulated upon an unsafe basis; and finally, the
 experiences perish with the men, leaving society no richer for their
 acquisition.”
     Referring to the vast mineral resources of Great Britain, and the
 multitude which derive employment and support from this source,
 the lecturer earnestly proceeds: “Let us then consider the great
 population supported directly by the extraction of these minerals,
 and indirectly by their application to the arts—the maintenance of
 hundreds of thousands of men by these not inexhaustible stores, and
 the entire dependence of our whole manufacturing and commercial
 system on the supply of fossil fuel; and we cannot fail to arrive at
 the conviction, that in exercising the stewardship of such gifts of
 Heaven the nation has a high and responsible duty to perform, that
 waste and improvidence are a national sin, and that it behoves all
 who are in any way connected with the working of our mines to lend
 their best endeavours to the perfecting of the most oeconomical and
 efficacious means of rendering           all
                                         the products     of
                                                         our mines available
 to the uses of mankind.”
    Among the methods employed for ascertaining the existence             use of
ful deposits, the lecturer refers         some length
                                          at              to

resources is reduced to something nearer equality, when deeper and
thinner coal-seams must be wrought, when poorer ores of the metals
must be more highly prized, and when the products of our manufac
tures can only be brought into commerce at higher prices, then must
the star of England's prosperity decline, unless we keep our vantage
ground by the superior skill and knowledge to which technical edu
cation must greatly contribute.”
   Following the lectures in the order in which we accidentally
perused them, the lecture of Mr. Ramsay next presents itself.        He
refers in his introduction to the resistance offered to the earlier ad
vances of geological inquiry. “Geology was not so fortunate as
chemistry, when princes vied with each other in the encouragement
of alchemical discovery. There was no heresy in the transmutation
of the baser metals into gold. Geology, on the contrary, was for a
long time generally esteemed a pestilent heresy; and though         cul                            its
tivators escaped the prison, yet even     our day few angry men are
                                                        in               a
not wanting, who, steeped         ignorance
                                         in        mistaken zeal, still
                                                                   or   a
re-echo the time-worn cry.”
   The lecturer arranges his subject under two principal heads—
Physical Geography and Palaeontology; the former dealing with the
nature and modes         of formation       rocks, and the latter with the
                                               of
organic forms which they contain.           The beautiful investigations

inductive reasoning.”         To William Smith, however, the lecturer
considers “that we owe the first clear enunciation of the law of the
stratigraphical succession         species—a law alike great
                                    of                              theoretical        in

gratulated on the amount of highmindedness, vigour, and ability
which has been enlisted in its cause.        Here and there the private
hope and aspiration of the lecturer crops out, and it is always a
noble hope and aspiration.      We have in the majority of cases the
express qualities necessary to the founders of a new institution—
earnestness and enthusiasm, united to intellectual power sufficient to
control and regulate both.
    The author proceeds to consider the results and bearings of the
law of superposition, and the absurd and ruinous speculations which
have flowed from ignorance of that law. “At the very moment I
 now write I have received a letter from Mr. Aveline, one of the
geologists of the Survey, in which he says, “I have a narrow slip of
 coal-measures running between the Permian and the new red beds,
 and the old red sandstone that you saw at Bewdley. A person found
 out the only place where the coal is well shown, and sunk a pit;
 but finding the coal worthless, he has gone a little way off on the old
 red sandstone, where he is sinking after the most approved manner,
 bricking his shaft round.' Near Trefgarn, Caermarthen,” &c., pro
ceeds the lecturer, “the black slates are dotted with shafts, borings,
 and levels, sunk or driven in delusive searches for coal. While in
progress, the cry still is ‘the indications are good, go a little deeper;’
 and the pit, the disappointment, and the ruin often deepen together,
 till, abandoned in despair, the speculator is left to console himself
with the parting assurance, ‘We are not to blame, had you only
gone a little deeper.' Long after, when the wandering geologist
visits such spots, he is informed that the miners actually found coal,
but were bribed to hush it up by the coal-owners, jealous of their
markets.”
    To Professor Ramsay's condemnation of exaggerated vertical sec
tions we see no reason to subscribe.         No man of any experience
could, we imagine, be misled in this way.            In the exaggerated
section we are not    required   to trust our  eyes,  but can obtain, by
direct measurement with the      scale, the precise thickness of the seam
of coal. In the natural section we doubt whether this precision is
possible; the thickness of the finest line would, we imagine, amount
to some feet; and thus, though the eye may be furnished with a
correct general impression, accurate measurement appears to be out
of the question.
    We shall here transcribe Professor Ramsay's interesting account
of the artesian well at Grenelle near Paris. “The nature of the
artesian wells is simple.    If I take a bent tube and pour therein any
quantity of water, it will maintain a corresponding level on either
side; and if I insert another tube shorter than the curved arms (we
shall suppose at the lowest point of the curve), then by virtue of a
law of hydrostatic pressure the water will rise in the inserted tube,
an equal amount being displaced in the curved arms on either side.
There it will rest. But if a constant supply be yielded to one or
both of the openings of the curved reservoir, then the water will
overflow at the mouth of the central inserted tube, which thus repre
sents the boring of an artesian well.

  his convictions, and endeavours, as far as in him lies, to enact them
  practically, he has a claim to the respect of every lover of straight
  forwardness. Men, however, who take this view of things, are rarely
  slow to affirm that it is the only view; which affirmation carries them
  all unconsciously from the region of fact into that of fallacy. The
  greatest mistakes of individuals, the bigotry of sects, and the ani
  mosity of rival theorists, are to be traced to one-sidedness, to the
  putting of a part for the whole, to looking at an object from one
  point of view, and denying that it possesses any other phase or cha
  racter than that which they discern from this point. Now that the
  body must be clothed and nurtured is a physiological axiom which
  nobody will feel inclined to dispute; and as this is done through
  the instrumentality of pounds, shillings and pence, such considera
 tions appear to be perfectly justifiable as incentives to exertion and
 improvement.      But we sincerely believe that the man whose theory
 of human culture rises no higher than this, will prove defective even
  as a practical man. It is not the love of gain, but the love of truth,
 as incidentally remarked by Mr. Ramsay, which has produced our
 greatest practical results.     Most heartily do we sympathize with
 those outbursts of a    higher faith which shine like sunbeams here and
 there through the discourses of most of the professors of the School
 of Mines. They are not the outbursts of a vain enthusiasm, but
 the aspirations of men who have encountered the difficulties of cul
 ture and tasted of its sweets; and even should circumstances render
 it necessary on their part to observe an extreme frugality in the
 enunciation of these higher principles, our hope is that they will not
 suffer them to decay; and that even among their most practical
 hearers, to borrow the concluding words of Mr. Smyth, there may
 be some few who will not stop short at that point whence they may
 obtain their worldly ends, but will persevere towards that goal of
 higher knowledge which has been, and always will be, the object of
 the noblest of mankind.
 Optical Investigations occasioned by the Total Eclipse of the Sun on
    the 28th of July 1851. By Dr. v. FEILITzsch.        Greifswald, 1852:
    Th. Kunike.
    The author was one of the numerous band of observers who planted
themselves within the moon's shadow upon the day above mentioned.
His place of observation was Karlskrona in Sweden. He traces the
doubt and mystery which have hitherto enveloped the phaenomena
attendant upon solar eclipses to the fact, that they were observed
solely by astronomers, and not by physicists.        This remark appears
to be   scarcely applicable   where such men as Professor Airy are con

cerned.    Surely the man whose investigations on optics have won
him such high renown is not likely to fall into the error of regarding
the phaenomena in question as lying beyond the limits of physical
explanation, or of forgetting the possible influence of diffraction and
interference in their production.
   Grounding his views on the theory of undulation, the aim of the
author is to show that the corona, the coloured light, and the red
projections from the moon's rim during a solar eclipse, are                 the                          all

   The coloured light observed during the total eclipse               the light                    is

the beginning.      Hence indeed the name “elliptic functions,” de
rived from a part, was given to the whole.      Here then the question
naturally arose: What geometrical types did the first and third
orders represent?     This question long remained without complete
solution; and investigators in this department of analysis were
compelled to take the fundamental expressions as arbitrary data,
and to forgo the inquiry what the geometrical theorems were
which these algebraical expressions represented. Various but un
successful attempts were made by geometers to represent them by
quadratures, or by plane curves, either algebraical or transcendental.
About ten years ago, however, Messrs. Guderman and Catalan
showed that the circular form of the third order represented the
curve of intersection of a cone of the second degree and a concentric
sphere; but they did not extend their researches to the first order,
nor to the logarithmic form of the third.
   The main object of the paper is to prove that elliptic integrals
of every kind, the parameter taking any value whatever between
positive and negative infinity, represent the intersections of surfaces
of the second order.
   These surfaces divide themselves into two classes, of which the
sphere and the paraboloid are the respective types; from the former
arise the circular functions of the third order, from the other the
logarithmic and exponential.     In the course of these investigations
it is shown that the formulae for the comparison of elliptic integrals,
which are given by Legendre, follow simply as geometrical inferences
from the fundamental properties of those curves. The ordinary
conic sections are merely particular cases of those more general
curves, to which the author has given the name Hyperconic Sections.
   The author remarks, that it will doubtless appear not a little sin
gular, that the principal properties of these functions, their classi
fication, their transformations, the comparison of elliptic integrals of
the third order, with conjugate or reciprocal parameters, were all
investigated and developed before geometers had any idea of the true
geometrical origin of those functions.      It is as if the formulae of
common trigonometry had been derived from an algebraical defini
tion, before the geometrical conception of the circle had been ad
mitted.     As trigonometry may be defined, the development of the
properties of circular arcs, whether described on a plane, or on the
surface of a sphere, so this higher trigonometry, or the theory of
elliptic integrals, may be defined as the development of the rela
tions which exist between the arcs of hyperconic sections.
   It may be said, we cannot by this method derive any properties
of elliptic integrals which may not algebraically be deduced from the
fundamental expressions appropriately assumed.         It cannot, how
ever, be truly asserted that the properties of curve lines should be
developed without any reference to their geometrical types.          We
might, starting from certain algebraical expressions, derive every
known property of curve lines, without having in any instance a
conception of the geometrical types which they represent.           The
theory of elliptic integrals was developed by a method the inverse
of that pursued in establishing the formulae of common trigonometry.

    5. Basic chloride, in microscopic crystals, disseminated here and
there throughout the whole product.
    6. Sulphuret of copper, black, without any appearance of cry
stallization.
    The whole of these substances covering the piece of galena, gave
it the appearance of a specimen from a mineral vein.
    In some of the vessels there were formed only chloride and chloro
sulphate of lead, in others chloride and sulphate, which depended no
doubt upon the proportions of the sulphate of copper and of chloride
of sodium, and the density of the solutions. A voltaic couple, formed
of a piece of galena surrounded by a platinum wire, placed in a satu
rated solution of common salt and sulphate of copper diluted with
3 vols. of water, gave rise to the formation of a considerable quan
tity of crystallized chloride of lead in cubes, without any other pro
duct; they were similarly deposited, though a little larger, upon a
fragment of malachite which was placed in the solution.
    There is no evidence in opposition to the opinion that these reac
tions take place in nature.     In fact, the pluvial waters which reach
 the mineral masses and veins, formed of metallic combinations, be
come charged with chloride of sodium and sulphate of copper, arising
from the decomposition of the cupreous pyrites; the resulting solu
 tions, once in contact with the galena, react upon it weakly, and
 give rise to the various compounds described above.
    Two other compounds have been obtained, PbO,CO2 and CaO, CO2,
by the following processes:—Into a saturated solution of carbonate
 of soda and carbonate of copper was introduced a plate of lead, 4 cen
 tims. by 2, surrounded by a platinum wire, the whole placed in a glass
vessel imperfectly closed, and left to spontaneous action for seven years.
 The lead gradually oxidized at the expense of the atmosphere; the
 oxide formed, slightly soluble in water, reacted upon the carbonate
 of copper, whence resulted hydrated oxide of copper and carbonate
 of lead (PbO, CO"). This was in very small crystals, covering the
plate of lead, and their form appeared the same as the natural car
 bonate. The carbonate of lime was obtained by effecting the de
 composition of the sulphate of that base, a salt slightly soluble in
 water, and naturally abundant, by a solution of bicarbonate of soda,
 a compound found in several mineral waters. A plate of Montmartre
 gypsum was introduced into the solution (saturated or not) of the latter
 salt; it soon lost its vitreous brilliancy, and was covered with small
 rhombohedrons of carbonate of lime.         At the moment of contact,
 the gypsum dissolved, and reacted immediately upon the bicarbonate
 of soda. There was a separation of carbonic acid, which partly re
 mained in the solution on account of imperfect closeness of the
 vessel. The formation of sulphate of soda and carbonate of lime in
 such a way that the plates which successively separated from the
 gypsum were formed of small attached rhombohedrons, cannot be
 supposed as solely owing to a double decomposition.        It is probable
that the dissolving action of the carbonic acid plays a part in the
phaenomenon. These effects always present themselves with weak
solutions of bicarbonate.
    These facts prove two principles, by the aid of which a certain

number of insoluble crystalline compounds may be produced similar
 to the natural ones. The first consists in slowly oxidizing a body
in a solution of substances, upon which the oxide formed reacts,
and whence result oxides and various crystallized insoluble com.
pounds.    The second relates to the feeble reactions which take place
when a slightly soluble body is placed in contact with a solution
containing several compounds, giving rise to double decomposition,
in which case insoluble compounds are formed, which crystallize—

    Important as was the discovery by Sir Humphry Davy, of the
property possessed by thin wire-gauze to prevent the passage of
flame, yet it could hardly be expected that the details of any arrange

Attempts to improve the structure of the original Davy lamp have,
therefore, been numerous; but few of them have been generally
adopted; and in most of our collieries the original form of lamp is
still used.
    The principal defects of the common Davy lamp are, first, defi

prevents the passage of an explosive atmosphere into the lamp by
any current of air; no swinging of the lamp causes any action on
the flame; and no blower of gas can blow into the flame, in conse

of the heating to redness of the wire-gauze, is entirely removed.

A A'  are two plane mirrors, about four inches square, inserted in
frames, and so adjusted that their backs form an angle of 90°
with each other; these mirrors are fixed by their common edge
against an upright B, or which was less easy to represent in the
drawing, against the middle line of a vertical board, cut away in
such manner as to allow the eyes to be placed before the two
mirrors.    C C are two sliding boards, to which are attached the
upright boards D D', which may thus be removed to different
distances from the mirrors.    In most of the experiments here
after to be detailed, it is necessary that each upright board shall
be at the same distance from the mirror which is opposite to                                                       it.

   A few pairs of outline figures, calculated to give rise to the

stereoscope in the manner described, are represented in Pl.                           VIII.

actually employed.      As the drawings are reversed by reflexion in
the  mirrors, I will suppose   these figures to be the reflected images
to which the   eyes   are directed in the apparatus; those marked
b being seen by the right eye, and those marked a by the left
eye.   The drawings, it has been already explained, are two dif
ferent projections of the same object seen from two points of
sight, the distance between which is equal to the interval be
tween the eyes of the observer; this interval is generally about
2%   inches.

louring may properly be employed to heighten the effects. Care
ful attention would enable an artist to draw and paint the two
component pictures, so as to present to the mind of the observer,
in the resultant perception, perfect identity with the object re
  resented. Flowers, crystals, busts, vases, instruments of various
  inds, &c., might thus be represented so as not to be distin
guished by sight from the real objects themselves.
    It is worthy of remark, that the process by which we thus be
come acquainted with the real forms of solid objects, is precisely
that which is employed in descriptive geometry, an important
science we owe to the genius of Monge, but which is little studied
or known in this country.           In this science, the position of a
point, a right line or a curve, and consequently of any figure
whatever, is completely determined by assigning                 projections                  its
on   two fixed    planes,   the situations        which are    known,  of

   Dr. Smith * was very much puzzled by an effect of binocular
perspective which he observed, but was unable to explain.      He
opened a pair               of compasses, and while he held the joint in his
hand, and the points outwards and equidistant from his eyes,
and somewhat higher than the joint, he looked at a more distant
point; the compasses appeared double.         He then compressed
the legs until the two inner points coincided ; having done this
the two inner legs also entirely coincided, and bisected the angle
formed by the outward ones, appearing longer and thicker than
they did, and reaching from the hand to the remotest object in
view.   The explanation offered by Dr. Smith accounts only for
the coincidence of the points of the compasses, not for that of
the entire leg. The effect in question is best seen by employing
a pair of straight wires, about a foot in length.  A similar obser
vation, made with two flat rulers, and afterwards with silk threads,
induced Dr. Wells to propose a new theory of visible direction in
order to explain                it,

 two retinae are then exactly similar, and the mind appreciates no
 difference whether two identical pictures fall on corresponding

more readily the object itself than the drawing of it; for we are
accustomed to see real objects in almost every point of view, but
perspective representations being generally made in a vertical
plane with the point of sight in a line perpendicular to the plane
of projection, we are less familiar with the appearance of other
projections.         Any other unusual projection will produce the

forward, which effect gives to the whole solid a quite contrary
apparent inclination.”
   Professor Necker attributes this alteration of appearance, not
to a mental operation, but to an involuntary change in the ad
justment of the eye for obtaining distinct vision.    He supposed
that whenever the point of distinct vision on the retina is directed
on the angle A, for instance, this angle seen more distinctly than
the others, is naturally supposed to be nearer and foremost,
while the other angles seen indistinctly are supposed to be
further and behind, and that the reverse takes place when the
point of distinct vision is brought to bear on the angle X.
   That this is not the true explanation, is evident from three
circumstances : in the first place, the two points A and X
being both at the same distance from the eyes, the same altera
tion of adjustment which would make one of them indistinct
would make the other so; secondly, the figure will undergo
the same changes whether the focal distance of the eye be ad
justed to a point before or beyond the plane in which the figure
is drawn; and thirdly, the change of figure frequently occurs
while the eye continues to look at the same angle.                The effect
 seems entirely to depend on our mental contemplation of the
figure intended to be represented, or of                converse.    By fol
                                                                         its

I  have before observed, these effects are far more obvious when
the figures are regarded with one eye only.

objects in relief are regarded with a single eye. The apparent
conversion of a cameo into an intaglio, and of an intaglio into a
cameo, is a well-known instance of this fallacy in vision; but
the fact does not appear to me to have been correctly explained,
nor the conditions under which it occurs to have been properly
stated.
  This curious illusion, which has been the subject of much at
tention, was first observed at one of the early meetings of the
Royal Society 4. Several of the members looking through a
compound microscope of a new construction at a guinea, some
of them imagined the image to be depressed, while others
thought it to be embossed, as it really was. Professor Gmelin,
of Wurtemburg, published a paper on the same subject in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1745; his experiments were made
with telescopes and compound microscopes which inverted the
images; and he observed that the conversion of relief appeared
in some cases and not in others, at some times and not at others,
and to some eyes also and not to others.                  He endeavoured to
ascertain some of the conditions of the two appearances; “but
why these things should so happen,” says he,                   do not pretend            “I
to determine.”
    Sir David Brewster accounts for the fallacy in the following
manner f:—“A hollow seal being illuminated by a window or a
            If its
candle,         shaded side            course   is        of
                                                     the same side with the   on
light.         we now invert the seal with one                more lenses,            or                       so
that   itmay look         the opposite direction,
                                     in                    will appear     the      it                to
eye with the shaded side furthest from the window.                   But    we                            as
know that the window               still      our left
                                                 is      hand,   andon   every                       as
                     a or its
body with          shaded side furthest from the light must necessarily
  be convex        protuberant,                           we
                                      immediately believe that the hollow
seal   isnow       cameo       bas-relief. or  The proof which the eye thus
receives       ofthe seal   being   raised,   overcomes the evidence                                      of   its
 being hollow, derived from our actual knowledge and from the
 sense    of touch.                   In
                             this experiment the deception takes place
 from our     knowing     the real direction         the light which falls     of                              on
 the   seal;   for     the   place
                                if        the  window,     of

  could not have taken place.            The illusion, therefore, under our
  consideration        the result
                                is            operation    of our own minds,
                                                                 an                      of

     These considerations do not fully explain the phaenomenon,
  for they suppose that the image must be inverted, and that the
 light must fall in a particular direction; but the conversion of
  relief will still take place when the object is viewed through an
  open tube without any lenses to invert           and also when                       it,                               it     is

I    have given ample proof that objects whose pictures     not                                            do

single.     will now adduce
            I                   experiment which proves that
similar pictures falling               on
                            corresponding points                                         of    the two            re
tinae may  appear  double and    different places.

   Present,    the stereoscope,

vertical line exactly corresponding           position and length         that                          to a
presented         to
                 the  right  eye, and                 let
                                           the two lines      this left-hand             of

corresponds with the line                                     which one
the coinciding strong lines, viz. the vertical one, falls, appears
a  different place.     The place this faint line apparently occupies
is the intersection         that plane
                                 of                      of
                                             visual directions       the left                   of

the right eye, which contains the strong vertical line.
   This experiment affords another proof that there                    neces                   is   no
sary physiological connection between the corresponding points
of   the two retinae,             a    doctrine which has been maintained                                         by
so   many authors.

 to recede from the eye while the other remains at a constant
 distance; this is effected merely by pulling out the sliding board
 C (fig. 8) while the other C' remains fixed, the screw having pre

 is by  this experiment demonstrated, the observer is unable to
perceive what difference exists between the apparent magnitude
of the binocular image and that of the two monocular images;

   No question relating to vision has been so much debated as
the cause of the single appearance of objects seen by both eyes.
I shall in the present section give a slight review of the various
theories which have been advanced by philosophers to account
for this phaenomenon, in order that the remarks have to make                              I
in the succeeding section may be properly understood.
    The law of visible direction for monocular vision has been
variously stated by different optical writers. Some have main
tained with Drs. Reid and Porterfield, that every external point
is seen in the direction of a line passing from                 picture        the    its                    on
retina through the centre              the eye; while others have sup

                                                                            object                      an
                                                                                                of of
posed with Dr. Smith that the visible direction
coincides with the visual ray,             the principal ray
                                                     or               the pencil
which flows from                the eye. D'Alembert, furnished with
                                it   to
imperfect data respecting the refractive densities                 the humours            of
of   the eye, calculated that the apparent magnitudes                      objects                      of
would differ widely           the two suppositions, and concluded that
                                 an on
the visible point           ofobject was not seen           either      these  in                  of                 di

 could assign         no
                      reason for this law.         Sir David Brewster, pro
 vided with more accurate data, has shown that these three lines
 so   nearly coincide with each other, that “at                  inclination          an                              of

the real line       visible direction more than half degree, quan
                      of                                                              a                      a

which any point of an object is seen coincide only in this plane

   Dr. Wells's “new theory                            of

led   to  his new theory               by
                                   fact which

 So  little does Dr. Wells's theory appear           have been understood,to
that   no subsequent writer has attempted either                                                                  or

Notwithstanding these erroneous views, the “essay upon single
vision with two eyes” contains many valuable experiments and
remarks, the truth         which are independent
                                of                    the theory they               of
were intended             to
                     illustrate.
   The theory which has obtained greatest currency that which                                  is
assumes that        objectan   seen single because

 distance and position. This theory supposes that the pictures

sponding points of the two pictures falling on corresponding
points of the two retinae. Authors who agree with regard to
this property, differ widely in explaining why objects are seen in
the same place, or single, according to this law. Dr. Smith
makes it to depend entirely on custom, and explains why the
eyes are habitually directed towards an object so that             pictures                        its
fall  on corresponding parts          the following manner:—“When

                                                are then distincter than                                         if
they fell upon any other places; and since the pictures                  the                                of

    R and L (fig. 26) are the two eyes; CA, CA the optic axes
converging to the point A; and CABC' is a circle drawn through
the point of convergence A and the centres of visible direction
 CC'. If any point be taken in the circumference of this circle,
and lines be drawn from it through the centres of the two eyes
CC), these lines will fall on corresponding points of the two
retinae DD'; for the angles ACB, ACB being equal, the angles
DCE, DC/E are also equal; therefore any point placed in the
circumference of the circle CABC' will, according to the hypo
thesis, appear single while the optic axes are directed to A, or
to any other point in                it.

 with only one eye at a time though both remain open, one accord
 ing to them being relaxed and inattentive to objects while the
  other is upon the stretch.         It is a sufficient refutation of this
 hypothesis, that we see an object double when one of the optic
 axes is displaced either by squinting or by pressure on the eye
 ball with the finger; if we saw with only one eye, one object
 only should under such circumstances be seen. Again, in many
 cases which I have already explained, the simultaneous affection
 of the two retinae excites a different idea in the mind to that
 consequent on either of the single impressions, the latter giving
 rise to the idea of a representation on a plane surface, the former
 to that of an object in relief; these things could not occur did
 we see with only one eye at a time.
     Du Tour * held that though we might occasionally see at the
 same time with both eyes, yet the mind cannot be affected simul
 taneously by two corresponding points of the two images.                  He
 was led to this opinion by the curious facts alluded to in § 14.
 It would be difficult to disprove this conjecture by experiment;
 but   all that the experiments adduced                 favour, and others its
 relating    tothe disappearance        objects of                 to in
                                                     one eye really proves,
 is,  that the mind          inattentive
                                is            impressions made
                                                            to            one                     on
 retina when       itcannot combine the         impressions         the two               on
 retinae together          so   as   to
                                occasion     perception resembling that
                                                        a
of   some external object; but they afford                ground whatever      no
 for   supposing   that the mind cannot under           any   circumstances
 attend  to  impressions made simultaneously             points      the two   on          of
retinae, when they harmonize with each other                  suggesting            in                    to
the mind the same idea.
  A     perfectly original theory has been recently advanced                                              by
 M. Lehott, who has endeavoured               prove, that instead

Vallée 4, without denying the existence of pictures on the retina,
has advocated that we perceive the relief of objects by means of
anterior foci on the hyaloid membrane; and Raspailt has deve
loped at considerable length the strange hypothesis, that images
are not painted on the retina, but are immediately perceived at
the focus of the lenticular system of which the eye is formed.
                                                           § 16.
    It now remains to examine why two dissimilar pictures pro
jected on the two retinae give rise to the perception of an object
in relief.          I
                will not attempt at present to give the complete
 solution of this question, which is far from being so easy as at a
first glance it may appear to be, and is indeed one of great com
 plexity.       I
               shall in this place merely consider the most obvious
 explanation which might be offered, and show             insufficiency                its                         to

retinae in whatever manner the eyes be moved about, the optic
axes can during the experiment only correspond with a single
point of each.
   When an object, or a part of an object, thus appears in relief
while the optic axes are directed to a single binocular point, it
is easy to see that each point of the figure that appears single is
seen at the intersection of the two lines of visible direction in
which it is seen by each eye separately, whether these lines of
visible direction terminate at corresponding points of the two
retinae or not.
   But if we were to infer the converse of this, viz. that every
point of an object in relief is seen by a single glance at the inter
section of the lines of visible direction in which it is seen by each
eye singly, we should be in error.      On this supposition, objects
before or beyond the intersection of the optic axes should never
appear double,  and we have abundant evidence that they do.
The determination of the points which shall appear single seems
to depend in no small degree on previous knowledge of the form
we are regarding.  No doubt, some law or rule of vision may be
discovered which shall include all the circumstances under which
single vision by means of non-corresponding points occurs and
is limited.   I have made numerous experiments for the purpose
of  attaining  this end, and have ascertained some of the con
ditions on which single and double vision depend, the conside
ration of which however must at present be deferred.
   Sufficient, however, has been shown to prove that the laws of
binocular visible position hitherto laid down are too restricted
to be true. The law of Aguilonius assumes that objects in the
plane of the horopter are alone seen single; and the law of cor
responding points carried to                 its
                                      necessary consequences, though
these  consequences    were unforeseen              by         its

THEhismethod
       laborious and valuable     investigation is to ascertain the
specific gravities of a body when immersed in fluids of various
temperaturès, and thence, by means of the known expansion of
the fluid, to determine the cubic expansion of the body. A flask
was taken furnished with a carefully ground glass stopper; and
the first point to be ascertained was, “What weight of water,
freed from air, and at different temperatures, was the flask able
to contain     *For low temperatures, the flask and      contained                        its
water were placed         large vessel filled with the same fluid,

   Taking every possibility of error into account, M. Kopp con
siders that we may infer with certainty from the preceding num
bers, that the expansion of solid substances is by no means
determined by their chemical nature. The difference between
the coefficients of expansion for arragonite and calcareous spar is
so great as to destroy         hope          all

compounds; these latter being the sesquioxides generally, and
the so-called metallic acids.      This union has not been adopted
from any preconceived views, but has been forced upon me in
the course of these investigations. The minerals of the above
series are, in fact, so linked together, that it is frequently impos
sible to separate them without breaking through self-evident
analogies.      I am willing to allow that, in places,      I may have
gone too far; but in a system like that employed, much is ne
cessarily left to the judgement; and if the entire subject be care
fully reviewed, I think it will be admitted that the present essay
has upon the whole an opposite tendency.            Several of the pro
posed types, for instance, might upon certain grounds have been
 united; but they have been kept separate, partly in deference
 perhaps to almost irradicable prejudices, which bias one’s opinion
 even against the will, and partly as a matter of convenience.        It
 is to be remarked, however, that the present arrangement is
 merely offered as a provisional one; and that, from the difficul
 ties with which the subject is beset, it is easier to point out im
 perfections than to remedy them.

these quite as much entitled to the rank of distinct species, as
the various spinels and their allied aluminates, ferrites, chro

however, become obsolete as the science advances.           In placing
isomorphous substances under one common type or sub-type,
we do not necessarily consider them to be one mineral, as some
opponents of the chemico-physical system have attempted to
 establish.
                      Idocrase   Type :-Dimetric.
    Idocrase, 3RO, SiO3 + R*O°,      SiO3=rk;     hausmannite, MnO,

mite, Fe0, SiO2+2Ca(O, TiO2 *; willemite, 3ZnO, SiO2; diop
tase, 3CuO, 2SiO2+3H2O (Appendix, chrysocolla).
    Chrysocolla bears the same relation to dioptase as brown iron
ore to specular iron, and opal to quartz, amongst other examples.
Eudialite and dioptase are closely allied in a crystallographic
point of view.     The two known rhombohedrons of eudialite give
for the relative  lengths   of the vertical axis, 2:110 and 0.5279;
whilst the dioptase forms yield for the same, 1.059 and 0.530.
If  we consider the more obtuse forms as protaxial, we have, for
the notation of the above rhombohedrons, R and 4R in eudialite,
and R, 2R in dioptase.

+3RO, 2SiO4; babingtonite, 3ROSiO44-3RO, 2SiO2; glau
cophane (?), 3(3R0, 2SiO4)4-2(Al2O3, 2SiO4).
   Spodumene is placed under this type on the authority of Hart
well and Danaº.    In respect to credmerite, see the present volume
of the Philosophical  Magazine, Art. XXI. Glaucophane should
perhaps be placed near iolite.
                    Muscovite Type :-Monoclinic.
   Muscovite (potash mica), 3R0, 12A1*0°, 16SiO2; margaro
dite, RO, H2O, 2R*0°, 3SiO4; margarite, 3RO, 12A1*0°,8SiO3;
lepidolite; emerylite; euphyllite.
   This type is by no means a satisfactory one ; but so little is
known respecting the true nature of the micas, that it seems
advisable at present to keep them distinct from other minerals.
Muscovite was so named by Dana.
                    Phlogopite Type:–Trimetric.
   Phlogopite (magnesia mica),           9R0, 2Al-O", 5SiO2; rubellane
(a variety of phlogopite       7).

p. 693.    should confess, however, that the cleavage form
           I                                                  of   spodumene

members, to the augite              mi
                              hornblende group; but the physical

XXXIX.          On    the Amylum Grains of the Potatoe.    By A. G. C.
     MARTIN,         Librarian of the Imperial Polytechnie Institute of
     Vienna    +.
                                           [With     a    Plate.]
                                           I
Folthe   some time past      have been engaged in investigating
           phaenomena which occur when the amylum grains of
the potatoe  are subjected to the action of boiling water, and                                              I
have discovered a new fact which is not in accordance with the
present theory and prevailing notions concerning their structure.
   Although there is in microscopical observations great liability
to erroneous conclusions, and consequently extreme caution ne
cessary at every step, still too much timidity would speedily put
a stop to the progress of science, and hence        trust that the                I
scientific world will consider   my numerous  experiments   worthy
of being   submitted to a trial.
   Prior to commencing my experiments, made myself thoroughly       I
acquainted with                all
                      that had been written    the subject   amy           on                    of
lumt,     andfound that                         no
                                    instance was there any detailed
                                         in
account        of
            the phaenomena presented          the formation      amylum
                                                                in                          of
or the process       boiling.
                          of    This     easily accounted for
                                                          is          the                             by
fact, that precisely      the above

oblique or side light is obtained—an arrangement which cannot
be too strongly recommended to microscopists.        Before Plössl
made this  improvement,    I had to adopt a substitute, with which
every expert observer is probably familiar, but to which it may
be as well to call attention, because the success of experiments
requiring such nicety greatly depends on the proper adjustment
of the light.
   For observations by day-light, the reflector ought to be so
adjusted that the greatest quantity of light possible will be thrown
on the stage of the microscope, and the light is to be broken in
the following manner.       A strip of black paper, 3 inches long
and 1 inch wide             according
                           (i.   e.         the diameterto     the reflector),     of
must    be  placed, the black side outwards,           such      way over the
                                                                        in             a
                                           be on
reflector that      segment
                      a             both sides                     of
                                                    the latter will remain
uncovered, and the light           thrown obliquely        the stage.        on
                                                                            will                      It
often   be  expedient        to
                           cover the entire half       the reflector, leaving

duced.    During the progress of the rolling up, the space a is of
course constantly decreasing, while the parts on the inner edge
of the band offer a resistance. This resistance must be overcome
by contraction, in a direction tangental to the internal circum
ference; consequently a part of the band which has been by
accident, or from the unequal thickness of the vesicle, rolled up
before, or more than the rest, prevents the remaining part from
rolling itself up. Hence the cause of the elliptical form of the
band. The space at a now becomes continually smaller, until
the interior edges approach so close that they are joined together,
and the small hole hitherto remaining is closed.   The amylum

layers boil away to a kind of jelly and become liquid, or at least
mucilaginous, is also in opposition to the so often proved homo
geneousness of the amylum substance.        In short, the fact that a
grain completely pressed to pieces, when boiled under the micro
scope, is seen to swell up in            fragments, each  is all

   Fritsche's opinion, that the internal layers escape when the
external skin bursts, appears, considering the above,            quite                        to   be
inadmissible. What, then, becomes           the layers? The new     of
theory here propounded easily and satisfactorily answers the
question—they unfold themselves.       Of this the microscope will
furnish the  proof.   As soon      the observer has learnt

loosened      not visible, which
                 is                  very natural, because

 in consequence of      the layers varying in density. But what
 answer will be given    to the question, Why do the layers vary in
 density ? Without calling in aid a new hypothesis, that the
layers are formed from within (?), this question cannot be an
 swered by the mere formation of layers; whilst the rolling up
and ultimate growing together of the band produces, as already
observed, a condensation or pressure of the parts around the so
called kernel.     Hence the amylum grain resembles an unannealed
glass disc, and consequently in polarized light it must exhibit

prismatic images produced by interference+.
    Another analogous fact presented itself to me many years ago
in examining calcareous spar. Having had occasion to form an
artificial face upon one of the edges of the rhomb containing the
obtuse angle,             I
                     used a coarse file without water, and found that
it exposed faces of cleavage which had never been previously seen,
and which were inclined to the general surfaceproduced by thefilet.
    In examining the optical figures produced by the disintegra
tion of crystallized surfaces,                     I
                                    have found that by coarse sand
 stone, or the action of a rasp, or large-toothed file, we can expose
surfaces of crystallization with their natural polish differently
inclined to the general surfacef.
                                                                       by
    In    all
            these cases the faces, exposed        the mechanical action
of  grinding       filing, preserve their natural surfaces and polish,

in   the diamond may have aided            the productionin    the struc                     of

         Professor Faraday has made experiments to determine
the quantity of electricity associated with the particles or atoms
of matter.     He says it is wonderful to observe how small a
quantity of a compound body is decomposed by a certain portion
of electricity. One grain of water will require for decomposition
an electric current “equal to a very powerful flash of lightning+.”
Elsewhere he says, “the chemical action of a grain of water upon
four grains of zinc can evolve electricity equal in quantity to that
of a powerful thunder-stormt.” And he further declares, that
 from his experiments “it would appear that 800,000 such
charges     of the Leyden battery would be necessary to supply
 electricity sufficient to decompose a single grain of waterf.”
The Leyden battery to which he here alludes consists of fifteen

  292     Mr. M. Donovan       on the supposed Identity     of the Agent
  in order to form    a comparison, the number of discharges of the
  Dutch chemists was in effect but 42.677.           But it was afterwards
  shown   by  Dr.  Pearson,   that in these   experiments    not more than
  half the quantity of electricity employed by the Dutch chemists
  was active in decomposing the water, owing to the too great
  distance of the conducting wires from each other within the tube;
  thus would their estimate beat once reduced to 21,389 discharges.
  Faraday's estimate for the same duty is 800,000 such discharges,
  or nearly thirty-eight times greater than that of the Dutch
  chemists.
     In  1797, Dr. Pearson, assisted by Mr. Cuthbertson, made a
  set of experiments on this subject with unexampled labour.             In
  the only experiment completely reported by Dr. Pearson, it ap
  pears that from 16,836 discharges of a jar, containing 150 square
  inches of coated surface, he obtained almost half a cubic inch of
  the mixed gasº.      Hence 33,672 discharges would furnish almost
  a cubic inch of the mixed gas; and we may call 35,000 such
  discharges equal to an exact cubic inch. Therefore to obtain 7863
  cubic inches of the two gases, which together constitute one grain
  of water, 275,205 discharges should be employed if the resulting
  mixed gas were pure.        But five-eighths of it only were pure ;
  hence  440,328    discharges   would be required to produce 7863
  cubic inches of   pure   gas  from Dr. Pearson’s Leyden jar of 150
  square inches of coated surface.         Now as Pearson's discharges
 were made from a Leyden jar of 150 square inches of coated
 surface, while Faraday's were from a battery containing 244
 square feet, when the former are converted into the latter, the
 number of Pearson’s discharges required for the decomposition
 of one grain of water would be reduced to 18,817, which is forty
 two times less than Faraday's estimate.
     The estimate of Van Troostwyk and Deiman, corrected accord
 ing to Pearson, is 21,184 discharges for the decomposition of
 one grain of water; that of Pearson is 18,817; the difference is
 2367. This is as close an agreement as could well be expected
 in a comparison of such experiments.            But the vast difference
.
 of   Faraday's  800,000    discharges,   forty-two    times greater than
 Pearson’s estimate, is very striking, and leads to some suspicion
 of the universality of the law as laid down by that philosopher,
 namely, that water when subjected to the influence of the electric
current, no matter what the intensity or the acting surface so
that the quantity be the same, the quantity decomposed will be
          proportionate to the quantity of electricity which has
passedf.     All this may be very true when applied to the voltaic
influence; but if so, the law seems to individualize common

have become of the whole apparatus :
   Or even if we admit that the current consists of electricity
which had previously existed in the water, associated with the
particles of oxygen and hydrogen as their natural chemical affi
nity, for such Faraday views them, then the two electricities
must have passed through the metals, as he admits, and should
have destroyed them.      Again, if the two electricities did not
  ass, why was the minute wire in Wollaston's thimble battery
ignited ? and this wire being ignited, why was not the water
in my experiment heated to ebullition or total evaporation ? In
short, it were endless to express the objections which seem to
beset this doctrine of the enormous quantity of electricity asso
ciated with the particles of matter, and which is indispensable
to the hypothesis that quantity of electricity at a low intensity
is capable of explaining                       all
                             voltaic phaenomena.

is as the specific heat, we may substitute one for the other,

cific heat increases with the expansion, in different states of a
body it will be inversely as the specific gravity, or nearly so.

solid and liquid state may be called                                and

  1851.            “A Proof (by means of a series) that every Number
is  composed    of 4 Square Numbers, or less, without reference to the
properties of Prime Numbers.” By Sir Frederick Pollock, Lord-
Chief Baron, F.R.S. &c.
   The paper contains a proof, that if every number of the form
8n +4 is composed of 4 odd squares, then every number whatever
must be composed of 4 square numbers or less; also a proof of the
converse of this, viz. that if every number is composed of 4 square
numbers or less, then every number of the form 8n +4 must be com
posed of 4 odd squares.
    It is then proposed to show that every number of the form 8n +4
is composed of 4 odd squares, by taking a number of the form 8n +4,
viz. an odd square +3, and showing that 8n +4 in that case is
divisible into 4 odd squares (other than the odd square and 1, 1, 1);
thus 16n2+8n + 1 is a form that includes every odd square, and
 16n2+8n    +4 is divisible into

 8 is then added, and the sum is shown to be still divisible into 4 odd
 squares; and again 8, and so on, until by successive additions of
 8+8+ 8, &c., the quantity added to 16n2+ 8n becomes equal to the
 original term with which the operation commenced. The odd
 squares +3 form the series 4, 12, 28, 52, 84, &c.; and if the suc
cessive additions reach the third or some higher term, and also if
the sum added to 16n2+8m be equal to the term with which the
 operation commenced, it is contended the following term may be
 attained, and so on, and every mumber of the form 8n +4 will be
 composed of 4 odd squares. The paper concludes by a suggestion
 that the method is applicable to several other similar problems.
    2. “Observations on the Structure and Connexion of the Valves
 of the Human Heart.” By W. Savory, Esq. Communicated by
 Edward Stanley, Esq., F.R.S.
    The paper contains observations upon the structure and connections
 of the auriculo-ventricular and arterial valves of the human heart, which
 the author thinks will assist in explaining their nature and functions.
    The relation of the “four orifices” in the base of the heart is ex
 amined, and it is shown that the aortic and left auriculo-ventricular
 apertures are not separated as the others are; that no muscular
tissue of the ventricle intervenes between them, but that when the
auricles and great vessels are separated from the ventricles (which

may be accomplished with facility after prolonged boiling), the aortic
aperture is separated from the left auriculo-ventricular                    only by the
anterior mitral      valve;  and when this is removed (or even while it re
mains), it is plainly seen that only one aperture exists whose borders
are formed by the muscular tissue of the ventricle, and in shape
somewhat resembling the figure 8. This is divided into two por
tions, an anterior (aortic) and posterior (auriculo-ventricular)                   by the
anterior mitral valve, and above                       it,   by
                                                   the posterior wall         the aorta,         of

                                             the ventricle intervenes.
   When the auricles and vessels are removed,                            seen that theit   is
three orifices are bounded                       by
                                        thick and convex borders formed by
the bases          of
                   the ventricles.     Those on the left side are broadest;

direction       ofthe muscular fibres          these parts, are examined.

fibres forming the walls              the ventricles converge around these
                                            of
apertures.       The most superficial fibres may                  traced         be
                                                                               from the          up
walls   of   the ventricles, curving obliquely over the convex border,
and having their extremities, for the most part, fixed around the
orifices.     We may remove these fibres layer after layer, and still
find the same arrangement               obtain, the deeper fibres lying more
                                                 to

replaced       intheir natural situation,                observed that the auricles

an arrangement naturally to be expected from an intimate union of
the tendinous tissue of the valve with the arterial coat.
    The structure, connexions and relations of the valves is examined
chiefly by means of vertical sections carried through their centres
and adjacent parts.          Such sections of the arterial valves disclose an
important relation which they have with the upper border of the
ventricles.      The aorta and pulmonary artery, expanding towards
 their termination, are situated upon the outer edge of the ventricular
border before described; the consequence of which arrangement                                                                    is,

irregular fragments are occasionally observed between the principal

of the left side round to the posterior part, where it more or less
nearly joins the extremity of the larger bone. Thus the lateral and
posterior portions of the aortic orifice are surrounded by firm bony
arches meeting posteriorly in the centre.        From the large bone, a
small process usually passes backwards for some distance into the
muscular substance of the septum between the ventricles, and is
gradually lost in the dense fibrous tissue found in this part, sur
rounding the right border of the left auriculo-ventricular aperture;
and from the convex surface of the smaller portion, a thin process of
dense fibrous tissue is continued round the left margins of the auri
culo-ventricular orifice.    These heart-bones are intimately connected
above with the middle coat of the aorta, on the inner surface with
the base of the adjacent arterial valves, and posteriorly with the an
terior mitral valve; while at the sides, to their external and inferior
surfaces, the muscular fibres of the ventricle are attached.           They
may be seen and felt in the base of the pouches formed by the two
posterior aortic valves, and no doubt greatly assist in sustaining the
“force of the reflux.” They occupy the position of the two posterior
festoons of the aortic valves. In the human heart, in the situation
corresponding to the position of these heart-bones, the tissue com
posing the festooned rings is thicker and denser than elsewhere,
offering to the knife, in some cases, almost the resistance of bone.
The processes of dense fibrous tissue found in the anterior portion
of the border of the ventricular septum, &c., and extending round
the right and left margins of the auriculo-ventricular orifice, are     in
timately connected with the thickened portions of the adjacent
festoons.
   Among the tissues entering into the structure of the arterial valves,
elastic fibres are described.      They exist not only in the corpus
arantii, but delicate fibres of elastic tissue are found throughout the
valve; most abundantly in the thicker portions, but even in the
thinner portions (lunulae) a few delicate but well-marked elastic
fibres may be seen, particularly after the addition of acetic acid,
which of course assists greatly in bringing them into view.
   Muscular fibres have not been found in the arterial valves.
   The structure and connexions of the auriculo-ventricular valves
are next examined by means of vertical sections.          In tracing down
the muscular wall of the       auricle, it is observed to pass on to the
inner surface of the ventricular border, and if minutely examined is
seen to terminate by two attachments. The external portion, which
is considerably the larger, is closely connected with the fibrous
structure forming the “auriculo-ventricular ring,” while the thinner
internal portion is continued forwards for a very short distance be
tween the surfaces of the valve, and terminates more or less abruptly
by an attachment to      its  tendinous tissue. This       isgenerally best
seen  in one  of the tricuspid valves, where,     in   vertical section, the

                                attachment   to the ring.   In the posterior
mitral valve the muscular fibres seldom penetrate           so far forwards,
and this appears   to  result, when     section   ofthe parts     examined,

 from the much greater thickness and density of the lining membrane
 of the left auricle.
    The connexions of the anterior mitral valve, being peculiar, re
 quire a separate consideration.        In dissecting down between the
 anterior wall of the left auricle and the posterior surface of the
 aorta, it is seen that the central fibres of the auricular wall are closely
 attached to the adjacent wall of the vessel.       A little further dissec
 tion on either side will show that the muscular substance of the left
 ventricle is deficient between these parts.      At the sides indeed it is
 found, but is gradually lost at some distance from the mesial line.
 Hence these two orifices (the aortic and left auriculo-ventricular)
 are not separated as the others are by the intervention of the muscular
 fibres of the ventricle.  The structure and connexions of the ante
 rior mitral valve are examined by means of a vertical section,         in
 cluding the posterior wall of the aorta and the anterior wall of the
 left auricle.   If the lining membrane of the auricle be traced down
 wards, it is found to be directly continued on to the posterior surface
 of the valve, and the membrane on the anterior surface of the valve
 is continued upwards over the tendinous festooned ring of the aorta,
 on to the under surface of its semilunar valves. The anterior mitral
 valve lies beneath a portion of the two posterior arterial valves.
 The muscular wall of the auricle is observed to terminate by two
 distinct insertions.    The anterior (the larger) division of fibres is
 attached to the   posterior  surface of the aorta, opposite to, and below
 the festooned   ring, while the posterior portion is continued directly
 downwards for a short distance into the valve, and terminates by an
 attachment to its fibrous tissue. The posterior wall of the aorta
descends nearly vertically. Suddenly becoming much thinner oppo
site the upper border of the semilunar valve, it is continued down
to the festooned ring, or in other words, it here becomes blended
with the base of the semilunar valves.        Below this a dense layer of
fibrous tissue (which exists below, and fills up the spaces between
the attached bases of the semilunar valves) descends for some di
stance into the anterior mitral valve, immediately behind its anterior
surface.  It is by a close attachment to the posterior surface of this
layer that the muscular fibres of the auricular wall which descend
into the valve, terminate. This layer of fibrous tissue, however,
may be generally traced downwards into the valve farther than the
muscular fibres.
   The boundary, then, between the aortic and auricular apertures
is formed above the mitral valve by the posterior wall of the aorta,
terminating at    its
                   junction with the bases      the semilunar valves,

and immediately below the posterior surface           of
                                                       which  is attached
the greater portion     of the muscular fibres forming the anterior wall
of the left auricle.   The extremities of the two bones which in ru
minants    replacea   portion of   the lateral and posterior divisions   of
the “festooned     ring,”   nearly  meeting in  the centre, behind, give
additional   support    tothe structures  entering into the formation    of
the mitral valve.

cular  valves, it is noticed that a considerable portion of tendinous
fibres pass from the insertions of the cords, through the valves, to
the zones, and many of the smaller cords pass up directly into the
angle formed between the under surface of the valve and the inner
surface of the ventricle, and at once enter into the formations of the
fibrous zones. These cords are short, and many of them spring from
the wall of the ventricle, behind the valve. Therefore it results,
that these zones are densest and most strongly marked in those
portions corresponding to the attached borders of the valves, and
gradually become less distinct towards the intervals between them.
Hence the greater portion of the auriculo-ventricular zones is more
properly to be considered in connexion with the valves.
   The fibres of elastic tissue exist in the auriculo-ventricular valves,
but more sparingly than in the arterial valves.
   The many contradictory statements which have been advanced
concerning the existence of muscular fibres in the auriculo-ventri
cular valves, may perhaps be explained by a consideration of the
mode in which the muscular fibres of the auricles terminate, which
has been already described. The internal fibres which have been
mentioned, descending from the auricular walls into the valves just
beyond their attached margins, may be traced to a greater distance
in some cases than in others. They generally terminate by a tole
rably well-defined margin, but this varies. They usually descend
for a greater distance between the layers of the anterior mitral valve,
immediately beneath            its
                            auricular surface; but even here they are
seldom found  stretching  far into the valve, not terminating, however,
so abruptly.

tive philosophy, viz. the period of the alchemists, we find many na
tural phaenomena referred to spiritual causes.        Paracelsus taught
that the Archaeus or stomach demon presided over, caused and regu
lated the functions of digestion, assimilation, &c.
   Van Helmont, who may be considered in many respects the turn
ing-point between alchemy and true chemistry, adopted with some
modification the Archaeus of Paracelsus and many of the opinions of
the Spiritualists, but showed tendencies of a more correctly inductive
character; the term ‘Gas,” which he introduced, gives evidence of
the thought involved in it by       derivation from ‘Geist'its  ghost                                           a              or

   In the cases of heating, or ignition of a conjunctive wire or con
ducting body through which what is called electricity is transmitted,
we have many evidences that the matter itself is affected, and in some
cases temporarily, in others permanently changed ; thus if a wire of
lead is ignited to fusion by the voltaic battery, the fused lead being
kept in a channel to prevent                   dispersion,its     gradually shortens,   it

      To make evident to the audience the relation of the electrical dis
  charge to combustion and the fact that the terminals were themselves
  affected, the voltaic arc was taken, first between silver and then be
  tween iron terminals: in the first case a brilliant green-coloured
  flame was produced; and in the second a reddish scintillation or spur
  fire effect, just as in the ordinary combustion of the metals.
      So with the discharge of Franklinic electricity between the same
  two metals, a strip of silvered leather gave the bright green dis
  charge, while a chain of iron gave the spur fire effect.
     The known transport of particles of the terminals from one pole to
  the other,-the different effects of different intervening media on
 induction as shown in Faraday's experiments,            the polar tension of
  such   media,   &c. were instances of the train of molecular changes
 consequent upon electrical action.
     Hitherto the polarity of the gaseous medium existing between the
 metallic or conducting terminals of the electrical circuit was only
 known as a physical polarity and not shown to have an analogous
 chemical character with that existing in electrolytes anterior to elec
 trolysis; but Mr. Grove stated that in a recent communication to
 the Royal Society he had shown that mixtures of gases having oppo
 site electrical or chemical relations, such as oxygen and hydrogen, or
 compound gases such as carbonic oxide, were electro-chemically
 polarized or had their electro-negative and electro-positive elements
 thrown in opposite directions: thus if a silvered plate be made posi
 tive, in such cases it is oxidized; if negative, the dark spot of oxide
 is reduced ; and an experiment was shown in which such a plate was
 thus oxidized and the spot reduced in gaseous media.
     Here, as in the other experiments, was an effect on the terminals
 and an effect of polarization of the intermedium.         In the experiments
 hitherto shown, solid terminals were used; it became important to
 examine what would be the effect of liquid terminals, for instance
 water; the spark or disruptive discharge of Franklinic electricity was
 readily obtained from its surface, but hitherto no voltaic battery had
 been found to show a discharge at any sensible distance from the sur
 face of water.
     Mr. Gassiot had procured to be constructed 500 cells of the nitric
 acid battery, the combination discovered in 1839 by Mr. Grove and
 first shown at this Institution in the year 1840. The cells of this
                 it all
 battery were        well insulated            by
                                          glass stems, and      regards inten
                                                                       as
sity   of action     was probably far the most powerful ever seen.         Mr.
 Gassiot had kindly lent this apparatus for the illustration               this           of
evening's discourse, and            by   its
                                       aid Mr. Grove was able         show an   to

 discharge took place, the extremity of the platinum wire was fused,
 and the molten platinum attached to the wire, but kept up by the
 peculiar repulsive effect of the discharge was exhibited, as it were,
 suspended in mid-air, giving an intense light, throwing off scintilla
 tions in directions away from the water, and only detaching itself
 from the wire when agitated.
    Here water in the vaporous state must be transferred, for the im
 mersed electrode gave off gas, without doubt oxygen, and the mole
 cular action on the negative fused platinum resembled, if it were not
 identical in character with, the currents observed on the surface of
 mercury when made negative in an electrolyte.
    It may be objected to the theory proposed, that electrical effects
 are obtained in what is called a vacuum, where there is no interme
 dium to be polarized ; but this objection, though not applicable to the
 projection of the terminals, could hardly be discussed until experi
 mentalists had gone much further than at present in the production
 of a vacuum ; the experiments of Davy and others had shown that
 we are far off from obtaining anything like a vacuum where delicate
investigations are concerned.
    The view of the ancient philosophers that Nature abhors a vacuum
 which had been much cavilled at, and was supposed to be exploded
by the discovery of Torricelli, Mr. Grove thought had been unjustly
 censured : giving the expression some degree of metaphorical license,
 it afforded a fine evidence of the extent and accuracy of observation
of those who were unacquainted with inductive philosophy as a system,
but who necessarily pursued it in practice.      Whether a vacuum was
possible might be an open question, experimentally it was unknown.
    Lastly, in answer to those who might ask, to what practical results
do researches such as these lead       what accession of physical comfort
or luxury do they bring          Mr. Grove took occasion to offer his
humble protest against opinions now perhaps too generally prevalent,
that science was to be viewed only or mainly in its utilitarian or
practical bearings.     Even regarding it in this aspect, were it not for
the devotion which the love of knowledge, which the yearning anxiety
to penetrate into the mysteries of our being and of surrounding ex
istences induced; the practical results of science would not have
been attained; the band of martyrs to science from Socrates to Galileo
would not have thought and suffered without a higher incentive than
the acquisition of utilitarian results: without disparaging these results,
indeed regarding them as necessary consequences of any advance in
scientific knowledge, he considered that the love of truth and know
ledge for themselves was the great animating principle of those who
rightly pursued science; that, based upon an enduring quality of our
common nature, this feeling was rooted in far firmer foundations,
that it led to greater and more self-sacrificing exertions than any
capable of being induced by the hopes of augmenting social acquisi
tions, and was an attribute and an evidence of the non-transient part
of our being.

the union of the hydrogen with the oxygen.      Grove and Schönbein
adopt another explanation, assuming that in the hydrogen element
the platinum causes the hydrogen to combine with the oxygen of
the adjacent water-element, and in the oxygen element the pla
tinum causes the oxygen to combine with the hydrogen of the next
water-element.     In this way a motion of the hydrogen and oxygen
elements would occur from one side to the other, which would be
simultaneous with an electric current.
   As far as this point, the two above-mentioned philosophers agree.
But in the following experiment, which may be made with the gas
battery, their opinions differ.  If hydrogen be placed in one element
over dilute sulphuric acid, and the other be completely filled with
this liquid, at the moment of closure of the circuit      a feeble current
is detected by a multiplier, which emanates from the hydrogen ele
ment but soon disappears.        Grove explains this phaenomenon by
stating, that the hydrogen which appears in the tube filled with
dilute sulphuric acid combines with the small quantity of the oxygen
absorbed from the air existing in the liquid, and that the current
exists only so long as this is present.      Grove also assumes, that the
presence of oxygen in one of the tubes is essential to the formation
of a current; Schönbein, on the other hand, puts forward the opi
nion, that the formation of the current arises solely from the hydrogen
element, and that the oxygen in the other element only plays a pas
sive part. The cessation of the current would in this case be caused
by the hydrogen which appears in the element filled with dilute sul
phuric acid, electrically polarizing the platinum in the same manner
as occurs in the hydrogen element, whereby a counter-current is set
up which must destroy the original one.
   It is evident that this experiment does not decide the question as
to which of these views is correct. The author therefore instituted
a new one, the result of which is in favour of Schönbein’s view.
The author filled two of his gas-elements with muriatic instead of
dilute sulphuric acid, and filled one of these elements over this acid
with oxygen, but in such a manner that the strip of platinum dipped
into the muriatic acid. When the two elements were then closed
by a multiplier, the needle was quickly deflected, and this to a con
siderably greater extent than when it is deflected under the same
circumstances with the use of dilute sulphuric acid and oxygen.
The position of the needle was not, however, retained; it soon re
turned, and in a short time stood at zero.
    The reason why, on thus substituting muriatic for dilute sulphuric
acid, a stronger current was set up,            is,
                                             according     the author, that
                                                                to

                          amore easily decomposable liquid than dilute
sulphuric acid.                                                    the con
                                is be
                      this    the case, then less resistance            to

          a of
duction      the current                        it
produces     more powerful effect upon the multiplier. But the second
circumstance—that      the needle returned to zero—is of far more im
portance. The muriatic acid contained           atmospheric air. Muriatic

action of absorbed oxygen in the liquid is out of the question.
Neither could it be taken into consideration in regard to this circuit,
because   the body liberated in the tube filled with muriatic acid is
chlorine, which resembles oxygen, and hence does not annihilate its
action, but is associated with it in its effect. The cessation of the
current can therefore only be explained by the chlorine which is
liberated in the tube containing the liquid polarizing the platinum
in it in the same manner as the oxygen does in the tube containing
the gas.    This corresponds perfectly with the fact found by Grove,
according to which chlorine renders platinum even more strongly

electrically polar than oxygen does.
   Starting from this point of view, the author found that when a
strip of platinum is brought into contact with amalgamated zinc in
dilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen is evolved from the platinum.        Now
as platinum also possesses the property of causing hydrogen to
combine with electro-negative bodies, the author took advantage of
this circumstance to obtain hydriodic and hydrobromic acids.             If
iodine or bromine be added to the above-mentioned liquid, in a short
time     its
           colour disappears, and the hydrogen acids        these bodies                                   of

  A thin needle of silver wire, two inches in length, is suspended
horizontally from a glass fibre of exceeding fineness; the fibre
which passes in the usual manner through a glass tube is fast
ened to a torsion-head, the index of which being turned causes
the little needle of silver wire at the other end to follow it. The
needle lies across a thin strip of silver of                                its

   This table establishes the important result, that                    the electromo
tive force is   proportional       to the electric tension at the ends of the
newly-broken circuit.
   The following experiments were instituted to ascertain the
electroscopic properties of the active simple circuit.                      The author
considers it      practically      impossible          at present    to construct an
electronieter which shall directly declare the almost infinitesimal
tension which obtains at the various points of the simple circuit,
and hence the necessity of calling in the aid of the condenser:
the manner in which the instrument was charged is as follows:—
    From the lower condensing plate a wire of the same metal as
the plate itself proceeded, and was buried in the earth.                                A
branch was carried           from      this   wire     to  a   point a  of   the   closed
circuit. When another point, b, of the circuit was brought into
metallic connexion with the upper plate of the condenser, it be
came charged to an amount which depends upon the tension
existing at b, and on the condensing power of the plates.                               If
several such points, b, be examined, the charges imparted to the
condenser will be proportional to the electroscopic tension at the
different points. Instead of connecting the lower plate with the
earth, we might connect it and the point a directly, and bring
the upper plate, as before, into connexion with b; experiment
proves that the result obtained from this procedure is exactly
the same as that obtained by the former method.                          The mode of

riments, the point a being deprived of              electric tension    all                             by    its

certain unit, and that the distances along the datum line from
which the tensions are plotted are measured off with reference to
this unit; that, for example, if an inch of the fluid portion ex

the said fluid portion shall, on the datum line, be expressed by
a distance three times as great as that which expresses an equal
length of the solid portion; it is evident that when the resist

expresses the tension must be one uniform gradient from begin

      remarkable experiment which recently attracted the
THEattention of mathematicians,  being a practical demon       as
stration of the earth’s rotation, has already received various illus
trations and theoretical explanations; but        am not aware that        I
any explanation has yet been derived, according to rule, from the
differential equations of motion, which on the principles of dy
namics especially belong to the problem.          propose in this com      I
munication to form those      equations, and   by  means of them to
show that the facts observed may be explained on the hypothesis
of the earth’s rotation.
   The problem may be generally stated thus:—To determine
the motion of a ball suspended from a given point of the earth
by a slender cord, and acted upon by gravity, the earth being
supposed to revolve about an axis with a given angular velocity.
   Conceive a line to be drawn through the point of suspension
of the ball parallel to the axis of rotation of the earth, and a
motion equal and opposite to that which this line has in space
at any instant, to be impressed on                            all
                                                       the earth inclu

      all of
sive    the cord and ball. The line will thus                       rest,                            to
and      other points  will begin     move        they   to

about      with the earth's angular motion. By supposing this
          it
axis  toremain      rest, and the angular motion
                           at                             continue, the                to
motions we are about         consider will not

On this   supposition,  the direction     the force      gravity, being
                                                              of                      of

XLVIII.      On             Identity of the Agent concerned in the
                   the supposed
    Phaenomena of ordinary Electricity, Voltaic Electricity, Electro
    magnetism, Magneto-electricity, and Thermo-electricity.       By

                             [Continued from p. 299.]
                                   SECTION    IV.
Th;     foregoing experiments and reasonings are adduced by
     Professor Faraday in support of his opinions relative to the
enormous quantity of electricity which he conceives is naturally
associated with matter.   It was necessary to prove the existence
of a source so abundant as the vast quantity supposed to consti
tute the current required. Without this peculiar character of
the current, it could not be applied to explain the difference be
tween the effects of ordinary and voltaic electricity.  In further
support of that opinion, his next object was to prove that sup
plies of ordinary electricity equally abundant are required to
produce effects commensurate with those of voltaic electricity;
and as the cause must equal the effect, he thus derives a new
argument in favour of the intensely electrical condition of matter.
   In furtherance of these views, he made many experiments                          in
tended “to obtain a common measure, or a known relation as to
quantity, of the electricity excited by a machine, and that from
a voltaic pile, for the purpose not only of confirming their iden
tity” by proving “that the differences of intensity and quantity
are quite sufficient to account for what were supposed to be their
distinctive quantities,” “but also of demonstrating certain general
principles*.”
   To support the opinion of identity, and to account for the
dissimilarity of the voltaic and ordinary electrical current, he has
made   it a chief object to adduce facts calculated to determine the
ratio in which the two kinds of electricity are required to act in
producing equal effects.     A second object was to give additional
support to his view of the absolute quantity of electricity with
which matter is associated.       To facilitate this and many other
inquiries, he makes use of the following law:—“If the same
absolute quantity of electricity pass through the galvanometer,
whatever may be         intensity, the deflecting force upon the mag
                       its
netic needle    isthe samef.”
   The general method adopted           his experiments, was
                                         in                     charge    to
a Leyden battery with       certain number
                               a                  turns of    powerful
                                                                  of a
plate-electrical machine, occasionally varying the number          jars        of
employed,     totransmit the charge through         galvanometer, and
                                                          a
to note the deflection.         the first experiment, eight jars were

 336           Mr. M. Donovan on                     the supposed             Identity     of the Agent
“charged by thirty turns of the machine, and discharged through
the galvanometer, a thick wet string about ten inches long being
included in the circuit. The needle was immediately deflected
 22°4.”
      Seven more jars were then added to the eight, and the whole
  fifteen were charged by thirty turns of the machine.                    When the
  discharge was passed through the galvanometer, the needle de
  viated exactly to the 22nd degree as before.                The whole battery
  of fifteen jars was now charged with fifty turns of the plate, and
  the discharge was made through the galvanometer by means of
 various media.           Through a thick wet string, the charge passed
 at   once;     with a thin string, it occupied a sensible time; and
 with a thread, it required two or three seconds.                   “The current,
 therefore, must have varied extremely in intensity in these dif
 ferent cases, and yet the deflection of the needle was the same in
 all
 of        themt.” Hence                    he
                                       infers the law already mentioned, that
 the same quantity                 electricity affects the magnetic needle
                                      of
 equally,           no
                   matter what the intensity.
     In    the first place,         it     is   to    be
                                              observed that this law has not
 received universal assent.             Pouillet lays down the very reverse
of   it:        says, “We may call currents
               he                                       the same intensity those
                                                                        of
 which      produce   the same deflection:” “a current will have double
or    triple the intensity                 of
                                     another current when            produces de     it
 flections      ofwhich the sines are double            triple,”        or
                                                                      indicated          as                    by
 the   compass            of
                        sinesi.
     The experiments               Faraday, and the inference drawn from
                                      of
them, are very important, and require some scrutiny. He found,
it   is  true, that thirty turns                     of
                                            the plate produced         quantity            a                   of
electricity, which, whether received into eight                  fifteen jars, and  or
passed       through    the galvanometer, occasioned the same degree                                           of
deflection.        But       this there appears nothing but what might
                               in
have been        expected    and ought         happen.     The quantity
                                                          to                   elec                  of
tricity was the same                  in
                                    both cases: the     intensity    certainly dif
fered when eight               fifteen jars were used, that
                                 or                                       while the         is,

galvanometer      of 500 turns of wire doubly covered with silk, each
series of turns being separated by varnished taffetas, the devia
tion produced by the same machines was almost tenfold. Hence
in Faraday's galvanometer, the silk was capable of carrying as
much electricity as produced 40° or 44° of deflection *; and
anything more than this quantity was probably transmitted late
rally from wire to wire without passing through.                 He does not
inform us what the amount of deflection was in these experi

                             short that      was barely sensible.        “And

     In another  experiment,      the  battery     fifteen jars was charged  of
 by  sixty revolutions                     of
                               the machine, and discharged              before                           as
through the galvanometer: “the deflection                     the needle was               of

 on  this experiment     hereafter.    We   may  therefore deny that the
intensity was different          any       the experiments; and
                                               in              of       are                                     we

tensity, the deflecting force upon the magnetic                                              needle is the
same.”
        It
      is very important to recall here, that in Colladon’s experi
ments it was clearly proved, although the inference was not
drawn by him, that the highest deflections were produced by the
highest intensities.    With a Nairne’s electrical machine, be
tween the conductors of which a galvanometer was placed, he
could only obtain a deflection of 3° or 4°; but when the charge
of a large Leyden battery was silently passed through the galva
nometer by means of a point, the deflection amounted to 40°.
When he used a galvanometer capable of sustaining a high                                                     in
tensity, and consisting of 500 turns, a Nairne’s machine required
to be worked at the prodigious rate of three revolutions in a
second in order to produce a deflection of 35°; and without this
velocity, the necessary intensity not being produced, that amount
of deflection could not be obtained.      I do not see how these
facts are reconcileable with the law in question.
    The case appears to stand thus. The absolute quantity is the
total charge contained in the Leyden battery,                   which the              all   of
hypothesis assumes         pass       current

 sixteenth  jar made no difference in the results; the doubleguantity
 of  electricity was present.     The inference drawn was, that the
 angular deflection was doubled because the quantity of electricity
 was doubled.       The deflection and deflecting force would be in
 the same    ratio,  if every degree on the quadrant of the galvano
 meter were of equal value with regard to the resistance which
 terrestrial magnetism offers to the deflection of the needle+.
 But every experiment proves that this is not the case. It is
 proved by the researches of Lambert and Coulomb, that the
 effect of terrestrial magnetism on a freely suspended magnetic
 needle is as the sine of the angle formed by the magnetic meri
 dian with the magnetic axis of the needle. The sine of an angle
 of 22° being taken as = 1, the sine of an angle of 44° would be
 l'854; to have doubled the sine, i. e. the force which produced
 a deflection of 22°, would require that the needle in the second
 instance should have stood at 4843. The law of Lambert would
 apply to every degree in the quadrant of a galvanometer if it
 had but one wire, and if that one coincided with the magnetic
 meridian; but in galvanometers with a coil, the law does not
 apply. Melloni has shown, that when the needles are nearly
 astatic, the first 20° are in the direct ratio of the deflecting
 forcest; but in the galvanometer of his construction,      degrees                                    all
 above 20° bear     different value.

 Faraday's results would stand thus: the deflection 22° would
 indicate force a    22:3, but the deflection 44° would indicate

which partially defended it from further action.          When this
powder was removed and the plate replaced, the needle stood at
the original degree, but soon fell again owing to the same cause.

used more than once, the cause of which will be found in m

   The term made use of in the enunciation of Faraday's law is
“absolute quantity of electricity.”      The word absolute, perhaps,
implies that the quantity is not restricted by the condition of
intensity.    If the idea of totality be involved, the expression can
only apply to the discharge of the Leyden battery. When voltaic
electricity is in question, no part of it can be considered active
but that which is at any particular moment in the coil, without
reference to the portion already passed through or yet to arrive,
which latter may be said not yet to exist as the zinc is not yet
dissolved.    Hence the galvanometer can never be influenced by
the whole quantity that is to pass; it indicates things present,
not future.

      If these        experiments
                          and reasonings be correct, and    do not     I
           any source of fallacy, they appear unconformable to
  araday's law of equal quantities of electricity producing equal
deflections irrespectively of other circumstances.      Support is
consequently    withdrawn from his estimate of the enormous
quantity of electricity naturally associated with matter, an esti
mate founded on his experiment in which the voltaic action of a
pair of wires, acted on by acid, is said to have evolved electricity
equal to 300 or 360 dense sparks from a powerful electric
machine in the short space of Tºnths of a minute.

with this subject, have led me to the conviction that the longi
tudinal lines are not due to the irregularities alluded to, but are
produced by interference.      Whoever is accustomed to experi
ments on   light, will find the mere inspection of these lines suffi
cient to convince him that they are due to no mechanical cause.
The clearness and beauty with which they exhibit themselves,
and their sharp and definite character throughout their entire
length, distinguish them at a glance from those which might be
produced by unevenness of the slit’s edge, particles of dust, im
perfections of the apparatus, and so forth.
   In the first place, I have observed that the longitudinal lines
are entirely absent when a large lens is not applied, and when it
is placed close to the prism and at right angles to the rays issuing
from the same. I have further seen, that the lens changes the
breadth of the spectrum only, and not         length.            its

point where the longitudinal lines are visible. In the space bc
a superposition of two bundles, aSb, cIld, takes place.  The ray
Si, which belongs to the first bundle, and the other Li, of the
same colour, which belongs to the second, interfere with each
other in i under the very small angle SiD. When the ray pro
ceeding from S is intercepted by the card-board, the ray iS is
absent at i, and consequently no interference occurs at this point
of the spectrum.                                                                       -
   It is really interesting to observe how every line may be caused
to vanish by moving the card in a proper manner before the
lens. From these experiments it follows, that the phaenomenon
of the longitudinal lines is not peculiar to the spectrum, but that
in every case lines of interference must exist in light which has
passed through a convex lens.
     Itherefore removed the prism, and made the slit in the
window-shutter wider. White light now passed through the
lens. By moving the plane of projection backwards and for
wards, a position was at length found where the whole breadth
of the white image was intersected by splendid black lines which
                                                                                     i.

   It is scarcely necessary to remark, that made many experi I

no foreign influences come into play, which, however, is suffi
ciently proved by the mere inspection of them.

 364       Dr. Schunck on Rubian and                                  its   Products          of   Decomposition.
    The formula  this compound of                                 must             be   expressed         in    the   fol
 lowing manner:—
                               3(C14H4O4+CuO)+C++                                   H8O3.
These analyses show that verantine, like many substances, the
acid character     which   ofnot well-marked, combines with bases
                                             is
in various and complicated proportions.
      appears therefore that verantine differs from alizarine
     It                                                                                                                   by

                 l              oxygen.     According

same relation exists between alizarine and his oxylizaric acid.
He gives for alizarine the formula                                C*H"
                                                O°, and for oxylizaric
acid C*H*    O°,     that      so
                             equivs.      the latter contain

and not unfrequently, in a somewhat modified form, in acid
urine, and is called the neutral phosphate of ammonia and mag
nesia.    These forms are both figured in my “Practical Manual,”
&c., 1843, and in most other works on animal chemistry; but
their respective compositions have not, so far as              am aware,                 I
been determined, nor the connexion of the forms with the com
position been ascertained.      A knowledge of this deficiency                                           in
duced me in 1845 to prepare artificially and analyse the bibasic
or stellate form, which can be readily procured, and in a tole
rable state of purity, from healthy urine. This analysis was
published in the second part of my Manual, p. 58, and shows
that this phosphate agrees in composition with that prepared
artificially and analysed by Professor Graham”.           The difficulty
in  determining   the constitution of the neutral   salt, as it is called,
has depended upon the constancy with which it occurs mixed
                                  i.

solution, we occasionally meet with the prisms projecting from the
sides of the feathery portions.      This explanation of the respective
conditions under which these two forms are met with, is appli
cable to their occurrence naturally in animal fluids.            When
urine is   kept,   it gradually    becomes  ammoniacal;    and as the
ammonia is formed, it combines at once with the phosphate of
magnesia; hence the prisms are produced; and we never find
the feathery forms in either the urine or other animal fluids,
unless some portion of the liquid has been prevented from ad
mixture with the remainder by mucus, or some other such sub
stance, until after the fluid has become ammoniacal.        The “pen
niform”   crystals  of the ammonio-magnesian     phosphate  are merely
modified forms of the      stellate; they may be   readily obtained by
adding excess of ammonia to a very dilute solution of the phos
phate of ammonia and sulphate of magnesia, and are remarkable
for the curvatures of their rays.

Jan. 15,         PAPER was read, entitled, “On the Development of
  1852.           the Ductless Glands of the Chick.” By Henry Gray,
Demonstrator of Anatomy at St. George's Hospital.              Communicated
by W. Bowman, Esq., F.R.S.
   In this paper the author has demonstrated the evolution of the
spleen, supra-renal and thyroid glands, and the tissues of which
each is composed, in order to show the place that may be assigned
                                                              -
to each in a classification of the glands.
    The spleen is shown to arise between the 4th and 5th days, in a
fold of membrane which connects the intestinal canal to the spine
(the “intestinal lamina”), as a small whitish mass of blastema, per
fectly distinct from both the stomach and pancreas. This fold
 serves to retain it and the pancreas in connection with the intestine.
This separation of the spleen from the pancreas is more distinct at
 an early period of              its
                             evolution than later,      the increased growth  as
of   both  organs    causes them         approximate to more closely, but not
 more  intimately    with one    another;   hence  probably  the statement                                      of
 Arnold, that the spleen arises from the pancreas. With the increase
in  the growth         the organ and the surrounding parts,
                       of                                               gradually                it
 attains the   position   that    occupiesit   the full-grown  inbird,      more                      in
 immediate proximity with the stomach; hence probably the state
 ment  of  Bischoff, that       arises from the stomach.
                                       it                     Later, when its
 vessels are    formed,    the membrane          which      was developed
                                                                in                 it                           is
 almost completely absorbed.
    The author then considers the development                                      of
                                                                                                       of of
                                                           the tissues        the
 spleen, which clearly establishes, not only the glandular nature             the
 organ itself, but the great similarity           bears with the supra-renal
                                                                 it
 and thyroid glands.
    The external capsule and the trabecular tissue              the spleen are          of
 both developed between the 8th and 9th days, the former                      the                      in
 form  of   a thin membrane composed              nucleated fibres, the latter

 consisting      similar fibres, which intersect the organ

    The author lastly traces out the development                        the thyroid          of

spleen and supra-renal glands, from the similar structure they pre

sent, and from the development of those structures occurring in a
similar manner in each.
    These glands are developed between the 6th and 7th days as two
separate masses of blastema, one at each side of the root of the neck,
close to the separation of the carotid and subclavian vessels, and be
tween the trachea and the branchial clefts, but quite independent, as
far as regards their development, of either of those parts. Their
minute structure at an early period closely corresponds with that of
the spleen and supra-renal glands.         Later, when the gland tissue of
which the    thyroid  gland  ultimately  consists is formed, it is developed
in a manner     precisely similar to the same tissues of the spleen and
supra-renal glands, a fact which shows the analogy they bear to one
another.
    From these observations the author concludes that a close analogy
 exists between the glands already described, so that the propriety of
 their classification under one group, as the “Ductless Glands,” may
 be considered clearly proved.       And although the spleen by many
 has been excluded from them, the author considers that its classifica
 tion with them is correct, for the following reasons:—1st. From its
 evolution being similar with that of the supra-renal and thyroid
 gland; 2nd. from             its
                           structure, which                         an

 corresponds with them; and 3rdly, from the development
                                                                                                   of of

 riments of Professor Bischof of Bonn, on the contraction of granite
 and other rocks in passing from the fluid to the solid crystalline
 state. From the results of these experiments, he has been led to
 assign a new form to the function expressing the relation of the
 earth's principal moments of inertia. Referring to his paper for the
 mathematical processes by which he arrived at this result, he states
 that, from the theory he has ventured to adopt, it follows that, as
solidification advances, the strata of equal pressure in the fluid
 spheroidal nucleus of the earth acquire increased ellipticity, and
each stratum of equal density successively added to the inner surface
of the solid crust is more oblate than the solid strata previously
formed.
   From these considerations alone, he remarks, it is evident that
the difference between the greatest and least moment of inertia of
the earth would progressively increase during the process of solidifi
cation.     It follows, therefore, that if the earth's axis of rotation
were at any time stable, it would continue so for ever.       But from
the laws of fluid equilibrium the axis must have been stable at the
epoch of the first formation of the earth's crust; consequently it
continued undisturbed as the thickness of the crust increased during
the several geological formations. Thus it appears that the displace
ment of the earth's interior strata, instead of having a tendency to
change      axis  itsrotation, tends
                               of        increase the stability  to

    Feb. 19.-The reading of Mr. Sharpe's paper, “On the Arrange
 ment of the Foliation and Cleavage of the Rocks of the North of
 Scotland,” commenced at the last meeting, was resumed and con
 cluded.
    The author applies the term,     cleavage or lamination, to the divi
 sional planes  by  which stratified rocks are split into parallel sheets,
 independently of the stratification; foliation, to the division of crystal
 line rocks into layers of different mineral substances; slate, to strati
 fied rocks intersected by cleavage; and schist, to foliated rocks only
 which exhibit no bedding independent of the foliation.
     He considers that no distinct line can be drawn between gneiss
 and mica schist, chlorite schist, &c., which pass from one into the
 other by insensible gradations; have the same geological relations,
 and foliation subject to the same laws. He states that their boundaries
 have been laid down arbitrarily on the published maps of Scotland.
The quartz rock of Macculloch includes two formations; the one,
a quartzose variety of gneiss, included in this paper under that head;
 the other, a stratified sandstone altered by plutonic action.
    The author treats the foliation of gneiss and schist as a series of
simple curves, obtained by observing the general direction, and dis
regarding the minor and more complicated folds.          The convolutions
are usually greatest where the dip is slightest, but where the folia
tion is vertical or nearly so, it usually follows true planes without
contortion; thus the most correct observations are those taken where
the foliation is vertical.
    When the foliation of gneiss and schist is traced over extensive
areas, and the minor convolutions disregarded, it is usually found
to form arches of great length and many miles in diameter, bounded
by vertical planes, between which the inclination increases with the
distance from the axis.      Each arch is succeeded by a narrow space
in which the dip is irregular, and beyond which another arch com
mences of a form similar to the first.         Portions of two adjoining
arches seen without the rest form the fan-like structure observed by
several geologists.     The arrangement of the foliation in arches cor
responds with that of the cleavage of the true slates previously de
scribed by the author, except in the greater convolution of the gneiss
and schist.              -
    Along the southern border of the Highlands a band of stratified
clay slate rests on mica schist: at the junction, the foliation of the
schist conforms to the cleavage of the slate, and the two together
form an arch, but there is no connection between the stratification
of the slate and the foliation; moreover, the divisional planes cross
from one rock to the other, without change of direction, being planes
of foliation in the mica schist, and of cleavage in the slate: these
facts confirm Mr. Darwin's opinion, that cleavage and foliation are
due to the same cause.
    The author describes the parallel arches of foliation which cross
the Highlands, illustrating his description by sections and a map

on which they are laid down, and tracing in detail the vertical
planes which bound the arches.             Commencing on the south, the
first vertical plane runs about four miles within the Highland border,
with a mean direction of about N. 55° E. : it crosses more than
once the junction of the clay slate and mica schist.             South of this
plane the cleavage of the slate forms the beginning of an arch,
which ends abruptly at the junction of the slate with the Old Red
Sandstone.
    To the north of this vertical plane four arches run across the High
lands: the most southern of these, with a diameter of ten or twelve
miles, is formed partly of the cleavage of the slate, and partly of the
foliation of the mica schist.        The hills on the south side of Loch
Tay coincide with its central axis. The vertical plane which forms
of its
     northern boundary crosses Ben Lawers, and has              mean direction                 a

Iris.”  By B. E. Brodhurst, Esq., M.R.C.S. Communicated by Thomas
Bell, Esq., Sec. R.S.
   The observations made in this paper are distributed under three
heads. First, the author examines the iris in conjunction with the
organic system of nerves. Secondly, he exposes the relation of the
several nerves of the orbit in reference to the iris. And, thirdly, by
tracing the membrane through the lower orders of animals, he shows
the influence of the ophthalmic ganglion upon the iris, and the ne
cessity of          its
              presence for the accomplishment        the motions   the                  of                         of

   The author then proceeds to state the effect of irritation and divi
sion of the several nerves of the orbit. He finds, that, on irritating
the third nerve within the cranial cavity, slight contraction of the
pupil ensues, to be followed by dilatation.   On dividing the third
nerve, the pupil becomes dilated beyond its median extent.
   Irritation of the optic nerve within the cranium produces con
traction of the pupil. Section of the same nerve gives rise to an
insensible retina and a dilated pupil.
   Irritation of the fifth nerve excites slight motion in the iris. Divi
sion of the fifth produces temporary contraction of the pupil.        In
the space of half an hour this effect will have ceased, and-   the pupil
will have resumed its former diameter.
   If a slight galvanic current be passed along the sympathetic, con
traction of the pupil will be produced; but let the sympathetic be
divided, at the superior cervical ganglion for instance, and instantly
the pupil shall forcibly contract, and again widely dilate.
   If a weak galvanic current be used, and the poles brought into
contact with the sclerotica at its junction with the cornea, contrac
tion of the pupil to two-thirds of its actual diameter takes place,
and this effect continues so long as the current continues to be
formed; but on breaking connection, the pupil immediately resumes
its former diameter. So soon as life is extinct, galvanism ceases to
affect the iris, whether applied to the membrane itself, through the
external coats, or though the poles be in contact with the retina;
but     if applied   to the sympathetic, movement may be excited in the
Irls.
   The optic nerve being divided, the pupil is dilated: irritation of
the third nerve then produces merely a slight and momentary effect
upon the iris; but if the sympathetic be divided, the pupil will con
tract violently, and again dilate beyond its previous state of dilata
tion.
   The sympathetic being divided, irritation of the cranial nerves
does not affect the iris; but though the cerebrum and corpora
quadrigemina be removed, division of the sympathetic will still ex
cite the iris to motion.   And, consequently, the author infers that
the basic or primary motion of the iris is derived from the vis motoria
of the excito-motor ganglionic system : he shows also, that where
the ophthalmic ganglion is wanting, as in fishes and reptiles, the iris
is motionless.    Allusion     is,

quent effect upon the iris: they are classed       follows:–

   And from what has gone before, it is concluded, that contraction
of the pupil is the active state of the iris, and that dilatation is                                                    its

  analogous to stibaethyle by a similar process *.               It corresponds to
  trimethammine, being Sb C*H9–SbMe", and yields a series of com

  of  methyle,   an   emergetic   combination ensues, and a crystalline pro
 duct is obtained which is        SbMe"I,    the equivalent of Hofmann's iodide
 above described.         Decomposed      by  oxide of silver, the hydrated oxide
 of the new      base,  which the author calls stibmethylium, is obtained ;

out any basic characters, like oxamic acid. Glycocoll is to be re
garded as the isomer of glycollamic acid, precisely as the alkaloids,
furfurine and benzoline, are known to be isomers—allotropic forms
of the normal acids; and corresponds to aethammine less H3+ O°, or
to the product which should be obtained by the oxidation of SbFt.
Its capacity to exchange H for K is unlike that of acetic acid or alcohol,
for the saline power of these belongs not to the carbo-hydrogen ele
ments, but to the unreplaced H of the H2O.         Nor in this view is the
saline hydrogen   of  glycocoll similar to that of oxamic acid; it is an
atom of  hydrogen    in the ammonia itself, which is replaceable, as in
asparagine, itself the binamide of a bibasic acid, and in paramide.
     Iconclude these observations by calling attention to the results
obtained by Dr. Hofmann in decomposing the compound ammonias
by a nitrite *. I was the first to show that the elegant process by
which Piria had succeeded in decomposing asparagine and some
other amides, was applicable to the organic alkaloids, and that the
action of nitric oxide upon a dilute acid solution of nitrate of aniline
yields nitrogen gas and phenolet. Dr. Hofmann refers to my state
ment, but adds, that in repeating my experiment the aniline was
transformed into a brown mass containing a crystalline matter which
was nitric phenole. He probably obtained the binitric species which
is the first product of the action of nitric acid upon phenole, and
which, as described in my paper, I actually prepared from the phenole
thus obtained, by treating it with strong nitric acid, in the process
for preparing the nitropicric acid.              keeping     If,mind the greatin

    A curious subject of inquiry presents itself in regard to those
bases which contain two and three equivalents of the alcoholic ele
ments.    If the decomposition were to take place in accordance with
the formula above given, nitrate of biaethylamine would yield C*H10O,
which is the aether of alcohol, or its isomer butyric alcohol, and
triaethylamine, CºH"O, which is the formula of caproic alcohol.
The decomposition of all the complex alkaloids by this reaction will
be of great interest.—Silliman's American Journal, March 1852.

tungstate of soda is fused in a Hessian crucible with excess of pure
chloride of calcium at a moderate red heat, and the mass when cold,
washed with water. The salt is then left, forming a heavy, very
crystalline, sparkling powder, in which the separate crystals are
easily distinguishable by a simple lens.     By using some pounds of
the  materials, we  might  certainly  succeed in obtaining crystals so
large that their form might be distinguished by the naked eye.
Even with a magnifying power of 45 diameters, this crystalline
powder may be seen to consist of clear, very shining and sharp cry
stals, many of which appear to be true square octohedra, but most
of them are combinations with many facets. Some of the former
were sufficiently large to be measured by the goniometer.       I found
the angle of the basal edges of the octohedra = 130°20' 30", thus
agreeing with the corresponding angle of the compound occurring as
a mineral.
   The specific gravity of this artificially prepared Scheelite I found
to be =6-0759. That of the natural is given as 5-9 to 6.2.
   With this agreement in form and density, an analysis was hardly
requisite.   However, I have also made this, by heating the finely
powdered salt with carbonate of soda, as it has been shown, that,

Hence the loss considered          as

                          EQUIVALENT        of Phosphorus.
    Prof. Schrötter has determined the equivalent of phosphorus by
burning amorphous phosphorus in oxygen gas. A mean of ten de
 terminations, which scarcely differ, gave as the true equivalent 387-5
 on the oxygen, or 31 upon the hydrogen scale.                             One gramme of
phosphorus according to this yields, on burning, 2.289.186 grims.
 of phosphoric acid. Pelouze's determination, 32, is consequently
too high.-Journal          fir  Praktische Chemie, vol. liii. p. 435.
                  PRODUCTION OF CYANIDE OF POTASSIUM.
    M. Rieken has confirmed by careful experiments the results of
Bunsen and Playfair, that cyanide of potassium is formed when car
 bonate of potash intimately mixed with carbon is heated to whiteness
 in a current of previously heated nitrogen gas. The temperature
 must be that at which potassium is formed, and the nitrogen must
 be strongly ignited before passing over the mixture.                          The necessity
of fulfilling these conditions will render the process very difficult of
 execution upon a large scale.—Ann, der Chemie und Pharmacie,

ably fine and dry, with a high barometer and thermometer.                The average quantity
of rain in March for six previous years was 2.55, and in one month only was the
quantity smaller, viz. Sept. 1846, when it was only '60. The average temperature
of March for twenty-six previous years 40°38. The average state of the baro
meter has not been higher since May 1844, when it was 30-213.

 402                Dr. Faraday   on the Physical Character                        of
the indications given by a magnetic needle, and in numerous
 cases with great and peculiar advantages.     The definition then
 given had no reference to the physical nature of the force at the
 place of action, and will apply with equal accuracy whatever
 that may be ; and this being very thoroughly understood, I am
 now about to leave the strict line of reasoning for a time, and
 enter upon a few speculations respecting the physical character
 of the lines of force, and the manner in which they may be sup
 posed to be continued through space. We are obliged to enter
 into such speculations with regard to numerous natural powers,
 and, indeed, that of gravity is the only instance where they are
apparently shut out.
    3244. It is not to be supposed for a moment that speculations
of this kind are useless, or necessarily hurtful, in natural philo
sophy. They should ever be held as doubtful, and liable to
error and to change; but they are wonderful aids in the hands
of the experimentalist and mathematician; for not only are they
useful in rendering the vague idea more clear for the time, giving
it something like a definite shape, that it may be submitted to
experiment and calculation; but they lead on, by deduction and
correction, to the discovery of new phaenomena, and so cause an
increase and advance of real physical truth, which, unlike the
hypothesis that led to           it,
                             becomes fundamental knowledge not
subject     tochange.   Who         not aware        the remarkable pro

lines of magnetic force and of electric force agree.      Results of
this kind are well shown in some recent     experiments on the effect
of iron, when passing by a copper wire in the magnetic field of
a horseshoe magnet (3129.3130.), and also by the action of
iron and magnets on each other (3218. 3223.).

                             think, that the experimental data are
as yet insufficient for a full comparison of the various lines of
power. They do not enable us to conclude, with much assu
rance, whether the magnetic lines of force are analogous to those
of gravitation, or direct actions at a distance; or whether, having
a physical existence, they are more like in their nature to those
of electric induction or the electric current. I incline at present
to the latter view more than to the former, and will proceed to
certain considerations    bearing on the question, with a view to
the further and future elucidation of the subject.
   3257. I think I have understood that the mathematical ex
pression of the laws of magnetic action at a distance is the same
as that of the laws of static electric actions; and it has been
assumed at times that the supposition of north and south mag
netisms, spread over the poles or respective ends of a magnet,
would account for               all   its
                                external actions          other magnets      on                             or
bodies.        In
                either the static        dynamic    or
                                                   view,           any other       or      in
like them, the exertion          the magnetic forces outwards,
                                          of                              the                         at
poles  or ends           of
                      the magnet, must                             be    an
                                                       essential condition.
Then, with       given bar-magnet, can these forces exist without
                     a                                                                                      a

                     of                                  other sources?   in                               I
do   not believe they can        because,
                                       ;          have shown  as   I   recent                   in

tion across them taken anywhere externally between the poles
 (3109.).    Besides that, there are many other experimental facts
which show the relation and connexion                               one pole

               at                            also the analogy with static

cases.

408             Dr. Faraday on    the   Physical Character   of
   3258. But supposing this necessary relation, which constitutes
polarity, to exist, then how is it sustained or permitted in the
case of an independent bar-magnet situated in free space?           It
appears to me, that the outer forces at the poles can only have
relation to each other by curved lines of force through the sur
rounding space; and          I
                            cannot conceive curved lines of force
without the conditions of a physical existence in that interme
diate space.   If they exist, it is not by a succession of particles,
as in the case of static electric induction (1215. 1231.), but by
the condition of space free from such material particles.      A mag
net placed in the middle of the best vacuum we can produce,
and whether that vacuum be formed in a space previously occu
pied by paramagnetic or diamagnetic bodies, acts as well upon
a needle as if it were surrounded by air, water or glass; and
therefore these lines exist in such a vacuum as well as where
there is matter.
   3259. It may perhaps be said that there is no proof of any
outer lines of force, in the case of a magnet, except when the
objects employed experimentally to show these lines, as a mag
netic needle, soft iron, a moving wire, or a crystal of bismuth,
are present; that these bodies, in fact, cause and develope the
lines; just as in the case of gravity no idea of a line of gravita
ting force, in respect of a particle of matter by itself, can be
formed: the idea exists only when a second particle is concerned.
We are dealing, however, with a dual power; and we know that
we cannot call into action, by magnetic induction upon soft iron
or by electric currents, or otherwise, one magnetism without the
other.    Supposing, therefore, a bar of soft iron, or another bar
magnet, when brought end on and near to the first magnet, did
by that approach develope the external force, the power which
then only would become external should produce a corresponding
external force of the contrary kind at the opposite extremity, or
should not. If the first case occurs, it should be accompanied
by the development of lines of force equivalent to it within the
magnet. But I think we know, now, that in a very hard and
perfect magnet there is no change of this kind (3223.). The outer
and the inner lines of force remain the same in amount, whether
the secondary magnet or the soft iron is present or away.          It is
the  disposition only  of the outer lines that is changed;  their sum,
and therefore their existence, remains the same.        If the second
case occurs, then the magnet, if broken in half under induction,
should present in      its
                        fragments cases      absolute magnetic charge,
                                              of
or charge with one magnetism only (3257. 3261.).
   3260. Or     if
                 it   imagined for moment, that the two polarities
                      be                a
of the bar-magnet are         relation
                             in            each other, but that whilst
                                             to
there is   no external  object    to   acted upon they are related
                                        be                           to

                       the Lines   of Magnetic   Force.               409
each other through the magnet itself (an idea very difficult to con
ceive after the experimental demonstration of the course of the
lines as closed curves (3117.3230.)), still it would follow, that upon
the forces being determined externally, a change in the sum of
force both within and without the magnet should be caused. We
can now, however, take cognizance of both these portions of force;
and it appears that, with a good magnet, whether alone or under
the influence of soft iron or other magnets of fourfold strength,
the sum of forces without (3223.), and therefore also within
(31.17. 3121.) the magnet, remains the same.
   3261. If the northness and southness be considered so far
independent of each other as to be compared to two fluids dif
fused over the two ends of the magnet (like the two electricities
over a polarized conductor), then breaking the magnet in half
ought to leave the two parts, one absolutely or differentially north
in character, and the other south.      Each should not be both
north and south in equality of proportion, considering only the
external force.   But this never happens.    If it be said that the
new fracture renders manifest, externally, two new poles, oppo
site in kind but equal in force (which is the fact), because of the
necessity of the case, then the same necessity exists also for the
dependence and relation of the original poles of the original
magnet, no matter what or where the first source of the power
may be. But in that case the curved lines of force between the
poles of the original magnet follow as a consequence; and the
curvature of these lines appears to me to indicate their physical
existence.
  3262.      If
             the magnetic poles in a bar-magnet be supposed to
exert some kind of power internally, backward, as if they were
centres of force, both within and without the magnet, by which
they are able, upon the breaking of the magnet, to develope the
contrary poles and their force, then that power cannot be the
identical portion which is at the same time exerted externally;
and if not the same, then when the magnet is broken, the two
halves ought to have a degree of north or south charge.        They
ought not to be determinate magnets having equipotential poles.
But they are so; and we may break a hard magnet in half whilst
opposed to another powerful magnet which ought most to disturb
the forces, and yet the broken halves are perfect magnets, equi
valent in their polarities, just as        if,
                                         when they were made              by
breaking, the dominant magnet was away.           The power      theat
old poles     neither increased nor diminished, but remains
             is                                                           in
amount and       polar direction unchanged.
                  in
   3263.   Falling  back, therefore, upon the case       hard, well
                                                          of

powers,  it appears     to
                       me that        we

 tendency towards or action upon each other, or else admit that
 there is such an action exerted in or transmitted on through curved
 lines. To deny such an action, would be to set up a distinction
 between the action of the north end of a bar upon        south end,                                     its

tery presents such a case, and resembles a magnet in the dispo
sition of the external lines of force.        But the sustaining action
(as   regards the induction)     being   dependent upon the necessary
relation of the opposite dual conditions of the force, is external
to the conductor, or the battery; and in such a case, if the con
 ductor or battery be separated in the middle, no charge appears
there, nor any origin of new lines of inductive force.               This                                      is,
 no  doubt,    consequence

                                   the fact, that the lines        static in                 of
 ductive force are not continued internally; and,            the same time,         at
a  cause why the two divided portions remain                opposite states        in
 or  absolutely charged.                   In
                                   the magnet such        division does de     a

the gain of intensity in the former case may be produced, but
there is none as yet distinctly recognised.   Like electric currents,
side by side, add their quantities together; a case supplied either
by uniting several batteries by their like ends, or comparing a
large plate battery with a small one.       Like magnetic lines of

   3269. The mutual relation of the magnetic lines of force and
the electric axis of power has been known ever since the time of
GErsted and Ampère.      This, with such considerations as have                  I
endeavoured to advance, enables us to form a guess or judgement,
with a certain degree of probability, respecting the nature of the
lines of magnetic force.         I
                             incline to the opinion that they have
a physical existence correspondent to that of their analogue, the
electric lines; and having that notion, am further carried on to
consider whether they have a probable dynamic condition, ana
logous to that of the electric axis to which they are so closely
and, perhaps, inevitably related, in which case the idea of mag
netic currents would arise; or whether they consist in a state of
tension (of the aether ?) round the electric axis, and may there
fore be considered as static in their nature.     Again and again
the idea of an electro-tonic state (60. 1114. 1661. 1729. 1733.)
has been forced on my mind; such a state would coincide and
become identified with that which would then constitute the
physical lines of magnetic force.       Another consideration tends
in the same direction.               I
                                formerly remarked that the mag
netic equivalent to static electricity was not known; for if the
undeveloped state of electric force correspond to the like unde
veloped condition of magnetic force, and if the electric current
                                º
or axis of electric power correspond to the lines of magnetic force
or axis of magnetic power, then there is no known magnetic con
dition which corresponds to the static state of the electric power
(1734.).    Now assuming that the physical lines of magnetic
force are currents, it is very unlikely that such a link should be
naturally absent; more                         I
                                        think, than that the magnetic
condition should    depend   upon  a state of tension; the more espe
cially    as,
           under the latter supposition, the lines            magnetic of
power would have        physical existence
                          a                       positively
                                                        as           the    as   in
former case, and the curved condition          the lines, which seems
                                                   of
to  me such    necessary admission, according
                a                                     the natural facts,

                   view of a magnet, the medium or space around
it is as essential as the magnet itself, being a part of the true
and complete magnetic system.        There are numerous experi
mental results which show us that the relation of the surrounding
space can be varied by occupying it with different substances;
just as the relation of a ray of light to the space through which
it passes can be varied by the presence of different bodies made
to occupy that space, or as the lines of electric force are affected
by the media through which either induction or conduction takes
place.   This variation in regard to the magnetic power may be
considered as depending upon the aptitude which the surrounding
space has to effect the mutual relation of the two external pola
rities, or to carry onwards the physical line of force; and I have
on a former occasion in some degree considered it and            con                                     its

 being able to sustain external lines of force to that amount. But
if a third bar, two inches long and also five-tenths in diameter,
be magnetized at the same time, it can receive much more power
than the second one. A natural reason for this presents itself
by the hypothesis; for the limitation of power in the two cases
is not in the magnets themselves, but in the external medium.
The shorter magnet has contact and connexion with that medium
by a certain amount of surface; and just what power the medium
outside that surface can support, the magnet will retain.                    Make
the magnet as long again, and there is far more contact and rela
tion with the surrounding médium than before; and therefore
the power which the magnet can retain is greater.                  If there were
such limited points of resulting action in the magnet as is often
understood by the word poles, then such a result could hardly
be the case, on my view of the physical actions.                 But such poles
do not exist.      Every     part  of the surface of the magnet, so to
say, is pouring forth externally lines of magnetic force, as may
be seen in figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 (3274.).           The larger the magnet, to a
certain   extent, and the     larger   the amount of external conducting
medium in contact with                      it,
                                     the more freely          this transmission is
made.      If the second magnet, being               inch long,      an conceived             be

    3297. With regard to the great point under consideration, it
is  simply,   whether the lines of magnetic force have a physical
existence or not? Such a point may be investigated, perhaps
even satisfactorily, without our being able to go into the further
questions of how they account for magnetic attraction and repul
sion, or even by what condition of space, aether or matter, these
lines consist. If the extremities of a straight bar-magnet, or if
the polarities of a circular plate of steel (3274.), are in magnetic
relation to each other externally (3257.), then I think the exist
 ence of curved lines of magnetic force must be conceded (3258.
 3263.)*; and if that be granted, then I think that the physical
 nature of the lines must be granted also.             If the external rela
 tion of the   poles  or  polarity  is denied,    then,  as it appears to me,
                                                        ;
 the internal relation must be denied also and with it a vast
 number of old and new facts (3070. &c.) will be left without
 either theory, hypothesis, or even a vague supposition to explain
them.
    3298, Perhaps both magnetic attraction and repulsion, in                                                all
 forms and cases, resolve themselves into the differential action

     A glance at this table is sufficient to show that a periodical
increase and decrease of the magnitude of the daily motion takes
place.    Applying the same method as that made use of by Sir
John Herschel in similar cases,                      I
                                     have drawn a curve, which by
regular curvature passes as nearly as possible through the ends
of the single ordinates, and find 1843-5 to be the epoch of the
minimum, and 1848-5 the epoch of the maximum.
     Shortly before the commencement of the series of observations,
a maximum          must have taken place.                   To      ascertain         the epoch   of
this maximum, we will call in the aid of the Göttingen observa
tions. From the Resultaten des Magnetischen Vereins we deduce
the following numbers as expressing the magnitude of the motion
for the single years.

432      Dr. Lamont on the Ten-year Period which exhibits itself
    From this we ascertain                   that a maximum took place in the
year 1817.
   To obtain further data, we must go back to the observations
of Gilpin and Cassini. The former observed from 1786 to 1805
in the meeting-room of the Royal Society in London. Two cir
cumstances, however, oppose the use of his results: first, they
are incomplete, a period of six or seven months in one year being
sometimes omitted; and secondly, the compass which he made
use of does not seem to have been trustworthy.     Gilpin, indeed,
always repeated his observations, in order to lessen as far as pos
sible the insecurity of his readings. We must still, however,
look with some distrust upon results derived from a needle,
which, when caused to oscillate, often deviated eight or ten or
even a greater number of minutes from its former position.
From 1795 to 1805, the solstitial months, June and December,
and the equinoctial months, March and September, are given.
I have set down these, and also the mean of the four months, in

On a Mode of reviving Dormant Impressions on         the Retina.    435
   Had it been my object to give, by means of a periodic function,
the most exact representation possible of the observed numbers,
there would have been no difficulty in choosing such a function.
The labour at present, however, would lead to no useful result.
We first need a much more extensive series of observations.           I
have therefore contented myself with an approximation sufficiently
close to demonstrate the existence of a period.
   It may not be amiss to remark here, that the daily motion, as
shown by me on a former occasion, consists of two portions
altogether different—of a polar wave and an equatorial wave.
In carrying out the subject, it will be in the first place necessary
to separate these portions, by comparing observations made at the
equator with those made in higher latitudes. That both portions
are subject to a contemporaneous increase or decrease does not
appear to me probable.
   I will remark, in conclusion, that the diurnal motion of the
horizontal intensity is also subject to a considerable alteration;
whether of the same period, or that of the declination,          I have
not yet ascertained.      Our observations must be submitted to
various tedious reductions before they are in a state to decide
the above question.

LX.    On a Mode    of reviving  Dormant   Impressions on the Retina.

      MY   DEAR SIR,                                     May 4, 1852.
A”       experiment which      I made   lately on the revival of the
        images formed on the retina by bright objects may be
worth recording.      I have never seen it in any work which haveI
read; and on showing it to some gentlemen much better ac
quainted with this subject than      I am, they regard it as new ; if
not so, my note will do no more harm than taking up a very
small portion of your valuable space.
    1st. Look steadily at a luminous object sufficiently bright to
be borne by the eyes without great inconvenience, then turn the
eyes upon a dark body or dark space: an image of the object
looked at will be seen, a fact familiar to every body. When the
image has completely faded away and is no longer visible, pass
backwards and forwards between the eye and the dark body a
white substance, say a sheet of paper, the image will be imme
diately revived, and may be thus indefinitely reproduced.
   If the light is in the first instance not sufficiently vivid to pro
duce the continued impression on the retina, but is nearly so,

the invisible image may be brought out or first rendered visible
by moving the white object between the eye and the dark body
or dark space looked                  at.
                             The white substance should                                                 be     in   a
situation exposed      light   tothat                               its
                                            whiteness affects the eye,
                                                 so
and not held      shadow.in  After   little practice,     astonishing

 towhat      extent and for how long
               an                          time images may       thus

   2ndly. Reverse the experiment, looking from the bright object
at  white paper, and       dark image

 LXII.    On the Authorship of the Account of the Commercium
     Epistolicum, published in the Philosophical Transactions. By
     Professor DE MoRGAN +.
     Number 342 (Jan. to Feb. 1714–15) of the                                    Philosophical
 IN Transactions, is the celebrated paper headed “An Account
of the Book entituled Commercium Epistolicum...,” which was
translated into Latin and French, the former in the prelimi
maries of the second edition of the Comm. Epist. itself, the latter
in vol. vii. of the Journal Litteraire. This paper has been attributed
to Newton by some; but in England it seems to be generally
supposed that Keill was the author.           Many writers offer no
opinion. , Sir David Brewster says that it is falsely ascribed to
Newton, but without stating any reason beyond the groundless
character of the ascription.   Biot says that it appears to have
been written  by  Newton.    Montucla,  on information received
from England par des notes de bonne main, states that the notes
to the Comm. Epist. are by Newton: this     suspect to be a con   I
fusion between the avowedly new and separate matter of the
second edition, and the running notes in the first. And so the
matter now stands.
    Halley’s letter to Keill of Oct. 3, 1715 (Edleston's Corre
 spondence, &c. p. 184) concerning the French translation, may
be interpreted in favour of the authorship of either Keill or
 Newton; but seems to render it probable that it must have been
one or the other. What we can get from Keill himself amounts
to the following.       In his epistle to John Bernoulli, separately
printedt in 1720, we find “Est etiam ejusdem Commercii Re
censio sive Epitome in Actis Londinensibus edita: Prodierunt et
nostrae Responsiones ad tuas amicorumque tuorum calumnias”
 (p.8): and again, “In Commercio Epistolico ejusque Epitome,
et in aliis scriptis a me editis....”       20).     (p.          In

        On the Account of the Commercium Epistolicum.                   441
about the same age as his friend Dr. Pemberton, with whom he
studied medicine at Paris: Pemberton was born in 1694.                  The
two lived in closest friendship and neighbourhood to the end of
their lives: Pemberton died early in 1771, leaving his books to
Wilson, who lived to publish his friend's course of Chemistry,
with a memoir, and died” himself on Sept. 29 of the same year.
Wilson also describes himself as the friend of Brook Taylor,
and to this    I have Taylor's attestation. In 1722, Wilson pub
lished Pemberton’s answer to his questions about Cotes, Epistola
ad Amicum de Cotesii inventis, with an appendix in 1723 (London,
4to).    In his copy of the first, now in my possession, Taylor
wrote E libris Br. Taylor Ew dono evimii paris amicorum, autoris
D. H. Pemberton, atque editoris D. J. Wilson.               Consequently,
Wilson lived in friendship with at least two, and probably more,
of those who had a direct connexion with the controversy; and
that he was a very good mathematician, a high fluxionist, is
obvious from the letter which Pemberton addressed to him.
Again, his qualifications as an historian of research and accuracy
 are well attested by his sketch of the history of navigation,
written for and published in Robertson's work on that subject,
 and reprinted by Baron Maseres in the fourth volume of the
 Scriptores Logarithmici.         In 1761, as executor of his friend
 Robins, he published some works of the latter, in two octavo
volumes; and at the end of the second volume he added, by way
of appendix to Robins's tracts on the Analyst controversy, a very
elaborate and well-referenced discussion on several points of the
fluxional controversy.        That he should have written this without
 consultation with his most familiar friend Pemberton, or that a
 single point of it capable of difference of opinion should have
 escaped discussion between them, is incredible; and that any
 fact on which Pemberton's memory differed from his own should
 have been repeated over and over again by him without statement
 of the discordance, is still more so. And this most especially as
 to matters in which Newton was personally concerned.                    For
 Pemberton was Newton’s latest editor, the last man with whom
 he advised on matters relating to the great controversy, and who
 must have been on terms of intimate acquaintance with him at
 the very time when the republication of the Comm. Epist., and
 the junction with it of the paper now under discussion, must have
 made many inquire into the authorship of that paper.
    Now Wilson affirms that Newton wrote, not merely the Re
 censio in question, but the Ad Lectorem, and the remarks on
 John Bernoulli's letter which terminate the second edition of
    * See the Notes and Queries, vol. v. pp. 362, 399, Rigaud's Historical
 Essay  on the Principia, p. 107, and Wilson's own discourse on fluxions pre

442           Prof. De Morgan on the Authorship of the
the Comm. Epist. And this not once, but many times; and not
as laying any stress on the assertion of authorship, but just in
the same manner as when he affirms that Maclaurin wrote on
fluxions, or that John Bernoulli’s letter is at page 448 of the
Journal Litteraire: taking                  all
                                   these matters         equally beyond    to     be
controversy.     Nowhere does         hint      doubt upon the sub

into the  very  fabric   Wilson'sof argument,   and could not pos

to the internal evidence.
   The paper, No. 342, was presented          the Royal Society  to                                    in

           Account    of the Commercium Epistolicum.                  443
the three months which are always marked 1714–15: in the
same period of the next year (Feb. 26) Newton wrote the letter
to Conti; and subsequently, in April or May, the Observations
which were printed after Leibnitz's death in Raphson’s history
of fluxions. Between these later productions, published under
Newton's hand, and the anonymous Account, we find, think, a      I
considerable likeness of      of a kind which cannot be made
                           style,
evident except to those who examine the whole. But we also
find many marked similarities of phrase; and it will hardly be
thought likely that Newton, personally engaged with the chief
of his opponents, would pick up the very recent words of a name
less follower. The paging on the left is that of Raphson’s history,
on the right that of the Account.

wanted; but any one who has access to the papers cited can
find them for himself.   For myself, however,        I
                                                  am more moved
by that general similarity of style which cannot be established
by instances, than by special accordances of phraseology. Having
been accustomed to use the Latin translation of the Account,            I
never remarked this similarity until now.
   Throughout the paper in question there is not one compliment
to Newton (except in quotations introduced in proof of assertions),
not one word expressive of admiration, and not one reference to
anything he had done which he might not, in perfect good taste,
have been the author of.      Who could have written thus about
Newton, in 1714, except Newton himself? No one certainly,
champion or assailant, who then put his name to what he wrote.
 Keill and Leibnitz, Taylor and Bernoulli, always          let   us

directly and indirectly, that when they write of Newton, they
 acknowledge an exalted intellect.
   The Latin translator, in one place which has caught my eye,
seems to have been a little inclined to mend the baldness of his
original.   Newton (as                        I
                            believe) writes, “And by this sort of
Railery they are perswading the Germans that Mr. Newton wants
Judgment, and was not able to invent the Infinitesimal Method.”
The Latin has                it,
                   “Atque hujusmodi cavillationibus, homines                                                   hi
conterraneis suis persuasum esse cupiunt judicio eum       acumine                              et
parum valere; neque eum esse qui Methodum Infinitesimalem
rem tam arduam invenire potuisset.”
   Throughout the paper Newton        “Mr. Newton,” never “Sir
                                                            is

LXIII.   On the supposed Identity of the Agent concerned in the
   Phaenomena of ordinary Electricity, Voltaic Electricity, Electro
   magnetism, Magneto-electricity, and Thermo-electricity.        By
   M. DoNov    AN,  Esq., M.R.I.A.

                             SECTION   V.
HAYºº           now discussed the subject of the last section as
        fully as seemed necessary, I proceed to a most important
branch of the investigation, one that is immediately connected
with the preceding. The instantaneous charge which a large
Leyden battery receives, by a momentary contact with an ex
tensive voltaic series, has been always adduced as an argument
in support of the affirmed enormous quantity of electricity which
constitutes the voltaic current. The phaenomenon when first
discovered made a powerful impression on the minds of philo
sophers, and a strong conviction has been the result.         I never
was able to participate in this conviction; and the first circum
stance which raised my doubts was the feebleness of the shock
which a Leyden battery so charged is capable of communicating,
when compared with that given by the voltaic series with which
the Leyden battery was charged.          Many years since, Sir H.
Davy induced me to take the shock of a Leyden battery charged
by a voltaic battery of one thousand pairs of zinc and copper,
each four inches square, then newly constructed for the Royal
Dublin Society: the shock was insignificant, and the spark
trivial. Accident afterwards gave me the shock of the thousand
pairs; it was the most tremendous sensation that can be con
ceived, and nearly prostrated me.
   There are several accounts extant of the charge communicated
by voltaic series to Leyden batteries; but many of the trials were
made with dry piles, or water batteries, or the contact of the
Leyden battery with the voltaic series was still maintained at the
moment of the discharge; such trials therefore do not afford the
kind of information here required. There are however other
experiments on record relative to this subject, which supply
materials for strong arguments.
    Van Marum charged a Leyden battery of twenty-five jars,
containing a coated surface of 1374 square feet, by a momentary
connexion with a pile consisting of 200 pairs of silver coins and
zinc discs one inch and a half in diameter.         It was charged to
the exact same tension as the      pile itself, which was such as to
occasion a divergence of the gold leaves of Bennet's electrometer
to the extent of five-eighths of an inch. The result was the
same in many experiments.         The shock given by the Leyden

446          Mr. M. Donovan on the supposed Identity of the Agent
battery so charged, “extended to the shoulders with much force;”
but they “had not however the same force as those of the pile
from which they had been charged.” He estimated the force of
the shock given by the Leyden battery, when charged by the
200 pairs, as equal to the shock of 100 pairs when taken directly
from the pile itself; that                           is,          all

the Teylerian Museum (not the large one); and after many ex

   It  appears, however, that the shock from this immense Leyden
battery must have been very small. Those who have had expe
rience   ofpiles, are aware                          of

tion of Van Marum’s machine to occupy half the time, the
quantity thrown in during the six contacts would amount to a
single one-inch spark. Indeed the divergence of the gold-leaf
electrometer, connected with the Leyden battery, seems to have
indicated a very low intensity, since it amounted to no more than
five-eighths of an inch, an effect which would be doubled by the
approach of a bit of excited sealing-wax, without any battery.
It is quite plain therefore that the shock given by the Leyden
battery must have been a very small one.
    It is well known that the shock of the pile is remarkable for
extending        its
                 influence but short way along the arms;

                                     Davy's statement             this account
                                                                             is   on
 the most valuable.       He used the enormous power                2000 pairs       of
of   zinc and copper, each plate exposing 32 superficial inches                                          of
 metal  to   the exciting liquid; the total surface being 128.000
 square inches.        The shock from such                battery would a                                be
 dreadful,      not fatal:

 inferred from Sir             H.
                              Davy's   expression,   that “on making the
 proper connexion (with the hands), either                shock         a spark           or   a
 could     be
            perceived.”       Thus the shock was merely perceptible;
 and this   corresponds     with my recollection                        of
                                                           the shock from                                a
 battery charged               by
                           1000 pairs: Volta himself represents the
 shock     as
            sensible.        appears also that the spark was such that
                               It
it   could      be
                 merely “perceived.”             should  It    observed here  be
 that   any  longer   connexion than         momentary
                                                     a      one,   between the
 Leyden battery and the voltaic series, does not increase the
 charge     ofthe former.

    The trifling nature of the spark is shown strikingly by Mr.
 Gassiot’s experiments: with a nine-gallon Leyden battery,
 charged by 1024 pairs of plates, that gentleman could only pro
ject a spark to a distance of rºodth of an inch.
    In support of the inference here drawn of the very trifling
 nature of the shock, and the inconsiderable quantity of electri
 city which a Leyden battery is capable of communicating, when
 charged by a voltaic series,                    I
                                     shall detail an experiment lately
 made in the   laboratory  of the  Royal   Dublin Society, by Professor
 E. Davy and me. We used twenty Wedgwood-ware troughs,
 each containing ten cells; the number of plates was therefore
 200 of zinc and the same of copper, each plate presenting a sur
 face of 20 square inches on each side.           The exciting liquid in
 each trough consisted of 140 ounces of water, 3} ounces of con
 centrated sulphuric acid, 13 ounce of nitric acid, and the same
 of muriatic acid,          all
                        taken       measure.by    When the battery was
 connected and put       action, the polar wires, armed with charcoal
                             in
 terminations, were brought         contact. An instantaneous burst
                                            in
    light,    dazzling splendour, announced that the battery was
in of
              of
    high action. Having removed the charcoal terminations, we
 connected the polar wires with the inside and outside coatings
 of a  Leyden battery      six jars, the total coated surface
                                  of                                  which                   of
 amounted         to
                12+  square  feet, and after two        three moments   or                              of
contact, applied       discharging rod; but there was not the
                            a
slightest spark; nor were several repetitions               the experiment  of
attended          by
                any  better success.     Having     established the con
nexions       as
             before, we tried         obtain to  shock from the Leyden
                                                                   a
battery when       was detached, but neither
                       it                                              of

    subsequent trial      the cylinder, made immediately after the

Thus the capability of the Leyden battery to manifest the pre
sence of three one-inch sparks was proved; it was also proved
that 200 pairs of plates did not communicate so much ; and as
six revolutions of the cylinder imparted to the Leyden battery
such a quantity of electricity as gave a sensible shock, that shock
was proved to be virtually occasioned by             one-inch sparks.                six

 450         Mr. M. Donovan on the supposed Identity of the Agent
circuit. The polar wires are in contact with the two coatings of
the jars; the two coatings are therefore now the real polar con
ductors, notwithstanding their extensive surface; but they are not
in contact, for they are surrounded on          sides        insuperable          all            by      an
barrier     glass; they are

tensity of a Leyden battery will kill an animal; but reconvert that
intensity into quantity by causing the animal to draw off the
charge by a sharp point, and no sensation will be experienced.
If then intensity be thus proved to be the effective condition for
giving the shock and spark, how is the fact reconcileable with
the violent one which may be taken from a voltaic series in which
the electric intensity is of the most feeble character?

452         Mr. M. Donovan on                     the supposed         Identity         of the Agent
cumstances         of the chemical action now taking place, the result
of which      I   conceive to be an alteration in the constitution of that
agent.   The cause or manner of this alteration am no more                                  I
able to assign  than the supporters of the common hypothesis are
to explain the difference between tension and current by the
agency of quantity. The difference of properties between common
and voltaic electricity is nevertheless so obvious, to                                      a all

just   as  itdid before the connexion.              Ordinary electricity only                                            is

rative   oftheir views, seems unaccountable, when they                    the same

       concerned in the Phaenomena                   of ordinary Electricity,           &c.           453
time affirm that the current of electricity is only called into action
when the circuit is closed, which is not the case in the instance
under consideration.
   Beside the foregoing objections against adducing the Leyden
battery in support of the alleged efficiency of quantity to explain
the difference between voltaic and ordinary electric phaenomena,
it may be worth while to make some further animadversions.
   Various opinions have prevailed with regard to the nature of
electricity: some suppose that it is an imponderable transferable
elastic fluid; others that it consists of two such fluids; others
that it is not a transferable elastic fluid, but vibrations of a sta
tionary fluid; while others maintain that there is no fluid, and
refer the phaenomena to molecular vibrations of the electrified
substance.
   Be this as it may, those who believe in the existence of an
elastic fluid, or two such, have explained electrical phaenomena
by positive and negative electricity. The passage of one or two
electric fluids from one body to or through another, is called a
current, and the idea of a current naturally enough involves the
idea of quantity.   It is thus that we talk familiarly of the enor
mous quantity of electricity which must circulate in a current,
 and which in an instant communicates a charge to a Leyden
battery. All this is very intelligible, although not satisfactory,
provided that such a fluid does really exist and that it flows in a
current, but no one has ever been able to prove these conditions.
In fine, when a Leyden battery is charged, we have no knowledge
of     its
         being filled with anything;                       all
                                                    conjecture: but

   Thus a wire of zinc and a wire of platinum can be made to
 give“a violent shock which can scarcely be borne,” although they
will give absolutely no signs of electricity to the most delicate
electrometer.    Can that shock then depend on electricity ?                                                         It
is hard to conceive a more persuasive fact in support of the
position already advanced, that there are other kinds of shocks,
or at least one other kind, beside an electric shock.       Can it be
believed that two bits of wire can thus evolve such a powerful
charge of electricity as to give so tremendous a shock; and that

    All these facts, and many others which could be adduced, seem
to render it highly probable, if not to prove, that the peculiar
sparks and shocks occasioned by voltaic series are caused by an
agent of a different nature from that which produces ordina
electrical phaenomena. And further, reasons in my opinion suf
ficient, have been assigned for doubting the force of the evidence
derived from the so-called immediate charge of a Leyden battery
by a voltaic series, as proving the vast quantity of electricity
which constitutes the voltaic current, and the identity of the
agent in        all
            electrical and voltaic phaenomena.

he states, as the first proposition to be proved, that lºw, which is
obviously           a   rational function of a, must further admit of being
expressed rationally by the coefficients of ba and 6a. He then
substitutes 6"a for a in the expression for lºr, and combining

the general reader, it may be remarked by way of setting foot

third degree inclusive.

History of Physical Astronomy, from the earliest Ages to the middle
   of the Nineteenth Century. By Rob ERT GRANT, F.R.A.S. Lon
   don: Baldwin. 8vo. (pp. 635.)
Abº.         eighteen months ago, in the continuation of the Library
       of Useful Knowledge undertaken by Mr. Baldwin, appeared
the first number of a History of Physical Astronomy, by one Robert
Grant, who was then wholly unknown.         To write history on this
subject was an attempt of the most ambitious kind; first, because no
connected and consecutive history had ever been written; secondly,
because such a thing would require a large amount of mathematical
reading of the highest order; and thirdly, because the historical
materials exist in great part among the long series of memoirs of aca
demies, which are not very easy to get at, and are very troublesome to
master. We say nothing of the many questions which demand the
highest judgement; because we are speaking only of the difficulties
which no amount of self-confidence could ignore or even materially
underrate.     It was, we have no doubt, to these difficulties that the want
 of such a   history  was due : and we think it probable that many took
 up the first number of the work before us with the impression that
 the genius of book-making must have been very hard put to it for
 materials, before he could have suggested the theory of gravitation,
 its mathematical aspect inclusive, as a subject of history for a popu
lar series.     But it was found, on examination, that the work bore
 evident marks of original reading, high mathematical knowledge,
sound judgement, and careful writing: and it made some sensation
in the astronomical world, that there should be any person in the
country who had so mastered the subject, without first becoming
known by some minor effort, in the usual way. During the publi
cation of the numbers, Mr. Grant's name, which had at first been
“spelt by th' unletter'd muse,” acquired the four suffixes which stand
at the head of our article.      And the work is now as well established
among the greater efforts of scientific history, as it could have been
if the author had been previously known, and it had been waited for
with the usual amount of announcement and previous discussion of
its  probable character.     And, though      includes some subjects which
proceed by the highest mathematics,         it it nevertheless very popular
                                                    is
in  its requirements   from the reader. On this point Mr. Grant would
                  high  commendation, though          had been only com

piler.       seems that the
            It                plan  was at first     limited character, but
                                                         of
that  it  expanded    during  the execution.     To this         due that the
                                                                      it   is

did not exist any connected history         ofthe whole theory        gravita   of

tion. The extent to which the subject is treated by Montucla is
rather what might have been expected in a general history of mathe
matics than what is due to the subject.               Still less can we find any
thing consecutively historical, and reaching to our own time, on the
matters which constitute what is properly called physical astronomy.
   Astronomy ought to be divided into geometrical, mechanical, and
physical.     To the first belongs                         all

   Friday, April 2, 1852.-On the Blackheath Pebble-bed, and on
certain Phaenomena in the Geology of the Neighbourhood of London.
By Sir Charles Lyell.
  There are two kinds of flint-gravel used for making roads in the
neighbourhood of London, both of them in certain places superficial,
but which are of extremely different ages. The yellow gravel of
Hyde Park and Kensington, so often found covering the “Iondon
Clay” may be taken as an example of one kind; that of Blackheath,
of the other. The first of these             is,
                                     comparatively speaking,     very            of
modern date, and consists     slightly rolled, and, for the most part,
                                       of
angular fragments,      inwhich portions       the white opake coating
                                                   of                                   of
the original chalk flint remain unremoved. The more ancient gravel
consists   ofblack and well-rounded pebbles, egg-shaped           spherical,
                                                                       or

                                                    white chalk sometimes
occur, though very rarely intermixed with the pebbles.                 If
                                                                   we meet
with thoroughly rounded flints             the more modern,

                        of                         Condamine have shown

species, such as Cyrena cuneiformis, &c., agreeing with fossils which
characterize the Lower Eocene beds at Woolwich.                    At Lewisham
the   pebble-bed  passes   under the London        Clay,   and at Shooter's Hill
this clay overlies it in great thickness.
    At New Charlton, in the suburbs of Woolwich, Mr. De la Conda
mine discovered a few years ago a layer of sand in the midst of the
pebble-bed, where numerous individuals of the Cyrena tellinella
were seen standing endwise, with both their valves united, the pos
terior extremity of each shell being uppermost, as would happen if
the mollusks had died in their natural position.               Sir Charles Lyell
described a bank of      sandy  mud in the delta of the Alabama river at
Mobile, on the borders of the Gulf of Mexico, where, in 1846, he
had dug out, at low tide, specimens of a living species of Cyrena,
and of a Gnathodon, which were similarly placed, with their shells
erect, a position which enables the animal to protrude                      siphons                     its
upwards, and draw                                      gills, and reject  its

usually fresh, but sometimes brackish.            Sir Charles examined lately
the Woolwich beds with Mr. Morris, and they verified Mr. De                                                         la

points where freshwater shells abound, seems                imply the entrance     to                               of

                            Royal Institution.                        475
rivers into the sea, which brought down some flints, and arrested the
progress of others travelling as beach pebbles along a coast line,
in a certain direction determined by the prevailing currents and
winds.     The spreading of the pebble-bed over a wide area may
be accounted for by supposing a gradual subsidence of land, and the
continually shifting of the coast-lines upon which shingle accumulated.
This same subsidence is required to explain the superposition of the
London Clay, a deep-sea deposit to the Blackheath or Woolwich beds
which are of shallow water or littoral origin. One of the rivers of
 the Lower Eocene period swept into the sea at Kyson near Wood
bridge in Suffolk the bones of a monkey of the genus Macacus, of a
marsupial quadruped allied to the opossum, of a Hyracotherium,
and other mammalia, which have been determined by Professor
Owen, and which throw light on the inhabitants of the land, at an
aera antecedent to the deposition of the London Clay.
    Sir C. Lyell then exhibited some sections, recently published by
Mr. Prestwich *, illustrative of the geology of the environs of London,
and gave a rapid sketch of the successive Eocene groups from the
London Clay and overlying Bagshot series with its nummulites to
the Barton and Hampshire freshwater formations with their fossil
quadrupeds.      He then alluded to the tertiary strata next in the
ascending order which he had recently studied in Limburg, Belgium,
which are not represented in England, and next to the Miocene
faluns of Touraine and the Pliocene strata or crag of Suffolk, and
lastly to the still more modern glacial period and the brick-earth
of the valley of the Thames. The last-mentioned formation contains
the bones of extinct quadrupeds mingled with shells    - of recent species,
terrestrial and fluviatile.
   The numerous and important changes in the fauna of the globe,
attested by these successive assemblages of extinct species, belonging
to different tertiary aeras, attest the vast lapse of ages which separate
the time when the freshwater beds of Woolwich and Blackheath were
formed from the human period.         But revolutions of another and no
less striking kind have taken place contemporaneously in the physi
cal geography of the northern hemisphere, revolutions on so great a
scale that the greater part of the present continents of Europe, Asia,
Northern Africa and North America with which the geologist is
best acquainted, have come into existence in the interval of time
here alluded to. It may also be confidently affirmed that the colos
sal chain of the Alps is more modern than the tertiary shingle of
Blackheath.     There was deep sea at the period when the London
Clay was forming, precisely in the area where the loftiest mountains
of Europe now rise into the regions of perpetual snow. In proof
of this the Lecturer referred to the works of several modern geolo
gists, especially to those of Sir Roderick Murchison, and to a Lecture
delivered by Sir Roderick in the Royal Institution to show that the
nummulitic formation which belongs to the Eocene period, and not
to the very oldest part of that period, attains an elevation in some

portions of the Swiss Alps of 8000 or even 10,000 feet, and enters
into the structure and composition even of the central axis of the
Alps, having been subject to the same movements and partaking of
the same foldings and contortions as the underlying cretaceous and
oolitic strata.
    Sir Charles Lyell next proceeded to show that a great series of
volcanic eruptions had occurred in Europe since the older Eocene
strata of the neighbourhood of London were deposited. Not only
Vesuvius and Somma as well as Etna and the extinct volcanoes of
 Southern Sicily, but the trachytic and basaltic eruptions of the ex
tinct volcanoes of central France are more modern than the London
Clay. The evidence consists not only of the superposition of igneous
rocks several thousand feet thick, to lacustrine strata of the middle
and upper Eocene periods, but also to the absence in the pebble-beds
constituting the base of the tertiary series of Auvergne, Cantal, and
Velay of any pebbles of volcanic origin.
    The Lecturer concluded by stating that the formation of every
mountain chain and every elevation and depression of land bears
 witness to internal changes at various depths in the earth's crust.
 The alteration has consisted sometimes of the expansion, and
 sometimes of the contraction of rock, or of the semi-liquefaction
 or complete fusion of stony masses and their injection into rents of
 the fractured crust occasionally manifested by the escape of lava
 at the surface. Every permanent alteration therefore of level may
 be regarded as the outward sign of much greater internal revo
 lutions taking place simultaneously far below.          Even the precise
 nature of the changes in the texture of rocks produced by subterra
 nean heat and other plutonic influences since the commencement of
 the Eocene period can be detected in a few spots, especially in the
 central axis of the Alps, where the disturbing agency had been in
 tense. The table might be covered with specimens of gneiss, mica
 schist and quartz rock, once called primitive, and once supposed to
 be of a date anterior to the creation of living beings, which never
 theless were sedimentary strata of the Eocene period which assumed
 their crystalline form after the flints of Llackhea'h were rolled into
 shingle, and even after the shells of the London Clay and the num
 mulites of the overlying Bagshot sands were in existence.
    Yet however remote may be the antiquity of the Blackheath pebble
 bed as demonstrated by the vast amount of subsequent change in
 physical geography, in the internal structure of the earth's crust and
 in the revolutions in organic life since experienced,      as its
                                                              origin  pro

                                         of    the Chalk     from our own
 times. For the fossils of the Chalk differ as much from those of the
 oldest tertiary strata near London,    as   do  the last from the organic
 beings of    the present aera.  Nevertheless the white Chalk itself with
 its  flints is   considered by every geologist   as  the production

           ON    THE PASSIVE STATE or METEORIC                  IRON.
I
                         BY PROF. woh LER.
    HAVE    observed the remarkable fact that the greater portion of the
                              I
   meteoric iron which have had the opportunity of examining, is in
the so-called passive state, that is to say, that it does not reduce the
copper from a solution of neutral sulphate of copper, but remains
bright and uncoppered on immersion therein. But if touched in the
solution with a piece of common iron, the reduction of the copper
commences immediately upon the meteoric iron.            It also becomes
active instantaneously on the addition of a drop of acid to the solu
tion of copper; but if the reduced copper be filed away, the new sur
face is again passive; indeed I was unable by filing away to pro
duce an active or reducing surface on any passive meteoric iron.         I
convinced myself by experiments on meteomic iron, which had never
been in contact with nitric acid and nevertheless was passive, that
this state could not have been produced by the corrosion of the sur
face by the acid for the production of the Widmanstätteen figures.
    I thought at first that this deportment might be employed as a
means of distinguishing true meteoric iron; but it soon appeared
that some undoubtedly genuine meteoric iron was not in this state.
In this respect I have observed the following differences:—
    The Pallas iron, the iron which fell at Braumau in 1847, that of
 Schwetz, Bohumilitz, Toluca, Green County (N. America), Red
River, and that from the Cape of Good Hope, are passive.
    The iron from Lenarto, Chester County, Rasgata, Mexico, Senegal
and Bitburg (the latter forged), is active or reducing.
    Between the two stands the iron from Agram, Arva, Atacama and
Burlington (N. America), which do not become coated with copper
immediately, but on which the reduction gradually commences after
a longer or shorter contact with the cupreous solution, and usually
from one point or from the margins of the fluid.
    These peculiarities appear to have no connexion either with the
presence of nickel or the property of forming regular figures on cor
rosion, as is shown by the iron from Lenarto, which is active, although
it contains 8:45 per cent. of nickel and 0.66 of cobalt, and exhibits
 the most beautiful figures on corrosion, and also by the iron brought
 by Boussingault from Rasgata in Columbia, which, according to my
 analysis contains 3-74 per cent. of nickel and 0.23 of cobalt.        On
 the other hand, the iron from Green County, which is completely
 passive, contains 19 per cent. of nickel and exhibits no figures.
    I also found that an artificially prepared alloy of iron and nickel,
 which on corrosion acquired a damasked surface, reduced the copper
 from solution in the same manner as common iron.

                          To R. Taylor, Esq.
      DEAR SIR,
    Had your correspondent, Mr. Elliot, attended to the original date
of my first memoir on Binocular Vision, reprinted in the Philo
sophical Magazine for April last, he would have seen that there was
no ground for impugning the originality of my researches.         That
paper was read at the Royal Society in June 1830, fourteen years
ago, and published in the Philosophical Transactions.      The subject
was brought forward in September of the same year at the Meeting
of the British Association at Newcastle, where it excited considerable
interest, and was fully noticed in consequence thereof in the
Athenaeum, Literary Gazette, and other public journals; my Ste
reoscope also at that time was made and sold by the principal op
ticians in London.    Whatever instrument Mr. Elliot made thirteen
years ago was therefore made after my experiments had received ex
tensive publicity.
                                       Yours very truly,
     King's College,                               C. WHEATstone.
     May 2nd, 1852.
    [We have, since the publication of our last Number, received a note
from Mr. Elliot, stating, that had he been aware that Prof. Wheat
stone had produced his Stereoscope so early as 1838, he would not
have sent the statement inserted therein.—EDIToR.]
 ON   THE   SUNColum N As SEEN AT SANDwick MANSE, or KNEy,
               IN APRIL 1852. By c. CLouston.
  The perpendicular column of light which appeared repeatedly at
sunset and sunrise during April, deserves a more particular account
than the usual monthly report contains, as this is the most northern
locality in which      I
                      have yet heard of            its
                                               appearance.

                                         it generally   immediately after the
sun had sunk either below the horizon,                   or

     LXIX.     On  the Heat disengaged in Chemical Combinations,
                 By JAMEs PREscott Joule, F.R.S.
     To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
           following memoir was communicated to the French
THE      Academy several years ago*, in order to compete for the
prize offered for the best essay on the heat of chemical combi
nations. Owing to my not having been aware of the regulations
to be observed by the competitors, and to the delay in procuring
a good translation, my paper was deemed ineligible, but was
referred to the Commission appointed to examine the memoirs
presented on the same subject.         The time has now arrived when
I  feel that I ought not to delay communicating the results of a
laborious investigation to the scientific world, and I therefore
transmit to you an exact copy of the paper from which the
French translation, now in the possession of the Academy of
Sciences, was made.        The necessity of making no alterations
whatever in the     paper has prevented me from citing additional
authorities, and making sundry small corrections which have
occurred to me since it was written.          I will therefore avail my
self of the  opportunity   of making    a few prefatory observations.
    I would   remark,  in the first place,  that the laws of the disen
gagement of heat by voltaic electricity received, nearly at the
same time that the experiments contained in my paper were
made, a new confirmation and important developments by the
researches of Professor J. D. Botto of Turin.             This valuable
contribution to physical science will be found in the Memoirs of
the Academy of Sciences of Turin, 2nd series, vol. viii.          In the
Bulletin des Sciences of the Berlin Academy for the 25th of No
vember 1848, will also be found an able memoir on the same
subject by Professor Poggendorff.

            I have learned        from Professor Thomson that the length of the
 needle of                 my galvanometer is so small in comparison with the
 diameter of the coil, that no sensible error could have arisen from
 taking the tangents of the deflections as the measure of the cur
 rents traversing the coil. The amount of the correction that I have
 applied               is,
             however, too trifling    affect materially the numerical  to
 results arrived                       at.

484                  Mr.      J.    P. Joule         on the   Heat disengaged
     Inthe year 1840*                I
                           commenced experiments on the calorific
effects of voltaic electricity, having at that time no knowledge of
what Riess had previously done in frictional electricity.       By
these experiments it was proved, that when a current of voltaic
electricity is propagated along a metallic conductor, the heat
                                                                        º
evolved thereby in a given time is proportional to the resistance
of the wire and the square of the quantity of electricity trans
mitted.
   Pursuing the inquiry, I found that the law applied very well
to liquid conductors; and hence I inferred that the heat evolved
by any voltaic pile is proportional to intensity   electromotiveits                     or
force, and the number                of
                            chemical equivalents electrolysed       each                               in

                                inwords,   proportional     the intensity                to
of  the pile and the quantity     transmitted electricityt.

   The above law must          understood be     hold good only when    to

                                                or     for       obvious                     it   is
that the heat evolved                    by
                             any action not                         pro                                in

confounded with that due                the direct and useful action of
                                                    to

nitude of the resistance to conduction and the square of the
quantity of transmitted electricity.
   2nd. That the resistance to electrolysis presented by water does
not occasion the evolution of heat in the decomposing cell.        At
the same   time, the heat evolved  by  the whole circuit, for a given
quantity of transmitted electricity, is diminished on account of
the decreased electromotive force of the current, owing to the
resistance to electrolysis.  It is reasonable to infer that this di
minution of the heat evolved by the circuit is occasioned by the
absorption of heat in the decomposing cell.
   And 3rd. That the resistance occasioned by the polarization of
Ritter occasions the evolution of heat at the surfaces on which
this phaenomenon takes place; and thus it happens that the
diminution of the heat evolved by the circuit, in consequence of
the diminished intensity of the pile, is exactly compensated for;
so that the heat evolved by the whole circuit may be estimated
by the chemical changes occurring in the pile, just as if no such
polarization existed.
  I have already given theoretical results+ for the heat of com
                                   º
bustion agreeing so well with the experiments of Dulong, as to
convince me of the accuracy of the principles above advanced.
My method was to ascertain how much of the intensity of a pile
is spent in overcoming the          of the combustible for oxygen,
and then to calculate the heat due to such an intensity, which
heat ought, on our principles, to be equal to the heat occasioned
by the recombination of the elements in combustion.      I hope in
the present paper to be able to show that still more accurate
results may be attained by the use of a method, founded upon
the same principles, but of greater simplicity.   Previously, how
ever, to the description of the new experiments, I intend to bring
forward some new proofs of the correctness of the law upon
which their accuracy entirely depends.
  I   am aware that M. Ed. Becquerelt and M. Lenzi have sepa
rately, and by numerous and skilfully performed experiments,
made it abundantly clear that the heat evolved by voltaic elec
tricity is proportional to the resistance to conduction and the
square of the current.    Nevertheless I have made new experi
ments upon the subject, thinking it impossible to demonstrate
too completely the accuracy of a law upon which            thermo     all
chemical phaenomena depend.      have endeavoured
                                        I               make the      to

  By comparing the last two columns of the foregoing table
with each other, we see that throughout a very extensive range
of electric intensities the heat evolved in a given time remains
proportional to the square of the quantity of transmitted elec
tricity.
     dºining   thus succeeded in giving another proof of the law
of voltaic heat as far as regards a change in the intensity of the
current, we may now proceed to consider the effects produced
by a change in the resistance of the wire. It will not be neces
sary for me to enter very largely upon this part of the subject,
inasmuch as it has long been admitted by philosophers that the
heat evolved by a current of given intensity is proportional to
the resistance of the wire.      I will, however, give one series of
experiments, in which I have compared a wire of mercury with
the coil of silver wire used in the previous experiments.          The
comparison of a fluid with a solid metal was, I thought, emi
nently calculated to test the accuracy of the law.
   A glass tube, 157 centimetres long and about 2.3 millimetres
in internal diameter, was fashioned into a spiral, as represented

   On multiplying 0-74964 by 2:7397, the square of the inten
sity of the current to which the mercury wire was exposed (see
Table III.), we obtain 2:0538, a quantity which ought to be
proportional to the heat evolved, if our law be correct.    From
Table III. we see also, that, in the case of the silver wire, the
square of the current multiplied by    resistance (which    called    its                                   we

                                 then ascertain the resistance of
a wire capable of obstructing the current equally with the elec
trolytic cell. Then, by the law we have proved,    determine the                I
quantity of heat which would have been evolved had a wire of
such resistance been placed in the circuit instead of the electro
lytic cell:..this theoretical quantity, being compared with the
heat actually evolved in the electrolytic cell, is always found to
exceed the latter considerably.   The difference between the two
results evidently gives the quantity of heat absorbed during the
electrolysis, and is therefore equivalent to the heat which is due
to the reverse chemical combination by combustion or other
means.
  Having thus given a short outline of the process,                                    I   shall   at

     Itook a glass jar, fig. 6, filled with 3 lbs. of a solution con
sisting of 24 parts of water, 7 parts of crystallized sulphate of
copper, and 1 part of strong sulphuric acid.          In this solution,
two  plates, one of platinum,    the other of copper,  were immersed,
each   being connected by means of a proper clamp with a thick
copper wire passing through a cork in the mouth of the vessel,
and terminating in a mercury cup a. A very delicate thermo

centre of the liquid.   Lastly, a glass stirrer b was introduced.
   The experiments were conducted in the following manner:—A

coil     of
          silver wire (immersed       water     inkeep    cool) was put

the former observations taken, so as to obviate the effects of any
change that might be occurring in the intensity of the pile.
   The temperature of the solution was observed, with the usual
precautions, immediately before and after the electrolysis was
carried on. The amount of electrolysis was obtained by weigh
ing the negative copper electrode before and after each expe
riment.

the experiments were made, it was necessary to supply the second
correction given in the above tables, on account of the capacity
for heat of the jars being necessarily somewhat different from
what it was in the experiments of Tables W. and VI. In Table VI.
the can contained 2 lbs. 12 oz. of water, and the coil of silver
wire; whereas it contained 2 lbs. 11 oz. and the coil of merc
in Table VIII. Again, in the experiments of Table W. there
were 3 lbs. of solution of copper along with the platinum and
copper electrodes; whereas in those of Table VII. the mercury coil
was substituted for the electrodes, whilst the weight of the solu
tion was two grammes less than before.        It would be tedious
and   unnecessary  to give in detail the various reductions de
manded by these circumstances; suffice it to say, that the cal
culations were founded upon the best tables of specific heat, and
were made with the most scrupulous care.

the coil of silver wire and 2 lbs. 12 oz. of water, was found by
careful calculations to be equivalent in      capacity for heat        its                                  to

equal to one degree of the Centigrade scale, we obtain for the
       -                     A–C

The quantity of heat actually evolved will be
                    ... x 1179.2=963°.99.
Subtracting the latter from the former result, we obtain 491°3
as the quantity of heat absorbed in the electrolysis of a quantity
of sulphate of copper corresponding to 0:5874 of a gramme of
copper.     The quantity of heat absorbed per gramme of- copper
deposited will therefore be 836°4.
   Two other series of experiments conducted in precisely the
same manner, excepting that in the former of the two the spe
cific heat of the solution was obtained by the method of mixtures,
gave, for the absorption of heat per gramme of copper deposited,
respectively 856° and 796°5.         The mean of the three results
is 829°-6.
    The above quantity of heat is that absorbed in separating the
copper and oxygen gas from a solution of sulphate of oxide of
copper.      It is therefore necessary to subtract the absorption due
to the transfer of the sulphuric acid from the oxide of copper to
water, in order to obtain the heat absorbed in the decomposition
of oxide of copper into metal and oxygen gas. For this purpose,
8 grammes of oxide of copper, prepared by adding potash to a
solution of the sulphate of copper, and then carefully washing
and igniting the precipitate, were thrown into an acidulated
solution of copper similar to that used in the above experiments,
the capacity for heat of which had been previously ascertained.
The mean of four experiments, tried in this way with every pos
sible precaution, gave 236° as the heat due to the solution of
1252 gramme, the quantity of oxide corresponding to a gramme
of copper.
    829°-6–236°=593°6 = the quantity of heat absorbed in
the decomposition of oxide of copper into copper and oxygen
gas, and which ought therefore to be the quantity of heat evolved
by the combustion of a gramme of copper.

    My experiments on this metal were similar to those on copper;
they   will not therefore require a very detailed description.    The

solution employed was one consisting of 3 parts of crystallized
sulphate of zinc and 8 parts of water, weighing 3 lbs. 2 oz. The
electrodes were plates of platinum and zinc, each plate exposing
an active surface of about 8 square inches. At the conclusion of
each experiment, oxide of zinc was thrown into the solution to
replace that removed by electrolysis, in order to prevent the zinc
electrode from being acted upon by free acid.

sorbed during the electrolysis of a quantity of sulphate of water
corresponding to 0.04243 of a gramme of hydrogen.
   The quantity of heat absorbed by the electrolysis of a quantity
of sulphate of water corresponding to a gramme of hydrogen will
therefore be 34101°.
   Two other series of experiments conducted in precisely the
same manner, excepting that in the former of the two the capa
city for heat of the jar of dilute acid was obtained by the method
of mixtures, gave 34.212° and 32358° respectively, as the heat
absorbed per gramme of hydrogen liberated.                                The mean of the
three results is 33557°.
   A small portion of this quantity of heat absorbed is that due
to the removal of water from the dilute acid; but the correction
on this account is so exceedingly small as to be hardly worth

33553°         quantity of heat absorbed during the electrolysis
            as the
of water, which ought therefore to be equal to the quantity of
heat evolved by the combustion of a gramme of hydrogen gas.
   8. By the inverse method of electrical currents, then, we have
found that the quantities of heat evolved by the combustion of
copper, zinc and hydrogen, are respectively 594°, 1185°, and
33553°. These quantities agree so well with the results, ob
tained by Dulong, that       think     I              I
                                      may assume that the principles
admitted in this paper are demonstrated sufficiently to justify
me in making them the basis of a few concluding observations.
   The fact that the heat evolved in a given time by a metallic
wire is proportional to the square of the quantity of transmitted
electricity, proves that the action of the current is of a strictly
mechanical character; for the force exerted by a fluid impinging
against a solid body obeys the same law.       Now      have shown in           I
previous papers+, that when the temperature of a gramme of water
                                                                           byvis
is increased by 1° Centigrade, a quantity of          viva    commu                       is
nicated     to    its
                particles equal    that acquired to     weight     448          a                of
grammes after falling from the perpendicular height
                                                                                     be of
                                                           one metre.
Hence the mechanical force            voltaic pile may
                                                 of   a     calculated

                                 it
   Hence also may the absolute force with which bodies enter

 on the circumstances under which vision naturally occurs, as
 preceding writers on this subject mostly have done, but it is
 necessary to have more extended recourse to the methods so
 successfully employed in experimental philosophy, and to endea
 vour, wherever it be possible, not only to analyse the elements of
 vision, but also to recombine them in unusual manners, so that
 they may be associated under circumstances that never naturally
 occur.
    The instrument            I
                           shall proceed to describe enables these ab
 normal combinations to be made in a very simple and effectual
 manner.      Its principal object is to cause the binocular pictures
 to coincide, with any inclination of the optic axes, while their
 magnitudes on the retinae remain the same; or inversely, while
the optic axes remain at the same angle, to cause the size of the
pictures on the retinae to vary in any manner.
    Two plane mirrors inclined 90° to each other are placed toge
ther and fixed vertically upon a horizontal board.            Two wooden
arms move round a common centre situated on this board in the
vertical plane which bisects the angle of the mirrors, and about
1} inch beyond their line of junction.            Upon each of these arms
is placed   an   upright  pannel,  at  right  angles thereto, for the pur
pose of receiving           its
                          appropriate picture, and each pannel       made            is
to  slide     and from the opposite mirror.
             to                                     The eyes being placed
before the mirrors, the right eye           the right mirror and the left
                                                      to
eye  to  the left mirror,  and the  pannels    being adjusted     the same     to
distances, however the arms                      be
                                         moved round their centre, the
distance     ofthe reflected image        each picture from the eye will
                                                  of
remain exactly the same, and consequently its retinal magnitude
will    be unchanged.       But             as
                                      the two reflected images          not              do
occupy the same place when the pictures are different positions,  in
to cause the former    coincide the optic axes must converge
                                  to
differently. When the arms are        the same straight line, the
                                                      in
images coincide while the optic axes are parallel; and        they                   as
form   aless angle with each other, the optic axes converge  more
to occasion the coincidence.   When the arms remain      the same              in
positions, while the pannels slide towards         from the mirrors, the
                                                             or
convergence        of
                   the  optic  axes remains the   same, but the magni

                             the retinae increases     the distance de

whilst it apparently increases or decreases, in consequence of the
inclination of the optic axes varying while the magnitude of the
impressions on the retinae remains the same, it does not appear
either to approach or to recede; and yet if we attentively regard
it in any fixed position, it is perceived to be at a different distance.
On the other hand, if we continue to regard the binocular pic

retinal magnitude while the convergence of the axes remains the

   Leaving this subject,              I      will now revert                to   the stereoscope and
its effects.
   Since 1838 numerous modifications              the stereoscope have  of

been  proposed            by
                     Sir David Brewster and Professor Dove; but

      I
    have, for many years past, employed also another means to
occasion, without any straining of the eyes, the coincidence of
the pictures so that the image in relief shall appear of the same
magnitude and at the same distance as the object which they
represent would do if it were itself directly regarded.          In this
apparatus, prisms being employed to deflect the rays of light
proceeding from the pictures, so as to make them appear to
occupy the same place, I have called it the refracting stereoscope.
   It is represented by fig. 4. It consists of a base 6 inches
long and 4 inches broad, upon which stands an upright partition,
5 inches high, dividing it equally; this partition is capable of
extension by means of a slide to double the length, and carries

                                    §   19.
    At the date of the publication of my experiments on binocular
vision, the brilliant photographic discoveries of Talbot, Niepce
and Daguerre, had not been announced to the world. To illus
trate the phaenomena of the stereoscope            I
                                              could therefore, at that
time, only employ drawings made by the hands of an artist.
Mere outline figures, or even shaded perspective drawings of
simple objects, do not present much difficulty; but it is evidently
impossible for the most accurate and accomplished artist to deli
neate, by the sole aid of his eye, the two projections necessary to
form the stereoscopic relief of objects as they exist in nature with
their delicate differences of outline, light and shade. What the
hand of the artist was unable to accomplish, the chemical action
of light, directed by the camera, has enabled us to effect.
    It was at the beginning of 1839, about six months after the
 appearance of my memoir in the Philosophical Transactions, that
the photographic art became known, and soon after, at my request,
 Mr. Talbot, the inventor, and Mr. Collen (one of the first culti
 vators of the art) obligingly prepared for me stereoscopic Talbo
 types of full-sized statues, buildings, and even portraits of living
persons.                                  I
              M. Quetelet, to whom communicated this application
 and sent specimens, made mention of it in the Bulletins of the
 Brussels Academy of October 1841. To M. Fizeau and M. Claudet
I   was indebted for the first Daguerreotypes executed for the
 stereoscope.    The beautiful stereoscopic representations of sta
 tuary, architecture, machinery, natural history specimens, por
 traits of living persons, single and in groups, &c., which have
 recently been produced by M. Soleil and M. Claudet, are now
 too well known to the public to need more than a slight refer
                               -
 ence to them.
    With respect to the means of preparing the binocular photo
 graphs (and in this general term         I
                                       include both Talbotypes and
 Daguerreotypes), little requires to be said beyond a few direc
 tions as to the proper positions in which it is necessary to place
 the camera in order to obtain the two required projections.
    We will suppose that the binocular pictures are required to
be   seen   in the stereoscope at a distance of 8 inches before the
eyes,   in which   case the convergenceof the optic axes is about 18°.
To obtain the    proper  projections  for this distance, the camera
must be   placed,   with      its
                             lens  accurately   directed towards the
object, successively   intwo points           of
                                        the circumference           of

                                                                     a

512              Prof. Wheatstone on the Physiology                                     of Vision.
of whic<U+017F> the object is the centre, and the points at which the
camera is so placed must have the angular distance of 18° from
each other, exactly that of the optic axes in the stereoscope.
The distance of the camera from the object may be taken arbi
trarily; for, so long     as the same angle is employed, whatever
that distance may be, the pictures will exhibit in the stereoscope
the same relief, and be seen at the same distance of 8 inches,
only the magnitude of the picture will appear different. Minia
ture stereoscopic representations          of buildings and full-sized
statues are therefore obtained merely by taking the two projec
tions of the object from a considerable distance, but at the same                                        is,

abnormally, and to cause any degree of inclination of the axes to
coexist with any dissimilarity of the two pictures. To ascertain

8 inches.    The effect of a pair of near projections seen with a

the object itself is reflected in a mirror, or inverted. The reason
is this; that in the former cases the projections to each eye are
separately reflected or inverted, still remaining presented to the
same eye, whereas, by the reflexion or inversion of the object
itself, not only are the projections reflected or inverted, but they
are also transposed from one eye to the other; and these cir
cumstances occurring simultaneously reproduce the normal relief.

with the angle nearest the eyes, so that they may be adjusted
that their bases may have any inclination towards each other;
and the frame itself is adjustable by a hinge at a, in order to
bring the prisms nearer each other to suit the eyes of the observer.
   The instrument being held to the eyes, and adjusted to an
object, so that it shall appear single, each eye will see a reflected
image of that projection of the object which would be seen by
the same eye without the pseudoscope.          This is exactly the con
trary of what occurs when the eyes regard the reflected image
of an object in a looking-glass; the left eye then sees the re
flected image of the right-hand projection, and the right eye the
reflected image of the left projection, as shown by fig. 6.
   Plane mirrors cannot be substituted for the reflecting prisms,
for this reason; the refraction of the rays of light at the incident
and emergent surfaces of the prisms enables the reflexion of an
object to be seen when the object is even behind the prolonga
tion of the reflecting surface, as shown at fig. 8, and thus the
reflected binocular image may be seen in the same place as the
object itself, whereas the images cannot be made by means of
plane mirrors thus to coincide.
    When the pseudoscope is so adjusted as to see a near object
while the optic axes are parallel, to view a more distant object
with the same adjustment, the axes must converge, and the more
so as the object is more distant;                       all
                                          nearer objects than that seen
when the axes are    parallel,  will appear  double, because the optic
axes can never       simultaneously directed
                             be                    them.        this

when the eyes are parallel,                 all
                                    nearer objects will appear double,
because the    optic  axes can never converge          make their bin   to

                                the attention      required        is              to   be   di

tude of which is the largest, appears farthest from the eyes, and
the nearest end, the retinal magnitude of which is greatest, ap
pears near the eyes, the rule will no longer be perceived to be
rectangular, but trapezoidal.                             If

will appear with the form just described standing vertically.

the wall, and as if an aperture of the proper dimensions had been
made in the wall to allow it to be seen; if the object be illumi

very obtuse angle towards the eyes of the observer; immediately
before them the object is to be placed at such distance that a
reflected image shall appear in each mirror.              The eyes being
placed before and a little above the object, must be caused to
converge to a point between the object and the mirrors; the
right-hand image of the left eye will then unite with the left
hand image of the right eye, and the converse relief will be per
ceived.    The disadvantages of this method are that only parti
cular objects can be examined, and it requires a painful adapta
tion of the eye to distinct vision.
    2ndly. Place between the object and each eye a lens of small
focal distance, and adjust the distances of the object and the
lenses so that distinct inverted images of the object shall be seen
by each eye; on directing the eyes to the place of the object, the
two images will unite, and the converse relief be perceived.
As the rays of light proceeding from the images have a greater
divergence than those which would proceed from the point to
which the optic axes are directed, long-sighted persons will see
the binocular image more distinctly by wearing a pair of short
sighted spectacles.      In this  experiment the field of view is very
small, on account       of the distance at which it is necessary to
place the lenses from the eyes; but        I have been enabled in this
manner to see beautifully the converse relief of a small ivory
bust and of other small objects, which, however, should be             in
verted in order to see them direct.
   3rdly. The inverted      images of the lenses, instead of being
received   immediately by the eyes, as just described, may be
thrown on a plate of ground glass, as in the case of the ordinary
camera-obscura, and may be then caused to unite by the means
employed in any form of the refracting stereoscope.
                                   § 24.
   The cases of the conversion of relief when the object is regarded
with one eye only, some of which were known more than a cen
tury ago, were taken into consideration and endeavoured to be
explained by me in § 11 of the first part of this memoir, and
Sir David Brewster* has published some interesting and in
structive observations on the same subject; I will therefore not
revert to this matter here, but only to say that           I  have myself
never observed the conversion of relief when looking with both
eyes immediately on a solid object, and if it has been observed
by others under such circumstances,           I should be inclined to
attribute the effect to an     inequality   in the impressions on the

524             Mr. T. S.           Davies on Geometry and Geometers.
stitute our first “Elements.”                                In the   more extended               classes of
research, however, this becomes much more embarrassing; and it
is to be regretted that no single work in which the different
classes of geometric research are intelligibly defined, can be
pointed out. With one more source of difficulty this formidable
list will be concluded; though others, and those not of a minor
character, might have been added.
   The great object of the ancient geometers appears to have been
the solution of problems; and hence the investigation of theorems
held no importance in their estimation, further than as they were
subsidiary to the demonstration of the constructions arrived                                             at,
 or    the analyses
      in                          of by
                         which those constructions were obtained.
Instead, therefore,     investigating the properties     figures and                    of
classing them according        any rule (good  to   bad), only those            or
were recorded that became subservient         some step      other       to                    or
                       problem.            strikingly                                                    in in

which form parts      the most beautiful and interesting classes

           of to
period    Apollonius and Archimedes: even the various curves

strike the mind, yet so many of them are subsidiary to the de
monstration of properties which have that undoubted purpose, as
to require little concession on this point. Besides, my remarks
are more immediately made in reference to the propositions of
plane geometry; and I think we may infer that if such classes of
properties had been investigated, the good taste and judgement
of Pappus would have led him to substitute them for the arbelon
at least”.

the celebrated preface to his seventh book, “were written with a view of
facilitating the study of the geometrical analysis.” High as is the authority

LXXIII.        Early Egyptian Chemistry.                 By W. HERAPATH,                  Esq.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
       THILE engaged in unrolling a mummy at the Bristol
\   W    Philosophical Institution lately, I elicited a few chemical
facts which might probably be interesting to some of your
readers.    On three of the bandages were hieroglyphical charac
ters of a dark colour, as well defined as if written with a modern
pen; where the marking fluid had flowed more copiously than
the characters required, the texture of the cloth had become de
composed and small holes had resulted.             I have no doubt that
the bandages were genuine, and had not been disturbed or un
folded: the colour of the marks were so similar to those of the
present “marking-ink,” that I was induced to try if they were
produced by silver. With the blowpipe                     I
                                                    immediately obtained
a button of that     metal;   the fibre of the linen I proved by the
microscope, and by chemical reagents, to be linen; it is therefore
certain that the ancient Egyptians were acquainted with the
means of dissolving silver, and of applying it as a permanent
ink; but what was their solvent 7                   I
                                              know of none that would
 act on the metal and     decompose    flax fibre but nitric acid, which
 we have been told was unknown until discovered by the alche
 mists in the thirteenth century, which was about 2200 years after
 the date of this mummy, according as                         its
                                                       superscription was
 read.  A   very  probable   speculation    might       raised upon this
                                                               be                             to
 account for the solution        the  of
                                       golden    calf               by
                                                           Moses, who had
 all his mundane knowledge from the Egyptian priests.                   has          It
 been supposed that          he
                            was acquainted with and used the sul
 phuret  of potassium for that purpose: how the inference arose
   know   not;   but    the Egyptians obtained nitric acid,           could         it
                     byif
I
 only have been         the means          sulphuric acid, through the

 agency   of which, and          by
                              the same kind           process, they could
                                                          of
 have separated hydrochloric acid from common salt:                  there    it    is
 fore more   probable  that the   priests   had  taught   Moses the use                       of
 the mixed nitric and hydrochloric acids with which              could dis    he
 solve the statue, rather than       sulphuret, which we have
                                           a                            evi              no

 stained   by the embalming materials,          found

 colouring matter     ofthe flax; they therefore did not,             judge   if    we
 from this specimen, practise bleaching. There were                some        in             of
 the bandages near the selvage some twenty             thirty blue threads;

º    current is changed. As it cannot be shown that the thermal effect
     of this agency is infinitely small, compared with that of the electric
     current, unless y be so large that the term By”, expressing the
    thermal effect of another irreversible agency, cannot be neglected,
    the conditions required for the application of Carnot and Clausius's
    principle, according to the demonstrations of it which have been
    already given, are not completely fulfilled : the author therefore con
    siders that at present this part of the theory requires experimental
    verification.
        1. A first application of the theory is to the case of antimony and
    bismuth ; and it is shown that the fact discovered by Seebeck             ac                                                    is,

were true, the electromotive force of the same pair of metals would
be the same, for the same difference of temperatures, whatever be
the absolute temperatures.        Whether the values of p. previously
found were correct or   not, it would follow, from the preceding expres
sion for  q, that the electromotive force of a thermo-electric pair is
subject to the same law of variation, with the temperatures of the
two junctions, whatever be the metals of which it is composed. This
result being at variance with known facts, the hypothesis on which
it is founded must be false; and the author arrives at the remark
able conclusion, that an electric current produces different thermal
effects, according as it passes from hot to cold, or from cold to hot, in
the same metal.

this platinum wire must, at ordinary temperatures, be between iron
and copper. He found that the platinum wire retained the same
properties after having been heated to redness in a spirit-lamp and
cooled again; but with temperatures above some limit itself con
siderably below that of boiling water, he found that the iron and pla
tinum constituted a more powerful thermo-electric element than the
iron and copper; and he verified that for such temperatures, in the
platinum and copper element the current was from the platinum to the
copper through the hot junction, and therefore that the copper now
lay between the iron and the platinum of the series, or in the position
in which other observers have generally found copper to lie with
reference to platinum.        A second somewhat thinner platinum wire

       sun's rays, and wholly overrules the first condition.
          In terrestrial luminous hot bodies does so to an extent sufficient
                                                                      it
        to give very marked indications.      But this (as the author showed,

536                                         Royal Institution.
in the experiments referred to) applies to that portion only of the
compound rays, which is also transmissible through glass; the
non-transmissible portion is subject wholly to the former condition,
as are all the rays from non-luminous sources (as was shown by Leslie
and others).
   Hence the distinction of at least two species of heating rays
emanating at the same time from the same luminous source.
   From the neglect of this distinction much confusion has been kept
up; and statements involving such confusion have been repeated
from one elementary treatise to another.
   Again, notwithstanding that the experiments of Leslie and others
on the absorption of heat from non-luminous sources, as well as those
of Professor Bache on the radiation from surfaces, demonstrate that
the effect has no relation whatever to colour, yet the contrary asser
tion has been often persisted in.
   Again, “dark heat” is often spoken of without recollecting that
rays of the very sanie quality and properties exist in the compound
radiation from luminous sources.
   The conclusions drawn from later experiments (performed with
all   the advantagesderived from the beautiful invention of the thermo
electric instrument of Nobili), in many instances, are still vague,
from want of attention to the distinction of different species of heat
emanating at the same time from the same source.
   Melloni, in a most extensive and valuable series of experiments,
taking as the sources of heat successively flame, incandescent metal,
boiling mercury, and boiling water, and applying in each instance a
long series of substances as screens, estimated the proportion of rays
out of 100 stopped, which was very different for each screen and
each source: evincing wide differences in “diathermaneity,” while
rock-salt alone was almost totally “diathermanous” to rays from                                  all
sources alike.
   But we must still ask, what species       rays were those respectively
                                                             of

   Nor     the ambiguity removed, though the difference
          is                                                      source           of            is

which some species of rays are entirely stopped, others entirely trans
mitted; and the great differences in “diathermaneity” for heat from
different sources, which Melloni has also established, are nothing else
than absorption of Peculi AR rays by each medium, not more anoma
lous than the corresponding absorptions of luminous rays by different
transparent media so little as yet reduced to law.
    While rock-salt is analogous to colourless media for light, alum on
the other hand is totally impermeable by heat from dark sources, and
partially so by rays from the lamp ; that                              is,

    By other sets      experiments Melloni showed that rays from the
                           in of
lamp transmitted       different proportions                          by by

    Among the most recent researches on the subject are those of
Mr. Knoblauch (of which      a translation is given in Taylor's Foreign
Scientific Memoirs, Part xviii. and xix.), and they are not to be sur
passed for extent and accuracy of detail.
    One series is devoted to the examination of the alleged differences
in radiation of heat proportioned to the temperature of the source.
This, as before observed, is an untenable hypothesis, but Mr. Knob
lauch distinctly refutes it by a series of experiments on alcohol flame,
red-hot metal, hydrogen flame, and an Argand lamp, whose tempera
tures are in the order of enumeration beginning with the highest;
but the power of their heat to penetrate screens is found to follow
exactly the reverse order. And even with lower stages of heat, the
effects bear no proportion to the temperatures as such.       Hence the
 effect is evidently not due to a mere extrication of the heat of tem
perature, but is of a peculiar kind. In a word, agreeably to the pre
ceding remarks, the different species of rays, more or less compounded
together in the several cases, exhibit their diversities of character in
developing heat by their absorption. One very peculiar result             that                        is,
platinum,      at stage intermediate between red and white heat, trans
                      a
mits through              all
                       the screens employed rather less heat than when
at   a red heat. That                is,
                              these intermediate rays are        such wave           by               a
length    as     to       be

while    atthe same time possibly less         the former may of    emitted.                    be
    In another section Mr. Knoblauch adverts to the effects of surfaces
    on
     the absorption       rays, and particularly remarks (p. 205), “The
                                of

a  statement which does not very intelligibly express any conclusion
of   the author's.      Mr. Knoblauch however supports            by elaborate
                                                                                        an it

     It must not however be omitted to notice, however briefly, another
 recent set of researches of high interest, those of M. Silberman; in
 which (among others) the very remarkable fact is established, that
 on transmitting a narrow ray of heat from a heated wire, through
 rock-crystal, there is a singular difference according as the ray passes
parallel or perpendicular to the axis of the crystal : the effect being
 indicated by having the further side of the crystal coated with a fine
 composition of wax, the portion of which in the direction of the ray
 is melted in a circular form in the first instance and in an elliptical
 in the second.
     The general fact of the heterogeneity of heating rays, especially
 from luminous sources, is fully recognised by Melloni as in some
 sense the conclusion from              his experiments. all
     The  hypothesis   that this   heterogeneity      consists simplyin differences
of   wave-length would seem             probable one; though
                                                         a                  still possi            it   is

          Professor Forbes      suggests,     that some other element may also
 enter into the conditions.

 have therefore thought that         it was important to submit these phae
  nomena to new experiments.
     We will confine ourselves here to reproducing some of the facts
  mentioned in the memoir which we have the honour to present to
  the Academy.
     1. After going over all the experiments made on ozone, mention
 ing in particular the important researches of Schönbein, Marignac
 and De la Rive, we have examined, first the oxidizing properties of the
 oxygen procured by the decomposition of water by the galvanic pile;
 the result of these researches is that the pile cannot be employed to
 determine the nature of ozone, because the active principle is found
 only in very small proportion in the oxygen of the pile. We have
 therefore been obliged to study successively all the methods which
 can be employed to electrify oxygen.
     2. The arc which is formed upon the interruption of the voltaic
 circuit does not appear to modify the oxygen in the same manner as
 the ordinary spark, because the elevation of temperature which
 accompanies it probably destroys that which the electricity might
 produce; but according to our observations, this arc may determine
 the combination of gases amongst themselves, acting thus as spongy
 platinum and as electricity; under                                      its

the following experiments were directed to rendering a given volume
of oxygen entirely absorbable whilst cold by mercury, silver, or iodide
of potassium.
    6. When pure and dry oxygen is enclosed in a series of glass tubes
and subjected to the action of electric sparks, if after a time we break
one of the extremities of these tubes to ascertain the volume of gas
which has become immediately absorbable by alkaline iodide, we
shall find that during several hours the modification increases in
proportion to the time of electrization, and that afterwards it appears
to diminish, probably because the spark destroys that which at first
it produces.
    7. The difficulties presented in the preceding experiment induced
us to study the deportment of electrified oxygen with certain absorb
ing bodies capable of immediately seizing the modified oxygen and of
withdrawing this gas from the decomposing action of the excess of
electricity; we therefore passed a series of electric sparks into small
eudiometric tubes full of moist oxygen, and placed over either mer
cury or a solution of iodide of potassium, or containing in their                               in
terior a moistened leaf of silver; we then saw the oxygen become

brilliant, became paler and paler, and presently almost invisible. At
this moment,      onbreaking the tubes under water, we saw this liquid
rush into their interior and fill them entirely, thus showing that                              a
vacuum had been produced, and consequently that the oxygen had
become completely absorbable without heat, by the silver and iodide

            ON      THE ALLOTROPY                   OF      SELENIUM.                    B.Y.   M. HITTORF.
     It  is well known that selenium is softened by heat, becomes semi
 fluid at 212°, and melts at a few degrees higher. In cooling, it be
 comes viscous, thickens more and more, like wax, and then solidifies
 into a reddish mass, with a shining surface and a conchoidal and
 vitreous fracture.         Berzelius had already observed, that when the
 cooling takes place very slowly, the selenium acquires a reddish
 colour, a rough surface, and a dull granular fracture, but that it loses
 this appearance when it is melted again and cooled rapidly.
     The author, having attentively studied these phaenomena, has
 found that they are due to the existence of an allotropic modifica
 tion of selenium analogous to that presented by sulphur, and evi
 denced by the fact that the crystallized selenium melts without any
 previous softening, but at a temperature of 422°6 F.
     When the substance is melted and the temperature raised, for
 instance to 428°, and left to cool with a thermometer immersed in
 it,  the temperature           seen is    descend gradually without the ther

 attained the temperature                the medium. At the same time the
 selenium passes through                       a all viscosity until
