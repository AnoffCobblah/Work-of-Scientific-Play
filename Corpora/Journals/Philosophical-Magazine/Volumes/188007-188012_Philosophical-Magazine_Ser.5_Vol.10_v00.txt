I.    On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Pro
     positions and Reasonings.   By J. WENN, M.A., Fellow and
     Lecturer in Moral Science, Caius College, Cambridge".
     CHEMES of       diagrammatic representation have been so
       familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last
century or so, that many readers, even of those who have
made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be
acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices.
Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called “Eule
rian circles,” has met with any general acceptance. A variety
of others indeed have been proposed by ingenious and cele
brated logicians, several of which would claim notice in a his
torical treatment of the subject; but they mostly do not seem
to me to differ in any essential respect from that of Euler.
They rest upon the same leading principle, and are subject                                     all
alike   tothe same restrictions and defects.
   Euler's plan was first proposed         himf             by
                                                    his ‘Letters            in                 to
a  German Princess,’       the part treating
                                   in             logical principles    of
and rules. What we here represent                                is,
                                                course, the extent     of
or  scope     ofeach term       the proposition.
                                            of      We draw two
circles, and make them include          exclude        or
                                                      intersect one            or
another, according                                                      by
                               to as
                         the classes denoted     the terms happen
to stand     in
             relation   one another      this respect. Thus “All

this immensely simplifies the problem. We can think of each
pair of circles without troubling ourselves about the other
pair; we have nothing resembling implicit equations.              But
suppose that, on the other hand, we had a statement of the
relation of X to         Y
                     and Z combined with others giving that of
Y    to Z and  W,  and,  say, X to W, we should hardly know
 where to begin. Each statement being interlinked with the
 others, no one of them could be disentangled and represented
 separately.   No doubt when the problem had been solved some
 how, and a full determination secured of the mutual relations
 of the various classes, we could then set about undertaking to

 working by help of the diagrams and employing them to aid
 our conceptions in the actual task of solution. The simple
 fact is that on this scheme, as already remarked, we have
 no means of exhibiting imperfect knowledge. What is exhi
 bited is the final outcome of the relation, the actual exclusion
 or inclusion of the classes; and consequently we cannot repre
 sent our partial knowledge or the steps by which we attain to
                                                                         i
 complete information.      This defect comes out even in such a
 simple case as the ordinary disjunctive proposition “Every X
 is either Y or Z.” Such a statement gives us no information
 as to the mutual relations of       to Z; and therefore, since we
                                                   Y
 have no means of    marking   by  aid of our circles any thing but
 the actual relations of these    classes, we should have to draw
  out a complete scheme of                        all
                                     the possibilities.   This would
  demand,       begin with, five different figures displaying the

    A number of deductions will occur to the logical reader
which it may be left to him to work out. Some of them may
be just indicated. For instance, any two compartments be
tween which we can communicate by crossing only one line,
can differ by the affirmation and denial of one term only,
er. gr.    XYZW       and XYZW. Accordingly, when two such
are compounded, or, as we may say, “added ” together, they
                           .
may be simplified by the omission of such term ; for the two
together make                               XY
                                   W. Any compartments between

which we can      only    communicate        crossing two boundaries,
er. gr.     XYZW       and XYZW, must differ              two respects;                in
it  would need four such         compartments        admit      simplifi        to               of
cation, the simplification then resulting              the opportunity          in
of   dropping the reference            two  terms;   ea. gr. XYZW,

XYZW, XYZW,                  XYZW, taken together lead simply
to      W.    Many    similar suggestions will present themselves.

10         Mr. Wenn on the Diagrammatic and Mechanical
to interpret any of the premises which we propose to take
account of.
    Another way of approaching the same question is by in
quiring whether the various subdivisions in our diagram are
to be considered as representing classes, or merely compart
ments into which classes may or may not have to be put.
The latter view must be accepted as being the only one with
which we can conveniently work. We may doubtless regard
them as representing classes; but if we do so, we must keep
in mind the proviso “if there be such a class of things in ex
istence.” And when this condition is insisted on, we appear
to express our meaning best by saying that what our diagram
matic subdivisions (or, for that matter, the corresponding
literal symbols) stand for are compartments which may or
may not happen to be occupied.
    One main reason for insisting upon this point is to be found
in the impossibility of ascertaining, until we have fully ana
lyzed our premises, whether or not any particular combina
tion is possible.    In the simple propositions of the common
logic this difficulty hardly occurs; so that when we say “All
X is Y,” we take it for granted, or are apt to do so, that there
must be both X's and Y's to be found. But if this proposi
tion, or, still more, a complicated one of the same type, oc
curred as one of a group of premises, matters would be very
different. We should then find that to maintain the existence
of   allthe subjects and predicates, instead       merely denying                   of
the existence         of
                    the various combinations   destroyed     them,                                by
would    sadly  hamper          our  interpretation
                                           us       in   groups                           of           of

it out. For instance, the proposition “All X is         is inter                    Y”
preted to mean that there is no such class of things in exist
ence as “X that is not-Y” or XY. All, then, that we have to
do is to scratch out that subdivision in the two-circle figure,

of the four kinds of X which may have to be taken into con
sideration, one only, viz. the XYZ, or the          that is Y but   “X
is not Z,” is left surviving.  Similarly with the possibilities of
Y  and Z: the relative number of these, as compared with the
actualities permitted by the data, are detected at a glance.
   As a more suitable example consider the following—
                 All X
                     is either                Y

to one another as regards  their inclusion and exclusion. The
problem is essentially of the same kind as the syllogistic one;
but we certainly could not draw the figures in the same off
hand way we did there.     Since there are four terms, we sketch
the  appropriate 4-ellipse figure, and then proceed to analyze
the  premises  in order to see what classes are destroyed by
them. The reader will readily see that the first premise anni
hilates all      “XY
                  which is not Z,” or XYZ ; the second de
stroys “XYZ which is not W,” or XYZW ; and the third
“WX which is YZ,” or WXYZ. Shade out these three
classes, and we see the resultant figure at once, viz.

dark. When C E is perpendicular to
CB the right-hand       is partially illuminated (as CA has a compo
nent   along  CE),   while the left-hand is dark. Halfway between
these   positions,  when CE is perpendicular to CD, both sides
appear equally illuminated.          The analyzer being turned round
till this              of illumination is obtained, its position is
noted on the attached circle. When an active substance is
now inserted in the path of the rays, the planes CA, C B are
both rotated through the same angle, and the analyzer has to
be rotated through this angle to give the equal illumination
once more.        The circle again being read, the difference of
readings gives the rotation due to the interposed substance.
    In Jellett's saccharimeter the inclination of the planes of
polarization of the two halves of the field is obtained by inter
posing a prism of Iceland spar. This is formed by cutting a
rhomb nearly parallel to                   its
                                      optic axis, reversing one         the                      of
pieces, and then cementing the two together again with the
plane       separation bisecting the pencil

     II.    Determination of the average light of the lamp in all azi
muths.-It        was noticed at once that there was a vast difference
between the amount of light given out by the lamp in a direc
tion transverse to the plane of the loop and in the direction
of that plane, the former quantity being about three times as
great as the latter; and         it would of course be possible,
on certain assumptions, to estimate what should be the average,
it was also perceived that a direct determination by experiment
would be far more reliable and important than any amount of
theoretical discussion.
   The lamp was therefore mounted on a divided circle with
the axis of the lamp passing through        centre.           its

     III. Determination of current-strength in circuit correspond
ing to various intensities of luminous power in lamp and of
deflections of galvanometer.—For        these determinations the
apparatus was arranged as follows:—The battery-current was
passed through one coil of a Gaugain galvanometer, then
through a copper voltameter, and then through the lamp placed
in the photometer, thence returning to battery.
   The amount of copper deposited in a known time gave of
course the current-strength, in view of the fact that a current
of one weber deposits 326 milligramme of copper in a second.
   Thus, in the first experiment, 1062.4 milligrammes were
deposited in an hour, or in 3600 seconds; therefore

   From the current in webers and the corresponding resistance
in ohms, where these had been determined as above, it was of
course easy to deduce the exact amount of energy transformed
into light and heat, and to compare the same with the actual
candle-power afforded by the lamp at the same time.*.

   As regards the economic relations of this subject, it will be
intereresting to notice that, an average light of 14 candles
 being, obtained at the expense of 0.116 of a horse-power in
 electric current, each horse-power of electric energy would
 furnish 120 candle-power in these lamps.                        To obtain this
 horse-power of electric energy, however, considerably more

mechanical energy must be applied to the driving-pulley of
the electric generator.                     If
                            the loss so encountered was 40 per
cent., as appears to be the case with some of the best machines
which have been measured accurately, this would reduce the
light developed to 72 candle-power for each horse-power of
mechanical energy applied to the driving-pulley of the electric
generator.
   When we remember that with the arc-light there has been
obtained from 1200 to 1800 candle-power per horse-power of
mechanical energy applied to the generator, it is evident that
Mr. Edison's lamp as now made does not escape the enormous
loss which has heretofore been encountered by          forms                         all             of

out fracture was observed only with a particular kind of
 German glass.

   The changes of volume observed with many kinds of mica,

water for a long time, were comparable with those observed
with glass; but with fresh caoutchouc the change is about

with Thuringian glass. There remains, as with the changes
of volume of the thermometer condenser, a residual displace
ment in the same direction as the original displacement, which
gradually disappears.
   21.  With  the same glass-thread electrometer, the displace
ment is proportional to the square of the difference of electric
potential of the two coatings.
   22. The residual displacement increases with the difference
of electric potential and with the conductivity of glass; it
seems therefore to depend, like the residual expansion of the
                                        i.
the thermometer condenser, on the polarization of the glass.
   23.  By means of a suitable key         coatings of the thermo
meter condenser could be      put  into  communication,   first with
the poles of a bichromate battery of 44 cells, and then with a
sensitive mirror-galvanometer.        The deflection of the galva
nometer was then    proportional    to the electric capacity of the
thermometer     condenser.     When the temperature rises, the
change of volume corresponding to a given difference of poten
tial is proportional to the increase of electric capacity for the
same thermometer condenser.
   24. Similarly, the deflections of a glass-thread electrometer,
made of the same kind of glass as a thermometer condenser,
increase in the same proportion as the electric capacity of the
condenser.    A temperature-increase of 1° C. corresponds to
an increase of deflection or of capacity of about 0.003 of the
original value for flint-glass and about 0.012 for Thuringian
glass.
   25. The greater the difference of electric potential and the
higher the temperature of the glass, the more quickly do the
deflections of a glass-thread electrometer take place.         Flint
glass acts more slowly than Thuringian glass.
           Changes   of Elasticity caused by Electricity.
   26. The elasticity of flint-glass, Thuringian glass, and caout
chouc is diminished by electricity; but that of mica and gutta
percha is increased.
   27. A magnetic bar was hung at the lower end of a hollow
glass thread silvered inside and outside, so that the magnetic
axis was nearly at right angles to the magnetic meridian. The
moment of the magnetic force was then equal and opposite to
the moment of torsion of the glass thread corresponding to the
angle q through which it had been twisted.
   A vertical mirror was attached to the magnetic bar, whose
position was observed with a telescope and scale. When the
coatings of the glass thread are connected with the coatings
of a charged Leyden jar, the angle of torsion p becomes
greater by the amount Ab, while the magnetic moment re

mains almost unaltered. The increase of the angle 4                              corre
sponds, therefore, to the decrease of the force of torsion                        of the
suspension-thread; and A<U+017F>h is the measure of the change of
elasticity of the thread.
   Upon discharge, the magnet and thread resume their ori
ginal position.
   The decrease in the force of torsion is nearly proportional
to the square of the difference in electric potential of the two
coatings, and is greater the less the thickness of the walls of
the glass thread.

 volume takes place instead of an increase.

in the fluid between the platinum electrodes, and the volta

  It is remarkable   that the order of the substances examined,
whether they be arranged according to thermic expansion or
electric expansion, has no relation to the order of their con
ductivities for electricity.
   34. Changes of temperature of a few hundredths of a
degree suffice to bring about the change of volume produced
by electricity in the first group of substances, that to which
water belongs.
   The length of time that the expansion lasts in the case
of insulating fluids is opposed to the hypothesis of an                                 in
direct expansion, resulting from heat produced by feeble
currents of electricity between the electrodes—as is also the
small increase of the expansion when the conducting-power
of water is increased by the addition of hydrochloric acid, and
also the decrease in volume in the case of the fatty oils, which
also expand upon increase of temperature from 0°C.

        To   the Editors        of   the   Philosophical Magazine and Journal,
     GENTLEMEN,
You;        correspondent
       who recently
                                                  is,
                             we presume, the Major Herschel
                         “Nature’ commenced his review on
                                        in
 Colonel Clarke's “Geodesy” thus:—“It     well that there are                   is
 men brave enough with the pen                                   as   there are others brave with

  44         Messrs. Ayrton and Perry on the Determination
   the surgeon's knife, or the soldier's bayonet.” This is true,
  provided the knife and the bayonet are handled with skill and
  for the benefit of mankind. But does not Major Herschel's
  review, like his present criticism of our paper, instinctively
  suggest rather the hewing of the professional fighting man
  than the courage of the skilful surgeon.
     I. To his first objection, that our doctrine regarding labora
  tory teaching is “as erroneous as the design is laudable,” we
  would reply that as our paper was read at the Physical Society,
  of which many of the Members are teachers of physics, and
  anxious, like ourselves, to ascertain the best mode of carrying
  on experimental work in a physical laboratory containing
  many young students, we considered it not inopportune to
  mention that some years' practice in laboratory teaching had
  led us to strongly advocate the plan of students assisting in
  original investigations, and to deprecate their merely repeat
  ing well-known lecture-experiments, very commonly the whole
~laboratory work a student is set to do.           Our concluding
  remarks were not, as Major Herschel seems to think, directed
  against practice in the use either of Kater's reversible pendu
  lum, or, in fact, of any other standard measuring-instrument.
     II. Your correspondent charges us with “neglect of the
 Toommonest and most essential principles of exact experimen
  tation.” Now, as the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine”
  have allowed this grave charge, one of the gravest that could
  be brought against scientific men, to be made in the pages of
  their Journal, it demands careful consideration. To prove his
  accusation and to show that he is “not making a random
  charge,” Major Herschel quotes a paragraph from our paper
  in which we explain that the well-known “corrections for                   in
  finitely small arcs and for the air-friction” are negligible in
  the case of our long pendulum, “on account of the very small
  angle through which the pendulum, usually swung, and that
  the decrement of the amplitude of the vibrations was imper
  ceptible even after many swings,” and in which we further
  mention that, fearing the possibility of an “error arising from
  its flexibility and slight elasticity which would not affect                a
  rigid compound pendulum,”                     we
                                       endeavoured     calculate the
                                                              to
  magnitude       ofthe special possible errors for      long wirea
  pendulum. This Major Herschel frankly states perhaps                        he
          regret much the appearance       Mr. Herschel's letter, not

mathematical investigation of the influence of the “kick” we
referred to on the time of vibration of a long wire pendulum.
   First, for Arc.—We said that the result of this correction
was unimportant, and we did so for this reason.     The length
of the pendulum    was 939-09   centims.; the amplitude  or the
length of a complete swing backwards and forwards varied on
different days from 50 to 20 centims., but was always less than
30 centims. for the observations given in our paper; so that we
have to consider an elongation of 74 centims, on each side of
the vertical line. The correcting factor to reduce to infinitely
small arcs           is,

mention that we screwed the rigid brass plate on which the
steel knife-edge rested firmly to a principal beam of the roof

unexceptionally great rigidity on account of earthquakes, so
common in Japan.
  WI. Major     #dd ends his letter by saying that “the force

the above formula than from the experiments recorded in the

that is no reason why our experiments should not have been
            since it is always important that results obtained
  y one method should be confirmed by those obtained by
another. But he further says, the paper contains no means
of checking the result experimentally obtained. To remove

    Might we again draw attention to an important point ad:
vocated     in our paper, but which runs the risk of being missed
altogether in this discussion.        It was our simple proposal of
an    easy  way    of  measuring   the relative value of g over the
earth. Let rigid pendulums be sold, each accompanied by a
table giving the number of swings per hour at many different
temperatures in London.           An observer in Siberia, say, finds
the number of         swings  per hour at an observed temperature,
and from his table at once sees the value of g for the pla
 relatively to that of London.
     In conclusion might we venture to suggest that, whatever
 may be Major Herschel’s opinion of our ability as experi
 menters, whatever may be the estimate he forms of the value
 of our results, the style and tone of his letter is hardly what is
 usually employed by scientific men when discussing an inves
 tigation patiently made and faithfully recorded.

             first observation of an    anomaly in the dispersion of
 THElight         was, as is well known,     made by Le Roux upon
 iodine    vapour.     The  vapour  of iodine, which chiefly transmits
 only the extreme blue and red rays, shows a stronger refrac
 tion for the red than for the blue rays.         As then anomalous
 dispersion was discovered in fuchsine by Christiansen, and I

sion-power of the sodium-flame with increased density of the
vapour. While a flame coloured by a sodium-salt, inserted
as absorbing medium in the path of the rays, gives two sharp
dark lines of absorption in the yellow of the spectrum, when
the density of the vapour becomes greater these absorption
lines blend into a single broad band with fainter margins.
Now with these bands the dispersion-anomaly appears distinctly
visible, while with the narrow absorption-lines, though at any
rate present, it is not recognizable, since here it is limited to
an extremely small compass in close proximity to the two sides
of each absorption-line.
     Ifwe could form a real prism of incandescent sodium
vapour, we should probably be able to observe indications of
 anomalous dispersion in the narrow absorption-lines, even with
 less density of the vapour.        My endeavours, however, to con
 vert the conical flame into a prismatic one by applying plates
of glass or mica to                its
                               sides, led        result. Justto   nolittle   .           as

* This mode of representation of a function is Fourier's formula.
      The values of the unknowns thus found are sextuple inte
  grals, an exact solution of the problem, but which give no idea
  of the general form of the motion. It is only after laborious
  transformations, supposing the initial disturbance included
  within a limited space, that we arrive at interpreting them so
  as to make evident the limited wave-form.
      Beside this complication,\Fourier's formula has another in

  convenience: the integration with respect to some of the vari-T

of thick copper wire or plates. The calibration now takes
place in the following manner:—
   The contact N of the “bridge-wire” MN, passing through
a sensitive mirror-galvanoscope, is put successively into #.
cups 1 and 2, and the corresponding positions M, and M2,
upon the wire A MB, of the contact are determined.

    and     are now exchanged, so that    comes into the place             I
of      the contact N is put successively into the cups 2 and
3; and again the corresponding positions M', Ms of the con
tact M are determined.  We now move Ifurther on, by making
it and III change places, put the contact N successively into
3 and 4, and determine the positions M's and M.
   We proceed in this way until has arrived at the place of   I
the last resistance W.
   We thus obtain, upon the bridge, the lengths Mi M, M', Ms,
M’s M1, &c., which are each proportional to the same resistance.

calibration and the well-known method of thermometer-cali

64                    Geological  Society:-On a
tion (from want of time) to the northern part of the forest than to
the rest.   This district has during the last two years engaged their
special attention. They had provisionally retained the name quart
zite for the rocks exposed about Blackbrook &c., probably the lowest
visible on the forest.    This name proves to be inappropriate; and
they propose to call the group, which contains much fine detrital
volcanic material, the Blackbrook Series. They have also reason to
believe that the anticlinal fault is less than was supposed, and that
we have here a fairly unbroken base for the forest-rock already
described.    In this case there ought to be representatives of the
great agglomeratic masses on the western side of the anticlinal
(High Towers &c.).       The authors believe that they have found
these, though as much finer and more waterworn detritus, in the
greenish grits above Longcliff and Buckhill.         The authors also
believe that they have succeeded in tracing a coarse agglomerate
with slate fragments round about three fourths of the circumference
of the forest.     Further notes upon the district of Bardon Hill,
Peldar Tor, and Sharpley are given; and the origin of the remark
able rock of the last, so like some of the Ardennes porphyroids, is
discussed; the authors believe it to be a volcanic tuff, altered by the
passage of water or of acid gases.      Descriptions of the microscopic
structure of some of the rock fragments included in the coarse
agglomerate and of some of the slates are given.        Also a notice of
two small outbursts of igneous rock, of the northern syenite type,
previously unnoticed are mentioned.
   2.  “On the Geological Age of Central and West Cornwall.”         By
J. H. Collins, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author divided the stratified rocks of this district into four
groups, as follows:—
   1. The Fowey Beds, mostly soft shales or fissile sandstones, with
some beds of roofing slate; no limestones or conglomerates.       These
beds cover an area of not less than eighty square miles, and contain
numerous fragmentary fish-remains and other fossils, many as yet
undetermined, the whole, however, indicating that the beds are
either Lower Devonian or Upper Silurian.         The strike of the beds
is N.W. to S.E.; and they are estimated to be not less than 10,000
feet thick.
   2. The Ladock Beds, consisting of slaty beds, sandy shales, sand
stones, and conglomerates; no limestones and no fossils.           They
cover an area of more than 100    square  miles to the west and south
of St. Austell, strike from east to west, and overlie Lower Silurian
rocks unconformably. They are estimated at from 1000 to 2000
feet thickness.
   3. The Lower Silurians consist largely of slates and shales, with
some very thick conglomerates (one being at least 2000 feet thick),
some quartzites, and a few thin beds of black limestone.            The
quartzites and limestones have yielded fossils (chiefly Orthidae)
which are pronounced to be of Bala or Caradoc age by Davidson
and others.     The total thickness of these beds is estimated at

                Second Precambrian Group in the Malvern                          Hills.    65
      23,000 feet; and the fossils are found in the upper beds only.
      Instead of occupying only about 12 square miles, as shown on the
      Survey Maps, they extend over nearly 200 square miles, and reach
      southward beyond the Helford River, and westward to Marazion.
      The strike of these rocks is from north-east to south-west.
         4. The Ponsanooth Beds occur beneath the Lower Silurians, and
      unconformable with them (strike north-west to south-east); they
      are often crystalline, and are estimated at 10,000 feet thickness.
         Each of these formations has its own set of intrusive rocks; each
      has been contorted and in part denuded away before the deposition
                                                                 -
      of its successor.
         The various granitic bosses have been pushed through this already
      complex mass of stratified rocks without materially altering their
      strike, which does not in general coincide with the line of junction.
         The chemical effects of the igneous intrusions are generally con
      siderable, and somewhat proportioned to their relative bulk.
         3. “On a Second Precambrian Group in the Malvern Hills.” By
      C. Callaway, Esq., D.Sc., F.G.S.
         These rocks occupy an area of about half a square mile on the
      east of the Herefordshire Beacon; they are compact, flinty “ horn
      stones,” very like some of the rocks at Lilleshall, in Shropshire,
      which belong to the newer Precambrian group of the Wrekin. The
      strike is not distinct, but probably is quite discordant from that of
      the subjacent gneissic rocks.     As in Shropshire, so here Hollybush
      sandstone and Dictyonema-shales       occur on the flank of the Precam
      brian mass, and each seems to have formed an island in the Lower
      Silurian seas, which, during the formation of the May-Hill group,
      was depressed.      In fact, in both regions the chief movements of
      upheaval, subsidence, and dislocation appear to have been contem
      poraneous.    Thus they are very probably of the same age; and this
      probably is that of the Pebidians of St. David's, to some of which
...   they have, lithologically,    very close resemblance.

of the  Post-Tertiary deposits in Europe,  Asia, and North America,
to show their various  heights, and  especially of the raised beach on
Moel Tryfaen in Caernarvonshire, which was from 1170 to 1350
feet high.   Some of the shells in that deposit were boreal and did
not now live in the adjacent sea.        The author stated that no
shells of a peculiarly northern character had been noticed in the
west or south of England.        He then questioned the permanence
 and even the antiquity of the present oceanic basins, from a con
sideration not only of the fauna which now inhabits the greatest
depths, but also of the extent of oscillation which had prevailed
everywhere since the Tertiary period. A complete list of the Moel
Tryfaen fossils was given, to the number of 60, besides 3 distinct
varieties, of which number 11 were arctic or northern, and the
rest lived in Caernarvon Bay.       All of these fossils were more or
less fragmentary.

   3.  “On the Pre-Cambrian       Rocks of the North-western and
Central Highlands     of Scotland"     By Henry Hicks, Esq., M.D.,
F.G.S.
   The author, after examination, considers the rocks of the fol
lowing districts to be wholly or in part Pre-Cambrian:-
   (1) Glen Finnan, Loch Shiel to Caledonian Canal.—In the former
district the rocks are gneiss, often massive.     In Glen Firmilee is a
series which the author regards as newer and Pebidian.         At Faro
fern are quartz rocks which the author identifies with those beneath
the limestone in Glen Laggan, near Loch Maree, and probably of          .
Silurian age. At Bannavie is a granite which the author considers
to be Pre-Cambrian.
   (2) Fort William and Glen Nevis.-In this district chloritic
schists and gneiss occur, which the author regards as Pebidian.
   (3) Ballachulish, Glen Coe, and Black Mount.—Chloritic schists
and quartzites occur here, followed near Loch Leven unconformably
by Silurian rocks.      On the east of the Ardsheal peninsula there is
granite which theauthor believes to be Pre-Cambrian. Going eastward
from Ballachulish we have slates, probably of Silurian age. In Glen
coe are granite-banded felsite, gneiss, breccia, resembling as a whole
the rocks of the Welsh Arvonian group. Between the Black Mount
and Loch Sullich are traces of a great Pre-Cambrian axis, bringing
up the gneissic series; this is traceable also towards Glen Spean
and Loch Laggan to the N.E.
   (4) Tyndrum to Callander.—South and east of the former are
gneisses and silvery mica-schists.     Crystalline limestones and ser
pentines are associated near Loch Tay, resembling those in the
Pebidian series of North Wales.
   The author states that the Silurian (and Cambrian) rocks flank
the Pre-Cambrian in lines from N.E. to S.W., and overlap Ben Ledi
on the south side. Thus here, as elsewhere, subsequent denudation
has removed enormous masses of the more recent rocks, only here
and there leaving patches of these in folds along depressions in the
old Pre-Cambrian floor.

     NOTE ON THE CONDUCTIVITY         OF TOURMALINE      CRYSTALS.

maline crystals for heat and electricity.                Dr. Lodge had shown
that an explanation of pyroelectricity might be given if such crys
tals possessed a unilateral conductivity for electricity.                    A body is
said to possess unilateral conductivity for any thing if it conducts
better in one direction than in the opposite one—as, for example,
a tube with a series of funnels in it                turned the same way for      all
fluids, and apparently,          the case       Geissler's tubes, for electricity

oxalate but ferrous phosphate. Again, ferrous phosphate exhibits
powerful developing-properties when dissolved               sodic     ammonic         in                 or
tartrate. This reaction, however,             not       itself decisive, inas

silver salt) is wholly without developing-power, an opportunity
offered itself of testing the question.   And it proved that a solu
tion obtained by adding one of disodic phosphate to one of ferrous
sulphate until a permanent precipitate began to form, undoubtedly
possessed developing-powers, though in a less degree.
   The number of ferrous salts capable of developing the latent
image is very considerable. Singular anomalies are often shown:
a given salt prepared in one way may develop, while prepared in
another it may have no such power.      Nor is it possible to form an
opinion beforehand as to whether a given compound of ferrous
oxide will exhibit this power or not: compounds nearly allied do
not exhibit analogies in this respect.   For example, ferrous phos
phate and ferrous metaphosphate are active developers, while fer
rous pyrophosphate has no similar power.
   Among other ferrous salts possessing more or less developing
power may be mentioned ferrous hyposulphite (hydrosulphate),
ammonio-chloride, acetate, antimonio-tartrate, &c.       Ferrous for
miate, which might naturally be expected to be a powerful deve
loper, is almost, though not entirely, destitute of the property.
The most active agents found were ferrous borate, phosphate, sul
phite, and oxalate, respectively dissolved, the phosphate in neutral
ammonium oxalate, the others in neutral potassium oxalate.—Silli

NOTE ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF GUARD-RING ELECTROMETERS.

aluminium disk, for the sake of lightness, surrounded by a guard
ring of brass. It is essential for the accuracy of the calculation
of the absolute values of capacity and quantity made with them
that the electricity should be as uniformly distributed as possible
on the surface of the disk and guard.      It is for the sake of produ
cing a uniform distribution on the disk that the guard is added.
Hence any arrangement which disturbs this uniformity of distri
bution is to be avoided. Now, whether the contact of dissimilar
metals in itself produces an appreciable difference of potential be
tween them, or whether it is the air near different metals that is at
different potentials, there is no doubt that when the plates of an
accumulator are of different metals there is an appreciable accumu
lation of electricity upon them. Consequently in the guard-ring
electrometer the distribution of electricity on the aluminium disk
cannot be the same as on the brass guard connected with             it.   It
might seem      as
                 if the other plate should  be   of the same material;

     XII. On the Resultant of a large Number of Vibrations of the

       arrived at
                 in          an investigation upon this subject, has
                          the conclusion that the resultant of n vibra
     tions of unit amplitude and arbitrary phase approaches the
     definite value Vn when n is very great. It can be shownt,
     however, that this conclusion is inaccurate, and that the result
     ant tends to no definite value, however great the number of
     components may be.                        -
         But there is a modified form of the question, which admits
                                                                           ºjº
     of a definite answer, and was perhaps vaguely before Verdet's
     mind.   If  we inquire what is the average intensity in a great
     number of cases, or, in the language of the theory of
     lities, what is the eagectation of intensity in a single case of
     composition, we shall find that the result is that assigned by
     Werdet, namely n.
         A simple but instructive variation of the problem may be
     obtained by supposing the possible phases limited to two oppo
     site phases, in which case it is convenient to discard the idea
     of phase altogether, and to regard the amplitudes as at ran
      dom positive or negative.      If the signs are the same, the
                                                all
      resultant intensity    n°;
                             is      if,the other hand, there are
                                           on                                           as
      many positive   as negative, the result    zero.  isBut although
      the intensity may range from         0          n*,

   The small dots represent points at which                            Z=–3h. Putting
this value for Z, the equation becomes

 86                   Mr. W. Baily on the Vibrations of a Film
    Hitherto we have dealt only with infinite films; we will
 now consider what forms of vibration can be maintained in
 films of limited size, the waves undergoing reflection from the
 boundaries of the film.
    When the film is an equilateral triangle, suppose a set of
 waves to be started having their fronts L to one of the sides
of the triangle. These waves will be reflected so as to have
their fronts L to another side, and again reflected so as to
have their fronts. L to the remaining side, and by another
reflection they will assume their first direction.     the wave         If
length is such that the time a wave takes to return to the same
position is an integral number of wave-periods, we shall have
the case of three sets of equal waves meeting each other at
angles of 120°.     Fig. 8 shows the form of vibration when the
wave-length is <U+017F>º of the side of the triangle (no allowance
being made for the change of phase at the reflections). The
thin lines show the position of the maximum displacement due
to each wave at one of the instants at which these lines all
pass through certain points, and the numerals 1, 1 show the
 ventral segments which are then at their maximum displace
 ment, the yentral segments 2, 2 and 3, 3 come to their maxi
mum at different times, as already explained.
    Again, suppose two sets of waves to be started in opposite
directions, each set having the front L to a side of the tri
angle, and the phases of both sets being the same along a per
pendicular from an angle on the opposite side; we shall with
a suitable wave-length have six sets of waves meeting each
other in pairs, the directions of the pairs making with one
another angles of 120°, and                all
                                     the phases being the same                            at
º º
certain   points.
   Again, suppose waves          start simultaneously from each
                                      to                                                  of
the sides      the equilateral triangle; the waves will
                 of                                         reflected   be
so    as   produce other three sets
            to                                     of
                                         waves also with their fronts
          to the          having their direction              of
                                                    motion reversed.
   ere we again get the six sets
                                                 6, of
                                        waves above considered, but
in   adifferent position. See fig.                       in
                                           which this form     vibra         of

                                                                                  of at

reflections. The continuous lines show the coincidence            the
maximum displacement                 in
                           one direction due   the waves meet to
ing and the dotted lines show the same coincidence
      ;                                                     the               in
opposite direction.  At the black spots we get the coincidence
of    all
       the maximum displacements        the same direction
                                                         in                        ;      so
that these spots show the ventral segments.   The wave-length
is   equal       to   the distance   between the ventral segments             x   *.
With        the number       of   ventral segments shown       in   the figure the

wave-length equals     of the height of the triangle when no
allowance is made for change of phase at the reflections. The
form of vibration of the film is shown in fig. 4, which has been
already explained.
   We may obtain a similar set of waves in a rhombus having
one of      its
            angles   60°,    we suppose sets
                                  =       if       waves     start           of            to
                 from the four sides, and    each direction from       in
the shorter diagonal.
  If  in  such rhombus set
                        a          waves starts from the longer
                                          a         of

opposite directions start from the longer diagonal, we get the
six sets.
   With right-angled isosceles triangle we may start set

88       Vibrations of a Film in reference to the Phoneidoscope.
or six sets meeting in pairs whose directions do not make equal
angles with one another.
      n the phoneidoscope we have a soap-film thrown into a
state of vibration by a musical note.         The effect is to send the
matter of the film towards the ventral segments, and to make
them the thickest part of the film.         The consequence is that
the colours of thin    plates  are seen less at the ventral segments
than at other    parts of the film; and we can recognize the ven
tral segments in this manner. This effect on the film may be
illustrated by M. Decharmé's experiments on Chladni’s plates",
in which he shows that if a thin layer of water instead of sand
be spread over the plate, the water covers the ventral segments
and the nodes are left bare.
    The two following experiments may, think, be explained             I
by what has been said.
    (1) A square film, H. of an inch in side, was thrown into
vibration by a note having 92 vibrations in a second. The
position of the ventral segments was that shown in figs. 5
and 7.      Hence the vibration of the film was the result of four
sets of waves starting simultaneously from the four sides of
the film ; and the wave-length was approximately of the side;
and the wave-velocity was approximately $ x                 x 92 inches
per second—that              is,

   The experiments of March 18, performed as they were with
a sun approaching the horizon, having been less decisive than
could have been desired, they were repeated on the following
day, but with the disadvantage of a feeble sunlight, with the
result of showing that six times more iodine was set free in
the absence than in the presence of starch. The suspended
precipitate of starch iodide cut off the light, except upon the
superficies of the solution.    Henceforth the employment of
starch was abandoned.
   The next set of trials was instituted in order to observe the
                                      ††,
influence, upon the rate of change, of larger access of oxygen
than that derivable from the air already dissolved, or in con

  And since 100 cubic centims. of water, when saturated with
  air under the ordinary circumstances of temperature and pres
  sure, would hold in solution only about 1 mgrm. of oxygen,
  the maximum amount         of iodine which could     be liberated du
  ring one of these tests, in case no fresh absorption of oxygen
  took place from the upper surface, would be 16 mgrim.             The
  influence of these conditions upon the accuracy of the estima

  to further investigation.

     In the case of nitric acid the reactions become much more
  complicated. For, in the first place, of the three mineral acids,
 nitric is the only one which spontaneously decomposes when
 subjected to              in closed vessels. This is true both of
 the concentrated acids and when diluted with 500 times their
 volume of water. Moreover, in the latter case the presence of
 starch had no influence except in the nitric acid, in which it
 nearly doubled the rate of decomposition.           The same effect of
 starch (whether it is true of     organic  matter in general has not
 been determined) is to be noted in the above table of decom
 positions for March 18, in which it will be seen that in the
 trials where starch was present the amounts of iodine liberated
 by nitric acid were largely in excess of those set free by equi
valent amounts of other acids.         In fine, while nitric acid con
forms to the general law of actinic change, as expressed by the
equation
it is likewise subject to the special decomposition
           4 HNOs (in sunlight) =2 N, O, + 2 H, 0 + O.

       Solutions of Iodides under the Influence of Actinism.                             95
   On comparison of the arithmetical means of the results ob
tained in fifty-four trials during the course of the same day,
the striking fact is brought out that the amounts of iodine
liberated by the two acids in the presence of the same base
stand in a constant ratio to one another. The law of actinic
force herein indicated may provisionally be expressed by the
formula—The chemism of the chlorine radical is to that of the
#SO, radical (measured by the relative amounts of iodine
liberated by each respectively in solutions of the metallic
iodides exposed to the sunlight) as 1:47: 1.       There is no
reason for inferring from the experiments that a similar defi
nite ratio exists between the amounts of iodine liberated from
different soluble iodides in the presence of the same acid.
  Comparison of                 the   Actinic Intensities of the Solar, Electric,
                                     and Magnesium Light.
  In  making this comparison, the amounts of iodine liberated
at the hour of maximum actinic intensity (1–1.30 P.M.) were
taken in the case of the sun. The electric light was that
emanating from a lamp of 7000 candle-power falling upon the
solutions at a distance of six inches; the magnesium light,
that derived from the burning of a single ribbon in the ordi
nary lamp placed at the same distance.     The time of expo
sure to the electric light was 10 minutes, to the magnesium
light 25 minutes, to the sun an hour; in the table        are                      all

circular given vorticity and given impulse.

 resultant of impulse. The modes successively described above
 are successive solutions of the maximum-minimum problem of
  § 4—a determinate problem with the multiple solutions indi
 cated above, but no other solution, when the vorticity is given
 in a single simple ring of the liquid.
    9. The problem of steady motion, for the case of a vortex
 line with infinitely thin core, bears a close analogy to the fol
 lowing purely geometrical problem:—
    Find the curve whose length shall be a minimum with given
 resultant projectional area, and given resultant areal moment
 (§ 27 below). This would be identical with the vortex prob
 lem if the energy of an infinitely thin vortex ring of given
 volume and given cyclic constant were a function simply of
 its apertural circumference. The geometrical problem clearly
 has multiple solutions answering precisely             the solutions                  to                                  of
 the vortex problem.
    10. The very high modes          solution are clearly very nearly
                                                           of
 identical for the two     problems     (infinitely high modes iden
 tical), and are found thus:—
    Take the solution derived          the manner explained above,

   ives a system which is most easily un-         Fig. 5.
            by taking two plane circular
rings of stiff metal linked together.
 First, place them as nearly coincident
as their being linked together permits
 (fig. 5). Then separate them a little,
and incline their planes a little, as shown
in the diagram. Then bend each into
 an unknown shape determined by the strict solution of the
 transcendental problem of analysis to which the hydro-kinetic
 investigation leads for this case.
     13.     back now to the supposition of § 11, and alter it to
this:—
   Let each thread make one turn and a half, or any odd num
ber of half turns, round the toroidal core: thus each thread
will have an end coincident with an end of the other. Let
these coincident ends be united.   Thus there will be but one
endless thread  making an odd number N of turns round the
toroidal core. The cases of N=3 and N=9 are represented
in the annexed diagrams (figs. 8 and 9)".
   Imagine now a three-threaded     toroidal helix, and                       let   N
denote the whole number     turns round the toroidal core; we

demonstrating the stability of the Helmholtz ring in any case.
With given vorticity, imagine the ring to be thicker in one
place than in another. Imagine the given vorticity, instead
of being distributed in a symmetrical circular ring, to be dis
tributed in a ring still with a circular axis, but thinner in one
part than in the rest.         It is clear that, with the same vorticity
and the same impulse, the energy with such a distribution is
greater than when the ring is symmetrical. But now                           the                              let
figure   of  the cross section       the  ring,ofinstead      being   approxi     of
mately circular,          made considerably oval. This will diminish
                            be
the energy with the same vorticity and the same impulse.
Thus from the figure             steadiness we may pass continuously
                                      of
to   others with same vorticity, same impulse, and same energy.
Thus, we see that the figure             steadiness  of        stated above,is,   as                                a

nor    of absolute minimum energy. Hence, from the maximum
minimum problem we cannot derive proof                      stability.       of

     The object, on which the resolving-power of the telescope is
tested is a grating of fine wires, constructed on the plan em
ployed by Fraunhofer for diffraction-gratings.                A stout brass
wire or rod is bent into a        horseshoe,    and                     its

 than we should have any right to expect.
    Besides these slits, four circular apertures were examined.
 Their diameters were measured under a magnifier on a glass
 scale divided to tenths of a millimetre, and were found to be
 ‘172, 315, 48, 63 centimetre respectively. In the case of
 the two smaller holes the illumination given by an ordinary
 soda-flame was hardly sufficient; but with the assistance of a
jet of oxygen the observation could be made.

    That  a circular aperture would be less effective than a slit
 of the same width might have been expected. Even in the
 case of a slit it is advantageous to stop some of the central, in
 order to increase the relative importance of the extreme, rays;
and with a circular aperture the extreme rays are much worse
                           dº
 represented than with a slit. From the above results it appears
 that, to have an equal                           the circular aperture
 must be about a tenth part wider than the slit.
    Merely to show the                     of resolving-power on aper
 ture it is not necessary to use a telescope at all. It is suffi
 cient to look at wire gauze backed by the sky, or by a flame,
 through a piece of blackened cardboard pierced by a needle and
 held close to the eye. By varying the distance the point is
 easily found at which resolution ceases; and the observation is

in fact to allow the use of a wider, and therefore more easily
measurable, aperture.
  An interesting modification of the experiment is obtained
by using lights of various wave-lengths. For this purpose we
may have recourse to coloured glasses; but the best results
would doubtless require the rays of the spectrum.

IN ofOctober 1878 I communicated         a paper to the Academy
               in Paris, which

                of formulae              the polar compression of

corrected for different small disturbing influences; and the
 final value          the polar compression after

XIX.    On a Means to determine the Pressure at the Surface of

    EILHARD WIEDEMANN".
    a former paper I tried to show that we can calculate, at
IN least approximately, the time elapsing between two en
counters of the molecules of a gas by measuring the greatest
difference in the length of path at which interference of two
rays of light coming from the same source of light is possible.
I  may be allowed here to quote a passage out of that paperf:—
    “Two rays of light can only interfere if they emanate from
the same source of light, and if there is no sudden change of
phase in the source of light during the time elapsing between
the two instants at which the first and second ray leave the
source.     That difference in phase at which interference is still
possible is therefore a measure of the time during which no
sudden change in phase has taken place at the source of light.
A luminous body sends out light coming from a great number
of atoms or molecules.        Each molecule will only vibrate regu
larly as long as it does not come within the sphere of action
of another molecule; that                     is,
                                       will only vibrate regularly

which interference is possible.       According to the last-men
            *
tioned  observer,  a difference in path of 50,000,and even 100,000
wave-lengths still produces appreciable interference-bands in
sodium light. The time corresponding to this difference of
phase is          0.5 x 10-1” second.     Calculating approximately
the mean free    path   (as we only  want to compare the orders of
magnitude) for hydrogen at 0° and atmospheric pressure, we
find for the time necessary to traverse this free path 1:14 x 10."
 second.    The two numbers are sufficiently close to justify the
assumption that the sodium atoms may vibrate during 50,000
oscillations without sudden change of phase. We see at the
same time that the disappearance of Newton's bands need not
be due to the widening of the lines producing them.
    As the mean time elapsing between two encounters depends
chiefly on the pressure, and far less on the temperature, we
have a means of determining approximately the pressure of a
gas by an examination of the light which it sends out.

    When moderately large quantities of gas are present, such
as two   or three per cent., the difference in colour of the
light emitted by the two wires becomes so striking as to cause
some difficulty in judging of the exact position of equal
illumination of the screen, a difficulty of course felt more or
less with        all
              photometers when examining lights             different                        of

divided into several separate currents (or “splits,”         they are                            as
called).   These, passing  along  the principal travelling-ways,  are

west      the island. Again,
         of                         the mainland, blocks
                                                     on          the coarse

rocks, which are foreign to the island—chalk, chalk-flints, oolitic
limestone, oolitic breccia, dark limestone of Calciferous-sandstone
 age, quartzites, gneiss, &c., some of which closely resemble the
 representatives of these formations on the east of Scotland, and
have doubtless been derived thence.       From this they infer that,
while Shetland was glaciated by the Scandinavian mer de glace,
 Orkney was glaciated by the Scotch ice-sheet, the respective ice
 sheets having coalesced on the floor of the North Sea and moved in
 a north-westerly direction towards the Atlantic.
    They also found abundant fragments of marine shells in most of
the Boulder-clay sections, which are smoothed and striated precisely
like the stones in that deposit.  They conclude that these organisms
lived in the North Sea prior to the great extension of the ice, and                                                <
that their remains were commingled with the moraine profonde
as the ice-sheet crept over the ocean-bed.        From the marked
absence of shell-fragments in the Shetland Boulder-clay, they are
inclined to believe that much of the present sea-floor round that
group of islands formed dry land during the climax of glacial cold.

   This being the case, let us, at the time of full moon, choose a
place of observation sufficiently open, but where there is at least one
wall, illuminated either by the moon or by street-lamps. If the

if,   onthe contrary, the image appears larger, and recommence the
experiment, until we judge the two diameters equal. This equality
evidently demands that we refer the accidental image                         the same                        to
distance        the luminary; therefore

In   the second     place,   we   may     mistaken  be     the idea we form  in    our                             of

     measured from the point determined as have said, was found to              I
     be 51 metres.    Therefore, under the conditions of the experiment,
     my son instinctively placed the moon in the sky at about fifty
     metres from him.
        That distance will doubtless appear very little; but it is given by
     the experiment.    This, however, ought to be repeated—for which
     purpose it is not indispensable that the moon be full; but it is ne
     cessary that the moon pass the meridian at a favourable time, and,
     further, that the sky be quite calm and clear—circumstances not at
     our command. Perhaps the hand concealing the houses diminished
     the apparent distance; an observer residing in the country would

                          FIG-TREE.       BY M. BOUCHUT.
                                        I
    The researches which and M. Ad. Wurtz presented to the Aca:
demy, on the digestive action of the juice of Carica papaya, and
of the digestive ferment (papaine) which it contains, have induced
me to see if that was not a fact connected with a general carnivorous
property of the latew of many other plants.                 Special studies, care
fully made, in that direction compel me to think so; and now,
at least, the thing seems demonstrated by the milky juice of the
common fig-tree.
    This juice is not very copious,                          its
                                                  collection slow and difficult;

             OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAPOUR-DENSITY OF IODINE.
                           BY M. BERTHELOT.
   In the abstract theory of gases it is assumed that the simple
gases receive simultaneously one and the same increment of total
energy and one and the same increment of vis viva of translation
when they undergo one and the same change of temperature. This
 conception translates the experiments of physicists on the specific
 heat of gases (the law of Dulong and Petit), their expansion by heat
 (Gay-Lussac's law), and their compressibility (Mariotte's law).
 * Again, it is concluded from the two latter laws that the density
of a gas (that       is,

The deviations hitherto observed have been attributed              secondary                  to
perturbations.
    These three laws have really been demonstrated for three ele
ments only (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen); they constitute the only
scientific foundation            on

present theories rests.         for certain elements these laws were

under the same conditions, in the molecules of air. The laws of
Mariotte and Gay-Lussac, established solely upon three simple
gases, are therefore inapplicable either to iodine or to the other
halogen elements.
   This is the place to mention that the law of specific heats is
no more applicable than the above-mentioned to this group of ele
ments; for the specific heats of gaseous chlorine and bromine exceed
by one fourth those of the other simple gases, and that between the
ordinary temperature and 200°C., temperatures at which dissocia
tion cannot be admitted.
   It hence follows that the increase of the total energy of the halo
gen gases with the temperature exceeds that of the three other
simple gases hitherto investigated (nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen), as
well as the increase of the vis viva of translation: these two orders
of effects seem to be correlative.
   Moreover, the diminution of density of iodine gas being progres
sive, the same is the case with the augmentation of           vis viva                    its                of
translation; and,     M. Troost very judiciously remarks, this does
                           as
not permit       usdraw any correct conclusion respecting the varia

                           of                        reasoning becomes         of

   These results show that the vapour-density of iodine, calculated
with a-0.00367 and PW=1, diminishes quite as much at a low as
at a high temperature.
   All the hypotheses which have been framed on the assumption
of either a dissociation of, or isomeric change in, iodine henceforth
appear to me hardly admissible.      In the present state of our know
ledge, nothing authorizes us to suppose that a partial vacuum would
be adequate to produce a modification of that nature.           The only
necessary consequences of the experiments made at high tempera
tures or at low pressures are, that the expansion-coefficient of
iodine varies with the temperature, and that          coefficient   com                 its                      of
pressibility varies with the pressure.       Every hypothesis proposed
in order      explain these results will have
              to                                  take into account this        to

small quantity of concentrated sulphuric acid to protect the terminal
surfaces of the mercury from oxidation.
   In order to employ this apparatus for the study of the pheno
mena of radiant heat, a polished brass cone is placed inside at a
short distance from the bulb, the diathermanous substances to be
investigated being fixed between the small aperture of the cone and
the bulb.: the heat of a wax taper, sent back by a small reflector,
suffices for most experiments. The absorptive and emissive powers
of the various substances are easily studied by preparing a certain
number of small disks of copper (such as the circular copper plates
of a Volta pile); each disk is coated on one side with lampblack,
on the other with the substance whose absorbing-power is to be de
termined.       All the disks being heated together in a metal vessel,
we have     only   to place them successively at the same distance from
the   bulb,  the substance to be studied facing the bulb, in order to
determine the emissive powers.

                    on a liquid enclosed in a vessel adapted to the
     purpose, was to convert it into vapour at a volume a little
     more than twice that which it originally possessed. Within
     a certain limit he found the temperature at which this change
     occurred was independent of the ratio existing between the
     volume of the liquid and that of the tube, but        that limit
     the conversion was first observed at a higher temperature.
                                                                                        ..
     Brünner f, after an extensive discussion of previous memoirs,
     states the results of his observations upon the decrease which
     heat produced in the height to which water, ether, and olive
     oil rose in capillary tubes.  He experimented at temperatures
     below 100°C. In 1857, from Brünner's expression for this
     decrease in the case of ether, Wolf S calculated the tempera
     ture at which the level of the liquid in the capillary tube
     should coincide with that outside        and    the attempt       it;         in                          to

   Two methods of heating will be noticed in this paper. The
first consists merely in heating a large test-tube of                  over                         oil          a
rose gas-burner, the experimental tube being suspended verti

and the results show that the heating, although rapid,                nearly,                       is
if not quite, uniform.               worth notice, however, that

three or four degrees of the critical ; the glass stop-cock (c) is
then closed, and the pressure of the expanding air in the flask
begins to raise the mercury until it meets the platinum tube
(e) of the regulator, which is previously screwed down till
within about 3 millims. of the surface of the mercury. Some
two or three hours later the critical temperature is reached.
The light from a paraffin lamp passes through a cylindrical lens,
and enters through one of the glass windows in the case en
closing the apparatus, thus rendering the experimental tube
visible through the other window. The observations are made
with a cathetometer-telescope.
   Early in this inquiry it was found that so many circum
stances influenced the depth to which the liquid was depressed
in the capillary tube, that two different tubes could be satis
factorily compared only when enclosed in the same external
tube; and if the effects of slow and rapid heating are to be
compared, the tubes should be of the same thickness of glass.

heating is rapid, the depression in a capillary tube the im
         half of which has been previously heated and drawn
out until the diameter is very small is less than it is in the
corresponding tube of uniform diameter throughout.           Slow
heating reverses this result, as shown in fig. 3. By the mere
contraction of the extreme end of the immersed part of a
capillary tube the depression is almost uninfluenced. The
results above described are not invariable (and some points
connected with them are still the subject of inquiry); but
under conditions which are apparently the most free from
error they become sufficiently so to justify their being regarded
as normal.
   It seems probable that the effects of unequal and irregular
heating are completely removed from the above experiments;
for the liquid is equally depressed in two capillary tubes of
equal diameter, one made of very thick, and the other of very
thin glass. Rapidly heated, the depression reaches a maximum
in the thick glass tube. Of two similar capillary tubes the
most deeply immersed always shows the deepest depression;
but the   "...
without influence.
                   of the tube above the liquid is apparently
                        This led to the result described to the
Society in June 1879, viz. that when the capillary tube does
not dip more than a millimetre or two below the surface the
liquid disappears at the same level in the capillary and external
tubes.
   It  has been previously stated that the liquid sometimes
appears convex near the critical temperature.      With ether in a
tube 20 millims. in diameter, this apparent convexity is so well
               I
marked that had at first much difficulty in satisfying myself
that such was not the case. By means of a lamp, cylindrical
lens, and slit, a bright line of light is easily thrown into the
                                  ...i
liquid in such a tube heated in a large beaker of oil. The
changes in the form of the                  image were then ob
served ; and from this it was inferred that when the liquid
surface appears convex and well-defined, as seen through the
horizontal telescope, it is slightly but unmistakably concave,
and remains so until it loses the power of reflecting when it is
plane. This apparent convexity is caused by the raising of
the far edge of the liquid by refraction; or perhaps it may
resemble mirage, as    I have distinctly seen the surface of the
liquid in the horizontal telescope. The surface subsequently
becomes black and ill-defined, and, as Professor McLeod has
 pointed out to me, closely resembles the surface of alcohol and
 water in a test-tube into which they have been carefully poured
 so as not to mix.    The band of light which leaves the cylin
 drical lens, and passes through the vertical tube of ether, gives

                  and Gases near their Critical Temperatures.                                           153
rise to some remarkable refraction figures at the surface of
the liquid.      By substituting the test-tube of alcohol and water
for the tube of ether, corresponding figures are obtained—
heat in one case, and diffusion in the other, causing these
figures to pass through the same changes.                  It appears possible
that the black surface        may     be due to the    mixing       of the liquid
ether with             its
                    vapour    when     they  are      nearly      of
                                                                 equal    density.
This view receives some support from the fact that just before
the defined surface                 the liquid

 shorter period merely sufficed to diminish the depression.
 Probably closely connected with this action is the gradual
 decrease Quincke " has observed that time produces in the
 form of a bubble of gas in a liquid, and of a drop of mercury.
To this class of facts are also nearly related the decrease in
the intensity of Quincke's f electrical diaphragm-currents,
and that which f        I
                      have shown to take place in the electro
motive force produced when water is forced through capillary
tubes.    Elster § has recently extended the observation to a
similar variation in the electromotive force set up by liquids
flowing over the surfaces of solids. Dorn|| has investigated
at some length the cause of this action in the case of tubes,
and has shown that it is capable of modification in various ways,
some of which appear capable of exercising a corresponding
control over the above-described depression of a liquid in a
capillary tube at a temperature near the critical.
    t is proposed to continue the still incomplete portions of
this inquiry in a paper to the Society next session.
   In conclusion      H.leave to express my thanks to Professor
McLeod, not only for having advised me to extend my obser
vations to higher temperatures than those at first employed,
but also for the willingness he has always shown to aid me
with valuable suggestions.
                        Summary       of   Contents.
   1. When a tube enclosing a capillary tube dipping into
alcohol, ether, or sulphurous anhydride is heated, the
sinks in the capillary, and rises by expansion in the outer
                                                                     ‘i.
tube. Between 2° and 3°C. below the critical temperatures of
these liquids both surfaces become level; and on continuing
to heat, the concave meniscus in the capillary tube is seen
below that in the external tube.         The extent of this de
pression depends on the diameter &c. of the capillary tube,
and on the nature of its internal surface. When the end of
a capillary tube dips very slightly below the surface of the
liquid, it is level in the capillary and external tubes at the
disappearance of the liquid.
   2. In some capillary tubes the liquid is not depressed, but
disappears at the level of the liquid in which they are immersed
on first heating. Once heated, long contact between liquid
and tube is necessary to prevent the formation of the depression

on again heating.    For two tubes which were examined, this
time was in each case about 20 hours; a shorter period
merely sufficed to diminish the depresion.      The depression is
the result of an action between the liquid and the inner glass
surface of the capillary tube.
   3. Indications that surfaces exercise a slight action in deter
mining the position at which the liquid condenses in the ex
ternal tube have been observed.
   4. By reflecting a bright line of light from the apparently
convex and well-defined surface of ether in a tube of 20 millims.
diameter at a temperature near the critical, it may be inferred
to remain concave until it loses the power of reflecting when
it is plane. The apparent convexity is the result of refraction,
or, perhaps, of an action resembling mirage.
   5. The black ill-defined band which immediately succeeds
the disappearance    of the liquid surface is the result of too
rapid heating, and possibly due to the mixing of liquid and
vapour when they are of nearly equal density. When very
slowly heated, as described, the defined concave surface is gra
dually obliterated, and is last seen as a fine and often waving
line.    Under this condition also the volume of the liquid at                                     its

  The problem thus solved is the finding of the periodic disturb
ance  in the motion of rotating liquid in a space between two
boundaries which are concentric circular cylindric when un
disturbed, produced by infinitely small simple harmonic normal
motion of these boundaries, distributed over them accordin
to the simple harmonic law in respect to the coordinates 2,                                         §
The most interesting Subcase is had by supposing the inner
boundary evanescent (a =0), and the liquid continuous and
undisturbed throughout the space contained by the outer cy
lindric boundary of radius a. This, as is easily seen, makes
wa0 when r=0, except for the case                and essentially,  i-1,
without exception, requires that c be zero.    Thus the solution
for w becomes

certainly ingenious, and for verifying analytical solutions of
easy and elementary problems it would,        think, be useful in   I
the hands of a teacher; but                      I

                            From (2) we learn that we may
infer that both X and Y or neither of them have happened

more) has happened ; while (3) informs us that the combi
nations AC, AD, BC, BD are impossible.
  Other inferences, besides                         those     required, may easily be
drawn.  For instance, since

   An inspection of these results, knowing that the specific
heat of brass is about three times that of mercury, will show
that the principle of the instrument is experimentally verified.
The bore of the thermometer-tube being, unfortunately, large,
necessitated a small rise; greater accuracy hence could not be
expected.    It is hoped shortly, however, to make further expe
riments with a new instrument having a much smaller bore,
and with other needed improvements that could not in a first
instrument be foreseen as wanting.

  (1) The production of light by an electric ray from           the nega
tive   pole  in  highly  rarefied  gas  takes  place  only  when the ray
strikes   upon    a solid obstacle.
    (2) It is not the whole length of the ray which produces the
light, but only the end of it furthest from the negative pole.
    Both of these statements (whose complete experimental
proof cannot be here described) may be easily verified by cut
ting off a sharply-defined pencil of light from the mass of light
from the negative pole by means of a screen with a small open
                                  º'.
ing.     If a fluorescent screen be caused to approach such a
pencil sideways, no fluorescence is observed, however close the
approach, whether the end of the pencil strike upon a solid
wall and cause fluorescence there or not.
    (3) The cause of the production of light is to be sought in an
optical action.
    This may be concluded with much probability from the
identity of colour given by a series of different substances

It follows with       greater  certainty from the fact that fluorescent
screens are actually excited when they are so placed in the
interior of the tubes that they are protected from the rectili
near radiation of rays from the                         but are exposed
to rectilinear radiation from those             portions    of the walls
 upon which the electric rays impinge.               Such screens shine
 out with their own peculiar light when distant about 1 cen

    These and similar appearances were inexplicable as long as
the production of light on the walls was ascribed to optical
radiation from the whole mass of gas or from the whole length
of the electric rays, which could never have produced sharp
images, but only uniform illumination of the walls.                   On the
other hand, the action of the ends of the rays as opposed to the
rest of their length, which is now made clear, explains the whole

of the observed phenomena at once.
    The optical character of the action in question is confirmed
by the existence of photochemical action, which, again, is ex
erted by the ends of the rays, and not by their whole length.
 Substances which are decomposed under the influence of solar
rays of high refrangibility are decomposed in the same way
 when the ends of the rays fall upon them.               succeeded, by way  I
 of control of statements (2) and (3), in obtaining direct pho

                        have called attention", of isochronism in
 the discharge of such tubes.        Observation shows that when
 the negative rays in one of the tubes excite the luminosity of
 solid bodies, this is not necessarily the case in the others; but
 they also exhibit the appearance as soon as they are brought
 to the same degree of exhaustion as the tube which first be
 came luminous.
    It follows from this that, in the modification described, the
whole of the light about the kathode becomes surrounded with
an exterior heterogeneous layer. The position of this new
layer is dependent solely upon the position of the wall of the
tube, and can be brought into any desired position at any given
distance from the kathode by moving the wall to or from the
kathode, while the pressure remains constant.           It may even
be caused to   pass,  still formed by  the ends of the rays, through
the outer    layer  of the    kathode-light  into one of the inner
layers.
   % am not yet in a position to explain the production of this
modification of the rays.
    (7) The same differentiation occurs with the “secondary ne
gative light,” a name given by me to the light produced at
 any point of the discharge at which a contraction of the tube
is introduced. A mass of light then spreads out from the
point where the tube is contracted into the wider portion
towards the anode, which possesses, only in a less degree,                                         all

  180                Dr. E. Goldstein on the Electric
  return current does not cause the least appearance of light,
  although it is present in the same medium, and certainly not
   of greater section than the direct current which fills the whole
  width of the tube.       Any manifestation of light due to it must
  become visible when the direct current is diverted by the
  action of the magnet to one side of the tube.                In the space
  thus rendered     free, any   possible    luminous effect of the return
  stream would show itself.         Experiment proves, however, that
  this space is dark.
      (4) Let the kathode a be again a plane, whose direction is
  parallel to and contains the axis of the cylinder.              Then the
  negative rays, as is always the case, are almost entirely at right
  angles to the radiating surface, and directed towards the sides
  of the tube. When the pressure is somewhat high, the rays
  end in free space before they reach the wall; but with smaller
  densities, as soon as they strike on the solid wall.
      The phenomena are altogether correspondent when (5) the
  kathode, as is most frequently the case, is formed by a wire in
  the axis of the tube.      Here also the rays are directed towards
  the sides of the tube, and in a particular case are radial in each
  section of the cylinder.
r     The electricity must therefore first traverse the direction of
  the negative rays to their termination, and then take a path at
  right angles to it in order to reach the anode; whilst, again,
  both positive and negative light have the same properties as
  in the preceding cases, when we assumed either direct trans
   ference or a direct and return current.
      The complexity of the assumptions necessary in supposing
  that the current (following always the direction of the negative
  current) propagates itself from the negative light into the first
  stratum of the positive, from this into the second, and so on
  till the anode is reached, becomes still greater when account
  is taken of the existence of the dark space between the posi
  tive and negative light.
      In the preceding cases the dark space has not been men
  tioned; it invariably disappears at a certain exhaustion ; and
  for the sake of simplicity I have described the phenomena cor
  responding to that exhaustion.
       f the kathode is again a plane (a) at right angles to the
  axis of the cylinder, the anode an electrode (b) of any form at
  the opposite end of the tube, the phenomena of discharge
  when the dark space is present correspond to fig. 4*.
     * The variously coloured layers of the negative light are represented in
 the figures by different shading: the layer nearest the kathode is chamois
 yellow, the next sky-blue; and the third, which forms the chief portion of
 the light, is blue with a shade of violet,    Between the layers of positive

   The dark space does not represent, as has been often assumed,
the prolongation of the negative rays which have lost in
brightness in consequence of their expansion. The negative
rays have the property of rectilinear radiation and are termi
nated by a solid wall; they cannot, therefore, turn a corner.
The appearances obtained with the discharge in bent tubes,
such as figs. 5 and 6, require therefore no further explana
tion to show that the dark space cannot be considered as a
continuation of the kathode-light, and that it possesses itself
no property of rectilinear radiation.
     If,
       therefore, we assume that the current           the kathode            of
light propagates itself     the first positive layer,
                                       to                  necessary               it

to suppose that the current between the two           changed for             is                       a
certain distance into     new form.a
   Returning      the straight
                        to      tube (fig. 4),     we continue the       if
exhaustion further from the point            which the dark space  at
makes        its
           appearance, the positive layers retreat slowly towards
the anode        the same time the rays

We thus reach       point    a which the dark space disappears,

at extremely small densities.   But the kathode-light extends
through the whole vessel, without being influenced by the
proximity of the anode, so far as rectilinear rays radiating from
a can reach. A bundle of rays penetrates into the widest of the
three cylinders (Zs), whose diameter is determined by that of
the communicating opening between the cylinders. When
the exhaustion is continued, the bundle penetrates as far as
the wall B, and the ends of the rays excite there bright green
phosphorescence    in the form of a circular disk, which is the
section of the bundle of rays by the wall B.                 If

connected from the induction-coil, and the electrode b in the
second be made the anode while a remains the kathode, then
there appears, as represented in the figure, a long stratified
column of positive light, beginning several centimetres from
the mouth of Zi, completely filling Z, and reaching to the
            Zs remains, as before, free from positive light; but

thode whose rays have some other direction than those issuing
from a. The quantitative differences which the positive and
negative light show remain when they mix, as if in the space
which they together fill each had separate and independent
existence.
   The assumption that the discharge from the negative light
propagates    itself into the positive layer next the negative pole,

assumption that the discharge in the last-considered phase,

186                           Dr. E. Goldstein             on the Electric
     We have  seen that a kathode may be regarded as a system
of fine  conducting   pores in a non-conducting surface.         The
kathode light must then consist of rays which possess the pro
perties of the light of very narrow tubes; and in fact not only
does the colour of the kathode-rays agree with the blue of
narrow tubes, but the spectrum of the kathode-light consists
precisely of the same four bands, with the same maxima of
light, as that of the blue of the narrow tubes.
    The suspicion expressed on p. 183, as to the true character
of an apparently simple discharge between two metallic
electrodes appears to be supported by the mode of action of
the magnet upon the discharge.      It follows, in fact, from it that
each   negative bundle,  as well as each positive layer, constitutes
a whole in itself.
    Each negative bundle, in fact, kathode-light as well as
secondary negative light, as well as each separate layer of
                                                                i.
positive light, upon being magnetized rolls itself together
to a single magnetic curve by itself, altogether independently
of the extent occupied in the unmagnetized condition by the
bundles and layers. A negative                    30 centims. long
forms only a single magnetic curve, just the same as a layer
of 2 millims, length."
    In the same way the bundle issuing from a given point,
which when of a certain length forms a single curve, when by
 exhaustion it is brought to a length three times, five times, or
             º
 ten times as great, gives always only a single curve, inasmuch
 as the bundle, for example, in the equatorial position with
 reference to the magnet rolls itself together from the ends of
    * The          curves formed from the positive light may be clearly
distinguished for a considerable distance in the neighbourhood of the
 kathode, and in the neighbourhood of secondary negative poles, as in
fig, 9.
 *That they are not to be perceived in like manner in the remainder of
the deflected positive light is to be explained, as      have remarked in the I
Monatsber d. Akad. 1876, p. 282, by the curvature of the wall of the
vessels commonly employed. . The disturbing forces exerted by the
magnet drive the discharge, and consequently the magnetic curves com

          or                      We shall then                                       to be

                                 application, and      frame tables for
its  employment.
    Having given known power  a                               of
                                              unknown number (call   an
it  n'"), we subtract successively the terms             series, and find          of  a
for last remainder the required root
      a                                           Obviously this seriesn.
is  the one whose sum               terms =n"—n; and obviously,
                                            to    n

                              Evolution by Subtraction.                 193
 again, this series is the one whose general term
                   u,-(n"—n)– {(n-1)"-(n-1)}.
 If we substitute 1, 2, 3, &c. for n in this formula, we shall ob
 tain the successive subtrahends for any given index m.
    No confusion need be apprehended from the double sense
in which I am using the symbol n, to indicate both the required
root and the ordinal number of each term in the series; for
during the operation the value of the root is unknown to us,
and we substitute the integers successively in the hope of find
ing it; and a consideration of the series will show that the
number of terms required is in every case =n, including the
zero term for n = 1.
   The general term as given above is not yet in a form adapted
for simple arithmetical calculation, except for very low values
both of m and n ; but by expansion we may cast it into a form
capable of resolution into factors in such a way as to make
the calculation easier.   For
       (n"—n)– (n-1)*-(n-1)} =n"—1-(n-1)";
which, expanded by the Binomial Theorem, the highest powers
of n cancelling, leaves us
       u, = –1 +mn"-" — m/m-1)n"-" +&c.--mn-F1.
Here,    if m     be even, the last term is    -1, and the expression   for
       u,-24–1+}      mn(n"-"—#(m—1)n”----&c.
                                         —#(m—1)n+1)};
if m   be odd, the last term is +1, which cancels, and the ex
pression becomes
       u,-mn(n"-"—#(m— 1)n"-*--&c.-- #(m—1)n-1).
In   this latter case the quantity within the bracket will always
be divisible by (n-1), as may be seen by an inspection of the
coefficients.    So far, then, the method appears to favour the
odd indices, which might have been expected to present the
greatest difficulty; and an even index, if not a power of 2,
may be reduced to an odd one by one or more operations for
the square root.
   But an alternative rule offers itself, of making each term of
the subtrahend series to be itself the sum of a series.    Such a
series will of course be that of the differences of successive
subtrahends; and in working we shall have to add to each
term the last preceding subtrahend, which will have been the
sum of      all
              the previous terms.   The general term         of
                                                       this series
will   be unti–ua. Now this      expression
              =(n+1)"—1—n"— {n"—1-(n-1)";

   The first term of this addition is cancelled by the -2n”;
the expression will accordingly be the double of the positive

All   these coefficients are integral. When m is even, they will
recur in reverse order, like those of the Binomial Theorem,

   Let these examples suffice; we have reached a point at
which the formulae begin to have a complicated appearance,
though the practical working of them is not beyond the capa
city of a child, and already we have made a great advance on
the results of the older methods.         We may already perceive
from our    investigation    that the formulae for unti–wn are of
most use in simplifying results for the lower indices; but that
as we go higher we can more safely rely on the formulae for un
which more closely follow the Binomial Theorem, and                                                     so,

198                         The Rev. F. H. Hummel on
  Having now the actual numbers before us, we can verify in
fact the relation which we may find from the algebraic for
mulae to exist between the terms of consecutive series.    De
noting the number of a series by a bracketed index, we may
write this relation thus: wº"+")=nu<U+017F>"+         +2(n-1); the                 Sº,
nth term of any series = n times the nth term of the preceding
series + the sum of the (n-1) previous terms of that series
 +twice (n-1). Thus, having given five terms of the 6th
series, the 5th term of the 7th series will be
            5    x 11528+62 + 664+3366+ 2 x 4 = 61740.
By this formula we may extend our tables to any number of
series, and to any number of terms in each.
   We may notice in passing the recurrence of final digits of
every five terms of each series, repeated in every group of four
series, thus:
           m=4p, 0,4,4,4,8;      ma 4p-H 1, 0,0,0,0,0;
           m=4p--2, 0,2,4,6,8;      ma 4p--3, 0, 6, 8, 6,0.
So the     sum of 5p or 5p + 1 terms in every series, and of 5p–1
terms of the odd series, have zero for the final digit, as would
be necessary for powers of numbers of the form 5p or 5p-E1.
All the terms of each series are even numbers, as we might
have foreseen from the algebraic formulae.    This, too, was ne
cessary; for the powers of odd numbers being            odd, and                           all
those      of
         even numbers all even, n”—n          every case even.         is   in
      Somuch, then, for the mode       constructing the subtrahend

to look even for an approximation to the required root, as a
general rule. But our investigation of the series has shown
us that n”—n is always the sum of n terms; and consequently,
in approximating to the mth root of nº"+d, we can discover n
at once by counting the number of terms subtracted.     It must
be remembered that the first term is in every case zero, and
therefore the number of actual subtractions we have performed
will be n—1.
    Having thus found n, which is so far an approximation to
the required root, we may now obtain a nearer approximation
by the help of the last remainder, which we have seen to be
n+d. For we can now determine the value and sign of d by
subtracting n from the last remainder, and we know that our
given number is n' -- d. There are, of course, known methods
by which the mth root of n”--d may be pretty accurately
 found; but, omitting these, let me point out that this method
 itself will furnish a means of approximating tolerably nearly
 to the root, by adding to n (or, if the sign of d prove to be

IN    theory of the reversal of the photographic image on de
velopment, showing that it was due to oxidation when ordina
rily met with. On looking back, however, to the Philoso
phical Transactions for 1840, I find Sir J. Herschel gave a de
scription of a similar phenomenon which perhaps might admit
of a different explanation. This subject examined some time        I
ago; and since the whole question seems to have revived in
interest, it has seemed an opportune moment to put on record
my more recent investigations.                       I
                                           need scarcely say that the
fact as to the reversal of the     image    is any thing but new, as
will be seen from Herschel's,           Hunt's,   and Draper's well
known works. The explanation, however, as far as
                                                                    know,                      I

    The above experiments show, then, that a reversal may be
obtained by the presence of the iodides or bromides (and in a
                                      I
more feeble Inanner, have also found, by that of the chlorides),
and also by oxidizing agents and mineral acids; whilst the
  resence of a deoxidizing agent, or the exposure of the plate
in a medium free from oxygen, prevents the occurrence of the
phenomenon.
  We shall consider shortly as to whether the reversing action
depends upon the sensitiveness of the salt of silver obtained
by the preliminary exposure, or upon that of the agents em
  oyed in effecting such reversal.
  With the bromide of silver we have rather different phases
of the phenomenon to consider. The development can be
carried out with the alkaline or the ferrous oxalate developer,
a mode which is more easy to carry out than the development
by precipitation of metallic silver from an aqueous solution of
silver nitrate. For experimental purposes, films containing
silver bromide may be formed of collodion or of gelatine;
and the behaviour of the silver-salt in the two vehicles is
somewhat different, and has to be considered separately. Col
lodion         is,     or
                   should be,     strictly neutral substance; that                                                     is,

          Bennett described                these phenomena                   in   the ‘British Journal             of
Photography’   1878, in

 that the phenomena are absent, a reversal being almost impos
sible to obtain unless the length of exposure be such as to
 thoroughly oxidize the nitrite at the expense of gelatine. For
 ordinary purposes it may be said that a reversal is non-existent
 under these conditions.
     Ifa plate be exposed in benzene, however (a liquid which
 does not permeate through gelatine), the phenomena are still
 existent.        If
                a plate be exposed to such an extent that there
is a marked    image   apparent before development, and be then
 immersed in    water,  it will be found that when the image
appears the gelatine refuses to swell to the same extent that
it does when the light has not acted. Taking these two expe
riments together, it is evident that the gelatine has played
some part with the silver bromide.         It may therefore be
presumed that the three last phenomena are due, the 1st to
the oxidation of the surface-particles of the bromide and a
consequent change in colour, the 2nd to the change in colour
of these particles permitting the coloured rays to which it is
sensitive to strike a deeper layer, and the 3rd to the oxidation
of this layer at the expense of the gelatine. The 3rd and 4th
phenomena are so unimportant that they are scarcely worth
investigating.    The presence of organic matter is evidently
necessary for their appearance; at least                 I
                                               have never been
able to obtain them with collodion films not containing a pre
servative.
   As     before, the experiment
                                   ...      of saturating one of these gela
tine films with bicromate of potash shows that the reversing
action is very much                by the presence of the oxidizing
agent. Mr. Bolas" has recently described a plan of producing
reversed negatives by allowing the bichromate to dry in the
film, which is a practical application of this reversing action
of light in the presence of an oxidizing agent.
   A convenient method of showing these phenomena on the
same plate is to use a screen containing squares of gradu
ated opacity, as suggested by the editor of the “Photographic
News, or such as the sensitometer prepared by Mr. Warnerke,
and procurable at most photographic warehouses.
   Having treated of these reversals of the image in a general
way, it now remains to show which radiations are effective in
producing them.        For testing this, spectro-photography was
resorted        to,

red and in the blue, a portion of the spectrum in the green
and yellow remaining unreversed (fig. 6). Now the action of
these acids is not a strictly oxidizing action, but is probably a
removal of the loose atoms of the silver which goes to form the
subiodide, and leaving silver iodide behind as the result of the
action. The results of the action of acids do not, therefore,
vitiate the above deduction. A plate exposed in benzene or in
nitrite of potash showed no reversal even with a very prolonged
exposure.      It  should be remarked that the action of perman
ganate and bichromate of potash when very feeble is sometimes
to give feeble negative images in the red and blue in lieu of
positive images; also positive images in the blue, and feeble
negative images in the red (see dotted curves in figs. 4 and 5).
 But this is to be accounted for by the fact that the dilution
of these oxidizing agents is so extreme that the reducing action
on the unaltered sensitive salt is far greater than the rapidity
 of the oxidation".
    Ordinary bromide of silver in collodion or gelatine may be
taken as giving almost identical results under the influence of
 a soluble bromidef.         Now ordinary bromide is sensitive as far
 as B (see dotted    curve,   Pl.VI. fig. 7); and it might be presumed
 that this sensitiveness to the rays of lower refrangibility would
 cause a modification in the action of the soluble bromide. A
 reference to figures 7 and 8 will show that this is the case,
 but that at the same time the features which are so marked with
 the action of bromide on silver iodide are present.             Fig. 7 is the
 curves due to silver bromide in collodion which had received a
 preliminary exposure and was then exposed in a 5-per-cent.
 solution of acid potassium bromide. It will be seen that the
 curves in figures 7 and 2 are similar, showing that the principal
 action is due to light acting on the soluble bromide in the
 presence of an acid. Fig. 8 is a similar plate exposed in an
 alkaline solution of KBr, in which there is a modification of the
 curve. The last loop is probably due to the silver subbromide
 itself, since the oxidation of this salt by oxidizing agents oc
 cupies approximately the same position (see fig. 10).
    #.      9 shows the effect of permanganate             of potash; and
 when it is compared with fig. 10, which is the curve due to

ON THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY                     MIXING WHITE WITH COLOURED
      LIGHT,     BY PROF. o. N. RooD,                     of    Columbia CoI.LEGE.
  T   was noticed several years ago that when white light was mixed
    by the method of rotating disks with light of an ultramarine (arti
ficial) hue, the result was not what one would naturally have ex
pected; viz. instead of obtaining a lighter or paler tint of violet
blue, the colour inclined decidedly toward violet, passing, when
much white was added, into a pale violet hue.      Two attempts have
been made to account for this curious fact. -Brücke supposes that
the light which we call white is really to a considerable extent red,
and that the mixture of this reddish-white light with the blue
causes it to change to violet.   Aubert, on the other hand, following
a suggestion    of Helmholtz,  reaches the conclusion that violet is
really only a lighter shade of ultramarine-blue.    He starts with the
assumption that we obtain our idea of blue mixed with white from
the sky, which, according to him, is of a greenish-blue colour. We
then apply, as he thinks, this idea to the case of a blue which is
not greenish, namely to ultramarine-blue, and are surprised to find
that the result is different.
   It will be shown in the present paper that these explanations are
hardly correct, since they fail to account for the changes which,
according to my experiments, are produced in other colours by an
admixture of white.            I
                          prepared a set of brilliantly coloured cir
cular disks which represented                all
                                    the principal colours    the spec                    of
trum and also purple; these disks were then successively combined
in  various proportions with     white disk, and the effects

rotation noted,    smaller duplicate coloured disk uncombined with
                    a

                                                                                -

was found that the addition      white produced the changes indicated

are disposed symmetrically about this line as an axis. These ex
periments serve to explain the singular circumstance, that when
complementary colours are produced by the aid of polarized light,
 it is difficult or impossible to obtain a red which is entirely free
 from a purplish hue, a quantity of white light being always ne
 cessarily mingled with the coloured light.       In the case of the red,
 orange, yellow, ultramarine, and purple disks,      I succeeded in mea
 suring the amount of violet light which different proportions of the
 white disk virtually added to the mixture, and found that it was not
 directly proportional to the amount of white light added, but in
 creased in a slower ratio, which at present has not been accurately
 determined.
      For the explanation of the above-mentioned phenomena, Brücke's
  suggestion that white light contains a certain amount of unneutra
  lized red light is evidently inapplicable, since the effects are such
  as would be produced by adding a quantity not of red but of violet
                                I
  light; and for the present am not disposed to assume that white
  light contains an excess of violet light. The explanation offered
  by Aubert does not undertake to account for the changes produced
  in colours other than ultramarine, and even in this case seems to
..me arbitrary; neither have     I succeeded in framing any explanation
  in accordance with the theory of Young and Helmholtz which
  seems plausible.—Silliman's American Journal, August 1880.
   ON   THE ABSORPTION OF RADIANT HEAT BY GASES AND WAPOURS.
                        BY MM. LECHER AND PERNTER.
      The authors discuss the different methods previously employed
   in similar investigations, and in particular the arrangements em
   ployed by Tyndall, and the vapour-adhesion to which they are liable,
   and show from numbers given by Tyndall himself how important a
   source of error this may become.      Tyndall's results often differ by
   30 per cent, according as the whole or only half of the experimental
   tube was polished.
      There is scarcely any other reason to be found for this difference
   than vapour-adhesion. That a condensation of vapour along the
   walls of the tube took place may be shown directly by comparing
   Tyndall's observations in which the vapour-pressure was measured
   directly, with those in which the experimental tube was filled with
   vapour by being repeatedly placed in communication with a flask
    containing the corresponding vapour in a state of saturation. We
    can conclude from the absorption observed what the pressure must
    be in the flask.    We find thus for benzol-vapour, for example, a
   tension of two    atmospheres,  which corresponds to a temperature of
    100° C. But as the temperature in fact was 11°C., the excess of
   vapour must have resulted from precipitated liquid on the sides of

       The authors were led by these considerations, and by experience
    obtained from numerous failures, to adopt finally an arrangement
    in which the thermopile and source of heat were placed in the same
    vessel.  The influence of currents of air is rendered imperceptible

by bringing the radiating surface suddenly to 100° C. by a stream
of boiling water applied exteriorly.
   Of results must be mentioned, in the first place, that the absorp
tion of radiant heat by aqueous vapour, in opposition to Tyndall's
results, is found to be excessively small. The authors show that
the contradiction between this result and certain meteorological
observations is only apparent.
   The experiments made by Violle on Mont Blanc show that one
metre of the air at the place of observation absorbed only 0.007 per
cent. of the total radiation.                 If
                                         account is taken of the hygrometric
condition of the   air, and the difference in wave-length of the heat
experimented upon, we arrive at the conclusion that, taking Violle's
observations as correct, it would require a layer of 300 metres
of saturated aqueous vapour at 12° to produce the absorption of
radiant heat which Tyndall finds for a
this simple   calculation,  as well as       by   the
                                                            Y.of 1:22 metre. By
                                                         experimental results ob
tained, we may regard Magnus's view as established—that aqueous
vapour exerts hardly any absorption on radiant heat.
   The rest of the numbers obtained for gases agree fairly well with
those given by Tyndall (which of course is not the case with the
vapours examined).       At atmospheric pressure the intensity of the
radiation through a column of 310 millims, length (the intensity of
the incident radiation being 100) is for

   It appears, further, that there is no simple relation between
the absorption and the pressure of the substances experimented
upon; and the absorption, even for the radiation from a source of
heat at 100°, is a selective one. Hence too much importance is
not to be attributed to the relation which is pointed out in the
present paper between absorption and chemical composition, which
is as follows. After the absorption for vapours at equal pressure

       SPECTROSCOPIC RESEARCHES.          BY DR. G. L. CLAMICIAN.
    The author has      obtained the following results by the study of
 twenty elements :—
    I. Carbon has two spectra, one of the first and one of the second
 order, in accordance with the general rule that each element pos
 sesses two spectra.
     II.  Amongst carbon-compounds, only cyanogen, carbon-monoxide,
 and    acetylene have special spectra.
     III.  The  spectra  of the radicals cyanogen and carbonyl have a
 simple relation to the spectra of the first order of their compo
 nents. The most refrangible end of the carbonic-oxide and cyanogen
 spectra is homologous with that of the carbon spectrum of the first
 order.     On the other hand, the less refrangible half of the cyanogen
 spectrum is to be compared with that of the nitrogen spectrum of
 the first order.
    IV. The spectra of the second order of carbon, boron, silicon, and
 aluminium are homologous. It is to be remarked that the less
 refrangible end of the spectra of silicon and aluminium has nothing
 corresponding to it in the spectra of carbon and boron, and is com
 parable with the less refrangible portions of the spectra of the ele
 ments of the oxygen group.        Boron, silicon, and aluminium have
 also   spectra of the first order which correspond to the spectrum of
 carbon of the first order.
    W. The spectra of the first and second order of carbon and of
magnesium are completely homologous.
    VI. The more refrangible half of the homologous spectra of ba
rium, strontium, and calcium is homologous with the magnesium
 spectrum.
    VII. The spectra of the elements oxygen, sulphur, selenium, and
tellurium are completely homologous amongst themselves, both as
regards the more refrangible and the less refrangible halves.
       III. The spectra of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are to
be compared with the spectrum of nitrogen in the red portions;
and in like manner only the less refrangible portions of the spectra
of the halogens are homologous with the spectrum of fluorine.
    IX. The less refrangible end of the spectra of silicon, aluminium,
calcium, strontium, and barium is homologous with that of the
spectra of the elements of the oxygen group; and those elements
are more nearly comparable which form a horizontal line in Men
delejeff's table, e.g. sulphur, silicon, aluminium, calcium, selenium,
strontium and tellurium, barium.
    X. The more refrangible end of the spectra of chlorine, bromine,
iodine and phosphorus, arsenic and antimony, is homologous with
the more refrangible part of the spectra of the elements of the
oxygen group; the elements sulphur, chlorine, phosphorus, bro
mine, arsenic and tellurium, iodine, antimony are most nearly com
parable.
   From these relations of homology of the elements, and on

account of the homology mentioned (III.) of the spectra of cyanogen
and carbonic oxide with the spectra of their elements, we may con
clude that the ground of the homology of the spectra of the elements
is to be sought in the mode of their composition.
   From this hypothesis, in accordance with Mendelejeff's laws, the
following conclusions may be drawn:-
   The spectra of the elements carbon, boron, and magnesium are
completely homologous.       Hence these three elements consist of
similar material existing in different stages of condensation, which
find expression in the displacement of the homologous lines. The
atomic weights of boron and carbon are nearly the same; that of
magnesium is 24 = 2 x 12.
   The spectra of silicon and aluminium are homologous; and the
more refrangible portion corresponds to the spectrum of carbon, the
less refrangible portion to that of oxygen. Silicon consists, there
fore, of carbon and oxygen, with the corresponding atomic weight
12+16=28.
  Aluminium contains carbon in the form of boron (perhaps of
beryllium) and oxygen, as atomic weight its 11+16 indicates.        27=
   The elements     the group
                       of       alkaline earths have spectra whose

                 SOLID STEEL MAGNETS.     BY W. HOLTZ.

come to the opinion that solid steel bars do not in general furnish
good permanent magnets, because, on the one hand, the core absorbs
much of the magnetizing force already during the magnetization,
                                          I
and, next, because the core generally is to be regarded as an arma
ture joining the two poles".        consequently instituted some further
experiments, with steel tubes, which appeared, on the whole, to
confirm that view.
   Now, as the manufacture of such steel tubes presents no diffi
culty at all, but rather they can be had in larger picees at consider
ably lower prices than solid bars (for the tubes need not be bored,
but can be forged out of sheet-steel, since it is indifferent whether
the wall is perfectly closed or not), it did not seem superfluous, in
regard to the possibility of turning it to practical account, to draw
a more exact comparison between the action of such and ordinary
solid magnets.
   Now it is true that in the meantime                       I
                                                have learned that Nobili
ascertained that a small steel tube became permanently more pow
erfully magnetic than a solid rod of equal external dimensions.
According to the brief report in Poggendorff's Annalen, xxxiv.
p. 270 (1835)—the original memoir, unfortunately, not being ac
cessible to me—the rod weighed 28'5, and the tube 16 grams; in
spite of this the latter caused a deflection of a compass-needle of
19°, while the former produced one of only 9°5.            Still this expe
riment, apart from the dimensions of the pieces having been pro
portionally small and the want of a more exact determination of
the magnetisms, has hitherto remained isolated.            Hence       should                I
nevertheless like to describe in a few words the results of my own
experiments.
           I
   First employed a rod and a tube 124 centims, long and 13 mil
lims. in outside diameter. The thickness of the wall of the tube
amounted to 13 millim.         Both rod and tube were magnetized up to
saturation.    The    magnetisms    were tested by the oscillation method,
                                                   of its
the tube  being   loaded  throughout       whole length with copper. The
magnetism       of
                 the rod was          to
                                   that    the tube         1-6.            as   1:
I    next used      rod and
                      a          tubea             of
                                             centims.   32
                                                       length   and      mil                     35
lims. external diameter, while the thickness            the tube-wall wasof
the same as the above.          believe that here also both rod and tube
                                I
were   magnetized       saturation,
                          to         since     extraordinarily great mag

                               at                                    the rod            of
(tested    as
            above) was          to
                              that    the tubeof      1:5.        as   1

I    had,      truth, expected
               in                    greater difference
                                          a                  the latter case     in
than  in the former, because the core was                         so
                                                   much thicker, and this
circumstance would necessarily have great influence; but                 soon                I
reflected that the length        the core (the imaginary armature) must
                                     of
also have played          an

tubes under such circumstances scarcely obeyed the directing force
of the earth. This last experiment demonstrates, perhaps most
strikingly, how prejudicial to permanent steel magnets is the inte

   Postscript.—Six months having elapsed since the above-mentioned
comparison (which took place shortly after the magnetizing of the
rods and tubes in question), and the above communication having
already been delivered to the editors of the Annalen, it recently
struck me to compare the same magnets again, as it certainly was
probable that hollow magnets would retain their magnetism better
than solid ones. The result was such as to far exceed my expecta
                    I
tions; for found that now, with those larger magnets, the magne
tism of the solid was to that of the hollow magnet as 1:2:5, and
the magnetism of the solid smaller magnet was to that of the hol
low one in the ratio of 1 : 2-9.     -
   As, after this, more attention will probably be bestowed in future
on the manufacture of hollow permanent magnets for practical use,
I  have resolved to devote to this subject a longer series of experi
ments, and will in due time beg leave to communicate the results,

                               By M. GêRARD-LESCUYER.
   Dynamoelectrical machines, of which the Gramme machine is
the best-known type, are reversible; that is to say, if a current be
passed through them, they give motion, and may serve for the
transmission of force.         Under the same conditions the same pro
perties are possessed by magnetoelectrical machines with continuous
currents.      In this there is nothing new.         But if the current
produced by a dynamoelectrical be sent into a magnetoelectrical
machine, a strange phenomenon is witnessed, which we will
describe.
   As soon as the circuit is closed the magnetoelectrical machine
begins to move; it tends to take a regulated velocity in accordance
 with the intensity of the current by which it is excited ; but sud
denly it slackens             its
                          speed, stops, and starts again     the opposite

receiving machine. We verify this reversal of the polarities of the
inductors by placing near them a simple compass, the needle of
which suddenly turns half round at each change of magnetization
of the inductors.
   Now we ascertain that these movements of the compass-needle
coincide with those of the galvanometer; we may then be sure that
the two phenomena are connected the one with the other, and so
intimately that the one must be the consequence of the other.
   But this explains nothing.    Let us frame an hypothesis, and
suppose for a moment that the receiving magnetoelectrical machine
can, from some cause which we will not investigate, receive periodi
cally an increase of velocity.  Under the conditions of this hypo
thesis our receiving magnetoelectrical machine, instead of continuing
to revolve under the action of the current to which it was at first
submitted, would, in virtue of its increased velocity, give rise to a
current of           its
                own, which                       its
                                  turn would traverse the dynamo
                                            in
electrical machine.    As this current would have the opposite
direction    that proceeding from the generating dynamoelectrical
             it to
machine,     would reverse the polarities     the inductors and giveof
rise   to
        a new current having the same direction       itself, which                 as                     in
 its turn would reverse the direction      rotation      the receiving
                                                               of                      of
machine.
   We have seen above that these effects are shown                  the galva               by

a slight account of the progress of the various arrangements.
    Gas and Water.—It was found that it would be necessary
to have a direct gas-supply, independent of the general supply
of the college. The water-supply was brought in through the
same route.      The gas-main was laid through the concrete of
the floor as far as the meter; and incidentally it was thus
learned how hard that concrete                The gas-main
                                                   is.                 inch       is   1}
in   diameter throughout.         Subsequent experience has shown
that  it  might have been somewhat larger with advantage. The
laying     ofthese pipes occupied nearly two months, and was                                 a
most severe trial        the patience

    Shafting—One of the most unpleasant pieces of work that
had to be done was the fitting of the supports for the shafting
into the walls. The back wall, being brick, was dealt with
without great difficulty; but the front wall is of hard stone,
and cutting the necessary holes right through it was a serious
.
piece of work. What with the laying of the gas- and water
  ipes and this, the laboratory was in the occupation of masons
    pretty nearly the whole of last winter. The shafting is in
two lines, each nearly 30 feet long. The two lines are con
nected by a belt about the middle of each.     The pulleys are
for the most part split pulleys, which can be put on and taken
off without disturbing the shafting. This is an arrangement
of the greatest convenience; indeed, without it no rearrange
ment, such as is often inevitable, would be possible without
serious expense.
  The lathe is by Messrs. Cook, of York.        It has five-foot
bearers, back gear for reduced speeds, a long screw (with
change wheels) for the slide-rest, special apparatus for drill
ing, and cutting the teeth of wheels, and two new arrange
ments of a special character, which were carried out by Messrs.
Cooke according to my directions.
  The Micrometer.—This consists of a worm-wheel of 180
teeth on the pulley of the mandrel, in which a tangent-screw
can be made to engage.     The novelty consists of the details
of the arrangement   by  which the turns of the tangent-screw
can be subdivided. A number of gun-metal disks are pro
vided, which               on

turns; and (2) the effect of the error on a given division is
divided by 180. So that, if a be the maximum error of the
micrometer-wheel,                   is, is     the maximum error                          of   the resulting

invaluable.
    Since June the lathe has been used, chiefly in conjunction
with the engine, in cutting change-wheels for Donkin's har
monograph, the set sold with the machine being quite insuf
ficient for the production of the curves required for discus
sions having some relation to my first results.
   Pneumatic Bellows.-The bellows has been constructed on
a somewhat larger scale than that originally contemplated.
Every increase in the size of bellows is known to conduce to
the steadiness of the wind.       This bellows is about 6 feet long
and 3 feet broad.      It occupies the lower portion of a frame,
the upper part of which carries a wind-chest supplied by wind
trunks of great capacity, and a large and solid table to place
apparatus upon. Thirty slides altogether are provided, with
apertures of various diameters, from nearly two inches to
small fractions of an inch. The bellows itself consists of a
reservoir formed with direct and inverted rib, with connecting
guides, in the ordinary English style. This is supplied by
three feeders, driven by three cranks set at angles of 120° on
|.
a shaft which runs the whole length of the instrument.           The
shaft carries a handle at one end, and a pair of fast and loose
          of large size at the other, by means of which the bel
 ows can be driven from the shafting or disconnected at plea
sure.    The bellows was required to         i.
                                             able to deliver wind at
a pressure of two feet of water.         This is a very unusual test
     organ-bellows;     and it has not proved convenient to
for
sufficient   weight  on so large a bellows; but the bellows has        !"
worked for some time at a pressure of about 1 foot of water,
 which is amply sufficient for any thing likely to be required.
The pressure of ordinary organ-wind is about 2% inches; and it
will probably be convenient to work this bellows at from 3
to 4 inches for most purposes.
    When the bellows is blown by the steam-engine, a lever is
carried from the top of the reservoir to the regulating-handle
of the engine. When things are properly adjusted, a wind of

    Emery Grinder for Tools.-This is an excellent machine of
 American make, small, cheap, and very efficient.   It is screwed
 down upon the filing-bench, where it occupies hardly any
 space, and is driven from the shafting above. The tools ground
by this machine are quite a different thing from tools ground
on the ordinary grindstone, and they take a small fraction of
the usual time to grind.      A few minutes before or after the
regular work of the engine suffice to keep the tools in such
order as could hardly be attained otherwise by an occasional
half day at the grindstone.
   The carpenter's bench is a common one. The filing-bench
is of great solidity,           let
                         into the wall and floor.  supports two           It

 Part II.           On Luminous Phenomena in Gases caused by Elec
    tricity.        By Dr. EUGEN GoLDSTEIN*.

  On a new Phosphorescent Action of the Electric Discharge.
   HE phosphorescence caused by the kathode-rays has been
      hitherto the only example of the excitation of luminosity
on solid surfaces caused by an infinitely thin layer of the dis
charge, and therefore              well-defined images.     The
images are the section of the bundle of electric rays by the
wall of the tube.
    I have succeeded during the last year in discovering two
other modes of exciting such phosphorescence, and of uniting
previous observations into a more extended and consistent
research, whose results are of universal applicability.
   The first of these new methods of producing
occurs equally with pressures at which the kathode-rays excite
                                                                         ºnce

rescence may be              by surrounding one electrode of a
vacuum-tube with a     phosphorescent    powder, which fills the
space between the electrode and the tube and also reaches
beyond the free end of the electrode.           then, while both  If,
electrodes are    connexion with the

                     of the tube follows from the previously-mentioned
  fact, that the surface extends towards the positive side a little

                                                                                                          237
 positive branch. Observations made with a tube to be de
 scribed further on, show that the deviation of the rays from
 the direction of the axis is equal in every direction; whence it
 follows that the rays of the positive
          other,
                                                                       ift
                                                        are not parallel to
 each             but form a conical bundle of small angle whose
 section is circular.
     We therefore regard the phosphorescent surface in the
 bends as the luminous sections of the column of light which
 traverses the negative branch of the bend by the wall of the
 tube ; and we have arrived at the following general view of
the positive light in highly exhausted cylindrical tubes:—
     The positive light in highly rarefied gases consists of rectili
near rays which are propagated from the negative to the positive
side.      The rays form a conical bundle of small angle whose aris
is the aris of the cylindrical portion of the tube; where this
bundle cuts the wall of the tube, the parts of the rays in imme
diate contact with the wall excite phosphorescent light in                                          it.
     The analogy which these properties show exists between the
rays        the positive light and the kathode-rays
             of                                                  obvious.              gois             I

wall of the first bend, and excite a green phosphorescence at
the point b, of the form already described.     Close behind the
bend the positive light shows an obliquely-placed maximum of
light, which is sharply bounded on the negative side and falls
off very rapidly, whilst on the positive side the brightness de
creases very gradually.
   The positive layers traversing the branch 2 reach the
branch 3 at the point y, but do not at once bend round in the
direction of 3, but continue as far as the wall opposite to the
opening y as a well-defined conical bundle of small angle
parallel to the axis of 2; the section of this part of the tube by
the bundle issuing from y appears as a bright sharply-defined
green phosphorescent surface.
   Near the bundle there is in 3 a new maximum of positive
light, separated from it by a feebly-illuminated interval. This
maximum, like the first, is convex towards the negative side,
its brightness falling off rapidly    that side, gradually

     In the Philosophical Magazine for January 1879 Crookes
has  proposed       theory    athe excitation of   phosphorescence              of                              by

    Although the above has long been known to me, yet, in
order to   Ém.      test Crookes's             have
experiments, which      I will briefly describe.
     n a cylinder the kathode was formed by a plane surface
of metal, obliquely to which was placed a phosphorescent
plate, so that at the densities at which the discharge excites
        fº)
phosphorescence a part of this plate lay within and a part
without the second layer of the kathode-light.              But as, ac
cording to Crookes, the second layer (in opposition to the rest
of the                   consists only of molecules not in collision,
and the    phosphorescence     of the wall is caused only by the
impact of such not yet intercepted molecules, the phospho
rescent plate ought to show a sharply-marked contour-line
where the plate is intersected by the outer surface of the
#.
second layer, on one side of which it should be brightly
   hosphorescent,    and on the other dull or altogether non
                  servation shows, however, that no such dividing
line  exists; the brightness of the phosphorescent plate alters
continuously from point to point, and is still of considerable
intensity in the neighbourhood of the outer kathode-light,
which, according to Crookes, consists almost entirely of
colliding particles incapable of exciting phosphorescence.
    Mr. Crookes must have observed that in particular cases
surfaces lying outside of the second layer still phosphoresce.
To explain this he assumes that a few molecules have much
overpassed the mean free path of the molecules thrown off
from the negative pole,     ..so    reach and excite phosphorescent
screens lying outside the second layer.
    The mean free path of the molecules thrown off from the
                                   .
 negative pole agrees, according to Crookes, with that calcu
 lated from the kinetic theory         gases for the mean free path
 in the gas contained in the discharge-tube.             I had a cylin
 drical tube constructed, 90 centims. long, in which the kathode

242              Dr. E. Goldstein     on the Electric
reference    to the wall of the tube chosen       by Crookes, under
certain circumstances        the   phosphorescent    surface of the
kathode-light was reduced to a point; but without alteration
of the position of the mirror it was possible, either by alteration
of the density of the gas or by interpolation of sparks in the
discharge, to obtain surfaces of considerable and very various
diameters as foci of the mirror, instead of a point.        I venture,
for the sake of   clearness,  to give a few data of the  experiments.
    The distance of the centre of aperture of the mirror from
the wall was 15 millims. ; a small Ruhmkorff's coil which
        sparks about 14 centim. long in air was discharged
#.  rough a cylindrical tube of 4 centims, width, whose axis
was cut at right angles by the axis of the mirror.          At a pres
sure of about       , centim. there     appeared  as focus a bright
round    phosphorescent     disk of 4 millims. diameter.      If there
were now interposed in the external circuit an air-spark of
varying length, the diameter of the phosphorescent                disk
increased as the interpolated air-spark increased in length.
The diameter of the surface (measured by means of a divided
 strip of paper laid on the outside of the tube) increased thus
 up to 1 centim. At 13 millim. pressure the diameter with
 out the spark was 2% millims., and when the spark was inter
polated rose to 8 millims.          At ºr millim. the smallest dia
 meter of the image was 1% millim.
     When, instead of the small Ruhmkorff apparatus, a larger
 inductorium, giving much longer sparks, was employed, the
 diameter of the surface varied even when the position of the
 mirror and the density of the gas remained unaltered, even
 with the same length of interposed air-space.         (It is probable
 that this variation is connected with the fact that sparks of
 different length may leap across an air-space of constant
 length, in consequence of the curvature of the sparks, the more
 strongly-curved sparks representing greater tensions.)
     Thus with constant air-space        .#   constant pressure the
 diameter of the luminous surface varied rapidly from
 2 millims. to more than 1 centim.
     In another case the centre of the mirror was at a distance
 (25 millims.) from the wall equal to twice the radius of cur
 vature of the mirror.      According to the law of divergence of
 the rays supposed by Crookes, the phosphorescent surface
 ought to have had a diameter equal to that of the mirror
  (21% millims.), and ought to have remained constant.
     At a pressure of 4 millim. the kathode-light produced no
 phosphorescence, when the exterior circuit was altogether
 metallic ; but when sparks were interposed, phosphorescent
  surfaces up to 26 millims, diameter were obtained.

 as is well-known, the diminution of the density causes an
 increase in the brilliancy of the phosphorescence.     But an
 appearance which is decisive on this point, results from a
 slight imperfection in the mirror employed; the mirror, struck
 with       a die andsubsequently polished, was not perfectly
 smooth near the  edge (in consequence of imperfect malleability
 of the iron out of which it was made), but showed there short
 slight wrinkles. In consequence of this, the phosphorescent
 disk does not appear bounded by a smooth curve, but the
 periphery of the image shows small teeth and protuberances.

      are placed beside each other in a vacuum-tube, each of them
      shuts off certain rays from the other from a particular portion
      of the glass wall". There result therefore, at suitable densities,
      two phosphorescent surfaces which appear dark in comparison
      with the surrounding parts of the glass wall, inasmuch as the
      one receives no rays from a and the other no rays from b,
      whilst the surrounding portion of the glass receives rays from
      both.

                  now, the rays      the kathode  of   for example, were     a,
      not permanently   cut off, but  alternately  cut off and allowed

Substituting the values from above, we find

Thus in this case the plane of polarization of the emergent
light is inclined to a plane fixed in the Nicol at an angle of 5°3'.
   Let Oa, Oy, Oz be the three rectangular axes taken above,
viz. the normal to the face of incidence drawn inwards, and
two lines parallel to AC and BD respectively.
  Let O N in the plane a Oy be inclined at 20° to Oa.                                               ON
is approximately parallel to an edge of the rhomb, and is the
axis round which the rhomb is turned.
   Let ON' in the plane NO Z be inclined at 5° to ON. ON'
is the direction of the incident or emergent-wave normal
in the case considered above; and the plane of polarization
of the emergent wave is inclined at an angle of 5° 3' to the
plane a Oy.
   Now          let     us
              suppose the Nicol rotated through      angle                               an              of
90° about ON.        Oa', Oy', Oz’}. the new positions    thebe                                    of
axes; then ON’ lies    the plane y'Oa'. in
                 N'Or'-25°,                  N'Oy=65°,            NO2 =90°.
Thus,   if      l',   m',    n'   are the new direction-cosines                    of   ON',
                      l'= cos 25°,               m/-   cos 65°,        =0.
                                                                      n'
And       this case the intersection of the incident wave and the
        of in            possible direction                       of

with w'Oy'.   But previously the plane of polarization of the
emergent wave was inclined at 5°3' to coy.
   Thus by this rotation the Nicol and the plane roy have been
turned through 90°, while the plane of polarization of the
emergent light has been rotated through 90°,+5°3'. Thus,
if the incident light were inclined in this manner to the axis
of the Nicol at 5°, we might introduce an error of 5°3' into
the measurement of a rotation of about 90°. The sign of the
error will depend on the direction in which the Nicol is turned.
     Ihave assumed that the axis of rotation of the Nicol is
 arallel to one edge of the rhomb of which it is composed.
º   the two are inclined at a small angle, the numbers will be
modified slightly, but remain much of the same magnitude.
   It seemed hopeless, from the number and complication of
the formulae, to try and solve the problem generally;             was          I
therefore obliged to give numerical values to the quantities
involved.       I
                have supposed, too, that the Nicol has been cut
directly from a rhomb of spar; so that the face of incidence is
a cleavage-plane.
   Let us now consider briefly the case in which the ends of
the Nicol are perpendicular to            its
                                         length, and therefore     the         to

this plane and the face    of  incidence will     greater be        by

closed, the thing is simplified in this way—that, besides the
intensity of the current, we have only to consider the position
and direction of the current-elements, without taking sepa
rately into consideration the two electricities present in them.
Thereby we then arrive at formulae of extraordinary simplicity,
which afford great facilities for the determination of the pon
                                                                                           .

 the entire field of mathematical developments having reference
thereto.
  These formulae         I
                     will take leave to develop in the sequel—
and not  merely  from the electrodynamic fundamental law ad
vanced   by me,  but also from those of Riemann and Weber.
It will be seen that the results of this formulation correspond
ing to the three laws differ from each other only by
easily determinable terms, and hence can very conveniently
be compared with one another.

two changes undergone by r, on the one hand through the
motion of the unit of electricity, and on the other through the
motion of the element ds' of the conductor containing the
particle of electricity;           while
                                             §   refers to the change produced
in r by the current-motion of the electricity-particle which
takes place in the conductor.
   Employing this method of notation, the a components of
the force which a current-element ds' exerts upon the moved
unit of electricity may now be determined, first, according to
the fundamental electrodynamic law advanced by me, because
it is the most convenient for the working and furnishes the
simplest expressions, to which, in order to obtain the expres
sions corresponding to the two other fundamental laws, certain
terms must then be added.

force which one moved particle e of electricity undergoes from
another,        e, is   represented      by the formula

    According to my fundamental law the electrodynamic po

 concentrated in points, is represented by

   If in employing this formula we put for e the unit of elec
tricity, and for e successively the two quantities h’ds' and
 —h'ds' of electricity contained in a current-element ds', and
in regard to the velocity-components of the latter take into
account that they flow in the conductor in opposite directions
with the velocities c' and c'i, while they have in common any
motion of the conductor, and if we then form the sum of these
two expressions, putting h'(c/+c/1) =       and, lastly, integrate          f',
this sum over the closed  current,  we  get

  Now, in order to deduce from the preceding formulae the
ponderomotive force exerted upon a current-element by a closed
current, we first form from the potential function the poten
tials of the closed current upon the two electricities flowing in
the current-element.      From these we get, by the above-stated
operation, the components, in any one direction             the                           (e.   g.         c
direction),     the forces which the two electricities undergo;
                   of
and the sum             of
                  these two components      the respective force     is
component which refers      the entire current-element.

  We now turn to the determination of the electromotive force
which is induced in an element of the conductor by a closed
current or system of currents.
  For it we have only to determine the component of the force
force also, the consideration of the subject could have been simplified.
That is to say, we obtain for the ponderomotive force, even with single
current-elements acting upon one another, expressions which contain not
the velocities of the positive and the negative electricity as quantities to
be separately dealt with, but, only the current-intensity       on the whole.

    XXXVI.        The Cause of the Production of Electricity by the
 Contact    of   Heterogeneous Metals.  By Prof. FRANZ ExNER".
 Tiºgi             it has so often been experimentally proved that
        a difference of electric potential is produced by the contact
 of heterogeneous metals, there has not as yet been given any
explanation of this phenomenon that will bear serutiny:-
 contact theory as well as the so-called chemical theory both
lay claim to this phenomenon, and the adherents of the two
theories are at the present day perhaps about equal.     An                                           in
yestigation concerning the nature of galvanic polarization
has led me to a quite distinct view of the origin of the so
called contact electricity, a view which will be verified by
the following experiments.     In the above-mentioned inves
tigation    I
            have shown that the original cause of the polari
zation-current is not to be looked for, as has heretofore been
 generally assumed, at the contact of the electrodes with the
 ions separated on them, but in the recombination of these
 latter; and the electromotive force of the current so produced
 is measured by the heat-value of this combination, just as
 the electromotive force of any galvanic cell is measured by
 the heat-value of the chemical process going on in                   With                 it.
a   so-called contact action the existence             the polarization    of
 current, and obviously         every other current, has nothing
                                            of
 whatever       to
               do.
    When, therefore, the contact theory proved                   here per        to   be
 fectly inapplicable, and indeed superfluous, the idea                once                    at
 suggested itself,     undertake from this
                              to                standpoint       criticism                a

to   seek for the cause       the production

for the greatest exactitude and correctness; therefore in all
the following calculations his figures only are taken.
   Far less agreement exists between the works of various
authors with regard to the electromotive force at contact
of two metals; here, no doubt, the great difficulty of
the experiments causes considerable differences.         Never
theless it follows, from the evidence of    known experiments,            all
that the tension series      identical with the series of oxida

opposite, and measured, with a Delmann's electrometer, the
electric charge in both cases.         If
                                    the difference of potential
of the two condenser-plates be  P, and that of the poles of the

can be found. A direct connexion of the plates by a wire
gives a check experiment.
   In this way Kohlrausch finds the difference Zn/Pt="6
Daniell, and the ratio
                          %.      varying between                and
                                                                        lº.
We shall have an opportunity further on of returning to
the probable cause of this variability.
  Quite recently a number of other experiments bearing on
this subject have been made, as, for example, by Clifton *, who
likewise employed the condenser method.       He finds :—
                         Zn/Fe=-694 Daniell,
                         Fe Cu-095                ,
and from these           ZnCu-'789                ,
by application of Volta's law of tensions, the truth of which
will not be questioned.
  The results of Kohlrausch appear to me, however, to possess
greater accuracy.      He finds, according to the above figures,
Zn Cu about 5 Daniell.        Ayrton and Perry f have obtained
results generally analogous to those of Clifton.
   Furthermore must be mentioned an old experiment by Sir
W. Thomson f, giving an account of the absolute value of
Zn] Cu.    In his well-known ring electrometer the two half
rings were made of Zn and Cu.        Over the slit swung a needle
charged as might be desired.      When the two half-rings were
metallically connected the needle deflected to one side or the
other; but if they were joined each to one pole of a Daniell
cell in the proper manner, the force of the latter overpowered
the contact force of the two metals, and it was possible, by a
proper division of the electromotive force of the Daniell, to
arrange so that the needle remained undeflected.       Zn/Cu was
consequently less than one Daniell, which agrees with        other    all
experiments.
   Thomson observed further, that when the copper half-rin
was oxidized   in   the lamp-flame,         its
                                         electromotive force                .#
zinc rose considerably, and appeared            even greater than
                                                  to    be
that of1   Daniell.

ruling theories of Volta's experiments. Still they give but a
partial test for the same. It is known that Volta himself
assumed the existence of a heterogeneous action of the touching
metals on the electricity contained in them, in consequence
of which a redivision of it resulted.   This view, so far as I
know, was first by Helmholtz brought into a determinate
form, in which it is now generally accepted.
   Helmholtz " says:—“All phenomena in conductors of the
first class may be referred to the assumption that the different
chemical substances have different affinities for the two
electricities . . . . . . The contact force would therefore con
sist of the difference of the attraction forces which the mole
cules     lying near the surface of contact exercise on the                                           elec
tricities at that place.”
    Against this position a protest, as is known, has been raised
by Clausius f, at least so far as concerns the statement that
“all phenomena in conductors of the first class” may be
deduced from the contact force, referring principally to the
phenomena of thermo-electricity.
    After all, however, this hypothesis is at present commonly
accepted; and it cannot be denied that through this concise
theory any investigation in this field has rendered good service.
It is another question whether, in the present state of things,
we are compelled to hold with                       it,
                                           there may not  orfound

                                          a               of
phenomena.
  And such               is,
                     appears   asme, the view advanced by the
                                              to

evolve  electricity only when  they  are undergoing     the same                            at

only by the condensed water-vapour, as is now generally
supposed, but also in dry air directly by the oxygen, and,
moreover, that electricity is produced by any kind of chemical
action, in proportion to the intensity of the chemical affinity.
I  take it for granted that the nature and method of his
deduction of the voltaic phenomenon from this hypothesis is
well known.
   If there had existed at that time exact quantitative measure
                                                       º
ments of the electromotive forces at contact, and also a
measure for the intensity of chemical affinity such as we now
have in the heats of combustion, the truth of this view, which
is supported also by other writers *, would have been at once
apparent.
    Since such direct proof was not forthcoming, the opponents
held fast the old Voltaic hypothesis with an unvarying bitter
ness, more especially Pfafff, who sought, by                      to
reduce the chemical theory to an absurdity.             He arranged,
inter alia, the fundamental experiment in vacuo instead of in
air, also in indifferent gases such as hydrogen, but found
always the same production of electricity, where none should
have been expected.        De la Rive has, however, proved the
cause of this to be in the difficulty of removing a gas-film
from the surface of a metal even in vacuo, and shown f, at the
same time, that the experiment, when quite fairly carried out,
was in favour of the chemical theory.
   Nevertheless the chemical theory has in course of time
been more and more supplanted by the contact theory, since
an exact proof could not be found for either one or other; and
so the above-mentioned proposition of Helmholtz (originally
expressed as a well considered hypothesis, and as such not to
be undervalued) came gradually to be regarded as the expres
sion of a fact.
                                                 I
    Such was the position of matters when was driven by my
experiments on galvanic polarization to the conclusion that
the so-called contact electricity had likewise a chemical origin.
One can undertake the proof of this view in different ways:–
first, by showing that two heterogeneous metals give no
evolution of electricity when in a chemically indifferent
environment. This proof has already been given by De la
Rive in very careful experiments; and          I   consider it super
fluous to repeat an experiment for which De la Rive is re
 sponsible.    Secondly, it can be shown that the differences of
potential assumed by any two metals in air have a direct
connexion with the heats of combustion of the metals; and,

thirdly, it can be shown that two pieces of one and the same
metal evolve electricity inmediately they are placed each in
 a differently acting atmosphere.
    The second and third methods are followed in the following
 pages; and I shall now describe the experiments which show
 that the difference of potential between two metals in air is
 really measured by their heats of combustion.
    In the first place it will be well to obtain a distinct con
 ception with reference to the mode of dependence of the
 tension on the heat of combustion. Though the whole process
 of the production of electricity             accordingis,     the present          to
 state   of
          things,           by

metal in connexion with the zinc is also oxidizable in air, still
the theory evidently remains the same ; the difference of
potential of two metals is always measured by half the dif
ference of their heats of combustion.
    Thus, in order to prove the truth of the chemical theory, one
has only to compare the observed differences of potential with
the heats of combustion so exactly determined by            Thomsen.            J.
    Such a comparison shows at once a general correspondence
between experiment and calculation, as also concerning the
absolute value of the differences of potential. The figures,
however, that have been given by different authors for the
 tension-differences     (on account of reasons which we shall
presently have opportunity to examine) agree only in a
moderate degree.         I have therefore endeavoured to obtain
with      all
            possible exactitude the difference         potential for  of                       at
least a   few metals.      For this purpose       adopted exclusively

have the metals         different gases.
    A  condenser was accordingly formed from the metal                                    to   be

the condenser was         paraffin; and metal handles were fastened
                            of

                                    must, however, here remark
that this equality  did not continue long. Even after two or
three days the gold plate gave considerably smaller values
than the platinum ; and it is not long till such a gilt brass
plate behaves almost the same as one without gilding. This
can only be due to the fact that the air gradually permeates
the gold, and oxidizes the brass underneath.
   A similar observation has been made by De La Rive with
varnished plates, so long as the varnish layer has not a very
considerable thickness.                      #.
                                behaviour of a thin metallic cover
ing is of interest, because the most apparently trustworthy of
the old experiments were made with such gilt and platinized
plates, for example those of Kohlrausch.

   This author arranged special experiments * to try if a
platinized brass plate behaved the same as a thick platinum
one, and found         it did                      so.
                                    Still this experiment was                                       in

as the interior of the glass tube was filled with dry chlo
rine gas, evolved from potassium bichromate and hydrochloric
acid, the condenser showed at once a considerable and quite
constant tension. At the same time the inner side of the
lower silver plate blackened.          The difference of potential
lasted, however, only so long as the combination of the chlo
rine with the silver went on.       If the chlorine was driven out
of the vessel   by dry   air, and time allowed for the silver to
completely consume the remaining traces of chlorine clingin

silver is 92,400 calories. Therefore the calculation for the
difference of potential between silver in air and silver in chlo
rine gives the value 543 Daniell. This extraordinary agree
ment, considering the small number of experiments, can pro
bably only be ascribed to chance.        Finally, the movable
                                                                              .
silver plate was exposed to the action of chlorine till perfectly
black, and again examined.     There resulted the value '54, as
before; but this value decreased very rapidly when the plate
continued exposed to the air; and experiments immediatel
following one another gave the values 46, 42, -38, :36;
after standing twelve hours, no difference of potential was
observable, although the one plate was bright and the other
perfectly blackened by chlorine.
   I believe the results of the foregoing experiments bear elo
quent testimony in favour of the chemical theory. It is not
only that the qualitative relations correspond, without excep
tion, to this hypothesis, but the quantitative determinations
agree so well with the calculated values that the truth of the
theory under consideration hardly admits of any further doubt.
The only substance with which        I
                                     have not succeeded in ob
taining any positive result was lead.         Not that it failed,
when in contact with    platinum,   to give  values which agreed
with  calculation, but it was impossible   to obtain two observa
tions that would agree together. The reason of this was ap
parently the great rapidity with which a bright lead surface
is attacked by the air, and, secondly, the impossibility of
giving it a good polish; this latter, however, is imperatively
necessary when working with a solid insulating layer in the
condenser, in order that the distance between   -  the plates may
be the same at each measurement.
   In   reference to the value of the last experiments with silver
in chlorine,   I may make the following remarks:—If one could
prove, with regard to     all
                           substances, that their differences                      of
potential are proportionate                         their respec

     If two bright copper plates be in contact in air, they show
no difference of potential,—according to the contact theory,
because they are the same substance; according to the che
mical theory, because the action of the air is equal on both.
If now this action be removed from one plate, e.g. by oxida
tion in a flame, it is well known that a great difference of
  otential is obtained—which, according to the chemical theory,
is because only one of the plates now continues to oxidize in
the air and the other not ; according to the contact theory,
because now two substances are brought in contact, viz.
copper and copper oxide. Which of the two explanations is
correct is decided by the above experiment with silver in
chlorine. In the case where one of the silver plates is in air
 and the other in chlorine, there is a certain difference of po
tential so long as the action of the chlorine continues. As
soon, however, as both plates are surrounded by air, the dif
ference of potential disappears altogether, since now the
action on both plates is again the same. This experiment
 with silver and chlorine succeeds well, because the silver takes
 but a short time to consume the film of chlorine clinging
 to it.
    According to the chemical theory, the explanation of this
 experiment is perfectly clear; but according to the contact
 theory, not       so.
                     According      the latter, the difference
                                           to                                                       of
 potential should continue, since one plate         silver and the     is

                                 can at present see, the theory
of the cell may be represented in a considerably simpler

    Those who are familiar with the methods of blowpipe analysis
 have observed faint borders occasionally surrounding some of the
 coloured charcoal coatings, the colours of these borders seemingly
 bearing no relation to the characteristic colours of
                                                          the adjoining
 oxides. For instance, the white coating of antimony is generally
accompanied with a blue border, the brownish oxide of cadmium
occasionally with a green, while the lead and bismuth yellows
                                                                       not

they may be produced at pleasure from the purest specimens, they
cannot be due to mixtures of the metals.       A possible analogy with
the antimony blue was suggested by a consideration of the colours
of the sky; and to prove the connection, it was simply necessary
to show the similarity of attendant phenomena. As is well known,
it is believed that the blue of the sky is due to the presence in
the atmosphere of suspended particles so fine that they are unable
to reflect the longer rays of the spectrum, which accordingly are
transmitted, and the union of the remainder gives to the sky
blueness. At evening the sky           red because we get the rays

completely vanished, while the white presented the usual ghastly
appearance.       A blue book-cover, treated in the same manner, gave
more reflection than did the blue coating.
    Experiments with the polariscope were at first inconclusive, from
the fact that though the light from the blue coating was largely
    larized, so, to some extent, was also that irregularly reflected
  rom the charcoal, and it was found necessary to cover the block with
a thin layer of carbon from a gas-flame.                The repetition of the test
then showed that the           proportion     of  light   polarized by the layer
of   carbon,   at the    given    angle,   was almost nothing; that by the
 thick white      coating,    small,    while on the blue the phenomenon
 was almost complete.            What light here was not polarized was
 evidently reflected from the larger particles mixed with the fine;

polarized, and the rays which pass through form                    deep, dark red.            a

In  exceptional cases it is possible to produce such a thin coating
that the extreme edge is fringed with a faint blue.
   The other case, lead, is now easily explained. This metal gives
a coating   of which the colour is a beautiful chrome yellow ; and
regarding this merely as a repetition of the preceding phenomenon,
and the yellow as compounded of rays from the whole range of the
spectrum but not in the proper proportion to form white, the line of
thought suggested evidently is that, if the layer be decreased in
thickness regularly from the centre to the circumference of the
charcoal, there ought to be, at some distance from the centre, a
zone within which sufficient red should be transmitted to equalize
the amount of blue lost by absorption, and the reflected rays should
form a yellowish white. Beyond this, as the thickness of layer
still decreased, the colour should be blue for the same reason as in
the case of antimony.     The white zone is easily produced; and the
blue border which always surrounds it polarizes the light as
before and transmits orange-coloured rays.
   The theory, once given, serves to explain nearly           the anoma                  all
lous colourings      the charcoal coatings, the bluish borders which

XXXVIII.      On the new Action of Magnetism on a permanent
   Electric Current.  By E. H. HALL, Assistant in Physics at
   the Johns  Hopkins University".
IN      the early part of last winter, there was published
      the “American Journal of Mathematics’f an account
                                                                                    in
                                                                                    of
some experiments which prove that an electric current, as                           di
stinguished from the conductor bearing the current, is acted
upon by magnetic force in a manner altogether different from
that in which ordinary induction is known to take place.     The
new  phenomenon   was, in short, the action of a permanent mag
netic force on a permanent electric current.      Up to the time
when the above-mentioned article was written, this new action
had been observed only in one conducting material—gold.
In the present article will be given the results of observations
with several other conductors; but first it seems worth while
to give some account of various closely related experiments
which, though resulting negatively, are not entirely devoid of
interest.
                                                                       ...i.
   In the previous article the fact was mentioned that a form
of apparatus had been devised which, it was thought, might
reveal the new action in the shape of an increase
in the conductor. The plan, as modified in accordance with a

 tive force of a Bunsen cell, or 340 millims. on reversing the
 connexions with such a cell. The battery of Leyden jars was
 charged to a potential sufficient to give a spark of 2 or 3
millims.     The connexions being thus made, the position of the
spot of light was observed and the magnet then operated with
the purpose of discovering, if possible, any consequent change
of position of the spot of light which would indicate an action
of the magnet on the lines of static induction in the glass.
The observation failed to establish the existence of any such
                      i.
action. The electrometer being in a very sensitive condition,
the spot of light was rather unsteady ; so that any very slight
effect of the          looked for would not have been detected,
though it is probable that, if a reversal of the magnet had
caused a change of four millims. in the position of the spot of
light, this effect would have been apparent.
    We may therefore conclude that any change of relative po
tential on the quadrants of the electrometer caused by reversal
of the magnet was probably less than                      that caused by

 that, so far as observation has gone, the relative direction of
 the transverse current is always the same for                particular
 metal. This       uniformity   in so   many    cases could   hardly  be
 accidental.
     This matter of direction is evidently one of fundamental im
 portance. The direction was found to be the same for silver
 as for gold, these being the two metals first examined.            Pro
 fessor   Rowland,    however,   predicted   that the direction would
 be reversed in iron ; and experiment verified prediction.          Pro
  fessor Rowland's comments upon the significance of this dis
 covery are already before the public". It is a seemingly
 awkward fact that in nickel, next to iron and cobalt the most
 strongly magnetic substance, the direction of the transverse
 current is the same as in gold. This fact will be discussed
 further on. The conductors which have up to this date been
 subjected to experiment are gold, silver, iron, tin, nickel, and
 platinum. The direction is the same in              except iron.   all

 In order      to reduce those results to the form since adopted, it
would be      necessary   to know the thickness of the gold strip.
This thickness      might   be determined      roughly if we knew the
specific resistance of the material and the actual resistance of
the strip, which is now destroyed. The latter value is known
approximately; and by assuming the specific resistance to have
been that of pure gold, we might arrive at a value of the ratio
MxV
   E'    '    This value, however, would be very much larger than
that obtained when thicker strips of metal are used; and facts
to be hereafter mentioned make it appear quite probable that
the thickness of the strip, as above arrived at, is several times
smaller than the true thickness".
    Without attempting, therefore, any accurate determination
                                               I
of the constant of this first strip (A), pass on to

    This plate also is of very thin metal; and in general shall
use the term gold leaf when speaking of the                  in this shape,
and use the term gold foil to denote the strips of considerable
thickness.
    This second plate of gold leaf was not constructed until after
several thick plates had been tried and found to give very dif
 ferent results from those obtained with the first thin plate in
 the manner described above. Thinking that some experimental
 error in the first measurements might account for the discre
 pancy, and the first plate being destroyed, I constructed the
 second one. In making observations with this plate             I first used
 the high-resistance Thomson galvanometer, whereas the low
 resistance instrument had been used with the thick plates.
 Thinking that I might in changing instruments have fallen
                      I
 into some error, afterwards made another series of observa
 tions with the same plate, but using the low-resistance galva
 nometer. The results were (the thickness here also being
estimated as above described):—

thicker plates. Arguing from these facts alone, it would appear
that the transverse effect in thin leaf gold is relatively much
smaller than the effect in strips of sensible thickness; but this
is hardly a safe conclusion. Three objections to the above
method of determining the thickness by means of the resist

  This strip was, I believe, of the kind called by dentists
“hard,” or “cohesive.”    To determine the thickness it was
weighed before being attached to the glass.   Previous expe
 riments having shown the great variation in thickness between
 different parts of a sheet of gold foil, this strip was cut before
 weighing into nearly the same shape and size that it was to
 have on the glass.
    The strip was in general shape a parallelogram with a pro
jection from the middle of each of         longer sides. The use   its
of   these projections, which were much reduced         size before                    in
 making the observations, has been already explained.

twice on March 5th, once before and once after the other ob
servations. The two values varied by something more than
1 per cent.    The mean of the two is taken as the uniform
strength for the day. The strength of the primary current
sent through the gold strip was much varied for the different

    Measurements had now been made with three plates of gold
foil; and, considering the irregularity likely to be produced by
the impossibility of determining accurately the effective thick
ness of the
              fºv,       the results seemed to agree satisfactorily,
indicating
             Mºv to be a constant             for this metal.         If the  expe
riments in gold had begun with these particular plates, they
would probably have ended with them for the present. Owing,
however, to the great discrepancy observed between these
results and those obtained with the very thin plates, it seemed
desirable to go further ; and I therefore constructed a plate,

    The agreement of this result with the mean of those just
preceding is entirely satisfactory, and the discrepancy above
mentioned as existing between the results with plates of dif
ferent kinds is confirmed. This disagreement was so large as
to be difficult to account for, without the hypothesis of a spe
cific difference exhibited by different forms of the same metal,
under the conditions of the experiment. To be sure, the me
thod of estimating the thickness from the electrical resistance
was open to suspicion. Among other probable sources of error,
there was the possibility of having assumed a wrong value for
the specific resistance of the silver in this condition.           It did
not appear to me probable that an error of about 400 per cent.
could be accounted for in this way; but it seemed worth while
to attempt a determination of the thickness of the films by
another method.
    Plate A was taken and cleaned with alcohol to remove the
                          ...,
particles of cement adhering to the glass and metal.            The area
of the silver film was roughly determined; and the plate was

again dried and weighed. In addition to this the solution of
silver was filtered and treated with hydrochloric acid. The
precipitate was filtered off, and the silver reduced by burning
with the filter-paper. The amount of silver on the glass was
thus estimated in two ways.       According to the weight lost
by the plate the amount of silver appeared to be 4.3 mgrs.;
while the amount obtained by the chemical process was only
about 2.5 mgrs. There are good reasons for thinking the
former-value too great, and some reasons for thinking the
latter too small. Giving the latter double weight in taking
                               4-3-1-2   x 2.5
the mean, we get                     3           =3:1 mgrs. for the amount                   of
silver in the film. The area covered by this on the glass was
about 20 square centims.     Taking the specific gravity of silver
to be  10-5, we  get for the thickness of the film,
                                    •0031

   This value is more than 3-6 times as large as that obtained
by the resistance method.   In order to make perfect accord
between the results obtained with the two kinds of silver
plates, the thickness would need to be rather more than four
times as great as that obtained by the resistance method; but,

give numerical results for this metal. The main object in
using it was to determine the direction of the new effect
therein, nickel being, next to iron and cobalt, the most strongly
magnetic substance.     As already stated, this direction was
                ...
found to be opposite to that in iron. The action in nickel,
though not          measured, was seen to be very decided, and
may possibly prove to be as strong as that in iron.
                                                  TIN.
   The action in this metal is very small, and has not been
measured with any accuracy.         Its magnitude may be one
thirtieth of that of the action in gold.
   No other conductors have been tested in such a manner as
to warrant an expectation of detecting an action.
   In the following table the results obtained with the different
metals are brought together.    Those obtained with very thin
strips will be marked thus (?), for reasons which must be evi

 the action we have been considering, placing at our command,
 as it does, a new point of view from which to study the inte
 j
 rior workings of the substances examined, is destined to teach
 us a good deal in regard to the molecular structure of bodies,
 while helping us toward an understanding of the physical
 nature of electricity and magnetism.
    We return now to the remarkable anomaly presented by
 the direction of the action in iron. That the direction in this
 metal, a magnetic substance, should be different from that in
 gold, a diamagnetic substance, is remarkable, but not perhaps
 surprising.   We find, however, that nickel and platinum,
 both magnetic substances, resemble in the particular above
 mentioned, not iron, but gold and the other diamagnetic sub
stances.    This fact has to be taken into account in endeavour
ing to apply the newly discovered action to explain the mag
netic rotation of the plane of polarization in accordance wi
the principles of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light.
             Rowland, therefore, in view of this difference of
behaviour of iron and nickel with respect to electricity, was
 very desirous to know whether these two metals would mani
fest a similar disagreement in their action upon light.      I have
therefore, at his suggestion, repeated Kerr's experiment on the
rotation of the plane of polarization of light by reflection from
the pole of a magnet, using nickel for the latter instead of
iron. The reflecting surface used was the nickel plating on
one of the disks of Professor Rowland’s absolute electrometer.
This disk, for the purpose of the experiment, was placed
between the poles of the electromagnet.       The action upon the
plane of polarization, though apparently much weaker than in
iron, has, in the plate used, unmistakably the same direction.
This nickel plating, however, was executed in Germany; and
Professor Rowland thinks that, as the nickel of that country is
very impure, this specimen may possibly contain iron enough
to mask the true action of the nickel.
   I have already spoken of the fact that, when a strongly mag
netic substance is experimented upon, complications are         in
troduced by the influence of the induced magnetism, which
affects the condition of the magnetic field through which the
current flows, making the value of M different from that de
termined by means of the test-coil. It does not seem probable
that in this fact can be found an explanation of the anomalous
behaviour of iron; but there is no doubt that an interesting
research is here suggested.    For instance, it might be profitable
to subject to experiment a thin plate of hard steel, and deter
mine to what extent the permanent magnetization induced
therein by the electromagnet would be accompanied by a per

manent change in the equipotential lines after the electromag
net had ceased to act.
   It is perhaps idle to speculate as to the exact manner in
which the action between the magnet and the current takes
place in any of the preceding experiments; but it may be
worth while to remark a seeming analogy, somewhat strained
perhaps, between this action and a familiar mechanical phe
nomenon, the theory of which has of late attracted consider
able attention.     It is well known that a base-ball projected
swiftly through the air, and having at the same time a rapid
motion of rotation about                    its
                                 vertical axis, does not throughout
its course continue       the original
                              in         vertical plane         motion,                        of   its
but follows path curving sensibly
                a                            one side.    Imagine now
                                                                    to

             Magnetism         on a permanent              Electric Current.                        327
in opposite directions through the coils of a differential galva
nometer,  were so adjusted that their combined action produced
no effect upon the needle.   A third spiral, similar to the others
and itself  bearing a current,  was now brought near one of
these, and the galvanometer was observed.      No permanent de
flection of the needle was detected ; and therefore no perma
nent action of one current on the other was discovered.    have                                 I
not had access to the original article, and cannot say what the
author's theory of the experiment may have been. The method
of attacking the problem seems, however, to have been similar
in principle to that which                 I
                               at first adopted, viz. an endea
vour to increase the resistance experienced by an electrical
current by diverting it from                        its
                                     normal course through the
conductor.

   On the same page of the Galvanismus which treats of the
research of Mach, as mentioned above, Wiedemann describes,
as a means of showing that no action takes place between per
manent electric currents as such, almost the exact arrange
ment of apparatus with which the discovery was finally made.
Who first used this apparatus for this purpose    cannot say,  I
unless it may have been Wiedemann himself. The same plan
was hit upon by Professor Rowland" (quite independently,                       I
believe); and he experimented to some extent in this direction
about the year 1876.     The same arrangement was finally
adopted by me after another method of attacking the problem
had been unsuccessfully tried.

XXXIX.       On Magneto-Electric Induction.—Part II. Conduc
   tivity of Liquids. By FREDERICK GUTHRIE and C. W. Boys,
   Assoc. R. Sch. Minest.
                             [Plate       VIII.]
     a previous communication f we showed experimentally
 IN that, other things being equal, conductor in a moving
                                                    a
 magnetic field is urged to move by a force which varies as
 the product of the conductivity into the relative speed ; so
that by observing the torsion of a wire supporting successively
a variety of conductors of the same form and size in a re
volving magnetic field, a measure of their relative conduc
tivity may be obtained. In the case of most metals, this
method of determining conductivity cannot be compared, at
least for convenience, with the usual one with the bridge,
galvanometer, &c.; but with less-perfect conductors, with
such as cannot be drawn into wire, and especially with electro
lytes, our method seemed very promising ; for, whatever be
the actual course of the electrical currents induced in the
liquid, they are closed, no electrodes are present, there is no
electrolysis, and there is no polarization.
                     ii
   The preliminary experiments, performed with the apparatus
described in our       paper, clearly showed that with suitable
means a measurable and even a large effect might be produced.

 emery, and a strip of strong brown paper attached to it with
 paste. Two vertical strips of ebonite are fastened to the
 paper ring with shellac, and bound round with cotton, and the
 whole well varnished with shellac varnish. These strips are
 fastened by ivory pins to the boxwood beam B; and to the
 centre of this beam the torsion wire w is made fast by being
 wound three times round the little reel r and the end secured
 by a needle-point. The torsion wire passes over a zinc wheel
 about 13 feet above the beam B, and down again to the same
 level, where it passes round the zinc screw 2; so that by
 turning this screw the vessel A can always be brought to the
 same level, whatever be the specific gravity of the liquid

variations in the increase are due to changes in the magnets,
or the wire, or both, the effect of which may therefore be
allowed for accurately.       It is true that possible changes in
the distribution of the magnetism cannot be taken into ac
count; so that, if the upper magnets changed more or less than
the lower ones, the comparison plate would indicate too great
or too small a change; but no error of any importance is
likely to result from such a cause. Also changes in the con
ductivity of the brass due to temperature have not been con
sidered, though they can be at any time. After the observed
conductivity of a liquid has been corrected by means of this
comparison plate, it is independent of changes in the magnets
or the wire, and so                      all

 servations by a simple proportion sum; and the numbers in the
last column are obtained as shown, and are a measure of the
 resistance of the liquid, but uncorrected by the comparison
plate. The three figures obtained differ; but the greatest
weight is given to the observation at the highest speed, and
'860 is taken as a fair mean. To make use of the observa
tion e, the probable zero must be found by examining the
numbers already obtained. . As they indicate a

This shifting       the zero caused more uncertainty than any

I SHOULD
     to my
                 like to add a few remarks by way of appendix
              paper    on the subject of recurring changes in the
universe (‘Nature, March 20, 1879, and Philosophical Maga
zine, August, 1879). All                    I
                                      wish to deal with is one point
regarding the physical premises upon which the view of
finality in the universe is based ; and the fact of having pro
posed a theory of the aether f (a body which affects this
question in the most intimate manner) may perhaps warrant
my saying a few words. It is of course not my intention
here to question in any way the conclusion of the tendency to
the establishment of a general equilibrium of temperature in
the universe.       My object is rather to suggest a reconciliation
of this with a means for recurring change.
   The view of those who believe that physical evidence points
to ultimate finality and cessation of life in the universe,
could not perhaps well be summarized with greater clearness
than in the following passage from Prof. Balfour Stewart's
work “The Conservation of Energy’ (3rd edition, 1874) under
heading “Probable Fate of the Universe,” viz.:-‘‘We have
spoken already about a medium pervading space, the office of
which appears to be to degrade and ultimately extinguish                                                all

of degradation cannot be eternal.              If we could view the
universe as a candle not lit, then it is perhaps conceivable to
regard it as having been always in existence; but if we regard
it rather as a candle that has been lit, we become absolutely
certain that it cannot have been burning from eternity, and
that a time will come when it will cease to burn. We are
led to look to a beginning in which the particles of matter
were in a diffuse chaotic state, but endowed with the power
of gravitation; and we are led to look to an end in which
the whole universe will be one equally heated inert mass, and
from which everything like life or motion or beauty will have
utterly gone away.”         [P. 153.]
   Here the key to the whole conclusion regarding finality in
universal change would seem to rest in the opening sentence,
viz.:-‘‘We have spoken already about a medium pervading
space, the office of which appears to be to degrade and ulti
mately eatinguish       all differential motion.” Does not this,
however, assume as a basis the old statical theory of a stag
nant aether whose parts are normally at rest, and the function
                                                                            be all

How about the        case,  however (it    may      asked),  under the
dynamical theory?—which makes the aether               active substance              an
whose particles are normally            rapid motion, and therefore

appears inevitable, the stellar or cosmical bodies of the universe
being then regarded merely as larger-scale masses immersed
in a smaller-scale gas—the universe coming to be comparable
(in principle at least) to a gigantic gas", of which the stellar
masses represent the molecules.    Drawing an analogy, there
fore, from the kinetic theory of gases, this view would ac
cordingly point to the conclusion that, consistently with un
limited variation in the energies of individual stellar masses,
the general distribution   of energy in the universe may be at
present uniform, if sufficiently large samples be taken.     For
we know that in the general case of portions of matter
moving under the kinetic theory (such as in a gas), equi
librium of temperature, although perpetually tending to
establish itself, is only possible per unit of volume, and that
individual molecules may possess                                              all

358        Prof. E. Wiedemann             on the     Behaviour of Gases
   It has been shown by these investigations that the usual
theory, which refers the emission of light by a gas under the
influence of the electric discharge to an increase of tem
perature up to the point of incandescence, is no longer tenable,
and that this point requires fresh experimental examination.
   Spectrum analysis, so far as it employs the electric dis
charge for the production of spectra, has to examine the
question       of the dependence of the spectra produced on the
quantity of electricity transmitted.            For this purpose we
must   pass discharges    of given quantities   of electricity through a
given gas ofdefinite pressure, observe the spectral phenomena,
and at the same time determine the magnitude of the quan
tities of energy or of heat given off by the discharges; for
these alone can furnish a measure of the resultant phenomena
of motion in the gas. As we cannot deal with a single dis
charge, we must determine the number of discharges which
correspond      to a given quantity of electricity.           It is abso
lutely necessary that the gas should return to                    original     its
condition before the entrance               of
                                        each new     discharge,       that              so
any previous heating may have ceased                                   be

especially that the gas should have become dark again.
    The present research        intended

     In
      correspondence with the problems for investigation, the
apparatus employed consisted       three parts:–(1) the source
                                            of
of the electricity, and the arrangements    measure the inten  to
sity  ofthe current; (2) the discharge-tube and     electrodes,              its

               under the Influence of                  the          Electric Discharge.                            359
the calorimeters, and arrangements for exhausting ; (3) the
arrangements for measuring the number of discharges.
    1. The source of electricity employed was usually a Töpler’s”
electrical machine with 20 revolving disks, which was driven by
a small Schmidt's water motor. In order to have a constant
stream of water, most of the experiments were performed at
night. In this way a constant velocity of revolution, and a con
stant deflection of the galvanometer included in the circuit,
could be maintained for hours together.
    The machine has a few drawbacks, in consequence of the
powerful evolution of electricity.          First, it attracts the dust
very largely, the disks become dirty, and the production of
electricity diminishes or even ceases altogether; moreover
large quantities of ozone are produced.          Both of these defects
are remedied pretty well by covering the machine over with
a wooden cover with glass sides, and placing vessels of linseed
oil under it f After use for several weeks the disks become
dirty in spite of                  all
                          precautions, and must then

    The galvanometer was a Wiedemann's reflecting galvano
  meter of moderate strength, with coils of gutta-percha covered
  copper wire. The distance between the telescope and scales
  was 189 centims.
      2. The discharge-tube includes the space containing the
   two electrodes             ...;
                         the part of the tube uniting them. This
   either was altogether absent so that the electrodes were imme
   diately opposed to each other, or consisted of tubes of various
           ºf
   shapes.   But care was taken to avoid any shape in which two
   portions of the tube would be parallel to each other, as, for ex
  ample, in a U-tube.       In this case induction-phenomena of a
 ".                  character occur.
        e electrodes were made of aluminium in all definitive
  experiments, since this metal alone is not subject to dissipation
  by the discharge. They were either balls of 5 millims. diameter,
  or points 3 millims, thick at the base and 12 millims. long.
      n conducting the electricity to the electrodes, in order to
  avoid as much as possible the scattering by points, and to ensure
 <U+017F>º     contact, the following arrangement was adopted (Plate IX.
    g. 1):—a is a glass-bulb, b the electrode, c a platinum wire
  screwed into it and covered with glass, d a glass tube joined
 to a by fusion, into which the wire c projects. The tube d can
 be filled with mercury, into which the wire conveying the
 electricity plunges. The discharge-tube is melted on at m.
 A similar arrangement is to be recommended for Geissler's
 tubes, which are much used, as they are easily broken by the
 pulling of the connecting wires at the projecting platinum
Wires.
     Ifthe heating was to be determined in the whole space
between the two electrodes, the whole apparatus was plunged
in a trough-shaped glass calorimeter of about 50 cubic centims.
capacity. The arrangement shown in Plate IX: fig. 2 was
employed to determine the heating at one electrode.     e is the

action is to be observed at one part of a tube and close to
the spectroscopic phenomena.
    The calorimetric fluid employed was turpentine.       It has
a small specific heat when equal volumes are compared,
and is a good insulator, a point of special importance when
wide tubes are employed.      The calorimeters themselves were
made of glass, after preliminary experiments with brass calo
rimeters       É.
                shown that the fraction of the energy of the gas
lost  by  radiation was excessively small.
i.
    The calorimeters with the discharge-tubes in them were
  laced in a cylindrical metallic vessel with double walls,
         introduced either simply from above, or through an
opening in the bottom. In this way irregular currents of air
 &c. were excluded, and, besides, a trustworthy correction for
 loss and gain by radiation during the experiment was ren
dered possible.

openings at the sides were employed.                                    The gas to be experi
mented upon was carefully dried and admitted into the com
pletely exhausted tube.          Only air and hydrogen were em
ployed for the most part.

portion of the tube is provided with a funnel-shaped portion
which is filled with mercury; so that if the joint becomes a
little loose it is not necessary to stop working.
    The lower end of the tube b is connected at o with one end

    The action of the pump is extremely simple. The vessel O
is first raised and mercury allowed to enter the bulb A, by
which the communication between A and B is interrupted.
The air is driven out of A, and escapes through the mercury

    I desire  to express my best thanks to Mr. Roth for the
 assistance he has rendered me        in the measurements.
                      3.   General Measurements.
    Three groups of observations were made, in order to obtain
a general idea of the way in which the thermic phenomena of
the tube depended on the pressure.
    1. The heating in the whole of a discharge-tube was
determined.
    2. The heating in a capillary tube was investigated, and
experiments made on the influence of the width of the tube
and of the shape of the electrodes.
    3. The heating at an electrode was determined when the
electrode was positive and when it was negative, and also
both when it was connected with the source of electricity and
when it was put to earth.
    In particular cases the number of discharges was deter
mined, and the measurements made with hydrogen-vacua,
and then repeated with air-vacua.              Further, air-sparks were
introduced into the       circuit, always     between the machine and
the discharge-tube.
    Further experiments were made on the influence of the
condensation of electricity on the walls of the discharge
        using mercury instead of turpentine as calorimetric
#.uid.
    The arrangement of the tables is always the same. The
first column, headed p, gives the pressure.                At very low
pressures which could not be read on the manometer the
degree of the exhaustion is denoted by a or war.
     he following columns give the corrected amounts of heat
ing of the calorimeter in one minute, calculated for an inten
sity of current corresponding to a galvanometer-deflection of
 100 millims.                             -
    + or — in the     heading    of a column indicates that the posi
tive or  negative electrode was connected with the machine, the
other pole being put to earth.
   The number of discharges given corresponds to a current
giving a deflection of 10 millims.
   I.  The heating in    the whole tube was       determined by means
of three different forms of apparatus.
   The first consisted of a glass vessel, I, of the form shown
in Plate IX. fig. 7. The distance of the electrodes was
16 millims., the water-equivalent of the whole apparatus
27.5 grammes.

   That the amounts of heat here, especially at high pressures,
are so much smaller than in the first case, is to be explained
by the fact that the potential necessary for each discharge is
here so much smaller than before, as the electrodes stood so
much nearer to each other. The minimum appears here at a
higher pressure than in the first case, since the decrease of
heating which occurs in the spark and at the positive electrode
is earlier compensated by the increase which takes place at
the negative pole.
   A third series of experiments is occupied with the determi
nation of the total heating in hydrogen when between two
ball-shaped electrodes is interposed a capillary tube about
1 millim. wide and 30 millims, long (Plate IX. fig.                                8).    In
the first series the apparatus broke,  consequence     the high
                                                      in                     of
potential necessary when the pressure was very small, since
the electrodes were somewhat too close together.       The two
series  ofobservations are therefore not  directly  comparable.
The first series gave:—
                         p                      +     |

  The second series,    which the water-equivalent was
                                  in                                                     per
ceptibly higher, gave:—
                                                +           -

                         ar                   0.73         0-48
  Here also we see that the total heating                         at   first diminishes
with decreasing pressure               (first   series) and then increases again
(second series).

#.     at high pressures when traversed by the discharge of a
  eyden battery or of an induction-coil has           been made
by Villari”. They are in complete agreement with the conse
quences which follow from mechanical principles, as is the case
with the problems treated by me. When, for example, Villari
finds that the heating in sparks between two spheres is nearly
proportional to the spark-length, that follows immediately from
the law established by Macfarlane and otherst, that the differ
ence of potential necessary to the commencement of discharge
between two spheres increases nearly                 to their dis
tance apart, at any rate for short sparks. The same results were
to be expected from the laws previously established connecting
                                   ..
striking-distance with quantity of electricity discharged. Wil
lari, however, is not         in his experiments to distinguish
between the heating at the electrodes and in the spark itself,
which corresponds to the capillary portion of a Geissler's tube.
  II.   Further, the amounts of heating produced in the tubes
connecting   the electrodes were determined when a spark of
10 millims. was included in the circuit, and when no spark
was included. The width of the capillary tube (arrangement
of fig. 3) was 0.4 millim.

    Here also the number of discharges was from 12 to 13
when a spark 10 millims. long was interposed.
    With reference to the great differences of the number of
discharges with and without interposed spark, the following
 general conclusion may be drawn from the observations:—
    (1) The heating in capillary tubes at pressures above 1 mil
 lim. is almost independent of the quantity of electricity passing
in each discharge, and nearly proportional to the whole quantity
 of electricity which passes, always provided that no
jar or condenser is included in the circuit.
                                                                                 %.          -
    The deviations from this law at pressures under 1 milim.,
 when the heating increases considerably when a spark is
 included, require further examination.
    (2) The heating produced by the positive discharge and by

372         Prof. E. Wiedemann on             the   Behaviour of Gases
the negative discharge is nearly the same, in spite - of the
difference in the number of the discharges.
   At a pressure of 0.7 millim., for example, the proportion of
the number of positive discharges to that of the negative
discharges is about as 1:4, the quantities of heat produced are
about 0.40 and 0°43.
   With decreasing pressure the heating diminishes rapidly,
without passing through a minimum corresponding to the
marimum number of discharges.       A slight increase, however,
was observed in some of the other tubes.
   A special series of experiments had for their object to decide
whether the heating in a capillary tube is dependent on the
form of the electrodes or not. The arrangement of fig. 9 was
employed. The measurements were made at several pressures,
and with either positive or negative electrode put to earth,
but without any spark included. The conducting-wires from
the machine were plunged in c or d, the wires leading to the
galvanometer in a or b.
   The following table gives the amounts of heat produced:—

   The amounts of heat, then, are in general nearly independent
of the form of the electrodes.
   This result        agrees   with       that found         when          sparks     are
included.
   Moreover the number of discharges alters very little with
the form of the electrodes.     Since somewhat long and wide
portions of tube intervened between the electrodes and the
capillary tube, the discharges were somewhat irregular, as
they usually are in similar cases.
   G. Wiedemann " has shown by experiments with Holtz's
machine that the quantities of heat produced in a wide tube
and in a narrow tube per unit length are always equal—a result
which has since been confirmed by Naccari and Bellatif by
use of the induction-coil.
     I have,
          in the next place, made a further series of experi
ments with different thick-walled capillary tubes.

   They were joined to each other by fusion, placed horizontally,
                       i<U+017F>
and calorimeters pushed over them as shown in fig. 4. The
narrower tube                a diameter of 0.6 millim., and the portion
surrounded by the calorimeter a length of 42 millims. ; for
the wider tube the corresponding numbers were 2 millims.
and 45 millims. The ratio of the sectional areas of the tubes
was therefore 1:10; the water-equivalent was nearly the same
for the two calorimeters.
   The following table gives, in the usual way, the amounts
of heat observed in the two calorimeters, which were always

   The tables show (1) that, in agreement with the earlier
results, the difference of heating with and without spark is not
very great, both in wide and in narrow tubes; that, further,
the amounts of heat produced in the tubes of different width,
with the same length of spark, do not differ very greatly. In
both cases, however, at low pressures there appear considerable.
deviations from these laws. In these, as in the former obser
vations, the amount of heat increases perceptibly when the
spark is included; and, moreover, the heating in the narrow
tube is decidedly greater than in the wide one.                          Further
insight into these relationships can only be obtained by ad
ditional experiments.
   A further series of experiments was occupied with the
behaviour of still wider tubes.
   Two tubes, a capillary tube and a wider tube, of diameters
0.5 millim. and 4 millims., and thickness of glass 2 millims.
and 1 millim., were united and included in the circuit, the
calorimeters filled with turpentine, and the amounts of heat
determined. The values obtained are given in the following
tables.        Those under A relate to the case in which the
electrode next the capillary tube was put to earth, those under
B to that in which the electrode next the wide tube was in
connexion with the earth.                  The signs + and — mark the

    These      tables afford, in the first place, a confirmation of
 the former results, inasmuch as in narrow tubes the heating
 is very nearly independent of the quantity of electricity
transmitted, especially at high pressures.                         Further, deviations
from this law occur, especially with the positive discharge.                             In
 the wide tube they are perceptible optically as well as thermi
 cally.      By including sparks, a wide tube may be made dark
 which was luminous before, whilst a still further increase of
 the spark-length calls forth again an increase in brightness.
 With this there goes hand in hand a diminution and subsequent
increase in the heating of the calorimeters, as the observations
 at the pressure 38, for example, show. It is nearly indif
ferent whether the electrode nearest to the wide tube is con
nected with the source of electricity or with the earth.
    This peculiar behaviour of positive electricity becomes much
 more marked when we use calorimeters with mercury instead
of turpentine.
    The following table gives a series of such comparative
measurements, which were made at very low pressures, whilst
the electrode nearest the wide tube was connected with the
machine:—

     Whilst during                the passage             of the negative discharge through
the wide tube only relatively small changes in the heat produced
occur with changes in the spark-length, these become very con
siderable (from 0-19 to 2-72) when the positive discharge takes
place through the wide tube.    At the same time there were
always strong charges on the tube-wall, which led to a

    The conclusions to be drawn from the tables are as                fol
lows:—
    (1) The heating at the positive electrode diminishes continu
ally and rapidly as the pressure decreases.          At very low pres
sures there is occasionally   a small increase.      At   the same time
the glass round it shines with green light, as          if the electrode
                          º
became temporarily negative.
    (2) The heating at the negative electrode at first decreases as
the pressure becomes less, and then increases rapidly.
      he heating results          from the heating of the electrode
 itself, partly from that of the enclosed             and partly from
that of the glass envelope.                      #.
                                     At quite low pressures, at the
 negative pole, where the glass becomes luminous, no doubt the
 last of these is the most important.          I  have calculated how
great the heating of each square cubic centimetre of the wall
 would be under the conditions of the experiments, on the
 assumption that the whole of the heat at the end of the
discharge issuing from the negative electrode is produced
upon the glass wall.        I  chose for this purpose the obser
vations with     point electrodes given under a, at very low
pressures.     The luminous surface of the glass had a mag
nitude of 5 square centimetres ; upon this surface there was
produced in each minute a quantity of heat of 0.77 x 6.4
 =49 calories, or 0.98 per square centimetre. By way of
comparison, it may be mentioned that the radiation of the sun
causes each minute a production of heat on each square centi
metre of the earth's surface amounting to about 2 calories.            It
is to be observed, however, that the discharge from the nega
tive pole lasts only a very short time (not even the thousandth
part of the whole time), whilst the radiation of the sun acts
continuously for the whole time.
    A large number of measurements with electrodes of dif
ferent forms were made, to determine the influence upon the
heating at the electrode of introducing air-sparks of varying

   Hence the temperature in these narrow tubes is already
very low; in one ten times as wide it might sink to 100° C.
   This is a further confirmation of the previously stated law
that a gas may be rendered luminous by electric discharges with
out any corresponding elevation of temperature.

on the right is balanced by a weight, which is seen depending
on the left. The whole is surmounted by the bulb of air; and
the vacant space above the mercury upon the right is the Tor
ricellian vacuum of the barometric column. Changes in tem
perature are shown by this thermometer in the varying
angular positions of a needle, prolonged from one or other of
the radii of the wheel, and counterpoised by a piece of metal
on the other side.    When the centre of gravity of this system
has been made coincident with the point on which it turns, the
liquid, under changes of temperature, is almost absolutely
motionless, whilst the tube which holds it moves.     By bring

driven by clockwork at an even speed, we have a thermograph

sages from his own account (published in 1823) of the first work
ing electric telegraph, erected by him in 1816. These passages are
interesting as illustrations of the discouragement which inventors
often have to encounter in bringing their discoveries into practical
operation, and which were not wanting in the case of the electric
telegraph, and also as historical evidence of the mean opinion held
by men of eminence and authority half a century ago about an in
vention which is now found to be one of the most important instru
ments of modern civilization.

            THE LAW OF ELECTROMAGNETIC MACHINES.

   ASK of the Academy permission to submit some of the most re
    markable results, all verified by experiment, which are deduced
from the formula          I
                    had the hononr of presenting at the last sitting.
   That formula expresses the law of an important class of magneto
electric machines, characterized by the condition that the variations
of the primitive magnetic field follow the law of sines. It gives

   The theory indicates, and experiment verifies in the most rigorous
manner, that the maximum value of the electromotive force E,
during the course of a period is proportional to the velocity; if                     its
value when the machine makes one revolution per second

e, and if there are     periods per revolution, we can put, for
                           n                                                      given

The formula         of   the mean intensity then becomes

It is seen that this intensity does not increase indefinitely with the
velocity, but tends towards a limit value
                                           I=–tº–
                                                   nºr”U’
which is besides very near those obtained for moderate velocities
and weak resistances.
   The expression of the total electrodynamic work of the machine,
designating by I' the square root of the mean of the squares of the
intensities, is

This expression tends towards zero when the resistance increases
indefinitely, and becomes 0 when the circuit is opened; experiment
shows, in fact, that in this case we have no other work to overcome
than that of the passive resistances".      But, contrary to what takes
place with a pile,      its
                      maximum does not correspond              external                          to      an
resistance =0. The work                     at
                                 first increases when the resistance                                                     is
augmented, and passes through                          a    maximum corresponding                                  to   the
equation                 `-

  The conditions        of
                       the maximum      work can always (as of seen)                                          is

ON  THE ABSOLUTE MEASURE OF PELTIER's PHENOMENON AT THE
   CoNTACT of A METAL AND ITs solution.             BY E. BouTYf.
   Two coppered thermometers, as nearly equal as possible, and
sensitive to gºo”, were lowered at the distance of 1 decim. from
each other, into a large vessel full of solution of sulphate or nitrate
of copper, which stood in a large cold-water bath. Thereupon the
temperature of the solution changed in 5 minutes Tºm’ only.         Be
tween the thermometers a current of the intensity i was conducted
through during two minutes; the quantities of heat then observed
on the two thermometers were proportional to W = +ai-H bi”,
where a and b are constants.     That the indications of the thermo
meters were in fact  proportional  to the quantities of heat produced
upon them follows from experiments, in which they were surrounded
in the fluid with German-silver spirals protected from the latter.
On the passage of currents i, through the spirals the heatings were
proportional to i,”.   In absolute measure (centim., gram, second)

                RESULTS OF PENDULUM EXPERIMENTS.
   BY C. s. PEIRCE, AssistANT CoAST AND GEODETIC SURVEy.
   The following are the results obtained from observations made
by me, for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, at four important
stations, for the purpose of comparing the lengths of the seconds'
pendulum, together with reductions to the sea-level and to the
equator.     In making     the last reduction    I
                                                 have assumed the ellipti
city to be = 1 : 293, which is the latest result from measurements
of arcs.                  At station.     At sea-level.   At equator.

   The differences of the figures in the last column from 0.991
metre, a value conveniently near their mean, when reduced to oscil
lations per diem are:—Hoboken + 0:01"; Paris +0.58"; Berlin
 –0-59"; Kew 4-0.36°. The following are the residuals of former
observations according to Clarke (‘Geodesy, p. 349):-
        New York + 0.20";    Paris —3:29";    Kew 4-2-89”.
    Colonel Clarke has used a value of the ellipticity = 1 : 292-2, de
rived from pendulum experiments.         This slight difference, how
ever, is not important.
    It should be explained that the result for Hoboken is derived
from [Tº Inv.] “Regular Set,” given on page 318, and also on
page 416 of the Report of the Superintendent of the U.S. Coast
º
and Geodetic Survey for 1876. This number is treated as explained
on page 319, where in the second line from the bottom for [Tº Rev.]
       [Tº Inv.]. The altitude of the Hoboken station is stated on
page 204. The numbers for the European stations are copied from
page 320.
    The length which       I
                         have taken as the metre has been derived
from the German Eichungsamt, as fully explained in my Report.
This is about 19.2 microns shorter than the quantity which is con
 sidered to be a metre in our own office of weights and measures,
and is admitted in Berlin to be doubtful.      It is impossible to              fix
the true metre      present;

  current is of considerable intensity.
     According to Colley, in a rotating mirror a series of bright stars
  irregularly distributed upon a feebly illuminated ground are at the
  same time perceived; so that consequently the individual discharges
  issue from different parts of the electrode, while the time of the
  passage of the current is very short in comparison with that of the
 intermissions.
     The spectrum at a negative electrode of platinum in dilute sul
 phuric acid shows, when 96 Bunsen elements are employed, at first
 the red (bright) and blue hydrogen-lines.              In solutions of chloride
 of sodium and chloride of lithium the lines of those metals are seen
 in addition, and also (particularly five) platinum-lines are well seen.
     Only by chance is the electrode herewith so strongly heated that
 the liquid no longer wets                        it.

                                        propose in this paper to
give a summary of the results. . The experiments were made
             in the Physical Laboratory of the University of
  dinburgh, where             I
                       had the ever-ready advice of Professor
Tait; and in making the observations                      I
                                           had the assistance of
several gentlemen, particularly of Mr. R.    Simpson, M.A.,andJ.
Mr. P. M. Playfair, M.A.
   The method adopted can be readily explained with the help
of the woodcut (fig. 1), which represents the apparatus in situ.
The electricity was furnished by means of the Holtz machine,
which had one conductor (generally the negative) always earthed
by means of a wire, and the other conductor connected with the
rod passing through the neck of the air-pump receiver. The
diameter of the receiver is 19 centimetres.     The electrodes
were in general circular  disks; and the one was screwed on to
the rod mentioned, the other to a short rod normal to the plate
of the air-pump, and in conducting connexion with         metal              its

                      Discharge of Electricity.                 391
 parts and the earth.     A wire covered with gutta percha con
nected the insulated parts with the spherical ball A, which was
supported on a varnished glass stem surrounded at the base
by pumice-stones soaked in sulphuric acid. The equal and
 similarly insulated ball B was connected with the insulated
half-ring of the Thomson's reflecting electrometer.       The long
range absolute electrometer represented at the corner of the
table was obtained on loan from Sir William Thomson, to
reduce the results to absolute measure.
   Thus an essential feature of the method, due to Professor
Tait, is the introduction of the two insulated balls A and B,
by the separation of which to a greater or less distance the
effect of a charge upon the electrometer could be reduced to
any convenient amount. By this means we have been able to
measure very high potentials. When the potential of A is
raised by working the machine, the potential of B is raised
simultaneously; and this goes on until a discharge takes place
between the electrodes inside the receiver. We found that it
was possible, by breaking the contact between the conductors
of the Holtz machine before beginning to turn the wheel, and
by turning slowly and uniformly, to cause the wire-image to
move along the scale continuously, and to be at rest at the
instant of the discharge. After the passage of the discharge
the image fell back to a position very near to the one it started
from ; and the coincidence was improved by discharging the
couple of Leyden jars, which were generally attached to the
conductors of the Holtz machine, for the purpose of making
the charging more gradual.         We noted the latter position of
the  index,  and took the difference as proportional to the differ
ence of   potentials of the electrodes at the instant of discharge;
for we   found, by  putting  a charge on the ball A, dividing the
charge by means of an equal ball, and so on, that the differ
ences referred to were proportional to the amount of charge
on A. Any escape of electricity from the charged conductor
was at once made evident by the behaviour of the wire-image;
it was this escape which put a limit to our measurements of
  otential, and not the range of the electrometer arrangement.
}. general we took three readings for each entry, so that we
might be able, by taking their mean, to eliminate any error
due to small variations in the mode of passing of the spark.
A notion of the amount of this error may be obtained by         in
                      #.
specting the readings given below (p. 398). The method
admits of so much                 that we have taken a series of

Measurement of the Difference of Potential required to pass a
  Spark through Air at the Atmospheric Pressure between
  Parallel Metal Plates at different Distances.
  This problem, as is well known, was investigated by Sir
William Thomson* for distances between 0025 and 15 cen
timetre.           I
              have been able to extend the investigation to a
distance of 1 centim. The plates used as electrodes were two
equal circular brass disks of 10 centims. diameter.     Both were
rounded at the    edge;  and the lower one had       face slightly                      its
convex. The distance between the        plates  was measured by
applying    glass millimetre-scale

of the rod. The shortest distance for which   readings  were taken
was 0.25 centim., and the greatest about          centim.; within                  1
that range the sparks were central and straight, while beyond
   they passed       curved line between the edges                                            of

   Five series      observations were taken, and were found                                                       to

    We took four series of readings for a 5-centimetre spark
through air between the parallel disks above mentioned, vary
       the pressure from 20 millims. of mercury to the atmo
spheric. On                  3  I have plotted two of these: the
upper curve was first obtained with the capacity of the con
ductor increased by the couple of Leyden jars; and the lower
was obtained immediately afterwards with the jars off. Each
of the series gave an experimental curve which coincided with
a hyperbola, and more closely than in the case of the former

 crease in the value of a, though small, is so decided that we
 may infer that the greater the length of the spark the greater

   When p is small compared with 203, we have
                         V=Av'203 Vp;
which agrees with what the conclusion of Masson" leads to
when corrected by means of the law regulating the discharge
between two balls (v. infra, p. 402).
    Messrs. De La Rue and Müller f have investigated, in the
case of hydrogen, the nature of the curve for pressures lower
than that of minimum electric strength (.6 millim.).                 The
difference of potential is inversely proportional to the cube
root of the distance.     Assuming that the discharge through
their  long  tube (33 inches long and 2 inches diameter) and
between a   ring and a point electrodes is similar to that between
our disks at 5 centim. apart,       I  obtain for the complement of
the equation W = 024V (p”+ 600p} the following,
                           V – •67 ---
                                       1
                                     &/p'
as the equation which is true for pressures less than 6 millim.
Let N denote the number of molecules in unit of volume;
then when p is less than 6 millim., V is inversely propor
tional to VN; when p is greater than 6 millim. but less than
600, V is directly proportional to v^N; and when p is greater
than 600 millims., V is directly proportional to N. Thus, on
the one side of 6 millim. the greater the number of molecules
the greater is the facility for the discharge; while on the
 other side the greater the number of molecules the greater is
the resistance to the discharge. This appears to be a stron
argument in favour of Mr. Crookes's contention for a                .#
state of matter; and the pressure 6 millim. seems, in the case
of hydrogen, to separate the two states. It is probable that
the mode of discharge is different in the two regions.
        Effect of Changing the Capacity of the Conductor.
    The first two series of observations for varying pressure
 indicate that a change of the capacity of the charged con
 ductor has little effect on the difference of potential required
 to produce the discharge between the disks. But to test this
                    I
 question further, took readings for a 5-centim. spark through
 air at the atmospheric pressure, with the capacity of the
  charged conductor, 1st, increased by means of a large Leyden
 jar, 2nd, increased by means of the couple of small Leyden
jars of the IIoltz, and, 3rd, without being increased.           I append

one another and with the

distance between the wires
was 4 millims.       The figure
represents the apparatus sus
pended      by means of the
upper wire from one con
ductor of the Holtz machine,
and the lower wire connected
with the positive conductor.                                 -
Only the wire which at the                                 b
time was not bearing the
weight could be heated with
out changing the distance of
the wires. The wire operated
 on was made red-hot by                         p
bringing the terminals of a
 battery of four Bunsen's elements into contact with it at two
 points one inch apart ; and the charging was made as soon as
 possible after the heating.     Before heating, the spark re
 quired a difference of potential of 125; after heating, a mean
 difference of potential of 93. This was in the case of a single
 spark. When a continued spark was taken, a similar dimi
 nution of the deflection was observed.       Here the effect could
 not be due to a rarefaction of the air between ; it must have
 been due to something at the surface of the electrodes; and
                                           I
 from the transient nature of the effect, am inclined to ascribe
 it to the temperature of the surface directly.

     To investigate this question, constructed the apparatus in
 fig. 3. A glass cylinder c was fitted into two brass plates p
 by means of grooves. The brass disks d, which were those used
  in the previous experiments, were screwed on, the one to a
  brass rod rising from the lower plate, the other to a rod
  moving inside a tube fixed to the upper plate; and they
  were set at a distance of 9 centim. apart.             e upper plate
  contains an orifice to allow the air to          escape     when the
  lower plate is heated, and a hole for the insertion of the
  thermometer. The lower plate was put to earth, and the

thermometer indicated a range from
25°C. to 245° C.; and sparks were
taken at each interval of 10° during
both heating and cooling. The de
flections are represented on Plate
XI. diag. 4.      †.ordinates of the
cooling-curve are less than the cor
responding ordinates of the heating
curve—a result confirmed by two
other series of observations.   The
falling off cannot have been en
tirely due to a leaking of the charge
of the electrometer during the time occupied by the observa
tions; for readings taken after the lapse of twenty-four hours
showed that not more than one         ...
                                        of the difference could
be so accounted for.      The bulb of the thermometer being
in the   position indicated by the figure, gives the tempera
ture of the air between the disks : hence it is probable that
the effect was mainly due to the temperature or other state
of the disks.
   These curves also throw some light upon the question
                                  §:
whether the difference of potential required to effect a dis
charge depends upon the temperature of the gas only if the
change of temperature cause              of density.   I
                                                       have cal
culated the density of the air between the disks at the different
temperatures, and plotted the difference of potential as ordi
nate to the density as abscissa.     The curve obtained should
coincide   approximately   with a portion  of a hyperbola if the
above   question is to be answered in the affirmative. Ifind that
it is convex towards the axis of abscissae, and that it does not
look like passing through the origin.

modes  of discharge—by means of threads of solid particles,
by motion of the liquid, by a disruptive discharge, and by
motion of gas-bubbles. When a chain of particles was formed,
the index of the electrometer indicated the passage of a cur
rent, which, when sufficiently great, broke the thread and
turned into a spark-discharge. The liquid was more easily

set in motion when         surface was not much above the upper

them from escaping; and we observed that they were more
strongly repelled when the disk was electrified positively than
when negatively. At           diminished pressure they were ob

402               Dr. A. Macfarlane on            the   Disruptive
Measurement       of                of Potential required to pass a

  Discharge through          Air
                              at the Atmospheric Pressure between
   two   Balls,   between a Ball and a Plate, and between a Point
   and a Plate.
   In the first case the electrodes were two spherical balls,
each 1.5 centim. in diameter; and they were attached in the
same manner as the disks. The curve obtained (diag. 6) coin
cides at the beginning with a parabola, but is afterwards bent
in towards the axis of abscissae.   It is quite similar to that
obtained by Mascart under the same conditions".   When the
distance was 8 centims., violet sparks began to precede the
white spark, and the electrometer simultaneously began to
indicate the occurrence of a small discharge before the com
plete discharge.    This caused the reading to be somewhat
more   ambiguous.     At 10 centims. the electricity began to
escape from the insulated wire.
   On the following day a series of readings for the second
pair of electrodes was obtained, and without any change in
the arrangement other than the substitution for the lower ball
of a circular plate 16.2 centims, in diameter. The plate was
uninsulated, and the upper ball charged positively. The curve
is drawn on the same diagram with that for the two balls; it
§.
also coincides with a parabola at the beginning, but at the
  reater distances is still more bent towards the axis of abscissae.
        sparks (giving an incomplete discharge) began much
sooner, at 3.5 centims. compared with 8 centims.
   A series of readings for the third pair of electrodes was ob
tained on the third day. A conical brass point was substi
tuted for the upper ball. With the increased capacity due to
the couple of Leyden jars the readings were regular; without
it they were irregular. Up to 5 millims. the discharge was
effected by a spark; but for greater distances there was only
a faint brush or glow at the point, accompanied by a partial
discharge.
 Comparison   of the Positive and Negative Electric Discharge.
   To  complete  the preceding investigation, it is necessary in
the second and third cases to take readings for several distances,
with the ball or the point charged first with the one and then
with the other kind of electricity. This have been able to    I
do; but as it was in the United College, St. Andrews, the
apparatus was somewhat different.       Instead of the receiver
                   I
arrangement, had a Henley's discharger, using respectively
for charged electrode the conical point of one of the rods and

a spherical ball 0-5 inch in diameter fixed on the point. A
circular plate, 7 inches in diameter and fixed on the other rod,
formed the uninsulated electrode.     The sign of the electricity
was changed by merely charging the one or the other paper
conductor of the machine.      The electrometer had either half
ring capable of being insulated ; and was thereby enabled to             I
take readings in both directions for each kind of spark, and so
eliminate any difference due to a bias in the instrument.

 make the comparison at a standard distance and pressure; for,
 as has been shown, the curves for the different dielectrics, when
 the distance or pressure is varied, are not similar to one ano
 ther. The gases were compared directly for the length of
 spark mentioned; and the ratio was taken from the mean of
 eight or so readings. As the liquids could not be compared
 directly for so long a spark, the comparison was made at
 '4 centim. and the readings reduced to 5 centim. by means
 of the appropriate laws. The paraffin examined is of low
 melting-point.     We liquefied it and poured it into the vessel
 containing the disks, took several 3-centim. sparks through
 it in the liquid condition, and, after allowing it to solidify for
 twenty-four hours, took one spark through it to determine                                          its

change the band spectrum into a line spectrum in a gas of
unit-pressure, in which of course the assumption is made that
 for a given volume the above quantity of heat is proportional
 to the pressure.   The measurements were made with two dif
 ferent tubes, of radii 0-304 and 0.183 millim., and are given in
 the following tables without exception, and in the order in
 which they were made. The length of the portion of tube in
 the calorimeter was 42 millims.; the water-equivalents of the
 two calorimeters were 11.84 and 12:08.           Some of the num
 bers were certainly too small, since at the moment the striking

     2. It was further examined whether the negative discharges
 which excite the green light, the so-called kathode-rays, do
 really propagate themselves only in straight lines. For this
 purpose the apparatus fig.11 was employed. If a was negative
 and b positive, the discharge from a struck first upon the
 glass wall at s, causing it to shine brightly, and then upon
 the bend at m (when the angle at m was about 30°), where
 bright green light also appeared. On the other hand, the tube
 was only feebly illuminated from s to m and m to                       whilst           l;

     That this    spot   of light  is not produced by light which has
 undergone several reflections in the interior of the tube s m l
 may be seen in two ways: first, there was no violet spot when
 the positive discharge traversed the tube without the pro
 duction of green light; and, further, the green spot alters                                               its

   An experiment to determine whether there was any differ
ence in time between the appearance of the violet light and of
the green gave no reliable result—partly, no doubt, because of
the feebleness of the light at c.
   4.   Ihave, further, made experiments to determine whether
the kathode-rays propagate themselves with a measurable ve
locity; and employed for this purpose a discharge-tube 1 metre
long, provided with a disk electrode at one end, which at a
sufficient exhaustion sent the kathode-rays through the entire
tube. When the tube was viewed in a revolving mirror, the
phosphorescence appeared at the same instant at both ends of
the tube.
   5. In order to examine the influence of the shape of the
electrodes on the number of discharges, and the potential ne–
cessary to produce them, the following experiments were made.
   The following pieces of apparatus were connected together

by fusion onto a forked tube:—1st, the apparatus fig. 11 from
a to m ; secondly, the apparatus fig. 10;        a discharge
tube similar to fig. 11, except that at b there was a disk parallel
to a. The whole was exhausted, so that when the disks were
i.
negative the whole tube shone brightly with green light.        In
the revolving mirror the following results were obtained:—
   (a) With the apparatus fig. 10, no difference whether the
         or the negative electrode was put to earth; the green
  and of light appeared almost entirely continuous.
   (b) With the apparatus with the two disks the same is the
CaSe.
   (c) With the apparatus fig. 11, when the disk is negative
                                                      §
no discontinuity is observed in the revolving mirror; but if it
is positive, then the appearances represented in fig. 13 are
observed. They consist of single, sharp, very bright images
of the tube, e. g. b and d, at the side of          is seen a much
feebler preceding discharge, a a, cc, sharply bounded at
commencement and         nearly equal intensity throughout.

of about 40 centims., that without altering the connexions
it could be brought between the electrodes or removed. In
the former position it intercepted the kathode-rays issuing
from the negative electrode, whilst in the latter they had a free
path. The intensity of the current was the same in both cases.
   7. Reitlinger* has shown that when stratifications form
about the positive electrode in a tube traversed by a current,
their number is considerably increased by the approach of a
magnet from the negative pole. The increase is caused by the
advance of those nearest the negative electrode, and the ap
pearance of new ones at the positive pole.        I have observed
                                                           ºi.
that the mean distance of the layers is not much altered in the
process.    When, by carrying the exhaustion far enough, all
the stratifications have been made to disappear,         have suc                    I
ceeded in producing new ones by                         magnet to
the electrode.    The phenomenon is especially beautiful when
the  positive electrode is a point; the stratifications seem then
to float up  round          it.
   The phenomena are seen most distinctly when the quantities
                                                                            lºft

mirror.     It is, further, of importance that the quantity of
 electricity produced can be varied simply by a change in the
 velocity of revolution of the machine and without alteration of
 the connexions. The introduction of resistances (which would
 cause complications in the processes of discharge) is therefore
 rendered unnecessary.
    By the introduction of resistances into the circuit the mode
 of discharge is in general not altered, but the quantity of elec
 tricity which passes suddenly in each discharge is increased.
 Conditions are much more complicated when the induction
 coil is employed”.
    At each breaking and closing of the primary current we
 have, besides the principal discharge, a whole series of partial
 discharges of decreasing intensity.         That we have not only
 a single discharge traversing the tube is seen by the use of the
 rotating mirror.     But each of the partial discharges lasts a
 certain length of time, during which the electricity flows gra
 dually from the coil to the electrodes; it will therefore again
 either be itself composed of a series of partial discharges, or
 correspond to a more or less continuous discharge of electri
 city. The images of the discharges do not consist of separate
 sharp lines, as with the electrophorus-machines, but of more
 or less broad bands in which maxima and minima occur.

418       Prof. E. Wiedemann on the Behaviour of Gases
cases, the discharge of the battery, according to the conditions
existing in the battery itself, is either altogether discontinuous,
or takes place in such a way that stronger discharges cause
the chief discharge, upon which follows a continuous discharge
gradually becoming weaker, and so on.
    But even if the discharges are completely continuous, do      I
not believe that they can be employed in spectroscopic inves
tigations, since the final temperature of the gas depends on so
many circumstances which cannot be exactly determined—
for example, upon the radiation-coefficient,       Wii     varies with
the temperature.
                     Theoretical Considerations.
    If we endeavour, from the above facts and others yet to be
mentioned, to represent to ourselves the mode in which the
electric discharge takes place through a gas, we see, in the
first place, that the theory proposed by G. Wiedemann and
R. Rühlmann is not supported by these facts. According to
this theory, the discharge is carried on by molecules charged
with electricity which are driven off from the electrode, and
which, upon collision with other molecules, yield up their
electricity to them.      The same theory has been adopted, in a
somewhat different       form,  by Crookes to explain the pheno
mena described by him, but most of which, though no doubt
without his knowledge, had been long ago made known by
Hittorf, and then by Goldstein and others. According to this
theory, the molecules must possess velocities corresponding
g.
to the velocity of propagation of electricity in gases. But we
know, from Wheatstone's" experiments on the discharge in
  ases, that this is certainly greater than 200,000 metres, or 30
             geographical (= 124 British statute) miles. But
it is  quite certain that the molecules do not possess so great a
velocity of translation measured in the direction of the cur
rent. Dr. von Zahn has observed the lines of the spectrum
given by a Geissler's tube, first when the axis of the tube and
the axis of the collimator of his spectroscope were parallel,
and then when they were at right angles, and observed no
displacement of the lines, although the dispersion was so
#.      that a displacement of 4% of the distance between the
   -lines could have been observed.        A displacement of this
magnitude would, in accordance with Doppler's principle,
                *;
have corresponded to a velocity of 4 geographical miles; and
a velocity of 30 geographical miles would have produced a
displacement            equal to the entire interval between the

two D-lines.       So great an increase of the normal velocity
of the molecules is therefore quite improbable".
   According to my view, we may imagine to ourselves the
phenomena of the discharge somewhat as follows:—The elec
tricity produced by the machine, which we may imagine as
free acther, is accumulated on the surface of the electrodes
partly as free electricity, and there is prevented from passin
into the surrounding gas by the mutual action between it an
the molecules of the metal; and a transference can only take
place when

                     density has reached

 on  their axes, maintain        definite position.

    That there is really such an excess of internal motion in
 gases rendered luminous by electricity is shown by their low
 temperature. The change of motion of oscillation into mo
tion of translation takes place with very great rapidity.                    I
 have shown on p. 416 that, according to the laws of conduc
 tion of heat, in a tube 1 centim. wide, even after Tokyo second,
a perceptible fraction of the original energy must exist in the
centre of the tube, yet nevertheless it is seen in the rotating
mirror to be discontinuously illuminated, just as a narrow
tube would be; so that we must conclude that the trans
ference of the internal motions produced by the current into
heat is much more rapid than the conduction of heat itself in
the gas.
    T.    vibrations produced by the electric discharge may
become so energetic that the molecules                themselves fall to
pieces and are resolved into their constituent atoms, just as
we observe decomposition when we receive the chemically
active rays on silver chloride, or an increase of affinity when
they fall upon chlorine.
    If  the oscillatory motions produce a decomposition of the
molecules, the energy necessary for the decomposition is
brought to the molecules from the source of electricity, and
is again given up to the calorimeter when they reunite.
Whether the whole quantity of heat produced in this case
results from the latter process cannot be decided off hand.
ferent names for the same phenomenon.        Fluorescence and phosphores
cence differ only in degree. Fluorescent light lastin            ly for only
an instant could never be observed. The time during which the lumino
sity lasts is determined by the rapidity with which the internal motions
of the molecules equalize themselves, and consequently by the mutual      in
fluence of the molecules in their internal motions.      With solid bodies
this is certainly relatively small: the molecules vibrate about their posi
tions of equilibrium; and the elongations are so small that the actions
of neighbouring molecules on the different parts of the same molecule
are very little different. Only thus can we explain and understand the a
pearance of sharp absorption-bands in the case of solid bodies, since light
emitted by solid bodies can still interfere when there is a great difference
of path (compare Wied. Ann. v. p. 500, 1878). The same holds good for
fluids: here also, besides the motion of translation of the molecules, we
have vibrations of the whole molecules; for otherwise the law of change
of friction with temperature would be the same for gases and for
fluids, whereas it increases with the temperature in the former case and
decreases in the latter.   With liquids also the time during which a mole
cule vibrates uninfluenced is therefore relatively large, and the transfer
ence of energy follows relatively slowly. This will take place with gases
most easily and rapidly, where the mean path-length alone is of account;
and therefore the name fluorescence is first applicable here. But here
also the fluorescent light will last at least as
between two collisions.

               under the Influence of the Electric Discharge.
It  is possible that a first fraction of the electricity transmitted
is used up in producing an increase of the mean temperature
resulting from a transformation of oscillatory motion, that by
this an unstable condition of the molecule is brought about,
and the remainder of the electricity completes the decompo
sition.
   There is a remarkable parallelism between the production
of heat caused by a ray of light in a feebly absorbing medium
and that which is caused by the electric discharge.
    (1)    If
           a conically enlarging beam of light propagate itself
in a feebly absorbing medium, the quantity of heat developed
is nearly the same in every section of the beam; in the same
way the heat produced by an electric discharge is the same in
each section.
   (2) If we increase the intensity of the ray of light, but allow
it to pass for a proportionately smaller time, an equal quantity
is absorbed in the two cases; the same holds good for the dis
charge when we increase                        its
                                 strength, but decrease        fre                            its
quency.
     (3)   we increase the optical absorption by, for example,
           If
increasing the number           absorbing particles
                                      of                   the absorbing      in
solution, the quantity        heat produced

                                       the pressure increases.
      seems therefore very probable that the absorption

    The great differences in the behaviour of positive and nega
tive electricity may perhaps be explained by assuming that
 the propagation of negative electricity alone depends upon
 the communication of electric polarization, whilst that of posi
                                                                                           º
 tive electricity is associated with a transference of free aether
 from molecule to molecule, as indeed Von Ettingshausen”
has recently concluded from the experiments of Hallf.
    We should thus have explained at once the difference in
potential necessary for the commencement of discharge from
 the negative and positive electrodes.              At the               elec
 trode the resolution of the dielectric polarization alone is ne
 cessary, whilst at the positive the attraction of the material
 molecules for the aether has also to be overcome.
    The propagation of the discharge issuing from the negative
 electrodes obeys nearly the laws of light.                From each point
of the electrode there apparently issues a feebly diverging
 bundle of kathode-rays, which behaves in                    further course     its
almost   exactly    like     beam  a     light,  casting

tribution of the free electricity on the walls of the tube on the
free current-electricity.      The wall, turned towards a positive
discharge, then naturally plays the part of a negative electrode.
In what way the discharges issuing from the two electrodes
equalize themselves is still an open question.
   I  have already shown ", and also mentioned above, that the
               produced by the kathode-rays cannot be caused
   y projected molecules.                    If
                                  we were even to assume that the
thickness of a layer of such projected particles amounted to
a whole centimetre, that it therefore possessed a mass rela
tively great, yet, in order to produce the observed heating
of the tube above the negative electrode, it must possess velo
cities of 100,000 metres or more.
    Gintlf and Pulujt seek to refer the phenomena to a pro
jection of the substance of the electrodes; but since with alu
 minium electrodes, for example, no decrease of the electrodes
 is observed, the velocity must be immense.                 This view is
 therefore scarcely tenable.         Moreover         the other pheno

the other connected        by a discharge-tube and galvanometer
with the earth.
   The deflection amounted to 145 millims., with a pressure of
about 10 millims. in the discharge-tube; so that a deflection
of about 1.5 millim. would correspond to a discharge. The
quantity of electricity given by each discharge would therefore
be sufficient to convert the band spectrum into the line spec
trum in a tube of 1 to 2 millims. width (p. 409).       But if we
have even a very powerful excitation of the coil, and replace
the metallic contacts by a mercury break, we shall hardly
                                     i.
succeed in bringing to bear on unit surface in a tube 10 times
as wide, and consequently of 100 times the section, so much
electricity that the same change would take place.      This only
takes  place when we   employ            jars; and then the con
ditions become so complicated that their discussion has hitherto
been impossible.
   Wüllner”, from a series of careful experiments, has urged
objections against the above view of the origin of spectra, and
has employed the spectrum of nitrogen as his starting-point.
As he had not these separate measurements of the influence
of the thickness of the layer, of the intensity of the discharges,
of the pressure, and of the quantity of energy given off, it is
not possible to follow the discussion of his experiments into
details.   The appearance of single nitrogen-lines together with
the bands may be explained by the reasons given above.         An
objection formerly raised by me against Wüllner's theory has
been set aside by recent experiments of Dewar and Scottf.
But that with hydrogen a change of line spectrum into band
spectrum cannot be brought about by change of the thickness
of the radiating layer may be seen from the remark of Lockyer,
that a layer of incandescent hydrogen only a fraction of a
millimetre thick in a Geissler's tube shows the same bright
lines as the layer in the sun's photosphere thousands of
kilometres in thickness. Moreover the gases would have to
possess an enormous absorption-coefficient for the luminous
rays corresponding to the bands, whereas exactly the opposite
follows from the experiments of Gouyi.         Moreover Wüllner
has always taken the change of temperature into account.
   My next problem will be to examine further the region
sketched out in this research—namely, to determine the rela
tion between the intensity of the separate lines of the spectrum,
the quantities of electricity, and the quantities of energy given

sarily perpendicular to this surface.            When the lines of force
and the equipotential surfaces are straight, parallel, and equi
distant, we have a uniform field. The intensity of the field is
shown by the number of lines passing through unit area, and
the rate of variation of potential by the number of equipoten
tial surfaces cutting unit length of each line of force.                Hence
the distances     separating    the  equipotential     surfaces are a mea

   In measuring an E.M.F. by this instrument, it is important
that the potential of the jar or the guard-ring or disk should
be kept constant during the experiment.              It was observed,
however, that the jar was losing                                 its
                                                charge, though very

    (B)   Absolute                Measurement of the E.M.F.
                       Electromagnetic
    This measurement    was made by determining the strength
of the current given by the E.M.F. by means of a tangent
  alvanometer, and then measuring the resistance of the circuit
in the way to be described presently.
   The tangent-galvanometer employed consists of a circular
coil, of mean radius 18.2 centims., containing 400 turns, in
 19 layers, of insulated copper wire, the breadth and the depth
of the coil being 2 and 1.3 centims. respectively. The needle
of the galvanometer consists of a magnet only about      centim.
long, made of hard-tempered steel wire, and suspended in the
centre of the coil by a single silk fibre.     To the needle is
attached a very fine straight glass fibre, of such a length that
its ends travel round a graduated dial of radius a little less
than that of the coil, thus serving for taking readings.
    The mathematical theory shows that, in                             a   tangent-galvano

quantity as long as E is kept constant; which furnishes this
important suggestion—that by varying the resistance R we
vary 2, and thus get many values very nearly equal, if not
equal, of the product R tan a, the mean of which would be the

therefore, was performed as follows:—The current from the
gravity-cell was passed through the tangent-galvanometer
and a variable resistance r, and the deflection a was
The object of introducing the variable resistance is (1) to
enable us to alter the resistance R, and (2) to obtain the de
flection giving minimum error, which is 45°.
    (b) To determine R(=g +b+r). The resistance g of the gal
vanometer was measured by the Wheatstone's-bridge method,
and was equal to 30-86 ohms.      The resistance b of the battery
was measured by measuring the deflections produced on the
scale of Sir William Thomson's quadrant-electrometer by con
necting the electrodes of the cell to those of the electrometer,
first Wi.   the cell was unshunted, and secondly when it was
shunted by a known resistance.      The resistance b in this case
is equal to the product of the difference of the two readings
into the shunt, divided by the second reading.     It was exactly
equal to 2:02 ohms.      The  corresponding   values of a, r, R, so
obtained, were as follows:—

   The fact, therefore, that Joule's value of    obtained by this
method is too    large  (assnming  his water-friction value to be
correct), points to the conclusion that the ohm is really smaller
than it was intended to be, in accordance with the results of
Rowland" and Lorenzf, and in direct contradiction to that of
Kohlrausch.     As the erroneous statement of Dr. Wright has

LII.   On Action at a Distance.     By WALTER R. BROWNE,

                     paper is partly historical, partly critical.
                         is called “Action at a Distance,”

the statement is frequently made that Newton was of opinion
that “nobody who possessed a competent faculty of thinking”
could possibly imagine such a                  to exist. The writer
wishes, first, to show historically that this is by no means an
accurate representation of Newton's views, and, secondly, to
consider critically whether the repudiation of “action at a dis
tance,” which is now certainly common,                            is,
                                                      after all, justified

   Now, in speaking of this passage, it is usual to quote the
first of these sentences only, and omit the second ; and yet
it is obvious that the second is intended to explain and define
the sense of the first. Read by the light of the second, it
seems perfectly clear that         which      denied   allthe first     the

was the coarse materialism         Democritus and Lucretius, which
                                                       of

    (4) The last-mentioned difficulty leads          another, viz.                   to                              to   fix
the relations between the gravity-gas, and the luminiferous
ather. They cannot            the same; for Mr. Tolver Preston and

of a wave in             such a gas           =        x the velocity of the gas-par
 ticles. Since the velocity of waves in the aether is about
 180,000 miles per second, this would give the velocity of the
 particles themselves = about 130,000 miles per second—a
 velocity immensely below what is required to account for the
 fact of non-resistance. But if the aether and the gravity-gas
be different bodies, the particles of the latter must be colliding
 continually with those of the former, as they collide with the
molecules of ordinary matter.        How is it that no effects due
to such collisions are observed 2 It would seem likely that
they would assume the shape of a diffused glow of light and
heat, growing more and more intense as the translatory motion
of the gravity-particles was turned into vibratory motion of
the aether-particles.    It is needless to say that nothing in the
least  resembling  this takes place.
    We will here leave the discussion of Le Sage's impact theory,
as explaining the particular case of gravitation, and go on to
inquire how the same, or any other impact theory, can explain
some other phenomena of the universe.            We will first take
those      of cohesion.

cannot keep the bar together; if they are, they cannot be
compressed.        Again, if the molecules are spherical, or of any
other   regular   shape   whatever, they cannot oppose any resist
ance to   separation,   i. e. there can be no tensional stress. The
only way out of this seems to be to conceive them shaped some
thing like burrs, and holding on to each other by hooks. This
is altogether contrary to the vortex-atom and                  other known        all
theories of molecules. Moreover such burr-like molecules must
hold   to each other somewhat loosely; and              certain amount a                                 of

    The above trains of reasoning are not long, and rest on un
doubted facts; and the writer has not been able to discover
any flaw in them.         But unless some such flaw, and a fatal
one, be discovered, it must be held to be demonstrated that
the phenomena of cohesion cannot be explained except on the
hypothesis of action at a distance.
   Magnetism.—Of the many difficult cases presented by the
phenomena of electricity, it will be sufficient to cite one of
the simplest.      When an ordinary iron magnet is brought
near a piece of iron, the latter is attracted to                   Now the                it.

are not     incontact; and the second, because the effect             one                        is        of
attraction, not      repulsion. Thus the only possible explanation

of  this fact, apart from action             distance,   at   a  supposing           is    by

is not so clear.    In conclusion it may be asked, therefore,
what real reason is there why this hypothesis of action at a
distance should not be admitted. To some minds it seems to
present itself in the light of a theory which it is a priori diffi
cult, if not impossible, to believe. But Physics has nothing to
do with mental impressions; and in the history of the Induc
tive Sciences there are many well-known instances, where
a priori notions of this kind have seriously hindered the ad
vance of knowledge.       It is evident that the progress of science
in any direction must be towards certain universal and final
 facts, beyond which she cannot go.          On the one theory, the
 ultimate fact in the case of      gravity  is enunciated in a ve
 simple law of force, connecting together         ponderable bodies.           all
 On the other theory, the ultimate facts are apparently enun

with a Note on the so-called Serpentine of Porthdinlleyn (Caernarvon
shire).”    By Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., Sec. G.S.
    Several patches of serpentine are indicated on the Geological
Survey map on the western side of Anglesey, near Tre-Walley
 station, and a considerable one on Holyhead island near Rhoscolyn.
These really include three very distinct varieties of rocks—(1) com
 pact green schistose rocks, (2) gabbro, (3) true serpentine. The
 author described the mode of occurrence of each of these, and their
relations, the serpentine being almost certainly intrusive in the
 schist, and the gabbro in the serpentine. The microscopic structure
of the various rocks was described in detail, especially of the last.
 It presents the usual characteristics, and is an altered olivine rock
which has contained bronzite.         One or two varieties are rather
peculiar; an ophicalcite and a compact chloritic schist containing
chromite are also noticed. At Porthdinlleyn there is no serpentine,
but an interesting series of agglomerates and (probably) lava-flows
 of a basic nature, which may now be denominated diabases.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On Abnormal Geological Deposits in the Bristol District.”
By Charles Moore, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author remarked that the Frome district shows numerous
unconformable Secondary deposits and “vein-fissures” resting upon
or passing down through the Carboniferous Limestone, as described
in his former paper (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxiii. p. 449).
He gave some further particulars as to these deposits, and especially
described the occurrence of Postpliocene, Liassic, and Rhaetic
deposits in the Microlestes-quarry near Shepton-Mallet.        Here the

448                         Geological Society.
lower part of a fissure is filled with a brown marl containing
crystals of carbonate of lime and numerous remains of Arvicolae,
Frogs, Birds, and Fishes. The jaws of Arvicola were very abundant.
    He then proceeded to describe the occurrence of similar phe
nomena in the Bristol area, as at Durdham and Clifton Downs, in
the gorge of the Avon at Clifton, at Ashton and Westbury-on-Trym,
in the Yate rock, in Nettlebury quarry, at Clevedon, and on the
Thornbury railway.      He noticed the occurrence in the infillings of
fissures  traversing the Carboniferous Limestone of these localities of
fossil remains belonging to various geological ages; and he especially
called attention to the presence in different deposits of an immense
number of small tubular bodies of doubtful origin, for which, should
they prove to be of organic nature, he proposed the name of Tubu
lella ambigua.     By different authorities these little bodies have
been assimilated to Serpulac (Filograma), insect-tubes, and the casts
of the fine roots of plants. With regard to the age of the fissure
deposits, the author remarked that although in some fissures the
infilling shows a mixture of organisms, in most cases each “vein "
appears to have an individuality of its own, and thus the veins
represent intervals of geological time clearly distinct from one
another, different fissures showing infillings of Alluvium, Oolite,
Lias, Rhaetic, and Keuper beds. The presence of his Tubulella he
 considered to indicate freshwater conditions.
    The author also referred to the discovery of Thecodontosaurus and
Palaeosaurus many years ago at the edge of Durdham Down, and
 discussed the age of the deposit containing them, which was
 originally supposed to be Permian, and was referred by Mr.
Etheridge to the Dolomitic Conglomerate at the base of the Keuper.
The author stated that he had found remains of the same genera in
 Rhaetic deposits at Holwell and Clifton Down, and had hence been
led to refer the two genera to that age. He stated, however, that
he had since discovered teeth of Thecodontosaurus        identical with
those of the Bristol area in a deposit belonging to the middle of the
 Upper Keuper at Ruishton near Taunton, and recognized certain
 differences between these teeth and those of the same genus from
 the Rhaetic beds of Holwell; hence he was led to give up the
notion that the former were of Rhaetic age, and to refer them to the
 Upper Keuper; but he remarked upon the interesting fact that,
while most of the generic forms of the Keuper are represented in
 the Rhaetic, the species differ.
    2. “Interglacial Deposits of West Cumberland and North Lan
cashire.” By J. D. Kendall, Esq., C.E., F.G.S.
    The glacial deposits of the district consist of an Upper and a
Lower Boulder-clay, with an intercalated group of sand, gravel, and
 clay, the three being rarely present in one section.    These deposits
occur    fairly continuously  up  to 500 feet above the sea, and in
patches up to 1000 feet.       Associated with these glacial beds are
 deposits of vegetable matter, which, when occurring on the sea
 shore, have been designated submerged forests.       The author con
siders this designation incorrect.    The results of a large number of

                      Intelligence and Miscellaneous                            Articles.                    449
borings at Lindal, in Furness, are given, in which, beneath Upper
Boulder-clay, one of these vegetable deposits was pierced, resting on
Boulder-clays or sand.        Similar deposits (which have been less
completely examined) occur at Crossgates, Walney Island, and Drigg.
Another is near St. Bees, which has been more minutely examined;
and yet another near Maryport.         These deposits are not, like the
Lindal  beds, clearly interglacial, but, being compact and in other ways
differing from the ordinary peaty deposits, are believed by the author
to be so; further, they all rest on Lower Boulder-clay.
   The author believes that the vegetable matter was not produced
in situ, but accumulated under water.         Rootstocks certainly occur
in position of growth ; but their roots do not pass down into the
underlying Boulder-clay; so they may have floated into this position.
The author considers this to throw light on the formation of coal.

 these mountain chains, we have first granite; and this is flanked by
  Subcarboniferous limestone, in most places so crystalline as to
  obliterate all traces of fossils.         Protruding through these, and
  forming the mountain-peaks, we have porphyry, quartzites, basalt,
   diorites, and trachytes.
      The country rock in the immediate vicinity of the antimony
  mines is quartzite and limestone. The lodes are from four to
  twenty feet wide; and exploitation work, carried to a depth of
  thirty feet, shows that the fissures are filled from wall to wall with
  the oxide of antimony, almost pure and remarkably uniform in
  character. The course of the lodes is nearly north and south ;
  the pitch is high to the east.       The area over which the ore is found
  may be roughly stated to be five or six miles long and half a mile
  or more wide.
      The Boston Company controls nine mines, each of which is a
  full Mexican claim, 800 metres (2624 feet 8 inches) long and 200
  metres (656 feet 2 inches) wide.          On three of the mines the crop,
 which is solid oxide of          antimony,    stands up boldly above the
 general surface, and may be traced along the claims for many
  hundred feet.       As stated above, the ore, so far as explorations

angle. This amounts to 90° when self-induction is neglected; it
is more than 90°, reckoned in the direction of the rotation, when
the self-induction becomes sensible. The magnitude of this appa
rent rotation depends, when the hollow spheres are thin, in a very
simple manner, on the velocity of rotation; so that thin hollow
spheres are especially suited for experimental investigations. With
hollow spheres of finite thickness the rotation is different for the
different layers: the inner precede the outer; their rotation is
bound to no limit, and increases to infinity when the velocity of
rotation increases infinitely.      The rotation of the outermost layer
converges towards a fixed value. The intensity increases at the
commencement with the rotation-velocity, but nowhere so rapidly
as the latter; at greater velocities of rotation it diminishes again in
the inner layers. With infinitely increasing rotation-velocities the
intensity vanishes in the inner layers, and the entire phenomenon
is condensed at the boundary of the sphere. The current that takes
place here protects the interior from the external influence, apart
from certain limitations.
    The proof and the exact calculation of this course of the pheno
menon forms the body of the investigation, to which are appended
the following results:—
    (1) If the self-induction be neglected, the total-current function
can be represented in a closed form by the outer potential without
any resolution of the latter according to spherical functions being
necessary.
    (2) Plane infinite disks are treated as portions of infinite hollow
spheres. For these, taking account of the self-induction, develop
ments are given which make the solution of the outer potential
superfluous.
    (3) The magnetic potential of the induced current, and the heat
 generated by        are calculated, from which results the work requi
