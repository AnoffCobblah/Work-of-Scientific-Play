 I. Effects of Temperature on the Magnetic Properties of Iron
     and Alloys of Iron. By R. L. Wills, A.R.C.Sc.I., 1851
     Exhibition Scholar, St. Johns College, Cambridge *.
 THE experiments of Baur f, Hopkinson J, Morris §, and
         others on the effects of temperature on the magnetic
 quality of iron show that as the temperature is raised the
 magnetization for small magnetizing forces increases, at first
 gradually, but beyond a temperature of about 600° 0. the
 permeability increases very rapidly until the critical tem
perature is approached, when the magnetization suddenly
 disappears.
     The maximum permeability obtained by Hopkinson was
about 11,000 with a magnetizing force of 0"iJ C.G.S. at a
temperature of 775° C. The rise in permeability is less and
less as the magnetic force is increased ; with a force of
4 c.G.s. the permeability remains practically constant as the
temperature is raised till about 700° C. is reached, then the
permeability falls, but much more gradually than with lower
magnetizing forces.
    To explain these results Professor Ewing || has applied a
modification of Weber's molecular theory, in which the con
straint of the molecules is supposed due to their mutual
action as magnets.

2          Mr. 11. L. Wills on the Effects of Temperature
    The magnetizing process, according to Weber's theory,
consists in turning the molecular magnets so that the mag
netic axis of each is in the same direction a< the applied
magnetizing force. When the force is weak the molecules
will be but slightly deflected ; as the forc3 is increased the
molecules are brought more nearly into alignment till, with
a very strong force, they are all parallel with the field and
the specimen is saturated.
    Prof. Ewing* divides the magnetizing process of magnetic
metals into three stages. During the first stage the perme
ability is small and there is practically no retentiveness. In
the second stage the curve of magnetization rises rapidly and
the permeability is high. In the third stage the permeability
 decreases and the specimen approaches saturation.
     The effect of heat is regarded as making the transition
 from one stage of the magnetizing process to another occur
 at lower values of the magnetic force. Heating expands the
 structure and weakens the mutual forces between the mole
 cular magnets, thus enabling the applied magnetizing force
 to have a greater effect in turning the molecules. Oscilla
 tions are supposed to be set up as the temperature rises which
 oppose the alignment of the magnets, and by supposing the
 oscillations to become so violent that the magnets eventually
 rotate, the disappearance of magnetism at the critical tempe
 rature would be accounted for.
     The temperature effect appears to have been studied only
 for magnetizing forces so large that the heat applied has
 brought on the second stage of the magnetizing process, and
 before the magnetic quality disappears the third stage has
 even been entered upon. From this it would appear that by
 using successively smaller magnetizing forces, so that less of
  the third stage is brought on before the critical condition is
 reached, the permeability will rise more rapidly with the
 temperature, and with a suitable relation of force to tempe
  rature the permeability will be the maximum obtainable.
  With lower magnetizing forces than this critical value the
  temperature required to bring on the second stage will be
  higher, and only a part of this stage is brought on before
  the critical temperature is reached and magnetic quality lost.
  As the magnetizing force is further reduced the maximum
  permeability obtained in each case decreases, and in ex
  tremely weak fields it appears quite possible that the critical
  temperature is reached before even the second sta«-e is
  brought on.

properties of certain alloys of iron, which, at the ordinary
temperature, had been previously found to give very different
magnetic results when in different physical conditions.
   It appeared desirable to examine the effect of heat on the
magnetic properties of wrought iron in weak fields, to see
when, as the temperature is raised, the successive stages of
the magnetizing process are brought on, and to obtain some
idea as to the rate of transition from stage to stage.
   The specimens were obtained from Messrs. Brunton & Son,
of Musselburgh, and were in the form of rings turned out of
solid blocks and annealed. The magnetization was measured
ballistically by reversing the magnetizing force, the arrange
ment of the apparatus being very similar lo that used by
Ewing and Klaassen*.
   The copper wire was insulated with asbestos paper, and thin
asbestos tape laid between the primary and secondary coils.
   The temperatures were estimated by the resistances of the
secondary coil and a platinum wire ; it was found that after
successive heating and cooling the resistance of the secondary
coil increased, at first very slightly, but after a time the
increase was proportionately large. A platinum wire was
wound around the ring between the primary and secondary
coils and its resistance measured as well as the resistance of
the secondary at each temperature.
   The specimens were heated in a Fletcher's improved
muffle furnace, and the temperature regulated by the
supply of gas. Before each experiment sufficient time was
allowed to get the temperature steady, and it was found that
in each case the temperature remained constant within 3°C.
during each set of readings.

  additional resistance in the secondary circuit was 9*334.
      The specimen was first demagnetized by reversals of
  current, by passing currents successively diminishing in
  amount to zero and rapidly alternating in direction through
  the primary, any initial magnetism the ring may have
  possessed was thus got rid of.
      Magnetizing currents were next passed through the primary
  circuit while the ring was at the ordinary temperature of the

      The passage from one stage of the magnetizing process to
  another is gradual, taking place through a definite range of
  magnetic force. Nagaoka* has shown for nickel that the
  passages from stage to stage can be made much more abrupt
  by applying torsion with a longitudinal pull.
      For the present purpose it will be more convenient to
  represent the results of experiment by plotting permeability
  as ordinates instead of induction, showing the relation between
  permeability and magnetic force.
      Fig. 1 represents the curve thus obtained from the data
  given above. The permeability reaches a maximum with a
  magnetizing force of about 2 C.G.s., and when the third stage
  of the magnetizing process is entered upon the permeability
  falls very rapidly.

each case, we may obtain some idea as to how much earlier
in the magnetizing process the successive stiiges are brought
on by heating to any temperature, and from this ascertain the
rate of transition from stage to stage as the temperature
is raised.
   The ring was next very slowly heated and the following
results obtained with a constant magnetizing force of
645 c.g.s. :—

   It will be seen the induction remains practically constant
as the ring is heated until the temperature reaches about
400° C. ; then the induction falls, at first slowly, but more
rapidly when a temperature of about 700° C. is passed, and
the specimen becomes practically non-magnetic at about
776° C. The ring was heated slightly above the critical
temperature and a very slight movement in the galvanometer
on reversing the magnetizing current observed.
   Readings were taken at various temperatures as the gas
was lowered with the same magnetizing force ; the magnetic
quality returns as rapidly as it disappeared, but at a slightly
lower temperature.

     u"      Mr. R. L. Wills on the Effects of Temperature
        Various magnetizing forces were afterwards used and curves
    plotted showing the relation between permeability and tempe
    rature corresponding to heating and cooling. In each case
    the permeability reaches the same maximum value during
    cooling as on heating, and for each magnetizing force the
     heating and cooling curves are very similar.
        The ring was afterwards examined in successive experi
     ments at different temperatures, the magnetic force was
     varied while the temperature was kept constant, and from
     these results permeability-temperature curves were drawn
     for various magnetizing forces. The curves obtained com
     pare satisfactorily with those given by Hopkinson * for cor
     responding fields.
        A few special cases will be given here to show the effect of
    heat on the permeability as the magnetizing force is varied
     between two values, tbe larger of which brings on the second
     or third stage before any heat is applied, while the smaller is
    unable to bring on the second stage before the critical tempe
    rature is reached.
        In each experiment the observations were repeated several
    times with reversed directions of magnetizing force, and after
    each experiment the ring was demagnetized by reversals as
    explained above.
        A magnetizing force of 4'3 C.G.s. gave the following values
    for the permeability at the temperatures noted : —

    It will be seen that the permeability increases slightly as
 the temperature is raised to about .500° C. ; beyond this tem
 perature the permeability falls, at first slowly, hut with great
 rapidity as the critical temperature is approached.
    The explanation given by Professor Ewing for the results
of experiment with a field-strength giving a permeability-
 temperature curve similar to fig. 2 is that heating facilitates
 the alignment of the molecular magnets by weakening their
 mutual forces, but the permeability does not rise appreciably
 owing to the influence of oscillations supposed to be set up as
 the temperature rises which oppose the alignment of the
magnets. This latter effect increases very rapidly as the
critical point is approached and the permeability falls.
   With fairly strong fields, such that the third stage of the
magnetizing process is brought on before any heat is applied,
there is no appreciable increase in permeability as the tempe
rature rises, and the change from the magnetic to the non
magnetic state takes place comparatively gradually.
   The curves drawn for successively smaller magnetizing
 forces show that as the force is reduced the temperature at
which the permeability begins to fall increases. This may be
accounted for by the molecular magnets being less deflected
under weaker forces, and consequently the temperature
necessary to bring them parallel with the field will be
higher.
   It is seen from fig. 1 that the permeability decreases very
rapidly as the field is increased beyond the second stage;
consequently, by reducing the magnetic force so that less of
the third stage is entered upon before the magnetic quality is
lost, heating is more favourable to magnetization.
   The following values for the permeability at the tempera
tures given were obtained with a force of l'OTS C.G.S., and are
shown plotted in fig. 3.

   In this case the second stage is just entered upon before
any heat is applied, the permeability consequently increases
as shown immediately tho temperature is raised. At about
650° C. the prejudicial effect of temperature becomes stronger
and the permeability falls.
   With a magnetizing force of 0'G88 C.G.s. the result*
were : —

   As the magnetizing force is reduced the increase in per
meability during the earlier stages of heating gets less ; but
at the higher temperatures the permeability increases more
rapidly, and the change from the magnetic to the non-mag
netic state becomes more and more abrupt. This is because less
of the third stage of the magnetizing process is entered upon
before the critical temperature is reached ; and consequently
the rate of increase of permeability at high temperatures will
be greater.
   Reducing the magnetizing force still more, the maximum
permeability obtained in each case and the temperature at
which it occurs increase, until with a force of 0" 172 C.G.s.
the maximum permeability is practically 17,000 at a tempe
rature of about 750° 0.
   The values of the permeability at different temperatures
with this magnetizing force were:—

shown graphically in fig. 4.
   Corresponding curves were drawn for lower magnetizing
forces. The temperature at which the rapid rise in per
meability begins increases as the magnetic force is reduced, and
the maximum permeability obtained in each case diminishes.
This is just what we should expect, seeing that with weaker
fields the temperature necessary to bring on the second stage
is higher, and therefore less of this stage is entered upon
before the critical temperature is reached.

    With still weaker fields the kicks in the galvanometer on
reversing the magnetizing currents were very small, and the cal
culated permeability could not be relied upon with any degree
of accuracy; but from the observations taken with a magnetic
force as low as 0"009 C.G.s. the permeability was found to
increase rapidly as a temperature of 770° C. was approached,
from which it would appear that even with this very weak
 field the second stage is brought on before the critical
temperature is reached.
    If the effect of heat in hastening the transition from stage
to stage is uniform—that is, proportional to the temperature—
there will be no sudden increase in the permeability as the
temperature is raised until the second stage is entered upon;
but if the rate of transition increases with the temperature, a
considerable augmentation of susceptibility can be thus
accounted for without assuming that the second stage is
brought on.
    Figs. 2, 3, and 4 are given to show the relation between
 permeability and temperature under magnetic forces which
 bring on the respective stages of the magnetizing process
 before any heat is applied. It will be seen (fig. 2) that with
 a fairly strong field the permeability is only slightly affected

 10      Mr. R. L. Wills on the Effects of Temperature
 until the temperature is rather high, owing to the gradient of
 the curve of magnetization in the third stage being small.
 With a field slightly above 1 c.G.s. the second stage is just
 entered upon while the metal is cold, and a small increase in
 the strength of the field makes a very considerable increase in
 the permeability. In this case the first effect of heating is
 to bring on more of the second stage; consequently the per
 meability rises as in fig. 3. In the first stage the gradient of
 the curve of magnetization is again small ; and therefore with
 weak fields the permeability increases but slightly throughout
 a wide range of temperature as in the case of a moderately
 strong field.

   Fig. 5 is drawn to show the maximum permeability and
the temperature at which it occurs for different magnetizing
forces. In this figure the ordinates to the curves marked A
and B represent the magnetizing force and maximum per
meability respectively, and the abscissae the temperature at
which the permeability begins to fall.
   To make this clear, let us consider the case of a magnetic
force of 1 C.G.s. represented by RQ, the maximum permea
bility obtained with this field is given by the ordinate PQ,
and is reached at a temperature represented by OQ. The
scales of magnetic force and permeability are given on the
right and left of the figure respectively.
   We have seen that the successive stages of the magnetizing
process are brought on with values of the magnetic force

depending upon the temperature; with very weak fields the
second stage is not reached until the temperature is between
600° C. and 700° C, and then the permeability increases with
great rapidity. Under a magnetizing force of such a strength
that the second stage is just entered upon while the metal is
cold, the rate of increase in permeability as the temperature
is raised is comparatively slow. From this it appears that
the effect of heat in hastening the transition from stage to
stage is greater at high than at low temperatures.
   Curves showing the relation between permeability and
magnetic force, at different temperatures, were drawn with a
view to ascertain the rate of transition as the temperature is
raised.
   Table I. (p. 12) gives the results obtained while the
temperature was kept as nearly constant as was practicable
during each set of readings.
   These results are shown graphically in fig. 6; the scale of
magnetic force is different for each curve, being regulated so
that the maximum permeability occurs at the same distance
along the horizontal axis in each case. The ordinates for the
curves are drawn to the same scale except for a temperature
of 735° C. : in this case the scale is reduced to $ for con
venience in plotting. It will be seen from the figure that
the curves are very similar to one another, and it will be
 found on reducing the ordinates in a suitable ratio for each
temperature that the curves practically coincide.
    The experiments were repeated several times, it being found
that the kicks in the galvanometer with extremely small forces
giving the first stage of the magnetizing process for the
higher temperatures were in some experiments slightly larger
than those from which the permeabilities given were calculated.
This was attributed to the demagnetizing process not entirely
wiping out all the effects of previous magnetism, the residual
 effect being noticeable only at high temperatures. In each
 case, however, as the second stage was entered upon, tie
 corresponding kicks in each series of readings for the same
 temperature were practically identical.
    Representing the results of experiment as in the figure, we
 see clearly that the effect of heating is to bring on the suc
 cessive stages of the magnetizing process with values of the
 magnetic force depending upon the temperature.
    The relation between temperature and magnetizing force
 in hastening the transition from stage to stage may be ascer
 tained by observing the force necessary to bring on any-
 definite point in the process of magnetization for different
 temperatures. For this purpose the point at which the

 maximum permeability occurs has been taken, and the results
 shown graphically in fig. 7, where the ordinates to the curve
 measure the magnetizing forces giving the maximum permea
 bility and the abscissae the corresponding temperatures.
    The curve in the figure gives a measure of haw much
earlier in the magnetizing process the successive stages are
 brought on by heating to any temperature; and it will be
seen that the rate of transition from stage to stage increases
with the temperature.

    It has been shown above that the rise in permeability as
the second stage is entered upon becomes more rapid as the
magnetizing force is reduced ; under a force of 1"075 C.G.S.
(fig. 3) the permeability increases comparatively gradually
as the temperature is raised ; while with a force of 0-172 C.G.s.
(fig. 4) the permeability rises very rapidly when the second
stage is brought on. This is explained by the rate of tran
sition from stage to stage being much greater at high than at
low temperatures ; in the former case the second stage is just
entered upon while the ring is cold, while under the smaller
magnetizing force the temperature necessary to bring on this
stage is about 650° C.
                         Tungsten Alloy.
    In the case of iron and highly permeable substances the
first and second stages of the magnetizing process extend
over a comparatively small range of magnetic force, and the
passage from one stage to the other at high temperatures

       ran only be examined under extremely weak fields. This
       introduces a large percentage of possible error in estimating
       the permeability, the kicks in the galvanometer being very
       small.
           It was thought that the effect of temperature in hastening
       the transition from stage to stage could be more satisfactorily
       examined in the case of alloys of iron giving a magnetization-
       curve the successive stages of which extend over a greater
       range of magnetic force.
           Various investigations on the influence of elements on the
       magnetic properties of iron have shown that the presence of
       tungsten or chromium considerably lessens the permeability,
       the second stage of the magnetizing process not being entered
       upon until the magnetic force is fairly high.
           Experiments of the same nature as those described above
       were made on an alloy containing 4*5 per cent, tungsten.
       The dimensions of the ring were as shown : —

           These results are shown plotted in fig. 8, together with
       the curve for the specimen of wrought iron described above.
           It will be seen from the figure that for the tungsten alloy
        the permeability does not increase appreciably until the field
       is increased beyond about 7 C.G.S., and the point in the
        second stage of the magnetizing process giving the maximum
        permeability is only brought on when the field has reached a
        value of about 15 c.G.s,

the observations repeated several times with reversed direction
of magnetizing currents. For most of the temperatures
given the whole set of readings were repeated.
   It has been mentioned above that the process of " demag
netizing by reversals " does not appear entirely to wipe out
all the effects of previous magnetization, although the effect
of residual magnetism is noticeable under extremely small
magnetic forces only at very high temperatures when the
metal is in a critical state. With the tungsten alloy this
residual effect could not be detected, even at the highest
temperature.

magnetic forces are much higher in the case of the tungsten
alloy.
   The curves given in the figure show more clearly than was
possible with iron the effect of heat in hastening the transition
from stage to stage of the magnetizing process. Under a
magnetic force of about 15 C.G.S. the third stage is just
entered upon at the ordinary temperature, and heating has
very little effect on the permeability until a temperature
of about 550° C. is passed, then the permeability falls.
   It will be seen that, unlike the case for iron, the rate of
increase in permeability as the second stage is brought on
is practically the same for all magnetizing forces. This
appears to indicate that the rate of transition from one to the
other is independent of the temperature, because under a
force of 8-156 c.g.s. the second stage is brought on at a
comparatively low temperature, and as the force is reduced
the temperature necessary to bring on this stage increases.
   The maximum permeability obtained in each case, and the
temperature at which it occurs, increases as the magnetic
force is reduced, until the permeability reaches a value of
about 2200 at a temperature of (550° 0. with a force of about
2*04 C.g.s. On reducing the magnetizing force below this value,
the maximum permeability obtained in each case decreases.

    18        Mr. R. L. Wills on tlie Effects of Temperature
       The following results were obtained with a magnetic force
    of about 0-4 C.G.s. : —

       It was found, however, just as in the case of iron, that the
    permeability increases considerably as the temperature be
    comes rather high, even under extremely small magnetic
    forces.
        Observations were taken at different temperatures as the
    ring was cooled ; the magnetic quality returned as rapidly
     as it disappeared when the temperature had fallen about
     20° C. below the critical temperature, and for each mag
     netizing force the curves showing the relation between
     permeability and temperature corresponding to heating and
     cooling were found to be very similar to one another.
       Fig. 10 (p. 20) gives the permeability-magnetic force curves
     for different temperatures plotted from the data given in
     Table II., the scale of ordinates being the same for each curve ;
     but the scale of abscissae in each case is regulated so that
     the point of maximum permeability occurs at the same distance
     along the horizontal axis.

   In the case of iron (fig. (i) it was seen that the curves
corresponding to different temperatures could be made to
practically coincide by plotting to suitable scales; this is not
the case with the tungsten alloy.
   It will be seen from fig. 10 that heating has a much greater
effect on the permeability during the first part of the process
of magnetization than it has under stronger magnetic forces.
The initial permeability when the metal is cold is slightly
above 100, while at a temperature of 1)5.5° C. it is 1020; the
maximum permeabilities obtained at the same temperatures
were about G50 and 21-40 respectively.

   The figure also shows that at a temperature as high as
G49° C. the permeability remains practically constant until
the magnetic force is increased beyond about 0"4 c.G.s.
   At a temperature of 655° C, when the metal is just about
to enter the critical condition, the values of the permeability
for different magnetizing forces were:—
Mag. Force ...0083 0 33 065 098         147    179 245 326 4-89 6-52
Permeability... 1026 1020 1134 1353 1985 2141 2044 1645 1188 922
   This shows that the second stage of the magnetizing pro*
cess is not brought on until the magnetic force is about
0"4 C.G.s. With weaker fields than this the effect of
temperature in hastening the transition from one stage to the
other is unable to bring on the second stage before the
critical condition is reached and the magnetic quality lost.
   The values of the permeability at different temperatures for
a magnetic force of about 04 C.G s. are given above, from
which it will be seen that the permeability increases more than
ninefold, although the second stage is not entered upon.

22        Mr. R. L. Wills on the Effects of Temperature
                            Aluminium Alloy.
   Investigations on the magnetic behaviour of alloys of iron
have shown that the influence of aluminium is of an entirely
different nature to that of most other elements.
    Perhaps the most striking difference is seen between the
effects of chromium or tungsten and aluminium.
   The effect on the magnetic properties of iron of adding
even a small percentage of tungsten is to increase considerably
both the retentivity and coercive force, while the addition of
a small percentage of aluminium has just the opposite effect.
The maximum magnetization in each case is fairly high, but
the permeability for the tungsten alloy is very small, while
for the aluminium alloy it compares very favourably with
that of the best iron.
   From these considerations it appeared desirable to inves
tigate the effect of heat on the magnetic properties of an
aluminium alloy.
    Richardson* has examined the effect of temperature on
certain aluminium alloys, and drawn curves showing the
change in induction with rise of temperature for different
magnetizing forces.
   The results of experiment given for an alloy containing
3*64 per cent, aluminium show that at the ordinary tem
perature the permeability is low, and, upon heating, the
induction increases, reaching a maximum at a temperature of
about 380° C; the permeability decreases with rise of tem
perature near the critical point until a minimum value is
reached, when further heating but slightly affects the
permeability.
    Other investigations t on the influence of elements on the
 magnetic properties of iron have shown that the addition of
between 2 per cent, and 3 per cent, of aluminium has very
little effect on the maximum induction, and that the per
meability for low magnetizing forces is even higher than
that of a good specimen of iron. It is also shown that when
the percentage of aluminium is increased to 5"5 per cent, the
maximum induction is fairly high, and the permeability for
weak forces only slightly affected.
    Experiments similar to those described above wrere made on
an aluminium alloy of the follow ing composition. The analysis

         The values of the induction for different magnetic forces
     were first obtained at the ordinary temperature of the room,

         The susceptibility with respect to magnetic forces below
      about 1"2 C.G.s. is even greater than in the case of the iron
      specimen described above *. The second stage of the mag
      netizing process is brought on when the field is about
      0"8 C.G.S. , and the maximum permeability obtained with a
     force of about 2 C.G.s., while for iron the corresponding
     values of the magnetic force were shown to be about 1 c.G.s.
     and 2-2 c.o.s. respectively.
         The ring was examined in successive experiments while
      the temperature was kept constant, and after each experiment
      demagnetized by reversals.
         The values for the permeability in terms of magnetic
      force for different temperatures are given in Table III.
        * The absence of this remarkable magnetic quality of aluminium steels
      in the alloy referred to above containing 3'64 per cent, aluminium
      is apparently due to the influence of the large percentage of other
      elements present. The effect of any particular element on the magnetic
      properties of iron varies very considerably according to the other
      elements present and the percentage of these elements.

                 on the Magnetic Properties of Iron.              27
    These results are shown graphically in figs. 12 and 13: the
scale of magnetic force for each curve is so chosen that the
point giving the maximum permeability in each case occurs
at the same distance along the horizontal axis.
    It has been seen from the corresponding curves for each of
the preceding specimens that the permeability at any stage of
the process of magnetization has, in a general way, increased
with the temperature.
    This, however, is not the case with the aluminium alloy.
    Referring to fig. 12, it will be seen that for magnetic forces
above about 04 c.G.s. the specimen is much more susceptible
to magnetization at a temperature of 300° C. than it is when
the temperature has risen to 489° C.
     It is also seen that at these particular temperatures the
successive stages of the magnetizing process are brought on
with practically the same magnetic forces. This is also the
case for temperatures of 632° C. and 6t>0° C.
     Corresponding curves for higher temperatures are shown in
fig. 13.
     As the temperature is raised beyond 632° (J. the permea
bility for weak magnetic forces rapidly increases, and reaches
a value of about 17250, the maximum obtainable with a force
of about 0-125 c.G.s., at a temperature of 68(5° C.
     The values of the permeability at different temperatures
under a magnetic force of 0-127 c.G.s. were:—
Tamp in [ l5o     21go 360o  428°  489° 527°  609°  632°  660° 686°

     Plotting these results, we get a curve very similar to that
obtained for iron with the corresponding critical force of
0-172 c.G.s., shown in fig. 4 (p. 9).
     As the magnetizing force is reduced beyond this critical
value, the maximum permeability obtained in each case
decreases.
     It will be seen that the magnetic force giving the maximum
obtainable permeability for the aluminium alloy is smaller
than the corresponding force for the iron specimen.
     At a temperature of 695° C. the alloy is practically non
magnetic. It was found, however, that the effects of previous
magnetization were not entirely got rid of by heating the ring
beyond this temperature.
     Observations were taken with different magnetizing forces
as the ring cooled. The magnetic quality returns as rapidly
as it disappeared at a temperature slightly below the critical
point, and for each magnetizing force me permeability reaches
the same maximum value as that obtained during heating.

 28       Mr. R. L. Wills on the Effects of Temperature
    Representing the results of experiment given in Table III.
 by plotting permeability with respect to temperature for
 fairly strong fields, the changes in the permeability shown in
 figs. 12 and 13 are seen to take place comparatively suddenly,
 the curves showing points of maximum permeability at tem
 peratures about 400° C. and 590° C.
    The relative values of the permeability at these maximum
 points vary with the field. For magnetizing forces below
 about 1 c.G.s. the maximum permeability occurs at tempera
 tures near the critical point, as in the case of iron. Under
 forces between about 1 C.G.S. and 2"6 C.G.S. the maximum
 permeability occurs at the higher maximum point, that is, at
about 590° C, and with magnetizing forces above 2"6 C.G.S.
 the maximum permeability is reached at about 400° (J.
    This lower maximum point agrees very closely with that
found by Richardson*.
                       5 per cent. Nickel Alloy. •
   Various investigations have shown that steels containing
certain percentages of nickel possess remarkable physical
properties. Hopkinson f investigated the effect of tempe
rature on the maguetic properties of a steel containing
5 per cent, nickel, and gave curves showing the change in
induction with respect to temperature for different magnetizing
forces. At the ordinary temperature of the room the maxi
mum magnetization of this specimen was greater than that
of wrought iron.
   Experiments of the same nature as those described above
were made on a steel containing about 5 per cent, nickel to
see the effect of temperature on the permeability in each of
the stages of the magnetizing process, and to ascertain the
relation between temperature and magnetic force in bringing
on the successive stages.

kept as constant as was possible, and the magnetic force
varied.
   Table IV. gives the values of the permeability in terms of
magnetic force for different temperatures. These results are
plotted in fig. 14, the scale of abscissae for each curve being

    With this specimen the maximum obtainable permeability
 is reached at a temperature of about 626° C. with a magnetic
 force of about 1/5 c.g.s. Increasing the temperature beyond
 this point the magnetic susceptibility decreases, until at
 about 700° C. the metal is practically non-magnetic.
    The curve for a temperature of (J37° C. is given in the
 figure, from which it will be seen that the permeability at any
 stage of the magnetizing process is less than that at the
 corresponding stage when the temperature is C>2t>° C. This
 shows that with extremely weak fields the maximum per
 meability occurs at about 626° C, and that, unlike each of
 the preceding specimens, the passage from the magnetic to
 the non-magnetic state is gradual, even under the smallest
 magnetizing force.
    It is interesting to notice that the successive stages of the
 magnetizing process are quite distinguishable, even when the
 temperature is such that the metal is passing from the
 magnetic to the non-magnetic state.
. On cooling, the magnetic quality appears at a temperature
 of about 620° C. The general form of the curves obtained
 by plotting permeability with respect to temperature for
 different magnetizing forces agrees satisfactorily with those
 given by Hopkinsou *.
    Fig. 15 is drawn to show the change in the value of the
 magnetic force giving the maximum permeability as the

                                Cr-Mn-C Alloy.
          The results of experiments made previously at the ordinary
       temperature of the atmosphere on an alloy containing fairly
       large percentages of chromium, manganese, and carbon
       showed that unannealed the specimen was practically non
      magnetic, while after heating to a temperature of about
       1000c C, and allowing to cool very slowly, it was found to
       be strongly magnetic.
          An alloy of very similar composition to the specimen
      referred to was obtained in the form of a ring, and the
      magnetic properties examined at different temperatures.
      The specimen contains about 9 per cent. Cr, 3 per cent. Mn,
      and 1 per cent. C. The dimensions of the ring were as
      shown:—
          The following results of observations of induction in terms
      of magnetic force were obtained at the ordinary temperature:—

          In this case the second stage of the magnetizing process is
      not entered upon until the magnetic force is increased beyond
      about 16 C.G.s.
          The ring was examined in successive experiments while
      the temperature was kept as nearly constant as was practic
      able, and after each experiment the specimen was demag
      netized by reversals.

     The results arc shown graphically in fig. 16, the scale of
 magnetic force for each curve being regulated so that the
 point giving the maximum permeability occurs at the same
 distance along the axis of force in each case.
     It will be seen that as the temperature increases the first
 and second stages of tho magnetizing process get less dis
 tinguishable, and when a temperature of 081° C. is reached
 there is practically no first stage at all.

36            On the Effects of Temperature on Iron.
the tungsten alloy given in fig. 10 (p. 20), we see that the effect
of temperature on the first and second stages is very similar
in each case ; but in the Cr-Mn-C alloy the effect is more
marked, the first stage entirely disappearing at high tempe
ratures. This is all the more remarkable seeing that in the
latter case the value of the magnetic force necessary to bring
on the second stage at the ordinary temperature of the room
is more than double that required in the case of the tungsten
alloy.
   The maximum permeability is obtained with a magnetizing
force of about 3"5 c.G.s. at a temperature of 681C, the
value being slightly over 820. As the temperature is raised
above 681° C. the initial permeability is increased, as in the
case of the tungsten specimen, but the maximum perme
ability obtained in each case decreases.
   At a temperature of 72(1° C. the alloy is practically non
magnetic.
   On cooling, the magnetic quality does not return until
the temperature has fallen to about 650° (.'.
   The following values of the permeability in terms of mag
netic force were obtained while the temperature fell from
645° C. to 640° C.

 magnetizing force as that given above.
     Fig. 17 shows the magnetizing force giving the maximum
 permeability at different temperatures. It will be seen that,
 as in the case of the tungsten alloy, the points lie almost on a
straight line.

   II. The Heat of Formation of Alloy?. By J. B. Tayler,
           B.Sc.(Vict.), University College, Liverpool*.
 1EXPERIMENTS have been made upon alloys of lead with
    -J tin, bismuth, and zinc., and of zinc with tin and mercury.
The method employed, which determined the choice of alloys,
consists in dissolving (a) the alloy, and (b) the corresponding
irixture of metals, in mercury, and measuring the heat of
 solution in each case. Assuming that the solutions so obtained
are identical, the difference between the heat of solution of
the mixture and that of the alloy is the heat of formation of
 the latter. The method is thus not very different in principle
from that employed by Dr. Galtf, and probably also that
employed in an as yet unpublished research by Mr. Baker
in the determination of the heat of formation of brass.
    The calorimeter used is shown in the figure. Four were
made, differing only in size and minor details. In the first
two the inner vessel (a in the figure) was of such a size that
200 grammes of mercury could be used ; the two later ones
took 500 grammes. In all cases a was a tube of thin glass
held in place in a larger and thicker tube (//) by an india-
rubber ring. The outer tube could be similarly fitted into
the bottle c. To reduce radiation the vessels were silvered,
a on the outside, h and c on the inside. The calorimeter was
closed by an indiarubber stopper which carried a email
receptacle d also of glass. An elastic band projected about
yg of an inch beyond the lower end of d, so forming a
pad against which the wooden cone h could be pressed. The
latter communicated by a stiff wire with the outside, and
could be raised or lowered at will ; when necessary, from a

38                  Mr. J. B. Tayler on the
distance. The glass stirrer could likewise be worked, and
the thermometer read, without going up to the calorimeter.
These precautions were only taken in the later experiments.
                              Fig. 1.
   The thermometer used with the first two calorimeters was
 graduated iu tenths, and could be read to hundredths of a
 degree. That used subsequently was graduated in hundredths,
 and could be read to the one-thousandth of a degree. (The
 results of the two sets of experiments can be distinguished by
 the water-value of the calorimeter.) The experiments were
 conducted in the Chemical department of the College, and no
 special precautions could be taken to keep the room at
 constant temperature ; and the thermometer was sometimes
 subjected to changes two or three times as large as the one

                    Heat of Formation of Alloys.                    39
 to bo measured, since the mercury Lad to be weighed in
 another room.
    The water-values of the calorimeters were measured experi
 mentally. This was done by running in mercury at 100° C,
 the operations being in all other respects precisely the same
as when a heat of solution was being determined. In each
case the mean of five to ten experiments was taken.
    The order of procedure was the following :—The mercury
in which the metal or alloy was to be dissolved was weighed
into the inner vessel of the calorimeter, and the thermometer
and stirrer placed in position. The alloy (or metal) was then
filed, and the filings weighed and introduced into the receiver
d. After the lapse of about a quarter of an hour the stirrer
was agitated (always by hand) and the temperature read at
short time-intervals.      Sufficient readings having been ob
tained for the radiation curve, the filings were allowed to drop
on to the mercury by lowering h, and temperature readings
were taken for the next 5 to 15 minutes. Solution was often
complete in less than a minute, and rarely took more than 2^
minutes.
   The mercury was always purified before uso by treatment
with nitric acid. One-fifth of its volume of concentrated acid
was poured on, and the mercury thoroughly agitated. The
whole was left over-night, and the crust of nitrate broken off
and removed as far as possible in the morning. The mercury
was then washed with water, dried with calcium sulphate, and
filtered through chamois leather. Moreover, each alloy and
its corresponding mixture were always dissolved in mercury
from the same batch, so th.it only the heat of solution, and
not the heat of formation, could be affected by impurities.
The metals were obtained from Kaulbaum ; but some experi
ments with commercially pure zinc showed that small quantities
of impurities did not appreciably affect the result. To make
the alloys, it was found best to melt the metal of which the
larger quantity was being used in a graphite crucible, and to
drop the other in solid. All the metals used melt at a low
temperature, and very little oxidation seems to have taken
place. When a eutectic* alloy was wanted, the fluid mass
was poured, after stirring, into a deep cylindrical mould main
tained for some time a few degrees above the melting-point
of the eutectic and then gradually cooled down. The line of
demarcation between the eutectic and the upper layer was
invariably sharp. The alloy A, in Table I., was formed by
dissolving the requisite quantity of zinc in molten lead ; B
   * This is Dr. Guthrie'a name for the alloy with the lowest melting-
point.

42                   Mr. J. B. Tay!er on the
was a truo eutectic. Of the alloys of lead and tin, those con
taining 2-0 and 5"1 per cent, of the latter were made by
adding lead to the 21 per cent, alloy ; as it was thought that
the more nearly equal the two portions melted together, the
smaller would the percentage error he. In no case was an
analysis made. In order, as far as possible, to ensure homo
geneity in the alloys, they were kept stirred until they had
nearly cooled down to the solidifying point, and were then
poured out into shallow carbon moulds. Both from their
behaviour under the file and from their heat of solution, the
alloys seem to have been homogeneous, with the exception of
the amalgam of zinc containing 2511 per cent, of that metal.
This separated into two portions, one of which was lighter
and softer than the other. The former is distinguished as at,
and the latter as /S, in the table of results.
   The alloys first experimented upon contained their con
stituents in equivalent proportions, and the heats of formation
were found to be small in comparison with those found for
brass by Dr. Gait and Mr. Baker. Since the alloys concerned
belonged to the class which Matthiessen regarded as solutions,
and since they were made at comparatively low temperatures,
it was thought that definite chemical combination had only
taken place between a small percentage of the atoms present,
and that more reliable results would be obtained by dissolving
small quantities of one metal in a large excess of others. The
heat of formation per yramme of alio;/ was found to be higher
in the cases tried; and the heat of formation of the gramme-
molecular weight of compound, supposing that the whole of
the metal present in small quantity had entered into chemical
combination by the exercise of its normal valency, was, of
course, immensely greater. The latter is the quantity it was
desired to be sure about, the object of the work being to
determine the order of magnitude of the chemical forces
which effect the combination of metals. The second column
of Table II. contains the figures calculated from those in the
first column on the above supposition.
   Incidentally it appears that the so-called " mechanical
mixtures " (so Matthiessen regarded alloys of lead and zinc)
and " solutions " (lead and tin, zinc and tin) contain a small

   III. Scales of Seitmic Intensity. By Charles Davison,
                          Sc.I).,F.G.S.*
IN every country where earthquakes are studied, the want
      of a simple scale of seismic intensity is felt, partly in
order to determine the relative intensity of different shocks,
but chiefly for the purpose of drawing isoseismal lines. The
use of accurately constructed seismographs cannot tako the
place of such a scale ; for the intensity of the shock varies so
much even in one town, that they can hardly ever exist in
sufficient number for the purpose of drawing isoseismal lines.
The superiority of a simple scale on this point of view lies
entirely in the fact that by its means we can obtain a largo
number of observations of the intensity from within a limited
area.
    Whatever the scale may be, it should satisfy the following
conditions :—
    1. The degrees of the scale should depend as far as possible
on the mechanical effects of the shock and not on personal
impressions, which may vary in different countries and with
different observers in the same country or with the same
observer at different times.
    2. Each degree of the scale should depend on one test
only, unless the exact equivalence of two tests has been
determined previously.
    3. The number and closeness of the degrees should be such
 that the scale is equally serviceable for weak, for moderately
 strong, and for destructive, earthquakes.
    (1) Comrie Scale. — Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1842, p. 93.
    The first attempt to devise a scalo of seismic intensity was,
 I believe, made on behalf of a British Association Committee
 in 1841. A strong shock occurred on Oct. 23, 1831), having
 its epicentre close to Comrie, and was followed by a large
 number of after-shocks. Very great interest was aroused by
 these earthquakes, and careful records were kept by
 Mr. Macfarlane, postmaster of Comrie, who communicated
 his notes to the British Association Committee, of which
 Mr. David Milne (afterwards Milne-Home) was secretary.
 In order to furnish a rough idea of the relative intensity of
 these shocks as felt at Comrie, Mr. Macfarlane employed an
 arbitrary scale, the intensity of the earthquake of 1835) being
 reckoned as 10. A similar scale was used to denote the
 intensity of the accompanying sound. Both scales, no doubt,
served the purpose for which they were intended, but they

other observers.
    (2) Mallet Scale.—' The Great Neapolitan Earthquake of
            1857,' vol. ii. 18G2, pp. 253-256.
    Mallet's celebrated study of the Neapolitan earthquake of
1857 was founded for the most part on observations made
within and near the epicentral region, and consequently the
scale proposed by him is one that is chiefly applicable to
destructive earthquakes.            It is given twice in the work
above-mentioned (pp. 253 & 255), and the two accounts of
it do not exactly agree. I have endeavoured to combine both
in the following table.
    5. The shock perceived by instrumental disturbance.
    4. The shock distinctly perceived by the unaided senses,
anil producing more or less alarm.
    3. Universal production of fissures, and slight dislodgments
in buildings ; little or no loss of life.
    2. Large portions of cities and towns thrown down,
persons killed and wounded by their fall.
    1. The greater part of cities and towns perfectly prostrated ;
great loss of life.
     (3) Philippine Scale.— P. Miguel Saderra Maso, ' La
             Seismologia en Filipinas' (Manila, 181)5), p. 21.
    Father Saderra Maso's scale, which has been in use since
 1870, is well adapted for a country which is not thickly
populated. The adjectives alone might not convey a very
accurate impression of the intensity of the earthquakes
described in the valuable memoir referred to above ; but the
equivalent degrees of the ltossi-Forel scale are appended to
each.      These will be found in the table at the end of this
paper.
          1. Perceptible.
          2. Slight.
          3. Ordinary.
          4. Strong.
          5. Violent.
          6. Destructive.
    (4) Kossi Scale.—Bull, del Vulc. Ital., Anno IV. 1877,
             pp. 3U-40.
    The scale drawn up in 1873 * by the late Prof. M. S. de
 Rossi, the well-known Italian seismologist, is a great step in
    * The first form of the scale with which I am acquainted is contained
 in an earlier volume of the journal above-mentioned ; it was slightly
 modified in successive years. See Anno I. 1874, p. i ; Anno II. 1875,
 p. iii; Anno III. 1876, p. i.

advance.       It is applicable to shocks of every degree of
intensity ; and the tests are fairly definite, though they
depend too much on personal impressions. It is evident that
such may varv widely in different countries. In England,
for instance, the Hereford earthquake of 1896, which threw
down many chimneys near the epicentre, was the cause of
little, if any, actual alarm. In America, on the other hand,
the same degree of intensity during the Charleston earthquake
of 1886 caused many persons to camp out for the night.
    1. Very slight shock, noted only by seismographs or by a
seismologist.
    2. Weak shock, perceived by more than one.
    3. Slight shock, perceived by many persons, or announced
in the newspapers or by non-seismologists ; and of which the
 duration and direction may be easily ascertained.
    4. Sensible shock, making fastenings, chandelier-prisms
(cristalli), and easily-moved articles shake ; creaking of Hoors.
    5. Moderate shock, perceived generally by very many
persons, making a few bells in towns ring ; felt by non-
 seismologists in many places not very near one another ;
causing beds to shake.
    6. Rather strong shock *, with more or less ringing of bells,
oscillation of lamps, stopping of clocks, in towns ; and, in the
country, visible or sensible quivering of trees and shrubs ;
some persons say that fortunately no damage occurred ;
through fear or prudence some go out into the open air ;
almost general interruption of sleep at night.
    7. Strong shock, with fall of plaster, ringing of church
bells, noise and general alarm without damage, fall of objects
and pictures.
    8. Very strong shock, with fall of chimney-pots, cracks in
buildings, flight of persons from houses.
    9. Ruinous shock, with total or partial fall of some
buildings.
  10. Disastrous shocks, with great destruction and loss of
life.
    (5) Forel Scale.—Arch, des Sci. phys. et nat. (Geneva),
            vol. vi. 1881, pp. 465-466.
    Without knowing of the existence of the Rossi scale, a
somewhat similar scale was devised by Prof. F. A. Forel, a
prominent member of the Swiss Seismological Commission
   * The original adjectives in degrees 6, 7, and 8 are " forte," " molto
forte" and " fortissinm " ; for which we have not exactly similar ex
pressions. In the Forel and Mercalli scales, the same or similar terms
occur and are translated in the same way.

fissures in the walls and ceilings of houses.
   7. Strong shock, damage to houses, chimneys thrown
down.
   8. Very strong shock, outhouses and huts thrown down.
   9. Extremely strong shock, well-built houses thrown
down.

    (6) Rotti-Forel Scale.— M. S. de Rossi. Bull. Vulc. Ital.,
           Anno X. 1883, pp. 67-08 ; F. A. Forel, Arch, des
            Sci. phys. et nat., vol. xi. 1884, pp. 148-149.
    Shortly after the preceding scale was drawn up, M. Forel
became acquainted with the earlier one employed by de Rossi.
On the invitation of the latter seismologist, they united in
revising both scales ; and the result will probably form the
foundation of seismic scales for many years to come. The
 Rossi-Forel scale has been used in Italy until within the last
 few months. It is the standard of earthquake intensity used
 by seismologists in Switzerland, Great Britain, Roumania,
 Greece, California, and Australasia. Rough and imperfect,
 as no doubt it is, this scale lias formed the starting-point of
 a distinct advance in the study of earthquakes.
    Prof. E. S. Holden, who has done so much for the investi
 gation of Californian earthquakes, has made a comparison
 between each degree of the Rossi-Forel scale and the
 corresponding maximum acceleration of an earth-particle
 calculated from seismographic records.           His results will be
 found in the last column of the table given below *.
    1. Recorded by a single seismograph, or by some seismo
 graphs of the same pattern, but not by several seismographs

   2. Recorded by seismographs of different kinds; felt by a

    3. Felt by several persons at rest ; strong enough for the
 duration or direction to be appreciable.

 movable objects, doors, windows ; creaking of floors.
   5. Felt generally by everyone ; disturbance of furniture
and beds ; ringing of some bells.

   8. Fall of chimneys, cracks in the walls of buildings.

   Though independently formed, this is nearly the same as
 that used in the Philippine Islands. It resembles the latter
also in consisting of adjectives only, the significance of which
would be indeterminate, if the author had not expressed them
in terms of the degrees of the Rossi-Forel scale.

           p. 19.
   So far as I know, this scale has only been used in the study
of the Verona earthquake of 1891.           It resembles rather
closely the modification of the Rossi-Forel scale which I have
employed in investigating British earthquakes.
   1. Very slight, noted by instruments only.
   2. Slight, felt by a few persons without the aid of instru
ments.
   3. Moderate, accompanied by general shaking of fastenings,
crystals, &c.

   4. Strong, with more or less general ringing of bells, stop
ping of clocks, oscillation of lamps.
   5. Very strong, with fall of plaster and of a few chimney
pots, cracks in buildings, ringing of bells.
   6. Almost ruinous, with total or partial fall of a few (one
or two) buildings.
   7. Ruinous ; ruin of several buildings, a little loss of life.
   (9) Japanese Scale.—Report on Earthquake Observations
           in Japan (1892), p. 10.
   With the exception of the Comrie scale, that employed in
Japan is less useful than any other mentioned in this paper,
on account of the small number of degrees which it contains.
At first sight, it is surprising that this should be the case in
the country which possesses the most complete organization
for the study of earthquakes. One reason may be the reliance
placed on seismographs, but I think that the chief reason lies
in the great frequency of earthquakes in many parts of Japan.
With the exception of those which are unusually strong for
the districts concerned, records are obtainable as a rule only
from previously prepared observers. The detailed inquiries
which are possible in Great Britain can hardly be made in a
country in which the recollection of one shock is soon after
dimmed or erased by the occurrence of another or many more
in rapid succession.
   1. Slight, just sufficient to be felt.
   2. Weak, when the motion is distinctly felt, but not so
violent as to bo necessary for people to run out-of-doors.
   3. Strong, when most people run out-of-doors, some pieces
of furniture are overturned, liquids thrown out, buildings
damaged, the ground cracked or rent.
   (10) Mercalli Scale.—Prof. G. Mercalli, ' I Terremoti della
           Liguria e del Piemonte,' p. 20 (Naples, 1897).
   The Mercalli scale is a modification of the Rossi-Forel scale,
and is now adopted as the standard of the Central Office of
Meteorology and Geodynamics at Rome. The degrees do not
correspond exactly with those of the Rossi-Forel scale, and
the equivalents given in the Table below are only approxi
mate. The limitation of both scales to ten degrees renders
the Mercalli scale rather more suitable for disastrous earth
quakes, and the Rossi-Forel scale for shocks of moderate
intensity.
   1. Instrumental shock, that is, noted by seismic instru
ments only.

    2. Very slight, felt only by a few persons in conditions of
perfect quiet, especially on the upper floors of houses, or by
many sensitive and nervous persons.
    3. Slight, felt by several persons, but by few relatively to
the number of inhabitants in a given place; said by them to
have been hardly felt, without causing any alarm, and in
general without their being sensible that it was an earthquake
 until it was known that others had also felt it.
     4. Sensible or moderate, not felt generally, but felt by
 many persons indoors, though by few on the ground-floor,
 without causing any alarm, but with shaking of fastenings,
 crystals, creaking of floors, and slight oscillation of suspended
 objects.
     5. Bather strong, felt generally indoors, but by few out
 side, with waking of those asleep, with alarm of some persons,
 rattling of doors, ringing of bells, rather large oscillation of
 suspended objects, stopping of clocks.
     6. Strong, felt by everyone indoors, and by many with
 alarm and flight into the open air; fall of objects in houses,
 fall of plaster, with some slight cracks in badly-built houses.
     7. Very strong, felt with general alarm and flight from
 houses, sensible also out-of-doors ; ringing of church-bells,
 fall of chimney-pots and tiles; cracks in numerous buildings,
 but generally slight.
     8. Ruinous, felt with great alarm, partial ruin of some
 houses, and frequent and considerable cracks in others ; with
 out loss of life, or only with a few isolated cases of personal
  injury.
     9. Disastrous, with complete or nearly complete ruin of
  some houses and serious cracks in many others, so as to
  render thorn uninhabitable ; a fow lives lost in different parts
  of populated places.
      10. Very disastrous, with ruin of many buildings and
  great loss of life, cracks in the ground, landslips from moun
  tains, &c.
      (11) Oldham Scale.—Mom. Geol. Survey of India, vol. xxix.
             1899, pp. 42-43.
      The country over which the great Indian earthquake of
  1897 was felt is "largely a wild, thinly populated country,
  and even in the thickly-populated parts brick and stone
  buildings are rare and widely scattered." In studying this
  earthquake, Mr. R. D. Oldham therefore found it impossible
  to define more than the following degrees of intensity :—
      1. The destruction of brick and stone buildings practically
  universal.

                    Scales of Seismic Intensity.                51
   2. The damage to masonry or brick buildings universal and
often serious, amounting in some cases to destruction.
   3. All, or nearly all, brick buildings damaged.
   4. The earthquake universally felt, severe enough to dis
turb furniture and loose objects, but not to cause damage
(except in a few instances) to brick buildings.
   5. The earthquake smart enough to be generally noticed,
but not severe enough to cause any damage.
    l>. The earthquake only noticed by a small proportion of
people who happened to be sensitive, and, being seated or lying
down, were favourably situated for observing it.
   (12) Scale used in studyiny British Earthquakes.—The scale
which I have used in studying British earthquakes differs but
little from the Rossi- Forel scale. The number of tests in each
degree is reduced to one in nearly every case, thus allowing
the isoseismal lines to be drawn with greater accuracy than
is attainable in a less thickly-populated country, in which single
testa might be seldom applicable. In districts which are
visited by destructive earthquakes, two additional degrees,
corresponding to degrees 9 and 10 of the Rossi-Forel scale,
would be required.
    1. Recorded only by instruments.
   2. Felt only by a few persons lying down and sensitive to
weak tremors.
   3. Felt by ordinary persons at rest, not strong enough to
disturb loose objects.
   4. Windows, doors, fire-irons, &c. made to rattle.
   5. The observer's seat perceptively raised or moved,
   ti. Chandeliers, pictures, &c. made to swing.
    7. Ornaments, vases, &c. overthrown.
   b\ Chimneys thrown down and cracks made in the walls of
some, but not many, houses in one place.
   9. f!himneys thrown down and cracks made in the walls of
about one-half of the houses in one place.
    Comparison of different Scales.—In the following Table I
have endeavoured to express the degrees of different scales in
terms of those of the Rossi-Forel scale. An asterisk affixed
to the name of a scale indicates that the correlation given is
due to the author of the scale himself.

Elastic Constants of Rocks and Velocity of Seismic Waves.         53
    Postscript.—Since the above paper was written a valuable
memoir by Prof. Omori on " Seismic Experiments on the
Fracturing and Overturning of Columns (Publications of
the Earthquake Investigation Committee in Foreign Lan
guages, No. 4, Tokyo, 1900, pp. 69-141), has reached this
country. At the close of the memoir (pp. 137-141) he gives
an "absolute scale of destructive earthquakes," the maximum
acceleration corresponding to each degree being 300, 900,
1200, 20O0, 2500, 4000, and more than 4000 mm. per sec.
per sec. respectively. The effects of a shock of each degree
on buildings &c. are described in detail. It appears also that
the Japanese scale has been modified slightly since 1892. The
form given by Prof. Omori is as follows, the corresponding
degrees of the Rossi-Forel scale being added in brackets :—
Slight (1, 2), Weak (3 to 5), Strong (b\ 7), Violent (8 to 10
and above).
IV. Elastic Constants of Rocks and the Velocity of Seismic
     Waves. By H. Nagaoka, Professor of Applied Mathe
    matics, Imperial University, Tokyo *.
 THE vibration of the earth's crust has from time to time
         been a favourite subject of discussion among the elas-
ticians, and the propagation of seismic disturbance is a
problem whose solution has long been hoped for, both from
 the theoretical and the empirical point of view. With im
 proved instruments, seismologists have recently determined
 the velocity of propagation with tolerable accuracy, but very
 little is known of the elastic nature of the medium through
 which the vibration has travelled. The resources from which
 physicists and seismologists draw their theoretical inferences
 are so scanty, that among the numerous rocks which con
 stitute the earth's crust, only a few of the most commonly
 occurring rocks have had their physical properties investigated.
 The questions of elasticity, having close bearing with the
  deformation of the earth's crust, have repeatedly been a sub
 ject of research by several distinguished elasticians as Lord
  Kelvin, Boussinesq, Oerruti, and Chree. But we are baffled
  in our attempt to apply the result of subtle analysis to the
  actual problem, from the lack of experimental knowledge
  as regards the elastic nature of the diverse rocks which com
  pose the outer coating of our planet. The present experiments
  were undertaken with a view to fill these gaps, and to supply

54        Prof. H. Nagaoka on tlie Elastic Constants of
on the one hand the wants of physicists, whose aim is to apply
dynamics to the study of the geological phenomena, and on
the other to meet the needs of seismologists, engaged in
 solving the problems touching the propagation of seismic
waves.
    Preparation of tlie Specimens.—The present experiments
 deal principally with the determination of Young's modulus
 and the modulus of rigidity, made on specimens of rocks
 which were easily accessible.
    The number of rocks examined amounted to about eighty
 different specimens collected from various localities. These
 rocks were first cut in the shape of a rectangular parallele
 piped, and afterwards carefully polished into prisms of nearly
 1 centim. square cross-section and 15 centim. length. It
 was at first proposed to experiment with much larger speci
 mens, but it was generally found impossible to find a large
 homogeneous piece with no trace of cleavage ; in addition to
 this, the apparatus with which the elastic constants were to
 be measured would become cumbrously large, and require
 great solidity, increasing at the same time the difficulties of
experiment.
    Most of the specimens were apparently isotropic, but on
 close examination it was found that the isotropy was only
 superficial. Rocks as slates with distinct sedimentation planes
 were generally cut parallel and perpendicular to them ; where
 such planes of symmetry were not easily discernible, the
specimen was conveniently cut into prisms.
    The thickness of these prisms was measured by a contact
 micrometer reading, by means of a vernier, to ¦j-fo millim.
at three different places in the middle line of two opposite
faces ; namely, one at the middle and two at one quarter
distance from the ends. The mean density of the prism was
measured by dividing the mass by the volume, which was
calculated from the known length and thickness. The density
of several prisms cut from the same sample did not generally
agree, showing that the material was only roughly homo
geneous.
   Modulus of Elasticity.—Young's modulus was measured
bj- flexure experiment. The specimen to be tested was placed
on two steel wedges, which served as fulcrums. The edge of
the wedge was slightly rounded in order to prevent cutting
on applying heavy weights. The flexure due to the weight
hung at the middle of the prism was measured by means of
a scale and telescope. By a special arrangement, a plane
mirror was attached to the prism at the place where it rested
ou the wedges. The mirror was nearly vertical and the image

            Rocks and the Velocity of Seismic Waves.           M
of the vertical scale divided in millim., and placed at a dis
tance of 2*73 m., was observed by a telescope provided
with a filar micrometer. By this means, the deflexion of 1"
was easily measurable.
   Denoting the length and the thickness of the prism by b
and r respectively, the distance between the fulerums by a,
and the angle of deflexion by 8, we obtain for the modulus
of elasticity E
                                  3W
                                  ibc*8'
where W stands for the weight suspended in the middle of
the prism.
   The elastic heterogeneity of rocks called for the necessity
of examining the constants in different directions ; for this
purpose, the prism was placed on its different faces on the
fulcrum and the moduli for two mutually perpendicular
directions were generally measured. These are denoted by
Et and E3 in the table of the elastic constants, and the mean
of these two by E.
   Modulus of Rhiidity.—The modulus of rigidity was deter
mined by measuring the amount of torsion produced by a
given couple. It would lead too far were I to attempt to describe
the details of the instrument. The rectangular prism R was
placed horizontal and firmly clamped at both its extremities
to two solid pieces, Ii, Ia of iron. In order to prevent crack
ing by too firmlv clamping, four small pieces of brass plate

   56        Prof. H. Nagaoka on the Elastic Constants of
   with thin sheet lead underneath were interposed between the
   four faces of the prism and the clamping screws. I, was
   fixed to a solid iron frame. The central steel cylinder pro
   truding from I2 was filed down to a sharp knife-edge on its
    axis, coinciding with the central line of the prism. An agate
    plane attached to another solid iron frame supported the knife-
    edge and the twisting pulley P. To the cylinder above
    referred to, a pulley Pi of 14 centim. diameter was firmly
    fixed ; a flexible string sx attached to a pin p on the circum
    ference of the pulley passed over it, and was tied to a light
    wooden cross-bar c. Another string s2 was attached to the
    pulley, and instead of passing over it, was slung around
    another pulley P2 such that the line of passage ss from P, to
    P2 was vertical. The string on going over P3 in the opposite
    direction to the former string was again let down vertical and
    attached to the cross-bar. By hanging the weight at the
     middle of the bar, the tension was the same in both strings
     and gave rise to a couple = radius of the pulley x weight.
     By this arrangement, the knife-edge did not support the load
     producing the twisting couple, that of the prism, clamp, and
     pulley being the only weight acting. The amount of torsion
     was measured by observing the deflexion of two mirrors Mt
     and M2, one attached to the prism near the fixed clamp I.!
     and the other near I8. The deflexions, as measured by a
     vertical scale and two telescopes, were generally large com
     pared with those in flexure experiments, so that no micrometric
     measurement was needed. The difference between the two
     scale-readings gave the torsion between the two places where
     the mirrors were fixed by special clamp screws.
        Denoting the sides of the prism by b and c, the torsion for
    unit length by t, the twisting couple by N, and the rigidity
    by fi, we get by St. Venant's formula for the torsion of a rect
    angular prism the following expression for N
               {(•in—lXire                                   f2n-V\*c^

     It may be a question whether it is justifiable to use St. Venant's
     formula in the present experiment, as the boundary conditions
     are somewhat different from those considered by St. Venant
     in deducing the above result. As the length of the prism was
     large compared with its thickness, and as the twist t was
     measured at points not very near the ends of the prism, the
     result given by using the above formula will not be materially

different from the actual value. When the rock is of stratified
structure and shows great difference in its elastic behaviour
the formula will require modification, but in studying the
elasticity of rocks in its broad features, the modulus of rigidity
calculated in the above manner will not be far from the
general mean. The calculation of the series involved in the
above formula is somewhat tedious. Fortunately, St. Venant
has calculated a table of

for different values of .-.         As the section of the prism was
 nearly square shaped, it was thought advisable to calculate
 the sum of the series at small intervals, when the ratio .- is
 nearly unity. As such tables will sometimes be found useful,
 I give the result of calculation in the following table :—

   58         Prof, fl. Nagaoka on the Elastic Constanta of
      Hooke's Law and Elastic. A/ter-Effect.— Preliminary expe»
   riments with granite showed that Hooke's law does not hold
   even for very small flexure and torsion, and that the after
   effect is very considerable when the prism is sufficiently
   loaded or twisted ; the deviation from the direct propor
   tionality between the strain and stress was incomparably
   threat compared with that observed in common metals. This
   must be chiefly due to the low limit of elasticity, so that it
   is necessary to experiment only within narrow limits of loading
   or twisting. These limits arc widely different for different
   specimens of rocks, and the modulus of elasticity as well as
   that of rigidity was always determined with such stresses as
   will approximately produce strains proportional to them.
      The deviation from Hooke's law was prominent in certain
   specimens of sandstones, and it was more marked in torsion
   than in flexure experiments. In certain rocks it is indeed
   doubtful if anything like a proportionality between stress and
   strain can be found even for extremely small change of shape.
   On releasing these rocks from stress the return towards the
   former state is extremely small, showing that the elasticity of
    rocks is of very inferior order. The elastic yielding of rocks
    under continuous action of stress is very remarkable, as the

            ttochs and the Velocity of Seismic Waves.           59
   It will be seen that the initial deflexion amounts to 47-8 mm.;
the torsion of the prism gradually increases in course of a few
minutes, so that after a lapse of about 19 minutes the increase
of deflexion is nearly 30 per cent, of the initial. The increase
becomes asymptotic with time.
   The above-mentioned property of rocks will be of no small
interest in dynamical geology, as it naturally illustrates the
possibility of the folding of rocks and other kindred phe
nomena pertaining to the manifold change of shape in rocks,
wrought by the continuous action of stress.
    Velocity of Elastic Waves.—It was my intention to deter
mine the modulus of elasticity, and then calculate the velocity
of propagation of the longitudinal as well as that of the
transversal waves, on the supposition that the material is
isotropic. A few experiments with rocks of different ages
showed that these attempts are for the most part fruitless, as
the .assumption of isotropy was not generally admissible. With
archaean and palaeozoic rocks it was possible to work them into
proper shape for experiment only in a certain direction, as
they were generally of schistose structure, and extremely
brittle in the direction perpendicular to it ; in such cases the
elastic behaviour was of course widely different in these
directions. Even with granite, which apparently is homo
geneous in structure, the difference of elasticity with direction
was noticed. On examination, these rocks were found to have
been pressed from one side during formation, and this left its
trace in the relation of strain to stress. For the complete
discussion of the elastic nature of these rocks the determination
of the moduli of elasticity and of rigidity considered as an
isotropic substance is insufficient; we are in fact dealing with
quasi-crystalline bodies, so that the number of elastic constants
must depend on the number of symmetry-planes which can be
drawn in these rocks. The type of the elastic waves travelling
in such a medium will be determined, when all of these
constants are known. As we have no simple means of
examining these symmetry-planes, a single modulus of elas
ticity and rigidity was determined, on the supposition that
the material is isotropic.
    In the discussion of the propagation of seismic waves we
have to deal with wave-lengths which measure over a kilo
 metre. Geologists tell us that uniform strata of a kilometre
 thickness are of rare occurrence; and it may be doubted if
these waves do not suffer change of type and shape in tra
 versing the earth's crust. Unquestionably longitudinal plane
 waves whose velocity of propagation in an isotropic medium

        is given by the formula \i                      (following Lame's nota
        tion) would seldom come into existence. A complete dis
        cussion of waves in quasi-crystalline rocks requires complicated
        analysis, which necessitates the knowledge of the elastic be
        haviour of rocks cut in various directions. To obtain a
        general view of the propagation I have thought it advisable
        to calculate V, = \/ - for the longitudinal waves.                      Suppose
        the Young's modulus E is determined by flexure experiment*
        on a prism cut parallel to a plane of symmetry, then V; will
        give the velocity of longitudinal waves travelling along the
        prism. The velocity in the sense above explained is given
        under V„ and the velocity of the transversal wave \/ —
        under V/. I do not mean to say that the actual velocity of
        longitudinal waves in various rocks is given by V'; but when
        such values are not obtainable, Vi will probably give a rough
        estimate. The elastic constants of rocks are tabulated in the
        order of geological age; for the same geological age those
        with larger velocity of propagation V, come before those with
        the slower.

  0-11554-Y/pas the difference of rigidity in different spe
  cimens is so great that the presence of the factor 0-9554 will
  not materially affect the result.
      General Result.— In examining the elastic constants of
  rocks classified according to the age of formation, we find a
  distinct gradation as we pass from those of recent for
  mation to the oldest. The increase of density, as well as the
  quasi-crystalline behaviour of rocks, is the most important
  characteristic of rocks which are deeply embedded in the

  64       Prof. H. Nagaoka on the Elastic Constants of
  earth's crust. The chlorite schist of Chichibu has a density
  nearly equal to 3, although its modulus of elasticity is greater
 than that of brass or copper with a rod cut in the direction of
 strongest tenacity, it is so brittle in the direction perpendicular
 to it that it is impossible to obtain a single specimen with
 which the elastic constant can be accurately determined. The
 elastic constants are widely different as the specimen is cut
 in one or other direction, especially in archaean and palaeozoic
 rocks, as schists and slates with distinct sedimentation planes.
 Rocks of eruptive origin are generally free from such direc
 tional behaviour; but when they are pressed or otherwise
 subject to continuous application of stress, the difference of
 elasticity in different directions can still be traced. Such
 appears to be the case with marble and granite.
    The elastic constants of archaean and palaeozoic rocks are far
 superior to those of the cainozoic; but the velocity of propa
 gation of longitudinal or transversal waves is not proportionally
 large. As the ratio of the elastic constant to density deter
 mines the velocity of propagation, we cannot at once conclude
 from the increase of elasticity that the waves travel with
 greater velocity. It would be too bold to draw anything like
 a general conclusion from the examination of some eighty
 specimens ; but so far as the present experiments go, the
 tendency is such that the elastic constants increase more
 rapidly than the density as the rock becomes denser, and
 consequently elastic waves travel with greater velocity in the
 interior than on the surface of the earth's crust. Eruptive
 rocks are more isotropic than those of non-igneous origin,
 and have inferior elasticity; but there is the same distinction
 with age. Elastic waves in eruptive palaeozoic rocks travel
 with slower velocity than in those of the archaean of the same
 origin ; a similar remark applies to cainozoic rocks with a
 few exceptions.
    As we go deep in the earth's crust the rocks generally
assume schistose structure; we have reason to believe that the
elastic constants of the constituent rocks increase in a certain
particular direction, which evidently coincides with that of
swiftest propagation of elastic disturbance. Pressed by the
weight of the superincumbent crust, these rocks will be of
greater density; so that the increase of elastic constants is
attended with corresponding increase of density. We cannot
conceive that the elastic constant or the density will conti
nually increase as we approach the centre of the earth ; they
will both attain asymptotic values. The alternatives are :
either the ratio of elastic constants to density goes on gra
dually increasing, or it first reaches a maximum and then

              Rocks and the Velocity of Seismic Wares.          1)5
 goes on decreasing.        The former supposition makes the
 velocity of elastic waves increase from the surface towards
 the centre of the earth, while the latter implies the existence
 of the stratum of maximum velocity of propagation. Such a
 stratum, if it exists, will lie pretty deep in the earth's crust,
 and will be inaccessible to us ; but the question will l>e settled
 by the seismologists.
     Velocity of Propagation of Seismic Waves.—A glance at the
 table of elastic constants will show the complex clastic nature
 of rocks composing the earth's crust. The jwth pursued by
 waves of disturbance must necessarily assume very compli
 cated forms, as they are subject to manifold reflexion, re
 fraction, and dispersion. We can perhaps borrow analogv
 from a kindred optical phenomenon of curved rays in a
 medium of heterogeneous density, studied experimentally by
 Mace de Lepinay and Perot, and theoretically discussed by
 A. Schmidt and Wiener. The phenomena presented by the
 seismic wave will be of still more complex character as the
 medium is of quasi-crystalline nature, and the wave may suffer
 refraction something akin to that of light in Iceland-spar and
arragonite. The elastic constants of rocks through which
 the disturbance propagates will rarely satisfy the condition
of giving rise to purely longitudinal or distortional waves, so
 that the seismic wave will be of a mixed character. What
 Mr. Milne designates earthquake echoes or reverberations
will partly find explanation in the intricate behaviour of
diverse rocks in relation to the elastic wave travelling through
them. The waves propagated from the centre of disturbance
will appear on the seismograph as undulations of irregular
periods, especially near the origin. At a distance waves of
short period will gradually die out owing to the greater
damping effect, while those of long period will still leave
their mark, although not felt by us as a shock.
   The investigation of the seismic waves affords the best
means of feeling the pulse of the interior of the earth ; the
elastic nature and the density distribution of the constituent
rocks, or even the condition of the inaccessible depth, will in
some future day be 'brought to light by the patient study
of the disturbances, which traverse the strata of hetero
geneous structure and appear as tremors or earthquakes on
the earth's surface. I think the introduction of the hori
zontal pendulum is a great progress in that branch of study
which relates to the earth's interior, not that it records the
apparent surface-movement of the soil, but that it does not
fail to record earthquakes of distant origin, which, though
insensible to us, sometimes appear ns slow waves of gigantic

66        Prof. H. Nagaoka on the Elastic Constants of
amplitude. By it will be found disturbances which come
through various strata, and probably those travelling through
the stratum of maximum velocity of propagation.
    Seismic waves travelling through strata of heterogeneous
elasticity and density will generally be not purely longi
tudinal as in the case of sound, nor purely transversal as in
the case of light, but a mixture of these two kinds. The
 velocity of propagation expressed as a function of elastic con
 stants and density is not a simple problem ; and moreover we
 do not possess sufficient experimental data to test the result
 of calculation.    The formula V,= \ / — for longitudinal
                                            . P
 waves in a thin rod will give a rough estimate of the velocity.
     From records taken in Italy and Japan, Prof. Omori con
 cludes that the velocity of the first tremor is almost always
 equal to 13 kilometres per sec. The question naturally arises :
 how can we account for such an enormous rate of propagation ?
 The velocity of plane longitudinal waves in an infinite
 medium of steel is about 6'2 kilometres per second ; it' we
 take a rod of steel in place of an uniform medium and give
 a blow to one of its ends, the longitudinal wave will travel
 with a velocity of 5'3 kilometres ; if the same experiment be
 repeated on a piece of iron pyrites cut parallel to its axis of
 greatest elasticity, the velocity will be 8"4 kil. per second ;
 in topaz, it will amount to D kilometres. Thus even with
 substances easily accessible on the earth's surface, we have
 instances of elastic waves travelling with a velocity of some
 thing like 10 kilometres. In the present experiments the
 velocity in several primeval rocks ranges from 6 to 7 kil.
 per second ; as we go deeper in the crust, we may not. fail to
 find those rocks whose elastic constants are several times
 greater than those near the surface. So far as I am aware,
 iron pyrites has the greatest modulus of elasticity among the
 substances which have till now been placed under experi
 mental test ; it is about 1*6 times greater than in steel, and
 amounts to 3-5 x 1012 c.G.s. units (Voigt).          If we now
 imagine a stratum in which Young's modulus exceeds that
  of iron pyrites as much as that of iron pyrites exceeds that of
  steel, we shall obtain a velocity arrived at by seismologists, if
 density is not at the same time increased so much as to bring
 down the rate of propagation. The velocity of 13 kilometres
  per second, which is that calculated from the preliminary
 tremors, roughly corresponds to JB = (vO x 1 (J12 and p = 3*5. To
  speak of the relation between density and elastic constant
  might seem a little absurd, but in the rocks so far examined,

             Rocks and the Velocity of Seismic Waves.           67
a certain relation between these two physical constants seems
to exist. Comparing the elastic constants of cainozoic and
archaean rocks, we find that with the increase of density
from 2 to 3, the modulus of elasticity has increased more
than ten times in certain specimens. Thus it would not be
a wild conjecture to put E = o" x 1012 when the density is 3*5.
As the mean density of the earth is little over 5*5, we shall
come across a stratum of the density above cited not very far
from the surface. These considerations give support to the
view above stated that there is a stratum of maximum velocity
of propagation.
    From the minute study of the records of distant earth
quakes, Prof. Omori found that in the intermediate position
between the first tremor and the principal shock, there is
almost always a slight abrupt change in the seismograph
record. The velocity of propagation for this kind of dis
turbance is about 7 kilometres per second. If wo suppose
that the interior of the earth consists of an isotropic substance,
and that the longitudinal wave travelling through it gives rise
to the first tremor, and the transversal to the second, we can
easily find the Poisson ratio of the hypothetical interior.

                            2(X. + /i)
This value is nearly the same as that generally attributed to
 iron, glass, and other isotropic substances. In his paper on the
Application of Physics and Mathematics to Seismology (Phil.
 Mag. 1897), Dr. Chree supposes that the velocity of 12*5 kilo
metres belongs to the longitudinal wave, that of 2*5 to the
transversal, and adduces proof that the substance in the
interior of the earth offers enormous resistance to compression.
On the above supposition, Young's modulus turns out to be
 100 xlO10 c. a. s. units, which is less than that observed on
chlorite schist. It seems quite unlikely that the elastic con
 stants of the deeply-seated material should be less than those
within a few thousand feet of the earth's crust. In addition
 to this, we have to remark that the disturbance whose velocity
 is greater than 10 kilometres is very small compared to that
 of the principal shock, which is generally 3 kilometres ; and
 we have no ground to suppose that the effect of the trans
 versal wave is greater than that of the longitudinal. On the
 hypothesis that the interior of the earth consists of homo-

68    Elastic Constants of R>cka and Velocity of S sltm'x Wiw;.
geneous substance, as Dr. Wiechert assumes it to be, it is
quite probable that tlie velocity of the longitudinal wave is
13 kilometres, and that of the transversal wave is about
7 kilometres, as found by Prof. Omori. These velocities are
nearly twice as great as those observed in the oldest rocks
here examined.
    Elastic waves travel with slow velocity in surface rocks.
If the principal shocks in the seismometer-record be taken
into account, the velocity turns out to be very small and
about 3"3 kilometres. This evidently is about the mean
velocity of propagation in most of the surface rocks, and
shows that waves of large amplitude creep along the surface.
It is not wonderful that with distant earthquakes, the duration
 sometimes extends over several hours, as the disturbance
 travels through strata of different elastic constants, and the
 waves modified in various ways will appear all blended to
 gether on the seismograph. Although 3 kilometres may be
 a mean velocity, there are certain surface rocks in which the
 velocity i3 less than a kilometre. The shock at the epicentre
 may last only for a short time, but the duration at a distance
 will he lengthened, as the range of velocity is very wide. The
 disturbance coming from the strata of greatest rate of propaga
 tion will first make its appearance at the beginning of the
 preliminary tremor, followed by waves travelling with slower
 velocity till the principal shock arrives as surface waves. It
 will be followed by waves travelling with still slower velocity
 leaving faint record on the seismograph, till they at length
 fade away. Neglecting the time of passage from the stratum
 above mentioned to the surface, it is natural to expeot that
 the duration of the so-called preliminary tremor preceding
 the earthquake shock increases linearly with the distance of the
 epicentre from the place of observation. The above relation
 was established from various earthquakes which happened in
 Japan, recorded by Prof. Omori.
     With great earthquakes which are perceptible on a seismo
 graph a.t very great distances, the duration will continually
 increase with distance ; the disturbance may sometimes pro
 pagate still unabated in one or other direction round the earth.
 If the last-mentioned case actually takes place, the tremor will
 probably last even for days. As such records have sometimes
 been obtained by seismologists, it may not be out of place
 here to notice the possibility for such undulatory movement
  of the ground.
     In conclusion, I wish to express my thanks to Prof. Koto
 and Mr. Fukuchi for valuable information concerning the
 geological and petrological character of rocks examined in
 the present experiment.

 1.    J A CK of knowledge of the Laws of Strength.—From
      ¦*-' the point of view of both pure and applied science,
 it would be of interest to know the complete laws of the
 strength of materials ; but although a multitude of tests have
 been made in certain simple modes, our knowledge of the
 laws of strength has been extended by few experiments
 exposing the material to two or mores principal stresses, and
  thus, except in the simpler cases, the elastician is without
  experimental guidance as to what he should seek analytically
  as determining the strength of the bodv under consideration.
     In the series of. experiments herein described the materials
  employed have been subjected to a certain variety of simul
  taneous principal stresses; and the results are recorded in the
  hope that they will prove of services to elasticians and engineers.
     The simplest, and most primitive, method of ascertaining
  the strength of a material is to subject a cylindrical specimen
  of it to a direct tension or compression, and to increase the
  force until the specimen breaks or collapses ; the breaking-
  stress, thus found, being taken as the basis for calculations of
  the strength of all pieces of that material used in structures or
  machines.
      As material is frequently exposed to torsion, another fre
  quently employed test is to break a circular cylinder of
  material by the application of a torque, the stress so found
  being used in calculations for shafts, &c.
      2. Separation of the Isotropic Materials into Ductile and
   Brittle.—A consideration of the form of the fractured surface
   in the .various types of test affords some suggestions. In the
   case of ductile materials such as iron and steel (structural)
   broken by tension, the material draws out at the point of
   rupture and the surfaces of fracture, plane or conical, are
   partly or entirely inclined to the axis of the specimen at
   about 45°. It) however, cast iron be broken in tension, there

            Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.            71
is no evidence of drawing out, and the fracture is practically
normal to the axis of the specimen. When ductile speci
mens are broken in torsion, the surfaces of rupture are normal
to the axis ; but in the case of cast iron the surface of rupture
takes a curious form, one of the edges of the fracture of a
circular cylindrical specimen being a helix whose angle is
about 45°. Some steels of a treacherous nature exhibit a
fracture partaking of the two types, part of it being normal to
the axis, but part extending along the length of the specimen
and having the helical edge. Under compression ductile
materials ultimately give way by lateral flow ; cast-iron spe
cimens exhibit rupture-surfaces inclined to the axis at
about 30°.
   It will be noticed that in all cases the ductile materials
exhibit rupture-surfaces coincident to a large extent with the
surfaces of maximum shearing- stress, suggesting that the final
action in such cases partakes of the nature of a viscous flow.
Cast iron, however, under tension and torsion fractures along
the surfaces across which the tension or elongation is greatest;
in compression it appears to fail by a shearing action, in
 fluenced perhaps by the friction of the crystals.
   These illustrations of modes of fracture tend to show that a
sharp line of demarcation may be drawn between the behaviour
under stress of ductile and other materials, and this in spite
of the gradual transition from one stage to the other in
manufacture and in use.
    Owing to the increasing tendency to substitute steel for
cast iron in structures and machines, the ductile materials
were selected as the subject of experiment ; steel of four grades,
copper, and brass have been experimented upon.
    3. The Yield-point in Tension Tents.—Upon observing the
 operation of testing more carefully and taking measurements
 of the extension at frequent intervals, we notice that under
the lower loads the specimen stretches so very slightly as
 hardly to affect the beam of the testing-machine. This con
 tinues until we reach a point called the yield-point, marked
 by a large extension of the specimen for a slight increase of
 load, the lever of the testing-machine in consequence moving
 considerably. At the same time the scale, if there is any, on
the specimen peels oft', starting by cracks inclined at about 45°
 to the generating-lines, separating the scale into squares; or if
 the specimen be machined, certain characteristic changes take
 place upon its surface. After some time the stretching under
 this load ceases and the load on the specimen can be increased,
 the elongation also increasing until rupture takes place.
 The loads and the measurements of the extension they pro-

is shown in fig. 1, which is reproduced from a diagram
(for Swedish iron) drawn automatically by a Wieksteed
testing-machine, the ordinates being loads and the abscissa;
actual extensions in an original length of 7 inches. Up to
the yield-point the extension is very small, being about one-
thousandth part of the length of the specimen ; the final
elongation, however, was in this case 21) per cent, of the
original length.
    4. The Yield-point, rather than the ultimate, Stress the cri-
tei'ion of strength.—A closer examination into the relation of
the stress and strain below the yield-point shows that they are
proportional to one another (Hooke's law), and it is upon
this proportionality, or rather upon a generalization of which
the above is a special case, that the theory of elasticity is based.
Now if over any portion of a body the yield-point of the
material is exceeded, the basis of our calculations is vitiated,
and the redistribution of stress and strain may be widely
different from the proposed distribution and lead to imme
diate failure. For this reason the yield-point, rather than the
breaking, strength should be taken as the criterion of the
strength of a ductile material in simple tension.
    Further arguments to the same effect arise from Wohler's
experiments, in which he showed that the frequent repetition
of a stress slightly exceeding the yield-point stress will finally
cause rupture. The yield-point as the criterion of strength
is so far accepted in modern practice, that most specifications
of steel now call for a yield-point not lower than one half the
ultimato strength.
     5. Variations of the Ultimate and Yield-point Stresses:
 Annealing.—Neither the ultimate nor the yield-point stress
 for a material is quite definite. For the former, besides
 depending upon the taking account of, or the neglect of, the
 reduction of area due to drawing out, is affected by the rate
 of application of the load ; in fact, the phenomena displayed
 by ductile materials under stresses approaching their ultimate
 value are rather the dynamics of a semiviscous fluid than
 the statics of an elastic body. And the yield-point is affected
 bv mechanical treatment.
     If in a tension test, after the stress-strain curve has begun
 to rise after passing the yield-point, the load be removed, the
 specimen is to all appearance unchanged. Let it, however,
 be regarded as a new specimen and be tested : it will exhibit
 a yield-point close to the greatest stress previously applied to
 it ; but a continuance of the test will show that its capability
 of extension has been diminished. Such false yield-points,

74              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
due to stresses or mechanical treatment, can be removed by
annealing, which is generally considered to render the material
isotropic.
    6. The Elastic Limit.—It would so far appear that the
yield-point is a definitely defined point with the material in
its normal condition, but a closer examination of the phe
nomena involved brings to light a difficulty in its accurate
determination. In addition to the autographic curve in fig. 1,
a highly magnified edition of the same curve is shown, the
points on this curve being obtained by the use of an extenso-
meter ; the curve is referred to as the " extensometer curve."
At some point D iu the extensometer curve (fig. 1), before
the yield-point A, the stress-strain curve for the material
ceases to be a straight line, and at the same point a time-effect
manifests itself, the material yielding a little for some time
after the application of the load. This time-effect renders
the value of the strain just as the yield-point is reached a
somewhat vague quantity ; it, however, does not very materi
ally affect the determination of the stress at the yield-point.
The point at which this deviation of the straight line and
time-effect appears is usually known as the elastic limit. I
shall refer to the effect of time upon the strain and to the
deviation of the stress-strain curve from linearity as the
elastic-limit effect.
    7. The Elastic-limit effect due to the existence of Local
  Yield-points.—This phenomenon may be one sui generis, but,
partly as the departure from the straight line and the mani
festation of the time-effect are simultaneous, I am inclined to
think that it is duo to local variations in the material, which
 partly by disturbing the uniform distribution of stress and
 strain in their neighbourhood, and partly by their nature,
 result in small volumes of the material reaching the yield-
 point prematurely, and so cause the specimen as a whole to
exhibit a foreshadowing of the yield-point phenomena. On
 this supposition, if a specimen be once strained, as a whole,
 up to or beyond the yield-point, at the locations which give
 rise to the elastic-limit effect, the strain would be carried well
 beyond the yield-point; and if the load were removed, on a
 subsequent test they would contribute no time-effect until
 their new yield-point was reached, which would occur simul
 taneously with the yield-point of the whole specimen ; hence
a specimen would display no elastic-limit effect, or at any rate
 a very much reduced one, on a second testing. This agrees
 with experiment, and illustrations of it will be pointed out
 later. (See figs. 1G, 17, & 18.)
    Furthermore, although the effect is removed from a par

             Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.             75
ticular kind of test, it is unaffected, or even increased, for tests
involving the application of stresses of a different type;
examples of this may be seen in figs. 1G & 18, in which a
tension and a torsion test respectively upon the material are
compared, the material in the interval of the two tests having
been subjected to yield-point stresses of a different type.
    Not very many years ago the existence of the yield-point
was not recognized, the stress-strain curve sketched as normal
showing a gradual bend over (somewhat similar to the copper
tension tests shown in figs. 21-24). This would be the case
 with imperfect material, the portions of the material in the
 neighbourhood of flaws and variations reaching the yield-
 point successively, and so masking the phenomena. There is
 no doubt that the materials of construction as produced to-day
 are much more uniform and free from defects than those of a
 quarter of a century ago, and thus can display phenomena
 perhaps hidden in the past by their imperfections.
     It should be noted that the same effect (elastic-limit effect)
 on the stress-strain curve is caused by the non-coincidence of
 the axis of the specimen with the load-line.
     8. The Yield-point, in preference to the Elastic limit, selected
 as the criterion of strength,—The elastic-limit effect may
 then be merely due to local yielding, and taking this view of
 it I have regarded the yield-point as the true criterion of the
 strength of the material, and sometimes have assumed that
 Hooke's law held up to it.
     In all those of the experiments of this series which were
 made upon steel, a yield-point, sometimes much obscured by
 elastic-limit phenomena, was sought for and determined ; and
 evidence will be given to show that, although there is on the
 whole a slight tendency for an annealed specimen, when
 frequently stressed, to have its yield-point rise, yet, if the
  material be not much strained at the yield-points, this rise is
  not very large, especially if the type of stress be varied. In
 the case of copper, the curves obtained were such as to make
  it difficult to determine the yield-point, if indeed one exists;
  several of the curves, however, have been plotted out so that
 the range of choice may be appreciated.
     9. Torsion, a cane of Combined Stress.—The case of torsion
  presents a case of combined stresses, two principal stresses
  being equal in amount but opposite in sign, while the third
  is zero. Of such tests a large number have been made on
  round bars, but the essentials of the phenomena involved are
  masked by the variation of strain from the axis outwards,
  which causes the outer layers to reach the yield-point first,
  and so produce effects corresponding to the explanation above

7fi              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
fiven of the elastic-limit effect in simple tension. As any
   efects in the material will contribute their effect, the result
is that it is practically impossible to select the yield-point, or
to determine with any degree of precision the point where
 the curve first deviates from the straight line.
     10. First reason for use of Thin Tubes as specimens. —To
avoid this masking of the phenomena, I conducted my ex
periments upon thin tubes, the walls of which were from
?h *° 2s °f *ne ra(lius m thickness. I also tested two solid
  >ars, more to ascertain, from the agreement of the elastic
constants with their known values, that no large mistake had
been made in the measurement of the parts of the apparatus.
An inspection of the torsion stress-strain, or rather torque-
twist curves (fig. 15), for these bars will show the practical
impossibility of locating the yield-point (or the elastic-limit,
if it be a true phenomenon), particularly if we bear in mind
 Mr. Love's theorem that a small round flaw will double the
 shearing-stress in its neighbourhood, which if the flaw were
near the surface would produce the elastic-limit effect at about
half the true yield-point torque.
    11. Results of previous Torsion Experiments.—Published
results of torsion experiments (see Unwin, ' Machine Design/
vol. i.) make the elastic strength of iron and bronze in torsion
to be from (H>25 to 0-735 of the strength in tension: for
copper the ratio is about 0"545. The ratio of the ultimate
strengths is a little higher. The ultimate strength in torsion
should be determined by the use of the formula T=^7ryr3,
 which considers the whole of the material across a normal
 section to be in the same state of stress, but as the employ
ment of this formula is not universal, the ratio of the ultimate
stresses is open to suspicion.
     12. Previous experiments upon the Yield-point under Com-
 lined Stress.— Beyond the numerous experiments upon torsion,
the only experiments upon the j'ield-point which I have
 been able to find are those made upon pianoforte-wire by
 Mr. McFarlane for Lord Kelvin's article upon Elasticity in
 the Encyelopa'dia Britannica. These showed that a simul
 taneous tension lowered the yield-point in torsion, but
 numerical data are not given. Lord Kelvin concludes that
as a tension lowers the torsional yield-point, a compression
would raise it; but his argument does not appear to be rigorous,
and I venture to think that cither tension or compression
would lower it.
    13. Experiments upon Ultimate Strength under Combined
Stress.— Of experiments upon the ultimate strength under
combined stress, there are the well-known experiments of

             Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.            77
Tresca, which show that a ductile material eventually behaves
like a very viscous fluid, and a few experiments performed by
Messrs. W. Voigt and L. Januszkiewiez on wax rods sub
jected to tension only, and to tension and external fluid pressure
 (compressed air) combined. In the latter case it was found
that at rupture the shearing-stress in the material was the
same in the two cases, thus agreeing with Tresea's experiments
upon metals.
    14. Theories of Elastic Strength under Combined Stress :
 the Maximum Stress Theory. —As examples of combined
stress continually arise in practice, some working theory as
 to the criterion of strength, preferably elastic strength, must
 be assumed and adopted. Two theories hold the field to-day.
 The first is the assumption, it can hardly be called by any
 more ambitious name, that the material yields when one of
 the principal stresses reaches a certain amount, which must, by
 taking a special case, be the stress determined by a simple
 tension experiment. This was the theory adopted, in the
 absence of experimental data, by Rankine, and it is the one
 used by English and American engineers.
    As all experiments upon torsion give results at wide variance
 with this theory, it can hardly be considered to be correct ; and
 if it is used, a different working stress should be adopted in
 cases of torsion or systems of stress approximating thereto.
     15. The Maximum Strain Theory. —The second theory is
 that the material yields when the greatest strain reaches a
 certain amount, which must, taking a special case, be the
 yield-point strain in simple tension. This theory was first advo
 cated by St. Venant as fitting in with that molecular theory
 which leads to the uniconstant theory of elasticity. Upon
  this theory the value of Poisson's ratio, or the ratio of lateral
 contraction to axial extension of a specimen under simple
 tension, is 0"25 ; upholders of the theory maintaining that
  variations from this valuo which experiment exhibits are due
 to imperfections of the material. The greatest-strain theory
 is that adopted upon the Continent, and is strongly upheld by
 many elasticians.
     1(5. Theorem upon the Limiting Values of a-. — In the case
  of a cube of elastic material, whose elastic constants are B
 and q (E being Young's modulus, or the ratio of stress to
 strain in a simple tension test), subjected to a uniform fluid
  pressure p, the linear contraction is £(1 — 2o-).     If the con
  stitution of the material is to be stable, this must be a positive
  quantity, and henco the maximum value of a is 0"5. This
 also shows that an isotropic stable material cannot decrease in

 78             Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
volume under a simple tension (else it would decrease volu-
 metrically under three orthogonal tensions).
    It is hardly conceivable that cr should be negative, but it
 cannot be less than —1; otherwise the material would be
unstable under torsion as the energy of a simple shear,
 p (1 + a), would be negative should 1 +o- be negative.
    The values of a- met with in the course of experiments
 undertaken will be found in Table V. They are not determined
 by a method possessing much accuracy, being; found from the
values of E and C ; they are, however, sufficiently accurate
for the purpose in view.
    17. The Maximum Strain Theory not disproved by published
experiments.—Upon the maximum strain theory of strength
the yield-point stress under torsion to that under tension
should be 0*80 for cases in which <7=0"25. The least value
of this ratio will occur when a is a maximum, i.e. when cr = 0"5,
the value then being QG6. As the experimental results quoted
above place this ratio, for steel, between 0'(!25 and 0-735, it
will be seen that, taking into consideration the effect of flaws
 upon a torsion test and the difficulty of locating the yield-
point, the experimental results cannot be held to disprove the
theory, although they militate against it.
    In discussing the phenomena of torsion, Tresca separates
the state of the material into three stages : the elastic state,
the plastic stage, and an intermediate condition. These
correspond to the portions OA, B(J. and AB respectively in
a stress-strain curve such as fig. 1. St. Venant, followed by
many elasticians, does not recognize the intermediate stage,
and considers that Hooke's law holds up to the point at which
plasticity begins ; he adopts Tresca's results that in the plastic
stage the shearing-force is constant, and upholds a specific
maximum strain as the condition of limiting elasticity.
   I fail to understand how a material could have one con
dition for the commencement of plasticity and an entirely
different one for its existence; perhaps users of these con
ditions tacitly admit the existence of the intermediate stage,
but neglect it for the simplification of calculation and because
the physical difference between the elastic and plastic states
is so great ; or perchance they do not admit the rigour of the
deduction of the plastic law from Tresca's experiments.
[St. Venant's proof (Comptes Rendus, lxx., and Todh. &
Pearson's ' History of Elasticity,' vol. ii. § 2'A6) that in the
plastic stage the resistances to slide (shearing-strain) and
elongation have the same value, consists in equating the work
done in similar changes under a simple shear q and a com

            Ductile Materials under Continued Stress.           79
bined stress +p and —p, and hence showing that <j=p. This
is true in the elastic as well as in the plastic stage ; but the
combined stress +p and —p is merely another view of the
shear, and constitutes a very different condition to a simple
tensional stress, so that St. Venant's final step seems illogical.]
    18. The Maximum Shearing - Stress criterion of Elastic
Strength.—A third theory of elastic strength, mentioned by
Cotterill in his ' Applied Mechanics,' is that the condition of
yielding is the existence of a shearing-stress of a specific
amount. Having regard to the behaviour of the material
when in the plastic stage, the assumption of continuity would
 lead to this theory, but although the shearing-stress law of
the plastic stage has been generally recognized, no formulas
for elastic strength in particular cases have been based upon
a similar law for the yield-point. The knowledge of Tresca's
 results and the observation of the phenomena presented by
 cold bending, tension and compression tests, punching, and
 the general manipulation of metal, must have urged many
 towards the conclusion that this is the true criterion of elastic
 strength in a ductile material.
    19. Further reason*for adopting Thin Tubes as specimens. —
 It has been stated above, that tubular specimens were used in
 this series of experiments. In addition to the reason there
 advanced, I was influenced by the advantage which tests made
 by subjecting the tubes to internal fluid-pressure would have
 in confirming, or not, the various theories. In such tests it is
 evidently an advantage to have the thickness of the tube
 small compared with the radius, as the stress will be more
 uniform, and the yield-point in consequence more sharply
 defined.
    20. Range of Stress covered hi/ different types of experiment.
 —If a specimen of circular section be submitted to torsion
 and tension combined in various ratios, the stresses at the
 exterior may be made to have all combinations between the
 pairs — /*, +/), and 0, +p [throughout I have considered
 tensions and elongations as positive, owing to their more
 frequent occurrence] ; and if compression were substituted for
 tension the range between —p, +p, and —p, 0 would be
 included.     Nothing beyond these, i.e. no like principal
 stresses can be produced by this method ; these, however, can
 be readily impressed on the material of a hollow cylinder by
 the use of fluid pressure. By the combination of tension with
  internal pressure we can extend the range from 0 , +/>, to +p,
  +p ; and by combining external pressure and axial force the
 range from —p, 0 to —p, —p could be covered, but owing to
  the probable instability of a tube of suitable dimensions

 80              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
under these conditions, experiments upon this part of the
 range were deferred.
    21. Method of checking the Isotropism of the Material as
 regards Yield-point Stresses. —This, however, is not the only
 advantage of the internal pressure and tension tests, for by
 their use we can check the isotropism of the material within
the range +ip, p, by having the greater of the stresses first
parallel to the axis and then circumferential : to do this
 within the range 0, + \p it would be necessary to use a com
pressive load and internal pressure, as the longitudinal stress
due to the internal pressure must be added to the longitudinal
stress due to the externally applied load.
    In addition, tests under the combination of internal pressure
and torsion permit the principal axes of the stress to he
inclined at varying angles to the generating lines of the
specimen, and also, if a practical amount of isotropism has
already been demonstrated by the internal pressure and
tension tests, afford a chock upon the general accuracy of the
work by comparing the results of these tests with the results
of experiments involving similar stresses differently applied.
   Torsion tests on thin tubes, it may be noticed, cause a
tendency in the wall to buckle, while the internal-pressure
and tension tests do not.        No buckling occurred in the
experiments.
   Although combined stresses may be produced by simpler
methods, such as the loading of a cranked shaft or of a
helical spring, such methods, since a small portion only of
the material is carried to the yield-point condition, are hardly
likely to furnish decisive results. It is essential for definition,
both because of the elastic-limit effect and because of the small-
ness of the elastic strain, that the whole of the material
directly under observation should be similarly stressed. The
simplest methods of attaining this appeared to me to be those
indicated above, namely, the application of axial loads,
torques and internal pressures, singly or in pairs, to thin-
walled circular tubes. As the production of thin-walled
specimens otherwise than by drawing would be difficult, I
determined to use seamless drawn tubing as specimens, and
to remove the state of set left by the operation of drawing
by annealing.
   22. Objections to Tubes on account of want of Isot ropy. — It. has
frequently been urged that no such material as wires, tubing,
or sheet-metal can be regarded as isotropic ; but I think
such criticism may fairly be met by the consideration that in
the production of ductile materials, operations producing sets
and internal stresses, afterwards removed by annealing, are

              Ductile Materials under Continual Stress.            81
  invariable and essential to the manufacture of a uniform
  material, and that annealing seems usually to remove this
  state of set. In the results of the tests shown, it will appear,
  at any rate so far as the occurrence of the yield-point was
  concerned, that the materials were practically isotropic.
     In the case of experiments upon wires, which after anneal
 ing show a marked want of isotropy, it is probably due to
 overdrawing in the manufacture of the wire, which produces
 a series of conical defects along the wire, the effect of which
 evidently could not be removed by annealing. Unless the
 wire is wanted particularly hard for some special purpose,
 this defect is not likely to occur.
     23. Objection to Tubes on account of large effect of defects. —
 Another objection, which can well be raised to the use of such
 thin-walled tubes as those which I experimented upon, is the
 large effect which would be produced by variations and
 defects in the specimen, especially in the torsion experiments.
 The tubes were all carefully examined before use, and none
 showing visible defects were employed ; the greatest variation
 in external diameter was about 0*005 inch in 1*25 inch. This
 examination was intended, however, merely to avoid the waste
 of time which the testing of an obviously poor specimen would
 involve.
     If any flaw existed in the material, or if the surfaces were
 not close approximations to concentric circular cylinders, the
values of the elastic constants would be considerably changed,
and always to a lower value ; the density of the material
 would be low ; and the stress-strain curve would soon cease
to be straight.
    Now in all the tests measurements of the distortions pro
duced, as well as of the forces applied, were taken. The
moduli of rigidity and extension calculated from those were
never found to be widely different from their customary value,
and especially they are never low in value. (See Table I.)
Also the densities found were high. Furthermore, the stress-
strain curves to within a point not far below the yield-point
were always found to be straight.
    24. The System of Tests.—The method of experimenting em
ployed was, then, to subject the tubes to torque, to torque and
tension combined, to tension only, to tension and internal pres
sure combined, to torsion and internal pressure combined, and
to internal pressure only ; and to take measurements of the
axial elongation, of the twist when torque was employed, and
in some cases of the circumferential strain. The range of
the two principal stresses thus covered was from —p, +p to
+p, +p, the third principal stress being small, or zero.

82             Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
    25. The Specimens and Holders.—The specimens upon
which the tests were made were formed of tubes (steel, copper,
and brass) soldered on to holders, which served conveniently to
apply the tension loads and the torques, and to introduce fluid
under pressure to the interior of the tube. A convenient
size of tube appeared to be 1^ in. diameter, with the walls from
0'025 in. to 0*036 in. in thickness. All measurements of exten
sion and twist were made upon the same length of 8 in., but in
order to provide room for the diametral extensometer which
was sometimes used, and to avoid the disturbing effects of
the holders upon the distribution of stress and strain, the
length of tube free from the holders was a foot. A holder is
shown in fig. 2. A is a screw connecting the holder to the
jaw of the testing machine, it is adjusted so that the forces
applying the torque have no vertical component—the specimen
 being vertical. B is a cross-bar serving to apply or to resist
 the torque. C is a passage-way for the oil used to apply the
internal pressure. In the upper holder, which was the nearer
to the weighing part of the testing machine, the exit was
 closed by a screwed cap ; sometimes a piece of rubber tubing,
 doubled over itself to form a packing, was pushed in ahead of
the closing plug, and proved to bo a very efficient means of
preventing leakage. The exit was not closed until fluid
appeared at it, in the expectation that should a tube prove
unsound, or the pressure get beyond control, no damage would
then be done to the strain-measuring apparatus. The lower
holder was identical with the upper one, except that, in the
 place of the plug, a pipe was brazed into it, there being a
 coupling at the further end of the pipe for connexion with
 the pressure system.
    26. The Tension Loads.—The tension loads were applied
 to the specimen by means of a Ten-ton Wickstead machine of
 the screw type. The shackles of the machine were fitted with
 the ball-thrust, or perhaps pull, bearings shown in fig. 2.
 The " male cone " surfaces C were made spherical in order
that the specimen could line itself up to some extent and cause
the axes of pull and of the specimen to coincide, and yet
allow the specimen freedom to rotate. This action was
assisted by gently tapping the specimen at low loads. The
 method of holding the specimen was by. means of split collars
 D, the screw A of the tube-holder being thrust through the
 spherical cone of the ball-bearing so far as to allow the
collars to be placed round it and inserted into the spherical
 cone. This proved a rapid and easy method of firmly securing
 the specimens. I possessed no conveniences for calibrating
 the testing machine by the direct application of a large dead

           Ductile Materials umler Combined Stress.           83
load, but the travelling poise (500 lbs.) was removed and
 found to be correct, and the distance between the knife-edges
was measured, with the same result. In a few of the tests
there was evidence that the axes of the specimen and of the
pull did not exactly coincide, causing a small bending moment
on the specimen. This tends to produce an effect similar to
that of the elastic limit.
    27. The Application of the Torque.—In order to apply
torque to the specimen, it was placed in the testing machine
and a small load (250 lbs.) placed upon it, to line it up and
steady it. The cross-bars were then placed in the holders
and nipped in position by the set screws E. Steel points F
were then placed in the upper cross-bar, and a pair of screws
in a bracket, bolted to the casting of the testing machine,
were adjusted to just touch the lower cross-bar. Finally,
equal and opposite forces were applied to the steel points
by means of bent pieces of iron, as shown in the left-hand top
corner of fig. 2, attached to belts. These belts were belt
laces, which being thin, flexible, and sufficiently strong,
appeared to be the best means of transmitting round pulleys
such forces as were required. The belts led off horizontally
from the ends of the cross-bar, which was adjusted vertically
by the screw A of the tube-holders, to pullejs, from which
they went vertically downwards to knife-edges fixed in the
ends of a horizontal cross lever, from a knife-edge at the
centre of which hung the carrier for the weights which pro
duced the torque. The effect of the cross lever and weight-
carrier was neutralized by balance-weights hung over the
Eulleys. These pulleys were made by filling the rims of
  icycle wheels with plaster-of-paris, and, before the plaster
had set hard, rotating the wheel in contact with a former,
thus producing a suitable groove true with the axis of rotation.
The torque thus applied to the specimen was practically pure,
and produced no bending moment on the specimen. It was
resisted by the forces produced by the set screws on the lower
cross-bar, there being thus little or no sideways force at the
lower grip.
   28. The Friction of the Torsion Rigging.—A fourth pulley
was used in testing the friction of the torsion apparatus.
The greater part of this friction, when any considerable load
was on the specimen, occurred in the ball-bearings in the
shackles. To ascertain the friction two equal and opposite
torques were applied to the top cross-bar by means of belts
leading over each of four pulleys and terminating in a weight-
carrier. The lower cross-bar was removed. The desired
tension load P was then placed upon the specimen, and
                             G2

84                  Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
approximately equal additional weights placed upon a diago
nally opposite pair of weight-carriers until they descended.
The equal additional weights were placed upon the other pair
of weight-carriers until they in turn descended. The latter
pair of additional weights (shot) were then placed together
and weighed. One quarter of this amount for one of the
weights on the carriers represents the equivalent of the friction
of the system under the load P. Now in this test four
pulleys and the two shackle- bearings rotate, while in the
actual tests three pulleys and one shackle-bearing are rotated,
thus the previous result should be halved for application to the
tests. The two weights on the carriers are, however, com
bined into one hung at the centre of the cross-lever, so that
one quarter of the weighed amount should be taken for the
weight (W) at the centre of the cross-lever. The results of
these friction tests are given in Table I. ; the friction given
is in all cases too high, as, the masses moved being large, a
 small moving force produced a small acceleration which
 required considerable time to make its effect manifest. The
 corrections required for W are so small tliat they have been
 neglected in the calculations of the stresses.

                      Friction of Torsion Apparatus.
   It was found that the friction of the pulleys was so small as to be negligible
 in comparison with the friction of the pull-bearings, the value of W making
little difference.
   Mean values of tfW from several experiments ure given :—
           P                1000         2000        3000         4000

                  Hence SW = 0285 lb. per 1000 lb. value of P.
                  And IW = 0-075 lb. in all cases for the wheels.
    Henoe Friction only amounts to 1J lb. for a load of 5000 lbs.
     29. The Application of the Internal Pressure.—When
 tests involving the application of internal pressure were to be
  made, after a small tensional load had been placed on the
  specimen so as to line it up, the lower end was clamped
  firmly by the other screws, opposite to the first set, in the
  bracket (fig. 4, A). The tube brazed into the lower holder
  was then clamped at two points to the lower cross-bar, and
  finally the tube was coupled to the pressure system. The
  clamps were intended to prevent the production of a bending-
  moment on the specimen ; but in spite of these precautions,
  and although the pipe conveying the pressure was long and

            Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.           85
 thin, evidence of a bending-moment (small, however) was
 evinced in some of the tests.
    This could have been avoided in the tension-internal pres
sure testa by generating the fluid pressure in a reservoir
attached to the specimen, the plunger being connected to the
jaw of the testing machine, thus transmitting the pull and
producing the fluid pressure at the same time. This method
 however, only permits of a certain ratio of fluid pressure
 to tensional load for a given plunger, is inapplicable to tor
sion-internal pressure tests, and is subject to other objections.
Accordingly the former method, despite the risk incurred of
an undesired bending-moment, was adopted.
    Up to 1000 lbs. per sq. in. the pressure was taken from
the system whicli worked the hydraulic straining-gear of an
Emery-Festing machine ; beyond that pressure a small in-
tensifier was employed to further increase the pressure.
    30. Measurement of the Fluid Pressure.—To measure the
pressure I invented a special form of gauge, but although
this proved useful for calibrating purposes, it was replaced
in the tests by a large commercial gauge, which could be
read by means of a telescope from the controlling-valve
of the Emery pressure-system, which valve was at a con
siderable distance from the Wickstead machine. This com
mercial gauge was calibrated by comparison with the volume
of air compressed into a uniform tube by the pressure and
by comparison with the special gauge, the constant of which
was determined at a low load by means of a Crosby gauge-
tester. The air-gauge consisted of a glass tube of about
1 mm. diameter of bore and 1 metre long, sealed hermetically
into a glass bulb holding about 20 c.c. ; below this a tube
projected downwards, and was then bent upwards for con
venience in handling. The capillary tube was selected as
having the most uniform bore of a large number of such
tubes, and was so even as to render correction for conicallity
unnecessary. The bulb of the glass apparatus was contained
in a iron cylinder partially filled with mercury, to the top of
which the oil of the pressure-system had access. The iron
cylinder was closed with a screw plug, through which the
capillary tube projected ; the packing used was of the U-type.
The comparison of the volume of air under pressure with the
reading of the commercial gauge was conducted so slowly
that the changes of volume were practically isothermal.
The volume of the tube and of the bulb, and the quantity of
air contained, had been carefully measured, but a large
quantity of air was syphoned out byr the action of the mercury;
and in preference to running the risk of an unnoticeable

86              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
quantity being syphoned out, the pressure at 300 lbs. per
square inch was determined by the use of a Crosby gauge-
tester, so that this is the ultimate basis of the measurement
of the fluid pressure.
    31. A new type of Pressure-gauge.—The special gauge
 (see fig. 3) consisted of a steel tube of oval section, twisted
along its axis, so that the tube had a straight axis, but the
extremities of the major axes of the sections perpendicular to
 the tube-axis lie on a pair of helices the angle of which
 is about 45° to 60°. One end of the tube is coupled to the
 pressure-system, and the free end is sealed up and a pointer
 or mirror, preferably the latter, mounted upon it. On the
 application of internal pressure the tube untwists, and the
 amount of angular movement is determined by the use of a
 telescope and scale, or in any other manner. As the strain
 at any part is small, it is proportional to the pressure; but the
 integral twist of the mirror or pointer may be made of any
 magnitude we please, without exceeding the elastic limit of
 the metal, by simply increasing the length of the gauge-tube.
 As, by using a tube of suitable thickness, it is easy to keep
  the stresses in the steel, produced by fluid pressures up to
  several thousand pounds per square inch, below the yield-
 point, and since there is no mechanism nor friction, the gauge
 is at once simple and accurate. By comparing the readings
  of two gauges, one having thicker walls than the other, the
 fluid pressure corresponding to the yield-point of the lighter
 gauge can easily be found, as it occurs when the readings
  cease to be proportional. The constant of the heavy pressure-
  gauge may be found by comparing it with the lower gauges.
 Having first ascertained the permissible working pressures,
 a thin-walled gauge may be compared with a mercury
 column, and its constant thus found ; this gauge may then
 be compared with a heavier gauge, and since the constant of
 the first gauge cannot alter, that of the second may bo found.
 Thus the constants of all the gauges can be found. The axis
 of such a gauge-tube can evidently be coiled (as a line) and
  produce other desirable movements.
     The gauge used in the calibration of the commercial gauge
 was made of tubing originally \ inch in diameter ; it was
 about 8 inches long, and from my knowledge of the yield-
  points of thinner-walied gauges I think that its yield-point
  would be reached under a fluid pressure of from 4000 to
  5000 lbs. per square inch.
     In Table II. will be found the comparison of the com
  mercial gauge by the two methods. They give practically
  the same result.

   32. Measurement of the Distortions.—In order to determine
the strains and to locate the points in the various stress-
strain curves, I used instruments which I had devised with a
view to these teste. They were a combined axial extensometer
and twist-meter, and a diametral extensometer used to de
termine the circumferential strain.
   As it seems to be essential that any extensometer to be
used on a part of the stress-strain curve likely to involve a
time-effect should be single-reading, and should not be
required to be manipulated in any way to obtain a reading,
optical methods were used throughout.
   33. A New Extensometer.—It will be convenient to de
scribe the axi.il portion of the apparatus first. It consists of a
lever-system and a mirror; the twist of the latter, produced
by an extension of the specimen in a manner similar to the
Unwin extensometer, being read by a telescope and scale.
The various parts are shown in fig. 4, which is a side-
elevation of the whole instrument in position on a specimen,
the " adjuster " being shown on the left-hand side. The
piece marked 1 is called the adjuster, and serves to adjust
the grips 2 and 3 correctly on the specimen, so that they are
at the correct distance apart, and so that certain points in
their configuration lie on the axis of the specimen. In fig. 5
is shown a view from below the grip 2 in fig. 4, and in the
broken lines is shown a view of the end of the adjuster.
This adjuster consists of surfaces Aj, A2, A3, A4, of which Al
and Ag are parts of one plane, and A2, A4 are parts of another
intersecting it. CD and EF are portions of kinematic slides
for the grips 2 and 3, the other elements of the slides being
formed by the spheres cu c3, d on the grip 2. and e„ eiff on

 the grip 3, which is shown in fig. 7. These are so arranged
 that the axis of the screws G, H, and the line st referred to
 later, will bisect the angle between the planes A1; A, and
 A2) A4, and be perpendicular to their intersection. It is
 evident that by this arrangement the lines GH and st will
 pass through the axis of the specimen (whatever be its size),
 which is necessary for the determination of the mean ex
 tension should the specimen stretch unequally, owing to
 bending-moment or other cause. At B is shown a hole,

90              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
which is at the back of the adjuster, through which a rubber
band is passed to support the adjuster on the specimen while
the grips are being fastened. The spheres c1( c2, d of the
grip 2 are placed in the V-groove G and on the plane D,
and the grip slid along into position and the screws Gr, H
nipped into the specimen ; the screw R is then adjusted to
touch the specimen. The other grip is adjusted in the same
manner, and the adjuster is then withdrawn. It will be seen
that the grips form one piece with the specimen, and during
a test the screw-points are not employed as bearings, the
friction at which would be an unknown variable quantity.
The bottom grip 2 is fitted with a trihedral hole (see fig. 9)
at P, in which lies a steel ball p fastened to the length-bar
5 (fig. 5), the pair forming a universal joint. Similar uni
versal joints are to be seen at U«, Ss, Vv, Br, and Wu:
The length-bar connects the grip 2 with a bent lever 4
 (fig. 8), which rests on the top grip 3; the length-bar being
connected to the lever by the universal joint Uw, and the
lever being kinematically hinged to the top grip by the
universal joint Ss and a sphere t working in a V-groove T.
The axis of the screws L, M intersects and bisects the line st,
 and the grip 2 is so adjusted that the point of intersection is
 on the axis of the specimen. To the other end of the lever
 is connected, by the universal joint V«, the mirror-bar 6
 (figs. 4 & 9), to which the mirror-frame, 7, is hinged
 kinematically by the universal joint Ww and the V-groove
and sphere Xa\ The mirror-frame 7 (figs. 4 & 7) is
 finally connected to the lower grip, 2, by the universal joint
 Rr, the sphere R being carriedon the end of the calibrating-
 screw Q. In addition to the restraints mentioned, the mirror-
 bar has a wing, r, which is in contact with the (blunt) end of
 a screw Z, being kept in contact by the small weighted
 lever Y. Any extension of the specimen will result in
 an angular movement of the lever 4, thus raising the axis of
 the hinge WX, and causing the mirror to rotate about this
 axis. It will be noticed that the forces along all the members
 of the instrument are practically unaffected by the movements
 of the parts, being controlled by the position of the adjustable
 weight shown on the mirror-frame. The mirror is readily
 adjusted, so that the reflexion of the scale appears in the
 field of view of the telescope by means of the screw Z, which
 turns the mirror about a vertical axis, while the scale-reading
 can be adjusted to zero by means of the screw Q. This
 screw also serves, in case it should bo desired to push
 the investigations beyond the yield-point, to readjust the
 reading on to the scale as often as desired, and also to

            Ductile Materials under Combined St rets.        91
ascertain directly the value of a scale-division in terms of
the axial strain. To do this the change of scale-reading
caused by one or more turns of the screw, the head of which
is graduated and the pitch of which is known ; then, by
taking account of the multiplication by the levers and of the
length of the specimen, the axial strain per scale-division is
easily found. The screw Q was compared directly with a
 Brown and Sharpe micrometer, and the two were found to
 agree to the ^^ inch in eight turns or 0-2 inch. A con
 sideration of the behaviour of the instrument under the
 supposition that the specimen bends or twists will show that
 these do not affect the reading, which will always represent
 the mean axial elongation. Une kinematic restraint, it will
 be noticed, is wanting : this, however, would be supplied by
a wing attached to the length-bar and arrangements similar to
 YZ, but would have no effect on the working of the instru
 ment ; it is therefore omitted. Figs, 5, 6, 7, 8, and tl
 represent parts of the extensometer : fig. 6 being the top
grip, 7 the lever, 8 a trihedral hole, and 9 a side-view and
sectional plan of the mirror and its supports, on a rather
larger scale than the other parts.
   The instrument proved sensitive and trustworthy ; the tests
of it for sensitiveness made on the Norweginn iron specimen
previously referred to are given in Table IV. The scale was
placed at such a distance that the extension in 8 inches
corresponding to one scale-division was about the one hundred
thousandth of an inch ; the nearest scale-division is recorded,
except when the cross-hair of the telescope was apparently
midway between two divisions.
   34. Errors of Extensometer.—In a figure formed by
[)lotting out Table IV. it can be noticed that the hysteresis-
 oop, due to the yield-point having been reached previously,
is well marked, and its width is considerably greater than the
instrumental error ; the errors, which are quite insignificant,
are about the value of one scale-division, and include any
error due to the want of sensibility of the testing-machine.
   35. A Ifetc Twist-measuring Apparatus.—The apparatus
for measuring the twist consisted merely of a pair of mirrors
mounted on the grips 2 and 3, a scale placed horizontally
being read by light reflected at each of the mirrors. Two
arrangements occurred to me : one in which the mirrors had
their normals perpendicular to the axis of the specimen (see
fig. 12), and one in which they were inclined at 45° or so
(see figs. 10 & 11). In these figures the course of the ray
of light is indicated roughly by the broken line, the scale

 92              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
 being shown at the right-hand side, and the telescope or
source of light being upon the left. The amount of twist of
 the specimen is determined by observing the change of
 reading of the scale by means of a telescope, the scale being
 observed by reflexion at both of the mirrors.
    The second was the method selected, it being easily appli
 cable to specimens of varying lengths.
    The mirrors are mounted upon frames resting upon the
 spheres cu c3t d ; <?1? e.,, f of the grips, which are left vacant
 by the withdrawal of the adjuster. The two frames are
 exactly similar. The angle <\, c2, d is a right angle ; the
 contact of the frame with cu b is made by means of a tri
 hedral hole mounted on a screw, with c2 by means of a fixed
 V-groove, and with d by means of a plane at the end of a
 screw. The normals to the mirrors can be adjusted within
 certain limits by the use of these screws. The various surfaces
 are kept in contact by the use of the springs shown in
fig. 4.
    Had the other method been adopted, one or both mirrors
would have had to have been mounted upon sliding bars so
that they could have been adjusted opposite to one another,
when the grips (for torsion purposes) were placed at various
distances apart. No special adjustment, however, would
have been required to secure accuracy.
    If, in the inclined mirror case, we consider the lower grip
stationary and the top mirror alone to twist, it is very evident
that the twist of the upper mirror is the same as the angle
through which the reflexion of the optical axis of the reading-
 telescope is turned, and is therefore, to the second order of
small quantities, equal to the change of scale-reading divided
by the distance from the telescope to the scale. The lower
grip, however, must be allowed to twist in order that the
stress in the specimen between the grips may be of the
 normal type, uninfluenced by the proximity of the holders ;
in the following investigation it will be shown that, wh,en
a certain adjustment is made, the scale-reading divided by the
distance from the specimen to the scale is equal to the twist
of the specimen between the grips, at any rate as closely as
the tangent of the angle is equal to the angle.
   36. Proof that the Torsion-Mirrors measure the Twist.—
The light from the scale first strikes the upper mirror,
and is thence reflected on to the lower mirror, where
by it is reflected to the telescope. In order, however, to
ascertain the effect of a simultaneous twist of the two grips,
we shall take the line in the reverse direction, and consider
the optical axis of the telescope and the direction of its

    Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.                     93

  reflexions at each of the minors. The distance between the
 mirrors will be neglected, as it should be small compared
 with the distance from the specimen to the scale, or else a
  lens should be placed between the top mirror and the scale to
  render the light proceeding from the latter parallel. In the
 apparatus as rigged for the tests, the distance between the
 mirrors was 2 or 3 inches, and the distance to the scale over
  200, so that this condition was satisfied.

      across the image of the scale through an angle Sz or
      S(2dx — ff2 + a). This remains constant, so that the movement
      Across the scale due to twist of the specimen is verv small.

  Now in the use of this instrument fa2 is of a larger order than
  any of the other quantities, but if the other quantities fa, 0,,
  do, and a are all zero, it is evident that <f> and fa are exactly
  equal.

 Then the ray lies in the plane COA, and

                      -f+ft-(j-*) + -,
     Hence if we make the reflexion of the optical axis in the
 first mirror parallel to the axis of the telescope, the value
 of <£ becomes fa— fa, or the scale-reading divided by the
 distance to the scale is the twist between the mirrors to
 the orders of small quantities stated above. This adjustment
 is made by the use of the adjusting-screws of the lower
 mirror, the telescope being sighted so as to have the lower
 mirror at (he centre of its field, and then the mirror adjusted
 so that a point similarly situated with respect to the specimen
 as the centre of the lower mirror appears at the centre of
 the field.
    The adjustment was tested by turning the specimen as a
 whole through an angle of O'l, when it was found that the
 scale-reading changed through an angle corresponding usually
 to about 0-001.
    The greatest value of ^3 was about 0"05, the cube of which
is 0-000125 ; the corresponding value of fa would be about
one-eighth of fa or 0-006, and fa* would be 0-00004. The
error of $ would hence be about 0-25 per cent., which is
quite negligible.
    It will be noticed that azimuthal errors in the settings of
the mirrors are of no effect, being parts of fa and fa, changes
of which alone affect the value of fa
    37. The Effect of Bending.— Unfortunately, the effect of

been practically completed ; otherwise the alternative arrange
ment of the twist-mirrors, which is free from such defects,
would probably have been preferred although not readily
applicable to specimens of different lengths.
   Bending in a plane through the telescope and specimen has
the effect of causing the image of the scale to move vertically
across the field of the telescope, but it does not affect the
reading.
   Bending in a plane at right angles to this, however, has an
effect upon the reading. If irenngle CAP = ^rand POA=^>
we have
                        cos 6= sin x cos -^r,
                       tan <f> = tan % sin yfr,
and bending alters the value of yfr, so that the effect of
bending is to produce
                g^sinj^mt fc^o nearly.
                         sin 0      T           J
               8<j> =       sX"^ S\fr = b\fr nearly.
 So that the bending is added to the twist.
    In the tests, however, a small load (250 lbs.) having been
 placed on the specimen, the bearings were tapped until the
 alignment had taken place. In pure torsion tests then the
 bending could have had no effect; and in the combined tests,
 as the torsion load was applied first and then the axial load, if
 the latter produced any bending it would alter the reading of
 the twist. On only one occasion was this of any magnitude,
 and usually the reading remained nearly constant until the
 yield-point was reached, when it increased. I therefore do
 not think that the source of error indicated above had an
 appreciable effect on the twist readings.
    38. As a Transmission Dynamometer.—It may be noticed
 that in the case where the normals to the mirrors are perpen
 dicular to the specimen, the reflected optical axis is turned
 through twice the angle the specimen twists through, and
 this relationship is exact. By using a ray of light of small
 cross section and allowing it, after reflexion at the two
 mirrors, to fall upon a scale, its position will indicate the
 twist between the mirrors ; and since the reading can be
  taken when the light is intermittent, the device forms a cheap
  and convenient form of transmission dynamometer.
    39. The Diametral Extensometer.—The diametral extenso-
  meter (fig. 14, p. 93) consists of a piece 1 resting in contact
  with the specimen at the surfaces A B 0 D forming parallel V's

            Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.         101
(as in the Adjuster) ; to this was hinged by an axis resting in
two Vs E, F, and a point at the end of the axis resting on
a surface G, a lever 2. The lever 2 has a projection H
which was kept in contact with the tube by a spring K. The
piece 1 also carried the V-bearings L, M of a mirror-frame
.'$, the axis of the bearings being perpendicular to the axis of
the specimen. The mirror-frame was connected to a screw
working in the lever 2 by means of a link 4 ; the link having
sharp knife-edges of V-forin which worked on knife-edges
on the screw and mirror-frame. The instrument was sup
ported partly by springs, and partly by the friction at the
surface of the tube. The distance of the knife-edge N
 fastened to the mirror-frame, and upon which the link 4
 worked, being small, its distance from the axis of rotation of
 the mirror-frame was determined by clamping the piece 1
and a micrometer-screw in such a way that turning the
screw pushed, by means of a small distance-piece, the knife-
edge through a definite amount. The twist of the mirror
 was then determined optically. The amount of the strain
 corresponding to any twist of the mirror can then be easily
 calculated ; it being remembered that, owing to the use of
 V's for the tube to rest in, the movement of H relative to the
 piece 1 is not simply the increase of the diameter, but is to
 be considered as the effect of an enlargement of the tube. If
 a is the semi-angle of the V's, the distance from the point of
 the V to the point of contact of the lever is r(l + coseca),
 where r is the radius of the tube. Hence an increase of
 radius Br corresponds to a movement of the lever at the point
of contact with the tube of 6V(1 + cosec a).
     40. Method of makimj the Tests.—In making the tests, a
lube, after its dimensions had been determined, was soldered
on to the holders and then placed in the testing-machine, and a
 load of 250 lbs. applied, and the shackle-bearings tapped in
order to make the specimen line itself up as accurately as
possible. This load of 250 lbs. was employed as it pulled
into contact the surface of the lower head of the testing-
machine, which would not be in contact permanently until
the load on the specimen exceeded the weight of all the parts
 lietween it and the straining-gear of the machine. [There
 was also a slight amount of backlash in the nut of the screw.]
The torsion-bars and steel points were placed in their positions,
and the screws in the bracket adjusted to just touch the lower
 cross-bar. The grips of the extensometer were then fixed to
 the specimen by the use of the adjuster, and the lower torsion-
 mirror applied. The telescope for the torsion-tests was then
 adjusted opposite the lower mirror with its optical axis hori
 zontal, and the lower mirror was adjusted by the screws in

i02             Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
its frame until the reflexion of the optical axis was parallel to
the specimen. The top mirror was then fixed to the top grip
and the torsion-scale placed at the same level : the screws of
the top mirror were then adjusted until the image of the scale
appeared horizontal and at the centre of the field. The scale
was then moved horizontally until the reading was nearly
zero, the final adjustment to zero being made just before a
test by the azimuth-screw of the telescope. The adjustment
of the mirrors is such as to satisfy the condition found above
 (§ 36) for the vanishing of the terms of the second order in the
expansion of the twist. The remaining parts of the extenso-
meter were then placed in position, and the scale for axial
 extensions being moved so that its centre was opposite the
mirror, the second screw Q was used to adjust the reading to
nearly zero, the final adjustment being made by the altitude-
screw of the corresponding telescope. The diametral extenso-
 meter was then adjusted on the specimen, above the other and
 strain apparatus.
    The various forces were applied by suitable increments,
 and readings of the extensometer taken at each application :
 the time-effect at the elastic limit was looked for, and at its
appearance the forces were applied by smaller amounts until
 it was judged that the yield-point had been reached. In tests
involving tension and torsion the torque was applied first ;
 during the application of the tension-load the first reading
 seldom changed appreciably, though it usually changed a few
divisions. On only one occasion was the change (indicating
 a bending-moment) considerable. In all tests involving in
 ternal pressure, the pressure was applied last, as it was some
 what difficult to keep it constant at a desired amount. In the
 Tables the tension-loads are denominated by the letter P, and
 expressed in pounds-weight ; the loads producing torque by
 W, so that the torques are 1 5 W inch-lbs., the cross-bar
 being 30 inches long between the points ; the fluid pressure
 as recorded by the gauge by p0, the corresponding pressure
  being obtained from the table of gauge corrections. The
  reading of the axial extensometer is called the axial reading,
  the factor to reduce this is changed in the course of the tests;
  otherwise all scales were placed at standard distances. This
  factor was 0-000001286 for tubes I., II., III., X., XL, XII.,
  XIII., and 0-000001265 for the remainder. The reading to
  determine the twist is called the twist-reading; the factor to
  reduce it to shearing-strain or slide varies with the diameter
  of the tube, for a 1^-inch diameter tube it is 0-00000377. The
  diametral extensometer readings have not been tabulated, it
  having been deemed more reliable to deduce the strain from
  the elastic constants ; the factor to reduce scale-readings to

              Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.         103
  strains was 0000002022 for a l£-inch diameter tube. Ex
  amples of the results of this extensometer will be found plotted
  in some of the stress-strain curves (figs. 21, 23, & 24).
     The values of P, W, po, the axial and the twist readings
 for the yield-point in the various teste are tabulated in Tables
 VI., VII., and VIII. under the head of observations.
     41". Determination of the Sectional Area and Thickness of
tlie Tidies.—The external diameter of the specimens was
determined by the use of a micrometer-caliper ; they were
all practically uniform. The thickness was determined in
every case by calipering, and also indirectly from the area of
cross-section. The cross-section was determined in cases
 I., III., X., XL, XII., and XIII. by weighing the tubes in
air and in water, the tubes being well boiled in the water,
and the specific gravity of the water at the temperature
checked. The density as well as the cross-section was thus
determined. The other tubes were weighed and the thickness
deduced from the result : as it always closely agreed with the
makers' statement and with the result of direct measure
ment, the values may be regarded as fairly close. It should
be noticed that errors in the thickness will only very slightly
affevt the relative results of the tests upon a tube, as the
change in the mean diameter is the only way by which the
relative results would be affected.
    42. Calculation of the Stresses.—The effect of an axial force
P is to produce a stress p, equal to the force divided by the
area of the specimen : the values of these stresses for the
various experiments are tabulated in the column headed p.
    Owing to the smallness of the friction at the bearings, it
has not been thought necessary to allow for it in the value
of W; the cases which it affects most are those in which P is
large and W comparatively small, the friction being practically
proportional to P. The effect of a torque 15 W is to produce
a shearing-stress </ in the material of the tube varying from
the inner surface to the outer proportionally to the distance
from the axis. As the thickness of the tube is only from 0'04
to 0'06 of the radius, the variation of the shearing-stress from
its mean value is only 2 or 3 per cent. The value of q is
taken as equal to the torque divided by the product of the
area of section and the mean radius. A simple shearing-
stress </ is equivalent to two principal stresses +q and — q.
It is to be noticed that neither tension, torsion, nor their
combination produces a third principal stress.
    The effect of the fluid pressure is to produce an axial
stress pi and a circumferential stress whose mean value is 2/>i,

where ri v, = — area — X fluid pressure
                                 r          ; and a radial stress
varying from the value of the fluid pressure at the interior
surface to zero at the exterior surface.
   Since in a cylinder under internal pressure the circum
ferential stress is given by the equation />=Cll+^j),
where r0 is the external radius and r the radius at which the
stress is p, the circumferential stress at the interior bears to
                                   (fr? \                 t
                                      1 + -.—=-7., 1= 1 + - nearly.
Hence the variation from the mean value is about 2 or 3 per
cent., as in the case of the shearing-stress due to torque.
    In the calculations the mean values of the radius have been
used, and no notice taken of the variation of the stress. In
the hydraulic tests the actual amount of variation in pounds
per sq. inch is equal to the value of the fluid pressure, since
the sum of the radial and circumferential stresses is the same
throughout the material of the cylinder.
   The value of the axial stress due to the fluid pressure at
the yield-point in the test is tabulated in the column headed
pi. In the case of a simultaneous tension-load producing an
additional stress p0, this is simply added on, so that the
principal stresses are then p+pi axially, 2pi circumferentially,
and $p0 radially.
    To find the principal stresses when torsion is combined with
tension or internal pressure, notice first that the radial stress
is always perpendicular to the other components and to the
plane of the shear, and hence it is a principal stress, and the
 case reduces to one of two dimensions and the stress ellipsoid

 where pu pa are the component axial and circumferential
 stresses and a the shearing-stress. The principal stresses ct„

   In the tables of results the next column contains the
maximum shearing-stress ; this takes place in a plane per
pendicular to the axis of mean principal stress, and is that of
the plane through the mean axis bisecting the angles between
the other principal stresses: its value is half the difference be
tween the greatest and least principal stresses. It will be noticed
in the case of those experiments in which the stresses in the
tangential plane are of opposite signs, that this tangential
plane is the plane of the greatest shear, but that in the
other cases the plane passes through the axis of the
tube. The value of the maximum sheariug-stress in cases
involving torsion is, from the value of the principal stresses,
   43. Calculation of the Strains.— Owing to the elastic-
limit effect the measured strains vary more than the stresses,
especially as the elastic-limit effect is practically absent in a
test when the immediately preceding test is of the same type.
   In the simple torsion teste the value of the shearing-strain
or slide <f> is obtained directly from the reading by the use of
the factor. If i be the angle of twist of the specimen in a
length /, /• the radius of the specimen, d the distance to the
scale, measured in the same units as x the scale-reading, we
have
                                 r . r .c
                           *=lt==ld'
 The principal component strains which produce the slide a\
 are Vi = kf\ Vi=—%4>\ and ij,=0.
    The effect of an axial stress is not only to produce an axial
 strain, but to produce a uniform strain of the opposite sign
 in all directions at right angles to it, and bearing to it, in
 amount, the value of Poisson's ratio (a). The value of the
 axial strain was determined from the corresponding scale-
 reading by the use of a factor ; the value of the resulting
 contractile strain was obtained by multiplying this by the
 value of a deduced from the values of E and C for the speci
 men, in preference to using the results of the diametral
 extensometer.
    In the combined tension and torsion tests, the value of the
 principal strains was obtained from the observed value of the
 axial strain ex and of the slide <f>, and by taking the value of
 the circumferential strain as — vet. Since ff> is the only slide
 the strain ellipsoid becomes
                      e1x2+ ejt/2 + e822 + <f>xy= 1,
 w here e2 and e3 are the strains perpendicular to Cj.           The

 The maximum shear-strain, being the difference between the
 greatest and least principal stresses, is
     In the ease of the internal pressure experiments, the strains
 have been calculated from the values of the principal stresses
and of the elastic constants. The results so obtained are always
less than the measured values of the strains would be ; as in
 the tension and internal pressure the axial strain is a principal
one, its measured volume in the column " Axial strain " can
be compared with its calculated value in the column rj1 of the
 principal strains.
    The maximum slides or shear-strains, being in value equal
to the difference between the greatest and least principal strains,
have also been tabulated ; these should be, but for the elastic-
limit effect, directly proportional to the maximum shearing-
stresses, and independent of the third stress.
    44. Maximum Shear and Slide are proportional.—For if
the principal stresses be •B7i,w2,sr3, then the maximum shearing-
stress perpendicular to m3 is \(^\— ¦srj). The principal strains
areg fa—a-nr* — aia3), ^ (¦sr2 — a«r3— cwj), ^ (13-3 — a^ — o-bt^ ,
and the corresponding maximum slide to i(ci            -oj) is ~r-
 x (w,— •cjj). So that the maximum slide directly corresponds
to the maximum shearing-stress and is independent of the
stress normal to its plane. Thus the comparison of the
maximum shear and slide columns in the tables of results
will indicate the magnitude of the elastic-limit effect.
  • 4.r). Quantities tabulated.—Thus for the tests the values of
the principal stresses, of the principal strains, of the maximum
shear, and the maximum slide at the yield-point have been
tabulated ; a column has also been included giving the maxi
mum principal strain as calculated from the elastic constants
and stresses, this being the yield-point strain on the supposition
that Hooko's law holds up to the yield-point.
    The values of E, Young's modulus, and C, the modulus of
rigidity, have been calculated from the elastic ratio of stress
and strain in the tension and torsion experiments ; they have

             Ductile Materials under Combined Stress-.        107
slight variations for the same tube. The value of a, Poisson's
ratio, has been deduced from these by the formula <r= ap_™ »
which is a method evidently liable to large errors ; these,
however, I do not think are serious enough to affect the
conclusions I have drawn from the tables of results, as the
chief conclusions are deduced from the stresses. I had
intended to deduce the value of a directly from the internal
pressure tests ; the axial elongation due to a pressure />0,
 producing stresses />i and 2j>u being yt(l — 2<r), so that
              E
 o- = 0"5 — jt-- x (axial strain).  The method of attaching the
 tube conveying the oil to the specimen was not perfect, and
 seemed to tilt, the tube slightly' as a whole, so that this
 method was not used. Perhaps Regnault's method would
  have been most appropriate.
      The results of the experiments are given in Tables V. (Solid
  Bars), VI. (Steel Tubes), VII. (Copper Tubes), and VIII.
  (Brass Tubes), where the observations made at the yield-
  point and the results will be found.
      4(5. Results of the Experiments.—For the more ready
  presentation of the results of the experiments, diagrams of
  various types have been drawn, and will be described as
  referred to.
       The Tests on Solid Bars.—In the case of the solid-bar
   tests it will be observed that the yield-point stresses (see
  Table V.) rise as the course of tests proceeds: this indicates
   that the yield-point of the outer layers must have been much
   exceeded (§ 5). A glance at the torque-twist diagram
   (fig. 15) for the torsion-tests will clearly demonstrate the
   difficulty of locating the yield-point ; though the tables
   merely embody my estimations of its occurrence, the curves
   at any rate represent actual occurrences, and permit of the
   ready comparison of points considered to correspond. The
   results may be held, with previous torsion experiments, to
    disprove the maximum-stress theory, as the ratios of the
    maximum stresses in the torque and tension tests are 0*615
    to O'Gy for the iron, and 0"565 for the steel. They are also
    at variance with the maximum-strain tbeory, the values of
    the ratio lor the experimental values of a being 0"75 and 0"71
    respectively. In this and some of the succeeding figures the
    time-effect is shown by observations giving different strains
    under a constant stress; the first observations were taken
    immediately the loads were applied ; in some cases the
    intervals of time are given.

116             Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
   47. The Material and Shape of Tubes satisfactory.—Turning
now to the results of the tube-tests, reference to Table IV. will
show that the densities found were high, and that the values of
the moduli of elasticity are usual values for the various
materials, and certainly not low ; also inspection of various
stress-strain diagrams indicates that the relation is linear up
to a considerable fraction of the yield-point stress. For these
reasons the tubes may be taken as of sufficient excellence in
material and shape to afford results worthy of consideration.
   Few torsion-internal pressure experiments have been per
formed, but a comparison of results obtained thus with the
results of those tests when somewhat similar stresses are
differently produced, will tend to cause confidence in the
experiments. The torsion-internal pressure tests are Nos. IV.
5, V. 7, VII. 4, X. 9, and XII. 12.
   48. The Elastic - limit Phenomenon.—The elastic -limit
phenomenon, it will be observed, is much decreased in a
repetition of a test, the observed strain at the yield-point
being less in the second test than in the first, although the
stress-strain curves within the elastic limit practically coincide.
To illustrate this point some of the tests bearing upon it have
been plotted out observation by observation ; in figs. 16 and
17 are two sets of tension tests, and in fig. 18 some torsion
tests.
   When, however, a test imposes upon the material stresses
of a different type to those of the preceding test, the elastic-
limit effect, which may have temporarily disappeared owing to
the similarity of the two preceding tests, is displayed to the
full.
   Copper seems, however, to harden so much under successive
tests, that the strains appear as a whole to lessen with the
amount of treatment.
   The elastic-limit effect also increases with the numl>er of
times different stresses have been applied to the material, as
may be soon by comparing the stress-strain curves for tests of
the same type, but separated by a number of other tests.
Examples are represented in figs. It! (tension) and 18
(torsion) .
   This phenomenon may indicate that the cause of failure
under comparatively low varying stresses, such as employed
by AVohler in his experiments, is due to gradual increase of
size of defects, initially very small ; and 1 think tends to show
that the elastic-limit phenomenon is due to the occurrence of
 the yield-point over small localities.

120              Mr. J. J. Guest on the Strength of
   49. Yield-point Stresses of same type nearly constant
throughout series o?i each tube. —It is to be noted that through
out a series of tests on any tube the yield-point stress never
having been much exceeded, it has nearly the same value in
tests of the same type, though a series of similar tests tend to
cause it to rise.
   50. The Variation of the Maximum Stress. —Proceeding
now to a consideration of the variations of the maximum
principal stress, of the maximum principal strain, and of the
maximum shearing-stress at the yield-points of the different
tests, we find that the first-mentioned varies very largely, its
least value being found in the pure torsion tests, while in the
tests by tension and internal pressure its value is practically
constant, and is the same whether the greater of the principal
stresses is axial or circumferential. The experiments on
Tubes VII. and VIII. show the latter emphatically. We
hence conclude, firstly, that in the case of two tensions (such
as in a boiler) the lesser tension does not appreciably affect
the yield-point; and, secondly, by the similarity of the yield-
 point stress, whether the greater tension be axial or circum
ferential, that the material is practically isotropic in respect
to the occurrence of the yield-point,—at any rate as regards
the tangent-plane stresses, with which we are most concerned.
   51. Variation of the Maximum Principal Strain.—The
maximum strain at the yield-point varies throughout
the experiments : it is greatest in the simple tension
experiments, and least either in the torsion tests or when the
axial and circumferential tensions are equal. Both the strain
as measured (where the axial stress is greatest) anil as calcu
lated from the stresses and elastic constants (and so not including
the elastic-limit effect) are tabulated and can be compared ;
the calculated maximum strain is sometimes radial and
negative. The variations of the maximum strain from con
stancy are considerable for all the materials experimented
upon.
   52. The Maximum Shearing-Stress or Slide nearly constant.
—The maximum shearing-stress developed, and the corre
sponding maximum shearing-strain or slide (which are quan
tities directly proportional and independent of the intermediate
principal stress within the elastic limit) are comparatively-
constant, although the amount is highest in the case of pure
torsion and diminishes towards the tension case. It will be
remembered that the plane of the maximum shear changes
from being a tangential plane of the specimen in the torsion-
tension eases to a plane intersecting the axis of the specimen
in the tension-internal pressure tests.

           Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.           121
   The stresses at the elastic limit have been considered in
several cases, and have been found to follow the same varia
tions approximately.
   53. Graphical presentation of Variations.—The tables and
figures may be held to prove, in the case of the materials
experimented upon—steel, copper and brass—that to a first
approximation the shearing-stress is constant whenever the
third principal stress is zero, or whenever the lesser principal
stress is zero or small.
   It can readily be found by trial that no other simple rela
tion between the stresses or strains is approximately constant.
   The results of the series of tests upon steel, with the excep
tion of the unannealed specimens, are shown in fig. 19, which
has been constructed as follows : —Ox is the axis of principal
stress most nearly coinciding with the generators, and the
abscissaj represent the relative values of the stresses in the
various experiments, a mean axial yield-point stress being
selected as the basis of the scale and marked 10. lielative
values of the other principal stresses were then set off parallel
to Oy and Or, those parallel to Oy being the mean, and those
parallel to Oz being the minimum principal stress.            The
paper should be now considered as folded at a right-angle
along the line Ox; and the observations recorded in the
quadrant zox to lie actually on the paper, while those plotted
in the quadrant soy, though nearly in the plane of the paper,
should correctly be considered as projected by lines parallel
to Oz on to a plane through Ox inclined to the plane xoy at
an angle whose tangent is naif the ratio of the internal pressure
to the circumferential stress it produces. The value of the
angle is about tan-1 0'0225, so that the points may be regarded
as practically in the plane of the paper.
    On the paper are drawn the linos BAC, I3D representing
 the locus of the points had the maximum stress been true ;
the lines GAH, KAL, MAN, representing the locus had the
maximum strain- law been true, and a had the values 0'5,
0"25, and 0 356 respectively, the latter being the mean ex
perimental value. The constant shearing-stress law locus is
the line EFABD, and it will be seen to what extent this
agrees with the mean distribution of the observations. No
movement of the other lines parallel to themselves can pro
duce any approximation to the mean of the actual distribution.
    It must, however, be remembered, while inspecting this
 figure, that this method of setting out the points was adopted
as being just to any theory of strength ; had a mean basis
 been adopted the points could have followed the shearing-
 stress law much more closely.

            Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.                   123
   54. Conclusions probable for general type of Stress.—Con
sidering the three-dimensional view (fig. 20, p. 93), if the
sbearing-stress law were true the observations plotted in space
between Ox, Oy, Oz, or two tensions and a third stress, would
fall upon the two planes, EAB, EDB. We have in our
experiments investigated such combinations of stresses as
give rise to half the line AE, i. e. to FA, to AB, and to BD'
which is half BD.
   Now a similar figure may be drawn for the strains, and
since the traces on the planes %=0 and % = 0 in such a
figure are straight lines, and since the strains are so small
that no quadratic or higher power can have appreciable
effect, except in the improbable case of their coefficients
being extremely large, the function representing this relation
is linear. Since by experiment the value of the intermediate
strain has no effect on the yield-point relation, the coefficient
of i7S in the linear relation is zero. The linear relation there
fore reduces to the equation of the line AE (or the plane
AEB).        This line, as determined by experiment, being
equally inclined to the axes, the corresponding relation is
that the shearing stress or strain is constant.
   55. Effect of a Uniform Volumetric Stress.—In order to
ascertain the relationship of the stresses at the yield-point
more accurately, sequences of tests in which torsion and
tension combined in various amounts should be compared,
 and the inclination of the line AE more accurately deter
mined. From this point of view a direct compression-test
would be of much assistance. Now the linear relation may
be written
                     ¦STj — CTo -f- X («Jj + ^2) == C,
 since this contains two independent constants.                   Putting
 w2=0 we get the case of tension only and the yield-point
 stress from the equation is .— -r-. Putting vr2=— •ar1 we get
 the case of pure torsion, and the yield-point stress is then £C.
 The mean of the experimental results gives for the ratio of
 these yield-point stresses the value 0"52, for which the value
 of X is 0-04 ; and the relation becomes
                    ¦or, — 13-2 + 0-04 (in-, + OT2) = <j0,
 where </0 is the value of the yield-point shearing-stress in
 pure torsion.
    56. Convenient view of general type of Stress.— Since the
 stress ellipsoid ct1.k2 + ict2i(/? + ct3c2 = 1, where wlf rav>, th3 are in

124             Mr. J. J. Guest on llie Strength of
descending order of magnitude, may be written in the form
(since the invariants aro the same"), it is clear that any state
of stress can be represented by the coexistence of a shearing-
stress, a volumetric uniform stress, and a stress perpendicular
to the plane of the shear ; and the yield-point occurs when
the shearing-force together with a small fraction of the volu
metric stress reaches a certain amount : the volumetric stress
being reckoned positive when tensile.
   That the coefficient of the volumetric stress for steel is
small has been shown by these tests, and that it lias some
value greater than zero seems probable, as volumetric tension
would ultimately reduce the material to the liquid or gaseous
form and cause the necessary shear to evanesce. No value
can be directly deduced from such considerations owing to
lack of knowledge of ultimate molecular action. It may be
noted that Bauschinger's experiments on the yield-point in
tension and compression, in which the effect of X. would be
most marked, would point to zero as its value.
   57. The Copper and Urass Texts, and Diagrams.— In the
case of the copper and brass tests the yield-point is more
difficult to locate ; the shearing-stress law still appears to be
that one of the simple laws nearest to the truth. Taking into
account the volumetric stress effect, the coefficient X is larger
than in the case of steel, but so few tests have been made that
conclusions should be drawn with hesitation, especially as the
yield-point stress tends to rise with the successive tests.
   In the copper tests the yield-points were very indefinite,
and 1 have plotted out types of the unusual tests from which
the stresses and resulting strains and the mode of their varia
tion can be seen at a glance, and their values at points con
sidered to correspond to the elastic limit or yield-point in the
various tests readily compared. These curves are given in
tigs. 21-24.
   In fig. 21 is shown a test under internal pressure only, the
stresses parallel to the axis being one-half of the simultaneous
circumferential stresses; the values of the internal pressure
are laid off along the central line, and the values of the
corresponding axial and circumferential strains given on the
right and left hand respectively of the figure. The readings
of the axial and diametral (tig. 14, p. 9.'5) extensometers are
given along the base line, and the corresponding strains along
the top of the diagram. The axial strain is laid off positively
(extension) towards the right, and the circumferential strain
(from the diametral extensometer) positively towards the left.

             Ductile Materials under Combined Stress.           129
    Fig. 22 represents a combined^tension and internal pressure
 test ; the tension load was applied first, the actual loads being
marked along the central line and the corresponding stresses
along the right-hand side line of the figure. The axial strains
are positive and are set off to the right of the central lino : the
circumferential strains (diametral extensometer) are set off
positively to the left of the central line, but during the appli
cation of the tension loads this strain is negative, and the
stress-strain line therefore bears to the right. After a load of
 900 lbs., actual, was reached, the tension load was kept con
stant and the internal pressure applied; the values are marked
off along the central line, the resulting circumferential stresses
are given on the left-hand, and the total, axial stresses on the
right-hand of the diagram. Along the line of no internal
pressure are given the actual extensometer readings, the
corresponding strains being placed at the top.
    Fig. 23 represents a combined tension and torsion test ;
the torque was applied first, and the values of W are set off
along the central line and the corresponding stresses on the
right-hand side of the diagram. The shearing-strains or
slides are set off to the right of the central line. After W
had reached the value of 25 lbs., it was kept constant
and the tension-loads applied ; it will be noticed that the
initial tension-load was 150 lbs. The actual tension loads
are recorded along the central line, and the corresponding
stresses on the left-hand side ; the resulting axial strains are
positive to the left of the central line. The principal strains
at any point cannot be determined at once from the diagram
without a construction or calculation. The addition of a
tension load should not change the twist (slide) reading, unless
the elastic limit has been passed ; the slight inclination of
this part of the line may be due to a bending-moment, or to a
slight want of isotropy introduced by the previous tests.
   Fig. 24 is a similar diagram for a torque and internal-
pressure test, and can be readily understood from its similarity
to the preceding figures.
   All these figures, and the corresponding ones for simple
tension and torsion, show the stress-strain line as bending
gradually over, the strongly-marked yield-point of iron and
steel being absent ; they also show how unsatisfactory, in
such eases, any tabulation of elastic-limit or yield-point
stresses and strains must be. The selection of apparently
similar points on the curves, however, leads to the discovery
at them of the same amount of shearing-stress.

132        Prof. J. Trowbridge on the 1'roduction of
   58. Practical Conclusions and Note.—The result, then, of
these experiments, as applicable to practice, is that the condi
tion for initial yielding of a uniform ductile material is the
existence of a specific shearing-stress ; and that the interme
diate principal stress is without effect.
   Note.— Cases of more than one principal stress are met with
most frequently in boilers, hydraulic cylinders, and crank
shafts. In the former cases the results obtained above lead to
the same dimensions as are obtained by the consideration of
the greatest stress only, while the maximum-strain theory
would lead to the adoption of too small a thickness. In the
case of crank-shafts, or "combined bending and twisting,"
both the greatest stress and greatest strain theories lead to too
small dimensions, the corresponding well-known formula* for
the "equivalent bending moment" being
           i(M+ VMS + T-) and |M + | JW + T
respectively, where M is the applied bending-moment and T
the applied twisting-moment. The greatest shearing-stress
theory leads to the (greater) value VM3 + T2 for the equiva
lent bending-moment, and where the dimensions are thus
determined that formula should be used. A lower factor of
safety might, however, be used in such cases, where there is a
large reserve of understressed material.
    It may also be noted that the specific shearing-stress at the
yield-point is better determined by taking one half of the
 tensional yield-point stress, than from the results of torsional
 experiments in which the sharpness of the yield-point is
 masked, as explained in § 10 and shown in fig. 15.

   VI. The Production of the x-Rays by a Battery Current.
                     By John Trowbridge*.
 I HAVE lately completed the installation of a plant of
       twenty thousand storage-cells in the Jefferson Physical
 Laboratory. This gives me over forty thousand volts and a
comparatively steady current through a large resistance.
 One of the most interesting questions in relation to this
 battery was the possibility or impossibility of producing the
                   • Communicated by the Author.

                  the x-Rayg by a Battery Current.              133
  •e-rays in an efficient manner by means of it. This question
  has been answered in the affirmative, for the rays are pro
  duced with the greatest brilliancy: and it is possible to take
  photographs of the usual subjects which lend themselves to
  this method of study. The negatives show strong contrasts,
  and there are traces of the ligaments and the muscles.
     The great advantage of this new method of producing the
  rays is in the possibility of regulating the current and the
 difference of potential which is necessary to excite the rays:
 this is not possible by any of the other methods in present
 use. When the .r-ray tube is first connected to the battery-
 terminals no current flows; it is necessary to heat the tube
 with a Bunsen burner. At a certain critical temperature the
 tube suddenly lights with a vivid fluorescence, and when the
 anticathode glows with a cherry-red the rays are given off
 with great intensity. I employed a distilled-water resistance
 of approximately four million ohms in direct circuit with the
 tube. The current, therefore, was not more than three or
 four milliamperes. It is an interesting spectacle to see the
 tube glowing in such a brilliant and noiseless fashion. Since
 such a large resistance was necessary with the use of forty
 thousand volts, it seemed possible to excite the rays witti
 fewer cells. Indeed, there is no difficulty in producing them
 brilliantly with twenty thousand cells; and I see no reason
 why they cannot be generated by a much smaller number if
a suitable tube is employed.
    Since I employed four million ohms in circuit with the
 .r-ray tube, it is evident that there were no electrical oscilla
 tions through this circuit. What is needed for the efficient
 production of the rays is a current in one direction ; a current
 moreover of sufficient strength to raise the anticathode to a
cherry-red. When the anticathode rises to a white beat, the
resistance of the tube falls to such a degree, from the gases
 which are set free from the terminals and the walls of the
tube, that the rays are enfeebled. This change of resistance
in the tube is a most important phenomenon. It is evidently
produced by the outcoming of gases which have been occluded
in the metallic terminals and on the glass walls of the tube.
Dr. Rollins of Boston has lately described, in the ' Electrical
 Engineer' for May, what seems to me a crucial experiment
in this connexion. Two Hijntgen-ray tubes of the ordinary
focus-plane pattern were joined together by a cross connexion
which was at right angles to the axes of the tubes. The
arrangement thus constituted a double .r-ray tube. This was
exhausted to a high degree : the same degree of rarefaction
was present in both tubes. One of the tubes was then heated

• 134     On the Production of the x-ltays by a Battery Current.
  until a difference of potential competent to produce a spark
  in air of an inch excited the x-rays with great brilliancy; at
  tbe same time a difference of potential giving a spark of
  eight inches could not produce tbese rays in the other con
  necting tube ; tbe same degree of vacuum, so to speak,
  existed in botb tubes. The phenomenon of the occlusion of
  gases seems to be the controlling one in the production of the
  rays, and not the degree of exhaustion. With the steady
  battery-current one can watch this phenomenon to great ad
  vantage. When the tube is heated to a certain critical tem
  perature a blue cloud proceeds from the anode, and is met
   by the cathode-beam from the cathode. If the strength of
   the current is tben gradually increased by diminishing the
   resistance in the circuit, this blue cloud fills the entire tube :
  the anticatbode grows white hot and the x-rays cease to
  appear. When the current is diminished the anticatbode
   sinks to a cherry-red, the blue cloud contracts and sinks into
   tbe anode, and the x-rays come out with great brilliancy.
   The disappearance of the blue cloud betokens a rise of re
   sistance in the tube ; for the glow on the anticatbode grows
   less and less, and presently, if the current is not increased,
   the tube is completely extinguished and a reheating is
   necessary.
      A steady battery-current with an adjustable liquid re
   sistance is indispensable, I believe, if we wish to study the
   best conditions for producing the rays. A storage-battery of
   forty thousand volts enables me to try a wide range of voltage
   and current strength ; moreover, the radiant point of the rays
   is less likely to produce ghosts. The tubes appear to glow
   in a perfectly steady way, and the degree of excitation of the
   rays seems to be under perfect control. The phenomenon of
   occlusion in an x-ray tube having such an important bearing
   on the subject of the passage of gases through a rarefied
   space, I was interested to trace the phenomenon from a pres
   sure of one or two millimetres up to the x-ray stage. I
   used for this purpose an end-on tube of a peculiar construc
   tion. One end of the tube was blown out into a thin bulb
   through which the x-rays could be observed. It was possible
   to heat this tube strongly so as to produce a high state of
    exhaustion; and this form of tube was very useful in study
    ing the electrical discharges by a spectroscope. When the
   tube was exhausted to the stratified discharge stage, and was
   connected to the terminals of the battery, the intensity and
   form of the stratifications could be changed by increasing or
    diminishing the strength of the battery-current. When this
    current was increased, a blue discharge in the form of a stra

                     On Approximately Simple Waves.              13S
   tification detached itself from the anode and joined the stra
   tifications in the narrow portion of the tube. This process
   could be repeated until there appeared to be formed a species
   of stationary wave, due apparently to the setting free of the
  gases from the anode meeting a cathode liberation. When
   the strength of the current is diminished, the stratifications
   disappear in the terminals, more noticeably in the anode than
   in the cathode. This process can be traced to the x-t&\
  stage. Since there are no electrical oscillations in the circuit,
  for I had several megohms in circuit, the molecular theorv
  of bombardment, together with the phenomenon of occlusion,
  seem to be most important. The end-on tube which was
  employed was filled with dry hydrogen obtained by electrolvsis
  from phosphoric acid and distilled water. The gas was passed
  through caustic potash and phosphoric pentoxide. Hittorf's
  resistance of iodide of cadmium in amyl alcohol will un
  doubtedly be better than distilled water in quantitative
  experiments.

                VII. On Approximately Simple Wave*.
                       By Lord Raylkigh, F.R.S*
 mi   1HE    first question that arises is as to the character of
  J. absolutely simple waves : and here " it may be well to
 emphasize that a simple vibration implies infinite continuance,
 and does not admit of variations of phase or amplitude.
 To suppose, as is sometimes done in optical speculations,
 that a train of simple waves may begin at a given epoch,
continue for a certain time involving it may be a large
number of periods, and ultimately cease, is a contradiction
in terms" t> A like contradiction is involved if we speak of
unpolarixed light as homogeneous, really homogeneous light
being necessarily polarized.
    This much being understood, approximately simple waves
might be defined as waves which for a considerable succession
deviate but little from a simple train. Under this definition
large changes of amplitude and frequency would not be
excluded, provided only that they entered slowly enough.
More frequentlv further limitation would be imposed, and
approximately simple waves would be understood to mean
waves which for a considerable succession can be approximately
identified with a simple train of given frequency, if not of
                                   Ibytl

136                      Lord Kayleigh on
given amplitude. But the phase* of the simple train approxi
mately representing the given waves would vary from place
to place, slowly indeed hut to any extent.
   Thus if we take, as analytically expressing the dependence
of the displacement upon time,
                        H. co* pt + K sin pt,                         (1)
where H and K are slowly varying functions of t, the fre
quency mav he regarded as constant, while the amplitude
 </(Hii + K*)and the phase tan-'(K/H) vary slowly but with
out limit. It scarcely needs to he pointed out that a slow
uniform progression of phase is equivalent to a small change
of frequency.
    In one important class of cases the phase remains constant
and then, since a constant addition to t need not he regarded,
(1) is sufficiently represented by
                                Hcos;tf                              (2)
simply.    If the changes of amplitude are periodic, we may
write
         H = H0 + Hi cos qt + H,' sin qt
                 + H3 cos 2,jt + H2' sin 2qt + . . .,      .   .  .  (3)
in which q is supposed to be small. The vibration (2) is
then nlwavs equivalent to a combination of simple vibrations
of frequencies represented by
           p. p+?» p—q> p+2'j' p—M> &c-
Under this head may be mentioned the case of ordinary
beats, so familiar in Acoustics. Here
                           H = H,cos</<,                             (4)
»»«•     Hcos^=£H, cosO + ^f + iHjeostp-y)/. . (5)
It may be observed that although the phase is regarded as
constant, the change of sign in the amplitude has the same
effect as an alteration of phase of 180°.
    Another important example is that of intermittent vibra
tions. If we put
                       H=2(l + cosj<),                               (6)
the amplitude is always of one sign, and
         Hcos^ = 2cos^< + cos (p + q)t + co* (j)— q)t. . (7)
Three simple vibrations are here required to represent the
 effect.
    * "What is here called for brevity the phase is more properly the
 dniat'on of phase from that of an absolutely simple train of waves.

   Again (' Theory of Sound,' § 65 a), if
                              H = 4 costy,                            (8)
we have
         Hcosy<< = ij cos pl+ cos (p + q)t + cos (p—q)t

    If K also he variable and periodic in the same period as
H. so that

                      + K2 cos 2y< + K,' sin -2</l + . . . ,   . . ( 1 0)
we have the most general periodicity expressed when we
substitute these values in (1) ; and the general conclusion as
to the periods of the simple vibrations required to represent
the effect remains undisturbed.
    If K and H vary together in such a manner that the
amplitude %/(H2 + K2) remains constant, the sole variation is
one of phase. My object at present is to call attention to
 this class of cases, so far as 1 know hitherto neglected, unless
an example (Phil. Mag. xxxiv. p. 409, 1892) in which an
 otherwise constant amplitude is periodically and suddenly
 reversed be considered an exception.
     If we take
                 H = cos (a sin qt), K = sin (a sin qt)} . . (11)
 H and K are of the required periodicity, and the condition
 of a constant amplitude is satisfied. In fact (1) becomes
                             cos (pt — ari'mqt)                      (12)

         VIII. i he Spark-Length of an Induction- Coil.
                      By R. Beattie, J3.ScS
 IN an ordinary induction-coil the relationship of the
       secondary spark-length to the conditions which obtain
 at the primary break has, at one time or another, received a
 good deal of attention : and most of the facts which are- likely
 to have any bearing on the action of the coil are well enough
 known. On one or two minor points, however, no very
 accurate or detailed data appear to exist. For instance,
 although Ri jke t has studied the effect on the secondary
 spark-length of using different materials as the primary poles,
 and although he has indicated in a general way the influence
 of rate of separation of the primary poles, yet his experiments
 were incomplete in many respects. In making the experi
 ments described in the present paper, the object was to
 extend Rijke's results, and to examine more fully how the
  length of the secondary spark depends upon the nature of
 the primary poles, the rate of break, and the electromotive
 force in the primary circuit (1) with no condenser across the
 break, (2) with condensers of various capacities across the
 break.
     Apparatus.—The coil used for the purpose of the experi
  ments was one by Apps, giving normally a 2;> cm. spark.
     Throughout the experiments the current made or broken

140                    Mr. U. Beattie on the
in the primary was always 2-5 amperes, supplied from a
battery of secondary cells. The electromotive force could
thus be altered by varying the number of cells, and the
current was adjusted to its propsr value by the introduction
of sufficient non-inductive resistance. The primary, there
fore, formed part of a circuit carrying, when closed, always
the same current of 25 amperes, and having always the
same inductance (of about 0"4 henry), but whose resistance
varied in proportion to the electromotive force acting in it.
   Tn place of the usual vibrating interrupter a special
contact-breaker was employed, by means of which the
primary poles could be separated either slowly or quickly as
desired. The essential parts of this arrangement are shown
diagrainmatically in fig. 1. A light lever OP], hinged so
                              Fig. 1.

that it can turn about one end 0, carries at the other end one
of the primary poles Pj. Immediately underneath is the
second pole P8. The two are kept in contact and the circuit
closed hy the weight of the lever. To break the circuit
a wooden disk, capable of rotating round its axis D, is
furnished with a radially-projecting metal lug L, and has a
point on its rim connected by cord with a rubber band I.
 By rotating the disk couuter-clockwise till the lug engages
the catch C, the rubber is stretched, so that, on release, the
disk flies round and the lug delivers a blow to the end of the
lever, thereby separating the poles with a rapidity governed
by the initial tension of the rubber.
   In what follows, three different rates of break are referred
to, viz. slow7, moderately quick, and very quick; and in the
curves afterwards given these are denoted by the numerals
I., II., III. respective^'. The slow break was produced by
raising the lever rather slowly by hand, no great care being
taken to separate the poles always at precisely the same rate,
as it was soon found that, up to a certain point, rate of break
has little influence on spark-length. The quick breaks were
obtained by the mechanical throw-up arrangement, the mod
erately quick and the very quick breaks corresponding to
lug-velocities of about 8 and 18 metres per second at the
moment of impact.

              Spark-Tsength of an fruhirtion-CoH.         141
discharge-rods were utilized, and the secondary spark-length
was taken to be the distance between these poles when so
adjusted that the number of sparks amounted to one-half the
number of makes or breaks of the primary.
   Make-Sparks.— For a given current established in the
primary, the only thing that can affect the length of the
make-spark of an induction-coil is the magnitude of the
electromotive force employed to produce the current. An
increase in the primary electromotive force requires an
increase in the resistance to keep down the current to its
former value. This means a primary circuit with a smaller
time-constant, which, in turn, entails a more rapid rise of
current, a greater induced electromotive force, and conse
quently a longer secondary spark. High primary electro
motive force must therefore correspond to long secondary
spark at make; in fact, as the numbers of Table I. and the
dotted curves in figs. 2 and 3 show, there exists a rough pro
portionality between the two.

   Break-Sparks tmtliout Condenser.—When, however, a given
primary current is interrupted by breaking the circuit, there
are several circumstances which unite in determining the
length of the secondary spark, viz., (1) the material of the
primary poles, (2) the suddenness with which the primary
poles are separated, and (3) the magnitude of the electro
motive force used to produce the current. Exactly in what
way each of these exerts an influence may be gathered from
the results collected together in Table II., from which the
full-line curves of figs. 2 and 3 have been plotted.

     As regards the material of the poles, for instance, it is seen
 that, other things (rate of break and electromotive force)
 being the same, sonic substances (like platinum) give a much
 longer spark than others (as carbon). This, of course, is u
 well enough known fact, the explanation of which is not far
 to seek: it is a result of carbon being a readily disintegrating
or easily arcing substance, and so setting up at the primary
 break a heavy arc which, by bridging across the gap, renders
the rupture less abrupt.
    Again, with respect to rate of break, it is seen that a quick
break corresponds to a long and a slow break to a short
spark. This, too, can readily be understood; but it is not so
easy to comprehend the part played by the primary electro
motive force in determining the length of the break-spark.
It might be expected that the existence of a high electro
motive force in the primary, by causing the arc set up at the
primary break to be maintained for a longer period, would
result in a short secondary spark. Nevertheless, the ex
periments show that this is not invariably the case; but that
while phitinum and copper poles behave in the way antici
pated, and give a shortened secondary spark for an increased
primary electromotive force, yet carbon, zinc, and lead poles
behave differently, for with them the spark-length sometimes,
i. e. when the break is slow, actually increases as the electro
motive force is raised.
    The. curves of figs. 2 and 3 further serve to bring out the
relation between the lengths of the make and break sparks,
and so help to indicate, amongst other things, the limitations
to the truth of the statement that the break-spark is longer
than the make-spark.
    Break-Sparks with Condenser.—By the introduction of a
condenser in parallel with the primary break the length of
the secondary spark is, as a rule, much enhanced. It has
long been established, however, that there is a best value for
the capacity of the condenser which gives a maximum
length of spark. Experiments have been made by Mizuno*
which show how the value of this " best capacity " and the
length of spark corresponding to it depend upon the magnitude
of the current interrupted in the primary. But it may still
be asked: For a given current broken in the primary, how
do the best capacity and the maximum spark-length depend
on the primary electromotive force, on tlie material of the
primary poles, and on the rate of break? An answer, in part
at least, to some of these questions is supplied by the results
contained in Table III., and illustrated in figs. 4, 5, and 6

   by carves which connect the spark-length with the capacity
   for different rates of break and for several different materials.
      As far as the influence of the primary electromotive force
   is concerned, it seems to matter little whether a high or
   a low electromotive force is used. At all events, I found
   that, so long as the capacity of the condenser was anything
   appreciable, it made no difference to the length of the spark
    whether I used 10 or 100 volts to produce the primary
    current of 2"5 amperes. Accordingly, over the somewhat
   narrow range which these experiments cover, the best
    capacity, as well as the maximum spark-length, is inde
   pendent of the primary electromotive force.
       On the other hand, both best capacity and maximum
   spark-length are very greatly affected by the nature of the
   primary poles. Speaking broadly, we may say that the more
   easily disintegrate the character of the poles the greater is
    the capacity needed to give the longest possible spark. Thus,
    with a slow break, the values in microfarads of the best
    capacities are:—for platinum "15, for copper '38, for zinc *45,
    and for carbon 1*1; the corresponding spark-lengths being
    29, 27, 15, and 12 millimetres respectively.
       Turning, lastly, to examine the effect of varying the rate of
    break, we observe that the tendency is for the best capacity to
    decrease and the maximum spark-length to increase as the

break is quickened. This is best seen with carbon, less distinctly
with copper, while with platinum-platinum and platinum-
niercur}- breaks the best capacity and the maximum spark-
length appear to be unaffected b\' the quickness of the break.
But the behaviour of zinc is altogether anomalous; for with
this metal an increase in the quickness of the break is accom
panied by an increase in the best capacity, and, moreover, the
way iu which the curves of fig. (i intersect each other shows
that for certain capacities a quick break may actually give a
shorter spark than a slow break. This peculiar behaviour of
zinc when used as a break-pole is probably connected in
some way with its non-arcing properties.
TX. Photograph;/ of Sound-waves, and the Kinematopraphic
   Demonstration of the Evolution* of Reflected Wave-fronts.
   By R. W. Wood, Assistant Professor of Physics in the
    University of Wisconsin *.
IN a paper published in the 'Philosophical Magazine'
      (August 189D) I gave an account of a series of photo
graphs of sound-waves undergoing reflexion, refraction,
diffraction, &c, which were made chiefly for the purpose of
illustrating certain optical phenomena to classes.
    The waves were in every case single pulses in the air
produced by electric sparks, illuminated and photographed
by the light of a second spark, properly timed with reference
to the first, the apparatus being essentially the same as that
employed b}r Toepler for the study of stripe.
    I have recently secured, by means of an improved appa
ratus, a very much better and more complete series of
photographs. A silvered mirror of eight inches aperture was
used instead of the achromatic lens. This arrangement was
used by Mach for a similar purpose, and has certain ad
vantages. Instead of allowing a torrent of sparks to pass
 between the terminals and receiving the images on a moving
 plate, as before, single sparks were used and the plate
 advanced a sufficient distance after each discharge.         This
 eliminated the hot-air currents from the pictures entirely,
 the heated air not having time to rise from behind the ball
 terminal, before the picture is taken. At the risk of sub
jecting myself to criticism for bringing matter already
 published to the attention of the Society, I wish to devote a
 few minutes to a very rapid inspection of them.
    The following cases, that were not represented in my first
 paper, [ think I may safely comment upon.
    The conjugate foci of the elliptical mirror, aplanatic for

         and the Evolutions of Reflected Wave-Fronts.    Uy
rays issuing from a point, is very beautifully shown, the
spherical wave diverging from one focus being transformed
by reflexion into a converging sphere which shrinks to a
point at the other focus.
    The transformation of a spherical into a plane wave by a
parabolic mirror is also well shown (fig. 1).
                             Fiar. I.
    The effect of spherical aberration of circular mirrors is
beautifully exhibited in several cases.
    When a plane wave enters a hemispherical mirror the
reflected wave-front is cusped, and the cusp will be seen to
lie always on the caustic surface. The form of the complete
wave in this case is not unlike a volcanic cone with a bowl-
shaped crater, the bowl eventually collapsing to a point, at
                              Ficr. 2. "
 the focus of the mirror, the sides of the cone running in
 under it and crossing. From now on the wave diverges, and
 goes out of the mirror in a form somewhat resembling the
 bell of a medusa, the caustic form by twice reflected rays
 being traced by a second cusp (tig. 2).

150     Prof. R. W. Wood on Photography of Sound- Waves
   These forms can, of course, be constructed geometrically,
and we have here a slide with a number of successive positions
of the wave-front, showing how the cusps follow the caustic
surface (fig. 3). The construction shows that there is a
                               Fig. 3.
 concentration of energy at the cusp ; consequently we may
define the cusp as a moving focus, and the caustic as the
surface traced by it. Though I hesitate in claiming that this
relation, at once so apparent, is at all novel, I may say that,
 so far as I have been able to find, it is not brought out in
any of the text*books, caustic surfaces being invariably
treated by ray rather than by wave-front methods.
    If the wave starts at the principal focus of a hemispherical
 mirror, the reflected front is nearly plane in the vicinity of
the axis, curling up at the edges, however. As this flat-
 bottomed saucer moves up, the curved sides come to a focus
along the circular edge of the flat bottom, so that in one

position the front appears as a true plane (fig. 4) ; but from
this point on the curved sides, having passed through a focus,
diverge again and follow the flat bottom. The cusp formed
by the union of these two portions traces the caustic surface,

which is in this case a very tapering funnel, as is shown well
by the geometrical construction (fig. 5).
                             Fig. 5.
   In the stage where the curved sides of the saucer have
come to a focus, we must have a ring of condensed air, sur
rounding a somewhat less condensed circular sheet ; and it
seems not unlikely that this ring could be photographed, in
an oblique direction, appearing on the plate as an ellipse.
Its optical analogy can be very nicely shown by cutting a
large round-bottomed flask in two, and silvering it, forming
in this way a fairly good hemispherical mirror. A smalt
source of light is mounted in the principal focus, and on
holding a sheet of ground glass a little outside of the centre
of curvature, a brilliant ring of light appears on it. Small
electric sparks from a coil and leyden-jar, or a pea incan
descent lamp, make a suitable light source.
   If, now, we substitute for the hemisphere a complete
sphere, we obtain very complex forms which cannot be
followed except by geometrical constructions, for the wave
is shut up in the mirror and reflected back and forth, be
coming more complicated at each reflexion (fig. 6). That
all of these very intricate forms can be constructed by geo
metry I shall show presently ; and by means of the animato-
graph, which Mr. Paul has most kindly placed at our disposal,
we can actually see the wave going through its gymnastics.
   The principle of Huygens, that any small portion of a
wave-front can be considered as the centre of a secondary
disturbance, and that a small portion of this new disturbance
can in turn be regarded as a new centre, can be shown by
the sound-waves, as well as the obliteration of the shadow

    Various cases of refraction are also shown, the only novel
 one being the transformation of a spherical into a plane wave
 by a carbonic-acid lens. The construction of the cylindrical
 lens, of exceedingly thin collodion, a matter of considerable
 difficulty, was successfully accomplished, the circular flat
 ends of very thin mica, free from stria?, enabling the passage
 of the wave through the lens to be followed (fig. 7). The
                                Fijr. 7.
 other cases of refraction have already been described, as well
 as the very beautiful instance of the formation of a train of
 waves, or musical note, by the reflexion of a single pulse from
 a steep flight of steps (fig. 8).

          and the Evolutions of Reflected Wave- Fronts.     153
   Returning now to the evolutions of plane and spherical
waves after reflexion from spherical surfaces, I wish to bring
to the attention of the Society a method of demonstrating in
a most graphic manner the progressive changes in the wave-
front reflected under these conditions.
                              Fig. 8.
         •J #^ if
    Having been unable to so control the time interval between
the two sparks that a progressive series could be taken, I
adopted the simpler method of making a large number of
geometrical constructions, and then photograpning them on
 a kinetoscope film.
    As a very large number of drawings (100 or so) must be
made if the result is to be at all satisfactory, a method is
desirable that will reduce the labour to a minimum. I may
be permitted to give, as an instance, the method that I devised
for building the series illustrating the reflexion of a plane
wave in a spherical mirror. The construction is shown iu
the figure (p. 154).
    ABC is the mirror, AOC the plane wave. Around points
on ABC ns centres describe circles tangent to the wave.
These circles will be enveloped by another surface, ADE,
below the mirror (the orthogonal surface). If we erect
normals on this surface, we have the reflected rays, and if we
 measure off equal distances on the normals, we have the
 reflected wave-front.    By drawing the orthogonal surface
we avoid the complication of having to measure off the
 distances around a corner. The orthogonal surface is an
epicycloid formed by the rolling of a circle of a diameter
equal to the radius of curvature of the minor on the mirror's

1 54   Prof. R. W. Wood on Photography of Sound- Waves
surface, and normals can be erected by drawing the arc FG
(the path of the centre of the generating circle), and de
scribing circles of diameter BE around various points on it.
A line joining the point of intersection of one of these circles
with the epicycloid, and the point of tangency with the
mirror, will, when produced, give a reflected ray ; for ex
ample, JK produced for circle described around H. This
construction once prepared, the series of wave-front pictures
can be very quickly made. Three or four sheets of paper
are laid under the construction and holes are punched through
the pile by means of a pin, at equal distances along each ray
(measured from the orthogonal surface).
   The centre of the mirror and the point where its axis
meets the surface are also indicated in the same manner.
The sheets are now separated, and corresponding pin-holes
are united on each sheet by a broad black line, which repre
sents the wave-front. Alter a time it becomes necessary to
consider double reflexions, and to do this we are compelled
to construct twice-reflected rays (indicated by dotted lines),
and measure around a corner each time.

          and tlyi Evolutions of Reflected Wave-Fronts,       155
    About a hundred pictures are prepared for each series, and
 the pictures then photographed separately on the film, which,
 when run through Mr. Paul's animatograph, will give us a
 very vivid representation of the motion of the wave-front.
    The series illustrating reflexion inside of a complete sphere
 was the most difficult to prepare, as several reflexions have
 to be considered. It has been completed for three reflexions,
 and Mr. Max Mason, of Madison, to whom I am greatly
 indebted for his patient work in assisting me, is going on
 with the series. As will be seen, the wave has already
 become quite complicated, and it will be interesting to see
 what further changes result after three or four more re
 flexions. I am also under obligations to Prof. A. B. Porter,
 of Chicago, who prepared the set of drawings illustrating the
 passage of a wave out from the principal focus of a hemi
 spherical mirror.
    A number of points taken at intervals along the film are
 here reproduced, and give a fair idea of the transformations.

X. On the Criterion that a given System of Deviations

have common integral factors really representing the genera

probable errors (or c's) and correlations of errors in any
Cfese we can find x from1 (ii:), and then an evaluation of (iii.)

probability of such an error occurring on a random selection
being made.

      The series (v.) and (vi.) both admit of fairly easy calcu
   lation, and give sensibly the same results if n be even moder
   ately large. If we put P = | in (v.) and (vi.) we have
   equations to determine Y = Xo> the va^ne givmg the "proba
   bility ellipsoid." This ellipsoid has already been considered
   by Bertrand for n=2 (probability ellipse) and Czuber for
   n = 3. The table which concludes this paper gives the
   values of P for a series of values of ^2 in a slightly different
   case. We can, however, adopt it for general purposes, when
   we only want a rough approximation to the probability or
   improbability of a given system of deviations. Suppose we

 160         Prof. Karl Pearson on Deviations from the
 have n correlated variables and we desire to ascertain whether
 an outlying observed set is really anomalous. Then we
 calculate x* from (ii.) ; next we take n' = n+ I to enter our
 table, i. e. if we have 7 correlated quantities we should look in
 the column marked 8. The row x1 and the column n + 1
 will give the value of P, the probability of a system of
 deviations as great or greater than the outlier in question.
 For many practical purposes, the rough interpolation which
 this table affords will enable us to ascertain the general order
 of probability or improbability of the observed result, and
 this is usually what we want.
     If n be very large, we have for the series in (v.) the value
  »lx3 1  e~Wd% *, and accordingly

                          ¦V!f e-Wdx = l.
     Again, the series in (vi.) for n very large becomes e**2 ,
 and thus again P = l. These results show that if we have
 only an indefinite number of groups, each of indefinitely
 small range, it is practically certain that a system of errors
as large or larger than that defined by any value of x wiH
appear.
    Thus, if we take a very great number of groups our test
becomes illusory. We must confine our attention in calcu
lating P to a finite number of groups, and this is undoubtedly
what happens in actual statistics, n will rarely exceed 30,
often not be greater than 12.
    (3) Now let us apply the above results to the problem of
the fit of an observed to a theoretical frequency distribution.
 Let there be an (n + l)-fold grouping, and let the observed
frequencies of the groups be
                     m\, m'2, m't . . . m'n} m'n+u
and the theoretical frequencies supposed known a priori be
                      fit!, ma, w»a • • • mn, wi»+1 ;
then S(m) = S(m/)=N = total frequency.
    Further, if e=-m' —m give the error, we have
                     e1 + ei + ez+ . . . +«„+i = 0.
Hence only n of the n+ 1 errors are variables; the n+ 1th is
   * Write the series as F, then we easily find dF/dx=l+^F, whence bv
integration the above result follows. Geometrically, P=l means that if

is equal to the nth moment of the whole curve, however much or
however little we cut off as " tail."

    (iii.) If n be less than 13, then the Table at the end of this
          paper will often enable us to determine the general
           probability or improbability of the observed system
           without using these values tor P at all.
    (5). Hitherto we have been considering cases in which
 the theoretical probability is known a priori. But in a great
 many cases this is not the fact ; the theoretical distribution
 has to be judged from the sample itself. The question we
 wish to determine is whether the sample may be reasonably
 considered to represent a random system of deviations from
 the theoretical frequency distribution of the general popula
 tion, but this distribution has to be inferred from the sample
 itself. Let us look at this somewhat more closely. If we
 have a fairly numerous series, and assume it to be really a
 random sample, then the theoretical number m for the whole
 population falling into any group and the theoretical
 number m, as deduced from the data for the sample will only
 differ by terms of the order of the probable errors of the
 constants of the sample, and these probable errors will be
 small, as the sample is supposed to be fairly large. We may
 accordingly take :
                                 m = m, + fi,
 where the ratio of fi to m, will, as a rule, be small. It is
  only at the "tails" that p/m, may become more appreciable,
  but here the errors or deviations will be few or small *.
     • A theoretical probability curve without limited range will never at
  the extreme tails exactly fit observation. The difficulty is obvious where
  the observations go by units and the theory by fractions. We ought to
  take our final theoretical groups to cover as much of the tail area as
  amounts to at least a unit of frequency in such cases.

          Proftable in a Correlated System of Variables.        1(55
     Now let X' ta the value found for the sample, and ^ the value
 required marking the system of deviations of the observed
 quantities from a group-system of the same number accu
  rately representing the general population.
    Then :
          L    in,    J      (.     m       J      (_ \ m, I m> )
if we neglect tonus of the order (p/in,)3.
    Hence :
    Now ^, must, I take it, be less than ¦%> for otherwise the
general population distribution or curve would give a better
 fit than the distribution or curve actually fitted to the
sample. But we are supposed to fit a distribution or curvo
to the sample so as to get the " best " values of the constants.
 Hence the right-hand side of the above equation must be
positive. If the first term be negative (hen it must be less
than the second, or the difference of ^ and ya is of the
order, not of the first but of the second power of quantities
depending on the probable errors of the sample. On the
other hand, if the first term be positive, it means that there
                                          m" — m •
is negative correlation between — and —           -' or that when
      °                            in         m;
the observed frequency exceeds the theoretical distribution
given by the sample (m'>m,), then the general population
would fall below the theoretical distribution given by the
sample (m <«)„), and vice versa. In other words the general
population and the observed population would always tend to
fall on opposite sides of the sample theoretical distribution.
Now this seems impossible ; we should rather expect, when
the observations exceeded the sample theoretical distribution,
that the general population would have also excess, and vice
versa. Accordingly, we should either expect the first term
to be negative, or to be very small (or zero) if positive. In
either case I think we may conclude that % only differs from
%> by terms of the order of the squares of the probable errors
of the constants of the sample distribution. Now our argu

Kib'       Prof. Kiirl Pearson on Demotion* from the
ment as to goodness of fit will be based on the general order
of magnitude of the probability P, and not on slight differ
ences in its value. Hence, if we reject the series as a random
variation from the frequency distribution determined from
the sample, we must also reject it as a random variation from a
theoretical frequency distribution differing by quantities of the
order of the probable errors of the constants from the sample
fieoretical distribution. On the other hand, if we accept it
as a random deviation from the sample theoretical distribu
tion, we may accept it as a random variation from a system
differing by quantities of the order of the probable errors of
the constants from this distribution.
   Thus I think we can conclude, when we are dealing with a
sufficiently long series to give small probable errors to the
constants of the series, that :—
   (i.) If x? be so small as to warrant us in speaking of the
distribution as a random variation on the frequency distribu
tion determined from itself, then we may also speak of it as a
random sample from a general population whose theoretical
distribution differs only by quantities of the order of the
probable errors of the constants, from the distribution deduced
from the observed sample.
   (ii.) If y£ be so large as to make it impossible for us to
regard the observed distribution as a sample from a general
population following the law of distribution deduced from the
sample itself, it will be impossible to consider it as a sample
from any general population following a distribution differing
only by quantities of the order of the probable errors of the
sample distribution constants from that sample distribution.
   In other words, if a curve is a good fit to a sample, to the
same fineness of grouping it may be used to describe other
samples from the same general population. If it is a bad fit,
then this curve cannot serve to the same fineness of grouping
to describe other samples from the same population.
   We thus seem in a position to determine whether a given
form of frequency curve will effectively describe the samples
drawn from a given population to a certain degree of fineness
of grouping.
   If it serves to this degree, it will serve for all rougher
groupings, but it does not follow that it will suffice for "still
finer groupings. Nor again does it appear to follow that
if the number in the sample be largely increased the same
curve will still be a good fit. Roughly the x*'s of two samples
appear to vary for the same grouping as their total contents.
Hence if a curve be a good fit for a large sample it will be
good for a small one, but the converse is not true, and a larger

           Probable in a Correlated System of Variables.      167
sample may show that our theoretical frequency gives only an
approximate law for samples of a certain size. In practice
we must attempt to obtain a good fitting frequency for such
groupings as are customary or utile.            To ascertain the
ultimate law of distribution of a population for any groupings,
however small, seems a counsel of perfection.

      Illustration VI.
    In the current text-books of the theory of errors it is cus
tomary to give various series of actual errors of observation,
to compare them with theory by means of a table of distri
bution based on the normal curve, or graphically by means of
a plotted frequency diagram, and on the basis of these com
parisons to assert that an experimental foundation has been
established for the normal law of error*. Now this procedure
is of peculiar interest. The works referred to generally give
elaborate analytical proofs that the normal law of errors is the
law of nature—proofs in which there is often a difficulty (owing
to the complexity of the analysis and the nature of the approxi
mations made) in seeing exactly what assumptions have been
really made. The authors usually feel uneasy about this process
 of deducing a law of nature from Taylor's Theorem and a
 few more or less ill-defined assumptions ; and having deduced
 the normal curve of errors, they give as a rule some meagre
 data of how it fits actual observation. But the comparison of
 observation and theory in general amounts to a remark —based
 on no quantitative criterion—of how well theory and practice
really do fit ! Perhaps the greatest defaulter in this respect
is the late Sir George Biddell Airy in his text-book on the
 ' Theory of Errors of Observation.' In an Appendix he gives
 what he terms a " Practical Verification of the Theoretical
 Law for the Frequency of Errors."
    Now that Appendix really tells us absolutely nothing as to
 the goodness of fit of his 63(5 observations of the N.P.D. of
 Polaris to a normal curve. For, if we first take on faith what he
 says, namely, that positive and negative errors may be clubbed
 together, we still find that he has thrice smoothed his obser
 vation frequency distribution before he allows us to examine it.
 It is accordingly impossible to say whether it really does or
 does not represent a random set of deviations from a normal
 frequency curve. All we can deal with is the table he gives of
 observed and theoretical errors and his diagram of the two
 curves. These, of course, are not his proper data at all : it is
 impossible to estimate how far his three smoothings counter
 balance or not his multiplication of errors by eight. But as I
  understand Sir George Airy, he would have considered such a
  system of errors as he gives on his p. 117 or in his diagram
  on p. 118 to be sufficiently represented by a normal curve.
  Now I have investigated his 37 groups of errors, observational

172         Prof. Karl Pearson on Deviations from the
and theoretical. In order to avoid so many different groups,
 I have tabulated his groups in "10" units, and so reduced them
 to 21. From these 2l groups I have found ^2 by the method
of this paper. By this reduction of groups I have given
 Sir George Airy's curve even a better chance than it has, as
it stands. Yet what do we find ? Why,
                            Xs=36-2872.
Or, using the approximate equation,
                            P = -0U23.
That is to say, only in one occasion out of 71 repetitions of
such a set of observations on Polaris could we have expected
to find a system of errors deviating as widely as this set (or
more widely than this set) from the normal distribution. Yet
Sir George Airy takes a set of observations, the odds against
which being a random variation from the normal distribution
are 70 to 1 , to prove to us that the normal distribution applies to
errors of observation. Nay, further, he cites tbis very impro
bable result as an experimental confirmation of the whole
theory ! " It is evident," he writes, " that the formula repre
sents with all practicable accuracy the observed Frequency
of Errors, upon which all the applications of the Theory of
Probabilities are founded : and the validity of every investi
gation in this Treatise is thereby established."
    Such a passage demonstrates how healthy is the spirit of
scepticism in all inquiries concerning the accordance of theory
and nature.

    It is desirable to illustrate such results a second time.
Professor Merriman in his treatise on Least Squares * starts
in the right manner, not with theory, but with actual expe
rience, and then from his data deduces three axioms. From
these axioms he obtains by analysis the normal curve as the
theoretical result. But if these axioms be true, his data can
only differ from the normal law of frequency by a system of
deviations such as would reasonably arise if a random
selection were made from material actually obeying the
normal law. Mow Professor Merriman puts in the place of
honour 1000 shots fired at a line on a target in practice for
tbe U.S. Government, the deviations being grouped according
to the belts struck, the belts were drawn on the target of
equal breadth and parallel to the line. The following table

    Hence we deduce:           P = -000,00155.
     In other words, if shots are distributed on a target according
 to the normal law, then such a distribution as that cited by
 Mr. Merriman could only be expected to occur, on an average,
 some 15 or 16 times in 10,000,000 trials. Now surely it is
 very unfortunate to cite such an illustration as the foundation
 of those axioms from which the normal curve must flow !
 For if the normal curve flows from the axioms, then the data
 ought to be a probable system of deviations from the normal
 curve. But this they certainly are not. Now it appears to
 me that, if the earlier writers on probability had not pro
 ceeded so entirely from the mathematical standpoint, but had
 endeavoured first to classify experience in deviations from
 the average, and then to obtain some measure of the actual
  goodness of tit provided by the normal curve, that curve
  would never have obtained its present position in the theory
  of errors. Even today there are those who regard it as a sort
  of fetish ; and while admitting it to be at fault as a means of
  generally describing the distribution of variation of a quantity
  x from its mean, assert that there must be some unknown
  quantity z of which x is an unknown function, and that z
  really obeys the normal law ! This might be reasonable if
  there were but few exceptions to this universal law of error ;
  but the difficulty is to find even the few variables which obey
  it, and these few arc not those usually cited as illustrations by
  the writers on the subject !

   The reader may ask : Is it not possible to find material
which obeys within probable limits the normal law ? I reply,
yes ; but this law is not a universal law of nature. We must
hunt for cases. Out of three series of personal equations, I
could only find one which approximated to the normal law.
I took 500 lengths and bisected them with my pencil at sight.

a normal distribution. It is noteworthy, however, that I found
other observers' errors in judgment of the same series of lines
were distinctly skew.
    (8) We can only conclude from the investigations here
considered that the normal curve possesses no special fitness
for describing errors or deviations such as arise either in
observing practice or in nature. We want a more general
theoretical frequency, and the fitness of any such to desc rib
a given series can be investigated by aid of the criterion dis
cussed in this paper. For the general appreciation of the
probability of the occurrence of a system of deviations defined
by x* (or any greater value), the accompanying table has
been calculated, which will serve to give that probability
closely enough for many practical judgments, without the
calculations required by using the formulae of art. 4.

     C. Naud, 1900 : pp. xi+256.
 rPHERE are two ways of writing a history of mathematics. Oue,
  -*- which appeals to the general reader, consists in giving copious
 biographical details of the men to whose genius the science owes
 its existence, and in referring to their actual contributions to the
 science in as brief and concise a manner as possible. The other
 is to assign the chief place to their scientific contributions, and
 treat their biographies as of secondary importance. Of course,
 the two methods may be combined, but it seems to us that, if the
 book is to be kept within moderate limits, the writer will prefer to
 adopt one or other of the two plans indicated. M. Boyer appears
 to have chosen the second ; his book is oue primarily addressed
 to the student, and not to the general reader. The treatment is
 highly compressed, and it is very seldom that the author gives us
 anything beyond the dates of birth and death and the merest
 skeleton outline of the careers of the men who have moulded the
 science : he prefers to reserve his space for an account of their
scientific work, and to present that account in as elementary a
 manner as the nature of the subject will allow. An interesting
and puzzling piece of information is contained in the first chapter
of the book, where, in giving an account of the recently discovered
Babylonian tablets (dating back to 2000 B.C.) containing tables of
the squares of the natural numbers, the author points out that the
method of notation employed undoubtedly suggests the use of a
se.ragesimal system ! The illustrations—of which there are 26—
add greatly to the interest of the book ; they are all reproductions
of old engravings. The book is beautifully printed, and we have
not noticed any typographical errors, with the single exception of
p. 108, where 4 [2J+3 [1] should read 3 [2] + 4 [1J. The book is
thoroughly up to date, the last chapter coutainiug a brief sketch
of the most recent developments of the science. To anybody
wishing to acquire some knowledge of the history of mathematics,
the book may be safely recommended as containing the desired
information in a very concise form. But we cannot help thinking
that the book might have been rendered much more interesting
by the introduction of some of those human touches which render
Mr. W. W.E. Ball's ' Short History of Mathematics' such delight
ful reading.

 Physikalisches Praktikum.       Mil besonderer Beriick&ichtigunf/ der
   physilcalisch-chemigchen Methoden. Von Eiliiard Wiedemann

     1899: pp. xxx. + 574.
    Tbe fact that this book is now in its fourth edit ion may betaken
as a sufficient guarantee of its general excellence. One of its
special features is the attention given to measurements which are of
importance in chemical investigations, such as the determination of
vapour-densities, melting-points, boiling-points, heats of neutral
ization Ac. Thearrangemenfcof thesubjectmatterisstrictly method
ical, the general plan followed consisting in prefacing each section
by a brief yet lucid account of the principles involved, then
describing the apparatus used, and finally giving directions for
carrying out a number of measurements. Great credit is due to
the publishers for the beautiful engravings illustrating the various
 forms of instruments and apparatus described in the book ; it is
 not often that such a uniformly high standard of excellence is
maintained in this respect.
    In a few of its details, the book would appear to be capable of
some degree of improvement. Thus, it is extremely doubtful
whether the section dealing with the "proof "of Ohm's law is con
ducive to clearing up a student's ideas on this subject. A "proof"
of the law which involves the use of an electromagnetic voltmeter can
hardly be taken seriously. Again, we regret to notice that the
authors appear to use the terms " electromotive -force " and " poten
tial difference " indiscriminately; this pernicious habit is productive
of not a little confusion in the mind of a student. In the section
on photometry, the form of Lummer and Brodhun photometer
described is not the latest type of this instrument, but is an early
form, which has since undergone considerable modifications.
   In spite, however, of a few defects such as those noticed, there
are probably few books on the subject which contain so large a mass
of up-to-date and reliable information in so small a compass, and so
attractive a form. The student who conscientiously works through
the book aud carries out the experiments described in it, will have
acquired a very sound knowledge of physical processes and measure
ments. The tables and formula? given at the end of the book-
should prove extremely useful. The copious table of contents at
the beginning and the index at the end of the book also deserve a
word of praise.

 written in very simple language and pre-supposing an extremely
 moderate knowledge on the part of the reader ; and highly advanced
 treatises, which could be read only by those who had previously
 undergone a severe training in the higher branches of mathematics,
 and which were quite beyond the reach of any reader with more
 modest attainments. Between t hese two classes of hooks there w ;is
 a great gulf fixed, with only very few exceptions. So help was
 offered to the student who, having taken the first steps in the subject,
 and finding himself unable to attend more classes or seek the
 guidance of a competent teacher, desired by private study some
 what to enlarge the meagre store of knowledge which he already
 possessed. If he turned to the various books at his disposal, he
 found that they either did not teach him anything which lie did
 not already know, or else that they gave him a fit of mentnl
 indigestion.
    This somewhat discreditable state of affairs has, it is true, been
 largely remedied nowadays, and the gap which formerly existed is
 being rapidly filled. It is a most promising sign of the times that
our leaders in physical science no longer scorn to produce books of
n fairly " elementary " character : it is hardly possible to exaggerate
the importance which works of this kind have in raising the general
 level of scientific knowledge, and in stimulating further inquiry.
    It is, therefore, greatly to the credit of the accomplished author
of the book before us that as far back as 1877 it had occurred to
him that possibly a few people might like to know some! bins,' about
the kinetic theory of gases who did not share the profound know
ledge of the brilliant mathematicians by whose efforts the theory
had been largely built up. Accordingly he set to work, and
succeeded in producing a book which is now passing through a
second edition, and of which the work under review is an English
translation by Mr. Baynes.
    Although described as an "elementary treatise'' on the subject,
the book consists of 352 pages forming the elementary portion,
with 120 additional pages of" mathematical appendices," intended
for the more advanced reader. This plan of sifting out the
mathematics and relegating them to an appendix seems—in the
present case, at any rate— to present a distinct advantage: the
attention of the reader being thereby directed to the physical
aspect of the reasoning, and not being diverted by purely mathe
matical difficulties. In the brief space at our disposal, we can do
little more than merely indicate the nature and scope of the con
tents of the book. It is divided into three parts. Part I. deals
with molecular motion and its energy, and is subdivided into five
chapters dealing with (1 ) the foundations of the kinetic theory; (2)
the pressure of gases ; (3) Maxwell's law of speed distribution ; '(4)
ideal and actual gases ; and (5) the relation of molecular to atomic
energy. Part II. is concerned with the molecular free paths and
the. phenomena conditioned by them, and is subdivided into four
chapters, dealing with (1) the molecular free paths ; (2) the vis

cosity of gases ; (3) diffusion and (4) conduction of heat. Part 111.,
on the direct properties of molecules, consists of a single chapter—
probably the most fascinating in the whole book.
    For the benefit of those who wish to pursue their studies beyond
the limits of the book, a wealth of references to original sources of
information is given. English physicists will feel a debt of
gratitude to Mr. Barnes for the trouble of translating the book—¦
no easy task—and for the few notes which he has appended to it.
It is, therefore, somewhat unwillingly that we close this notice by
saving that in several instances we consider the translation some
 what too literal, with the result that the English rendering smacks
too much of the German idiom.

    2. ' The Rocks of the South-eastern Coast of Jersey.' By John
 Parkinson, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author has continued the study of the deep-
seated rocks of Jersey begun in a communication presented to the
 Jsociety last session entitled ' On an Intrusion of Granite into
 Diabase at Sorel Point (Northern Jersey).' A great resemblance
 exists between these rocks in the north and south of the islaud,
 and it is concluded that they represent parts of the same magma ;
 but in the south-east additional complications arise, owing to the
 intrusion of another rock before the invasion of the granite. For
 convenience of study the district under discussion is divided
 into two parts, an Eastern and a Western, separated the one from
 the other by the western termination of the Grcve d'Azette. In
 I he Eastern dist rict the granite and the intrusive rock which pre
 ceded it are found ; in the Western a rather different rock invades
 the diabase. The latter is correlated with the aplite-intrusion of
 the northern coast.
     Taking fiist the earlier intrusion found at Le Nez Point, it is
 shown that it consists of a rock moro acid than a diorite, but on
 the whole more basic than the granite which followed it. Micro
 scopical examination indicates that it was poor in ferro-magnesian
 minerals, and that quart/, and orthoclase, though present, are not
 found in the proportion which characterizes the granite. This
 rock, the exact composition of which it is not easy to discover, has
invaded the diabase, as well as a dioritic rock associated with it,
streaking and veining them. Mixing took place as a result of such

intrusion, producing ft composite rock characterized by elongated
 hornblendes which occasionally attain a considerable size. Mica is
 conspicuously absent.
    The intrusion of the granite following this is next described.
 Here, as on the northern coast, local absorption of the older rock
 has taken place. The resemblance between the mixed rocks is
 commented upon, and a parallel drawn between the basic and acid
 rocks of Jersey and the eastern and northern coasts of Guernsey.
    Passing to the Western district, the aplite of St. Elizabeth's
 Castle is described, together with the melting and absorption which
 have taken place as a consequence of this intrusion. Field-evidence
 indicates that this is later than any intrusion found in the Eastern
 district, though the difference in age is probably but slight ;
 thus it bears out the results of work on the northern coast, where
 the intrusion of an aplite was found to have followed that of a
porphyritic granite. Reasons are given in the body of the paper
for believing that successive intrusions cannot be separated the
one from the other by hard-and-fast lines. Finally, it is suggested
that the various rocks considered are closely related, and indeed
form parts of one magma, the successive injections of which became
progressively more acid.
   3. 'The Rocks of La Saline (Northern Jersey).'            By John
Parkinson, Esq., F.G.S.
    The rocks of La Saline closely resemble those of Sorel Point,
about a mile to the west. A coarse porphyritic granite is found
in the upper part of the cliff which passes rapidly into an equally
coarse but redder rock, approaching an aplite in composition.
The latter occasionally contains mica in some quantity, and evi
dence is given for concluding that this mineral has been produced
by the combination of the constituents of the augite of a dolerite,
through which the acid magma forced its way, and the felspathic
parts of the magma itself. This evidence is based (i) on the
fact that in one part of the Bay a few outcrops of rock are
found identical with others from Sorel Point, which have been
clearly formed by the absorption of fragments of diabase (dolerite)
by an acid magma ; (ii) on the presence of fragment-like patches
rich in mica in the aplite itself; (iii) by the irregular distribution
of this mineral through the acid rock. A peculiar quartz-less rock
is next described containing large orthoclases, plagioclase, and
chlorite : it is concluded that the last-named mineral is derived
from mica. With some hesitation the structure of this rock is
explained by supposing that the intruding magma melted a mass of
dolerite, completely dissolved the felspar, and produced mica in the
manner indicated above ; and that as freedom of movement was not
greatly restricted, segregation of the basic elements followed, enclos
ing among them numerous porphyritic orthoclases. Some move
ment of the whole then appears to have taken place.

       the Motion through the Space occupied by it of a body acting

   § 1. PT^HE title of the present communication describes a
          J.    pure problem of abstract mathematical dynamics,
   without indication of any idea of a physical application.
  For a merely mathematical journal it might be suitable,
  because the dynamical subject is certainly interesting both in
  itself and in its relation to waves and vibrations. My reason
  for occupying myself with it, and for offering it to the
   Royal Society of Edinburgh, is that it suggests a conceivable
  explanation of the greatest difficulty hitherto presented by
  the undulatory theory of light ;— the motion of ponderable
  bodies through infinite space occupied by an elastic solid f»
      § 2. In consideration of the confessed object, and for
  brevity, I shall use the word atom to denote an ideal
  substance occupying a given portion of solid space, and
 acting on the ether within it and around it, according to the
  old-fashioned eighteenth century idea of attraction and
  repulsion. That is to say, every infinitesimal volume A of

 Society of Edinburgh, July 16th, 1900.
     t T*he so-called " electro-magnetic theory of light"' does not cut away
 this foundation from the old undulatory theory of light. It adds to that
primary theory an enormous province of transcendent interest and
importance ; it demands of us not merely an explanation of nil the
phenomena of light and radiant heat by transverse vibrations of an elastic
 si lid called ether, but also the inclusion of electric currents, of the
permanent magnetism of steel and lodestone, of magnetic force, and of
electrostatic force, in a comprehensive ethereal dynamics.

the atom acts on every infinitesimal volume B of the ether
with a force in the line PQ joining the centres of these two
volumes, equal to
                         A/(P,PQ)PB                          (1),
where p denotes the density of the ether at Q, and/(P, PQ)
denotes a quantity depending on the position of P and on the
distance PQ. The whole force exerted by the atom on the
portion pB of the ether at Q, is the resultant of all the forces
calculated according to (1), for all the infinitesimal portions
A into which we imagine the whole volume of the atom to be
divided.
   § 3. According to the doctrine of the potential in the
well-known mathematical theory of attraction, we find rect-
angular components of this resultant as follows : —
      X = pB^<f>(x,y;z); Y = Pnfy[x,y,z) ; I
                                                       <U+25BA> •   (*),
                               Z = pB j-<f>(x, y, z)
where x, y, z denote co-ordinates of Q referred to lines fixed
with reference to the atom, and <j> denotes a function (which
we call the potential at Q due to the atom) found by sum
mation as follows :—
                   *=§§A$* dr/(P'r) • • • ' <3)'
where JjT A denotes integration throughout the volume of
the atom.
   § 4. The notation of (1) has been introduced to signify
that no limitation as to admissible law of force is essential ;
but no generality, that seems to me at present practically
desirable, is lost if we assume, henceforth, that it is the
Newtonian law of the inverse square of the distance. This
makes
                         /(P,PQ)=p^                         (4),
and therefore
                     Ldr/(p>r)=h                             (5),
where a is a coefficient specifying for the point, P, of the
atom, the intensity of its attractive quality for ether. Using

  and the components of the resultant force are still expressed
  by (2). We may suppose a to be either positive or negative
  (positive for attraction and negative for repulsion) ; and in
  fact in our first and simplest illustration of the problem we
  suppose it to be positive in some parts and negative in other
  parts of the atom, in such quantities as to fulfil the condition
                                ,A* = 0                        (7).
     § 5. As a first and very simple illustration, suppose the
  atom to be spherical, of radius unity, with concentric interior
 spherical surfaces of equal density. This gives, for the
 direction of the resultant force on any particle of the ether,
 whether inside or outside the spherical boundary of the atom,
a line through the centre of the atom. The further assump
 tion of (7) may now be expressed by
                         iJo
                             drr%a = Q
 and this, as we are now supposing the forces between every
                                                              (8);
  particle of the atom and every particle of the ether to be
 subject to the Newtonian law, implies, that the resultant of
 its attractions and repulsions is zero for every particle of
 ether outside the boundary of the atom. To simplify the
case to the utmost, we shall further suppose the distribution
of positive and negative density of the atom, and the law of
compressibility of the ether, to be such, that the average
density of the ether within the atom is equal to the un
disturbed density of the ether outside. Thus the attractions
and repulsions of the atom in lines through its centre pro
duce, at different distances from its centre, condensations
and rarefactions of the ether, with no change of the total
• juantity of it within the boundary of the atom ; and there-
lore produce no disturbance of the ether outside. To fix
 the ideas, and to illustrate the application of the suggested
hypothesis to explain the refractivity of ordinary isotropic
transparent bodies such as water or glass, I have chosen a
ilefinite particular case in which the distribution of the ether
when at rest within the atom is expressed by the following
formula, and partially shown in the accompanying diagram
 (p. 186), and tables of calculated numbers :—
                                  ,.'3

184      Lord Kelvin on the Motion 0/ Ponderable Matter
Here, r denotes the undisturbed distance from the centre
of the atom, of a particle of the ether which is at distance
r when at rest under the influence of the attractive and
repulsive forces.     According to this notation -^ o"(r*) is the
disturbed volume of a spherical shell of ether whose un-
disturbed radius is /and thickness SV and volume -^-oYr").
                                                                6
Hence, if we denote the disturbed and undisturbed densities
of the ether by p and unity respectively, we have
                           P8(^)=S(r")                              (10);
whence, by (9),
                           3[l + K(l-r')«]8
                      P = 3 + K(3-r')(l                               (11).
                                                >')
    This gives 1 + K for the density of the ether at the centre
 of the atom. In order that the disturbance may suffice for
 refractivities such as those of air, or other gases, or water, or
 glass, or other transparent liquids or isotropic solids, ac
 cording to the dynamical theory explained in §(16) below,
 I find that K may for some cases be about equal to 100,
 and for others must be considerably greater. I have there
 fore taken K = 100, and calculated and drawn the accom
 panying tables and diagram accordingly.

    § 6. The diagram (fig. 1) helps us to understand the dis
  placement of ether and the resulting distribution of density,
  within the atom. The circular arc marked 1*00 indicates a
 spherical portion of the boundary of the atom ; the shorter
 of the circular arcs marked '95, "90,            *20, '10 indicate
 spherical surfaces of undisturbed ether of radii equal to these
 numbers. The position of the spherical surfaces of the same
 portions of ether under the influence of the atom, are in
 dicated by the arc marked TOO, and the longer of the arcs
 marked '95, "90, . . . "50, and the complete circles marked
 •40, *30, '20, '10. It may be remarked that the average
 density of the ether within any one of the disturbed spherical
 surfaces, is equal to the cube of the ratio of the undisturbed
 radius to the disturbed radius, and is shown numerically in
 column 2 of Table I. Thus, for example, looking at the
 table and diagram, we see that the cube of the radius of the
 short arc marked "50 is 26 times the cube of the radius of
the long arc marked "50, and therefore the average density
of the ether within the spherical surface corresponding to the
latter is 26 times the density (unity) of the undisturbed ether
within the spherical surface corresponding to the former.
The densities shown in column 4 of each table are the
densities of the ether at (not the average density of the ether
within) the concentric spherical surfaces of radius r in the
atom. Column 5 in each table shows l/47re of the excess
(positive or negative) of the quantity of ether in a shell of
radius r and infinitely small thickness e as disturbed by the
atom above the quantity in a shell of the same dimensions of

 undisturbed ether. The formula of col. 2 makes r=l when
 r = 1, that is to say the total quantity of the disturbed ether
 within the radius of the atom is the same as that of undis
 turbed ether in a sphere of the same radius. Hence the sum
 of the quantities of ether calculated from col. 5 for con
 secutive values of r, with infinitely small differences from
 r=0 to r=l, must be zero. Without calculating for smaller
 differences of r than those shown in either of the tables, we
 find a close verification of this result by drawing, as in fig. 2,

a curve to represent (p — l)^2 through the points for which
its value is given in one or other of the tables, and measuring
the areas on the positive and negative sides of the line of
abscissas. By drawing on paper (tour times the scale of the
annexed diagram), showing engraved squares of '5 inch and
•1 inch, ana counting the smallest squares and parts of
squares in the two areas, I have verified that they are equal
within less than 1 per cent, of either sum, which is as close
as can be expected from the numerical approximations shown
in the tables, and from the accuracy attained in the drawing.
   § 7. In Table I. (argument r1) all the quantities are shown
for chosen values of r1, and in Table II. for chosen valni
of r. The calculations for Table I. are purely algr
involving merely cube roots beyond elementary arit
To calculate in terms of given values of r the result
in Table II. involves the solution of a cubic equation.

188      Lord Kelvin on the Motion of Ponderable Matter
have been actually found by aid of a curve drawn from the
numbers of col. 3 Table I., showing r in terms of r1. The
numbers in col. 2 of Table II. showing, for chosen values
of r, the corresponding values of »•', have been taken from
the curve; and we may verify that they are approximately
equal to the roots of the equation shown at the head of
col. 2 of Table I., regarded as a cubic for »•' with any given
values of r and K.
    Thus*, for example, taking r'=-929 we calculate /• = "811,
                             „     r' = -816                  r = -498,
                             „     r' = -677                  r=-301,
                             „     -i' = -091                 r=-0208,
where we should have r=-8, -5, -3, and -02 respectively.
These approximations are good enough for our present
purpose.
    § 8. The diagram of fig. 2 is interesting, as showing how,
with densities of ether varying through the wide range of from
*85 to 101, the whole mass within the atom is distributed among
the concentric spherical surfaces of equal density. We see
by it, interpreted in conjunction with col. 4 of the tables,
that from the centre to "56 of the radius the density falls
 from 101 to 1. For radii from '56 to 1, the values of (p — l)?-*
 decrease to a negative minimum of "525 at ?- = "93, and rise
to zero at r=l. The place of minimum density is of course
inside the radius at which (/>— l)r* is a minimum ; by
 cols. 4 and 3 of Table I., and cols. 4 and 1 of Table II., we
 see that the minimum density is about '35, and at distance
approximately *87 from the centre.
    § 9. Let us suppose now our atom to be set in motion
through space occupied by ether, and kept in motion with a
uniform velocity v, which we shall first suppose to be in
finitely small in comparison with the propagational velocity
of equivoluminal * waves through pure ether undisturbed by
any other substance than that of the atom. The velocity of
the earth in its orbit round the sun being about 1/10,000 of
the velocity of light, is small enough to give results, kinematic
and dynamic, in respect to the relative motion of ether and
the atoms constituting the earth closely in agreement with
this supposition.       According to it, the position of every
particle of the ether at any instant is the same as if the atom
were at rest; and to find the motion produced in the ether by
the motion of the atom, we have a purely kinematic problem
of which an easy graphic solution is found by marking on a
   • That is to say, waves of transverse vibration, being the only kind of
 wave in an isotropic solid iu which every part of the solid keeps its
volume unchanged during the motion. See Phil. Mag., Mav, August,
and Octnner, 1899.

                through Space occupied by Ether.              1 89
diagram the successive positions thus determined for any
particle of the ether, according to the positions of the atom
at successive times with short enough intervals between them,
to show clearly the path and the varying velocity of the
particle.
   § 10. Look, for example, at fig. 3, in which a semi-circum
ference of the atom at the middle instant of the time we are
going to consider, is indicated by a semicircle C^ACo, with dia
meter CqCso equal to two units of length. Suppose the centre
of the atom to move from right to left in the straight line C0C20
with velocity "1, taking for unit of time the time of travelling
1/10 of the radius. Thus, reckoning from the time when the
centre is at C0, the times when it is at C2, C5, Ci0, 018, C20
are 2, 5, 10, 18, 20. Let Q' be the undisturbed position of a
particle of ether before time 2 when the atom reaches it, and
after time 18 when the atom leaves it. This implies that
Q'C2=Q'C18=1, andC2C10=C10Cjg = -8, and therefore C10Q'
= '6. The position of the particle of ether, which when
undisturbed is at Q', is found for any instant t of the dis
turbance as follows : —
   Take C0C = </10; draw Q'C, and calling this / find r'-r
by formula (9), or Table I. or II. : in Q'C take Q,Q=r'-r.
Q is the position at time t of the particle whose undisturbed
position is Q'. The drawing shows the construction for t = 2,
and t = 5, and < = 18. The positions at times 2, 3, 4, 5, ... .
15, 1C, 17, 18 are indicated by the dots marked 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ti, 7, 8 on the closed curve with a
corner at Q', which has been found by tracing a smooth curve
through them. This curve, which, for brevity, we shall call
the orbit of the particle, is clearly tangential to the lines
Q'CS and Q'CW. By looking to the formula (9), we see that
the velocity of the particle is zero at the instants of leaving
Q' and returning to it. Fig. 4 shows the particular orbit of
fig. 3, and nine others drawn by the same method ; in all ten
orbits of ten particles whose undisturbed positions are in one
line at right angles to the line of motion of the centre of the
atom, and at distances 0, '1, "2, . . . "9 from it. All these
particles are again in one straight line at time 10, being what
we may call the lime of mid-orbit of each particle. The
numbers marked on the right-hand halves of the orbits are
times from the zero of our reckoning; the numbers 1, 2, 3 . • .
etc. on the left correspond to times 11, 12, 13 . . . of our
reckoning as hitherto, or to times 1, 2, 3 . . . after mid-orbit
passages. Lines drawn across the orbits through 1, 2, 3 . . .
on the left, show simultaneous positions of the ten particles at
times 1, 2, 3 after mid-orbit. The line drawn from 4 across
seven of the curved orbits, shows for time 4 after mid-orbit,

simultaneous positions of eight particles, whose undisturbed
distances are 0, *1, . . . *7. Remark that the orbit for the
first of these ten particles is a straight line.
   §11. We have thus in § 10 solved one of the two chief
kinematic questions presented by our problem: —to find the
orbit of a particle of ether as disturbed by the moving atom,
relatively to the surrounding ether supposed fixed. The other
question, to find the path traced through the atom supposed
fixed while, through all space outside the atom, the ether is
supposed to move uniformly in parallel lines, is easily solved,
as follows:—Going back to fig. 3, suppose now that instead
of, as in § 10, the atom moving from right to left with
velocity '1 and the ether outside it at rest, the atom is at rest
and the ether outside it is moving from left to right with
velocity -1. Let '2, '3, '4, '5, '6, 7, '8, '9, 0, '1, % % '4, '5,
'6, '7, '8 be tho path of a particle of ether through the atom
marked by seventeen points corresponding to the same num
bers unaccented showing the orbit of the same particle of
ether on the former supposition. On both suppositions, the
position of the particle of ether at time 10 from our original
era, (§ 10), is marked 0. For times 11, 12, 13, etc., the
positions of the particle on the former supposition are marked
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 on the left half of the orbit. The positions
of the same particle on the present supposition are found by
drawing from the points 1, 2, 3, ... 7, 8 parallel lines to the
right, 1 '1, 2 '2, 3 '3, ... 7 '7, 8 '8, equal respectively to
•1, *2, *3, . . . '7, "8 of the radius of the atom, being our unit
of length. Thus we have the latter half of the passage of the
particle through the atom; the first half is equal and similar
on the left-hand side of the atom. Applying the same process
to every one of the ten orbits shown in fig. 4 (p. 192), and to the
nine orbits of particles whose undisturbed distances from the
central line on the other side are "1, "2, . . . *9, we find the set
of stream-lines shown in fig. 5 (p. 1 93) . The dots on these lines
show the positions of the particles at times 0, 1, 2, . . . 19, 20
of our original reckoning (§ 10). The numbers on the
stream-line of the particle whose undisturbed distance from
the central line is "6 are marked for comparison with fig. 3.
The lines drawn across the stream-lines on the left-hand side of
fig. 5 show simultaneous positions of rows of particles of ether
which, when undisturbed, are in straight lines perpendicular
to the direction of motion. The quadrilaterals thus formed
 within the left-hand semicircle show the figures to which the
 squares of ether, seen entering from the left-hand end of the
 diagram, become altered in passing through the atom. Thus
 we have completed the solution of our second chief kinematic
 question.

   § 12. The first dynamic question that occurs to us, return
ing to the supposition of moving atom and of ether outside it
at rest, is :—What is the total kinetic energy (*) of the
portion of the ether which at. any instant is within the atom ?
To answer it, think of an infinite circular cylinder of the
ether in the space traversed by the atom. The time-integral
from any era t=0 of the total kinetic energy of the ether in
this cylinder is tic ; because the ether outside the cylinder is
undisturbed by the motion of the atom according to our
present assumptions. Consider any circular disk of this
cylinder of infinitely small thickness e. After the atom has
passed it, it has contributed to tic, an amount equal to
the time-integral of the kinetic energies of all the orbits of
small parts into which we may suppose it divided, and it con
tributes no more in subsequent time. Imagine the disk
divided into concentric rings of rectangular cross-section e di}.
The mass of one of these rings is 'birr'dr'e because its density
is unity ; and all its parts move in equal and similar orbits.
Thus we find that the total contribution of the disk amounts to
                       2m (" dr'r1 \d*2/dt                    (12),
where \ds2jdt denotes integration over one-half the orbit of
a particle of ether whose undisturbed distance from the
central line is i1 ; (because ^dsi/dti is the kinetic energy of an
ideal particle of unit mass moving in the orbit considered).
Now the time-integral Kt is wholly made up by contributions
of successive disks of the cylinder. Hence (12") shows the
contribution per time e/g, q being the velocity of the atom ;
and (k being the contribution per unit of time) we therefore
have
                       tc^lirqV dr'AdJldt . . . .             (13).
   § 13. The double integral shown in (13) has been evaluated
with amply sufficient accuracy for our present purpose by
seemingly rough summations ; firstly, the summations §ds"/dt
for the ten orbits shown in fig. 4, and secondly, summation of
these sums each multiplied by d?JV. In the summations for
each half-orbit, ds has been taken as the lengths of the curve
between the consecutive points from which the curve has
been traced. 'Jliis implies taking dt=l throughout the three
orbits corresponding to undisturbed distances from the central
line equal respectively to 0, "6, -8 ; and throughout the other
semi-orbits, except for the portions next the corner, which
correspond essentially to intervals each < 1. The plan

                   through Space occupied by Ether.                        195
followed is sufficiently illustrated by the accompanyin
Table III., which shows the whole process of calculating an
summing the parts for the orbit corresponding to undisturbed
distance "7.
    Table IV. shows the sums for the ten orbits and the products
of each sum multiplied by the proper value of »¦', to prepare
for the final integration, which has been performed by finding
the area of a representative curve drawn on conveniently
squared paper aa described in § 6 above. The result thus
found is '02115. It is very satisfactory to see that, within
•1 per cent., this agrees with the simple sum of the widely
different numbers shown in col. 3 of Table IV.

    §. 14. Using in (13) the conclusion of § 13, and taking
q — 1, we find
                           *=2tt.-002115 ...... (14).
A convenient way of explaining this result is to remark that
                                        ~a~ a1 ('l)s \) °f an ideal globe
                                       (47T
of rigid matter of the same bulk as our atom, moving with
the same velocity. Looking now at the definition of tc in the
beginning of § 12, we may put our conclusion in words,
thus :—The distribution of ethereal density within our ideal
spherical atom represented by (11) with K = 100, gives rise
to kinetic energy of the ether within it at any instant, when the
atom is moving slowly through space filled with ether, equal
to "634 of the kinetic energy of motion with the same
Velocity through ideal void space, of an ideal rigid globe of

 196     Lord Kelvin on the Motion of Ponderable Matter
 the same bulk as the atom, and the same density as the un
 disturbed density of the ether. Thus if the atom, which we
 are supposing to be a constituent of real ponderable matter,
 has an inertia of its own equal to I per unit of its volume,
 the effective inertia of its motion through space occupied by
 ether will be ^-s3(I-p634) ; the diameter of the atom being
 now denoted by * (instead of 2 as hitherto), and the inertia
 of unit bulk of the ether being still (as hitherto) taken as
 unit of inertia. In all that follows we shall snppose I to be
very great, much greater than 10* ; perhaps greater than 1012.
    § 15. Consider now, as in § 11 above, our atom at rest;
and the ethor moving uniformly in the space around the
atom, and through the space occupied by the atom, according
to the curved stream-lines and the varving velocities shown
in fig. 5. The effective inertia of any portion of the ether
containing the atom will be greater than the simple inertia of
an equal volume of the ether by the amount ^ g* "634.       This
follows from the well-known dynamical theorem that the
total kinetic energy of any moving body or system of bodies
is equal to the kinetic energy due to the motion of its centre
of inertia, plus the sum of the kinetic energies of the motions
of all its parts relative to the centre of inertia.
   § 16. Suppose now a transparent body— solid, liquid, or
gaseous—to consist of an assemblage of atoms all of the same
magnitude and quality as our ideal atom defined in § 2, and
with I enormously great as described in § 14. The atoms
may be all motionless as in an absolutely cold solid , or
they may have the thermal motions of the molecules of a
solid, liquid, or gas at any temperature not so high but that
the thermal velocities are everywhere small in comparison
with the velocity of light. The effective inertia of the ether
fier unit volume of the assemblage will be exceedingly nearly
 he same as if the atoms were all absolutely fixed, and will
therefore, by § 15, be equal to
                             l + N?p-634                   (15),
where N denotes the number of atoms per cubic centimetre
of the assemblage, one centimetre being now our unit of
length. Hence, if we denote by V the velocity of light in
undisturbed ether, its velocity through the space occupied by
the supposed assemblage of atoms will be
                       V/(l + N?j>-634y.        .   . . , (16).

    § 17. For example, let us take N= 4 x 1020 *; and, as 1 find
suits the cases of oxygen and argon, s=l*42xl0~8, which
gives N £-a8="60 x 10~s. The assemblage thus defined would,
if condensed one-thousand-fold, have '6 of its whole volume
occupied by the atoms and *4 by undisturbed ether; which is
somewhat denser than the cubic arrangement of globes
(space unoccupied =1— ^-=*4764), and less dense than the
densest possible arrangement (space unoccupied = 1 — —~ =
•2595). Taking now N ^*3=- 60 xlO"3 in (16), we find for
the refractive index of our assemblage 100019, which is
somewhat smaller than the refractive index of oxygen
 (1-000273). By taking for K a larger value than 100 in (11),
we could readily fit the formula to give, in an assemblage in
which "6 of the whole space is occupied by the atom, exactly
the refractive index of oxygen, nitrogen, or argon, or any
other gas. It is remarkable that according to the particular
assumptions specified in § 5, a density of ether in the centre
of the atom considerably greater than 100 times the density
of undisturbed ether is required to make the refractivity as
 great as that of oxygen. There is, however, no difficulty in
admitting so great a condensation of ether by the atom, if we
are to regard our present problem as the basis of a physical
hypothesis worthy of consideration.
    § 18. There is, however, one serious, perhaps insuperable,
difficulty to which I must refer in conclusion: the recon
ciliation of our hypothesis with the result that ether in
the earth's atmosphere is motionless relatively to the earth,
seemingly proved by an admirable experiment designed by
Michelson, and carried out with most searching care to secure
a trustworthy result, by himself and Morleyt- 1 cannot
see any flaw either in the idea or in the execution of this
experiment. But a possibility of escaping from the conclusion
   * I am forced to take this very large number instead of Maxwell's
19X101", as I have found it otherwise impossible to reconcile the known
viscosities and the known condensations of hydrogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen with Maxwell's theoretical formula N«2= —-— x^ ='3989^,

         Electrostatic Field. By Louis T. More, Ph.D., Adjunct-
         Professor of Physics in the University of Nebraska^.
    MUCH attention has been attracted to the so-called expan
               sion of a dielectric in an electrostatic field, as it has
    beeu deemed an experimental proof of the theory of Faraday
    and Maxwell, and many investigators have experimented on
    it —notably, Fontana ||, Crovilf, Duter**, Righift, Quincke^,
   and Roentgen§§. The results, as given by them, although many
    contradictions are noted, are, that most liquids and glass
    expand in volume when subjected to electrostatic stress, and
    that glass also expands in a direction normal to the lines of
    induction. These increments are considered too large to be
    accounted for except by a new and peculiar property of
    electricity. No experiments have yet been made on the
    behaviour of glass coinciding with the lines of induction.
    These results have been generally adopted ; for example—
     See J. J. Thomson, ' Applications of Dynamics to Physics
    and Chemistry,' page 52 et passim, and Poineare, L'electricite
     et I'optique, chapter xiii. And they have been adduced as an
     experimental confirmation of Faraday's theory. Roentgen,

by former investigators, and from experiments of his own,
believes that these observed changes of volume and length
are to be accounted for by electric compression of the elec
trodes and the heating effect of the electric charge. In
support of this opinion, that at least part of the effect was
due to the former, it should be noted that in every case there
has been an abrupt change of potential at the surface of the
dielectric. This would necessitate the action of free charges
on the surface of the glass or liquid, and the attraction of
these charges would produce changes in volume. In general,
from the arrangement of the apparatus, it would cause an
apparent expansion.
   My principal aim in these experiments was to prevent any
free or apparent charges on the surface of the dielectric and
so obviate this criticism. As for temperature changes, they
were said to be slower in action than the electrical strains,
and so separable. If a solid dielectric, as glass, were charged
by electrodes not in contact with it, and if the spaces inter
vening were filled with a liquid non-conductor of the same
or nearly the same sitecific inductive capacity, it is evident
that the potential gradient between the charged plates would
be uniform and there could be nothing like a free or apparent
charge on the surface of the glass. After a number of
apparatus were tried, the following was found best to answer
the purpose.
   A brass tube (fig. 1, p. 200) 61 centim. long, 4 centim. inner
diameter, and 4 millim. thick, was screwed and then soldered
into a heavy iron plate. This, in turn, was fastened by
screws into a ring of hard wood. Around the base of the
tube a collar of brass 3*5 centim. high was soldered. The
glass tube to be tested was then passed over the inner cylinder
and sealed with sealing-wax to a height of 4 centim. This
tube had a length of 57~5 centim., inner diameter 5*2 centim.,
mean thickness 2-5 millim. A third tube was fitted over these
two. It consisted of three pieces, the middle part of brass,
44 centim. long, 3'5 millim. thick, 6-3 centim. inner diameter,
and two end-pieces of glass which fitted tightly over the
brass tube as shown in the figure. The three were then sealed
together, and the whole, in a brass ring screwed to the iron
base. This arrangement of glass anil metal was for the
purpose of insulating the brass part when the latter was
charged. To prevent leakage the outer surface was painted
with shellac. Great care was taken, when putting the apparatus
together, to make the axes of the three cylinders coincide.
The spaces between the cylinders could be filled with various
liquids as desired. A thin laver of mercury, poured between

the tubes, prevented the dissolving of the w;ix. Of different
cements (such as yellow lead dissolved in glycerine, plaster
of Paris, shellac) sealing-wax held well and was convenient
to manipulate.
    The magnifying arrangement of the deflexion consisted of
ii system of optical levers (fig. ii). The light from a Wels-
bach burner was placed behind a metal screen pierced with a
 round hole one centimetre in diameter ; fine glass fibres were
stretched horizontally across this opening. The light, after
being deflected at a right angle by a totally reflecting prism,
 passed through an achromatic lens to a mirror mounted on
a three-legged table and then, upon reflexion, back again,
through the lens and on past the prism either to one side or
above. The lens had a focal length of a metre ; as the screen
was at that distance from it, the image of the fibres was also
at a distance of a metre. The mirror, in position, is shown
in fig. 1. Dimensions are in centimetres. As arranged, a
vertical displacement of the image accompanied a change in
the length of the glass tube.
   The tilting-table ami mirror (fig. 2) consisted of a small
brass plate, 1*7 centim. square, with three legs made from the
finest needle-points. The mirror was 2'5 centim. high and
 1"4 centim. in width, and was silvered on the face and back.
The effective distance between the needle-points was 6 millim.
The image of the fibre was finally ol»served in a cathetometer
microscope provided with a vertical motion micrometer screw.
One division measured a deflexion of 1/200 millim.
    One division of the micrometer is equal to a change of
length of

              2 x 1000     200
The microscope could be set to a quarter of a division. In
using such a system it is advantageous to increase the stability
of the mirror by lowering the centre of gravity of the tilting-
table considerably below the needle-point. Without such an
arrangement it is very sensitive to external vibrations, but by
passing over the top of the table a yoke carrying leaden
weights of 20 grams, all vibrations are prevented and even
hard jars disturb the image but for an instant. The image
during observing was perfectly steady, and after a deflexion
returned to the original position accurately.
   To adjust the position of the reflected ray of light, a solid
brass cap was screwed into the upper end of the inner brass
cylinder (fig. 1), the top extending out so that it left a space
of about a millimetre between it and the glass tube. One leg
                                                                 ^.

202       Dr. L. T. More on the Sujjjiosed JSlomjaiton of
of the tilting mirror rested on the glass and the other two on
the brass tube, or vice versa. By screwing the cap up or
down a proper level of the mirror could be readily obtained.
   Finally the entire apparatus was rigidly fastened to a system
of heavy beams fitted on a brick pier in a basement room
where the temperature was reasonably constant.
   The inner tube was always connected with the ground both
at top and bottom, and since the metal legs rested on the head
of the tube, the silvered front and back surface of the mirror
was also uninsulated. A sheet of card-board covered with tin
foil fitted closely to the top of the glass tube, and on being
grounded prevented any direct attraction between the mirror
and the charged electrode. The outer brass tube, or else a
covering of tinfoil on the outer surface of the glass tube, as
the case might be, was charged by a powerful electric machine
capable of giving a spark, of great volume, eight or more
inches in length. One pole of the machine was grounded.
A Lane unit jar, with a spark-micrometer of brass balls two
centimetres in diameter, was included in the circuit and oue
ball grounded. The jar stood near the apparatus, that there
might be little difference of potential between the tubes. The
fall of potential along the entire line was so small that the
sparks passed as readily between the balls of the jar as be
tween those of the machine. When they were set at the same
distances, sparks usually passed simultaneously.
   To test the sensibility of the apparatus several experiments
were made by determining the elasticity of the glass tube. A
table was prepared with three legs that rested upon the top of
the glass tube alone, on which weights could be laid. The
results of a set of readings are given below. As the only
object was to test the sensibility of the apparatus, the experi
ment was performed without especial care to avoid changes of
temperature or other causes which affect the zero-point when
a sensitive arrangement is used.

   The first column gives the absolute elongation ; the second
indicates the gradual change of the zero. The mean deflexion
is about double for the increased weight. The modulus of

   From the value of Young's modulus obtained, it is evident
that the mirror recorded changes of length approximated
correct. The three cylinders were then adjusted, the inter
vening spaces filled with a non-conducting fluid and the outer
one charged. The series of experiments descrilied are from
a very large numlier of attempts extending over more than
two years.
   The etherial salts of acetic acid are liquids of approximately
the same specific inductive capacity as glass, which was tin-
solid used. Butamyl acetate, having about the same resistance
as the others, did not hold a sufficiently high charge. I then
decided to try kerosine, which though of a less inductive
capacity, yet would reduce the surface charge on the glass
by half. With this liquid sparks of two centimetres were
gotten.     In spite of great care, I was troubled by the fact
that when the outer cylinder was charged the glass was
l>ent laterally. This lateral liending was easily recognizable,
as it caused the field to move laterally and at the same time
either up or down. By placing the tilting mirror on opjiosite
sides of the rim of the tube opposite effects would lx* observed.
The lateral motion was accompanied at times by an up or
down motion of ten or twenty divisions of the micrometer.
Occasionally, for the apparatus was adjusted many times, the
lateral effect was rendered quite small ; a few times eliminated,

great as twelve millimetres, or about 33,000 volts. With a
perfectly straight tube, 55 centimetres long, a lateral motion
at the top of 0*013 centimetre causes a vertical displacement
of one division *.
   Supposing that the potential was not groat enough, it was
resolved to confirm the work of former investigators. The
outer cylinder was removed, the space between the glass and
inner brass cylinders filled with acidulated water, and the
middle of the outer surface covered with tinfoil 45 centi
metres long. In no case could 1 observe any elongation or
contraction. A comparison with the results of Righi and
Quincke shows that an elongation of at least ten divisions
should have occurred.

of my micrometer equals 1*5 x 10-5 millim., so that the former

    With this arrangement higher potentials were not used as
the electricity leaked from the tinfoil to the base of the
apparatus. For this reason, still leaving the tinfoil on the
glass, the outer brass cylinder was put in place and a metallic
connexion made between the two so that they should be at
the same potential. On filling the intermediate space with
kerosene a spark-length of two centimetres was obtained. At
   * By bending the glass tube slightly by mechanical means, it was easy
to confirm the statement, that if the tube bent the image of the fibres
moved laterally and at the same time vertically. When the force was
removed the image returned accurately to its original position whether
one or two legs of the tilting mirror were on the glass tube.

this potential / Hill got no deflexion although the lowest calcu
lation from Bighi's results should have given me i58 divisions.
The time of charging was varied from almost immediate
sparking to a gradual increase of potential that lasted
occasionally five minutes or more. Just at the time the spark
passed there was often a sudden jar of the image, sometimes
 up and at other times downward. This could not have been
 mistaken for the phenomenon expected. A calculation from
 Quincke's results and formula show that this potential should
 have given at least 20 divisions. Thus by the observations
 of both experimenters I should have obtained a large deflexion.
 After a series of experiments with these high potentials the
 glass was ruptured, so that the limit of possible strain was
 re-ached. During the course of the experiments four tubes,
 of the best German Thuringian glass, were used to l>e sure
 that it was not a special case of a single specimen.
     I next tried a hard rubber tube in the same manner as tin-
 glass. The outer cylinder was put in place and the spaces
 filled with kerosene. The specific, inductive capacities of the
 two are about the same, so that the potential gradient between
 the charged plates was practically a straight line. The sensi
 tiveness of the apparatus was so great that gradual changes
 of temperature caused the image to move slowly across the
  field. With sparks up to seven millimetres no change in
 length was noted, except the jar before mentioned at the time
 the spark passed. This motion was too rapid to be measured,
 but I guessed it to be about seven divisions. The time of
 charging was varied as in the experiments with glass. It is
  stated that this substance elongates about ten times as much
 as glass*.
     These results, so far at variance with the statements of
  former investigators, have caused me carefully to study their
  methods and results, and one cannot but be impressed with
  their discrepancies. Consider first the work on change of
  volume. The method employed was to charge a conducting
  liquid in a glass thermometer and to observe the change of
  volume of the glass by the rise or fall of the liquid in the
  capillary tul>e.
     The experiments give the following results. Govi found
  that when the internal liquid was water the height fell, show
  ing an increase in the volume of the glass. With nitric acid
 a greater change was observed than with water, and with
 alcohol a much greater change than with nitric acid. Ether,
 when charged, rose in the tube and then fell ; mercury anil
 olive-oil showed no effect. Duter, experimenting later, states

that there is always a fall in the tube which is entirely hide
pendent of the kind of liquid in the thermometer. Quincke
observed an effect analogous to Govi's, but when the bulb
alone was filled with a different liquid and the capillary
always with pure water, the variations were eliminated. He
concludes that the variations were due to differences of sur
face-tension, capillarity, viscosity, and electric conductivity.
But it should be noted that his original variations were in the
reverse order to Govi's, as the change with water is here
greater than with alcohol. Mercury often showed no change,
and turpentine never. In the table*, inserted here for
reference, he gives this effect for water and mercury, but
unfortunately impairs the value of his deductions by not
using the same thermometer in the two cases.

The first table is for the case when liquid fills both the bulb
and the capillary ; the second, when water alone is used in
the capillary. It will be seen that the variations are not
accounted for, and indeed Quincke states that this remaining
variation must be due to the difference of the conductivity
for heat of the two liquids. But this is hardly an adequate
explanation, as the variations in the second table are greater
for the smaller charges of electricity. It also seems to cast
a doubt on the cause of the expansion, for if the relative con
ductivities for heat of mercury and water can change an
observation from 0*51 to 0*75, the entire heating effect of the
charge might well cause serious changes in the amount of
deflexion observed.
   Experimenting with changes of volume in liquid dielectrics,
Quincke found that most of them expand when charged, but
that others, as the fatty oils, contract, ltoentgen repeated
these experiments, using two different methods, and found in
no case a contraction. He finally concludes that all cases
may be accounted for by an increase of the temperature, and
the attraction of the charged surfaces.

   Relation between drains and thickness of dieledric : —
l)uter found the volume, at the same potential-differences,
to increase inversely as the thickness within a probable error
of five per cent. Kighi confirms this from his experiment on
glass tubes, but Quincke, using lwth thermometers and tubes,
finds the increase to be inversely proportional to the square of
the thickness. This is in accordance with Maxwell's formula
for the strain in the medium. In support of this law he gives
on page 190 a table for changes of volume, and on page 382
for changes in length. Changes are in millionths of the
original dimensions.            An examination of the table shows
that errors in this law are very much greater than the sensi
bility of his apparatus warrants, especially in tubes whose
thickness varies to a considerable extent.

   To account for some of these discrepancies it is important
to compare their apparatus with mine. In the first place, as
 Eighi and Quincke used a system of rigid mechanical levers
all lateral distortions, which were so prominently in evidence
in my experiments, would show in theirs as a change of
lengtn alone, resulting from the bending. This would be

 208        Dr. L. T. More on the Supposed Elongation of
 especially noticeable in Quincke's method, which was to
 stretch fine glass fibres horizontally lietween two supports.
 He also gives prominence to the tact, that i£ a bent glass
 tube, or one not uniformly thick, be used there is a large
 amount of distortion due to the non-uniformity of the field.
 This irregularity must also occur when thermometers are
 employed, as it is naturally difficult to blow a bulb perfectly
 spherical, and also everywhere uniform in thickness. Quincke,
 on page 190, states, " that thermometer No. 34 had a bulb
 of somewhat irregular shape and wall thickness, so that the
 inner portions of the bulb on electrification would be especially
 affected. It is therefore not comparable with the others, and
 is included only because it shows the greatest change of
 volume which I have been able to observe in glass." This
 thermometer showed an expansion of 68*36 where No. 9 of
 the same glass, of practically the same thickness and with
 the same difference of potential, gave only 5*277. This great
 difference due to irregularity of shape makes one wonder
 whether the expansion of No. 9 might not partly result from
 the same causes. Also heating effects would be less evident
 in my experiments as the thicker glass and lower potential
 gradients employed would reduce this effect.
    B'rom the results of my experiments, taken with the con
 flicting evidence of former investigators, it is not probable
 that the stress occurring in the aether when a dielectric is
 electrostatically charged causes a mechanical deformation of
 the substance. At least if there is such an action it must be
 extremely minute—perhaps a slight rearrangement of the
 molecular structure—as an effect so large as one expressed by
 the formula KH2/87T could not have escaped my notice.
 Though it might have been expected that such aethereal
 stresses would change the length of a dielectric l>otn along
and at right angles to the lines of induction, yet as one of
 these is a tension and the other a compression of equal amounts,
it is difficult to see how any change of volume other than a
differential effect would result, whereas Quincke finds that
the change of volume is nearly three times as large as the
linear expansion.
    In conclusion, the evidence that the stress in the aether
denoted by Maxwell's formula KH2/8w is accompanied by a
mechanical strain resulting in the deformation of the charged
substance, is also not verified by experiments in allied fields
of investigation. We may not infer from the Kerr effect of
dielectric double refraction that such a mutual action exists,
since the Kerr effect may be either positive or negative.
Some dielectrics, as glass, give an effect equivalent to a

              a Dielectric in an Electrostatic Field.          200
mechanical compression along the lines of force, and others,
as resin, a mechanical expansion ; whereas Maxwell's formula
in all cases calls for tension alone.
   Let us suppose that the Kerr effect can be explained by a
mechanical compression produced by the charged electrodes.
   The following calculation makes clear that this deformation
is not sufficient to produce the observed changes of length
normal to them :—
   Let           V=2 cm. spark=130 c.g.s. units.
                d =0-25 cm.
                K=5.
                 E=3xlOn,
   Then        F/S = K(^~/u)* = 54000 dynes.
    The change of length along the lines of force equals
        ? x rf/E = 54000x ^f-5 x 10-" = 4-5x 10"8cm.
 From Poisson's ratio of 0"25, the change of length normal to
the lines of force equals 1-1 X 10-8 cm. My tube was 57 cm.
long, giving a total change of length of 0*3 x 10-6 mm. This
corresponds to less than half a division of the micrometer-
screw and hence could not have been observed.
   From experiments of D. B. Brace* on the action of a mag
netic field upon transparent media—" We may also conclude,
according to Maxwell's view of the state of polarization and
stress in such a medium, that the pressure at right angles to,
and the tension along, the lines of force (equal in both cases
to H2/8w) affect the propagation of light by an amount less
than 2"0 X 10-14 \ for a C.G 8. unit of intensity per centimetre."
   Note.—In 1895 the writer published an articlef "On the
 Changes in Length of Iron Wires by Magnetization," and,
induced by his interpretation of Maxwell's theory, he made a
 correction for an elongation due to the strains in the medium
 proportional to B2/8tt, which materially altered the interpreta
 tion of the results obtained. The paper aroused some criticism
 which appeared in volume liii. of ' Nature.' Dr. Chree and
 Dr. E. Taylor Jones argued that the true correction was a
 contraction. Professor J. A. Ewing wrote :—" For some time
 I have been aware that the passage referred to in my book on
 the ' Magnetic Induction in Iron ' requires correction. The

magnetic stress B2/8tt, is there spoken of as if it were of the
same nature as a simple longitudinal stress of compression,
producing a contraction of the length in consequence of the
elasticity of the metal But I see no ground for treating this
purely hypothetical strain as a ' correction ' to be applied,
either one way or the other, to the observed changes of
length." Mr. L. R. Wilberforce concurred in this opinion.
To answer these criticisms it was necessary to devise an
experiment that would isolute this effect from all others. As
I saw no way of doing this in the case of iron I turned to the
analogous case of a dielectric in an electrostatic field ; for
since Quincke had stated that the variation in the length was
proportional to H3/87T, it seemed that most of the effect was
due to this stress. My recent experiments compel me to
think that my original correction was erroneous and that
Professor Ewiug was right.
     XV. On a Theorem analogous to tlie Virial 'Theorem.
                    By Lord Rayleigh, F.R.S.*
AS an example of the generality of the theorem of
         Clausius, Maxwell f mentions that " in any framed
structure consisting of struts and ties, the sum of the pro
ducts of the pressure in each strut into its length, exceeds
the sum of the products of the tension of each tie into its
length, by the product of the weight of the whole structure
into the height of its centre of gravity ahove the foundations."
It will be convenient to sketch first the proof of the purely
statical theorem of which the above is an example, and
afterwards of the corresponding statical applications of the
analogue. The proof of the general dynamical theorem will
then easily follow.
   If X, Y, Z denote tho components, parallel to the axes, of
the various forces which act upon a particle at the point
x, y, z, then since the system is in equilibrium,
                     2X=0, 2Y = 0, SZ = 0.
If we multiply these equations by .v, y, z respectively, and
afterwards effect a summation over all the particles of the
system, we obtain a result which may l>e written
                  2[.r.2X+.y.2Y+c.SZ]=0. . . . (1)
   The utility of the equation depends upon an alteration in
the manner of summation, and in particular upon a separation

act mutually between two particles along their line of

 where in the first summation X, Y, Z represent the com
 ponents of the Jxtemal. forces operative at .the point .r, y, z.
  In Maxwell's example the only external forces are the weights
  of the various parts of the system (supposed to be concen
  trated at the junctions of the struts and ties), and the reactions
 at the foundations.
      The analogous theorem, to which attention is now called,
  is derived in a similar manner from the equally evident
  equation
                       S[.r.SY + z/.2X]=0                         (3)
   We have to extract from the summation on the left the force
   It mutually operative between the particles at x, y, z and at
   x', y1, :'; and we shall limit ourselves to the case of two
   dimensions. If X, Y be the components of force acting
   upon the latter particle, p the distance between the particles,
   and <f> the inclination of p to the axis of x, we have
                   Y(a>- x) + XKy'-y) = -Rp sin 2<p ;
   so that if now X, Y represent the total external force acting
   at .r, »/, (3) becomes
                    2[.BY+^X]-rSR/»sin2^) = 0.          ...        (4)
    where the first summation extends to every particle and the
    second to every pair of particles.
       If the external force at x, y be P and be inclined at an
    angle a, we have
                       X = Pcoso, Y = Psina;
    so that, if x=r cos 8, y=r sin 0 as usual, (4) may be written

       As simple examples of these equations, consider the square

that occurs is that which acts along the diagonal where
sin 2<f>= — 1. In fig. 1 opposed forces P act at the middle
points of the sides, but since in each case 0 + a = O, the terms
containing P disappear. Hence R = 0.

    In fig. 2, where external forces P act diagonally at the un
connected corners, sin (6 + a) =— 1, and since p — 2r, R= — P,

In neither case would the weight of the members disturb the
conclusion.
    The forces exercised by the containing vessel upon a liquid
confined under hydrostatic pressure p contribute nothing to
the left-hand member of (4). The normal force acting inwards

 cannot be the general case of the long wave. It has, on the

   XVII. Cosmic Evolution. By Prof. A. W. Bickkkton *.
  IN this paper the term galactic system will mean not only
       the milky way, but also the caps of nebulse at its poles.
  The term milky way will be used to imply the galaxy itself.
  The term cosmic system will be applied to aggregations of
  dimensions comparable to the Magellanic clouds and to our
  own galactic system. (In my earlier papers these masses
  were called universes; but Lord Kelvin and Lord Rayleigh
  independently pointed out that this name might mislead, I
  have consequently substituted cosmic systems.) The term
  cosmic system of the first order applies to aggregations
  without definite structure, in which no general collision has
  occurred. In systems of the second order, a single general
  collision has taken place, and the symmetry is perfect. All
  other cosmic systems are of the third order. In these more
  than one general collision has occurred, and there is too much
  symmetry to be of the first order, and too little symmetry to
  be of the second. The visible universe (the galactic system
  of which our solar system is a part) is consequently a system
  of the third order.
     The group of recently-discovered monatomie elements that
  have no combining power, namely, helium, neon, argon, crypton,
  and xenon, I call cosmic pioneers. They are practically

  always independent atoms, and probably play an important
  part in laying the foundation of an incipient cosmic system,
  helium being the most important. Possibly these elements
  have no other function than this, as deductions from their
  properties suggest that they must largely pass out of cosmic
  systems before the system matures. Hydrogen plays the
  same initial part, but it is more than a cosmic pioneer; it has
  important functions in cosmic systems of all orders.
     This paper is chiefly devoted to grazing and whirling
  collisions of celestial bodies.
     Grazing collisions of stars were discussed before the Royal
  Society by Dr. Johnstone Stoney more than thirty years ago.
  The formation of double stars and new stars by such an
  occurrence was suggested by him, as well as the probability
  of the existence of dead suns in countless hosts.
     The especial point I wish to forward is that a grazing
 impact will generally result in the formation of a new body,
 whilst the two struck stars proceed on their journey ; as it
  were, flint and steel have struck and have cut off a part from
 each other, that results in an intensely heated spark.
     Because the non-colliding parts are but little affected bv
 the collision I call such a phenomenon a " partial impact.''
     With stars of the same order of dimensions that our sun
 has, the velocity developed by mutual attraction will be
 hundreds of miles a second. When by impact this motion is
 converted into heat in the coalesced parts, the temperature
 will be practically the same, whatever the amount struck off;
 if the graze be small, the attractive power of the new body will
 also be small, and it is evident that the velocity of the molecules
may be great enough for every molecule to have more than
 the critical velocity; each molecule a* it reaches the surface
 will consequently leave the body, never to return.
    The temperature may easily be from ten to a hundred
million centigrade. It will of course vary with the chemical
composition.
    Thus is produced in less than an hour a fiery mass
expanding about a million miles an hour, and this increase in
size will cause for a time an increase in brilliancy. Presently,
however, the radial direction of the molecules will tend to
cause their motion to become parallel, and will lessen the
number of molecular encounter*, and consequently the
amount of radiation, so that after a time our bright star
becomes a planetary nebula. In a year or so each molecule
is wandering alone ; the brilliant body and the nebula are
gone. The body has lost its light, not by cooling, but by
being too hot to hold together.

   218       Prof. A. W. Bickertou on Cosmic Evolution.
      The two stars that struck have been heated where they
   ¦were sheared, find they are separating at a speed of
   hundreds of miles a second. Hence the spectrum of our
   nova is mnde up of a continuous spectrum, with broad,
   bright, indistinct bands produced by the expanding gas, and
   on this b;ind are superimposed two other lines, bright or dark,
   dependent on the position from which we view the lake of
   fire produced by the impact.
      Obviously the tangential retardation will cause rotation,
   and the cut stars may alternately show their light and dark
   faces. Thus two variable stars are produced at once ;
   generally this variability will tend to die out more quickly in
   one than in the other, yet there are many such pairs still
   existing.
      It is certain that such pairing is not the result of chance.
   Whatever the explanation offered to account for variable
   stars must account also for the existence of pairs. (The
   accompanying diagram represents such a series of phenomena.
   With bodies of solar density the time taken to produce the
   changes shown in the series is less than two hours. The mass
   of the bodies makes no difference in the time, as with bodies
   of equal density the velocity acquired by gravitation is pro
   portional to the diameter.)
      The middle body attracts and retards the escaping stars,
   and may wed them into a pair.
      Then, were no other agency to come into play, the pair
   would return to impact again, but long before they attain
   aphelion distance the central mass (consisting as it does of
   gas above the critical velocity) will have fled into space.
      Hence the only force that attracts the stars back again is
   their own mass, and consequently, instead of colliding, the
   stars move in the ordinary double-star orbit. Double stars,
   when first connected, would be variable, and would be
   associated with nebula? ; this is actually the case, and any
   satisfactory account of double stars must explain these facts.
      If the two stars had had a considerable proper motion they
   would not have been orbitally connected, and they would
   constantly increase their distance from each other.
      This is doubtless the condition of the nnassociated variable
  stars that are in pairs, and it is possible that their increase in
  distance could be observed.
      Supposing too much had been cut off and coalesced, and
  the attraction were consequently too great for the heat to give
  every molecule more thnn its critical velocity; on attaining
  equality of temperature the light atoms would rob the others
  of their energy and escape.

  Hydrogen at the same temperature has sixteen times the
tendency to escape that oxygen has, and two-hundred and
eight times that of lead. This tendency of the chemical
elements to sort themselves I call " selective molecular
escape."
   Hence at every cosmic impact of dense bodies some light
molecules leave with such extreme velocity as to escape not
merely the mass, but the galactic system altogether. These
molecules wander in space, perchance to other cosmic systems.
   Another agency is at work giving motion to free molecules.
Radiant energy is caught by cosmic dust of all dimensions.
Sir W. Crookes's experiments on " Radiant Matter " suggest
that free molecules do not take up or give out radiation.
(Dr. Johnstone Stoney has lately suggested to me that this
point is unimportant, as even should the molecules absorb
radiation, this energy will increase the velocity of the suc
ceeding rebound.) But when slowly moving light molecules
touch this heated dust, it will bound off in the same way
that molecules fly with increased velocity from radiometer-
vanes. Thus radiant energy is converted into heat, and this
into potential energy.
   There are other agencies by which light atoms are liberated
from cosmic systems to wander indiscriminately.            Such
atoms do work against the attraction of systems, and where
potential is highest they move slowest.
   Where they thus linger they tend to accumulate. The
potential of this part of space lessens, and the work required
to reach these positions not being so great as at first, oxygen
and other heavier molecules get there, increasing the density;
and oxygen also tends to produce non-volatile compound
molecules.
   These would coalesce ; but helium and the other cosmic
pioneers do not combine, they remain permanently gaseous.
Thus a primary cosmic system is incipient. Dense bodies
sent out of cosmic systems by the interaction of three bodies
would generally pass through old cosmic systems where matter
is in dense masses, but evidently not through such vast
gaseous aggregations as the incipient cosmic systems. The
bodies would be retarded by the friction produced, and
perchance volatilized, forming nucleii in the general mass ;
their mutual attraction would cause denser aggregations to
occur, and a cosmic system of the first order would be
produced. Two such systems colliding produce a system of
the second order. This, colliding with any other cosmic
system, produces a system of the third order. Our own
galactic system is very probably a tertiary system.

           Prof. A. W. Bickerton on Cosmic Evolution.         221
   The kinematic condition of the impact would exactly pro
duce such a system. It is now known to be a rough double
spiral of stars, with sprays and streams of stars and two caps of
nebula?. It is not difficult to picture the kinematic conditions
necessary to form such a rough ring, or double spiral of stars
with poliir caps of nebulous matter.
   Let us assume a complete whirling coalescence of two cosmic
systems in which the part coming into collision is considerable.
This heated part is in the centre of the system. Here all the
material is volatilized, and the pressure produced can find no
relief save axially; hence the system is, as it were, a short
cannon open at each end, and the discharged gas spreads
itself over the poles of the system.
   This discharge, that is commenced by pressure, is finished
by molecular escape. Globular nebula? form in this gaseous
matter by the attraction produced by wandering bodies
plunging into the gas. The globular nebula? so produced
attract one another and become double nebula?; they are then
wrought into spindles, spirals, dumbbells, or rings by the
kinematic peculiarities of the varying depths of impact.
   It is significant that temporary stars, planetary nebula?, and
all the bodies likely to be produced by the impact of stars are
in the milky way; and all the forms of nebula? deduced as
resulting from the impact of nebula? are where we should
expect them to be, namely, at the poles of the milky way.
   If this generalization represents the mode of nature's action,
then there is a possibility that the entire cosmos is immortal,
and the present order but a phase of an eternal rhythm.
   The sequence of these agencies is as follows: —
       (1) Diffusion of heat by radiation.
       (2) This radiation, falling on the dust of space, heats it.
       (3) The heat of this cosmic dust is taken away by slowly
              moving light molecules having their velocity
              increased.
       (4) Free molecules are also sent out of systems by partial
             impacts, by selective molecular escape, and other
              agencies.
       (5) Free molecules will remain longest in the position of
              maximum potential where their motion is least, and
              will consequently tend to aggregate in the empty
              parts of space.
       (6) By the interaction of three bodies the velocity
              acquired by one sometimes takes it out of the cosmic
              system.

      (7) Hydrogen and the cosmic pioneers then become a
            trap for wandering bodies that tend to be stopped
            ami converted into dense nebulae.
      (8) These dense nebulae tend to attract surrounding gas;
            they cool and shrink, some ultimately forming solid
            bodies.
      (9) These bodies, by mutual attraction, give density to
            the new cosmic system.
     (10) Such systems are of the first order.
     (11) The impact of systems of the first order produces
            systems of the second order.
     (12) Any other impacts produce systems of the third order,
             of which our gn lactic system is a type.
     (13) The coalescence of two cosmic systems does not neces
            sarily, as a final result, produce a system of a larger
            mass than the two original systems from which it
            was formed, as many agencies are tending to send
             matter out of the coalesced mass.
     (14) It is thus seen that dissipation of energy is but a
            part of a complex cyclical process ; and there is
            consequently the possibility of an immortal cosmos
            in which we have neither evidence of a beginning
            nor promise of an end, the present being but a phase
            of an eternal rhythm.
   The accompanying diagrammatic scheme illustrates these
agencies. It must be noted that bodies and systems are
printed in italic capitals; and where several such are one
above another it implies sequence of phenomena.
XVIII. On some Effects of Twist on the Thermo-electric
   Qualities of Iron. By A. Tsuruta {Tokyo, Japan), in
    Gottingen* .
rpHIS formed one of my old subjects of investigation, in
 J. fact, should have formed the continuation of my papers
published in the ' Journal of the College of Science, Imperial
University, Tokyo.' In 1892 some preliminary experiments,
and in 1895 the present series of experiments, were carried
out ; but as my methods had to be improved upon, and the
results then obtained appeared likely to be corrected in some
or other points, I refrained from having them published along
with the others. Up to this day, however, I have not been able,
and still at present I see no prospect of being able, to execute
my intention. On the other hand there have lately come to
uay knowledge some papers dealing with somewhat allied
                   * Communicated by the Author.

 224             Mr. K. Tsuruta on some Effects of
 subject-matters—for example, G. Meyer's in Wiedemann's
Annalen, and G. Maclean's in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
 Society of London.' Having been thus reminded of my old
 experiments, I have been led to do my best to give now and
 here an account of them, inasmuch as I believe that though
 unfinished and incomplete, yet if communicated to fellow-
 workers interested in such matters, they may not be deemed
utterly worthless. In undertaking this task at a date remote
from the time of actual experiments I cannot feel myself sure
of being free from consequences arising out of a long dis
missal of the subject-matter, although my laboratory-journal,
to collect my materials from, has been kept unimpaired, and
the general features of my result were at that time carefully
written out. The publication of this confessedly incomplete
account will, I hope, call forth my colleagues' criticism and
correction, affording, I doubt not, what 1 myself could not
till now.
    G. Wiedemann, in a paper on " Magnetiscbe Untersuch-
nngen," after remarking that as E. (John has found a thermo
electric current produced in a wire, a part of which is
stretched and the remainder is not, so the same might take
place in regard to twisting, goes on to saj- that he has con
firmed this by experiment, but it is not to be ascertained how
he did so. At the time of my experiments I could find no
paper in which the present subject is systematically treated of.
    The following was one of the arrangements used in my
experiments of lfc>92, and may be considered as corres
ponding to the well-known one of Lord Kelvin's in regard
to the effect of longitudinal tension. A long piece of wire to
be examined, being passed through a brass bar, was clamped
to it at its middle part. One half of the wire could be twisted
bv means of a torsion-head at its free end, the whole being
stretched by means of leaden weights applied to the other
free end. A pair of small circular brass disks was fixed on
the wire near its free ends and dipped into mercury pools
which were connected with the electrodes of a small galvan
ometer. Heat was to be applied at the clamped middle of
the wire. This arrangement, simple and good in principle,
presented many practical difficulties, and so no quantitative
observations were made.
    The arrangement adopted in the year 1895 corresponds in
principle to that adopted by E. (John in his investigation on
the thermo-electric effects of longitudinal tension. A torsion-
head used was constructed in the following way : — Its outer
cylindrical piece, which was to be fixed, had an inner piece
 (also cylindrical) fitting accurately and easy to turn. This

          Twist on the Thermo-electric Qualities of Iron.     225
inner piece had a pyramidal hollow, into which there fitted
accurately a solid pyramid (of course truncated). This latter
consisted of two equal wedges, which had grooves, forming
together a small hole along the axis of the torsion-head, and
of a calibre just sufficient to allow the end of the expsrimental
wire to pass through. A strong screw was to be driven
against the bases of the two wredges, which, on being thus
pushed from behind into the pyramidal hollow, embraced the
end of the wire and held it firmly in position. All was
 made of brass. Thus the trouble of soldering once in each
experiment the eud of the wire to the inner piece was
obviated, but at the same time the wire was laterally and
 considerably compressed— a thing to be avoided as much as
 possible, for though the portion compressed was just next to
 the uncompressed, yet a difference of temperature between
 them (exposed and unexposed to the air as they were) might
 produce disturbance.
    The outer piece of the torsion-head had a shallow trian
 gular groove, cut parallel to its axis and on its outer surface.
 One end of the unaffected part of the experimental wire was
 there put in, and secured in position by a number of turns of
 wire.
     Rigidlv connected with the inner piece there was a cir
 cular disk of very hard wood provided with ten notches round
 its periphery. These notches served the double purpose of
 counting the amount of twist applied and of keeping the inner
 piece so turned in position by means of a side ratchet. It
 was this disk that was taken hold of in twisting, and thus
 the metallic parts were entirely free from possible disturbances
 due to contact with the hands.
     The junction at the other free end of the part to be twisted
  was effected by means of another arrangement very similar
  to the last in construction, except that the outer and inner
  pieces were now made a sliding pair in order to allow for the
  stretching of the whole wire when loaded, and that the end
  of it to be joined was here put between the two wedges side
  bv side with an end of another part which was to be left
  unaffected.
     The two pieces which formed the junctions were firmly
  mounted on a very strong block of wood at a distance of
 about 70 cm. from each other, care being taken to have them
 well centered in order to avoid the production of bends near
 the clamped ends in stretching the wire with weights. This
 centering and necessary adjustments were done carefully
 once for all, for though I had no time to demonstrate, yet it
 was surmised that if any bends were formed in the initial
 act of stretching, and were further subject to frequent

 226           Mr. K. Tsuruta on some Effects of
 twisting and untwisting, the effects anticipated would come
 out considerably complicated, though otherwise simple.
    Heat was applied to the second junction by means of
 steam sent into a hollow vessel of brass surrounding it.
    To begin with, the experimental wire was well annealed,
 and at the same time straightened. It was cut into three
 parts, each of a proper length. The ends of two of these—
 one the longest and to be twisted, and the other to remain
 unaffected —were first fixed to the second junction-piece, and
 put in position. Then the outer end of the part to be twisted
 was passed through the first junction-piece, aud was firmly
 held there, as explained above, with the help of two small
spanners, so as to avoid as much as possible any arbitrary
initial twisting. One end of the remaining third part, which
 was to remain unaffected, was secured in position as ex
 plained above. The free ends of the two idle wires were
 dipped in mercury contained in two test-tubes, and sur
rounded with a large quantity of water, the whole being then
 put in a box with thick wooden walls.
   The galvanometer used was of low resistance, and made
highly sensitive with a controlling magnet or two. The
ordinary arrangement of rocker and six mercury pools
served as commutator, which it was necessary to have on
account of the high sensitiveness of the galvanometer with
incessant changes of zero. The commutator seems to have
been a considerable source of disturbance, as different metals
came here into contact (I had not at that time that form
of commutator which was used in my other investigations).
Absolute measurements of the current produced were, to my
extreme regret, reserved to later occasions ; in the curves given
below the current-strength is indit ated only in scale-divisions.
    In my arrangement there are, it will be seen, many things
which must be improved or replaced by others, some of
which in fact I have put on record in my journal. All these
untried things must be omitted, and of the results I obtained
only the following three points seem to deserve place here.
   (a) As it was thought that thermo-electric effects of twist,
if any, would show themselves more conspicuously in the case
of iron than with other metals, as had been the case with refer
ence to longitudinal tension, it was soft iron that I examined first
of all. The experimental wire was, to begin with, subject to the
tension of some leaden weights, and then it was twisted and
untwisted two or three times by way of drilling ; definitive
observations were then made. The deflexion given as corre^
spondjng to a given amount of twist must be in reality the
result of the superposed deflexions due to longitudinal tension
and twist applied. The pure effect of twist can properly be

           Twist on tlie Thermo-electric Qualities of Iron.   227
gathered from observations with small loads ; but only a few
of such were made —made simply for the sake of sounding,
so to speak.
   In fig. 1 is given a series of observations I obtained early
in the course of my investigation. It
seems to establish the existence of the               Fig. 1.
phenomonon of thermo-electric hyste
resis with respect to twist (in my own
case, combined with a certain amount
of longitudinal tension).
   Starting from the axis of zero twist,
we have an ascending trend and then a
maximum point —a feature which also
exists in soft iron once stretched per
manently and subject to the influence of increasing longi
tudinal tension. This is evidently a result of the interaction
between the hysteresis and the actual and immediate effect
of twist. As the amount of twist is increased, the latter soon
overpowers the former, causing the curve to descend. On
being untwisted the wire seems to respond, yet with the
hysteresis in action. The return br.inch falls below the direct,
continues to ascend even beyond the axis of zero twi<t, and
not far from it attains again a maximum point, which is
almost symmetrically situated with respect to the axis against
the first maximum. Further untwisting produces the same
state of things as on twisting. In short, the whole appear
ance of the curve is very similar to that of the well-known
 curve of magnetization and twist.
    It is hardly necessary to mention after what has been said
above, that as several sources of disturbance were but imper
 fectly eliminated in my experiments, some curves I obtained
 were not so good as the one just cited ; for example, the maxi
 mum points were both found on the
 positive or both on the negative side of
 the axis of zero twist. It sometimes
 happened that one of the cycles gone
 through in succession was shifted
 relatively to the other (fig. 2). This
 may be partly explained by the fact of
 my having merely taken scale-readings.
    It is to- be regretted that I did not
 try many samples of soft iron to see
 whether the hysteresis phenomenon
 does exist in them all. But as the
 samples I tried wore taken at random, it seems exceedingly
 improbable that the phenomenon is confined to them alone.
     (/>) Such, 1 believed, might be taken as tbe normal type tor

228            Mr. K. Tsuruta on some Effects of
soft iron when twisted and untwisted within a moderate-
range and, what is not to be omitted, under a moderate
amount of longitudinal tension. However, 1 then came
across a curious circumstance as 1 went on to widen the
range of twist. Immediately after the curve of fig. 3 a
                           . Fig. 3.
 had been obtained with the same wire and within the same
 range as the previous, the readings plotted in fig. 3 b were
 taken for the range of + 4?r, of course with the process of
 drilling the wire interposed. It will be observed that with
 all the other features the same in both cases, the direct
 branches in the latter are beloie the back branches, while in
 the former their relative positions are reversed.
    As this was discovered in the particular piece of wire
 within the range of twist +27T and +47r, it seemed to me
 worthy of being repeatedly examined even with that par
 ticular piece ; and I made many series of observations on it.
 It may be cited that I tried to get a number of curves for
 different ranges one after another, and each preceded by
 the process of drilling. Thus the following four sets :—
 (1) +10.2f, tig. 4 a; (2) +8.2f fig. 4 b ; (3) +6.^
 fig. 4 c; (4) +4.-?-,rig. 4 d.      The general features of all
 the curves are similar, and the hysteresis phenomenon is

           Twist on the Thermo-electric Qualities of Iron.            229
  apparent. In the first figure the direct and back branches
  are distinctly separated from each other, the former lying
  below the latter. In the second figure the distinction between
                                    Fig. 4.
  the branches becomes less, yet their relative positions are
 maintained. In the third figure the branches cross each
 other, suggesting that the metamorphosis from one type to
 the other is here or hereabout taking place. And in the
 fourth figure we have the type originally obtained, and believed
 to be normal.
     I cannot here help referring to a very similar feature
 discovered in the course of Prof. Nagaoka's magnetic investi
 gations, called by him the "reversal of hysteresis " *.
     I may also cite one of my experiments made on another
 piece of wire cut from the same bundle as the previous, in
 which different ranges of twist were gone through in suc
 cession, and with all the intervening processes of drilling
 omitted. It was to be expected that somewhere in the chain
 the reversal would come into view. Suffice it to state that
 the experiment fully confirmed the expectation.
    Experiments with still another piece, cut from the same
bundle and with the range of twist widened up to + (nr and
 even to +8ir, show that the type of the curves obtained is in
all cases preserved, and that the direct and back branches
become more and more distinct, with the two maximum points
separating asunder the more widely the greater are the ranges
of twist.
    Examination of many different samples is also here
wanting.

230     Effects of Twist on Thermo-electric Qualities of Tron.
   (e) The third and last result I have to communicate refers
to the effect of agitation in the form of brisk tapping, which
is known to be quite marked in the case of longitudinal
tension. The agitation seems to be less effective in the present
than in that case; yet is quite sensible. The two pairs of
curves, figs. 5 a, 5 b, and figs. (> a, b" b, will give an idea of
                                                          («)

the effect. One of each pair refers to a series of observations
made as usual, and the other to the immediately succeeding
one in which there was interposed at some easily distin
guishable point the operation of tapping (namely, with a
wooden rod on the stretched rope by which the leaden weights
were suspended). The former pair has the range of twist
within the critical value of twist for the reversal, while in the
latter it lies beyond it. The effect of agitation seems in both
cases to be opposite on the direct and back branches, on one
side as well as the other of the axis of zero twist ; so that agi
tation has in figs, o the tendency to make the branches approach
towards each other, and in figs. 6' to separate from each
other. Hence it was expected that it might be possible by
continual topping to pass from the second type of the curves
(i. e. after the reversal) to the first (/. e. previous to it). This
seems to have been but partially fulfilled in a few experiments

       On the Action of Copper-Zinc Alloys on Nitric Acid.        231
  tried ; for I find that in some cases the branches only approach
  considerably towards each other, while in other cases they
  merely cross each other, but never entirely reverse their relative
  positions as expected.
      It seems, then, that I was able to show by the above expe
  riments, defective and incomplete as they were:—
      (o) That in soft iron of certain kinds there exists the pheno
  menon of thermo-electric hysteresis with respect to twist (at
  least when combined with longitudinal tension) ;
     (b) That, other things being equal, the hysteresis is reversed
  at a certain twist ;
     (c) And that mechanical agitation has its own effects, which
  are reversed as the hvsteresis is reversed.
 XIX. On the Want of Uniformity in the Action of Copper-
     Zinc Alloys on Nitric Acid. By Dr. J. H. Gladstone,
     F.R.S.*
 MUCH attention is being directed at the present time to
           methods by which it may be possible to determine the
 heat evolved in the formation of alloys. Among these methods
 is that of the dissolution of filings of the alloys of copper and
 zinc in nitric acid, as compared with the dissolution of mixtures
 of the two metals in the same proportion. This method has
 been objected to by more than one chemist on the ground that
 there is no assurance that the same substances, and in the
 same relative proportions, are produced in each case. As my
 name appears on the British Association Committee which
 has adopted this method, 1 have felt myself under an obliga
 tion to make some direct experiments on the point.
    In the Report of this Committee, " On the Heat of Com
 bination of Metals in the Formation of Alloys," read at the
 Dover Meeting of the British Association (Report, 1899,
 p. 246) a table is given containing details of a long series of
observations, which show the heat developed during the action
of nitric acid on copper and zinc in various proportions, both
when the metals are mixed together and when they are in
combination as alloys. The difference of heat between the
solutions compared has been regarded as a measure of the
heat evolved by the combination of the metals in forming the
alloy.
    The alloys experimented upon by Dr. Gait are twenty-two
in number. The results are set out in a table, and plotted in

       They show at first a pretty regular decrease in the calories
       from the 1432 evolved by pure zinc towards the 604 evolved
        by pure copper. But after the alloy containing 20 per cent.

         the Action of Copper-Zinc Alloys on Nitric Acid.      233
  of copper, a more rapid and irregular decrease takes place till
  we arrive at that containing 38 per cent, of copper. From this
  point, or rather from copper 3838 per cent., there is a gradual
  and fairly regular descent to the amount of heat evolved by
 pure copper.
     The somewhat similar series of experiments conducted by
  Mr. Baker (Proc. Chem. Soc, Sept. 1899) is exhibited in the
 lower part of the same diagram, the resulting calories being
 plotted in the same way from 1399 down to 579. There is a
  fairly close resemblance between the two series, except that
 in the latter the most rapid decrease of heat does not take
 place till at about 54 per cent, of copper.
     Through the kindness of Lord Kelvin 1 obtained three
 specimens of the alloys employed in Dr. Gait's experiments ;
 the first containing 205 per cent, of copper and 79;*i percent,
 of zinc, the second 38-38 per cent, of copper and 6T62 per
 cent, of zinc, and the third 49" 1 per cent, of copper and 509
 per cent, of zinc. The first and second specimens are not far
 from those which show the greatest divergence in opposite
 directions in the amount of heat evolved ; in the third the two
 metals are very nearly in atomic proportions. In dissolving
 these in nitric acid I followed essentially the process employed
 by Dr. Gait, with the precautions mentioned by him.
    As is well known, the reaction between nitric acid and
 these metals or alloys is very complicated, producing nitric
 and nitrous oxides and nitrogen, evolved as gases but which may
 be partially or wholly absorbed ; while the liquid is found to
 contain, in addition to the undecomposed acid, nitrous acid,
 and nitrates or nitrites of the metals, and in some cases
 ammonium salts.
    The gases have already been the subject of examination by
 several experimenters. Messrs. Acworth and Armstrong
 (Journ. Chem. Soc. 1877, p. 54) showed that in the case of
 copper in nitric acid the gas obtained is almost entirely nitric
 oxide, while in the case of zinc it is mainly a mixture of
nitric and nitrous oxides in very nearly equal proportions.
In an experiment with brass they obtained practically the
same result as with copper alone. As far then as the gases
are concerned, the chemical action of copper and of zinc on
nitric acid is not the same ; and the insignificant quantity of
the nitrous oxide when brass is dissolved suggests an essential
difference in the reaction between the alloy and the mixed
metals.
    It did not seem necessary to repeat the experiments of
Armstrong, especially as the permanent gases evolved in
Dr. Gait's experiments were small in quantity, at any rate in
the case of the yellow alloy. My attention has therefore been

 234    Dr. J. H. Gladstone on the Want of Uniformity in
 mainly confined to determining the substances remaining in
 solution, i. e. the nitrous acid and the ammonia.
    The following Table gives the results; they represent in
 each case the amount produced by one gramme of metal,
 mixture, or alloy, as the case may be. Usually 0-4 gramme
 was dissolved in nitric acid, and the resulting solution was
 divided into two equal parts for determining the nitrous acid
 and ammonia respectively. The figures given in the Table
 are the mean of several observations, which were generally
 fairly accordant, calculated for one gramme. To these are
added the results of two specimens of commercial brass of
higher percentage of copper.

       the Action of Copper-Zinc Alloys on Nitric Acid.            235
    Two results stand out prominently from the above figures.
    1. The chemical action of the alloys is very different from
 the chemical action of the corresponding mixtures of filings.
 It will be seen by a glance at Table I. that the alloys give
 much more nitrous acid and very much less ammonia than
 the corresponding mixtures. In fact, two of these alloys give
 practically no ammonia.
    2. On comparing the figures for the mixtures of solutions
 in Table II. with the solutions of mixed metals in Table I., it
 will be seen that there is a notable difference both in regard
 to the nitrous acid and to the ammonia. This might be
 anticipated from the fact that, when the copper and zinc
 filings are mixed together, they form what has been described
 under the name of the " copper-zinc couple." The two
 metals in juxtaposition and touching at a multitude of points
 while surrounded by acid set up a more vigorous action, with
 different chemical results and no doubt a different evolution
 of heat*. It is probably this action which causes Dr. Gait's
 numbers for heat of mixtures to lie generally below the
 theoretical straight line joining zinc and copper in the
 diagram accompanying the report of the Committee.
    The chemical objection therefore is well founded. It is a
very serious one ; but is it necessarily fatal ?
    Would it not be possible to take some particular alloy,
determine the products of its action on nitric acid, and their
 relative proportions, and then determine the number of
 calories which would be produced theoretically in the
 reaction ? If they agree closely with the number of calories
 found by Dr. Gait and Mr. Baker, there is no room for
 supposing that the amount of heat evolved in making the
alloy is to be determined by this method. If, however, the
 two calculations differ, there is a residual phenomenon to bo
explained.
    But here we encounter two difficulties.
    1. Though we may know the ultimate composition of all
 the specimens of copper-zinc alloys experimented upon, pro
bably not one of them is a truly definite compound. Each of
them may consist of two or more alloys with some uncom-
bined zinc or copper, as the case may be. A microscopical
examination is generally sufficient to show that each is more
or less heterogeneous in its character. Sir W. Roberta-
Austen's table of the freezing-points of alloys of copper and
zinc also indicates the mixed nature of almost every specimen
   • See Journal Chem. Soc., April 1878, where the experiments of Prof.
Thorpe and of Gladstone and Tribe on the production of nitrite and
ammonia by means of the copper-zinc couple are described.

236     Dr. J. H. Gladstone on the Want of Uniformity in
examined. The alloy Cu 38"38 per cent, appears, however,
to he pretty uniform.
    2. Supposing, however, that we had the true constitution
of the specimen and the exact products of the chemical action
hoth in solution and as gases, there would still remain an un
certainty about the number of calculated calories. The original
 determinations of Thomsen and the recent ones published by
 Berthelot are very discrepant ; and the various corrections to
 be made, especially in regard to the gases, are too uncertain
 to admit of any trustworthy comparison within the niirrow
 numerical limits with which we have to deal.
    There is, however, another method of comparison which
 appears to be more promising. Although Thomsen and
 Berthelot differ as to the calories produced by any particular
 reaction, there is one point on which they practically agree ;
 that is, the excess of calories in a zinc reaction over those in
 the corresponding copper reaction. Thomsen makes it for
 one gramme 750 calorics, Berthelot 756 calories, which i6
 a practical agreement (say 753 calories). Starting from
 601 calories, the value, according to Gait, when pure copper
 is dissolved in nitric acid of sp. gr. T360, we should have
  1357 calories when pure zinc is dissolved, provided the
 chemical action were the same in each case ; and all the calori-
 metrical results from the different specimens of alloy would
 theoretically lie, not upon the line drawn in Dr. Gait's
  diagram, but upon the straight line drawn between 604
 and 1357. On referring to the diagram, we see that the
 little crosses fairly coincide with this line from pure copper
  to about the Cu 70 alloy, but beyond that there is less heat
  produced than the mean indicated by the straight line, the
 maximum deviation being at about Cu 37. Beyond that point
  the heat gradually augments, exceeding the mean at about
  Cu HO, with a somewhat irregular progress to 1432 calories,
  the amount experimentally obtained by Gait from pure zinc,
  —an excess or as much as 75 calories above the theoretical.
 The diagram of Baker's experiments shows the same general
  result, with the difference previously referred to.
     Reference to Table I. will show that the products of
 decomposition of the nitric acid between pure copper and the
  Cu 38*38 per cent, alloy give nearly the same amount of
 nitrous acid in each case (representing about 80 per cent,
  of the possible amount), and practically no ammonia. The
  remaining 20 per cent., or thereabouts, consists mainly of
  nitric oxide. As the products in each of the rive cases seem
  to be the same, and nearly in the same proportions, we should
  expect that the amounts of heat evolved would form a pretty

       the Action of Copper-Zinc Alloys on Nitnc Acid.          23?
regular progression between copper and the above alloy,
following closely the theoretical line. We see a fair ap
proximation to this in the diagram, but there is a gradual
divergence from the line, indicating a deficit of heat. The
specimen containing 3838 per cent, of copper, which is not
far from the predominant alloy CuZn2, shows a loss of
32 calories. Baker's experiments show almost exactly the
same amount of loss of heat, though at a somewhat different
place in the series.
   The only way in which, as far as I can see, this residual deficit
can be explained on chemical grounds, is by supposing that the
action of this alloy upon nitric acid produces a larger amount
of nitric oxide than in the case of pure copper. Tabic I.
gives some indication that this may be the case, because the
amount of nitrous acid produced is rather smaller in the
alloys than with the metal itself, indicating that there must
be more of some other product, presumably nitric oxide.
But, allowing full force to this argument, it cannot account
for as much as 10 calories of the deficit. There is in any
case a residual deficit as yet unaccounted for on chemical
grounds, and which may be regarded as the amount of heat
evolved in the formation of the alloy.
   The action of zinc, or of the alloys rich in zinc, upon
nitric acid is very different. There is less nitrous acid formed,
while ammonia and nitrous oxide are produced in consider
able quantities. The substitution of ammonia for nitrous
acid will not make much thermal difference ; but as the
calories obtained by the formation of nitrous oxide are at
least 175 more than with nitric oxide, and 83 more than with
nitrous acid, there does not seem any difficulty in accounting
 for the excess shown between the observed and calculated
values for pure zinc, or for the alloys containing more than
 70 per cent, of this metal.
    The work both of Dr. Gait and Mr. Baker has evidently
 been carried out with the greatest care; but, considering the
 uncertainty of the thermo-chemical data and the great
physical interest attaching to the research, it would seem
highly desirable that further experiments on the copper-zinc
alloys should be made with solvenls which give a chemical
action far more simple than that produced by nitric acid.
    In concluding, I desire to acknowledge the great assistance
 Mr. flibbert has rendered me in this inquiry.

XX. On the Velocity of Solidijication and Viscosity of Super
   cooled Liquids. By Harold A.Wilson, B.A. (Camb.),
   D.Sc. (Loud.). M.Sc. {Vict.), 1851 Exhil.ition Scholar,
    Allen Scholar. Cambridge University*.
IX the following paper an account is given of a series of
      experiments, the object of which was to obtain infor
mation on the influence of the viscosity of a supercooled
liquid on its rate of solidification. When solidification is
started in a supercooled liquid, rays of solid grow in the
liquid with a definite? velocity the relation of which to the
initial supercooling has been determined t for a numl>er of
substances, e. g. phosphorus and benzophenone. In consi
dering the nature of the observed relation between the velocity
and the supercooling, it is important to take into account the
production of heat which accompanies the solidification, and
which must raise the temperature of the surface at which the
solidification takes place ; so that the observed relation may
differ greatly from the relation between the velocity and the
temperature of the solidifying surface.
    In a previous paper " On Velocity of Solidification " J I
have shown that the general character of the relation ob
served between the velocity of solidification and the super
cooling of the liquid can be explained in detail by supposing
the solidification to be due to the difference between the
internal pressures in the liquid and solid, and that the mole
cules at the surface of separation between the solid and
liquid are urged from the liquid into the solid by this differ
ence in the internal pressures. Using the method given
by Van't H off for calculating the osmotic pressure of a salt
in solution from the depression of the vapour-pressure, and
making certain assumptions described in detail in the paper
just referred to, the following formula for the velocity was
obtained:—
where v is the velocity of solidification, F the latent heat of
fusion of one gram of the solid, A the force required to give
unit velocity to one gram of the liquid diffusing through
itself, a the thickness of the layer of molecules at the sur-

lace of separation of the liquid and solid in which the fall
of pressure takes place, 0O the melting-point on the abso
lute scale, and 9 the actual temperature at the surface of
separation.
   If we regard F and a as constants and A as being propor
tional to the viscosity of the liquid, we can write the above
formula thus :
where (J is a constant, *=#„— 0 the actual supercooling, and
V is the viscosity of the liquid.
   Since V increases as the temperature Falls, v may attain a
maximum value and then fall when s is increased.
   The experiments described in this paper were undertaken
with the object of testing the formula v = C ^j and they show
that the main features at any rate of the observed relation
between the velocity and temperature can be deduced from
the results for the viscosity by means of this formula. In
fact, when the constant C is so chosen as to make the maximum
value of C=y equal to the maximum value of the velocity, then
the values of C=r> agree fairly well with the observed values
of the velocity.
   To find the extent to which the temperature of the soli
difying surface, or rather that of the tips of the growing
rays of solid, is raised above the original temperature of the
liquid, experiments were made in which a thermocouple was
immersed in the liquid, and the change in its temperature
observed as the boundary between the solid and liquid passed
it. The substance first used was salol, which was chosen
because it solidifies very slowly (maximum velocity about
4 millimetres per minute), so that the thermocouple has a
chance of taking up the temperature of the surface of
separation.
   The salol was contained in a glass U-tube which was im
mersed in a water-bath at constant temperature, and the
thermocouple was put down one of the limbs of the U-tube.
The couple used was made from iron and nickel wires each
0'2 millim. in diameter, which were twisted together for
about 2 millims. and kept apart by a thin capillary of glass
round the iron wire. The iron and nickel wires dipped into
small mercury cups kept in the same water-bath, from which

  240     Dr. H. A. Wilson on the Velocity of Solidificatian
 copper wires led to a very dead-beat mirror-galvanometer
  read by a telescope and scale. A deflexion of about 3 millim.
 divisions was obtained for a difference of temperature of
  one degree between the couple and the mercury cups, so that
  £ of a degree could be measured easily.
     The salol was first melted by means of hot water, and then
 the U-tube was fixed in the bath and the couple put halfway
 down one limb. When the salol had taken up the tempe
 rature of the bath, solidification was started in the other limb,
 and the galvanometer observed as the surface of separation
 passed the couple. A millimetre-scale was fixed to the
 U-tube, so that the temperature of the couple and its position
 with respect to the surface of separation could be observed
 simultaneously. The following series of observations were
 obtained in one experiment: —

1-3 millim. per minute. The maximum temperature was
always indicated in the time during which the couple was

in the experimentjust described this time was about 18 seconds.

   These results are shown graphically in fig. 1. It will be
observed that the velocities are not the same at the same
temperatures in the two tubes ; but when the correction in
dicated by the thermocouple is applied, the two curves
become approximately identical. The wider tube had thicker
walls than the narrower one, which of course would render
the escape of the heat developed more difficult in the wider
tube, which accounts for the greater rise of temperature found
in it.

               and Viscosity of Supercooled Liquids.            243
wider glass tube forming an air-jacket was tried. This was
found to diminish the velocity considerably, as we should
expect owing to the increased difficulty with which the heat
developed could escape. Thus with the water-bath at 32°
the velocity•' with the additional tube was 088 mm. ~," and without
the additional tube it was M m^.
                                   mm.
   To test the validity of the formula v = C ^, the viscosity of
supercooled salol was measured at a number of temperatures.
The apparatus was of the ordinary form, consisting of two
small glass bulbs connected by a capillary and bont round
into a U-shaped tube. The time required by the meniscus
of the liquid to pass between two marks, one above and one
below the upper bulb, was determined whilst the apparatus
was fixed in a water-bath at a known constant temperature.
The capacity of the upper bulb was about 2 cub. cent., and the
time for water at 15° C. was 24"5 seconds.

   The formula « = Cw indicates that the velocity should in
crease proportionally to the supercooling when it is small.
Now the relation observed between the velocity and super

cooling usually shows a very small rate of increase of velocity
when the supercooling is small. This is shown in fig. 1, where
the velocity- curve produced cuts the axis of temperature at
37 , whilst the melting-point of the salol was about 41o,0.
ktill some indications of partial melting occurred at about 37°;
and it is very probable that if the substance were quite pure,
then the very small rate of increase of tho velocity near the
melting-point would not occur. Tanjmann (loc cit.) has shown
that purifying a substance always diminishes this region of
small velocity ; and conseepjently, for the purpose of testing
the formula v = Cy, I have measured the supercooling from
the point (37°*0) at which the velocity-curve shown in fig. 1
cuts the temparature-axis.

the velocity (v) and viscosity (V) were taken at 22°, at which

   The agreement between the found and calculated values of
r is sufficiently good. The independence of the velocity and
the temperature from 15° to 25° thus appears to be due in
this case to the viscosity being approximately proportional to
the supercooling between these limits of temperature.
   The formula r = C^ thus represents the variation of the

              and Viscosity oj Supercooled Liquids.          245
 velocity with the temperature at which it takes place in a very
 satisfactory manner in the case of salol.
    In the case of substances having greater velocities of soli
 dification than salol, it is not easy to determine the rise in
temperature during solidification. I have made measure
ments of the viscosity and velocity of solidification of super
cooled salol, benzophenone, benzoic anhydride, and azobenzol,
for which measurements of the velocity have also been made
by Friedlander and Tammann (loc. cit.), and my results for
the velocity do not differ much from those given by them.
Benzoic anhydride has a maximum velocity of about 35 22S1 •
so that the thermocouple would only be in the boundary for
0-6 sec, which is probably not long enough to enable it to
take up the temperature at the boundary.
   Anotber difficulty was that the galvanometer available had
rather a long period of swing, so that it could not be used for
measuring so sudden a rise of temperature. An attempt was
made to increase the time during which the couple was in the
boundary, by moving it along with a velocity nearly equal to
the velocity of the boundary; and an apparatus was made
which automatically did this. Unfortunately, however, the
motion of the couple in the liquid nearly always caused it to
solidify, and the couple became fixed in the solid. I believe
that this could be prevented by taking care not to allow the
wires from the couple to carry any of the liquid into the cold
air above the bath, and by heating the couple with the liquid
for a long time ; but I am not able at present to devote any
more time to these experiments, and shall therefore simply
ase the results obtained to test the formula v = C^ without
correcting for the rise in temperature during the solidi
fication.
   The following Tables give the results obtained with
benzoic anhydride. The velocity was measured between two
marks 10 cms. apart on a tube 0*3 cm. in diameter. The
apparatus already described was used for the viscosity
determinations.

248      Dr. H. A. Wilson on the Velocity of Solidification
rise in temperature due to the solidification has not been
 dlowed for. It may be that the rise in temperature is
less when the velocity of solidification is greater; and so
neglecting the rise may not make much difference. The
calculated value of v at 18° C. is smaller than at 22° C, so
that at 18° 0. the supercooling is greater than that for which
v is a maximum. Hence the temperature of the solidifying
surface is probably* raised by the heat developed to the
temperature at which v is a maximum ; so that when the
bath is below this temperature the actual temperature at which
the solidification takes place remains constant, consequently
observations on the velocity cannot really be made at any
lower temperature unless the temperature is so low that the
latent heat of solidification is not enough to raise the tempe
rature up to that at which the velocity is a maximum. Hence
the calculated values of the velocity will not agree with the
 uncorrected values found apparently below the temperature
at which the velocity is a maximum except so long as the
calculated velocity also remains practically constant at the
maximum value.

 250    On Solidification and Viscosity of Supercooled Liquids.
    It thus appears that the formula v = C = represents the
 variation of o with s sufficiently well to justify the conclusion
 that the velocity is largely determined by the viscosity in the
 way indicated by the formula.
    Two main causes, to which I have already referred, probably
 a .'count for the discrepancies between the values of C y and
 the velocities observed. The first cause, namely, the rise of
temperature due to the production of heat accompanying the
 solidification, does not affect the comparison of the calculated
and observed velocities in the case of salol, for in this case
it was measured and allowed for ; but with the other three
 bodies investigated the temperatures at which the velocities'"
are measured are too low, owing to this effect. If the cor
 rection for this effect were made, it would probably raise the
point at which the straight part of the velocity-curve when
produced cuts the temperature-axis, so that measuring s from
this point probably partly eliminates the error due to this cause.
    The other cause, namely, the presence of impurities in the
substance, probably accounts for the small velocities observed
near the melting-point, which I have not attempted to reprer
sent by the formula, and which occur with three out of the
four substances investigated. When impurities are present,
solidification near the melting-point is more correctly de
scribed as crystallization from a strong solution, and must
evidently depend on the rates of diffusion of the substance and
impurities in each other, for as the pure substance separates
out the impurities collect round it ; and so it is easy to see
that the rate of solidification may be greatly affected by small
amounts of impurities quite insufficient to have a corre
sponding influence on the viscosity of the substance. That
purifying the material is able to diminish greatly the range of
temperature over which the velocity increases very slowly
with the supercooling has been shown by Friedlander and
Tammann (loc.cit.), so that it seems reasonable to suppose that
with pure substances the velocity would be at first propor
tional to the supercooling, as the formula C ^ indicates, and
as is approximately the case with the benzoic anhydride I used.
    I think, therefore, that the above results render it probable
that the velocity of solidification of a pure substance varies
directly as the actual supercooling at which the solidification
occurs^ and inversely as the viscosity of the liquid.

    XXI. Theory of the Constant-volume Gas-thermdmetef.
               By J. Rose-Innes, M.A., B.Sc*
PiPHE importance which the constant-volume gas-ther-
 -L mometer has assumed in practical physics justifies an
attempt to improve the theory of the instrument.
    Manipulation of the Fundamental Differential Equation.
   In the customary theory of the constant-volume ther
mometer we start with the differential equation
                        <(£), --»!•
and after dividing by ts we integrate with respect to t. The
integration is of necessity along an isopiestic owing to the
occurrence of the term ( tt ) •       The result of integration
involves an arbitrary function of p, and in order to evaluate
this function we imagine the integration carried to infinite
values of v and t along the isopiestic. This plan has been
adopted by Lord Kelvin (Reprinted Papers, vol. i. pp. 429-
430) and by subsequent investigators ; it is also employed in
this paper published by me " On Lord Kelvin's Absolute
Method of Graduating a Thermometer " (Phil. Mag. xlv.
pp. 232-233).
   The weak point of this method is that we have to assume
that JK^- is known at all temperatures, and that an empirical
formula, which happens to fit the Joule-Thomson results
fairly well throughout the small range of their experiments,
necessarily holds at any temperature however high. An
extrapolation to infinity of the above kind must inevitably
introduce some uncertainty into the results obtained. But it
is possible to abolish this extrapolation by properly trans
forming the differential equation before integrationi
   We start from the fundamental equation
                       /da—™!-
   In order to get rid of the isopiestic differential coefficient
we ma}r employ the relation

   Again, if we put ^r for the product pv we have
                      •(&--'+£),•
   The quantity I -j- I may conveniently be removed to the
 other side of the equation ; we thus obtain

    If by any method we are enabled to express the right-hand
 side or this equation in terms of v and t, the integral of the
 equation will give us the connexion between p and / at con
 stant volume without an extrapolation to infinity. In order
 that t may be a linear function of p when v is kept constant,
 the necessary and sufficient condition is that the right-hand
 side of the equation should be a function of v onlv.
    The quantities JK^-and \J£\ are both measurable for
 several substances ; in the cases of hydrogen, nitrogen, and

             the Constant-volume Gag-thermometer.          253
air they are both found to be very small.   Consequently their
sum JK^— + I j^-J is also a small quantity ; and if we use
an approximate equation in finding the value of (-/- ) we
shall only be introducing errors corresponding to squares of
small quantities.
    Now if             pv = Rt
we have                                               . .

Employing this approximate value for I — 1 we obtain
    It is fnrther shown by experiment that for hydrogen,
 nitrogen, and air, the quantities
                        JK* and ($h
                            dp      \dp Jt
 are nearly independent of the pressure, and depend on the
 temperature only. Consequently to our present degree of
 approximation, the quantitv
 mav be taken as a function of the temperature only ; and in
 order that the constant-volume thermometer may give readings
 in accordance with the thermodynamic scale we must have
 the values of
                          »!<U+2666>(£).
 varying inversely as the absolute temperature.
        The Absolute Value of the Freezing-point of Water.
    We may apply the formula obtained in the last section to
 the determination of the absolute value of the freezing-point
 of water. Estimates of the value of this important physical
 constant have already been given by Lord Kelvin (Reprinted
  Papers, vol. iii. p. 177), but his figures are based on the
 results of experiments with the constant-pressure gas-ther
 mometer.

254            Mr. J. Rose-limes on the Theory of
 - A careful determination of the increase of pressure of
hydrogen at constant volume from the freezing-point to the
boiling-point has recently been made by M. Ghappuis
 {Travaux et Memoires du Bureau International, tome vi.
p. 10&; see also Everett, 0. G. S. System of Units, p. 115).
The pressure at the freezing-point was 1 metre of mercury,
and the increase of pressure was "366254 of a metre of
mercury. If we could treat hydrogen as a perfect gas we
should therefore obtain .,,.,. .. . or 273O-034 as the absolute
value of the freezing-point.
   But it is of course necessary to inquire how far we need a
correction owing to the deviation of hydrogen from the laws
of a perfect gas ; for this purpose we tike the equation
              '(!).->--«!©-(£),•

ire treat the substance as a perfect gas; in the case of
hydrogen at an initial pressure of 1 metre of mercury we
have already seen that its numerical value is 273034. The
ierm _ M±il(< — 10) gives us the thermodynamic correction
          Pi —Po
necessary on account of the deviation of the behaviour of the
substance from the laws of a perfect gas ; it can be calculated
 when »„ Po, M, and N are known.
    In order to discover the values of the mean quantities M and JN
 accurately, we require to know in what way the two quantities
                     «&(£). »J (2).
 respectively vary with the temperature ; such knowledge we
 do not at present possess. It is certain, however, that M
 must be less than the largest value of
                             JK £U0t
  which occurs between f0 and tu and similarly N must be less
  than the largest value of ( j^      which occurs between /0 and
  t . We are thereby enabled to calculate a superior limit to
  each of the corrections corresponding to M and N re
  spectively ; and in the case of hydrogen we find that these
  corrections must be very small—so small that we may safely
   employ some rough method of finding the mean in order to
   reach the values of M and N. The errors introduced by
   taking an approximate mean instead of the true mean
   would not exceed the uncertainty involved in the value of
   . Po    tt,—t0) owing to the ordinary errors of experiment.
   ^For the purpose of calculating M we must employ the
   measurements, made by Joule and Kelvin, of the heating-
   effect which occurs when hydrogen is passed through a porous
   plug      The heating-effect amounted, at temperatures from
    4° 0 to 5° C to 0°-100 0. per 100 inches of mercury; and
    at temperatures from 89° C. to 93° C. it amounted to 0C-155 C.
    per 100 inches of mercury (Reprinted Papers, vol. in.
    p 175). If the heating-effect had been constant and equal to
    the smaller of the two values quoted above, the value of
    M would have been "000505 of a metre of mercury; if the
    heating-effect had been constant and equal to the larger of
     the two values, then M would have been -001025 of a metre

 256            Mr. J. Rose-Innes on the Theory of
 of mercury. The value of M may be fairly taken as '000765,
 the arithmetic mean between "000505 and '001025.
    For the purpose of calculating N we may employ the
 results of M. Amagat, who examined the relation of the pres
 sure to the volume of various gases when the temperature is
 kept constant. In the case of hydrogen, the range of tem
 perature of his experiments was from 17°" 7 C. to 100°"1 C.
 He plotted the values of po against/), and found that within
the limits of temperature of his experiments the isothermals
 could be treated as a set of parallel straight lines. It is not
possible to accept this conclusion as absolutely correct. For
if the isothermals at all temperatures were taken as repre
sented by a set of parallel straight lines, there would be no
critical state, liquefaction would be impossible; and we should
never have pv decreasing as p increases. We may therefore
infer that M. Amagat's law is only an approximation, and
that at higher temperatures pv really increases rather more
rapidly with p than at lower temperatures. M. Amagat con
siders that the value of \-f-) is 00078 when the unit of
volume is the volume occupied by the gas under standard
conditions. It is perhaps safest to attach this number to the
isothermal of 50° C; we then obtain for (d-j£\ at 50° C. the
value of — "001215 of a metre of mercury, which pressure
may also be taken as equal to N.
   The resulting value of M+N is —"000450 of a metre of
mercury; and the corresponding correction for t0 is 0°"123.
This yields as the final value of /„ the figure 273°" 157, which
is very close to the estimate derived by Lord Kelvin from
the constant-pressure air-thermometer (Reprinted Papers,
vol. iii. p. 177).
      The Characteristic Equation of a nearly Perfect Gas.
   We have already seen that for substances like hydrogen
and air the equation
reduces (o
and we remarked that the condition necessary and sufficient
to make t a linear function of p when v is kept constant is

            the Constant-volume Gas-thermometer.          257
that the quantity in curly brackets should vary inversely as
the absolute temperature. An examination of the experi
mental results obtained with such gases shows us that
JK^—J- (-t^) is a positive quantity which decreases as the
temperature increases ; and it is quite consistent with the
experimental evidence to assume that JK 5— + 1 -^- J actually
varies as the inverse temperature, making due allowance for
the unavoidable errors of experiment. At the same time the
measurements that have been made do not enable us to assert
that the proposed law has been proved ; it is conceivable that
JK^— + I -r'- ) decreases rather more rapidly than the inverse
 temperature.
   The simplicity of the proposed law, and its close approxi
mation to the truth, render it interesting to examine what
further deductions can be made therefrom. We start svith
the equation
              '(£).-'=-•<$),-(£),•
and then suppose that the right-hand side of the equation is
found by experiment to be equal to -5, where \ is a constant.

    The Difference between Joule's Method and Lord Kelvin's
              Method of Testing Mayer's Hypothesis.
    The formula obtained in the first section may also be
usefully employed to exhibit the precise connexion between
Joule's method and Lord Kelvin's method of testing Maver's
hypothesis. The language of most text-books on this subject,
is far from satisfactory ; it is often implied that Lord Kelvin's
method is the same as Joule's except as regards delicacy;
and the relation between the two methods is never given
rigorously.
    Mayer's hypothesis consisted in assuming that for common
air and some other gases thu amount of heat given out by the
 gas during an isothermal compression whs exactly equal to
 the work done. Evidently, if this is so, there can be no change
of energy during an isothermal compression ; and we have
 the energy remaining constant whenever the temperature
 remains constant. This hypothesis was put to the test of
 experiment by Joule, and roughly verified. Joule's apparatus
 consisting of two large copper vessels is well known ; and it
 is evident that his experiment tests Mayer's hypothesis directly.
 For if the temperature remains unaltered, as Joule found to
 be the case, the gas has received no heat and done no work,
 so that it has not gained any energy from surrounding objects;
 hence the constancy of temperature is accompanied by the
 constancy of energy.
    The thermodynamics of Joule's experiment are easily given ;
 we have in all cases
                   dK = kdt+ {'(jf)-?} dv-
  (See Daynes's 'Thermodynamics,' p. 88.) Joule's result
 shows that dE and dt are zero simultaneously, while dv does
 not vanish ; hence we obtain

   260    On the Theory of the Constant-volume Gas-thermometer.
      The quantity t( -Jj\ —p is therefore proved to be zero in so
   far as we can treat Joule's result as free from experimental
   error.
      The great flaw in Joule's method is that it is not sufficiently
   delicate, and a sensible deviation from Mayer's hypothesis
   might occur without being detected. Lord Kelvin consi
   derably improved Joule's apparatus as regards delicacy, but
   he also changed the theory of the experiment. The equation
   given in his writings as applying to his form of the experiment
   is
                        •(&--«!¦
   so that when no change of temperature is observed we should
   have
                             it),—°-
      This condition is not necessarily the same as
      The precise manner in which the fall of temperature
   occurring in Lord Kelviu's form of the experiment may be
   made to test Mayer's hypothesis, is easily deduced from the
   formula obtained in the first section. Since
   we see that for Mayer's hypothesis to be true it is necessary
   and sufficient that
       Boyle's law is not rigorously fulfilled by any actual sub
    stance ; hence we see that Mayer's hypothesis would be
    actually disproved by finding no change of temperature in
    the gas which had come through the porous plug.

             XXII. Torsion- Structure in the Alps.
                  By John Buchanan, B.Sc*
IN an article with the above title (' Nature/ Sept. 7, 1899),
      Dr. Maria M. Ogilvie has given an outline of some of
the results to which her observations in the field have led her.
   I have here attempted to examine the application of some
of the ideas there set forth to the case of a plastic, or quasi-
plastic sheet. Let us imagine such a sheet to be subjected to
forces of compression parallel to its surface. For our present
purpose we may treat the sheet as incompressible. The
resulting deformation of the sheet will be a series of corruga
tions, each corrugation consisting of an arch and a trough.
The axes of these corrugations will on the average be, at
each point, perpendicular to the direction of the force at that
point. What will be the result if the sheet be now acted on
by another set of compressive forces again parallel to the
surface, but in a different direction from the first set ?
   Evidently, this second set of forces would tend to give rise
to a new series of corrugations, which in turn would tend to
have their axes everywhere at right angles to the direction of
these forces. The actual result obtained at any point will be
that due to the combination of the displacements which each
set of forces would separately produce, the combination being
effected by the parallelogram rule.
   We will now proceed to consider the result of superposing
a regular series of corrugations on another regular series, the
two series being combined according to the method just
indicated. In order to show the bearings of the method, two
comparatively simple cases are here dealt with.
   Case 1.—Let us assume the original corrugations of the
sheet to be parallel to one another, and equally spaced, with
their axes lying say east and west. Let now the second
system of compressive forces act inwards towards a centre, so
that, if alone, they will be assumed to give rise to a series
of equally spaced concentric circular corrugations. The
resultant curves are what Dr. M. M. Ogilvie has called
" torsion-curves." Those figured in fig. 1 are confocal para
bolas ; the focus is the centre of the circular corrugations.
So long, however, as the spacings are regular in the two sets
of corrugations, the torsion-curves in case I are always con-
focal conies. Fig. 1 shows also how it is possible for the
superposed system to cross the original corrugations at all
angles from 0° to 90°.
   In the more general case where the spacing of the circles
and of the parallel lines is irregular, it would appear that each

                      Mr. J. Buchanan on
portion of the torsion-curves would be part of a conic whose
focus is the centre of the concentric corrugations.
                              Fig. 1.
    The general resemblance between the curves in fig. 1 and
 the torsion-curves drawn by Dr. M. M. Ogilvie for the Peri-
Adriatio area of subsidenoe is evident (Quart. Journ. Geol.
 Soc. Aug. 1899, p. 630).
    It may be pointed out also that since an area of subsidence,
 such a trough as the Adriatic for instance, is an area of
 weakness, the contraction of the earth's crust due to secular
cooling would tend to move the torsion-curves more and more
 closely towards this region as time goes on. The average
 direction of motion at each point will bo the direction of the
 force of compression at that point. The torsion-curves wjll
 on the average arrange themselves at right angles to these
 forces of compression. Now, the curves which are orthogonal
 to a system of confocal conies are themselves conies confocal
 with that system, Hence, if the torsion-curves, at any time

assume the form of confocal conies round an area of sub

spaced parallel system.

   The resemblance of these curves to the spiral, or " whirl-
shaped " arrangement of the various Alps is undoubtedly
very suggestive. Here also, as in case 1, the superposed
system crosses the original system at all angles from 0° to 90°.
   In order not to confuse the figure I have shown only the
positive branches of the curves.
   As is shown in the appendix, the radial system cf corruga
tions would require the forces, to which it would be due, to
have a direction at right angles to the radii, and of magnitude
inversely as the distance from the centre.

    (a) The curves shown in fig. 2 have some interesting
properties. Those figured are drawn so that the angle be
tween two consecutive radii is 10° ( = To )•
    It is easy to see that the equation to the system can be
 written
                        y = xian^(x— c)                       (1)
 where c is a constant for each curve, but varies for different
 curves : its value is marked on each curve shown.
    (b) If we assume that the curves are normal at each point
 to the resultant force at that point, then if X and Y represent
 the component forces, we can write
                             dy _ X                           m
                             dx~~Y                            W
 From (1) we have

                  x
                  ?
  where r' = x'i+ya.
     Thus, by means of (2), we may put

                        Y= K.J,

     2. ' The Lower Ludlow Formation and its Graptolite-Fauna.'
  By Miss Ethel M. R. Wood.
     After dealing with the literature of the stratigraphical and
  paleeontological sides of the subject, the author passes to a full
  consideration of the sequence and character of the Ludlow Rocks
  in the following localities :—The Ludlow district, the Builth district,
  the Long Mountain ; and gives a briefer account of those of the Dee
  Valley, the Lake district, Southern Scotland, Dudley, and the Abberley
  Hills. While the Wenlpck Shales are characterized by Cyrtograptus
  and by the Flemingii-tyye of Monograptus, in the Lower Ludlow
  Shales the colonus- and spinose forms of Monograptus such as M.
  chimara are abundant . The line between Lower and Upper Ludlow
  is drawn at the top of the Aymestry Limestone. The Lower Ludlow
  Rocks are divided into five graptolitic zones, which are not constant
  in character or thickness in the different areas. The distribution of
  the zones is given in the annexed table (p. 266). Two of the zone-
  graptolites are new species, described in the latter part of the paper.
     In the Ludlow area the two lowest zones are rich in graptolitos,
  but shade into each other, and are therefore less clearly defined than
  the higher zonen, which each contain practically only ono species
  and are lithologically distinct. In the Builth area the variation in
  the zones in different parts may be due to the conditions of depth
  and current under which the graptolites have been deposited, or to
  the overlap of higher beds on lower, as has been shown to be the
  case with the Wenlock and Old Red Sandstone rocks. In the Long
  Mountain syncline, M. scanicus is practically absent, and the

 typical M. Isintwardineniis of the highest zone has not yet been
 found, although its place appears to be taken by a varietal form.
 Two new species of graptolites are almost confined to this district.
The succession worked out in these districts is confirmed by that in
the Dee Valley and the Lake District, but the evidence at present
obtained in the three other areas is only scanty.
   The Lower Ludlow sediments become thicker, coarser, and more
arenaceous when traced from the south and south-east to the north and
north-west ; but, in spite of this, there is a striking constancy in the
lithological sequence of the sediments. Only two of the graptolitic
zones, those of At. NiUsoni and At. leintwardinensis, are present in
all the districts. A table is given to show the distribution of the
graptolites in Britain and Europe, and one showing the order of
appearance of the graptolites of the formation.
   The Lower Ludlow graptolites present, as a whole, the following
peculiarities, and stand in marked contrast to those from the Wenlock
liocks in the fact that while the polypary is straight for the greater
part of its length, it is distinctly curved inwards at the proximal
extremity. The apertures of the thecal are for the most part either
spinose, or wholly devoid of ornamentation. The number of species
is eighteen, with thirteen varieties, of which six species and nine
varieties of Atonograptus and one species of Retiolites are new, and
are described and figured in the paper. All the species and varieties
of Monograptus are arranged round type-species into six groups.
The richest groups in species and varieties are those of M. dabius
and At. colonus. Most of these groups link the Ludlow Series with
Wenlock, and even the genus Retiolites is common to the two
formations. Thus the supposed great pakeontological break between
the two Series to a great extent disappears.

   1. ' Additional Notes on some Eruptive Rocks from New Zealand.'
By Frank Rutley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The rocks described in this paper were, with a few exceptions,
collected by Mr. James Park. A few of the specimens come from
the area of the Hauraki Goldfields, but many of them were pro
cured from other localities in the North Island, including several from
Rotorua. The silica-percentages of several of the rocks have been
determined by Mr. P. Holland.
   The first part of the paper deals with twenty-three rook-6pecimens,
and slides from them. These consist of rhyolites aud obsidians,
with rhyolitic and pumiceous breccias and tuffs, geyserites, and
sinters. The rocks exhibit spherulitic and perlitic toxtures,
fluxion, devitrification, and impregnation with silica. In one case
the obsidian,, after solidification, appears to have undergone tho
following changes: —(1) devitrification, with formation of spheru-
lites ; (2) increase in temperature sufficient to destroy the double
refraction of spherulitcs and the earlier-formed felspars ; (3) the
decomposition of parts of the spherulites, causing them to assume
the characters of a coarse-grained felsite. The rocks from Rotorua

 268                       Geological Society.
 exhibit the effect of solfataric action resulting in the production of
 a high percentage of silica in the rock, and the development of hyalite
 and isotropic opal-silica or geyserite. In some cases these rocks have
 had silica substituted for portions of the spherulites which have been
 dissolved, the fibrous structure being preserved in opal-silica, which,
 nevertheless, exhibits double refraction.
    In conclusion, the author suggests a comparison of certain ancient
 rhyolites of Great Britain with those of New Zealand affected by
solfataric action. As to the causes which may convert a glassy into
 a lithoidal rhyolite we still seem to lack information : it is possible
 that the action of steam may be instrumental in effecting such a
change, but this is probably only an occasional agent, and the more
general cause of such chauges must be sought elsewhere.
    2. * On the Discovery and Occurrence of Minerals containing
Bare Elements.' By Baron A. E. Nordenskiold, F.M.G.S.
   The first mineral referred to is scheelite, and the next cerite, which
contains no less than four rare metals. The incandescent light
produced when the latter mineral is fused with charcoal-powder was
first observed by Cronstedt in 1751. The discovery of glucina,
lithia, selenium, and yttria is next referred to. Minerals containing
yttria and oxides related to it were, at one time, thought to be almost
limited to certain pegmatite-veins running in a broad zone on both
sides of the 60th parallel of latitude. Latterly, fluocerite, orthite,
and gadolinite have been found in Dalecarlia ; and among these
minerals Benedicks discovered a silicate of yttrium containing
 I'5 per cent, of nitrogen and helium. The author discovered kaino-
site, a silico-carbonate of yttrium and calcium, among minerals
from Hittero; and the same mineral was subsequently discovered in
the tlucan, fissures, and drusy cavities at the Nordmarken mines. The-
last-mentioned discovery and others related to it appear to suggest
 that the mode of formation of fissure-minerals is not so unlike that of
 the pegmatite-veins of the Primary rocks as is generally supposed.
   Thorium, discovered by Berzelius in 1829, was originally obtained
from the rich mineral-locality of Langesund (called Brevig in
mineralogical literature), but it has since been recorded from other
localities, including Arendal and Finnish Lapland.             It is now
obtained from the monazite-sand of rivers in the Brazils and South
Carolina. Thorite contains about -5 per cent, of inactive gas,
probably a mixture of nitrogen and helium ; but the latter element
was first obtained from the mineral cleveite, also containing thorium,
discovered by the author in 1877. Other minerals bearing nitrogen,
argon, or helium are referred to ; and under the head of minerals
bearing tantalum, mention is made of Giesecke's discoveries in Green
land. Among these is fergusonite, one of the richest sources hitherto
known for obtaining that mysterious gas, or mixture of gases, which
on our planet seems to be almost exclusively confined to minerals
containing rare earths. ' The group of earths, as well as the group
of gases, of which we are here speaking, might, therefore, be com
pared with certain genera among organic beings, whose species,
having not yet fully differentiated, offer to the descriptive zoologist
or botanist difficulties analogous to those with which chemists meet
in endeavouring to separate the rare earths and rare gases.'

     XXIV. Considerations regarding the Theory of Electrons.
    By Prof. W. McF. Orr, Royal College of Science, Dublin *.
   1. AlTHILE the theory of electrons developed within the
        TT      last few years by Larmor goes far to elucidate the
  nature of electricity, to place the electromagnetic theory of
  light on a dynamical basis, to extend the region in which
  electric and optical phenomena may be considered as mani
  festations of the energy of one and the same medium into
  the domain of electrostatics, and to resolve difficulties in the
  explanation of the observed influences of matter on aether
 on the electric and magnetic as well as the optical side, the
 acceptance of one of its postulates as to the nature of
 electrons is not free from difficulty.
     2. An electron or point-charge of strength e is defined t as
 a freely mobile singular point in the specification of the
 sethereal (rotational) strain such that very near it the strain
 assumes the form — ( -=- , .- , -y ) - . The nature of the
                        iir\d,c dy dz ) r
 nucleus is not precisely specifiod ; but it appears in keeping
 with the theory, and indeed suggested by its first develop
 ment, to suppose that it may possibly be an exceedingly
minute spherical portion of the sether devoid of rotational
elasticity. If any number of such inelastic portions of any
size and form exist, and be supposed fixed, the equations of

equilibrium of the (ether* lead to the conditions that the
vector representing the rotational strain should at the surfaces
of the nuclei be normal, and outside them be the gradient of
a function oE the coordinates. This strain-vector can further
be chosen so as to satisfy the conditions that outside the
inelastic regions its concentration shall be zero, and that the
surface-integral of the normal rotation over each such region
shall have any assigned value. A state in which the rotation
of the aether is identical with what the equilibrium electric
displacement of Maxwell would be in case the inelastic regions
were replaced by charged conductors, or if of exceedingly
minute dimensions by point charges, is thus a possible
(though not by any means the only possible) t state of
equilibrium of the aether ; and the explanation of electro
static phenomena is so far satisfactory.
    3. But in the development of the theory of moving electric
charges, what is called the motion of an electron is the shifting
of the centre of the strain from one point in the ajther to
another, the strain being altered, by continuous motion of
the aether, except for portions lying in the track of the
nucleus, from what it would be with the nucleus in one
position to that which it would be with the nucleus in the
other. What is contemplated is not a motion similar to that of
a solid body, or a bubble of air, or a vacuous region, through
a material fluid, or similar to that of a strain-nucleus through
a material solid ; not a displacement of the inelastic portion
of the aether, but a transference of the inelastic property
from one portion of the nether to another, or the annihilation
of the electron in one position and its creation in another,
and necessarily involves a constructive process of some kind.
An analogy is, however, drawn between such an election in
the aether and a stniin-nucleus in a material medium : in the
original development of the theory this was pushed too far ;
it was stated that each is freely mobile J ; in the latest state
ment it is, however, pointed out that a strain-nucleus in
ordinary matter does not possess mobility of the kind postu
lated for an electron §.
   * See Phil. Trans. A. 1894, p. 747, where, however, it is really only
the varying part of the rotational strain-vector (/, g, h) that is expressed
as the curl of another vector, for such a representation of the total strain
implies that the surface-integral over any closed surface of the total
normal rotation is zero ; or § 9, below.
   t The concentration of the strain-vector might have arbitrarily assigned
values throughout the elastic regions, corresponding to a volume-dis
tribution of electricity throughout the free aether. It might indeed be
urged against the theory that it does not explain why such a distribution,
never occurs.

     4. And a mobility of this nature, even if it be not
 necessary in order to surmount difficulties in the theory of
 aberration of light, is absolutely required for the existence
of a force between two electrons or other conductors. In
the development of the theory, electric force appears in the
variation of the energy as the coefficient multiplying the
virtual displacement of the centre of the electron nucleus *,
and the mechanical traction on the surface of a material
conductor as the coefficient multiplying (he virtual displace
ment of a portion of the surface of the conductor. But this
variation of the energy is made on what amounts to tho
supposition that in the displacement of the surface of the
nucleus or conductor any region of aether which is thereby
encroached on loses its elasticity, and any region which
 is thereby vacated regains it. (The fact that this is probably
what occurs effectively in the case of a finite material
conductor, as the charge consists of a distribution of free
electrons over its surface which, when in equilibrium, keep
the interior free from electric stress, in no way vitiates tho
argument here presented. If this hypothesis be correct, the
consideration of what happens when a portion of the surface
of a material conductor is moved involves, and should be
f receded by, the discussion of the motion of an electron.)
  f, on the other band, the variation be made on the supposition
that there goes on no such process of electric straining on
one side and release on the other, but that the displace
ment of the surface involves the displacement of the sur
rounding aether in the same way as the displacement of a
portion of the surface of a bubble of air involves that of
the surrounding medium, then the corresponding coefficient
may be proved to be zero. Such a supposition would therefore
afford no room for electrostatic force between electrons or
conductors, any more than ordinary hydrostatic theory shows
an attraction or repulsion between two balls immersed in a
material fluid.
    And the difficulty could not be surmounted by supposing
that the nucleus is not devoid of elasticity, but is a region of
aether in which the concentration of the rotation-vector is not
zero, corresponding to a volume-density of electricity therein,
or that the nucleus is so small that the energy of the irro-
tational motion which wonld be caused by its displacement
if the surrounding sether did not resist rotation, is negligible;
or that the resistance of the a;ther to compression, though
enormously great, is not infinite. On any of these hypotheses,

when the aether has once assumed the equilibrium state
appropriate to given positions of the electrons or conductors,
the nuclei as well as the surrounding aether are in equilibrium,
and there is no tendency for anything to move unless the
continuity of the medium can be broken down in some way.
   5. It is held by Larmor that a model of the electric field
may be complete without exhibiting a direct mechanism b)-
which electrostatic attractions and repulsions are transmitted
across the aether from the surface of one conducting region
or electron to that of another*. As these attractions and
repulsions make their appearance as coefficients of the virtual
displacements of electrons, such displacements being made on
the supposition of " free mobility," it is, I think, evident that
the reason his theory does not show the transmission of these
forces through the aether is that it does not show any ma
chinery by which the mysterious " mobility " of the electrons
is provided and the constructive processes involved in their
motion are performed.
   6. Thus the illustration of the origin of the static mechan
ical attraction between positive and negative electrons given
in the latest exposition of the theory | appears inadequate for
the purpose. Here an ideal canal in the aether is imagined
as filled up by a flexible wire of infinite torsional rigidity,
and in continuous connexion with the surrounding aether ;
the rotational displacement of any cross-section C round its
axis by an impressed torque is transmitted all along the wire,
and thence to the surrounding aether, and two complementary
electrons are thus developed at its ends A and B, which
persist as long as the rotational displacement of C is maintained.
 The author then states that the tangential tractions which the
 surrounding aether exerts on the surface of the wire form
 a system of forces statically equivalent by the principle of
 virtual work to an attraction between its ends, and that the
 mechanical attraction between the electrons may in this
 manner be considered as transmitted by the wire. This
 cannot be the case, however ; the tangential tractions are
 proportional to the strains, and therefore so also is their
 resultant, if any, whereas the electrostatic force to be ex
 plained is proportional to the square of the strain ; any
 mechanical force on the electrons would in fact be reversed
 by reversing the torque imposed on the wire, that is by
 intercbanging the positions of the positive and negative
 electrons. This consideration, taken in conjunction with
 those of symmetry, shows in fact that if the wire be originally

                     the Theory of Electrons.                 273
straight the electrons are in equilibrium. Contrary to the
assumption implicitly made in thus appealing to the principle
of virtual work, such electron-models are not " freely mobile";
when the ends of the originally straight wire are moved from
A, B to A', W, by bending it after the electrons have been
formed, the resulting equilibrium-strain in the ajther is uot
precisely the same as that due to two real point-charges at A',B'.
In the former case, at every point P of the wire the com
ponents along the normal to its surface of the vectors which
represent the ajthereal strain and the rotational displacement
of the element of surface of the wire are the same ; in the
latter the strain-vector is the resultant of e/iir . A'P-2 along
A'P, and —ejiir . B'P-2 along B'P. The strains cannot then
in general be the same.
   The strain-distribution in each of the above eases, more
over, is different from that which would exist if the wire
were first bent into the new position, then connected to the
aether, and afterwards rotated by the imposed torque.
   The specification of this illustrative model can however, I
believe, be amended so as to permit the existence, and show
the transmission, of attraction between the electrons. The
following mode of doing so, though perhaps not very elegant,
would serve this purpose. Suppose the wire replaced by an
indefinitely long hollow tube, having only slight resistance to
torsion, and riding loose on a concentric fixed rigid shaft ;
let keyways parallel to the axis be cut on the inside of the
tube and on the shaft, in such j>ositions that in order to key
the tube and shaft together the former must be rotated
against the reacting torque of the aether ; and let the rigid
key, of finite length, which fits in these ways, terminate in
rounded or spherical ends. If the tube be now thus forcibly
rotated around its own axis, and keyed to the shaft, the
equilibrium-strain in the aether will, as the torsional resistance
of the unkeyed portion of the tube is only slight, be almost
identical with that due to two conjugate electrons coinciding
with the spheres. Also the portions of the key way on the
tube beyond the spheres will assume the form of spirals of
some kind very fiat near the spheres, and will therefore
touch the latter at some point or points so situated that the
resulting pressures will not be at right angles to the axis of
the shaft, but will have components urging the spheres
towards each other. And, further, these electrons are " freely
mobile " along the line joining them ; an alteration of the
length of the key merely alters the distance between the
electrons. An endlong thrust in the key at the same time
prevents this mobility coming into play, and resists the

274                  . Prof. W. McF. Or on
attraction between the electrons. We may finally suppose
the key made in two parts which can slide or telescope over
each other, and the mobility of the electrons in the direction
of the line joining them has free scope.
    At the same time these electron models are totally devoid of
mobility in any other direction, and exert no machauical
jbrce on any electrons but each other.
    Thus in this instance the same mechanism that provides for
 " free mobility " transmits tho mechanical force. The trans
 mission, nay the existence, of electrostatic fores and the
 existence of " free mobility " are, it seems evident, intimately
 connected, and are explained or unexplained together.
    7. " Free mobility ' of electrons is, as stated by the author
 of the theory, one of its fundamental postulates.          While
 willing to admit that from one point of view he is justified in
 endowing the aether and the electrons with any properties,
 limited in number and consistent, necessary for the explanation
 of observed phenomena, and to grant the possibility of such a
 mobility as a thing unexplained, I venture to think that it is a
 most mysterious property, immaterial, and, in that it possibly
 dem mils something else than aether to perform the constructive
 process which is required, almost superavthereal ; that it
 involves a far larger concession than does a rotationally
 elastic aether ; that no model illustrating the properties of the
 primordial medium can be complete as regards electrical
 phenomena, unless it explains the nature of the constitution
 of an electron, the origin of its "free mobility," and the
 transmission of mechanical attraction or repulsion ; and that
 in respect of this last the theory of electrons, in it* present
 stage of development, might be held to be little more satis
 factory than that of direct action at a distance.
    8. It is pointed out by Larmor * that if the range of mole
 cular action were comparable with the size of the element of
 mass that is sensible to our powers of observation, the potential-
 energy function of a strained material medium would involve
 second as well as first differential coefficients of the displace
 ments ; in which case disturbances would still be transmitted
 by the medium but not by the agency of simple elastic stress
 definable in terms of surface tractions alone. In such a case,
 our notions of force, and of elastic stress as well, would be
  different from and wider than what they are ; but the state
 of things as regards the theory of elasticity of such bodies
 would, I think, resemble the actual state in that we should
 still succeed in describing the phenomena of motion as well
  as of rest of the various parts of a material body as due to

the equilibrium or want of equilibrium of the forcives of
 which we should then have to take cognizance, instead of
finding, as in the theory of electrons, that the play of forcives,
in terms of which we describe the state of equilibrium of the
tether under the influence of fixed electrons or conductors, is
inadequate to account for what happens to the aether which
lies in the path of a moving electron.
   U. Some analysis, slightly modified from that given by
Larmor", bearing on the subject under discussion is here sub
joined. Suppose the medium compressible, iucompressibility
bjiiiv regarded as a limiting case, aud let the surface bound-
ing an electron-nucleus be considered as a surface in crossing
which there is discontinuity of elastic quality, compressive or
rotational, or both. As the mechanical forces whose genesis
is in question are proportional to the squares of the rotations,
it is requisite that the equations should be correct as far as
 terms of that order in those strains, though not necessarily in
the compressions. Let V denote the volume, and p the
density of an element of aether, which when free from strain
occupies volume V0 and is of density p0, and let the pressure
be A'^A, where A denotes the compression, i. e, (V0 — V)/V0
or (p—pa)/p; then the compressive potential energy is
 A?A?/2p0 per unit mass. It may plausibly be supposed that
compression of an element does not affect the rotational
potential energy, and accordingly the latter is represented by
£«*(/* + g* + /<*) per unit mass instead of by bp0a {J* +9* + * )
per unit volume, where (/, g, h) is the rotational strain. Let
£, i), £ be the components of the displacement of the element
of ajther which is at the point x, y, z at the time t from the
position it occupied at the time zero. The conditions of equi
librium are then to be derived from the variation of the
potential-energy function

 wherein the left-hand member is taken over any open surface
 which lies altogether in a homogeneous region, and the right-

 not intersect any surface of discontinuity but may completely
 enclose any number of such.

   From this result and the previous equation we deduce that
the pressure is constant through each separate homogeneous
region, which taken in conjunction with the surface condition
shows that it is constant everywhere.
   The equations satisfied by (/, g, h) now lead to
               «V(/, 9, *)= - Wdx, d/dy, d/dz)V,
where V is some function of position. But we cannot deduce
that ysV should be zero.
    The equilibrium conditions thus admit of far more general
solutions than the equations of equilibrium in an actual
dielectric. They are, however, satisfied by any solutions of
the latter. And they are satisfied without it being necessary
to apply any extraneous forces to the surfaces of discontinuity,
i. e. the surfaces of the electron-nuclei ; that is to say, the
assumptions made do not account for attractions or repulsions
 between electrons, on the present hypotheses which do not
include " free mobility."

 of the rotational potential-energy, we suppose it to be

    10. It should be stated that the above remarks are the out
 come of a discussion with Larnior, in which the views I at
 first expressed were shown by him to be in many respecls
 mistaken, and in others have been considerably modified. In
 particular, the above analysis was put forward in an erroneous
 form to explain the transmission of mechanical force without
 postulating " free mobility," by showing a supposed incompa
 tibility among the complete equations of equilibrium in the
 absence of extraneous forces on the electron-nuclei.
    [ July 23.—Mr. Larmor sends me the following rejoinder:—
    In the rotationally elastic model which your paper consi
 ders, the gradient of" the translators displacement (f, 17, f) is
 proportional to magnetic force ; but your argument, § 4 and
 § !•, tacitly takes it to be also continuous with the velocity of
 the matter : such a scheme cannot be wide enough, as in fact
 you say. 1 should thus reply to § 9 that virtual variation of
 the aether-strain and virtual displacement of the material system
are independent operations : you do not introduce the latter, so

278       Prof. J. J. Thomson on the Genesis of the Jons
you do not obtain ponderomotive forces, but onty rethereal
forces. (For the distinction between sethereal forces and
electric forces, cf. 'iEther and Hatter,' p. 97.) You will, in
reply, ask for a model of an electron which will enable you
to introduce the virtual displacements of the different elements
of the surface of its nucleus, on which you can locate the
action of the mechanical force. And you will in fact anti
cipate that it cannot be given : that all that one can definitely
picture is the displacement of the electron as an aggregate.
The electron has to be postulated as able to traverse the
medium like a shadow without displacing it. It seems to be
an undue limitation of possibilities when you assume that the
nucleus must have a definite surface to which mechanical
traction can be applied: u vortex-ring circulating round a
vacuous core, in fact a vortex atom, is a structure which forms,
or may be held to form, a case in point. This, as you say,
amounts to postulating " free mobility " without explaining
it : but the permanence and mobility of the strain-configu
ration as a whole, which really constitutes the electron, are,
I think, intelligible in the model except in the immediate
neighbourhood of the singular point at its centre, so that on pos
tulating mobility for the unknown core all else is explicable.
As regards the remark towards Ihe end of § 9, and in the
footnote to § 2, that the electrification might be spread conti
nuously through the medium instead of being concentrated in
electrons, that sort of generality of course destroys the physical
simplicity of the scheme, which makes an electron an isolated
structural singularity in an unmodified aether, and it is not
called for by any facts. I admit that the representation which
you discuss in § (i is, as it stands, so imperfect as to be mis
leading rather than helpful. In 'iEther and Matter' §37
should be deleted : see § 73.]
 XXV. The Genesis of the Ions in the Discharge of Electricity
      throuijh Gases. By J. J. Thomson, M.A., F.H.S.'
IN many cases of discharge through gases, the ions have not
      to be supplied by the action of the electric field itself,
but are produced by external agents such as Kontgen rays,
ludiation from uranium and other radio-active substances, the
action of ultra-violet light on metals, incandescent filaments,
ifcc. In addition, however, to such cases as these we have the
very important series of phenomena which includes the spark-
discharge and the ordinary discharge through vacuum-tubes,

in which there are no external sources available for the pro
duction of ions, so that these must in soma way or another
arise from the action of the field itself. There are many
difficulties in the way of supposing th:it single molecules are
torn asunder, by the electric force in the field pulling the
positive ion one way and the negative ion in the opposite
way. To mention only one of these difficulties, the electric force
necessary to produce discharge is almost vanishingly sm.dl
compared with the force due to an atomic charge acting at an
atomic distance. In my ' Recent Researches ' I suggested that
under the action of the electric field some of the molecules
formed long narrow aggregations, just as smoke and dust do
under similar circumstances : these aggregations, being bodies
of higher specific inductive capacity than their surroundings,
will act on tin lines of force like long and pointed conductors,
and will therefore produce a great concentration of the lines
of force on the ends of the aggregation, so that the maximum
electric force in the field will be enormously greater than the
average force, which is all we can measure. Since that was
written, many investigations have been made which have
proved that where electrified particles move through a gas
ions are produced under certain circumstances, at any rate if
the particle is negatively electrified. Thus Lenard showed
that his rays make a gas through which they pass a conductor
of electricity. Lenard rays are negatively electrified particles,
and on our theory the conductivity of the gas is due to the
production of ions. Agiiin, I showed (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1897)
that the passage of cathode rays through a gas ionized it.
Thus we have evidence that in some cases at any rate the
motion of the corpuscles through a gas can ionize it. The
view that the motion of the ions through a gas can ionize a
gas is supported by the observation of Stoletew (.Journal de
Physique, ix. p. 408) that under the same electric force the
current between two plates, one of which is illuminated by
ultra-violet light, increases with the distance between the
plates, the increase being most marked when the pressure is
low. This is what we should expect if the negative ions,
starting from the illuminated plate, produced in the passage
through the gas fresh ions. The view which I wish to bring
forward in this paper, is that the ionization in the ordinary
cases of discharge through gases is produced by the motion
through the gas of ions or corpuscles already present in the
gts. These ions or corpuscles under the action of the electric
field acquire velocity and kinetic energy ; and when this
velocity or energy reaches a definite value, which need not
be the same for the positive as the negative ion, these ions
or corpuscles are able, by their collision with the surrounding

280       Prof. J. J. Thomson on tlie Genesis of the Ions
molecules, to produce other ions and corpuscles. This disso
ciation may be directly due to the collision, or indirectly to
rays like Rontgen rays produced by the collision. Let us
take the case of a gas through which a few ions are dis
tributed : then, if the energy or velocity communicated by the
electric field to these ions exceeds a certain critical value,
each of the original ions will produce other ions, and these
new ions will give rise to fresh ions, so that the number of
ions and the conductivity of the gas will rapidly increase ; it will
go on increasing until the conductivity of the gas reaches such
a value that the strength of the electric field is reduced so
that the work done by it on an ion is equal to the critical
value; when this stage is reached eachion produces one and only
one successor, so that the number of ions remains constant,
and the gas, with the discharge passing through it, attains a
steady state.
   If the strength of the field had been so small that the work
done on an ion was not equal to the critical value, the number
of ions would not increase, and there would be no discharge
through the gas beyond the very slight leak due to the
ions originally present in the gas. Thus this view explains
why a field of finite strength is required to send the discharge
through a gas.
   The maximum kinetic energy given by the field to an ion
will be measured by the work done on the ion during its free
path, for after a collision the disturbance in the energy and
direction of motion is so great that the work has as it were
to be begun over again ; while if the direction of the motion
is reversed the field, if it increased the kinetic energy of the
ion before the collision, will diminish it afterwards. Thus if
X is the mean free path, the kinetic energy given by the field
 to the ion will be measured by FeX, where e is the charge on
the ion and F the electric force. The condition that discharge
should take place is that the maximum kinetic energy should
equal q, where q is a quantity depending on the nature of the
gas. Thus the condition for discharge is ¥e\ = q, so that F,
 the electric force required to produce discharge, varies in
 versely as the mean free path of the ions or corpuscles.
    Now \ is inversely proportional to the density of the gas,
so that on this theory the electric force required to produce
discharge should in the same gas be directly proportional to
the density of the gas, a result which is approximately true
over a wide range of pressures. Thus the theory we are
describing gives a very simple explanation of the fact that
it is easier to produce a discharge through a gas at a low
pressure than through one at a high.

           in the Discharge of Electricity throuyh Gases.        281
    The theory readily explains why it requires a greater
electric force to send a spark through a thin layer of gas than
through a thicker one, provided the thickness of the thin
layer is less than a certain value which is inversely pro
portional to the pressure. For in order that the ions should
produce dissociation, it is necessary that they should strike
against the molecules of the gas, or if the dissociation is due
to rays produced by the collision, that the layer should be
thick enough to absorb the radiation ; but as soon as the
thickness of the layer becomes comparable with the mean free
path of an ion, the chance of their striking against a molecule
before reaching the electrode begins rapidly to diminish: so
that the ability of the moving ions to produce dissociation
will rapidly diminish when the thickness of the layer falls
below a certain value. And although the thickness of the
layer when the electric force begins to increase is large com
pared with the free path of a molecule moving through the
gas, it is not so compared with the free path ot a corpuscle;
i. «., one of the small ions which are found in the cathode rays,
and which we have reason to believe play an important part
in all cases of electric discharge.
    On this view of the electric discharge, the presence of a
small number of ions is required to start the discharge. The
experiments of Linss *, and the recent ones of Elster and
Geitel t, seem to show that such ions are present in gases
under ordinarj' conditions ; the first spark, too, is much more
irregular in its behaviour than subsequent ones, and this is
in accordance with the view that the conditions attending its
formation are capricious and almost accidental.
    Let us now consider the more complicated phenomena
attending the passage of the discharge through a gas at low
pressure. The production of ions may take place through
out ihe tube, or it may be localized in certain places. There
must, however, be at least two places where ionization takes
place. For on this theory the ionization at a place A is
produced by ions brought into A by the electric field, so that
there must be some other centre or centres of ionization to
produce the ions which are brought into A by the electric field.
 In the 'Philosophical Magazine' for March 1899 I showed
how, from the study of the distribution of electric force in a
discharge-tube, we could determine the places of maximum
ionization; the result of such an investigation leads to the

conclusion that there is one centre of ionization close to the
cathode, and another in the negative glow.
    According to the view taken in this paper, these centres
form mutually dependent and, as it were, regenerative sys
tems,—the ionization in the negative glow being due to the
corpuscles coming from the centre close to the cathode,
while the ionization close to the cathode is due to the positive
ions which come from the centre in the negative glow. This
view seems in accordance with the experiments of Villard *,
in which a screen placed between the negative glow and the
cathode stopped the emission of cathode-rays from the portion
of the cathode shielded by the screen.
    The negative corpuscles starting from the cathode ionize
the gas in the neighbourhood of the magnetic glow, producing
in this region a large number of ions ; this makes the region
one of great electrical conductivity, and the electric force,
consequently falls to a very small value. Let us now trace
what would happen if there were no centre of ionization
between the negative glow and the anode : the current in this
part of the tube would be carried by the negative ions pro
duced in the negative glow, such a distribution of ions in the
tube would cause the electric force to increase as we approach
the anode, and, if this increase did not cause the kinetic
energy of the ions to exceed the value at which they begin to
 produce other ions, the electric force would increase uninter
 ruptedly up to the anode. If, however, the electric force
increases to such an extent that the energy the field commu
 nicates to the ions is greater than that required for the disso
ciation of the surrounding molecules into other ions, then in
the region where the electric force reaches this value fresh
ions will be produced. This will increase the conductivity of
the gas, and therefore cause the electric force to diminish :
thus, after reaching a certain value, the electric force will fall
oft', and then begin to increase again after it has sunk below
the value at which ionization takes place. If this were repeated
 several times before the anode was reached, we should get the
 electric force waxing and waning, as it does in the striated
 discharge. The ^ iew that the striations consist of alternations
 of layers of high conductivity due to the ionization of the gas
 by an electric force exceeding a certain critical value, with
 layers of gas through which the electric force is too low to
 produce ionization, accounts for the distance between the
 striations diminishing as the density of the gas increases, and
 also for the distance between the striations in a tube of
 unequal bore being less in the narrow than in the broad jwirts

of the tube. The electric force in the striated part of the
discbarge is much less than that close to the cathode ; and it
might be urged that if such an intense field were required to
ionize the gas close to the cathode, the smaller field in the
striated discharge would not produce ionization. It must,
however, be remembered that, the ionization at the cathode
has to be produced by positive ions, while that in the rest of the-
field may be due to negative corpuscles ; and it may very we'll
be the case that the large positive ions are less efficient as
ionizers than the negative corpuscles.

IN the Journal of the Institution of Electrical Engineers

 Lodge of his researches in Magnetic Space Telegraphy.
The present writer then set up some apparatus to show these
methods in a popular lecture. Considerable difficulties soon
presented themselves, but success was ultimately attained.
Those who are conversant with the abovo paper will admit
that the theory involved in it is of importance, and that any
 new demonstration of it would be valuable.

 method, of special details introduced by the author, and of
 precautions to be adopted.

mutually in opposition to make a judicious compromise.

        core is used, and eddy-currents in neighbouring
        circuits.

                               Fig. 1.
passes through the key, fork, platinum-contact (P.O.), rheo
stat, and to the lower end of the cells ; the fork is worked by
the passage of this current through the electromagnet between
the prongs of the fork.
    But there is another branch to the circuit, beginning at the
mercury-contact (M.C.), then through the coils Ci and C2, the
adjustable condenser S being put as a shunt to the two coils,
then to the lower end of the cells.
    Thus if S were removed we should obtain current-alter
 nations in the coils of the frequency (100) of the fork; but
 with S in place, we have a frequency depending on the values
 of L and S in the coils. In setting up the system we select
 suitable coils and condenser, calculating the values of L
 from the dimensions of the coils; then put in such a value of

286                  Mr. P. E. Shaw on some
S as will give the required frequency, and finally adjust to
a maximum by the iron core in 02 (see expression I.).
   This frequency (400 was used) must be an exact multiple
of that of the fork (100), then between each charge received
by S from the fork, there would be four complete surgings
between S, Gu C!3 ; the potential changes would be con
siderable, and violent shocks might be obtained.
   L may be varied by the introduction of any number of
coils at C2, or by moving a core of iron wires in Cs. This
latter is a convenient adjustment, but wasteful on account of
hysteresis. The adjustments are (I) the mercury-contact
 (M.C.), (2) the rheostat, (3) adjustable L in C,. Place
one ear on the flat condenser (taking care to avoid getting a
shock from its terminals), listen to the note heard in it, and
change (1), (2), and (3) up to maximum loudness. The
adjustment (1) must on no account be neglected ; the method
adopted was to have the fork rigidly held, but capable of
being rotated by any small amount in a vertical plane.
   Thus, as above described, we have a circuit with a given
frequency, whose note can be raised to a maximum intensity.
    Now turn to the secondary (or receiving) circuit (fig. 2).

The coil C3 is placed parallel to Gu and catches the waves from
it ; (J4 is an auxiliary coil. The condenser S is in series in
 the circuit, and not, as in the primary, shunted across the
 ends of the coils. There are two other coils in the same
 circuit:—(1) Mj is the coil of the relay, with its microphone-
 carbons shown above it ; (2) the small resistance-winding of
 a telephone induction-coil, the large resistance-winding
 being in series with the telephone T.
    If now the coil C3 is taking up the waves from the sending-
 circuit, and the variables C4 and S are set for exact tuning
 (to frequency 400) a note of maximum loudness will be heard
 in the telephone T. In the primary it is convenient, though
 wasteful, to have an iron core in a coil for the small adjustment
 of L, but in the secondary it would be useless, since fi is small
 for the very weak currents existing.

           Lecture Experiments illustrating Syntony.         287
   Now put in the first relay by adjusting the carbons at Mx.
The action occurring at Mj and M2 must be explained in
detail. The coil Mj lies in a horizontal annular space in which
the lines of force run radially, and normal to the wires in the
coil ; then if current-alternations occur in the coil, it is im
pelled up and down with the frequency of the alternations ; the
field meanwhile is maintained constant by a separate strong
current (say 10 amps.). The movements of the coil will, by
the action of the microphone, produce alternating currents of
a higher order of intensity in the relay-coil M3 ; and this,
in turn, will in like manner give strong currents in the last
circuit, producing a loud note in the loud-speaking receiver
(L.S.R.). Although, to avoid confusion in the diagram, no
such connexions are shown, it is easy to put the induction-coil
and telephone (I.C. and T.) into the second circuit, and by
them adjust the working of Mj to a maximum intensity.
   The relays should be guarded from all vibrations by being
put on blocks resting on soft rubber balls ; also they should
be on separate blocks, otherwise the action of one will start
the other.
                    Description of the Relay.
   The principle involved is due to Prof. Lodge, and is found
in his magnifying-telephone ; but the attachments of the coil
and the system suspending it are due to the author, and will
be shortly described.
                                Fig. 3.
   The wires WW (fig. 3) carry the strong current (say
10 amps.) used to produce a field ; the magnetic circuit of

 288                Mr. P. E. Shaw on some
 soft iron is seen to be ABC DA ; it has the air-gap between
 D and A in which the coil n n lies. This is the coil Mt or M,
 in fig. 2.
    The coil n n is very light, 60 turns of covered copper wire
 (36 s.w.G.), resistance about 4 ohms, wound on a paper pill-box,
 which is light and rigid and perfectly circular, and is hence a
 very convenient former for the coil. The steel wire s s has a
 light brass fitting screwed tightly to its centre ; below this is
 a light bow of cedar lashed and cemented to the brass above
 and lashed and cemented to the coil below.
    As seen in the sketch, the wire is fixed (bent on itself and
 brazed) to a brass screw at each end, each provided with two
nuts, on the outside of the stout brass frame b b.
    By tightening the wire we can produce in it the required fre
 quency, 400 (this can be observed by gently tapping the wire
 and listening for its natural frequency) ; then alternations in
 the current of n n must produce vibration in the wire s s, and
 when the carbons are set by the screw z we have the micro-
 phono acting.
    Two graphite buttons, or one graphite and one hard carbon
button, were found to act very well.
    Another form of relay was used. Take a Blake transmitter,
change the stiff iron plate for a more yielding one, and attach
 the coil nn to it. This acts fairly, but is obviously not
syntonic with the whole system as in the other case.
                            Manipulation.
    The chief special difficulties may be mentioned categorically.
    I. It must be borne in mind that in such an apparatus as
that used, where the ratio j- is comparatively large, damping
occurs rapidly, and consequently the current-amplitude dies
out rapidly between each fresh charge received from the fork.
                                 Fig. 4.
We supposed the fork to have frequency 100, and the circuit
to have frequency 400. Then the curve for current would
be of the nature shown in I.; whereas the ideal curve, where
R
y is negligible, would be as in II., where the amplitude is

            Lecture Experiments illustrating Syntony.         289
 seen to remain constant. Consequently in our system we
 should have a pronounced fundamental 100 as well as an
 harmonic 400, and we have to learn to pick out the latter and,
 in adjusting the circuit, to work it up to a maximum. This
 applies to both primary and secondary circuits.
    II. Care must be taken to properly adjust the platinum
 and mercury contacts, not only to produce the maximum true
 sound in the circuit, but also to avoid any spurting at the
 contact ; this would have its counterpart in violent spurts in
 the sounds in the coils, which mask the true effect.
    III. The greatest difficulty experienced, however, was in
 the microphones, both (1) in obtaining them truly syntonic
 with the circuit and with one another, and (2) in the minute
 adjustment of the carbons for very weak currents. The
 special relay described above worked well, but requires
 delicate handling in respect of both (1) and (2). Anyone who
 has worked a granular transmitter, or indeed any microphone
 with a view to obtaining maximum effects for very small
 movements, will admit that an exceedingly fine adjustment is
 required. This might seem to be self-evident, but the author
 has made independent research on this point, his results being
 that a movement of one carbon of the order 10~s cm. would
 carry the microphone from hard contact (no microphone
 action) to complete freedom. Hence the difficulty above
 stated is quite intelligible.
    In working the relay described previously, the final ad
justment was made by gently pressing with the finger on the
 stout brass bar hb (the section of the bar is £ in. x i in.).
 This of itself indicates the delicacy of the microphone.
    IV. The design of the sending and receiving coils.
The author had in each of them 100 turns of insulated copper
 wire (16 s.w.G.), radius about half a metre, resistance about
3 ohms.      If the same wire had been opened out to 50 turns of
radius one metre in both sender and receiver, the mutual
induction would be four times as great ; the self-induction of
each would be slightly reduced (roughly to about two-thirds
of its former value), but this could be made up in the auxil
iary coils. Thus it is advantageous to have the radius of the
coils large. In making the auxiliary coils we require to
have large L with small R. If we have a given amount of
wire at our disposal, it is better to have small radius and many
turns, and have a core of iron wires for final adjustment.
One advantage of keeping It moderately large in the circuit
is that we run no risk of breaking down the condenser in the
primary.
   V. In Prof. Lodge's research the sound produced at the

$90       Some Lecture Experiments illustrating Syntony.
receiving-telephone was very small, just sufficient for audi
bility being all that is required by a single observer ; but in
the case here discussed, we have to produce sounds to be
given out to a large audience by a loud-speaking telephone ;
these would have to be, and were, thousands of times as great
as required in the former case. The process of amplifying
 the small currents until they become large and produce
 really loud signals is a difficult one in itself; but an even
 greater one arises from the passage of large currents through
 the last microphone ; the carbon-contacts are rapidly burnt
 away, and as a microphone contact is a very delicate one,
 continual adjustment is required.
     To meet this special difficulty Prof. Lodge has employed
 an ingenious device which should be mentioned. The upper
  carbon is attached to a large mass which turns freely on a
  horizontal axis, which is so counterpoised that the two
  carbons are gently but steadily pressed together. If the
  carbons burn away at. the contact, the pi voted system moves
  on its axis and maintains the same microphone-action as
  before. Thus the contact is kept automatically in working
  order.
     It should be pointed out that though the sounds produced
  in the receiver were much louder than in the case of Prof.
  Lodge's system, yet the distance between sender and receiver
  was in his case very much larger; so that each arrangement
  has its own difficulties.
                          Another Experiment.
     By a small modification in the primary circuit, timing can
  be demonstrated in a very striking way. In fig. 1 put a
  loud-speaking receiver in series with the coils (^ and Cs, and
  shunt it by a resistance-box. On working the circuit this
   receiver gives out a loud sound of the circuit-frequency ; by
   changes in the shunt we can affect its intensity, while by
   changes in L or 0 we alter its frequency. It may be men
   tioned in passing that this is a convenient means of producing
   a sound of constant intensity and is easily adjustable (though
   not necessarily pure), and as such it has been used by the
   author.
      As a simple example, if we change the capacity from 0-9 mfd.
   to 04 mfd., then the frequency should change in the ratio
   si   q = .7 ; the notes will be found to have about a musical
   interval of one-fifth.
      The author's best thanks are due to Prof. Lodge for advice
    during the progress of the work.

 XXVII. On the Laxo of Cailletet and Mathias and tlie Critical
    Density. By Sydney Young, D.Sc., F.R.S., University
    College, Bristol*.
 IN a very interesting paper (Mini, de la Soc. Boy. des Sci.
      de LiSge, se>. 3, ii. 1 81)9) M. E. Mathias discusses the
 law of the Rectilinear Diameter, discovered in 1886 by
 M. (Jailletet and himself, and the law of the corresponding
states of matter. The law of Cailletet and Mathias may be
stated simply in this way: —The means of the densities of
liquid and saturated vapour for any stable substance are a
rectilinear function of the temperature.
   It has been shown (Mathias, Ann. de la Fac. des Sci. de
 Toulouse, 1892 ; Young, Phil. Mag. Dec. 1892, p. 506) that
if the generalizations of van de Waals regarding corre
sponding temperatures, pressures, and volumes are correct,
the angular coefficient a [D,= D0 + a/, where Dt and D0 are
the means of the densities at t° and 0° respectively] of the
diameters of different substances should be directly propor
tional to their critical densities, and inversely proportional to
their absolute critical temperatures; or that for any substance
                                     D,
                                     T>'
thus -fv- = const. =o.
   M. Mathias points out that in order to test the truth of the
law of corresponding states, it is only necessary to ascertain
whether a is really a constant. He then discusses the con
ditions necessary for the determination of a.
   For a certain number of substances the critical temperature
and the densities of liquid and saturated vapour from about
the ordinary boiling-point to the critical point have been
determined ; and in these cases there is no difficulty. From
the mean densities at a series of temperatures a is found, and
Dc is then calculated from the formula
                      D.= D0 + a(Tc-273).
   In the great majority of cases, however, the only density
determinations that have been made are those of the liquid
below the boiling-point. We may, however, calculate the
densities of saturated vapour at these low temperatures if the
vapour-pressures are known on the assumption that the
vapour-density is practically normal ; and thus the mean
densities of liquid and saturated vapour may be ascertained.

292        Dr. S. Young on the Law of Cailletet and
   Now the law of Cailletet and Mathias has been found to
hold good for a considerable number of substances from the
boiling-point to the critical point ; and M. Mathias', making
the very natural assumption that the law may be relied upon
at lower temperatures, calculates the value of a from the
mean densities below the boiling-point. If the critical tem
perature is known, the critical density is then calculated as
before; but for most substances the critical temperature has
not been directly determined ; and M. Mathias discusses the
methods, notably that of Thorpe and Riicker, that have been
suggested for calculating this constant.
    M. Mathias shows that if, in Thorpe and Riicker' s formula
                        „ _ TVi— Tjrfg
 A = 2, then it follows that a = l.
    He further shows how, if a—\, it would be possible to
 ascertain both the critical density and the critical temperature
 by a geometrical method. In most cases, however, A differs
 sensibly from 2 and a from unity, and the geometrical method
 is then inapplicable ; neither can the critical temperature be
 calculated with sufficient accuracy by employing the value of
 A, 1*095, adopted by Thorpe and Riicker.
    It occurred to me that A, though not quite the same for
 different substances, might possibly be related to the compo
 sition in some simple way; audi have therefore calculated its
 value (taking 0° and the boiling-point under normal pressure
 as the two temperatures) for the thirty compounds referred to
 in this paper ; these constants are given in Table I. Unfor
 tunately there does not seem to be a sufficiently marked con
 nexion between the values of A and the composition to be of
  much practical use.
    M. Mathias arrives at the conclusion—which, I think (except
 for a few special cases), is quite justified— that it is necessary
 to make a direct determination of the critical temperature.
    M. Mathias then proceeds to the examination of experi
 mental data derived from various sources. The critical tem
 perature, the vapour-pressures, and the densities of liquid
 chlorine have been very carefully determined by Knietsch ;
 and M. Mathias has calculated the densities of the saturated
 vapour below the boiling-point ( — #3°-6), and finds that the
 constancy of both a and \)c are apparently extremely satis
 factory; but the value of a ("7675) is very far from unity.
 The value of Dc is '5782; but it may be pointed out that the
 ratio of this to the theoretical density at the critical tempe

                 Mitt/iias and the Critical Density.         293
rature and pressure as observed by Knietsch is only 3'03, a
very low number.
    Among the other substances examined by M. Mathias is
normal decane, for which the densities of liquid have been
determined only at low temperatures. In this case the values
of at, a, and Dc seem to be at variance with those obtained by
myself for the lower normal paraffins, as will be seen from
the table below :
       Pentane              -000460         0-931      -2324
       Hexane              -00044(5        0'967       '2343
       Heptane             -000440          1-013      '2344
       Octane              -000440          1-075      -2330
       Decane               -000380         0-928      -2471
    For the four lower paraffins a and D„ show very slight
variations, whilst a rises considerably with increase of mole
cular weight, so that the values calculated for decane appear
improbable.
    In view of these apparently abnormal results it seemed
advisable to undertake a careful examination of the whole of
the data which I have obtained for thirty substances. In all
 cases except the alcohols the critical densities were calculated
 by the method of (,'ailletet and Mathias, the mean densities
 above the boiling-points only having been used except for one
 or two substances; and though the deviations from the formula
 Dt = D0 +¦ at differ somewhat considerably, there did not appear
 to be any definite tendency to curvature except possibly in a
 few cases. I have, indeed, attributed these deviations to
 errors of experiment ; and this view was strengthened by the
 fact that for normal pentane, with which very careful deter
 minations were made from 0° to within 0o,05 of the critical
 temperature, the deviations were exceedingly small and well
  within the limits of experimental error.
    As will be seen later, however, it turns out that in choosing
 normal pentane for this special investigation I happen to have
 hit on the one substance which does not show the slightest
 deviation from the law of Cailletet and Mathias.
     Since the publication of M. Mathias's paper I have calcu
 lated the mean densities of all thirty substances at intervals
 of ten degrees between 0° and the boiling-point ; and it
 became evident that for many of them the deviations increased
 rapidly below the boiling-point. Moreover, on plotting all
  the differences between the mean densities and those calcu
 lated from the formula D<=D0 + «t< against the temperature,
 distinct curvature was noticeable in many cases. This will be

a being negative in these and all other cases (for both formulae),
whilst £ is positive in the first two cases but negative in the
last two.
    For normal pentane it will be seen that there is absolutely
no indication of curvature, so that /8 = 0; for the alcohols, on
the other hand, the curvature (in the same direction as that
for propyl acetate) is so pronounced that a fourth term, <yt3,
has to be introduced into the formula to reproduce the data.
    The values of a and of . ^ [ the ratio of the actual to the
 theoretical density at the critical point] are given for the five
 substances; those for methyl alcohol are very high, 1*142 and
 4"521 respectively.
     It is remarkable that as the curvature changes in such a
 manner that £ passes from a positive value, through zero, to
 a negative value, a and y£ regularly increase.        It is espe-
 cially remarkable that for normal pentane, for which 0=0, the
 value of jy (3"765) is almost exactly that which may be
  taken as normal for substances whose molecules undergo no
  dissociation or polymerization. (The ratio given by van der
             8
  Waals is ^ =2*6, but, as shown by Guye and by Heilborn, if
  we accept 0. B. Meyer's correction for the relation between
  b in the formula of van der Waals and the space actually
  occupied by the molecules, this number should be multiplied
  by V"2, which would give 3* 7 7.)
      That being so, we may perhaps bike the normal value of a
   to be about 0-f3.
      It seems unnecessary to give the differences of the ob
   served mean densities from those calculated from the formula
   D( = D0 + at at intervals of ten degrees for each of the thirty
   substances, but in Table 1. I have given the values of D0,

   served and calculated mean density at 0°, and lastly A

   and it will be noticed that there is, on the whole, a distinct
   tendency for a to rise ; thus the values of a on the one side
   of normal pentane are, with one exception (stannic chloride),
   lower than "931, and those on the other side are, again with
   one exception (fluorbenzene), higher.

   Again, all the differences at 0° on the one side of normal
pentane are negative, and with one exception (fluorbenzene)
all on the other side are positive.
   That there is a relationship of the values of a to the ratios

    With regard to the differences at 0°, M. Mathias notices
 (loc. cit. p. 19) that at low temperatures the substituted
 ammonias give values of a that increase as the temperature
 falls, but he regards this as being due to the approach to the
 solidifying-point.
    It appeared to me more probable, however, that in most
 cases the mean densities would be more accurately repre
 sented by the equation
                         Dt=D0 + cd + l3t*
 than by the simpler one D, = D„ + at, and I therefore cal
 culated the constants D0, «, and ft for all the substances.
 For the alcohols, however, it was necessary to introduce a
 fourth term, yts, to get a satisfactory agreement.
     I am indebted to Miss E. U. Fortey, B.Sc, for much
  valuable assistance with these calculations.
    The constants are given in Table II., and here it will be
 seen that whilst the values of a are without exception negative,
 those of yS on the one side of normal pentane are all positive,
 and, with three exceptions, those on the other side are
 negative. These exceptions are : fluorbenzene, which was
  before found to behave abnormally; hexane, for which /8 = 0;
 and methyl alcohol, for which y has a very high negative
 value.

   A comparison of the results by the two formulae is given in
Table III.     Under — are given the mean differences mul
tiplied by 104 between the observed and calculated densities
without regard to sign ; under — . the algebraical sum of the
differences multiplied by 104 and divided by the number of
observations.
   The numbers under I. refer to the formula with two con
stants, those under II. to the formula with three constants
(four for the alcohols).
   Taking the whole range of temperature for each substance
it will be seen that the agreement when the three constants
formula is used is very much better than when the simpler
one is employed. Excluding the alcohols and acetic acid, the
molecules of which are almost certainly of different complexity
in the gaseous and liquid states, the mean value of - for the
26 substances is 5"40 for the formula with two constants as
                                             A' .
against 1"51 for that with three. That - is very small in
each case for the formula with three constants, not only for
the whole range of temperature but also for the temperatures
above and below the boiling-point taken separately, may be
regarded as evidence that the curves represent the results
with satisfactory accuracy ; and, if that is so, the values of -
for the same formula may be taken as a measure of the
experimental errors which, it will be seen, differ considerably
for different substances. The large errors in the case of
stannic chloride may be explained by the fact that this com
pound attacks mercury at all temperatures whilst carbon
tetrachloride does so at high temperatures, so that special
experimental methods had to be devised. Again, the observa
tions with iodobenzene had to be made by artificial light as
the substance becomes rapidly coloured on exposure to day
light. Acetic acid gave a good deal of trouble at the highest
temperatures, owing to repeated bursting of the tubes, but the
comparatively large errors with ether and ethyl and propyl
alcohol are not easily accounted for.
   It remains to be seen whether the simpler formula D<=D0
 + at is sufficiently accurate to be employed for temperatures
between the boiling-point and the critical-point. The values
of — and — above the boiling-point are therefore given in

the table, and it will be seen that the improvement effected
by introducing the third constant is very much smaller than
for the whole range of temperature. Thus the mean value of
—falls only from 2*46 to 1"7J , as against 5*40 to 1*51 for the

whole temperature range, and for — the fall is only from
0*64 to 0*30 as against 3*43 to 0*14.
   There is therefore for this range of temperature, except in
the more extreme cases (near the top and bottom of the table),
not very much to choose between the two formula?.

two formulae below the boiling-point brings out the difference
between them in a most striking manner. For the formulae
with two constants the first eight values are negative, and the
rest with one exception (ether, for which the experimental
errors are large and the temperature range small) are positive,
and, omitting the alcohols, they range from —31*62 to + 22*36,
or, including the alcohols, to + 94*00. For the formula with
three constants the + and — signs are fairly evenly dis
tributed, and, excluding the alcohols and acetic acid, the
extreme values are —0*90 and +1*00. Again, for the
                                      A'
simpler formula, the mean value of — , excluding the alcohols
and acetic acid, is + 10*54, but for the formula with three
constants it is only +0*43. It is quite clear from this that
the constants for the formula D< = D0 + at calculated ex
clusively from the densities at temperatures below the boiling-
 point would in many cases differ very considerably from
 those calculated from the densities at temperatures above the
 boiling-point ; and that the differences between the calculated
critical densities {Uc=D0 + a(T<,— 273)} and also between the
values of a in the two cases might also be considerable.
    Thus for normal octane the numbers would be

   The constants calculated from the densities below the boiling-
 point approach fairly close to those obtained by M. Mathias
 for normal decane from the densities between 0° and 100°
 (p. 293) though, as might be expected from the higher mole
 cular weight of decane and from the fact that the densities

302          Dr. S. Young on the Law of Cailletet and
were not taken even to the boiling-point, the errors in that
case are still greater.
    There seems to be no doubt that, in order to find the critical
density with the greatest possible accuracy, it would be best
to make use of the whole of the available data and to employ
the formula with three constants, thus
                Do=D0 + a(T„- 273) + /3(T.-S!73)».
This has been done for the thirty substances, and the new and
old critical densities, also the new values of yj , are given in
 Table IV.
     For convenience of reference the critical temperatures and
 pressures, the specific gravities at 0°, and the boiling-points
 under normal pressure are also given in the table. The order
 is in ascending order of the recalculated values of ^ .
     It will be seen that the differences between the new and old
 critical densities are quite small. They are greatest for
 chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and iodobenzene; but the
 critical temperatures of these compounds are very high, and
 the density determinations have only been taken to 260° or
  270°. The greatest difference, that for iodobenzene, amounts
  to 0-55 per cent., and for this substance there is an extrapola
 tion through 180°.
     In the case of the alcohols the differences are not excessive
 because the old values were not obtained from the simple
  formula but graphically from curves drawn through the points
  representing the mean densities.
     Of th<> remaining 26 substances benzene shows the greatest
  difference, ()-26 per cent. ; in fourteen cases it is less than 0'1
  per cent.
     The alterations in the order of the substances in the tables
  ( depending on w? ) are few in number; di-isopropyl is
  brought next to isopentane ; the four halogen derivatives of
  benzene are brought together, whereas in the old table bromo
  benzene was separated from the others ; lastly, the new order
  of the alcohols is propyl, ethyl, methyl in place of ethyl,
  propyl, methyl.
      In both tables the iso- and di-isocompounds have lower
  values of j/t than the corresponding normal compounds.
      It is perhaps worth remarking that if, in the formula
        «T
  a= -~f, we take the value of a in the formula with three

304    Law of Cailletet and MatMas and the Critical Density.
constants instead of in that with two, and if we exclude the
alcohols and acetic acid, the variation in a is much smaller
than before, the extreme values being ^lb' and 1'039 as
against "882 and 1*090, and the change is especially marked
in the case of the hydrocarbons, for which the new constants
range from *91() to "968 as against "882 to 1*075. Now a in
the formula D< = D0 + at + /3<2 differs but little from what it
would be in the formula D(=D04a/ if we were to take only
the densities below the boiling-point, and as the variation of
a is smaller in this case, it is the more remarkable that this
constant should be so very low ("7675) for chlorine.
   In this respect chlorine resembles the alcohols (a = "717,
"746, and '844), but the critical densities of the alcohols are
abnormally high whilst that of chlorine appears to be very
low. It would be of considerable interest if the densities of
the saturated vapour of chlorine could be determined at high
temperatures so that the values of a, a, and Dc could be ascer
 tained with certainty, but the experimental difficulties would
be very great.
                      General Conclusions.
    1. The law of Cailletet and Mathias is very nearly, though
in most cases not absolutely, true ; it appears to be only
strictly true when the ratio of the actual to the theoretical
 density at the critical point ( rp ) has the normal value 3*77.
    2. The curvature of the " diameter " is generally smaller
 the nearer j^ approaches the normal value, and the nearer
 al =<*iy ) approaches the value 0*93.
    3. The curvature is in nearly every case in opposite
 directions according as -^s is greater or less than 3'77, and as
 a is greater or less than 0*93, and is such that in the formula
 D, = D0 + a< + /&-! /3 is positive when ~, is lower than 3*77
 and negative when it is higher, a being negative in every
 case.
    4. The curvature is generally so slight that the critical
 density may be calculated from the mean densities of liquid
 and saturated vapour at temperatures from about the boiling-
 point to within a few degrees of the critical point by means
 of the simpler formula D(=D0 + a« with an error rarely

    On the Duties of Ether for Electricity and Magnetism.    305
exceeding 0"25 per cent, and generally not exceeding 0"1 per
cent.
    5. If, however, the critical density be calculated from the
mean densities at low temperatures (say below the boiling-
point) only, the error may be considerable ; in the case of
normal decane it is probably between 5 and 6 per cent.
    6. As has been pointed out by M. Guye {Archives des
 Sciences Phys. et Nat. 1894, series 3, vol. xxxi.) the law does
not, as a rule, hold good at all for substances the molecules
of which differ in complexity in the gaseous and liquid states.

   Since this paper was written Mr. K. Tsuruta has kindly
sent me a copy of his ' Thermodynamic Notes,' No. 10 (Phys.
Rev. 1900, x. p. 116) in which he discusses the " law of straight
diameter " as applied to benzene. The conclusion he arrives
at is that whilst the mean densities obey the law " in quite a
satisfactory manner " not only from 80° to the critical-point,
but also from 80° down to the triple point, yet a more minute
 examination showed the so-called diameter " to consist of two
nearly straight parts meeting somewhere near the temperature
 180° ('., or, more strictly, to be a curve whose curvature is so
 slight that it can be so described."
   This conclusion is practically in agreement with that stated
in this paper.

§ 19. TN my paper published in the last number of the
          ±. Philosophical Magazine, of which this is a con
tinuation, I limited myself to a problem of mathematical
dynamics ; and merely suggested the possibility of finding
in it an explanation of the fundamental difficulty in the
Undulatory Theory of Light referred to in the first and
last paragraphs (§§ 1, 18). The following communication is
the substance of a supplementary statement relating to that
paper given orally to the (Jongres International de Physique
at a meeting held in Paris last Wednesday (August 8).
   § 20. 1 now cannot resist the temptation to speak of
efforts which occupy me to find proper assumptions for
including something of the allied subjects mentioned in the
foot-note on § 1.

306                 Lord Kelvin on tlie Duties of
    § 21. For atoms of electricity, which, following Lnrmor, I
at present call electrons, it inevitably occurs to suggest a
special class of atoms not fulfilling the condition stated in
lines 12-22 of § 5.
    Thus a positive electron * would be an atom which by
attraction condenses ether into the space occupied by its
volume ; and a negative electron would be an atom which,
by repulsion, rarefies the ether remaining in the space occupied
by its volume. The stress produced in the ether outside two
such atoms by the attractions or repulsions which they exert
on the ether within them, would cause apparent attraction
between a positive and a negative electron ; and apparent
repulsion between two electrons both positive or both
negative.
    § 22. But these apparent attractions and repulsions would
increase much more with diminished distance than according
to the Newtonian law of the inverse square. This law, which
we know from Coulomb and Cavendish to be true for electric
attractions and repulsions, cannot be explained by stress in
ether according to any known or hitherto imagined properties of
elastic matter. But a very simple hypothesis, assuming action
at distances, between different portions of ether, explains it
perfectly. Consider two portions of ether occupying infini
tesimal volumes V, V, at distance D asunder. My hypothesis
is that they repel mutually with a force equal to
                          (p-l)V.(p'-l)V
                                   jjs                              (lb);
where p, p' denote the densities of the two portions of ether
considered, and 1 is the natural density of undisturbed ether.
This makes the force repulsion or attraction according as
(p — 1), (p' — V) are of the same or of opposite signs; and
zero if either is zero, (which means that ether of undisturbed
natural density experiences neither attraction nor repulsion
from any other portion of ether far or near).
     § 23. This closely resembles Aepiuus' doctrine of the
 middle of the eighteenth century, commonly referred to as
 the " one-fluid theory of electricity " ; but now, instead of
 electric fluid, we have " ether," an elastic solid pervading all
 space. According to our present hypothesis, similar electric
 atoms repel one another, and dissimilar attract ; in virtue of
force between each atom and the portion of ether within it,
 and mutual repulsion or attraction of these portions of etber
    * It seems probable that this may be the resinous electrification, but
 it may possibly be the vitreous. It must be remembered that vitreous
 electrification has hitherto been called positive merely because it is it
 which is given by the " prime conductor " of the old ordinary electric
 machine.

   with no contributive action of the ether in the space around
   them and between them.
      § 2-4. Stress in ether, being thus freed from the impossible
   task of transmitting both electrostatic and magnetic force, is
   (we may well imagine) quite competent to perform the
   simpler duty of transmitting magnetic force alone.
     § 25. Hitherto one seemingly insuperable obstacle against
  following up this idea to practical realization has been the
  greatness of the force in many well known cases of magnetic
  attraction between iron poles, whether due to steel magnets
  or electromagnets. Considering that in our most delicate
  experiments in various branches of science, ponderable bodies
  large and small are observed to be moved freely by forces
  of less than a thousandth of the heaviness * of a milligram,
  how can we conceive the ether through which they move to
  be capable of the stress required for the transmission of force
  between flat poles of an electromagnet amounting per square
  centimetre to more than two hundred t times the heaviness
  of a kilogram ? This difficulty is annulled if we adopt the
  hypothesis which I have described to the Congres (§ 2 above).
  We may now suppose the density of ether as great as we
  please, subject only to the limitation that it must not be so
  great as to disturb sensibly the proportionality of effective
  inertia to gravity in different kinds of matter, proved by
  Newton in his pendulum experiment, for lead, brass, glass,
  &c., and by his interpretation of Kepler's third law for the
  different planets of our system. Probably we might safely,
  if we wished it, assume the density of ether to be as much as
 10~*. I am content at present, however, to suggest 10~9.
 This, with the velocity of light 300,000 kilometres per second,
 makes the rigidity (being density x square of velocity) equal
 to 9.1011 dynes per square centimetre, which is somewhat
 greater than the rigidity of steel (7.1011). It is clearly not
 for want of strength that we need question the competence of
 ether to transmit magnetic force I I confess that I now feel
 hopeful of seeing solved some of the other formidable diffi
 culties which meet every effort to explain electric insulation
 and conduction, and electromagnetic force, and the magnetic
 force of a steel magnet, by definite mechanical action of ether.
    * I cannot without ambiguity use the simple word "weight" here J
 because this word means legally a mass, ana is practically used more
 often to signify a mass than the gravitational heaviness of a mass.
    t The most intense magnetic field hitherto measured is, I believe, that
 of Dubois (see his Report on Magnetism to this Congress) in which he
 found 76,000 c.o.8. between two small plane end-faces of sou iron poles
of a powerful electromagnet. This makes the attraction per square
centimetre of either face (70,000)' -r-Sir, or approximately 28.10' dynes,
or 230 kilograms.

     XXIX. An Appendix to the Paper on the Classes of
    Progressive Long Waves. By R. F. Gwythkb, M.A.*
TO make a rigid test of the method of approximation which
        1 have proposed in my paper on " The Classes of Pro
gressive Long Waves " f, it appears to be desirable to pursue
the investigation to a higher order of approximation, espe
cially in the case of the Solitary Wave. For this purpose I
continue the expansions in the paper referred to, in which
               if ~ j) h*f" = ~ 3</'2 + 2(c2 ~9h¥'
 gave the first approximation.

 of the terms is to be estimated ; namely, that /' is of the
 order [cP—gfy/c3, and/"' of the order (c1—ghy/c*. I shall call,
 in order to avoid fractional orders, / ' of the order 2 of small
 quantities,/" of the order 3 $, and so on,
    Acting on this principle, the terms of (3) of the previous
 paper (the equations in this paper are numbered continuously
 with those of the former) can readily be arranged in sets of
 orders 4, 6, and 8. We thus obtain

cease to be the case to the eighth order. Having drawn these
conclusions I shall now omit from (13) the terms (in square
brackets) of the eighth order and proceed to the integration

we obtain an equation which would perhaps be most conve
niently treated by Weierstrass's notation, since the factors on
the right-hand side are far from obvious. We should be
entitled to put c*=ffh in the coefficients of the small terms in
order to make the expressions simpler. If c*=gh exactly, the
constant would have to be treated differently. As, however,
my present object is to examine the nature of the approxi
mation which has led to the differential equation, I shall
confine the further integration to the case where fi-0, which
leads to the case of the solitary wave. In the case of this
wave we are able not only to compare our results with the
analysis of earlier mathematical investigations, but also with
the records of Scott Russell's careful observations.

    From this the form of/ is easily found ; but the point of
most interest is the relation between m and the parameters
c and h given by (17).
    The method of comparison which I am now about to make
was very kindly suggested to me by Sir George Stokes, and
is based upon the article communicated by him to Professor
 Lamb, which appears on p. 421 of the latter's ' Hydro
dynamics.'                                 .    2 i
    In that article the formula c8 = J«/j -^—-—;
                                              -link   is shown byJ a
simple method to be the necessary relation between m and the
 parameters in the outskirts of a solitary wave. This result
 follows from assuming
                       <f> = Ae-2*(z-ct) cos 2„,y
 as the form of the velocity-potential when x is large.
     Sir George Stokes has now pointed out to me that this is
 an exact relation provided we admit (1) the possibility of
 the uniform propagation of the disturbance as a solitary wave,
 and (2) that in such a wave, at a great distance from the crest,
  the coefficient of disturbance varies in geometric progression
 as the distance from the crest increases in arithmetical
  progression.
     If then we admit that c =gh tan 2m/i/2mh is the exact
  formula for the wave, being found without assuming any
  relation between c and gh ; and if also the conditions of surface
  pressure can only be everywhere satisfied provided
  approximately, the approximate identity of the two formulae
  forms the condition for the existence of a Solitary Wave of a
  certain amplitude. And as under proper restrictions we
   know that such a wave is capable of propagation, the com
   parison of the relations under these circumstances is the
   proper test of the justness ol this mode of treatment.
      So long as mh is small, we can easily make the comparison
   by writing the exact formula in the expanded form
                      gh _.       4mV

   sions are then found to agree identically as far as these three
   terms in the expansion are concerned.

312          Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
   Proceeding to consider the larger values of mh, to which
this expansion for ^ becomes inapplicable ; Scott Russell's
observations led him to the conclusion that the height of the
solitary wave might be increased until it became about equal
to the depth of the undisturbed fluid ; and he gives c*=2gh
as the empirical formula for the velocity in this case. Making
a comparison of the formulae again with this value for c9, the
exact formula gives tan '2mh = imh, and
                   m/i = '583, approximately.
   The approximate formula in this case gives
                   mh = '577, approximately;
so that, even in this extreme case, the formulae are in very
close agreement, the difference in the values of mh being just
over 1 per cent.
   This comparison seems fully to justify the use of the method
I have employed to obtain the approximations.
   As the first approximation is that most likely to be em
ployed, it is perhaps worth while to record that the exact and
approximate expressions for the relation between m and the
parameters are identical for small values of mh if two terms
are taken in the expansion for gh/c1, and that the difference
in the terms of the next order is 2m*e*/5g*. Taking the
extreme case when c' = 2gh, the approximate value of mh falls
short of the exact value by about 7 per cent.
     XXX. The Chemical and Geological History of the
     Atmosphere. By John Stevenson, M.A., F.I.C.*
                I.— The History of Free Oxygen.
THE question as to whether any notable change has taken
       place in the chemical composition of the atmosphere
in the course of geological history is one that has received a
considerable amount of attention from chemists and geologists,
though probably not so much a* the importance and interest
of the subject deserve. It has been sufficiently clear to
geologists for many years that the carbon of our coal supplies
has been derived from carbonic acid formerly diffused through
the atmosphere or dissolved in the ocean ; and that if all this
carbonic acid existed at one time in the atmosphere, the
atmosphere must have been very much richer in carbonic

              Geolof/ical History of the Atmosphere.         313
acid then than it is now. Further, as the dissociation of
carbonic acid by vegetation not only has for its result the
fixation of carbon in the vegetable tissues, but also involves
the liberation of oxygen, it is obvious that the deposition of
the earth's supply of coal implies that a corresponding
quantity of oxygen has become permanently free, and there
fore the atmosphere must be to that extent richer in oxygen
than it was before the coal was deposited. But, on the other
hand, large quantities of oxygen are consumed and large
quantities of carbonic acid are produced by respiration and
combustion, and, also, very large quantities of carbonic acid
are observed to issue from the earth in volcanic districts ; so
it is not at all surprising to find that some chemists have been
of the opinion that the proportion of carbonic acid in the
atmosphere is increasing, and that the proportion of oxygen
is decreasing. In fact there has l>een, and probably there
still is, a very great divergence in the opinions held on this
question. And it is a question of the very greatest interest
and importance to chemical and geological science, for even
comparatively slight changes in the composition of the
atmosphere, especially as regards the amounts of oxygen and
carbonic acid present, would greatly affect the development
of animal and vegetable life ; while if such changes were at
all considerable they would exert a powerful influence on
many other phenomena, such as the weathering and denu
dation of rocKs, the solution and precipitation of carbonates
and hydrated oxides, and also the colouring of rocks and
soils by iron compounds, which are very sensitive to oxidizing
and reducing influences, and vary in colour accordingly.
   Further, the very existence of such a large quantity of
oxygen in the free condition as we find present in the atmo
sphere, notwithstanding its very strong affinities for other
elements, presents a sufficiently striking scientific problem.
No doubt a ready solution of it is sometimes found in the
great abundance of oxygen on the earth generally, but this
solution is by no means a satisfactory one. It would, no
doubt, be satisfactory and sufficient if the materials composing
the earth were all thoroughly oxidized. If that were the
case, then the free oxygen of the atmosphere would be simply
the extra or surplus oxygen that was left over after the
requirements of the other elements were satisfied. But,
unfortunately for this view, the earth, or at any rate the crust
 of the earth, is very far from being thoroughly oxidized.
 Not only do we find coal and other carbonaceous matter
 diffused throughout sedimentary rocks, but there are also
 found large quantities of sulphur, sulphide of .iron and other

 314         Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
 sulphides, and even in very primitive rocks the presence of
 oxidizable matter has been observed.
    Probably the first chemist who pointed out this circum
 stance clearly, and based a theory of the history of the
 atmosphere upon it, was Prof. C. J. Koeue, of Brussels, the
 contemporary and rival of Shis. In 1856, or thereabouts,
 he published a short series of popular lectures in which ho
 enunciated the theory that there was no oxygen in the earth's
 primeval atmosphere, his reason for adopting this view being
 that oxidizable matter is found in the earth's primitive rocks.
 He hold that the earth's primitive atmosphere consisted of
 nitrogen, carbonic acid, and aqueous vapour; and he also
considered that the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere
had gone on increasing during geological history, while the
proportion of carbonic acid and of nitrogen had gone on
decreasing. In holding such views he differed very notably
from previous and contemporary chemists, for example,
Dumas and Liebig, who considered that the proportions of
carbonic acid and of oxygon in the atmosphere were fixed and
constant ; and still more from Berzelius and Mulder, who
were of opinion that the proportion of carbonic acid was
increasing and the proportion of oxygen decreasing in the
atmosphere, owing to respiration, fermentation, volcanic action,
and human industry.
   These statements about Prof. Koene are derived from an
interesting series of articles which appeared in the ' Chemical
News' at intervals during 1893 and 1894 (vols. 67, 68,
69, 70), and were written by Dr. T. L. Phipson. F.C.S.,
 who had himself studied chemistry under Koene at Brussels.
In these articles he describes Koene's views on the history of
the atmosphere, and then proceeds to give certain modifi
cations and additions of his own. In particular, he thinks
that the constituents of the primitive atmosphere, may quite
well be reduced to the element of nitrogen alone, as he
considers that the carbonic acid present at any time on the
surface of the earth would be practically all dissolved in
water. He thinks that carbonic acid was produced regularly
and steadily throughout geological history by volcanic action,
but also (apparently) that there was never a very large
quantity of it existing on the earth in the free state at any
one time, as it was constantly being decomposed by vegetation
into free oxygen and the carbon of vegetable matters and of
(ultimately) coal.
   Dr. Phipson confirmed and amplified his views by a
number of beautiful and interesting experiments on the
growth of vegetation in various gases instead of ordinary air.

               Geological History of the Atmospliere.         315
The results obtained were very striking and important, both
as regards the way in which plants were found to thrive
under very unusual conditions, and also the very great
difference that was found to exist between different kinds of
vegetation as regards their rate of producing oxygen; that is
to say, the amount of oxygen produced by the same or
similar weights of different kinds of plants in the same time and
under similar conditions. As regards the experiments with
gases, a most remarkable result was obtained in the case of
hydrogen gas. The plant grew perfectly well, being of course
at the same time supplied with carbonic acid in aqueous
solution and with the elements of a fertile soil ; but in the
course of the experiment the hydrogen entirely disappeared.
Dr. Phipson considered that it must have combined with the
nascent oxygen produced by the decomposition of carbonic
acid by the vegetation under the influence of light. He also
infers from the same experiment that there was no free
hydrogen in the earth's primitive atmosphere ; but this in
ference is surely much more than is warranted by the facts
observed. It would no doubt be fair enough to infer that if
there was vegetation growing in very ancient times in an
atmosphere containing hydrogen gas, the oxygen liberated
from carbonic acid by the vegetation would not remain
permanently free so long as there was any free hydrogen left.
But vegetation may quite well have continued to grow in an
atmosphere containing hydrogen until all the hydrogen had
disappeared through combining with the oxygen produced
by the vegetation, and after that time the oxygen liberated
by vegetable growth would begin to have a chance of re
maining permanently free.
   The general interest taken in the question of the history of
free oxygen has increased considerably within the last two or
three years on account of the opinions expressed by Lord
Kelvin in 1897. In that year he discussed the subject on
two separate occasions, viz., in his address to the British
Association in Toronto on the Fuel Supply and the Air
Supply of the World, and in his address to the Victoria
Institute, London, on the Age of the Earth *. In the
former of these addresses (as briefly reported in ' Nature,'
vol. lvi. p. 461) he argued that as the earth was in all proba
bility originally hot and liquid, no primeval vegetable-fuel
existed ; further, no free oxygen existed at that period,
since it is not found in gases evolved from minerals or in the
spectra of stars. He considered, therefore, that the oxygen
of the air has probably resulted from the action of sunlight
                     * Pail. Mag. January 1899.

316          Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
on plants, and he found, by calculating the weight o£ fuel
corresponding to the total free oxygen of the atmosphere,
an upper limit to the amount of fuel in the world, viz.
340,000,000,000,000 (340 million million) tons.
   However, in his address to the Victoria Institute on the
Age of the Earth, his attitude on the oxygen question is
much less definite and decided. In § 40 of the printed
address he says that there is good reason for believing
that there was no free oxvgen in our primitive atmo
sphere, because the gases found in the cavities of granite and
basaltic rock contain nitrogen, carbonic acid, and water, but
no free oxygen. Further, some specimens of such rocks
or minerals even contain free hydrogen, and when they do
not contain free hydrogen they contain native iron or mag
netic oxide of iron. He considers, therefore, " that we may
judge that probably all the oxygen of the hot nebula which
became the earth fell into combination with hydrogen and
other metallic vapours on the cooling of that nebula ; and
though oxygen is known to be the most abundant chemical
element on the earth, none of it was left out of combination
to give free oxygen in our primitive atmosphere." His
position here is obviously the same as that taken up in his
Toronto address, but after discussing some other points
connected with his general subject (the Age of the Earth),
though not bearing directly on the free oxygen question, he
goes on to say : " It seems improbable that the average of
the whole earth—dry land and sea-bottom—contains at
present coal or wood or oil or fuel of any kind, originating
in vegetation to so great an extent as U'ltil of a ton per
square metre of surface ; which is the amount at the rate of
one ton of fuel to three tons of oxygen that would be required
to produce the 2*3 tons of oxygen per square metre of surface
which our present atmosphere contains. Hence it seems
probable that the earth's primitive atmosphere must have
contained free oxygen." He adduces no other reason for
this supposition than the above, viz., the difficulty in believing
that there is so great an amount of fuel or combustible matter
 due to vegetation existing on the earth.
   Probably most people will have the same difficulty in this
matter that Lord Kelvin has, but still there is ample room
to discuss the question further. The problem may be attacked
in several ways with a fair degree of confidence or hopeful
ness in the obtaining of a satisfactory answer, or at least we
may look at it from several standpoints, and thereby gain a
clearer conception of its nature and scope.
   The first and most obvious standpoint or line of inquiry

               Geological History of the Atmosphere.          317
 is that afforded by forming our estimate of the total coal-
 supply of the world, so far as this can be done from actual
 observation and measurement. Unfortunately the world has
  been so very imperfectly explored in this respect that the
 question as to the amount of the world's supply of coal is
 nearly (if not quite) as problematic as the question of the
 history of free oxygen. But still a good deal of information
 has been gained, and it is interesting to see in what direction
 it points.
    The best-explored region of the world is probably the
 United Kingdom itself, and the best-known estimate of its
 coal-supply is that given by the Report of the Royal Com
 mission on Coal, which sat from 1866 to 1871. in this
 report the " available coal," consisting of seams over one foot
 in thickness, and within 4000 feet of the surface, was esti
 mated at 146,000,000,000 (146 thousand million) tons, while
 the coal at greater depths than 4000 feet was estimated at
 48,000,000,000 (48 thousand million) tons. Since then
 Prof. Hull has given a much lower estimate of our coal-
 supply. He allows only 83,000,000,000 (83 thousand million)
tons or so ; but his reduction of the estimate seems to have
been obtained principally by raising the limit of the work
able thickness of coal-mines at considerable depths from one
foot to two feet, as he thinks that seams less than two feet in
thickness will not pay to work, even at depths considerably
less than 4000 feet. But this question about the thickness of
the seams does not at all affect our present inquiry. Even
the seams under one foot in thickness, and carbonaceous or
bituminous matters thinly distributed through shales, clays,
limestones, &c., are of quite as great importance for our
present purpose as the thickest and best deposits of workable
coal. So far as I am aware no estimate of this thinly dis
tributed carbonaceous matter has been published as yet, but
it may possibly be much greater in amount than the total
 coal-supply itself, especially if we understand by the term
 coal only the seams that are at least one foot thick, and
contain at least about 80 per cent, of combustible matter,
 that is to say, not more than 20 per cent, of ash. Let us
 suppose, however, that the total amount of this thinly dis
tributed carbonaceous matter is equal to only half of the total
quantity of coal over one foot in thickness. Let us also
suppose that the Royal Commission's estimate of the total
amount of coal at all depths in seams of one foot and up
wards in thickness is fairly correct, and let us call it in round
numbers 200,000, 000,000 (200 thousand million) tons, as it
comes pretty near that figure. This would make the coal in
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 50. No. 304. Sept. 1900.          Z

  318           Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
  seams less than one foot in thickness and other thinly dis
  tributed carbonaceous matter amount to 100,000,000,000
  (100 thousand million) tons. The total amount of coal and
  other mineral carbonaceous matter in the United Kingdom
  •would then be 300,000,000,000 (300 thousand million) tons.
  If we now suppose that the whole surface of the earth,
  whether dry land or covered by sea, contains on the average
  the same amount as the United Kingdom, then the total
  quantity on the earth will be 300,000,000,000x1630, or
  489,000,000,000,000 (489 million million) tons—an amount
  which is practically equivalent to the total free oxygen of the
  atmosphere.
      The total weight of the atmosphere is 5,200,000,000,000,000
  (5200 million million) tons, as may be readily calculated
  from the data that it is equal to the weight of a layer of
  mercury 30 inches deep, or the weight of a layer of water
  34 feet deep over the whole surface of the earth. And as
  23 per cent, by weight of the atmosphere consists of free
  oxygen, the total free oxygen weighs very nearly 1,200,000,
  000,000,000 (1200 million million) tons. The amount of
  pure carbon that would be required to convert this quantity
  of oxygen into carbonic acid is 450,000,000,000,000 (450
  million million) tons. Now if we suppose that the average
  amount of combustible matter in coal is equal to 90 per cent,
  of carbon (at least so far as its requirements of oxygen for
  combustion are concerned), then the amount of coal equi
  valent to the above figures would be 500,000,000,000,000
  (500 million million) tons ; a figure which is very similar to
  the estimate of the coal and other carbonaceous matter in the
  world which we have just made on the assumption that the
  amount present in the United Kingdom is something like the
  average for the whole world. It should also be noted that
  the above quantity is equal to a layer of coal 2£ feet thick
  and of 1*3 specific gravity over the entire surface of the globe,
  or a layer 5 feet thick over the whole " continental ' and
  " transitional " areas.
      Of course the objections will be at once made that the
   United Kingdom is probably very much richer in coal than
   the rest of the world, and also that we should leave the water-
  covered areas out of account altogether in making such a
  calculation. As for the first objection, we can only say that
   it may be a strong and vital one, but we have no definite
  proof as yet. We may of course be quite sure that many
   large areas of the world are very much poorer in coal than
  the United Kingdom, but then again we know that other
  districts are very rich, perhaps even richer than the United
v

              Geological History of the Atmosphere.          319
 Kingdom ; and if the world were better explored it is quite
 possible that many large areas might be found to be very-
 much richer.
    The second objection is undoubtedly a strong one, and
 probably applies with full force to the deep-ocean or abysmal
 areas, which cover about 50 per cent, of the earth's surface.
 But the " transitional " areas, covered by water less than
 6000 feet deep, may quite well be included in our calculation,
as they are regarded as coining within the sphere of ordinary
geological change; that is to say, the alternation from drv
land to sea-bottom and vice versa. At the very least they are
 not too far from the land (and what formerly was dry land)
to contain thick strata of sedimentary rocks derived from
the land by ordinary denudation, and they may therefore be
expected to contain numerous rich deposits of coal. The
continental and transitional areas are estimated to make up
about 50 per cent, of the earth's surface ; and if they contain
as much coal and other carbonaceous matter as would be
equivalent to the whole of our free oxygen, then obviously
they must contain on the average double the amount that has
just been estimated for the United Kingdom, or as much as
would make a layer of coal 5 feet thick over their entire
surface.
   But, on the other hand, it is quite possible that the above
estimate for the United Kingdom is much too low. The
total amount of carbonaceous matter thinly distributed
through many kinds of rock might be many times greater
than that collected into thick seams of coal ; and the same
principle might apply to the rest of the world as well. In
fact the proper way to state our question is to ask, not how
much coal is there in the world (using the word coal in its
ordinary acceptation), but what is the total amount of car
bonaceous matter in the earth's crust? If we knew the
percentage of carbonaceous matter in all geological forma
tions, or if we simply knew the average percentage in a
sufficient number of drill-cores, drilled to a sufficient depth
all over the earth, we might be able to give a fairly good
answer to the question. Many wells and bores have already
been drilled to great depths in many parts of the world, but
probably it is only in comparatively few cases that a definite
or perhaps even an approximate answer could be given if the
question were put as to what was the average percentage of
carbonaceous matter in the whole depth of the bore. No
doubt due note is taken of the general character of the rocks
passed through, but that of itself can give only a very rough
idea of the amount of carbonaceous matter present. I have
                              Z2

320           Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
little doubt, however, but that in the drills or boring trials
¦which have already been made in all parts of the world, to
all degrees of depth and for all kinds of purposes, the average
amount of organic or carbonaceous matter has been at least
 ^g of a per cent, by weight. This is equal to a layer of
coal 5 feet thick in each half-mile thickness of the earth's
crust. It should be noted here that coal has only about half
the specific gravity of other ordinary rocks, and therefore a
 layer of coal must be 5"28 feet thick in order to be equal in
weight to a layer of ordinary rock of similar extent but only
 2*64 feet in thickness— 2"64 feet being j\ per cent, of half
a mile.
    If we assume, then, that the total mass of existing sedi
 mentary rocks on the earth is equal to a stratum of rock half
 a mile thick over the entire continental and transitional areas,
 and that it contains on the average -j1^ per cent, of carbon
 aceous matter, then the total amount of such matter would
 be equal to a layer of coal 5 feet thick over these areas ; and
 this, as we have already seen, would be practically equivalent
to the total free oxygen of the atmosphere.
    Also if, as is quite probable, the total mass of sedimentary
 rocks should be greater than the amount just supposed, then
 obviously the total amount of carbonaceous matter in the
 world would be even greater than the .500,000,000,000,000
 (500 million million) tons which are required to be equivalent
 to our free oxygen. And so far as the percentage of carbon
 aceous matter is concerned, it is just as likely to be over as to
 be under -jV Not only have we the coal itself, which alone
 might possibly reach up to that percentage, but there is the
 carbonaceous matter diffused through all kinds of shales,
 clays, slates, limestones, ironstones, &c. The proportion of
 organic or carbonaceous matter in these rocks is often ^ per
 cent,, and sometimes much more.
    Of course if the total quantity of carbonaceous matter on
 the earth should be greater than 500,000,000,000,000 (500
million million) tons, it would exceed the upper limit laid
 down for it by Lord Kelvin, in the free oxygen of the atmo
 sphere. But after all this consideration introduces no serious
 difficulty into the problem ; at least it can be readily sur
mounted by the hypothesis that the primitive atmosphere of
the earth not only contained no free oxygen, but that it con
tained a considerable quantity of free hydrogen or hydro
carbon gases. It is easy to see how the presence of these
fases would affect the production of free oxygen by vegetation,
  f we assume that the primitive atmosphere of the earth
contained also carbonic-acid gas, and that the primeval

                 Geological History of tlte Atmosphere.           321
 vegetation grew in practieally the samo way as more recent
 vegetation, viz. through the decomposition of carbonic acid
 by sunlight —a process which involves the liberation of free
 oxygen ; the oxygen at first liberated would not remain long
 in the free condition, because it would probably, as may be
 inferred from Dr. Phipson's experiment, soon combine with
 the hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases of the atmosphere to
 form water and carbonic acid. There would tbereforo be no
 permanent free oxygen so long ns free hydrogen or hydro
 carbon gases still remained in the atmosphere, and in the
 meantime a large amount of coal might have been deposited.
    We admit that only indefinite results can be obtained as
 yet by the foregoing method of inquiry, but still they are
definite enough to make a very high estimate of the total
carbonaceous matter in the world quite credible and tenable.
 This view is also fairly well confirmed by studying the question
from the standpoints provided by such general considerations
as the length of geological time, the rate of deposition of
sedimentary rocks, and the rate of the growth of vegetation.
   We have now good reason to suppose that the formation of
coal has been going on for the whole period of geological
history which is recorded for us in sedimentary rocks.
Though ordinary coal has not been found, so far as I am
aware, in Cambrian and Laurentian rocks, graphite has been
found in considerable quantity; and this points with a high
degree of probability to the previous existence of ordinary
bituminous coal. We also know that the deposition of coal
was still going on in Tertiary times, and even now there is
reason to believe that the process is going on to a not in*
considerable extent. If we therefore divide the total amount
of coal by the number of years of geological time, we shall
have the average rate of its annual production. No doubt
estimates of the length of geological time vary very much.
Lord Kelvin's estimate is that about 20,000,000 years have
elapsed since the solidification of the earth's crust from
the liquid condition, and also since the possible and
probable beginnings of vegetable life. If, then, we divide
500,000,000,000,000 by the above figure, we obtain 25,000,000
tons as the average amount of coal that would have to be
deposited annually during the whole of geological time, to give
us an amount equivalent to the free oxygen of the atmosphere.
And if we require, with certain biologists and geologists, a
period of at least 080,000,000 years, the rate of production of coal
becomes very much less, only about 740,000 tons per annum.
These two estimates are no doubt widely divergent, but still
even the larger one is quite a modest and credible figure, and

322     Chemical and Geological History of the Atmosphere.
would still be so though it were multiplied several times in
order to make allowance for coal that may have been destroyed      M
by oxidation after its first deposition and consolidation.
This latter is a point of some importance ; for though coal is not
rendily oxidized by the air at the ordinary temperatures, yet
when organic matter is deposited in contact with oxide of iron
and sulphate of lime, it is very liable to be oxidized, sulphide
of iron being formed at the same time. Probably also, when
rocks containing coal are highly heated by the irruption of
igneous rocks, a quantity of the coal may be oxidized at the
expense of the oxides with which it comes into contact.
However, we need not take much account of such considera
tions at present, and we can say confidently enough that the
presence of a quantity of coal in the earth equivalent to the
whole of our free oxygen is not at all incredible when we
have regard to the length of time during which the deposition
has most probably been going on.
   A similar verdict is obtained if we compare the rate of
deposition required by the above calculations with the rate
of deposition of the other rocks derived from the denudation
of the earth as a whole. Estimates of the rate of denuda
tion no doubt vary just about as much as estimates of the
age of the earth ; but even if we take Darwin's estimate of
1 inch per century, which seems to be regarded as rather a
low estimate, this would give us an annual denudation from
the present land-surface of the earlh of 85,000,000,000 (85
thousand million) tons of rock. This is equal to 3400 times
the 25,000,000 tons of coal that would have to be deposited
annually in order to give us 500,000,000,000,000 tons in
20,000,000 years ; or the average proportion of carbonaceous
matter that would have to be present is only 0-03 per cent.
This seems a modest enough figure when we remember the
great amount of peat that is annually produced in many
parts of the earth, and may be regarded as a geological
deposit, and also the vast quantity of blue mud that is
accumulating on the sea-bottom within the first lew hundred
miles from land. Analyses of this mud would be very useful
if they were available, but at any rate it must contain, or
must have at first contained, sufficient organic matter to change
a considerable amount of oxide of iron and sulphate of lime
 (the latter being derived from sea-water) into sulphide of iron
and carbonate of lime.
   There is no doubt a difficulty in this line of reasoning, due
to the obvious circumstance that as new strata are being
deposited, old ones are worn down and washed away; but
probably this difficulty is not so great as it looks at first.

washed away, the bulk of the old carbonaceous matter may still
help to increase the percentage in the new deposits. However,
even if we should have to make a liberal allowance for the
destruction of old carbonaceous matter by oxidation in some
way or other, the results obtained by this line of inquiry are
not unfavourable to the credibility of a high estimate of the
world's supply of fuel, for all the elements in the above
calculation, required to give us 500,000,000,000,000 tons
of coal, via. (1) the amount of rock annually denuded and
again deposited (85,000,000,000 tons), (2) the length of time
that this denudation has been going on (20,000,000 years),
and (3) the proportion of organic matter present (0-03 per
cent.), are more likely, taken as a whole, to err on the side of
being estimated too low than of being estimated too high.

     Equating this to the effective weight $irg{a — p)a", we obtain

 the liquid.
     This equation only holds good when the velocity is so small
 that squares may be neglected. Those terms in the equations
  of motion of the fluid which represent its inertia are ne
 glected in comparison with those due to its viscosity*. Con
  sideration of these terms shows that Vpa must be small com
 pared with fi. Or if we write /* = vp, so that v is the kinematic
 coefficient of viscosity, Va must be small compared with v.

   The small value of the critical radius in all practical cases
renders the direct verification of the formula for the terminal
velocity difficult. For a particle of sand falling through
water at 15° 0. (/i = "0115), taking a=2p, the critical radius
is "0085 centim. Unless the radius of the particle is smaller
than this, the solution founded upon the type of infinitely
slow motion is inapplicable.
                  2. Steady Flow in a Uniform Tube.
   In considering the motion of a sphere through a viscous
fluid it is instructive to recall the results arrived at in the
somewhat analogous case of the flow of a viscous fluid through
a uniform pipe or channel. When the motion is steady, the
accelerating force must be exactly balanced by the resistance
due to fluid viscosity.
    If the flow is rectilinear, the hydraulic gradient —that is the
fall in pressure per unit length of the tube—is proportional to
the first power of the mean velocity.
    Hagen * and Reynolds t have shown independently that
rectilinear flow is only possible in practice when the velocity
is less than a certain maximum amount, the " critical velocity,"
depending on the radius of the tube and the viscosity and
density of the fluid. When the velocity exceeds this value
the flow becomes turbulent.
     The existence of a definite critical velocity has been
 questioned. According to Lord Kelvin's view j the steady
 motion of a fluid is theoretically stable for infinitely small
 disturbances for any viscosity however small. This stability
 may not extend beyond very narrow limits ; so that in practice
 under finite disturbances the motion would be unstable except
 for sufficiently viscous fluids.
     This view has been criticized by Lord Rayleigh in a paper
 " On the Question of the Stability of the Flow of Fluids "§.
     Practically, at least, we seem justified in accepting the idea
 of a critical velocity at which eddying motion begins.
     The law of resistance in the turbulent regime has been
 investigated by several observers ||. The results may be
 expressed by taking the hydraulic gradient proportional to

  3. Lata of Resistance to the Movement of a Sphere when the
                       Motion is Sinuous.
   When the velocity of the sphere moving uniformly in an
infinite fluid becomes so great that eddying motion is set up,
we have no means of determining theoretically the way in
which the resistance varies. In the parallel case of the flow
of liquids through pipes the empirical results show that the
resistance may be taken proportional to some power of the
velocity. If ice assume that the resistance, R, to the motion
of a solid sphere may in like manner be taken proportional to
V", so that it may be represented by a single term,

we may employ the principle of dynamical similarity to deter

   If n were equal to §, the terminal velocity would be pro-

   If n were equal to 2, the square of the terminal velocity
would be proportional to the radius, and the resistance would
he independent of tlie viscosity, while, if it were possible for n
to be greater than 2, the resistance would increase as the
fluidity increased.

                   4. Motion of a Fluid Sphere.
   The present investigation was commenced, at the suggestion
of Prof. J. J. Thomson, to see whether the velocity acquired
by small bubbles of gas ascending through a liquid would
conform to the theoretical result for a solid sphere, and, if
possible, to derive some information as to the existence of
sliding friction in this case.
   The question of the applicability of the formula to the
motion of a liquid sphere has already been discussed in a
paper read before the Physical Society by 0. G. Jones*, who
made a series of experiments in which globules of mercury
were dropped through highly viscous fluids, and their velo
cities determined. He assumed that the globule might be
treated as spherical, and that the coefficient /9 was infinite.
Lord ltayleigh observed that thero might be circulation within
the globule; and Dr. Burton pointed out that with perfectly
liquid spheres there would be infinite slip, and /9 would there
fore be zero. Later experiments based on the same assump
tions were made by A. W. Duff t, who employed the measure
ments of the velocities of mercury globules aud small shot in
glycerin or paraffin to detect any change in viscosity due to
an electrostatic field.
   If the fluid in the interior of a globule ascending or de
scending in a liquid is in circulation, the viscosity of the fluid
of which the globule is composed must affect its velocity.
But when the globule is a bubble of air, the internal friction
is so small that its effect on the velocity may be safely
neglected.
   We have also to assume that when the bubble is sufficiently

 328            Mr. H. S. Allen cm the Motion of
 small, the surface-tension is great enough to keep its form
 sensibly spherical. Further, any effect due to the existence
 of waves on the surface has to be disregarded.
    All these effects would have to be considered in a complete
 solution of the problem ; but it appears certain that in the
 slow motion of a small bubble they would enter only as cor
 rections to the velocity calculated for a solid sphere with a
 definite amount of slipping at the surface.
     5. Method of determining the Velocity of Small Bubbles.
    The apparatus used is shown in the diagram (fig. 1). A is
 a long glass tube whose bore is very large compared with the
 diameter of the bubbles observed, it is closed at the lower
 end by a cork through which pass two tubes, one serving to
 draw off the liquid, and the other to furnish the bubbles. This
 second tube ends within the receiver in a fine capillary tube,
 while outside it is connected with a pressure-tube containing
 mercury.
    The method of procedure for the production of bubbles is as
 follows:—The pressure-tube, including the lower part of the
 T-piece, is filled with mercury, and the pinch-cock is closed.
The capillary tube, made by drawing out one end of a short piece
 of clean tubing of the same bore as the T-piece, is securely
 attached to the upper end of the latter by a rubber joint.
The cork is then inserted and the receiver filled with the
 liquid to be used. By raising the pressure-tube and opening
 the pinch-cock the air -enclosed in the vertical limb of the
T-piece is driven out in a stream of bubbles. The pressure-
tube is lowered until this stream just ceases, and the pinch-
cock is again closed. The pressure of the fingers on the
rubber tube is then sufficient to form the bubbles when
required. In this way single bubbles or groups of two or
three can be detached at will. The bubbles are so small that
the air enclosed is sufficient to produce a very large number ;
but if necessary more air can be introduced by lowering the
pressure-tube and opening the clamp at the free end of the
T-piece.
   As the pressure employed in starting the bubbles is some
times as much as an atmosphere, care must be taken to see
that all joints are perfectly secure.
   There is a considerable fascination in watching the forma
tion and ascent of these bubbles. The smaller bubbles ascend
with extreme steadiness ; but when large bubbles are formed
from a comparatively wide capillary they ascend in a spiral
curve round the tube, and are seen to be in continual

                 a Sphere in a Viscous Fluid.               329
oscillation. When two small bubbles come into contact during
their ascent they sometimes rebound as if they were elastic
spheres, and at other times coalesce to form a larger bubble.
It is a common thing to see two bubbles of the same size
ascending together, at a distance apart perhaps ten times
the diameter of either, with the line joining their centres
making an angle of 45° with the vertical.

   The behaviour of the different capillary tubes used pre
sented some interesting features. With thick-walled tubes
the bubbles produced were of practically the same size for
any particular tube.
   With very tine thin-walled capillaries the size of the bubble

330           Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion oj
depended to some extent on the pressure employed in separat
ing it. Frequently, with such tubes, several bubbles were
detached one after the other, those in front being larger than
those behind. Some of these bubbles were so minute as to
be only just visible. It is suggested that in these cases the
larger bubbles were produced by the practically instantaneous
 formation of a number of the very minute bubbles.
   The behaviour of one of these fine tubes would differ con
siderably at different times, no doubt in consequence of the
particular state of cleanliness of the tube or the deposit of
some minute particle. Thus a tube which had been giving a
a small cloud of fine bubbles would suddenly refuse to give
anything but a much larger bubble of fairly constant size.
   The terminal velocities of the bubbles were measured by
observing the times of ascent through distances marked on
the vertical tube. The times were taken with a stop-watch
or chronometer.
   It is necessary to measure the size of a bubble whose
velocity has been determined. The simple arrangement
shown in fig. 2 was constructed to catch the bubble at the

a microscope fitted with a micrometer eyepiece and measured.
To two microscope cover-glasses, 2£ centim. and \\ centiin.
in diumeter respectively, were cemented with Canada balsam
glass rings of rather smaller diameter.
   The smaller cup thus formed was suspended, mouth down
wards, in the top of the receiver by three silk fibres. When
the bubble to be examined had entered from below, the larger
cup was slipped underneath by means of a handle of wire,
and the whole was lifted out and transferred to the stage of
the microscope. The diameter of the bubble now in contact

The bubbles are so small that, although they are in contact
with a plane glass surface, they may be considered spherical.
   The following results make up the first complete set ob
tained, and are given for that reason only. The temperature
was about 15° C, but was not specially noted. The velocities

    In the last three observations recorded in the table the
radius of the bubble was determined by collecting a large
number of equal bubbles and finding the volume they
occupied.
   The results are plotted in fig. 3 (p. 332) with the radius as
abscissa and the velocity as ordinate. In the same diagram
 are shown the theoretical results for a solid sphere falling
 through water at 15°, assuming <r=2p. The parabola for
 which )8 = oo corresponds to the case of no slip, and that for
 which j8=0 to the case of infinite slip. The " critical" points
 are marked by stars.
    It will be seen that the observed points lie on a straight
line cutting the line of zero velocity not far from the origin.
Hence

where b is a small constant quantity.
    For velocities greater than the critical velocity the terminal
velocity of small bubbles is proportional to the radius
 diminished by a small constant.
    If we employ the principle of dynamical similarity in
 the manner already illustrated, to determine the form of the
quantity K, we obtain

  The vulue of the constant k must be -518 if the line drawn in
  the diagram is to be represented by the formula. We may
  simplify the result by assuming k = ^, a course only justified
  by the fact that later observations agree sufficiently well with
  the simplified formula.
     Again the constant l> must be of the dimensions of a length.
  Now the only length available for comparison is the critical
  radius a. Hence we may suppose b expressed as a certain
  fraction of the critical radius, whose value at 15° is '0085
  centim. From the diagram we find h=% a, nearly. Thus

     One difficulty in determining the velocity of a bubble by
 this method has not yet been alluded to. This arises from the
 fact that the volume of the bubble does not remain constant.
 Two causes will be active in changing the volume of a bubble
 of gas ascending through a liquid —the change in pre-sure and
 the gradual solution of the gas in the liquid. In the case of small
 bubbles the second cause generally predominates. Using
 ordinary distilled water it was found that for velocities
 greater than about 1 centim. per second there was practically
 no difference between the times for the first and second
 half of an ascent of 72 centim , but for velocities less than
 this the second half of the journey took longer than the first.
 Estromely small bubbles were dissolved before travelling the
 whole distance.
    1 sought to overcome this difficulty by bubbling air through
 the water used for a long period so as to get a saturated
 solution. However, the most satisfactory series of results
 was obtained on a day on which the temperature fell to about
 8°C. and so gave rise to sufficiently complete saturation.
    The results are given in Table II.
    The calculated values for the velocity are given in two
columns. In the first are the values calculated from the
formula of Stokes (Parabolic formula), in the second are those
found from the empirical relation given above (Linear
formula). The critical radius, assuming »< = -01404 at 8C-4 C,
is equal to '00967 centim.
    On comparing the calculated and observed results it will
be seen that for bubbles less than the critical size the velocities
tend to agreement with the theoretical values ; for larger
bubbles the velocities agree with those given by the linear
formula.

    Although considerable time was spent in the endeavour to
 penetrate further into the region of non-sinuous flow the
 small value of the critical radius in the case of water made it
 difficult to obtain results that were entirely satisfactory. It
 was therefore decided to employ a more viscous liquid for
 which the critical radius would have a greater value. For
 this purpose aniline was selected. Its coefficient of viscositv,
 as determined by Wijkander J at 12° 0., is '06023 (about five
 times that of water at the same temperature) and its specific
 gravity (%) is 1/038. The critical radius calculated from
 these values is -0255 centim.
     The experiments were carried out in the same manner as in
 the case of water. The numerical results are given in
 Table III.

    An inspection of this table shows that when the radius of
 the bubble is as great as one-half the critical radius the
 velocity agrees with that deduced on the assumption of
 parallel flow, supposing that no slipping occurs at the
 boundary. For bubbles of larger size the velocity agrees
 with that calculated by means of the empirical formula.

336             Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion of
       6. Terminal Velocities attained by Solid Spheres.
   As long as we are restricted to comparatively small
velocities, less for instance than 10 centim. per second, it is
necessary to employ spheres of small radius, unless the density
of the sphere is very nearly the same as that of the liquid.
 In the latter case great precautions must lie taken to ensure
the temperature remaining constant from place to place, and
from time to time.
   A series of experiments were made with spheres of pure
paraffin, of specific gravity (W'07. The spheres were formed
 by melting a small piece of paraffin in a mixture of alcohol
and water whose density was adjusted so as to be the same
as that of the melted paraffin. On shaking the warm mix
ture the paraffin broke up into a large number of small
globules which solidified without losing their spherical form.
The most perfect spheres were selected for the experiments,
and their diameters were measured under the microscope.
   These spheres were allowed to rise in a wide tube inverted
in a basin of liquid and tilled by suction at the upper end.
   The first experiments were made on paraffin spheres rising
through water. As the water did not wet the spheres it was
found impossible to avoid small air-bubbles clinging to them
and travelling with them up the tube. Irregularities were
thus introduced into the result which prevent great importance
being attached to them. However, the observations when
plotted are found to cluster round the line represented by the
empirical formula.
   Better results were obtained from experiments on the
ascent of paraffin spheres in aniline, although in this case also
care had to be exercised to prevent the presence of air-
bubbles. The results are given in Table IV. The critical
radius is about "051 centim.
   In order still further to test the applicability of the formula
six small amber spheres were turned for me by a working
jeweller, with what success is shown by the maximum varia
tions from the mean radius given in Table V. Amber was
selected for these spheres because its density is slightly
greater than that of water. The density was determined by
finding that of a saline solution in which the spheres would
neither rise nor sink. The observed velocities and those
calculated from the empirical formula are given in the last
two columns. Although the agreement in some cases is far
from good, it is still sufficiently striking when we consider
that the formula was derived from observations on air-bubbles
ascending in water.

             7. Conclusions from these Observations.
  We arrive then at the following conclusions :—
   (1) The terminal velocity acquired by a small bubble
        ascending through a viscous fluid is the same as that
        which would be acquired by a solid sphere of the same
        size and of density differing from that of the fluid by
        the same amount.
   (2) When the motion is so slow that no eddies are set up
        in the fluid the velocity of the bubble agrees with that
        deduced from theoretical considerations by Stokes, on
        the assumption that no slipping occurs at the boundary.
   (3) When the velocity exceeds a definite critical value,
        the terminal velocity of bubbles and solid spheres is
        given by the empirical formula
                    V = /ip-a.

   XXXII. The Spectra of Hydrogen and the Spectrum of
          Ayueous Vapour. By John Trowbridge*.
IT is customary to consider that there are two spectra
      characteristic of hydrogen — a four-line spectrum, so-
called, and another consisting of many lines widely dis
tributed through the spectrum, known as the white spectrum.
The four-line spectrum appears when a condenser-discharge
is employed with what is called dry hydrogen ; it is also
readily produced in steam and water-vapour. From the fact
that a condenser-discharge seems necessary to excite it in dry
hydrogen, it is supposed to indicate a higher temperature
than the white spectrum.
   The four-line spectrum is found in the atmosphere of the
sun ; and is a characteristic spectrum of certain types of stars.
There are also other linos attributed to hydrogen in the stars
which are supposed to indicate conditions of pressure and
temperature which perhaps can be imitated and studied in
laboratories.
   I propose to show in this paper that conclusions in regard
to temperature and pressure of hydrogen in celestial bodies,
deduced from observations on hydrogen enclosed in glass
tubes, are untrustworthy ; and that electrical dissociation must

        Hydrogen and live Spectrum of Aqueous Vaj>our.         339
 be considered as a most important element in determining
 the characteristics of a gaseous spectrum—more important
indeed than the question of pressure and apparent tempera
ture. I shall give my reasons for believing that the four-
line spectrum of hydrogen in the atmosphere of the sun is an
evidence of aqueous vapour in that atmosphere, and therefore
is an evidence of the existence of oxygen in the sun. The
conviction is forced upon me that the term dry hydrogen is a
misnomer when the gas is subjected in glass vessels to con
denser-discharges, or to sufficiently powerful steady currents
of electricity.
    The bibliography of the subject of the spectra of hydrogen
is so extensive that 1 must, with due regard to the limits of
 this article, refer the reader to the reports of the Committees
of the British Association on the subject of Spectrum Analysis,
and to the recognized authorities on this subject; and I do
 this because I feel that in my experiments I have exceeded
the experimental limits of previous investigators, for I have
been enabled to employ more powerful electrical discharges
than have been hitherto possible. My work therefore does
not trench in this respect upon that of previous investigators.
   The source of the electrical energy 1 employed was twenty
thousand storage-cells of the Plantd type. The direct current
from these cells, through a liquid resistance, was used to
produce the white spectrum ; and a glass condenser consisting
of 300 plates of glass, each plate having a coated surface of
lb" x 20 inches, with a total capacity of about 18 microfarads,
was charged by the cells to produce the four-line spectrum.
    I had great difficulty at first in obtaining tubss which would
stand such powerful discharges. I began my work with end-
on tubes, which were closed by plates of quartz luted on with
silicate of soda. The electrodes were hollow cylinders of
aluminium connected to thick pieces of platinum wire.
These wires passed through the wails of the glass tubes and
were immersed in large vessels of distilled mercury. After
considerable experience, tubes were constructed which would
resist the disruptive and heating effect of the discharges.
This form of tube, however, was abandoned for another shown
in fig. 1. The chief peculiarity of this form of tube was an
.e-ray bulb in place of the end covered with a quartz plate.
Tho reason for the adoption of this form of tube is this :—it
was necessary to heat the entire tube to a high temperature
for a long period during the process of exhaustion to drive
out the air and aqueous vapour before it was filled with
hydrogen ; and this heating was impossible with a tube having
a luted-on end. Moreover, the thin glass of the bulb did not

340           Prof. J. Trowbridge on the Spectra of
appreciably absorb the ultra-violet rays until the wave-length
1800 was reached ; and this absorption did not affect my
conclusions, since my work was confined to the portion of the
spectrum studied by astrophysicists. The diameter of the
 narrowest portion of the tubes was about 1 centiin. I employed
 still another form of tube, shown also in fig. 1. At one side
of this tube there was an adjunct consisting of a palladium
tube P, joined on the outside of the spectrum-tube to a
platinum wire which was inserted in the walls of the tube.
A glnss vessel filled with dilute sulphuric acid slipped over
the palladium tube. At one end of this glass vessel was
inserted a platinum wire. The palladium tube was made the
cathode, and this platinum wire the anode of a battery. In
this way hydrogen is liberated on the surface of the palladium,
is occluded, and can be made to pass into the spectrum-tube*.
    The tubes which were not provided with palladium tubes
were filled with hydrogen or nitrogen through a series of
tubes filled with caustic potash—and through a number of
tubes filled with phosphoric pentoxide provided with partitions
of glass-wool. After many attempts, I adopted the following
arrangement of these tubes which proved satisfactory. In the
first place, I found it necessary to discard all gums or other
adhesive material and to use ground-glass joints and mercury
          * A device due to Dr. William Rolling, Boston, U.S.

          Ut/tlrouen and the Spectrum of Aqueous Vapour.      341
   seals for these joints, having satisfied myself that all other
   forms of connexions consume time and are worthless. The
   tubes were mounted on a board, and after the joints had been
   adjusted, the final adjustment to the gas-holder could be
   readily and safely accomplished by means of a rack and
   pinion which raised or lowered by slow degree the gas-holder
   (J, fig. i. This drying arrangement could be exhausted to a
   high degree, and would hold the rarefied gas as long as
   desired. The method of filling the tubes was as follows: —
   The spectrum-tube was exhausted to about 1 millim., having
                                Fig. 2.

   been repeatedly filled with hydrogen. This operation was
   continued until the hydrogen spectrum appeared. Finally,
   the tube was exhausted to the ,r-rav stage by long heating
   and by employing a condenser-discharge. Then the dried
   gas was admitted until a pressure of about "1 millim. remained
   in the tube. The vessels with palladium tubes wero carefully
   exhausted to the ,r-ray stage (and beyond, a spark preferring
   to jump six inches in air to passing through the tube). When
   these spectrum-tubes, with the palladium adjunct, were con

  .'542         Prof. J. Trowbridge on the Spectra of
  nected to the terminals of tbe battery, a slight heating was
  sufficient to start a discharge and to cause the occluded
 hydrogen to appear in the spectrum-tube.
     The operation of heating the spectrum-tubes is highly
 important.       Moreover, tbe discharge from a condenser
 should be employed in tbe process of exhaustion, and the
 operation should lie continued for several hours*.
      Experience in tbe preparation of a?-ray tubes is almost
 essential to one who essays to investigate the spectra of gases.
 The vacuum-pump I employed was a modification of IJapp's
 pump. It was automatic. There was but one valve, and tbe
 number of ground-glass joints with mercury seals was reduced
 to a minimum. Tbe hydrogen was produced by the electro
 lysis of phosphoric acid and doubly-distilled water. The gas-
 bolder contained many litres of the gas. Tbe nitrogen was
 prepared bypassing air through ammonia water, then through
 heated copper gauze. The resulting gas was then passed
 through tubes filled with caustic potash, and finally through
 tubes of phosphoric pentoxide.
     The spectroscope consisted of a Rowland grating with a
 ruled surface five inches by two inches, and a radius of
 curvature of sixty inches. Tbe dispersion was small on
 account of the small number of lines to the inch ; but it had
 the advantage of exhibiting tbe salient features of the spectra
 on one plate with a dispersion of the order used by astro
 physicists, and thus enabled comparisons to be readily made.
 The distance between the great H lines in the second spectrum
 was approximately 2 milliin. The camera was on an arm
iiivoted at half the distance between the grating and the slit,
  ^his arrangement was adopted for compactness. The grating
and camera were enclosed in a light-tight box ; and a lever
 enabled me to expose the plate when this box was closed.
     Various liquid resistances were employed to regulate tbe
strength of tbe electric current. I filially used distilled water
which was kept running through a glass tube. My object
was not to measure the currents, but rather to keep them
within safe limits. I did not find it necessary therefore to
employ cadmium terminals in a solution of iodide of cadmium.
The direct battery-current gave me the white type of hydrogen
spectrum, while the second type was given by condenser-dis
charges. A revolving drum provided with suitable metallic
strips enabled me to safely charge and discharge the con
densers through the spectrum-tubes.
   • In this subject of exhaustion of tubes I am much indebted to sug
gestions of Dr. William Ui.llin.s and Mr. lleinze of l?t ston, who have had
lung experience in the preparation of .r-rny tubes.

       Fhjdnxje* <tmd th* Spectrum of A'pieouj Y'ipour.        343
   In working with powerful wndenser-discharges, I found
that I obtained essentially the sime spectrum whether the
tnbe was filled with hydrogen, raivfied air. or nitrogen, not
withstanding the great care token in heating the tube* and
drving the gases. This characteristic spectrum was that of
water-rapour, containing lin^ of hvdrogen. of oxygen, and
rarefied air. The employment, therefore, of a condenser-dis
charge in glass tubes apparently drives off aqueous vapour
from the glass walls, even if extraordinary care is taken to
expel such vapour in the process of exhausting such tubes.
My experiments entirely confirm Professor Crookes's state
ments on this point. Glass seems to be of a permeable nature,
and in the process of manufacture is doubtless filled with
gases which reveal themselves when disruptive electrical dis
charges are employed. It does not seem possible that dry
hydrogen can exist as such in a glass vessel when it is sub
jected to a condenser-discharge; and I therefore believe that
the spectrum of hydrogen called the four-line spectrum is an
evidence of the presence of aqueous vapour, for i: can be
 produced with tbe greatest ease when we are certain that this
 vaj>our is present. This spectrum, to my mind, is an evidence
 of the presence of oxygen iu the sun's atmosphere.
    The true spectrum of hydrogen seems to be tbe white
 spectrum. This is developed by a steady current which
 should not exceed a certain strength, for a powerful one
 drives off also rarefied air from the walls of the tabe ; and
 there is a process of occlusion set up if large metallic terminals
 are employed. Such large terminals are necessary if very
 strong currents are used. With large aluminium electrodes,
 under the action of strong currents, spectra of the com
 binations of nitrogen with oxygen and hydrogen are pro
 duced in tubes which have been filled with dry and pure
 h)drogen. When such tubes have l>een subjected to powerful
 currents, it seems impossible to refil them with pure hydrogen.
 In one case I filled a tube with pure dry nitrogen, and passed
 a current through it sufficiently powerful to melt down one of
 the aluminium hollow cylinders which formed an electrode.
 The aluminium was filled with cavities as if gases had bubbled
 from the interior. When this tube was filled with dry
 hydrogen, it gave again spectra of compounds of nitrogen
 with no trace of the hydrogen spectrum. A powerful con
 denser discharge, however, produced the aqueous-vapour
 spectrum. Hydrogen is thus extremely elusive when sub
 jected in glass vessels with metallic electrodes, and in the.
  presence of other gases, to electrical dissociation. Indeed,
  a steady strong battery-current can be employed at u certniiv

  344          Prof. J. Trowbridge on the Spectra of
  stage of exhaustion to occlude hydrogen to such a degree
  that the state of exhaustion in the spectrum-tube is apparently
  raised, and no discharge can be forced through it until it is
  subjected to external heat. This occlusion or destructive
 electrical dissociation is very much in evidence when the
  terminals of a battery of ten or twenty thousand cells are
 connected to an x-ray tube through a resistance of several
 megohms. If this tube is properly exhausted, that is by
 repeated heating and by the use of electrical discharges, no
 current can be forced through it unless the tube is repeatedly
 flashed with a powerful Bunsen burner. Suddenly, however,
 under the action of heat a blue cloud arises in the tube ; the
 cathode beam appears ; the anti-cathode grows white-hot, and
 the exterior resistance must be speedily increased to save the
 tube. The pressure has apparently been greatly diminished ;
 but the experiment of Dr. William Rollins with two connected
 .r-ray tubes, one of which is heated and the other not, the
 heated one carrying a current while the unheated one resists
 even an eight-inch spark, shows that this is not the case, and
that we have to deal with electrical dissociation and not with
a change of pressure. Let us follow this experiment further.
Presently the blue cloud in the tube grows smaller ; the
cathode-beam disappears, and the cloud slowly sinks into the
positive electrode. At that moment the arrays flash out with
great brilliancy ; but in a few seconds the light in the tube is
totally extinguished, and a further heating from an external
source is necessary before a current can be again forced
through the tube and the phenomena can be repeated. It
can be repeated, however, as often as desired, although the
apparent resistance of the tube is undoubtedly raised by a
more or less permanent occlusion of what 1 believe is water-
vapour. This experiment strongly recalls the familiar one of
the glowing of platinum under a stream of non-ignited
hydrogen. The electrical dissociation of the aqueous vapour
evidently produces an intense heat at the anti-cathode, and
the .r-rays are emitted during this dissociation.
    If we suppose that there are material bodies circulating
about the sun which are charged negatively while the sun is
charged positively, we might conceive of a similar action of
a difference of potential on rarefied aqueous vapour which
might be competent to produce a corona.
    The white spectrum of hydrogen produced by the hydrogen
coming from palladium is, in its main features, similar to that
obtained from electrolytic hydrogen which has been passed
through the drying apparatus I adopted. There are, how
ever, some bands which need examination to determine

   The general character of the spectral lines of hydrogen in
respect to breadth and intensity, seems not to depend so much
upon mere pressure and apparent temperature (temperature
deduced from calculations of electrical energy in electrical
discharges), as upon electrical dissociations of gases : of
aqueous vapour, for instance, in the presence of an excess or
a small supply of oxygen. I believe, therefore, that any con
clusions in regard to temperature and pressure of hydrogen
in the stars, deduced from laboratory experiments with
electrical discharges in glass vessels, are misleading; since we
have to do mainly with phenomena of electrical dissociation,
and not alone with those of pressure and apparent tempera
ture—that is temperature which can be measured by calori-
metric methods, or which can be calculated from the electrical
dimensions of the circuit which is employed.
   It would seem, therefore, that the study of electrical disso

ciation is necessary for the solution of problems relating to
the condition of gases in the atmosphere of the sun and in
that of the stars. This seems to be a logical necessity since
the electromagnetic theory is far-reaching ; and sensible heat
is only one of the manifestations of electrical energy.
   My conclusions are as follows: —
    1. When a condenser-discharge is sent through a rarefied
gas which is confined in a glass vessel, the gas can no longer
be considered in the dry state; for aqueous vapour is liberated
from the glass. When a sufficiently powerful condenser-
discharge is employed, dry hydrogen, dry nitrogen, and
rarefied air give substantially the same characteristic spectrum.
When a very powerful steady battery-current is used to
excite the tubes filled with these gases, various compounds of
nitrogen and oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen, are formed if
aluminium electrodes are employed.
    2. The four-line spectrum of hydrogen in the solar atmo
sphere is an evidence of aqueous vapour, and therefore of
oxygen, in the sun.
   3. Conclusions in regard to the temperature of the stars,
exhibiting hydrogen spectra, are misleading if based upon
conditions of pressure and temperature in glass vessels ; for
conditions of electrical dissociation, of aqueous vapour, for
instance, in the presence of an excess or lack of supply of
oxygen, are the controlling ones rather than conditions of the
mere pressure of the gas.
    4. ar-ray phenomena, produced by a steady battery-current,
strongly suggest an electrical theory of the origin of the sun's
corona.

XXXIII. An Application of the Method of Stria to the Illu

    Wood *.
                               [Plate III.]
HAVING recently made considerable use of Toepler's
         " Schlieren-Methode," it occurred to me to see to what
extent this most sensitive means of rendering visible minute
differences in refractive index could be applied to the illumi
nation of objects under the microscope. The deflexion of a
long ray of light by the striae in the object to be observed,
being the fundamental principle of the method, it seemed at
     * Communicated by the Physical Society : read June 8th, 1900.

  .'148   (hi the Illumination of Objects under the Microscope.
  first sight quite hopeless to get results in the short space
  between the microscope-objective and the ohject, and I was
  much surprised to find how well the method worked, even
  under these unfavorable conditions. On looking over tho
  ' Beiblatter ' of the AnnaUn I found, after finishing my obser
  vations, that a similar al tempt had been made by W. Seibert,
  and described in the Zeitschrift fur Instrumentenkunde, u.
  p. 1*2 (1892). With what success the work was attended I
  do not know, since, at the present moment, I am unable to
  get access to the early numbers of this journal.
     With this preliminary statement I feel warranted in
  presenting to the Society the results of my observations, as I
  feel sure that in certain oases the method can be used to
  advantage in the examination of microscopical objects, in
  which the detail is lost owing to an almost uniform optical
  density.
     I chose as an object some powdered glass, immersed in
  cedar oil of the same mean refractive index.          The gla-s
 particles were almost invisible under ordinary conditions of
 illumination, as by the use of the substage condenser and
 diaphragm it was just possible to see the. outline of some
 of the larger particles, but nothing whatever could be seen of
 their actual form.
     I then arranged the illuminating system as follows : —
 A screen bounded by a straight edge is placed in front of an
 incandescent gas-lamp, so as to cut off half of the mantle and
 give a source of light bounded by one perfectly straight side.
 (A gas-flame with a horizontal screen does about as well.)
 A small lens of very short focus was placed on the stage, or
 rather below the stage, as close as possible to the object.
The lamp was at a distance of six feet, and the light reflected
 from the mirror was brought to a focus by this lens, passing
 through the object on its way. An image of the lamp is
 formed in space by the lens, and by raising the tube of the
 microscope the image can be seen. A §-inch objective was
 used, the difficulties increasing as we use objectives of shorter
focus. A little strip of thin brass, with a carefully-cut
straight edge, was fastened to the stand carrying the " bull's-
eye " condenser with a bit of wax, and moved into position
between the objective and object, so as to cut off the flame-
image with the exception of a narrow thread of light along
the straight edge. It is important to have the brass screen
set accurately in the plane of the fame- image with its edge
parallel to the straight edge of the fame. This adjustment
must be made with the microscope focussed on the flame-
image, the brass strip being raised and lowered until it is also

              On the General Afotion of Long Waves.           343
 in locus. It is then advanced over the flame until nearly all
 the light is cut off. On lowering the microscope-tube until
 the object is once more in focus, and carefully advancing
 the brass strip until practically all of the flame-image is cut
 off, we shall find that suddenly the glass particles appear with
 most astonishing sharpness, every irregularity, angle, and
 facet showing as distinctly as if we were dealing with great
 lumps of glass in air. The two photographs accompanying
 this paper (PI. III.) were taken of the same "field" of glass
 fragments in oil— one with ordinary illumination, the other
 by the Schlieren-Methode. It is important to choose a lens
 of such focus that its focal plane shall be half a millimetre
 or so below the objective when the microscope is focussed,
 on the object. The scheme is shown in the diagram.

                                                 SrAte
    While I doubt if this method will be found to have a very
wide application, it appears to me that in certain special
cases, perhaps in the examination of rock-sections, it may
prove useful. From the nature of things it cannot very
well be used with high powers, at least it is not so sensitive
under such circumstances.
XXXIV. The General Motion of Long Waves, with an E.ra-
    mination of the Direct Reflexion of the Solitary Wave. By
    R. F. Gwyther, M.A.*
ALTHOUGH most of the interesting cases of fluid motion
        are of the steadily progressive type, there are many
cases worthy of consideration in which the conditions of pro
gressive motion are not satisfied ; and it is here proposed to
deal with the case of long waves to a first approximation in tho
most general manner.
                   » Communicated by the Author.

350                 Mr. R. F. Gwyther on the
   For this purpose I shall extern! to this case the general
principles of the method whereby in a late paper* I attempted
to deal with the steady motion of long waves, by finding the
differential equation which the velocity-potential must approxi
mately satisfy.
   § 1. Taking
                     </>+if = F(* + ip,t)                    (1)
to represent a state of molion in fluid otherwise at rest, the
condition expressing that the pressure is constant along the
free surface may be written
                   2ffh=2M + u* + i/>-2J>, . . . . . (2)
where h is an absolute constant.
   Expanding this, and replacing differential coefficients of <f>
by their values from (1), and being guided in approximating
by the hypothesis that we are dealing with a long icave, we
obtain
           2,;/i=x2^+F'»-(F'F/"-F"%« + &c.
                      -2F + F'y-&c                        . (3)
   This may be looked upon as the equation to the free sur
face ; but in order that this may continually be the case, we
shall have a condition, obtained by operating with
This condition is
        0 = 2{g + (F"-F'F'" + F"»)y} fv"t/-F" |^,|
              -{2F'F"-2F' + F'V} | F'-F"'!* j
              + 2F'F'-2F+F'y + &c                            (4)
   Substituting in this from (3) for y, and retaining only the
most important of the terms under our hypothesis, we finally
obtain
      2{ghY"-¥) +2(FF" + 2F'F') -3F'2F"
                              + F"A«-F"^=0.         .  .   . (5)
   This is the general equation which 1 proposed to find,
being that which, to a first approximation, the function F
must satisfy in any lovg-ware motion.

   It must be admitted that it does not appear possible to pro
ceed further with the general discussion of this equation ; and
that might be expected from the very extensive range of
motions to which the equation applies. It will still be possible
to learn something from the equation in special questions.
   § 2. But first it seems desirable to test the correctness by
considering the simpler case of progressive motion.
   For this purpose write F(x, t) in the form F(ct + x), so
that F=cF'.
   The equation (5) then reduces to
    (f " '^) h*F"= 8F iV"~ 6cF'F" + 2 (C* ~gh) F"' * (6^
which agrees with that, viz,
            {f- $) Ay"'=/',-3qr*+2(C*-Wr,
obtained in the paper referred to above, when it is remem
bered that we have now performed a differentiation in excess.
   It is easily seen that, if we neglect the term 3F'9F", as we
may generally do, one form of solution is
                   F(ct-\-;v)=atan\im(ct + z), ....            (7)

                                     c
a form which suits the circumstances of a low Solitary Wave.
   § 3. I shall now select a special question on which to employ
the general equation (5).
   In his experiments on the Solitary Wave, Scott Russell
found that, with moderate elevations, it was directly reflected
from a vertical wall so as to travel without appreciable change
of profile or of rate of progression, and, in his experimental
investigations to secure exact measurements, the wave was
always so reflected at the ends of the trough along which
it ran.
   For the purpose of investigating the mathematical con
ditions of such a reflexion, the ordinary treatment of progressive
motion will not suffice.
   To represent the circumstances, let us replace in (5)
F(*, 0 by
                    Fl(<* + *) + F,(*-«),                       (8)

representing two Solitary Waves of similar circumstances
except for their different directions of propagation, and
meeting at the plane #=0 at the time t = 0. This will serve
in place of a single wave reflected at the wall .« = 0.
    Still neglecting the small term, F] and F2 are each sepa
rately solutions of (5); and therefore the terms which remain
in (5) unsatisfied become
                         2c[F1"F3'-F2"F,'}.
    Replacing F! and F2 by the function a tanh, this becomes
          iahu'c sech3 m(cl + tf)sech sm(ct— x) sinh 2mrt, . (9)
    From this expression, or from general considerations, we see
that if ct + x and ct — x are widely different from zero, the
term will be very small. Also when x and ct are small, its
value may be estimated as
                          4a2m3c sinh 2 met,
which, as both m and ct are small, is of the order of the
terms we are neglecting. The expression reaches its maximum,
about 2\3m3a2c, at the wall, at the time given by cosh 2mct — %
before or after the crest of the wave reaches the wall, being
both temporary and local.
    The condition that (3) may approximately give the form of
the free surface is therefore closely satisfied, and the mathe
matical theory agrees with the experiment il investigation
that the direct reflexion of a Solitary Wave will have an incon
siderable effect upon its contour and progress.

    The grits, with some associated slaty bands, forming a ridge near
Old Radnor wore considered by Sir Roderick Murchison to be May

Woolhope Limestone, dipping westward, is crowded with rounded
and angular fragments of grit bearing a general resemblance to the

grits is much obscured by crushing, and the rock is sometimes
brecciated. Descriptions of microscopic sections of tho rock are
given in the paper and the specimens are grits, the materials of which
are mainl)' derived from gneissic and igneous rocks. The uncon
formity of the grits to the Woolhope Limestone Series, and the dis
similarity of the grits to the May Hill Sandstones of Presteign are
the chief facts relied upon by the author to establish the pre-
Cambrian age of the Old Radnor Series ; while the occurrence of
the rocks on the strike of the Longmynd, their position with regard
to the prolongation of the Church Stretton Fault, and their relations
to the Ordovician and Silurian rocks of the area, are in favour of a
comparison with the Longmyndian rocks. The lithological resem
blances between the Old Radnor Series and the typical Longmyndian
are very well marked. Neither the rocks of the Old Radnor Series
nor those of the Woolhope Series are affected by any metamorphic
change.
    The grits and shaly beds of Huntley are unlike the May Hill
 Sandstones of that district, and as they occur along the axis of the
 anticline, and lithologically resemble the rocks of the Longmynd, it
 is highly probable that they also are of Longmyndian age.

 F.G.S.
    The term ' Red Crag,' including, as it does, beds differing con
 siderably in age, is vague, and, when we attempt to correlate the
 East Anglian deposits with those of other countries, inconvenient ;
 the Scaldisian zone of Belgium, for example, with its southern
  fauna, representing one part of it, and the Amsteliau of Holland,
  in which Arctic shells are common, another. While retaining the
  name for general use, therefore, the following more definite classi
  fication of its various horizons, and of those of the English Pliocene
  generally, is proposed (see p. 354).
     The line separating the Older and Newer Pliocene is now drawn
  by the author between the Lenham Beds, containing Area diluvii
  and other characteristic Miocene species of the North Sea (or of the
  Italian Pliocene), and the Coralline Crag, the latter being considered
  as the oldest member of a more or less continuous and closely con
  nected series of Newer Pliocene age. The palreontological difference
  between the Coralline and Walton Crags is shown to be less than
  has hitherto been supposed.
     The upper Crag-deposits arrange themselves in horizontal and
  not in vertical sequence, assuming always a more boreal and more
 recent character as they are traced from south to north. They are

at intervals, in a northerly direction.
    A new horizon of the Crag, represented by some beds at Little
Oakley, between Walton and Harwich, is described, indicating the
period, before the southern mollusca had commenced to disappear,
when a few boreal species were beginning to establish themselves in
greater or less abundance in the Anglo-Belgian basin. Though
hitherto unnoticed, the fauna of this locality has proved to be ex
ceedingly rich, more than 350 species and varieties having been

        On the Pliocene Deposit* of the East of England.           355
there obtained, from a seam 10 yards long and less than 2 feet in
average thickness.
   The three divisions of the Red Crag now proposed (the exact
position of the Bentley bed not having been ascertained at present),
namely, Waltonian, Newbournian, and Butleyan, are distinguished
alike by the difference of their faunas, and by the position which
they occupy. The first, with its southern shells, is confined to the
county of Essex ; the second, containing a smaller proportion of
southern and extinct, and a larger proportion of northern and
recent species, occupies the district between the Orwell and Deben,
and a narrow belt of land to the east of the latter river ; the third,
in which Arctic forms such as Cardium groenlandicum are common,
is found only farther north and east. All these beds are believed
to have originated in shallow and land-locked bays, successively
occupied by the Red Crag sea as it retreated northward, which were
silted up, one after the other, with shelly sand.
   The Norwich Crag (Icenian) occupies an area entirely distinct
from that of the Red Crag, no instance being known where the one
overlies the other in vertical section ; the fauna of the former is,
moreover, more boreal and comparatively poor in species. The
Arctic species, Astarie borealis, is confined to the northern part, of
the Icenian area ; its introduction seems to mark a stage in the
continued northerly retreat of the sea. The Icenian deposits thicken
rapidly northward and eastward, and are believed by the author
 to constitute part of the great delta-formation of the Rhine.
   The mammalian remains found at the base of the different
horizons of the Crag in a remanie bed, containing material derived
from various sources, are considered to be also derivative from
deposits, older than the Coralline Crag, formerly existing to the
south.
    TheChillesfordian (estuarine), and Weybournian (marine) deposits,
 the latter characterized by the sudden appearance in the Crag basin,
 in prodigious abundance, of Ttllina halihica, represent separate
 stages in the continued refrigeration of East Anglia during the
 Pliocene period ; but the so-called ' Forest-bed' or Cromerian (fresh
 water and estuarine) with its southern mammalia, and its flora,
 similar to that of Norfolk at the present day, clearly indicates a
 return to more temperate conditions, and should therefore be sepa
 rated alike from the Weybourn Crag on the one hand, and from the
 Leda-myalis Sands and tne Arctic freshwater-bed of Mr. Clement
 Reid on the other. The two latter seem naturally to group them
 selves together, and with the Glacial deposits.
    The conditions under which the Red-Crag beds originated seem
 to exist at the present day in Holland, where sandy material
 brought down by rivers, with dead shells in great abundance from
 the adjacent sea, is being thrown against and Npon the coast, prin
 cipally by means of the westerly winds now prevalent. From meteo
 rological considerations, it seems probable that strong gales from
 the east may have prevailed over the Crag area during the latter
 pirt of the 1'liocene epoch. No other explanation of the accumu

 lation of such vast quantities of dead shells on the East Anglian
 margin of the North Sea at that period can be suggested. At the
present day, the eastern shores of Norfolk and Suffolk are almost
 destitnte of such debris.
    Mr. J. Lomas, in his Report on the Inorganic Constituents of
the Crag, states that lithologically the various subdivisions of the Red
Crag are the same. Differences of colour may be traced to definite
lines of flow along which water containing ferruginous matter has
moved.
    Among the rarer minerals separated out by high-density fluids,
zircon, rutile, cyanite, ilmenite with leucoxene, garnets, andalusife,
corundum, tourmaline, muscovite, biotite, gluuconitc, orthoclase,
labradoritc, albite, and microcline are found. In the heavy fractions
red garnets are very common. Tourmaline occurs abundantly, and
includes green, blue, yellow, and brown varieties. Muscovite pre
dominates over biotite, and often includes rounded crystals of
zircon, rutile, etc. Ferro-magnesinn minerals, with the exception
of biotite, are absent. Glauconite is very plentiful, and frequently
retains the form of the organisms of which it has formed casts.
    In the Norwich Crag the same minerals are present, but musco
vite is found in exces3. The Chillesford Sands differ from the Crags
only in the absence of glauconite. The bulk of the material of the
beds described consists of well-rounded grains of quartz, seldom
showing traces of secondary crystallization. Flint occurs as large
pebbles, and fine angular chips are met with in the sands.
   2. ' A Description of the Salt-Lake of Larnaca in the Island of
Cyprus.' By C. V. Bellamy, Esq., F.G.S., Assoc.M.Inst.C.E.
   After a brief description of the general geology and geography of
the island, the author proceeds to deal with the topography of the
Lake, which occursiri a basin shut off from the sea, its deepest part
being about 10 feet, below sea-level. The barrier between the salt-
lake and the sea is made of stiff calcareous clay associated with
massos of conglomerate resting on plastic clay, that on watery mud,
and that again on stiff calcareous clay. The sea-water appears to
percolate through the highest deposits, meeting with checks in the
conglomerates, and thus reaches the basin somewhat slowly, where
it is evaporated to dryness by tho summer heat and deposits its salt.
Artificial channels have been made, to carry the flood-water from the
land direct to the sea, so that it does not dilute the brine of the
lake. The rainfall in the catchment-area round the lake is at
the most only enough to supply 223 million gallons, and as the lake
contains 480 million gallons when full, the balance of 257 million
gallons must be derived from the sea. The lake is probably situated
on what was an extensive arm of the sea at the close of the
Kai lio/.i 'ic era. The salt-harvest begins in August, at the zenith of
summer heat, and it is reported that a single heavy shower at that
time of year suffices to ruin it. Observations are given on the
density of the water, the plants and animals in the water, and the
lake-shore .deposits. .         , . . . 1 ,         * ; .'.

358       Dr. LWt<n and Mr. Lownds on Rejfexion and
 densers of various sizes; but no attempt was made to give a
 complete theory of tbe various phenomena involved, and by
 careful quantitative observations compare experiment with
 theory. This fuller examination one of us, who followed
 von Geitler under the late Professor Hertz, at Bonn, deter
 mined to attempt when opportunity offered. The present
 paper embodies the result of the work carried out during the
 session 1898-5)9 at University College, Nottingham, and
 advances the problem another stage towards complete solution.
    2. The phenomena are more complic.-ited than might be at
first supposed. This is chiefly owing to the fact that the
wave train, reflected by the condenser under examination,
passes and repasses between the point of reflexion and the
oscillator at the beginning of the line. Hence the effect to
be observed, owing to reflexion at any condenser, is' a
function not only of the coefficient of that reflexion but also
of the other constants of the circuit. To avoid unnecessary
complication, the wave- train transmitted by tbe condenser is
always completely absorbed by a suitable bridge at the end
of the line.
   3. By placing the electrometer beyond the condenser, the
wave-train transmitted is determined, and by placing the
condenser far beyond tbe electrometer the wave-train re
flected is measured. In order to determine the phase-lag
introduced in the reflected wave-train, the condenser is
placed in a number of positions, each of which is onlv a
short distance beyond the electrometer. We thus obtain
stationary waves by the interference of tbe incident and
reflected wave-trains, and these, explored by the electrometer,
exhibit the phase-change sought. To bring this change of
Chase into clearer relief, stationary waves are also obtained
  y a resistance-bridge, whose reflexion coefficient is the same
as that of the condenser, but whose phase-change is it
simply.
   4 The results obtained with the three condensers used are
all in fair accord with theory, both as to phase-lag and
coefficient of reflexion and transmission. The experimental
discrepancy, if such it can be called, is in the direction of
less reflected and less transmitted than the long-wave theory
predicts.
   Jt may be mentioned here that the experiments, though
given in this paper after the theory, were in practice finished
before the theory was fully worked out. The experimental
results are thus free from any bias due to anticipation based
on theory. Each set of readings was accepted simply on the

             Transmission of Electric Waves along Wires.               359
   ground of consistency of the separate readings. Further,
   the experimental curves were in all cases plotted before
   superposition of the theoretical ones.
                    Experimental Arrangements.
     5. The arrangement of the apparatus adopted for observing
  the reflected wave-trains is diagram matically represented in
  fig. 1. In this figure, A denotes the battery of two storage-
     Fig. ].— Circuit arranged for Reflected System and for Interference
                                Phenomena.
                                                    t       D            T
 cells, B and C are the primary and secondary coils respect
 ively of the induction-coil, of which (J has a resistance of
 3000 ohms and an inductance of about 20 henries. G is the
 spark-gap, which was adjusted to 2 mm., the balls being of
 brass, highly polished before each occasion of experimenting.
 The wire PGP', measured along the semicircle, is about
 2 metres long. PP' are the edge-views of the condenser-
 plates of zinc 40 cm. diameter placed opposite to and 30 cm.
 distent from the precisely similar disks S S'.
    6. The line is represented by SEDTT'D'E'S', and consists
 of two parallel copper wires, 1'5 mm. diam., and kept 8 cm.
apart by wood separators at intervals of about 1 metre. These
 wood separators are about 12 cm. long, 2'5 cm. wide, and
 1*2 cm. thick, and were well saturated before use in melting
 paraffin-wax. Their resistance was thus raised to something
 over 60,000 megohms each, which thus renders the leakage
of the line quite negligible.
    7. EE' denotes the electrometer, which has a single plane
needle initially uncharged, and suspended by a fine quartz
fibre between two disks attached to the line at E and E'.
The needle is therefore electrified by induction whenever a
wave-train passes EE',and its ends are consequently attracted
to the disks whatever the sign of their potential-difference.
The first throw of the electrometer is thus proportional to
the time-integral of the square of the potential-difference.
The needle is provided with weak magnetic control and a
plane mirror by Adam Hilger, its indications being read by

360       Dr. Barton and Mr. Lownds on liifiejc'wn and
a distant telescope and scale. The induction-coil is put on
end to avoid any magnetic effect on the electrometer-needle.
The leads also of the coil sire kept close together, and, before
taking a set of readings, the electrometer is tested as to the
adequacy of these precautious against possible disturbance.
The disks and the ends of the needle are each about 2 cm.
diam. and 1 cm. apart. It will be shown later that the
reflexion of waves at the electrometer, regarded as a con
denser on the line, is extremely small and quite negligible.
    8. TT' denotes the terminal bridge which is used to absorb
the waves on arrival at the end of the line. It consists of
graphite markings on a disk of ground glass, 3 inches
diameter, and before each set of readings is adjusted to the
resistance which corresponds to complete absorption ; namely,
for the line in question, 560 ohms *.
    DD' denotes one of the condensers in use to reflect the
waves. For the transmitted system they are removed from
 DD' and inserted at FF'. They were all three made of
disks of zinc 1 cm. apart, their radii being respectively 15,
 9, and 5 cm. The two disks were kept at the right distance
apart, and insulated by pieces of wood saturated in paraffin-
wax, notched and secured with shellac.
    9. The total length of the line from S to T is of the order
 166 metres. The distance SE is 116 metres, 8F is of the
 order 60 metres.         ED varies from about "75 metre to
 50 metres. Exact details will be given in connexion with
 the various experiments.
    10. The waves generated by the primary oscillator are of
 the damped simple harmonic type 8'5 metres long, their
 logarithmic decrement per wave being 0"6. Thus the wave-
 train launched upon and propagated along the line with the
 speed of light is a damped train with its large end or head
 leading, the tail, after about 10 or 12 waves, being almost
 negligible. As the waves proceed along the line they suffer
 attenuation, also some loss on reflexion at the oscillator.
 The constants expressing these effects were previously deter
 mined experimentally on the line now in use, and their
 numerical values will be introduced into the theory later.
                                Theory.
     11. Preliminary.—The plan adopted throughout the ex
  periments is to take (1) readings of the electrometer with no
 condenser on the line, but only the absorbing-bridge at the

    end; alternated with (2) electrometer-readings with a con
    denser on the line at an intermediate position, as well as the
    absorbing-bridge at the end. The mean ratio of the readings
   under the different conditions constitutes the experimental
   estimate of the effect produced by the condenser in question
   when in that position.
       12. In order, however, to interpret the experimental results
   and compare them with theory, we need to trace the history
   of the wave-train reflected by the condenser until it is,
   practically, extinguished by its losses through repeated re
   flexion and attenuation. The effect at the electrometer when
   no condenser is on the line may be represented by a single
   time-integral which, without sensible error, owing to the
  damping of the wave-train, may be taken from the com
  mencement of the time to infinity. The effect at the
  electrometer when a condenser is on the line requires, how
  ever, an infinite series of integrals.
      13. To construct this series we must first determine the
  various elements of which it consists. " We must accordingly
  treat the case of a condenser on the line, not at the end. This
 will be referred to as an intermediate condenser. We have
 here to determine the coefficients of reflexion and transmission
 and the phase-lags of both the reflected and transmitted
 portions. The c;ise of a terminal condenser must also be
 treated, since the oscillator at the beginning of the line falls
 under this category. Here, only two constants are required,
 the amplitude and phase of the reflected portion. These
 points will now be dealt with in order, together with subsidiary
 matters that crop up by the way and arc included for the sake
of completeness.
     14. We shall treat the circuit throughout as what Mr.
 Oliver Heaviside terms a " distortionless circuit," not that it is
 strictly distortionless, but because it is very nearly so ; and this
treatment, while sacrificing nothing of material accuracy,
considerably simplifies the analys-is. Prof. W. B. Morton*
has shown that for the circuit in question the errors thus
involved are less than one in a thousand.
     15. Intermediate Condenser.—At the place of attachment
of the condenser let <px denote the potential-difference of the
two wires of the line due to the arrival there of the incident
wave-train. Then <f>i is a function of the time. Similarly
let <f>' and <f)3 correspond to the reflected and transmitted
wave-trains respectively. Then by consideration of potential
and Heaviside's theory of the distortionless circuit, assumed

                                                                  (1)
               Q = </>, = 0 for t = 0;
  where Q is the quantity of electricity at time t on the positively
  charged plate of the condenser of capacity S' (in electro
  magnetic units), and the i's denote the currents in the positive
  wires due to the wave-trains denoted by the <f>'s bearing the
  same subscript or dash; L denotes the inductance of the line
  per unit-length, and v is the speed of free jether radiation.
  .These equations were used by Heaviside with reference
  primarily to waves of telephonic frequency, but are here
  adopted as a working approximation for the phenomena which
  obtain in the case of Hertzian waves.
     On eliminating the *'s and Q, we have
                 (L,S^ + 2y=-L,S'|^,                   .  .  .   w
 and
                 (LrS'|+2)^ = 2^                                 (3)
 These expressions might have been written at once from
 Heavisido's operational results, the reflexion and transmission
 coefficients for an intermediate bridge being respectively
                        -Lr                 2Z
                      2Z+Lv and 2ZTU                             W
where the resistance operator Z is here equivalent to
                               csr
since the bridge is a condenser merely.
    16. Now if the incident wave-train is a damped sine
function right up to its head, we may write without loss of
generality,
                        <£t = «-**•< cos (p< + t)               (5)
Substituting this value of fa in equations (2) and (3) and
satisfying the initial conditions expressed in (1), we obtain in
the usual way the following solutions :—

The algebraic signs of a, a', b, and b' being preserved show in
 which quadrants a and 0 should be taken.
   17. We see from (6) and (7) that the reflected and trans
mitted wave-trains consist each of a damped periodic part and
a purely exponential part. The exponential part we shall
have to omit from the first portion of the subsequent analysis,
because we have no experimental proof of the exact shape of
the head of the incident wave-train. For the same reason
we shall at first omit the i also. The greatest correction
which this approximate theory can in any possible case
require will be subsequently discussed and evaluated, (bee
arts. 60 and 61.)
   18. Under these simplifications we may compactly repre
sent the three wave-trains as follows :—
Incident wave-train, real part of *>(• —*)c*>
Reflected wave-train, real part of (a + a'i)e('— *)?',     V (10)
Transmitted wave-train, real part of (6+6'/)t<*-*)p';
where a, a', b and b' have the values assigned to them in (8)
and have been confirmed by Heaviside's operational methods.
   19. It may be noted in passing that if the incident wave-
train were not damped, the reflected and transmitted trains
would differ in phase by ,j exactly.        For on putting k = Q
in the expressions for tan a and tan /3 they become
—2        — v'
     ,and —j*"- respectively, hence their product is t-1. This

364       Dr. Barton a>ul Mr. Lownds on Reflexion and
simple relation is seen to be slightly modified by the
damping.
   Again, if the damping were not present, we should have
the simple result A* + Ba=l, as should be the ca*e, showing
that the sum of the energies of the reflected and transmitted
wave-trains equals the energy of the incident one. To
effect the corresponding check for the damped waves, one
would need to take the time-integrals from zero to infinity
of the square of the amplitude tor the incident, reflected,
and transmitted wave-trains, the exponential terms being no
longer ignored.
    As a further check it may he noted that the equation for
potential-difference at the condenser is always satisfied. For
the equation in question, viz.: fa -f fa = fa, reduces to
l+a = h and b' = a', and by (8) this is an identity for all
values of k and ¦%'.
    20. If the capacity of the condenser be imagined to in
crease from zero to infinity, while the circuit and the incident
wave-train are maintained the same, we see by equations
(15) and (8) that the reflexion-coefficient A grows from zero

           22. Reflexion at Electrometer negligible.— It is now
        necessary to inquire whether the electrometer reflects any
        appreciable part of the wave-train incident upon it. As
        previously mentioned, this is not the case.
           Between the disks attached to the line at EE' (fig. 1) the
        ends of the needle are interposed, each disk with its adjacent
        needle-end forming a condenser whose plates are 1 centim.
        radius and 1 centim. apart. The electrometer as a whole
        constitutes a set of two such condensers in series. Hence
        the capacity interposed between E and E' is half that due to
        one disk and needle-end.
           Taking the correction for the edges of the plates in a
        parallel disk condenser given in Kohlrausch's ' Practical
        Physics,' we thus obtain S', the capacity between E and E',
        equals £ x 10~21 in electromagnetic C.G.s. units. And for the

          Transmission of Electric Waves along Wives.       367
present experimental case, Lt> = 56 x 10'° and p = 2xl08 in
the same units.       Hence x'=LwS/;' = ,037, a=— 00035,
a'=--01S', and A* = a2 + a'2 =00036.
   Thus the energy reflected by the electrometer is of tho
order 004 per cent, of that incident upon it, and is therefore
quite negligible.
   23. Intermediate Resistance.—It seems desirable for the
purpose of contrast with the reflexion from a condenser to
consider now that of au intermediate resistance. In this case
the phase-change iutroduced does not vary with the amplitude
coefficient. But, however the resistance is varied, the phase-
change introduced in the reflected wave-train remains con
stant and equal to a lag of ir.
   24. Thus, using the same notation as before, we have the
following equations as the conditions connecting potential-
difference and current where a bridge of resistance R' is
Elaced on the line, the line being understood to extend
  eyond it.
                                 »', = <f>,/Li>,
                                 «'=-<£7L«.
                       ii + i'-it^^/W.
Whence, on elimination of the i"s, we obtain
             £_^^L              and hm. 2K'
             4>1~21i' + Lt>               ch~2Li'+Lt'"
   25. Or, we may say that if the incident wave-train be
a cosine function of the time, damped or not, the reflexion-
coefficiont and phase-change are respectively
                A-2TOT»'             and      *'*"*¦    ¦ • (11)
Similarly, the amplitude-coefficient and phase-change for the
transmitted wave-train are seen to be respectively
                  B'=2TOTy'            and       *-°- • • • <12>

denser at the end of the line be S0, the previous notation for
incident and reflected waves &c. being retained. We then

     Or, if we ignore, as before, the exponential term and let
the incident wave-train be the real part of ei'-^1, then the

the c's having the values given in equations (15).
     In the case of a terminal condenser we see that if k = 0,
0=1 for all values of ^0. This simple relation is slightly
disturbed by the damping when present.
     28. This theory of the terminal condenser has been given
for the sake of dealing with the reflexion which occurs at the
oscillator at the beginning of the line. It may be approxi
mately treated as a condenser simply, because the interval
elapsing between the launching of the wave-train along tho
line and its return after traversing about 300 metres is so
                                                                               A

   29. Electrometer-throw for Single Passage of Wave-train. —
It might at first be supposed that the phase at the head of a
wave-train would have no effect on the electrometer-throw,
except when that wave-train was interfering with another,
and so producing stationary waves in the neighbourhood of
the electrometer. This, however, is not the ca-e. On the
contrary, the throw produced by the passage of a single
wave-train of given amplitude, period, and damping depends
to some exteut on the initial phase. Thus we have
                i . + .)]
      r v , cos (pt
      [e-"»'                              2t + A2(l

                                                                 (17)
J  Hence, although we have hitherto been compelled, in one
or two cases, to sacrifice rigour on minor points on account
of insufficient data, the initial phase of a wave-train will
hereafter always be taken account of when dealing with
reflexions for which theory furnishes the value of the phase-
change to be expected.
    It may be seen from (17) that where k — 0'\ the value of
 the integral varies with t between limits having the ratio
 11 to 9 approximately.
    30. Transmitted System.— Let the condenser under exam
ination be at a point on the line distant / cm. from its
 beginning at the oscillator, and let the electrometer be /2 cm.
 beyond the condenser, i.e. l + l2 from the beginning of the
 line. Take the origin of coordinates at the condenser, and
 let the potential-difference of the wires due to the incident
 wave-train be represented by <f>u where
                  ^1 = e-*p(<—xlv)-ax Cos p(t—x/v). . . (18)
    The a here provides for the attenuation of the waves in
 their passage along the line. Its value has been previously
 determined experimentally.
    The train incident at the condenser is accordingly
                            £,=e-*p< cos pt                      (19)
    31. Now, owing to the irregularity of the sparks at the
 primary oscillator, it is necessary in the experimental exami
 nation of an}- condenser to alternate electrometer-readings
 with and without the condenser on the line ; the bridge
 which absorbs all waves incident upon it being throughout in
 place at the end of the line.

 370      Dr. Barton and Mr. Lownds on Reflexion and
    We have therefore to determine theoretically the ratio v, of
 the mean reading d' with the condenser on the line, to the
 mean reading d with no condenser on. Now the electrometer-
throw, as previously explained, is proportional to the time-
integral of the square of the amplitude of the wave-train
passing it. Hence, denoting by E the electrometer-constant,
we have
          Ed=e-2d, ( " *-*fc(<-*/>»)oos«/>(t-J|A>>tt

   32. Consider now the throw d' obtained with the con
denser on the line. Retaining the previous notation for the
transmission and reflexion operators of the condensers we
have for the wave-trains successively transmitted at the
condenser the following series :—
   First wave-train: B«-*P< cos (pt + fi),                      .
   Second do.          CABe-M-*' cos(/>< + 7 + « + #),           I
   Third     do.       C»AiBe-*/><-^oos(><+2y + 2a + /9). j (' '
   The formation of this series is easily traced by noting that
each time a wave-train is incident upon the condenser, not
only is a part transmitted but also a part is reflected, suffers
attenuation along the line in its passage to the oscillator, is
there reflected, and again suffers attenuation along the line
before reaching the condenser a second time. These effects
are all provided for in the above series, in which also the
simplification is adopted of taking t = 0 for each new arrival
of a wave-train at the condenser.
   33. We thus have, on taking the time-integrals of the
squares of the successive trains, the following series: —
           Ed'e*>h = B* j       e- **?* cos8 (pt + &)dt
               + iJBM e-rtpt cos2 (i>t + /3 + K)dt
              +           +              +                   (22)
where rmi)Ae~"* and K = a + y.

Further, the series, to which (22) when integrated gives
rise, are represented by

                       _ sin <f> — r'sin <£ — ^r

                             1 — 2r* cos ijr + r'
   Hence (22) is easily trans-formed to
      4kp(l + k*)Ed'e*">
           = B* { iZTr* ~ D (sin 2^-r* sin 2J9— 2*)
              + j^g + p (cos 2/9- r» cos 2£^2i) j ;        . (25)
where D = 1 — 2r* cos 2/c + r4.
   34. Now in the experimental case under consideration k is
less than 0" 1 ; we may therefore, for the order of accuracy
aimed at, simplify by neglect of k*. Then dividing (25) by
(20) gives
    y= d = B* 1 I^S " D (sin ^-** sin *£-2*) J ; . (26)
which is the working formula for comparison with the
experimental results.
   35. Regarding this expression physically, we may note
that its essence is the factor B4, the square of the amplitude
transmitted. The denominator 1 — r* of the first term in the
brackets is due to the repeated coursings of the waves to
and fro between the condenser and oscillator. Finally, the
second term, which vanishes with k, or with /8 and k, is a
small correction whose existence is due to the fact that with
a damped wave-train the electrometer-throw varies slightly
with the phase at the head, as shown in Art. 29.
   36. Stationary Waves at Electrometer.—Now suppose the
electrometer to be at a point on the line distant /2 cm. from
its beginning at the oscillator, and let the condenser be at
^ + ^ = 1 cm. from the beginning, i. e. l3 cm. beyond the
electrometer. This disposition is exhibited in fig. 1. Let
the absorbing bridge be at the end of the line as before.
Take the origin of coordinates at the electrometer, and let the

incident wave-train be represented by

dealt with, the wave-train first reflected at the condenser
returns along the wires, suffering attenuation during its
transit, is reflected at the oscillator, and is again attenuated
in passing along the line to the electrometer. This second
wave-train produces a second interference phenomenon, like
that due to the initial wave already treated; but phase changes

          dently, then, to complete the account of what happens at the

          each of the three types given in (31) as due to the first
          interference effect.
             40. All these integrals, when evaluated, have the same
          denominator ; hence bringing that to the left side of the
          equation, we may write

          and the 93 me applies to G and H.
             41. In constructing the integrals for the first line, we have
          to note that the reflexion at the condenser and the return of
          the waves to the electrometer introduce the space coordinate
          2Z.in two exponential factors and in the argument of the
          cosine, besides introducing the amplitude factor A and the
          phase change a.
             Again, in passing down any one of the columns in (32) we
          have to affect each succeeding line by the factor rq, and intro

    43. Discussion of Interference Phenomena.— Let us now
 consider the various features of this result and their physical
 interpretation. In equations (36) to (38) the values of F, G,
 and H are arranged in terms commencing with one of the
 order unity and proceeding by ascending powers of k. The
 terms involving k are all small as their coefficients are of the
 order unity, and k is less than O'l in the experimental case
  under examination. Those involving k* will be omitted
 finally as their coefficients are likewise of the order unity.
     The presence of the terms in k is due to the fact, already
  discussed in art. 29, that the electrometer-throw is slightly
  affected by the phase at the head of a wave-train of given
  amplitude, period, and damping. They are therefore but
  small corrections to the main features of the case which are
  represented by the first terms only of each of the expressions
  in (36) to (38) for F, G, and H. The denominators of these
  terms supply the correction for the successive arrivals at the
  electrometer of wave-trains which have suffered reflexion at

             Transmission of Electric Waves along Wires.      375
 the condenser and oscillator and passed to and fro along
 the line.
    44. Let curves be imagined with Z2, the distance between
 electrometer and condenser, as abscissae, and F, G, and H as
 ordinates. It is then seen by inspection of (36) that the curve
 for P is practically a straight line parallel to the axis of
 abscissas. This was to be expected on physical grounds, for
 it represents the effect at the electrometer due to all the
 positively-travelling waves. And they are almost independent
 of any change in the value of /2 when that change is small
 compared with llm
    45. Similarly, on inspection of (37), we see that, apart
 from the small terms in k and the slight change of r with l2,
 the curve for G is a logarithmically drooping one. But the
 droop is very slight for .?4 = A*e-4'a(r. This again is what
 might be expected from physical considerations, since this
 term, G, is due to the return of the wave-train reflected at
 the condenser apart from interference effects.
    4(>. Turning finally to equation (38), we see that the main
features of H are those represented by the first term. This
term consists essentially of two factors, one exponential and
the other trigonometrical. The exponential factor here gives
a much quicker droop than that in G, for we now have se~M
instead of «* simply as before.
    47. The essential nature of H will be made clearer if we
write the chief parts of its first term in full. Thus
                2Ae -2*y^" cos (-^ -<*) = /< (say).    .  . (39)
Let now a curve be plotted with h as ordinates and l3 as
abscissce, and call this the interference curve, since it repre
sents the essential features of the electrometer-throws due to
interference of waves reflected by the condenser with those
incident upon it. Then by inspection of (39) and comparison
with equation (27), representing the incident wave-train, we
have the following results : —
   (1) The interference curve is of damped wave-form.
    (2) The wave-length of the interference curve is half that
         of the incident wave-train.
    (3) The logarithmic decrement per wave of the interference
         curve is equal to that of the incident wave-train.
   (4) The amplitude of the interference curve is double the
         amplitude factor introduced by the condenser on
         reflexion.
   (5) The phase change exhibited in the interference curve
         compared with the incident wave-train is equal in
         magnitude but opposite in sign to that introduced by
         the condenser on reflexion.

376        Dr. Barton and Mr. Lownds on Reflexion and
    48. It may be noted here also in corroboration of these
results that, if we simplify to the case of a resistance-bridge
of resistance infinity or zero and omit all small terms and
corrections, we obtain Bjerknes' expression for interference*.
    Thus taking only the first terms of F, G, and H, omitting
their denominators and the factor e~ '*a, and writing A = l,
and a=0 or 7r, we have
                  F + G + H = 2(1 ±e~H cos 0),                  (40)
which is equivalent to Bjerknes' equation just quoted.
    49. If we now simplify equations (35) to (38) by neglect of
k9 and divide by the corresponding equation (30), we obtain
                     y=j=F + G+U,

     This is the general formula to the desired degree of
 accuracy.
     50. Reflected System.—In order to realize an experimental
 arrangement by which the value of A, the amplitude factor
 on reflexion at the condenser, may be inferred as simply as
 possible, let l2 be taken very large. The term H is then
 practically extinguished by its very small exponential factor.
 But, lest its value should still be appreciable, let two values
 of l3 be used, viz. : /s + X/8 and /a— X/8, where X is the
 wave-length of the incident waves. These values of lt will
 give to H opposite algebraical signs, and since H is here
 very small the difference between its values for each position
 will be quite negligible. Moreover the values of F and G
 are almost the same for /s + X/8 and /3 — X/8. We may,
 accordingly, write as the working formula for the reflected
 system,
                          meany = F + G,                         (42)

 mean of the ratios j obtained with l3 + X/8 and /2— X/8, and
 F and G may be calculated from (41) as for /g simply.
    51. Detection of Phase Change of Reflected Waves.—We
 have just noticed a method of practically extinguishing H
 to simplify the determination of A. Now to determine the
 phase change, a, we must take exactly the opposite course and
 make H paramount, since this term represents the interference
 phenomena which alone involve a except in a subordinate
 degree.
     We therefore choose a number of values of lt differing by
 small amounts and ranging from zero to about two wave
 lengths of the interference curve.
    Since in these cases /2 is very small compared with /t (say
0 to 10 metres and 100 metres respectively), the variable
 1 = 1^ f l2 may be put equal to the constant lx without material
 loss of accuracy. Consequently r is replaced by t\ and D
 becomes D,.
    52. We thus obtain from (41), under these simplifications,
our interference formula, viz. : —
                       g=i = F + G-I-H,

    53. A further simplification is made in the nctual calcula
tion and plotting of the theoretical curve, by writing

                 H=              (1 + n) cos(0-a + v).       (44)

The small quantities n and v are defined as functions of k, »•,,
and * by the identity of these two expressions for H. Both
n and "v vanish for k = 0, and assume a simplified value for
* = 0. The actual values of n and v in any numerical case
can be readily found with sufficient accuracy by the graphical
composition of sine and cosine functions, the amplitudes being
represented by the lengths of lines whose inclination denotes
the relative phase of the respective vibrations.

   55. Positions of Condensers.— For the transmitted system
the condensers were placed at FF' (fig. 1), the distance SF
being 5i) metres + X/8. These lu-o distances were chosen to
eliminate any error which would arise if interference occurred
on the oscillator side of the condenser. This might con
ceivably take place between the head of a wave-train arriving
at the condenser simultaneously with the departure of the tail
of a previous train reflected there. To reduce this anticipated
disturbance to a minimum, the distance SF was chosen of the
order CO m. in preference to any smaller distance. It is
easily seen that if this interference was additive in one of the
positions chosen, then it would be subtractive in the other,
and both being small the arithmetic mean could be taken.
From the tables of readings it may be noted that neither of
these precautions was unnecessary.
   56. In the reflected system the distance ED of the con
denser beyond the electrometer, denoted by l2 in the theory,
was made 48 m. + X/8 ; the two positions being again adopted
to obviate any error due to interference. Here again the
precautions were not in vain. The wave-length A. of the

           Transmission of Electric Waves along Wires.        379
incident waves was determined by Bjerknes's method to be
8*5 m.
   For the interference phenomena, observed in order to
detect the phase change on reflexion, the distance ED was
varied by half a metre from 0*75 m. to about 8*0 m. so as
to furnish nearly two wave-lengths of the interference
curve.
   The methods of taking the readings and their results will
be sufficiently understood from the following tables and
accompanying curves. The three condensers used were
chosen by reference to the curve in fig. 5 as likely to yield
typical results.

   With such small readings as those here obtained for d' it
cannot be professed that they are free from errors due to
small variations of the zero, which is never quite steady and
is always read before each throw is taken throughout all the
experimental work.

time the zero crept 22 scale-divisions in the positive direction, viz., from —32
to -10.
    Since the amplitude factor of the wave-train reflected from
this condenser is almost unity, a bridge of no-resistance,
whose reflexion factor is exactly unity, was used as a com
parison and to show the phase-difference between the two
curves. Three sets of readings were taken with this bridge,
the points and mean curve for which are plotted on fig. 7.

 390       Dr. Barton and Mr. Lownds on Reflexion and
    61. It is seen on reference to Table XI. that there is a
 considerable discrepancy l>etween the experimentally-deter
 mined values of the ratios of electrometer-throws and those
 calculated from the approximate theory. This theory, used
as a first working approximation, takes t = 0 in the original
 incident wave-train e—kpt cos (pt + i), and omits the expo
 nential term introduced on reflexion at the condenser. This
 was done because the value of « is unknown. Let us now
 determine the maximum correction needed to the above
 theory, the results of which are placed in the last column of
 Table XI. Assume for i such values as to make for each
 condenser i + /9 = 0. This makes the coefficient of the ex
 ponential term a maximum. Further, let us suppose (what
 is not possible) that the coefficient of the exponential term
 retains its maximum value all through; i.e., put t + /8 + 2*=0
or it, i + /8 + -i*=0 or iir &c. for the successive reflexions and
transmissions. In order to convert the time-integral of the
square of the amplitude, on the approximate theory, to its
true value when the exponential term is retained, let As and
 Bs be now replaced by pA' and tW respectively.
    Then we shall have
                                                                \

    Further, since i has now a finite value, and different for

the introduction of i. We thus obtain the following cor
rected equations: —

    62. It is to be noted that these formulae in two respects
over-correct the original approximate expressions. First, they
assume that the trigonometrical coefficient of the exponential
term is a maximum for every successive incidence; and second,
they assume that for each condenser t+/3 = 0, which necessi
tates a different t for each case, whereas the wave-train
launched along the line must have the same shaped head in
each case. Thus the truth on the long-wave theory may be
expected to lie between the values given in the first and third
columns of Table XI.
   (53. In comparing the experimental values with the theory,
the following points may be noted :—
   (1) In one case (in Table XI.) experiment and theory give
       identical values (last line).
   (2) In two cases the theory seems over-corrected (lines
       1&5).
  (3) In three cases the correction to the theory fails to bring
      the values down to those experimentally determined.
  (4) Hence the outstanding discrepancy is on the side of
      slightly less reflected and les-s transmitted than theory
      predicts, though further experiments under a greater
      variety of conditions would be needed to establish this
      view of the case.
  (5) Turning now from the question of the amplitudes of
      the reflected and transmitted waves to that of tin? phase-
     change, a, introduced on reflexion, we see from tigs. 9,
      10, & 11 that the theoretical and experimental results
     are in fair agreement.

       XXXVII. On the Tabulation of certain Freijuency-
     Distributions. By W. F. Sheppard, M.A., LL.M*
 1. VVJ'HEN' a measure X varies continuously, but with
      * » varying frequency, between limits X0 and X„ (either
 or both of which may be at an infinite distance from the zero
 of the scale), the usual method of presenting the relative
 frequencies is to divide the whole range X, — X0 into equal
 intervals h, and to tabulate tbe number of cases in which X
 falls within each of the divisions of the scale so formed.
 When a large number of cases has been thus tabulated, the
 entries in the table are taken to represent the successive areas
 into which the figure of frequency is divided by a series of
 equidistant ordinates.
    To decide whether the curve of frequency can be repre
 sented by an equation of a particular form, the arbitrary
 constants occurring in the equation are determined by
 calculating the mean, mean square, moan cube, . . . o£ the
 values of X, i.e., by calculating the first, second, third, . . .
 moments of the figure of frequency about the ordinate corre
sponding to X = 0. In the very common cases in which
extreme variations are relatively rare, so that the curve of
 frequency has very close contact, at both extremities, with the
 base, the formula? giving the moments of the figure of fre
quency, in terms of the areas bounded by equidistant ordinates,
are very simple t- Xor is there any great difficulty in the
calculations when the figure of frequency is terminated at
either or both extremities by a finite ordinate ; the problem
then resolving itself into the quadrature of an area in terms
of a series of ordinates J. There is, however, a large number
of cases in which the figure of frequency is bounded at one
or both extremities by an ordinate which is so great in com
parison with other ordinates as to be practically infinite.
Cases of the first kind, in which only one bounding ordinate
is infinite, are especially common in economic statistics, and
it is not necessary to give an example here§. Oases of the
second kind, where both the bounding ordinates are infinite, are
less common, but they do occur. Prof. Pearson has quoted
the following as an example** : —

         Degrees of Cloudiness at Breslau, 187(5—1885.

In these cases the moments of the figure of frequency cannot
be conveniently expressed in terms of the areas bounded by
equidistant ordinate?, and some other method of tabulation
should therefore be adopted.
   2. The proper method, iu all such cases, is that which is
known as the rentile (or " percentile ") method. Instead of
dividing the range of values of X into equal portions, and
finding the corresponding areas of the figure of frequency,
the area of the figure of frequency is to be divided into equal
portions, and the corresponding values of X are to be found
and tabulated. A division into ten equal portions, giving the
" deciie " values, will usually be sufficient ; but a division into
twenty or more is better. The values of X should be found, as
far as possible, by direct observation ; interpolation being
only resorted to when the original measurements were so
rough that several values of X fall into a class containing a
particular centile.
   When both the bounding ordinates are infinite, the centile
method of classification is all that is required. When only
one bounding ordinate is infinite, both methods must be
adopted ; the moment (of any order) of the figure of frequency
must be calculated in two portions, the centile method being
applied to the portion adjoining the infinite ordinate, and the
ordinary method to the remainder.
   3. The simplest case is that in which both bounding ordi
nates are infinite. Let Z denote the ordinate of the figure of
frequency corresponding to abscissa X, the whole area of the
figure of frequency being unity. Then the with moment, is
                            ,= fX'ZX"dX                         (1)
Now let A denote the area, of the figure up to the ordinate Z.
Then we have
                            A:L=PzdX,                           (2)
and therefore
                             Z = d\/dX                          (3)
Hence, by (1),
                   Mm=rp X" . dA/dX . dX

Suppose the area to be divided into p equal portions, and let
the corresponding values of X be X0, Xh X2, . . . Xp. Then
the Euler-Maclaurin formula, applied to (4), gives
   M.= {iX» + X;» + X»+ . . . +Xpz1 + ^}/P

       +                                                      (5)
But, since the bounding ordinate* (dA/d.X )A=0 and (dA/«/X)A=i
are infinite or very great, and the area of the figure is finite,
the bounding values of the first few differential coefficients
dXm/dA,diX"lJdA'i, . . . are negligible; and we have therefore,
as an approximate formula,
        M„={iX»' + X;- + X»'+ . . . +X«_1 + *X»}/p, . (6)
by means of which the value of M« is very easily calculated.
   If we require the mean square, mean cube, ... of the de
viation from the mean, we write
                                X'=X-M„                       (7)
and we have, for the mean wth power of the deviation. from
the mean,
        M-= {iX;- + XJ- + XJ- + . . . + X';_a + iX'; \IP. (8)
   When only one bounding ordinate is infinite, we have to
apply the method to the calculation of the moments of the
area extending from this ordinate to an ordinate which may
or may not correspond to one of the centile values of X. The
mth moment of this area is then given by the integral (4),
but with a different upper (or lower) limit; and the formula
(5) has to be modified, and the terms depending on differential
coefficients have to be expressed in terms of differences.
   4. To illustrate the accuracy of the formulae (6) and (8), I
have worked out the following two cases. The range in each
case is taken to be from X=0 to X = l.

   5. Various difficulties may arise in applying the method ;
but they will usually be due to imperfections in the original
observations, rather than to defects in the method itself. The
 following special points may be noted :—
    (i.) When the observations are very accurate, but few in
number, there may be large gaps between successive values
 of X ; and there may thus be a doubt as to the exact value to
 be assigned to any particular centile. But the doubt will
 only occur, in general, near the centre of the range; and the
 inaccuracy in Mi will be subordinate to its " probable error,"
 while the inaccuracy in ft?, fi3, . . . will be very small.

                 Tabulation of certain Frequency- Distributions.            397
         (ii.) When, on the other hand, the values of X are only
     taken originally by very large intervals, there may be a good
     deal of difficulty in determining the centile values towards
     the extremities of the range. Thus, in the example given in
     § 1, the last class (cloudiness = 10) comprises more than half
     the total number of observations ; and there are no direct
     data for the subdivision of this class. All we can do in these
     cases is to apply a suitable method of interpolation. Thus,
     in the above example, if we assume that the eleven " degrees "
     correspond to equal divisions of a scale, the range will be
     from — \ to +10|. Altering this, for convenience, to a
     range 0 to 11, and smoothing the observations (which are
     obviously incorrect at the upper end of the scale), I obtain *
     the following values of X : —
o^ationl. } ° 10 20 30 40                   50       60     70    80    90      100

     From these data the " frequency-constants " are easily
      calculated by means of (6) or (8).
          (iii.) A further difficulty is often caused by ignorance of
      the exact bounding value or values of X. Prof. 1'earson has
      already called attention t to this difficulty, especially in the
      case of economic statistics : and he points out to me that in
      the above example the first class includes all cases where
     there is no cloudiness at all, as well as those in which there
     is a cloudiness of less than 5l0-) while the last class includes all
      cases of total cloudiness, which cannot be graduated. Making
      no assumption as to the values of X0 and X,, I get the following
     arrangement : —
  Pereentof i o 10 20 30 40                 50       60     70    80     90     100

  cloudiness. J
          It will be seen that, this gives a decidedly smaller range
      of values of X. The discrepancy between the two results
      illustrates the importance ot making exact observations at the
      ends of the scale.
          6. Finally, it may be observed that the adoption of this
      method of calculating the mean square, mean cube, .... does
      not affect the formulae for the probable errors in the frequency-
         * The values of X are given to three decimal places, though the data
      are not really sufficient to give them to more than two places. The
      method of smoothing and interpolation is too complicated to be explained
      here.

   XXXVIII. The Chemical and Geological History of the
     Atmosphere. By John Stevenson, M.A., F.I.C.*
                      [Continued from p. 323.]
ANOTHER line of inquiry that has some bearing on our
       subject is provided by studying the rate of growth of
vegetation. Sixty years ago Liebig made or obtained estimates
regarding the amount of dry wood produced per acre per
annum on average forest-land, of dry hay on meadow-land,
of straw and corn on arable land, and also of beetroot on
arable land. The results were very similar in all cases when
reduced to dry substance, and were nearly equivalent to
2 tons of dry wood, or dry hay, &c. per English acre per
annum.     Lord Kelvin, in his address on the Age of the
Earth, thinks this is too high an estimate to take as an average
for the whole earth—he thinks it is " much higher than the
average activity of vegetable growth on land and sea." But
if we call the average rate over the land-surface of the earth
only half of the above estimate of Liebig's, and leave the
sea out of account altogether, we shall probably not err on
the side of making too high an estimate, for though a large
proportion of the earth's surface is covered by deserts, there
are large areas in tropical regions where the luxuriance is
very much greater than that of the above estimate, and
besides there is a very considerable growth of vegetable
matter in the sea which we are leaving out of account. Let
us also suppose that the dry wood, hay, &c. contain on the
average 40 per cent, of carbon, and that the oxygen and
hydrogen constituting the bulk of the remaining (50 per cent,
are chemically equivalent to each other, that is to say, that
they are present in the proportions which would form water.
At this rate of growth (viz. 1 ton of dry wood &e. per acre),
there would be 0-4 ron of carbon per acre per annum separated
from atmospheric carbonic acid, or 256 tons per square mile
per annum. If we now take the land-surface of the earth
at 50,000,000 square miles, this makes a total quantity of
12,800,000,000 (nearly 13 thousand million) tons of carbon
per annum. If we next assume that all this carbon is
deposited and preserved in the form of coal, and that the
process goes on at the same rate year after year, it is easy to
see that in rather less than 40,000 years we should have the
500,000.000,000,000 tons of coal that are equivalent to the
whole of our free oxygen. But of course we know very well
that by far the most of the vegetable matter now grown on
the earth is soon re-oxidized into carbonic acid and water,
                  * Communicated by the Author.

400           Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
partly by animal nutrition and respiration, partly by rapid
combustion in fires, and very largely by eremacausis, or slow
oxidation and decay under the influence of air and moisture.
The proportion that escapes oxidation through being deposited
under fairly aseptic conditions, as in peat bogs, or by being
swept out to sea and deposited along with other matters
beyond the reach of atmospheric oxygen, is relatively very
small. We have no data to guide us as to its total amount,
but if we call it 25,000,000 tons annually —this being, as we
have seen, the quantity of coal that would have to be deposited
annually to give us 500,000,000,000,000 tons in 20,000,000
years—the proportion of vegetable remains preserved in the
form of coal would be equal to about the ^[tj part of the total
carbon separated from the atmosphere annually by vegeta
tion. Again, if we c;ill the annual production of coal 740,000
tons (the amount that would give us 500,000,000,000,000
tons in 680,000,000 years), we should have the —^ part of
the carbon separated by vegetation permanently preserved in
the form of coal. Of these figures the latter (17^) seems
credible enough ; and if the former (^ }2) should seem to be
rather high for modern times, it is by no means incredible
when taken as an average for the whole of geological history.
For if there was no free oxygen in the earth's primitive
atmosphere, and we may fairly enough say that by hypothesis
there must have been none if on the average 25,000,000 tons
of coal have been annually deposited and permanently pre
served for the last 20,000,000 years, then there could at first be
no eremacausis or other oxidation of vegetable remains due to
atmospheric oxygen ; and therefore those who hold that there
was no primitive free oxygen may confidently say that a much
larger proportion of vegetable remains could be preserved then
in the form of coal than is possible at the present day. Even
without going so far as to postulate that there was no free
oxygen, but simply by making the probable assumption that the
|>ercentagc of free oxygen in the atmosphere was considerably
 ess than it is now, and that the percentage of carbonic acid was
considerably greater than it is now. it could be maintained
that eremacausis and other modes of atmospheric oxidation
were in all probability much less active than they are now,
and therefore that a larger proportion of vegetable remains
would be preserved as coal than is now possible. We may
therefore conclude that though this line of inquiry, like our
previous ones, does not give exact and definite results, it at
least puts no serious difficulty in the way of making a high
estimate of the world's supply of coal.
   Our efforts so far have been directed specially to the object

              Geological History of the Atmosphere.         401
of ascertaining the probable amount of the world's supply of
coal, or at least of ascertaining whether a high estimate of the
total carbonaceous matter of the earth —high enough to make
it equivalent to our free oxygen—is at all credible. We think
that the general results indicate that this high estimate is
quite credible.       But even supposing that the evidence
pointed distinctly in the opposite direction—supposing that
there was good reason to believe that there was not enough
fuel of a carbonaceous nature to use up all our free oxygen,
it would not tollow that there must have been at least some
free oxygen in the earth's primitive atmosphere. It is quite
possible that a large quantity of organic matter may have
been deposited in certain rocks, and may afterwards have dis
appeared while the free oxygen corresponding to it still
 remains in the free condition. For it is well-known that
 there is found distributed through many rocks a considerable
amount of sulphide of iron, which is an eminently oxidizable
 substance. There is also little doubt but that it has, in the
 case of strati tied rocks, been produced from oxide (or car
 bonate) of iron and sulphate of lime by the reducing action
 of carbonaceous matter derived from animal and vegetable
 remains. It may therefore, like coal, be regarded as a fuel of
 vegetable origin, and the amount of oxygen that would be
 required for its complete oxidation may be regarded as so much
 oxygen that has been separated from carbonic acid by the
 action of vegetation. We should therefore be justified, when
 estimating the free oxygen produced by vegetation on the
 earth, to include not only the oxygen corresponding to all
 the carbonaceous matter derived from animal and vegetable
 remains, but also the amount of oxygen corresponding to the
 sulphide of iron found in sedimentary rocks. We cannot give
even an approximate estimate of the percentage of sulphide of
 iron in such rocks, but we know that it is fairly high—quite
 comparable with that of the organic or carbonaceous matter
itself, and therefore of great importance in the question of
the history of iree oxygen.
    A large amount of sulphide of iron is also found in metal
 liferous lodes or veins. Other metallic sulphides are also
found in these veins, and, as is well-known, constitute the
 principal ores of lead, zinc, mercury, antimony, copper, and
other metals. The circumstance that these ores consist
principally of sulphides, and contain but little oxygen except
in the upper part of the veins, where they have in all proba
bility been oxidized by the action of air and water, indicates
that there is, most probably, a deficiency of oxygen in the
 regions of the earth from which the material filling the lodes
is derived.      It is of course just possible that the ores or

402           Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
 metallic compounds were at first well oxidized, and were
afterwards reduced to sulphides by the action of hydrocarbon
gases or similar compounds derived from carbonaceous matter
in the adjacent rocks. If this were the case, a considerable
quantity of carbonaceous matter would be required to account
for the total amount of sulphides in metalliferous veins. It
 would, however, be rather difficult to form an estimate, and
it is possible that the amount required might not be so great
as to be at all comparable with the whole of our free oxygen.
But it is much more likely that the sulphides and similar
compounds (selenides, arsenides, <fcc.) were present as such from
the very beginning of the history of the lodes ; that is, from
the time when the metallic compounds and the accompanying
materials were injected or otherwise conveyed into the veins ;
and as these materials have probably been derived from more
deeply lying regions of the earth's crust, their composition
points to a general deficiency of oxygen on the earth as a
whole.
    Reference may be made at this stage to the large quantities
of petroleum and natural gas which are found in many places
in the earth's crust. These may not be so great as to be
comparable in amount with our total supply of coal, but still
they probably constitute a by no means negligible quantity of
oxidizable matter. If we hold the theory that they are
entirely derived from animal and vegetable remains by
destructive distillation, or by the molecular transmutation, of
fatty matters, the quantity is at least sufficient to add an
appreciable amount of support to a high estimate of the
world's supply of fuel derived from organic remains. And
if we adopt MendeleetFs theory that they have been formed
by the action of steam or water on carbide of iron and other
 metallic carbides in hot interior regions of the earth, we must
infer that there is a deficiency of oxygen on the earth
 relatively to the amount of oxidizable matter present.
   The observations made by Prof. Til den on the nature of the
gases enclosed in granite and basaltic rocks, and quoted by
Lord Kelvin himself, have a similar corollary. That is to
say, if granite and basalt have been produced out of ancient
sedimentary rocks, then there must have been an appreciable
quantify of organic matter or " reducing " matter of some
kind present in these rocks ; while if they are derived from
more primitive materials than sedimentary rocks, they go to
indicate a deficiency of oxygen on the earth as a whole.
   This question about the excess or deficiency of oxygen on
the earth relatively to the amount of oxidizable matter present,
is of course not identical with our main question regarding

              Geological History of the Atmosphere.          403
the history of free oxygen, but it is closely related to it, and
we will therefore discuss it separately for a little.
   A simple calculation will show that our total free oxygen
is only a small fraction of the total oxygen of the earth. In the
sea alone, which weighs roughly 1,400,000,000,000,000,000
(fourteen hundred thousand million million) tons, and con
tains about 85 per cent, by weight of oxygen, there is nearly
1000 times as much oxygen as there is in the atmosphere. This
oxygen is very nearly all in the combined condition, the free
oxygen dissolved in sea-water being very small in amount, even
when compared with the amount of atmospheric oxygen itself.
Further, the crust, or solid envelope of the earth as known to
geologists, is estimated to contain about 50 per cent, of its
weight of oxygen, and all in the combined condition. Now
if we suppose the crust having this average composition to
be 10 miles thick, and its specific gravity to be about 2^ times
that of water, it will weigh about 10 times as much as the
sea, and the oxygen contained in it will be about G times as
much as that in the sea, or C000 times as much as that in the
atmosphere. It is quite clear therefore that the total amount of
free oxygen in the world is very small when compared with that
of combined oxygen. Therefore, if there is an excess or
surplus of oxygen on the earth after satisfying the require
ments of the elements for which it has an affinity, that surplus
must be relatively a very small one.
    But further still, if the whole earth, which weighs 1,200,000
times as much as the atmosphere, or 5,000,000 times as much
as the free oxygen of the atmosphere, should contain 50 per
cent, of oxygen throughout, then the total combined oxygen
of the earth will be 2,500,000 times as much as the free.
However, even if we assume that the earth is thoroughly
oxidized throughout, this estimate will have to be modified
considerably in order to bring it into better conformity with
the well-known fact that the specific gravity of the earth as
a whole is much higher than that of the crust or envelope
with which we are acquainted. The principal substances
which exist in the interior of the earth must therefore be
much heavier than those found near the surface ; but still if
they are oxides, or oxygen compounds, we might reasonably
expect them — still judging from the specific gravity of the
earth—to contain roughly about 20 per cent, of oxygen.
This would make the total combined oxygen of the earth
1,000,000 times as much as the free. That is to say. if the
earth as a whole is composed of well-oxidized materials, it
would have to contain something like this amount of oxygen;
and whatever the oxact figure may be, it is obvious that there

404            Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
must be a truly wonderful degree of exactness in the adjust
ment of the amount of oxygen on the earth to the amount of
oxidizable substances, if they balance each other down to the
f.uuo.nou Par* or the total weight of either. Looked at from a
purely abstract standpoint, the standpoint of mathematical pro
bability, so very exact a de^reeof balancing is extremely impro
bable. We know practically nothing of the principles on which
the various chemical elements are distributed on the earth and
throughout the universe ; but let us assume for the moment
that there is no principle at all, or nothing more definite than
chance. On this principle, or want of principle, the proba
bility that the totnl amount of oxygen on the earth will
amount to any particular figure is substantially equal to the
probability that it will amount to any other figure, out of a
practically infinite number of figures, which are limited only
by the condition that they must be considerably less
than the total weight of the earth itself—the limit being some
thing like one-half or one-fifth of the weight of the earth.
As the possible figures, all equally probable, are practically
infinite in number, the chances against any one figure being
the correct one are practically infinite. If, then, we do not
know, even on the roughest approximation, the amount of
oxygen on the earth, but have two theories regarding a
particular terrestrial problem, one of which requires that the
total oxygen on the earth should be exactly, or almost exactly,
of a particular amount, viz., just a very little more than the
amount that is equivalent to the total oxidizable matter on the
earth ; while the second theory admits of the amount of oxygen
being anything at all within a very wide range—from a rough
(but inadequate) equivalence to the total oxidizable matter
down to a very small fraction — say the isVrr Pill"t 0I' that
amount, then, obviously, the latter theory has on a priori
grounds an incomparably greater probability of being the
correct one. Clearly, therefore, the inference from the above
line of reasoning is that there is a deficiency of oxygen on
the earth relatively to the total amount of oxidizable matter.
    The objection may be made that certain other elements, viz.,
 chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine—which have not much
 affinity for oxygen but which have a strong affinity for other
 elements, and may therefore be regarded as rivals to oxygen
 or substitutes for it — may possibly be present on the earth in
 large quantity. The reply to this is a simple one, viz., that
 they are met with to only a small extent (relatively speaking)
 on the surface of the earth ; and even if they were present in
 much larger quantities deeper down, that circumstance would
 not materially affect the force of the above line of reasoning.

                Geological History of the Atmosphere.             405
  Instead of saying that there must be a nearly exact balancing
  of oxygen and oxidizable matter on the earth if there is an
  excess of oxygen at all, we should have to say that the total
  quantity of oxygen and of halogens has been adjusted with
  great exactness to the total amount of other elements— a
  position which is very similar to the one already discussed.
     It may, however, be argued that though there should be a
  deficiency of oxygen on the earth, relatively to the other
  elements, it does not necessarily follow that there ever was a
  time when there was no free oxygen in the earth's atmosphere.
  According to usuallv accepted theories, the temperature of the
  earth was at one time very high—red, or possibly even white hot
 throughout. The temperature could therefore quite well have
  been above the dissociation-point of most oxides or oxygen
 compounds, and therefore the earth's supply of oxygen, or a
 large proportion of it, may have existed in the free condition.
  On cooling down it would unite with those elements for
 which it had the greatest affinity, and with which it came
 into most frequent contact ; but being a gas it would all
 exist in the atmosphere, and would not come into intimate
 contact with the original liquid nucleus of the earth, which
 would probably consist principally of heavy metals, or heavy
 metals combined with more or less sulphur, silicon, carbon,
 nitrogen, &c. The oxygen would probably therefore combine
 first with the lighter and more oxidizable elements, e. <j. silicon,
 carbon, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and
 sodium ; and owing to the great abundance of silicon, and its
 strong affinity for oxygen, a large quantity of silica, or of
 silicates, would be formed. It is quite possible, then, that
 before all the oxygen had passed into the combined condition,
 a thick layer of silicates would be formed which would prevent
 the remaining oxygen from getting access to the still oxi
 dizable iron and other elements lower down.
    This is quite a plausible theory ; but still it does not quite
surmount the balancing difficulty. Any one holding it will
still have to admit that our total free oxygen bears only a
very small ratio to the amount of combined oxygen on the
earth ; for the latter is, as we have seen, on the lowest possible
computation, about 6000 times as much as the free. The
earth's supply of oxygen has therefore combined to the extent
of at least 99-98 per cent, of its total amount with oxidizable
matters, and as there is still a considerable quantity of oxi
dizable matter within easy reach (geologically speaking) of
the remaining oxygen, it is difficult to see why the oxygen
should not all have gone into combination by this time, if it
were not for the operation of some counteracting influence. It
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 50. No. 305. Oct. 1900.         2 F

406          Mr. J. Stevenson on the Chemical and
is an altogether simpler and more credible hypothesis to
suppose that the oxygen was all in the combined condition at
one time ; and even the additional supposition that there was a
considerable amount of hydrogen or of hydrocarbon gases left
over in the atmosphere after all the oxygen had gone into
combination, is not at all incredible.
    A theory or supposition of this kind is no doubt somewhat
startling, but it is supported \ y solar and stellar analog)' in
the most emphatic manner. The sun and many other stars
 contain, as is well known, large quantities of free hydrogen
gas, but no oxygen whatever has been found in any of them
by spectroscopic examination. This, of course, may be due
 to the circumstance that oxygen, though present is, combined
 in forms which do not reveal themselves to the spectroscope,
 or that oxygen even when free is not readily observed in a
 flame by means of the spectroscope. However that may be,
 we know that there is a great abundance of free hydrogen
 on the sun ami many stars, while not a trace of free oxygen
 has been observed with certainty as yet.
     Another observation of the same kind is that of Sir W. de W.
 Abney, regarding the absorption spectra of the attenuated
 gases which are supposed to be present in interstellar space.
 He considered that his observations pointed to the existence
 of the vapour of benzene, a well-known hydrocarbon, in these
 highly vacuous regions.
     But there is additional evidence of this kind, and evidence
 which brings the observation much nearer the earth itself,
 viz., the circumstance that meteorites have been found which
 contained occluded hydrogen. In all probability the meteorites
 which have fallen on the earth previously travelled round the
 sun in orbits not greatly differing from that of the earth, at
 least as regards the average distance from the sun. We
  should therefore, on the ordinary theories of the formation of
 the solar system, naturally expect them to contain roughly
  the same elements as the earth, and roughly also in the same
  proportion. Now it is well-known that meteorites frequently
  contain a large amount of metallic iron or iron carbides, and
  similar oxidizable substances. Compounds containing oxygen
  are no doubt also found, and sometimes in considerable
  quantity, but there is never enough oxygen present to com
  pletely oxidize all the other elements. The composition and
  mineralogical character of these compounds also seem to pre
  clude the existence of free oxygen on the meteorites or the
  materials from wh'ch they are formed. Prof. H. Newton has
  made the significant observation that they are very similar to
   the minerals which are found on the earth in deep-seated

                Geological History of the Atmosphere.         407
 rocks, and tbat probably an essential condition to their
  formation is the absence of free oxygen and of water. When
  we also remember the large proportion of metallic iron or
 iron carbide that is usually found in meteorites, and that
 among the other constituents there are found sulphides,
 nitrides, and even phosphides— the last being a class of com
 pound that has not been found on the earth at all in a properly
 telluric form—we can easily see that meteorites are very
 imperfectly oxidized, and probably never contained free
 oxygen.
    If, therefore, the earth is analogous to the other members of
 the solar system with which we are best acquainted, viz. the
 sun itself and the meteorites wrhich have fallen on the earth,
 it must obviously be very imperfectly oxidized—the oxygen
 present must be much less than that required for the complete
 oxidation of the other elements. It does not necessarily
 follow from this that there never was any free oxygen in the
 earth's atmosphere in primitive times ; but it follows that
 there probably was a time, and possibly a long time, when
 there was none. On this hypothesis our present supply of
 free oxygen has been all produced by the action of sunlight
 on vegetation ; and if we hold that the primitivo atmosphere
 of the earth contained free hydrogen or hydrocarbon gases,
 then the amount of oxygen liberated by vegetation must have
 been even greater than that of our present free oxygen, for a
 large quantity may have been used up in oxidizing the
 hydrogen and hydrocarbon gases to water and carbonic acid.
    The most important evidence on our general subject is
probably that derived from the study of the amount of car
bonaceous and other oxidizable matter due to vegetation which
is found on the earth. Our information on this point is very
imperfect as yet, but it indicates that a high estimate —an
estimate which makes it equivalent to the free oxygen of the
atmosphere—is quite possible, and even probable. We may
expect that our information will become much more exact in
course of time, and that it may yet enable us to give a decisive
answer to the question before us ; but we can say in the
meantime that the available evidence indicates that the theory
is quite credible that there was a time when there was no
free oxygen on the earth.
    [Note added Sept. 25tk.—With reference to the argument
on page 401 I may add that Ebelmen in his essay on the
Decomposition of Silicates (published 1845) considers that
the amount of iron pyrites existing on the earth is probably
more than equivalent to the total free oxygen of the atmo
sphere.]

        XXXIX. Tlie Annual March of Temperature.
          By R. J. A. Barnard, M.A., Melbourne*.
THE accompanying curves give the results of an examina
       tion of the temperature for forty years at Melbourne,
and wore suggested by Rijkevorsel's work on European
meteorological elements.
   The process adopted was as follows :—The forty years'
observations were divided into two groups, 1859-78 and
1879-98. In each group the average for each day is obtained
and smoothed twice by replacing the temperature of each day
by the mean of the five consecutive days of which the par
ticular day is the middle. The results of the second smooth
ing are given.
   An examination of the curves does not lead to such definite
results as given by Kijkcvorsel for Europe, but some striking
correspondences are noticeable, the most marked being that
at the end of March. In the second week of March it will be
 found that the temperature begins to drop rapidly, reaching a
secondary minimum for each curve on the 19th. It then
rises again to the extent of 2°- f> during the next week, reaching
a maximum on the 2.">th and 2lith, the date being again the
 same for both. I have examined the four groups of ten years,
 and all the curves show the same minimum and maximum in
 March. The curves for the first three weeks of January,
for the whole of April, and some other parts also show great
 resemblances, but in many other cases where the curves appear
 very similar the times of the secondary maxima and minima
 do not coincide sufficiently closely in time, and in some parts
 the maxima of one occur with the minima of the other.
   The conclusions I am inclined to draw from my results are
the following :—First, that the spells of weather are in all
probability not so marked here as in Europe. If this is so
the probable cause lies in the more uniform conditions of the
southern hemisphere, tending to make the annual march more
uniform and free from spells. Secondly, 1 do not think that
a period of less than 40 years can give any real information
about spells. For example, if one had only the first curve
of the figure, the spells in June would seem to be quite as
striking as that in March, yet the second curve is exactly
opposite in the former case. Thirdly, I have no doubt that
to establish the existence of spells the most satisfactory method
is to take the observations of a particular place and divide
them into groups and compare them as I have done, and that
these groups should not be less than 20 years each.

XL. Notes on the Measurement of some Standard Resistances.
   By R. T. Glazebrook, M.A., F.R.S., Director of the
   National Physical Laboratory *.
THE problem of comparing together two nearly equal
        resistance-coils is a much simpler one than that of
determining the resistance of a coil of 10, 100, or 1000 ohms
in terms of the unit coils. There are various methods by
which such comparisons may be made. I had occasion some
little time back to determine the resistance of certain coils of
10, 100, and 1000 ohms. I made each determination pur
posely by two or more methods; and it may be useful to put
the results on record with a view of indicating the accuracy
which can be reached without any very elaborate precautions.
The coils in question were all of platinum-silver with a tem
perature-coefficient of about "00028 per 1° C; and by far the
most important source of error is the uncertainty of the tem
perature.
   The 10-ohm coils were measured in three different ways.
The first (Method I.) was that employed in constructing
the standards of the British Association, and is described in
the Report of the B. A. Committee for 1883.
   Three 3-ohm coils are wround on the same bobbin. The
bobbin is enclosed in a box one face of which is of ebonite
through which the six electrodes of stout copper rod project.
By means of an arrangement of mercury cups these three
coils can be placed in series or in multiple arc. I have
acquired the habit of calling this box with its projecting legs
the Beetle, and denoting its resistance when in multiple arc
by the letter B.
   Let the resistances of the three coils be 3 + a, 3 + yS, and
3 + 7 respectively. Then
            1       * +.A+ X
            B    3+a      3 + /3   3+7
                        -l-i(« + /3 + 7)+^7(«2 + /9s + 72),
omitting higher powers of the small quantities x, /9, 7.
Hence
    B=l+ I (a + p + y)- ¦£ (^ + /3H72-«/9-y97-y«).
    Hence if a, /3, and 7 are nearly equal, the third term is
     * Communicated by the Physical Society : read May 25, 1900.

       On tlie Measurement of some Standard Resistances.   411
 very small, and we have very approximately
                        B = l+ g(* + /9 + T).
    Now it is comparatively easy to adjust the three 3-ohm
 coils to equality, and an accurate 3-ohm standard is not
 required.
    Hence, if B' be the resistance of the combination when all
 the coils are in series, then
                  B'=3 + * + 3 + /3 + 3 + 7=9B.
    Or the resistance of the arrangement in series is very ap
 proximately 9 times that when in multiple arc.
    The arrangement of mercury cups is shown in fig. 1. A
number of holes about '75 centim. diameter are bored through
                               Kg i.

a sheet of ebonite. Thick strips of copper of the form shown
in the figure are cemented to the under side of the ebonite,
the surface of the copper in contact with the ebonite being
amalgamated, and the cups thus formed contain mercury.
   In the multiple-arc position the 3-ohm coils are connected
with AA', BB', CO respectively; in the series position they
connect DD', EE', FF', while a coil of 1 ohm is placed across
GGr1. The cups I., II. serve to connect the system to the
bridge.
   Let the resistance of the short rods used for this purpose
be U, and the resistance of the 10-ohm coil whose value is
required be X.
   The first operation is to compare by Carey-Foster's method
the Beetle in the multiple-arc position and a standard 1-ohm
coil S ; let x± be the shift on the bridge-wire.

412                 Mf. R. T. Glazebrook on the
    Then we have
                           B + U=S+*„
or
                           B = S + #,-U.
    Next S is placed across the gap GG* and the Beetle moved
into the series position ; the combination is then compared
with the 10-ohm coil ; let .r2 be the shift. Then
                        X = 9B + U + S + ^2,
                          = 108-811+9*!+ a*.
     So that it' U the resistance of the contact-pieces is known,
 the value of X is found in terms of S.
     The chief source of error arises from the difficulty of main
 taining the temperature of the Beetle sufficiently steady during
 the measurements. The consequences due to this can be re
 duced by taking a series of measurements in order, first with
 the Beetle in multiple arc, then with it in series. If a given
 coil be tested by this method at varying temperatures, the
 observations usually lie on a smooth curve to within about
 0°-05 C.
     The method was I believe originally devised by Lord
 Bayleigh in order to construct a coil of 25 ohms from one of
 1 ohm. He employed five coils of 5 ohms each ; it is the
 method by which the 10-ohm coils of the Association were
 constructed.
     The other methods employed to determine the 10-ohm coils
 were both build-up methods. Messrs. Nalder, Bros., kindly
 put at my disposal a number of boxes arranged as described
  below.
     Each box contained five coils in series and of the values 1,"
  1, 2, '6, and 4 units. The two ends of the whole series were per
 manently connected to two mercury cups, and each junction
 of two consecutive coils was connected to a mercury cup.
     Thus the resistance of the series is 10 times that of the first
 coil.
     The coils are enclosed in a wooden box, and are numbered 1 a,
  1 b, 2, 3, 4; the unit may be either 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ohms.
     The arrangement may be used in two different ways ; it is
 shown diagrammatically in fig. 2.
     Method II.—Coil 1 a is connected by contact-pieces of
 known resistance to the Carey- Foster bridge and compared
 with a known standard S. The; value 1 b is found similarly.
     Then S is replaced by an ordinary box of coils, and coil 2
 of this box is compared with 1 a + lb in series ; coil 2 of the

          Measurement of some Standard Resistances.         413
build-up contrivance is then compared with coil 2 of the
box, and hence with 1 a + I l>. The comparisons are all done
on the Carey-Foster bridge, so that ultimately each coil of
the build-up box is known in terms of S and the bridge-wire.
Finally, the unknown coil X is compared with 1 a + lb + 2
 + 3 + 4.
                        /a       'b     a      3      <f
   The objection to this method is that it takes some time,
and temperature changes lead to difficulty.
   Method III.—Although Method II. is applicable to boxes
in which the unit is greater than one ohm, it becomes difficult
of application unless the wire of the Carey-Foster bridge can
be altered. In my bridge the resistance of 1 millim. is
•00005 ohm, and the difference between two coils of 50 or
100 ohms, nominal value, may easily be greater than the
whole bridge-wire resistance-
   It was desirable therefore to devise a method of measuring
the resistance of the coils of the box which did not involve
the Carey-Foster bridge for the higher resistances.
   Two 10-ohm coils P and Q were taken and their difference
accurately found on the Carey-Foster bridge; thus, the differ
ence being small, the ratio P/Q is known accurately. The
value of the coil 1 a is also found on the Carey-Foster bridge.
   Four mercury cups, A, B, C, D (fig. 2), are arranged at
the corner of a square ; the gaps AB, BC contain the coils P, Q

414               Mr. R. T. Glazebrook on the
respectively. The coil 1 a is connected by suitable pieces to
A and D, and 1 b to D and C respectively.
   The resistances of the connecting-rods should be equal.
   A battery connects B and D, a galvanometer connects A
and C.
   If P is equal to Q and 1 a to 1 b, then there will be a balance ;
if this is not the case, a balance can be found by shunting P
or Q with a resistance W. This resistance need not be
accurately known. Thus 1 b can be found in terms of 1 a. Then
Ib+la can be placed between A and D, and 2 between D
and C. Hence 2 can be found and so on. In this manner
finally the value of the whole is known.
   In the experiments referred to the values of certain
standard 10-ohm coils were determined, in all cases by two
at least of these methods, with a view to testing the accuracy
of the determination. Table I. gives the result.
                               Table I.

   The first method appears to give slightly higher results
than the others, but the differences, with one exception, would
be caused by an uncertainty of 0°-l 0., and no attempt was
made to read the thermometers to a greater accuracy than
this.
   In the case of the 100 and 1000-ohm coils Method III. was
used ; and also a fourth method (Method IV.), that ordinarily
employed in testing such coils for the B. A. Committee.
   A bridge is formed consisting of the 100-ohm coil to be
tested, two 10-ohin coils, and a unit ; then by shunting one
arm as in Method III., by a resistance which does not require

          Measurement of some Standard Resistances.             415
to be accurately known, the value of the 100-ohm coil can be
found. In this way the following results were obtained :—

    In one case only is the difference greater than that due to
 an error in temperature comparable with 0o-l C, and it will
 be noticed that the difference between two determinations of
 the same coil by Method IV. is comparable with the differences
 between the results of the two methods.
    It thus appears that to an accuracy of some two or three
 parts in one hundred thousand, the various methods lead to
 the same results. To reach a higher accuracy would involve,
 if the coils were of platinum-silver, the knowledge of their
 temperature to less than 0o,l C. The end might, however,
 better be attained by employing manganin or some such
 alloy.
    Possibly this paper may serve a useful purpose by calling
 attention to the various methods which may be employed to
 build up multiples of a unit resistance and by giving some
 account of the accuracy attained.
    A source of uncertainty in resistance measurements is due
 to the fact that the coils are heated by the current. Tt is
 clear that the currents traversing the 1000-ohm coil in the
 two arrangements described above were different ; the concord
 ance of the results tends to show that the error due to heating
 was in these experiments negligible.
                 Appendix.—Added Sept. 18, 1900.
    In the theory of Method I. given above, no notice is taken
  of the fact that the length of copper connecting each of

416                  Mr. H. E. Wimperis on
the three 3-ohm coils to the bridge is different. It is easy to
do this thus:—Let the resistance between each of the adjacent
cups, such as I to A, A to B, B to C &c. be y ohms. Then
the resistances of the 3-ohm coils in the multiple arc position
are 3 + a + 2y, 3 + /3 + Ay, and 3 + y + 6y respectively, and
neglecting squares of small quantities as before, we have
                    B = l + ij(* + /3 + y + l2y).
While the series value of the coils is easily seen to be
                      B'=9 + a + /3 + y + 9y
                        = 9B-3y.
The value of y is found by connecting I. and II. to the
bridge, short-circuitiug the other gap of the bridge and then
short-circuiting in turn AA', BB', CO', and finding a series
of balance-points. The difference of the readings thus found
gives a. In the case of the apparatus used the mean of a
number of readings gave
          tt = *4 bridge-wire divisions ='00002 ohms.
So that instead of putting B' = 9B in reducing the results it
would have been more accurate to write B' = 9B — •00006.
The correction is too small to be of importance. I also found
that at a temperature of 16° the value of the 3-ohm coils
were respectively 3*0038, 3*0026, and 3"0027.
XLI. Experiments on the Elasticity of Wires. By H. E.
   Wimperis, B.A., Whitworth Scholar, Late Salomons and
   Foundation Scholar of Caius College, Cambridge, Demon
   strator in the University Engineering Laboratory*.
IN the Philosophical Magazine for February 1900 Mr. G.
      F. C. Searle described an apparatus he had used to deter
mine some elastic constants for wires of different metals. One
very curious result which be obtained was that the value of
Poisson's ratio found for certain metals was greater than £,
notably in the case of copper whether hardened or anuealed.
   Mr. Searle's deduction was that " wires of these four sub
stances (copper, nickel, platinoid, and german-silver) are so
far from being isotropic, that it is improper to apply the
theory of isotropic solids to them."
   It was suggested to the author by Professor Ewing that it

                    tlw Elasticity of Wires.              417
would be of interest to extend these experiments to wires of
larger diameter; this suggestion was followed with results
appended below.
   In the author's experiments six different wires were used
(one of which was hollow), of diameters varying from ^inch
to I inch. These diameters are greater than those measured
by Mr. Searle (which were from ^ inch to -fa inch), thus
necessitating a much larger apparatus—the moment of inertia
of the vibrating rods being over six times as great.
   It is not necessary to repeat the mathematical theory given
by Mr. Searle, but the apparatus is shown in fig. 1.
                              Fisr. 1.

    NP and LM are square bars with holes drilled at R and S
 to admit the wire under test at RS. H and K are two
 j^r-inch screws by means of which the vibrating wire is
 clamped and the apparatus supported.
    The method of experiment is as follows:—The apparatus is
 suspended so that the two swinging bars are in a horizontal
 plane ; the ends at M and P are next inclined to each other
 and tied with strong cotton-thread. When the apparatus has
 come to rest, this thread is burnt and the number of swings
 per second is estimated by timing a convenient number with
 a stop-watch. The period so obtained is called fj.
    It is an important experimental point that, owing to non-
 uniformity of diameter in the wire under test, the two rods
 should be rotated relative to the wire through 90°, and a
 re-determination of i, made. In the following experiments

 418                   Mr. H. E. Wimperis on
 this plan was adopted and the results are given : very little
 variation was found.
    The next step is to clamp one rod horizontally and allow
 the other to hang down below, the under one is then slightly
 rotated — so twisting the wire— and released. The period of this
 vibration is also found, and called t.2.
    Here again a re-determination is made by turning the appa
 ratus upside down ; this corrects variations in the moment of
 inertia of the rods.
    The constants of the apparatus were carefully determined
 thus :—

 wire, the diameter given in every case is the mean of 10 mea
 surements ; the length is measured between the centres of the
 grips.
     It will be noticed that in no case was a value of Poisson's
  ratio found greater than 0*461 ; this, in view of the fact that
  Air. Searle obtained several values above 0'5, is of interest
 as illustrating a possible effect of the increase in diameter of
 ihe wires used.
     In conclusion the author wishes to thank Professor Ewing
  both for advice and the use of the different materials provided.
  The above experiments were carried out in the Engineering
  Laboratory at Cambridge.

    XLII. A Comparison of Platinum Thermometers of different
      degrees of Purity. By H. M. Tort, M.A., Mathematical
       Lecturer at Mc Gill College, Montreal*.
    1. rrVHJS investigation was undertaken at the suggestion of
        JL Professor Callendar with a view to determining the
   probable order of accuracy in the determination of high
    temperatures attainable by the use of ordinary commercial
    specimens of platinum wire. It was also desired to observe
   the effect of large variations in the purity of the wire, in
   order to be able to estimate the probable effect of such small
   impurities as were likely to occur in pure wires specially
   selected for pyrometry. Five wires in all were compared
   over the range 400° to 1000° C. The fundamental coefficients
   of the wires (which may be taken as an indication of the
   purity) varied from '003892 to "002340, i. e. by 40 per cent,
   of the maximum value. It was found, however, that the
   extreme variations of the temperatures observed, when calcu
   lated on the platinum scale by the formula
                     pt = 100(R-Ro)/(R'-R°), .... (1)
   in which the letters R, R', and R° stand for the observed
   resistance at the temperatures pt, 100°, and 0° C. respectively,
  did not in any case exceed 9° C. at 1000° C-, or were less than
   one per cent, on the interval at any point of the range of
  observation, in spite of the large differences in the samples.
      When the temperatures were reduced by means of the
  difference-formula
                     t-pt = dt(J.-100)/lQ,00(), .... (2)
  although the agreement was found to be exceedingly
  close at temperatures up to 500° C. (if the value of the
  difference-coefficient d was calculated by assuming the boiling-
  point of sulphur (S.B.P.) to be 444d-53C., by the method
 proposed by Callendar and Griffiths), the discrepancies at
  1000° were still of the order of 5° or 10° C. We must con
 clude that this method of reduction by reference to the
 S.B.P. will not give results of the highest accuracy if
 applied to impure wires at 1000° C. This point has also been
 illustrated by Callendar (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1899). It was
 found, however, that very fair agreement could be obtained
 at high temperatures by using the freezing-point of silver
 (AgF.P.) as a secondary fixed point instead of the S.B.P.
in the calculation of the difference-coefficient. For two of
the wires the simple method of reduction employed by
Heycock and Neville (Journ. Chem. Soc. Feb. 1895, and
      * Communicated by the Physical Society : read June 22, 1900.

422                   Mr. H. M. Tory on the
Phil. Mag. Feb. 1899, p. 200) gave results agreeing with the
standard wire almost within the limits of error of observation,
but did not apply so well in the case of the most impure
specimens. It was observed, however, that the differences
of the platinum temperatures for all the wires could be very
closely represented between the limits of observation by
linear formulae. If the observed values of pt for each wire
were first reduced to the standard pt in each case by the
linear relation, and then corrected by the same difference-
 formula as the standard wire, very consistent results were
 obtained from all the wires. This method would not be
applicable below 400° C, but it might prove a suitable type
of formula for purposes of extrapolation, in case it was
necessary to employ impure wires.
    It is probable that the platinum wires used in this investiga
 tion were free from contamination with baser metals outside
 the platinum group. Under proper conditions they all showed
 great constancy of zero, and the variation of the difference-
coefficients (from 1*50 to 1*67) was comparatively small.
 By contamination with baser or more volatile metals, it
 is possible to get much larger variations in the values of pt
 and d ; but such pyrometers will not show constant results
 until the volatile constituents have been burnt out. Special
attention was given to the effects of annealing which may
produce changes of zero of the order of one degree after the
first exposure to a temperature of 1000° (J. With this excep
tion, no changes of zero of any importance were observed, as
the temperatures employed never exceeded 1000° G.
    2. Methods and Apparatus.—The method of comparison
adopted was that described by Callendar (Phil. Trans. A, 1887,
p. 161), in which the wires to be compared are wound side by
side in the same tube, so as to be always at the same mean
temperature. This method appears to be more accurate than
the method of indirect comparison of pyrometers in separate
tubes. Observations were taken at steady temperatures only,
in a well-stirred bath of melted tin. The apparatus was
arranged so that the readings of the two pyrometers were
almost simultaneous. Each wire was directly compared with
the pure standard wire ; and in addition a specimen of the
standard was drawn down to half section, and compared with the
original wire. The agreement was found to be exact through
out the scale, as was to be expected with so pure a wire.
The wires were wound on mica strips with platinum leads
insulated in the usual manner. Each double pyrometer,
when completed, had six leads, two each for the pyrometer
coils, and two compensating leads. The resistance-box used

             Comparison of Platinum Thermometers.            423
 was one of the type described by Callendar (Phil. Mag. July
 1891) with coils on the binary scale, standardized in the usual
 manner. The contact surfaces of the screw-nuts used for
 short-circuiting the coils were kept clean, and the contacts
 frequently tested. The galvanometer u*ed was one specially
designed by Prof. Callendar (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1892) for
resistance pyrometer work, with an astatic-needle system in
 which the control is due to the passage of a current through
a pair of coils, marked " Field" in fig. 1, at right angles to
 the position of the galvanometer-coils. The current which
effects the control is proportional to that used in measuring
the resistance, and hence the deflexion due to any given
difference of resistance is constant, no matter what the
current may be. It was found, for example, that the deflexion
for a difference of resistance of one unit of the bridge, was
exactly the same whether a two-volt or four-volt battery was
used.
                              Fig. 1.
   In order to secure a proper sensitiveness of the needle, the
field or control coils were shunted with a small resistance
marked Sh, which was adjusted so that a change of resistance
of one bridge-unit produced a deflexion equal to 10 divisions
of the galvanometer-scale.        By this means, the deflexions
could be read to 1/100 of a degree, which was sufficient for
the purpose.

424                  Mr. H. M. Tory on the
   3. Resistance Measurements.—The ratio-coils of the bridge
were connected permanently in the galvanometer-case, and
had a fixed resistance of about 10 ohms each, being made
exactly eojual. The standard or balancing coil M, against
which the resistances of the pyrometer and box were balanced,
was also fixed permanently in connexion with the galva
nometer, but in such a way that it could be kept in a test-tube
of oil, and its temperature taken after each observation. The
compensating leads (J were in series with this coil. The
adjustable resistance-box B was inserted in the same arm as
the pyrometer, and readings were taken by the method of
substitution, so as to keep the resistance in circuit constant.
    Before the pyrometer was put in the circuit, the balancing-
coil M was adjusted exactly equal to the total resistance of
the box B at 20° C, so that when the pyrometer was inserted
in the same arm as tbe box its resistance could be at once
determined by reading the resistances of the box that were
short-circuited, and taking the deflexion of the galvanometer.
 In addition to the usual coils in the box, namely, 640, 320,
 160, 80, 40, 20, 10 units, two others were added, of 5 and 2
units respectively ; so that deflexions of the galvanometer
greater than 20 scale-divisions were never required to be
taken. Ordinarily it is not necessary to adjust the balancing-
 coil M equal to the resistance of the box, as only the differ
 ences K—R° and R' — R° are required. It was convenient,
however, in order to get the temperature-coefficient of the
wire used. The temperature-coefficient of the platinum-
silver box coils was determined to be '000330 per decree, and
 that of the manganin balancing-coil M to be •000045. All
 the observations were corrected for both box and coil.
    The resistances of the pyrometers used for comparison,
owing to the large differences in the temperature-coefficients
of the wires, differed considerably, excepting at the points
 where they were calculated to agree. The fundamental
interval, R' — R°, was usually calculated for one pyrometer to
 be 100 approximately, and the other to have a nearly equal
 resistance at 500°, the temperature-coefficients being roughly
 determined before the pyrometers were made up. The
 result of this difference of resistance was, that it was found
 exceedingly difficult to take readings of the pyrometers in the
 usual way so quickly as to be sure that the temperature was
 constant to 1/10 of a degree during the process. The pyro
 meters were first connected in series, so that one could be
 immediately short-circuited and the other read after adjusting
 the resistance in the box. The time required to take a reading
 in this way, on account of the swing of the needle of the
 galvanometer, was about three minutes.

       4. Shunt method of Comparison.—In order to get over this
    difficulty and secure simultaneous readings, the following
    method was adopted. The two pyrometers P and Pi were
    connected in series with the resistance-box B, through a
    mercury-cup switch, so that by rocking the top of the switch
    they could be short-circuited one after the other, by means of
    thick copper wires attached to the rocker. Connected with
    the same switch there was an arrangement such that when Pj
    was short-circuited and P was to be measured, the box B was
   shunted by means of a mercury connexion. The shunt-box
    S was then adjusted so that the deflexion of the galvanometer
   for Pj with B unshunted was exactly the same as that of P
   with the shunt S in parallel with B. The shunt S was a
   standard resistance-box in ohms with an attachment for
   reading to tenths. As the shunt S was usually large com
   pared with B, it was not necessary to know S nearer than
   1/10 of an ohm, while the change of resistance, due to the
  change of temperature of the box, was negligible. Further,
  an arrangement was made on the same switch for opening
  and closing the galvanometer circuit, so that the galvanometer
  was opened first and closed last on rocking the switch. The
   result was, since, as before stated, the units of the box were
  so arranged that a deflexion of 20 scale-divisions was the
  largest necessary, that with a little practice the switch could be
  rocked and the deflexions of the two pyrometers read almost
  simultaneously, the needle of the galvanometer not swinging
 more than a couple of scale-divisions. The readings could
 be easily taken within five seconds of each other, and verified
 again and again without the slightest difficulty, as the
 temperature slowly changed. The use of the shunt, while it
 diminished the difficulty of taking observations, somewhat
 increased the labour of calculation. If (P2 — P,) be the
 difference of resistance of the two pyrometers for any tem
 perature, and B the resistance in the box which with the
 pyrometer Pj balances the standard coil M, and if S be the
 shunt to B for the second pyrometer P2, then
                   M = P1+B = P2 + BS/(B + S),

assuming the deflexions of the two pyrometers to be the

(ohms) to units of the pyrometer-box was determined from
equation (3) by observations taken at 0°, 100°, and 444°o
(the boiling-point of sulphur) first with the two pyrometers
separately using the box B only, and then simultaneously,
using the shunt with the second pyrometer.

     5. Method of Heating.—In order to get an accurate com
parison, only steady temperatures were used. For this
purpose, the pyrometers, enclosed in a porcelain tube, were
 heated in an iron pot of molten tin, and the gas-supply regu
 lated by means of a constant-pressure gas-regulator. The
 gas also flowed through a graduated gas-supply regulator,
 so that, with a little patience, almost any temperature between
 400° and 1000° C. could be obtained. The furnace used was
 one whose maximum was 1000°, so that the observations were
 not taken beyond that point. The molten tin was continuously
 stirred by means of an air-engine and stirrer. It was found
 necessary to make the stirrer of fire-clay or tool-steel. When
  iron was used, the action of the tin at its surface, on the iron,
  soon rendered it useless. To prevent oxidation of the tin,
  which took place very rapidly when the surface was exposed,
  and as a result soon filled the pot with tin oxide in a semi-
  viscous condition, various expedients were used. The one
  which succeeded best was to keep the surface covered with a
  stratum, half a centimetre thick, of ground arc-light carhon.
      The greatest difficulty experienced was due to the action of
  the tin on the porcelain tubes. They would not stand repeated
  heatings in the tin bath, but became very rotten. Several of
  the observations were spoiled by the tubes breaking at the
  moment of removing them from the molten tin. It was
   sometimes difficult at first to remove the pyrometer-tubes,
   because of the oxidized tin on the surface. After the difficulty
   of oxidation was overcome, less trouble was experienced, but
   the tubes were never used more than two or three times with
   out becoming so affected at the junction with the surface of
   the tin, as to make it undesirable to use them again. In taking
   the melting-point of silver, the tubes which had been pre
   viously used for only one set of observations in tin, generally
   broke when removing them from the melted silver, though
   the greatest care was exercised.
       (5. Results of Observations. — Four different samples of
   ordinary platinum wire were compared with a very pure
   specimen in general use in the laboratory as a standard, be
   tween 400° 0. and 1000° C, the two extremes of the furnace
    used. The temperature-coefficient of the standard wire was
    found to be slightly different in different pyrometers. These
    variations were due doubtless to the lack of absolute uniformity
    in the wire, but were not sufficiently large to affect the read
    ings of temperatures at 1000° by more than 1/10 of a degree.
    The difference-coefficient d of each wire in the formula (2)
    was calculated from an observation of the boiling-point of
    sulphur in the usual way.

nates, the differences P<' — P<°, the difference-curve belonging
to each wire being denoted by the value of its d. It will be
seen that the difference-curves are all nearly straight, between
the limits of observation. It follows that a linear relation,
involving only two unknown quantities, will oxpress the rela
 tion of any one of them to the standard, thus :—
                              pt —pt' = a pt + b,
 which may be written, if a is small,
                              pt=pt' + apt' + b                       (4)
      By observing therefore the differences between the platinum
 temperatures of the wires for two points, such as the S.B.P.
 and the Ag F.P., the constants in formula (4) can be found
  for each wire.

       Since the differences are so small between the different
   wires, the platinum temperatures observed with each wire
  can be easily reduced to the scale of the standard wire by the
   linear formula (4), and then corrected by the standard
   difference-curve to the scale of the gas-thermometer. The
   results thus obtained would agree within the limits of the
   present series of observations with the Standard Scale recently
   proposed by Callendar (Phil. Mag. Dec. 1899), which is based
   on the application of the difference-formula (2) to the pure
   standard wire. In this paper, it is pointed out that in all
   probability the value there given for the melting-point of
   silver, viz. 960° C, is correct to within 1° or 2°, and it is
   suggested that a standard platinum wire be adopted, any other
    wire being referred to it by determining the melting-point
    of silver or gold, and the boiling-point of sulphur. To
    the evidence there adduced might be added the redeter
    mination of the melting-points of gold and silver, by

                  Comparison of Platinum Thermometers.                     429
 M. Berthelot, who gives the two points as 962c C. and
  1064° 0. It seems to be a reasonable conclusion, therefore,
  that from 0° up to the melting-point of gold, 10(50°, at least,
  a practical thermometric scale could be established, which
  would at no point differ from the gas-thermometer scale by
  more than 2 or 3°. It would follow that all observers
 working with platinum pyrometers could, in a most certain
 and ready manner, compare their results. The standard
  sample would thus be defined as a wire with a definite sulphur
  boiling-point, and a definite silver melting-point. In fact a
  number of definite points could be defined up the scale, any
  two of which could be used.
      I have not yet carefully studied the difference below 400°
 or above 1000°, but hope to do so in the near future. It
  would appear, however, from results obtained, that the linear
  difference-curve commences to bend below 400°, meeting
  the reference line at 100° C. Such a process of reduction is
  hardly necessary, however, below 500° C, as in any good
  specimen of platinum wire the temperatures can be reduced
 directly by the difference-formula, using the value of d deter
  mined from the S.B.P.
      7. Variation of Temperature-Coefficients.—Since the differ
 ences between the platinum temperatures of two wires
 depend on the rate of change of the temperature-coefficients
of the wires, the following table may not be uninteresting:—

     It will be observed that the percentage diminution of the
coefficient of each of the wires is nearly the same over the
range 0° to 960° in terms of the fundamental coefficient.

430                    Mr. H. M. Tory on the
It follows that the values of ihe difference-coefficients
obtained by reference to the AgF.P. are nearly the same,
and afford a convenient method of reduction at temperatures
near 1000° C. The S.B.P. difference-coefficients do not give
very good agreement at 1000° C. for impure wires.
   8. Method of Heycock and Neville.—In the simple and
convenient method of reduction employed by Heycock and
Neville, the difference-coefficients for the various pyrometers
are calculated as usual from tbe S.B.P., but tho reduction of
tbe observations from pt to t is effected by means of a single
difference-curve, drawn for the standard wire only, in terms
of pt as abscissa. The platinum temperature pt observed
with any pyrometer is reduced to the normal scale by taking
from the standard curve the difference t—pt corresponding
to the observed value ofpt, and increasing it in the ratio d/d°
of the appropriate difference-coefficient d to the standard d°.
This method does not give absolute agreement with the
difference-formula (2) unless d = d°, but it often appears to
give more consistent results than (2) in the case of impure
wires at 1000° (!., and it is simpler to apply, as it requires
only one difference-curve, which is drawn for the standard
wire.
   The following tables will show how close this agreement is
for three of the wires tested. The first column shows, for each
case, the temperatures for the standard wire corrected by the
difference-formula ; the second, headed Test, shows the corre
sponding values for the impure wire, corrected by Heycock
and Neville's method.

    It will be seen that for the first and third wires the results
are in agreement, almost within the limits of error of observa
tion by direct comparison. In the second wire the agree
ment is not so complete, which is not at all remarkable when
it is observed that the temperature-coefficient of this wire is
33 per cent, less than that of the standard. The fourth wire
(the most impure) does not agree at all when reduced by this
method *.
    9. Effect of Annealing. —As before stated, considerable
changes of zero were found in some of the wires on first
heating them to 1000° for a couple of hours, in one instance
a rise of no less than 2°. In this extreme case, there seems
 to be no reason to doubt that the mica used was largely tho
 cause, as the wire after prolonged use became sliglitly dis
 coloured. A specimen of the mica used was tested chemically
 and found to be slightly acid. The standard wire, which was
 chemically very pure, was also slightly affected in this
 pyrometer; and hence the observations were disregarded.
 Afterwards some white mica was obtained, from the Instru
 ment Co., Cambridge, and when proper precautions were
 taken in winding and annealing, the standard wire never
 showed changes of zero greater than 0°*2 or of F.I.
 greater than 0°*03, after heating to 1000° C. Most of the
 impure wires used, however, showed changes somewhat
 greater than this. In the case of the wire d= 1670, a fall of
  1°*2 was observed in the zero on first annealing at 1000J
  for one hour. This was doubtless due to the fact that, in
  winding the coil, the wire, as bent on the frame, was in a state
  of unequal tension, and when heated to 1000° this was relieved,
  with a consequent fall of zero on cooling. For accurate
  work, too great care cannot be exercised in winding the
  pyrometer-coil. A fall of zero may be easily produced as
  above, or, if the wire be wound too tight originally, a thicken
  ing of the mica may cause a rise of zero, as suggested by
  Heycock and Neville. After the coil is wound, the pyrometer
  should be annealed for some time at a temperature beyond
  that for which it is to be used, and allowed to cool slowly
     * Footnote added by Prof. Callendar.—In order to illustrate the nature
  of the agreement of the observations with the difference-formula and with
  Heycock and Neville's method, I have inserted in fig. 2 a series of points
  representing the values of the differences pt'—pt for a wire d= 1*050 cal
  culated by the two methods, (g by the ditf'erence-formula, 0 by Heycock
  and Neville's method. It will be observed that up to 000 pt both methods
  agree about equally well with the observations. Above 000" the observed
  difference is much less than that calculated by the difference-formula.
  The second method agrees very fairly up to 800°, but tends to diverge
  from the linear formula beyond that point.

432        On the Comparison of Platinum Thermometers.
and equally, before the constants are determined. If the
 pyrometer is used frequently for high temperatures, it is
 occasionally necessary to redetermine the zero in the most
 accurate work to allow for minute progressive strains.
    10. Effect of Wire-drawing. — In order to test the effect
 of the mechanical working of the wire on its thermometric
 scale, I had a piece of wire of diameter 6 mils drawn down
to 4 mils, and a double pyrometer made from these two.
 The wire was softened by passing quickly through a bunsen-
 flame before winding, but not annealed after winding. On
 determining the constants, it was found that the platinum
temperatures for the boiling-point of sulphur differed by
 lo-30. The pyrometer was then heated to 1000° for an
 hour, and slowly cooled, and the constants again determined.
 The wires then agreed at the boiling-point of sulphur to "01
of a degree, and on taking the melting-point of silver a
 proportionately good agreement was obtained. The difference
in the first case was certainly due to insufficient annealing.
The pyrometer was tested again and again, and the results
were always in complete agreement. These observations on
samples of the same wire led to the conclusion that the
constants determined after the high temperatures and not
before, as suggested by Heycock and Neville, should be
used in the calculations (provided that the wire is not strained
in cooling), and this has been uniformly done, but the
difference in any case is very slight.
    The wires used differed greatly in specific resistance. In
all cases, the wires with the smallest temperature-coefficients
had the largest specific resistance, and, with the exception of
No. 4, gave the lowest platinum temperatures. The wire
rf=l"670 had a specific resistance about 30 per cent, greater
than that of the standard, and the others nearly as great, but
the measurements of specific resistance could not be made
very accurately on wires of so small a diameter.
    In conclusion, I must thank Prof. Callendar for kind
assistance, Miss Harriet Brooks, B.A., of the Royal Victoria
College, and Mr. N. M. Yuile, M.Sc, of the Mining Depart
ment, McGill College, for assistance in taking observations.

X LTIT. Notes on Gas- Thermometry. By P. CHAPPUIS, Ph. D„
   Sacant AttarM au Bureau International des Poids et
   Mesures, Sevres, France*.
I. TN a recent research, the results of which have just
     A appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society, Dr. J. A. Harker and the author endeavoured
to compare the indications o£ the platinum resistance-ther
mometer and the normal scale over the range —20° to 600° t.
   Having been led to recognize that hydrogen could not be
employed as thermometric substance on account of its action
on the walls of the glass reservoirs at high temperatures, we
had recourse to a constant-volume nitrogen-thermometer
having an initial pressure slightly under 800 millim., and
assumed provisionally that the thermometric scale of this
instrument represents the normal scale of temperature. It is
of interest to ascertain whether this hypothesis is justified by
the facts, or in other words to determine the divergence of
the constant-volume gas-thermometer from the normal scale
at high temperatures.
             Corrections to the Nitrogen Thermometer.
    Measurements previously made with a constant-volume
nitrogen-thermometer J having an initial pressure of one
                                               1 rfP
 metre have shown that the cofficient p -j- varies to an appre

   t The temperature scale adopted as the standard by the International
 Committee of Weights and Measures is defined as the Centigrade Scale
 of the Hydrogen Thermometer, having as fixed points the temperature
 of melting ice (0°), and that of the vapour of distilled water in ebullition
 (100°) under the normal atmospheric pressure; the hydrogen being taken
 under the manometric initial pressure of one metre of mercury, i. e. at
 7fiO =1-3158 of the atmospheric pressure.

From this expression it appears that the coefficient of dilata
tion of nitrogen diminishes gradually up to about 80°, then
increases very slightly. This increase, which is of the same
order of magnitude as the probable errors, is not in agree
ment with our knowledge of the variations of the coefficients
of gases. It is very probable that the coefficient approaches
a definite limiting value for each initial pressure, which in
this case seems to be attained below 100°. In fact, nitrogen
at 100° behaves like hydrogen at the ordinary temperature,
its compressibility being less than is required by the Bovle-
Mariotte law. It may be seen from the table just given that
this limiting value of the coefficient is approximately
                        08=0-00367 380.
   Assuming this value, it is possible to calculate the fictitious
initial pressure which should have been observed if the
nitrogen had retained down to 0° the properties of a perfect
gas%
   We thus obtain the following relations:
            P(= P0(l + at) ; whence Py = .-^- .
                                              L + at
But from direct observation we have
                     Metre              Metre
                  P0 = l, and Pioo = l 367466,

From these data it is a simple matter to calculate the diver
gences of the nitrogen thermometer from the normal scale
within the interval covered by our comparisons.

               500                            -0-068
 From this it would appear that the pressures indicated by a
constant-volume gas-thermometer are a little too low, but
the errors are small and appear to be of less account than
other sources of uncertainty which enter into the measure
 ments. Besides I would remark that in our comparisons of
 the platinum-thermometer with the nitrogen-thermometer, the
 initial pressure was always less than one metre. (In the
 comparisons between 100° and 200° it was 793 millim , and in
 those between 250° and 500° it was always less than 550
 millim.) Under these conditions the systematic divergences
 of the nitrogen scale from the normal are probably diminished
 in the same proportion as the initial pressures. They will
 then be less than 0o-04 for measurements at temperatures near
 the boiling-point of sulphur.
             II. Determination of the Sulphur-Point.
    The mean result of our experiments for the determination
 of this important point is
                             Ts = 445°-2
 under the barometric pressure of 760 millim. Messrs. Calen
 dar and Griffiths, employing the constant-pressure air-
 thermometer, have found for the same point
                             T8=444°53.
 The difference between these two results—0 7— is, I believe,
 to be attributed to the joint action of several causes :—
     (1) The scale of the constant-pressure nitrogen-thermometer
 diverges more widely from the normal temperature-scale than

  436          Ur. P. Chappuis on Gas- Thermometry.
 that of the constant-volume thermometer. From experiments
  made at the Bureau International in 1888*, it would appear
 that the divergences of the former are about double the latter.
  Reduction to the normal scale would raise the result of
  Messrs. Callendar and Griffiths at least a tenth of a degree.
     (2) The coefficient of expansion of air at constant pressure,
  determined by Messrs. Callendar and Griffiths and used by
 them in the determination of their temperatures, is
                              « = 0-003 6749.
 This coefficient is very sensibly greater than that obtained
 for air under similar conditions of pressure by Regnault, who
  found
                             a = 0-003 6700 ;
 or the result given by my own more recent experiments,
                             *= 0-003 6708.
  If in the calculation of Callendar and Griffiths's experiments
 they had taken the latter value,
                             «= 0-003 6708,
 their value for the boiling-point of sulphur would become
 445°0 instead of 444°3.
     (3) A possible cause of part of the divergence may also be
 sought in one of the elements entering into one of the cor
 rections involved in the determination of temperatures with
 the gas-thermometer, namely, the dilatation of the material
 of the reservoir, discussed at some length by Prof. Callendar
 in a recent article in this magazine, vol. xlviii. p. 542.
    It is customary to express this dilatation by a function of
 the form
                           vt=v0(l + cit + /3t*),
 in which a and /3 are constants.
    The determination of the constant a is of no great im-
porance in the measurement of temperatures by the gas-
thermometer.
    The value of a only affects the value obtained for the co
efficient of the dilatation of the gas, It is, however, other
wise with the coefficient /S, the influence of which increases
with increase of temperature. (See in this connexion,
Callendar, loc. cit. p. 544.)
    Of the methods actually employed for the determination of
coefficients of expansion, the most precise is undoubtedly
            • Proces-verbaxtx dee stances de 1888, p. 98 et eej.

that o£ Fizeau. But up to the present no experiments have
been made by this method above 100°.
    It follows that coefficients deduced from experiments made
with this apparatus are only rigorously applicable over the
range 0°-100°*; and it may justly be" objected that extra
polation to 450° might introduce into the results quite sensible
errors. The dilatation of Berlin porcelain, which is the
material out of which the reservoirs employed for the higher
temperature work were made, was determined bv me over the
interval 0°-100°. I found for the cubical dilatation
             i>,= y0(l + 8-0703 x l(r6< + 8-98x lO"9*2).
    The importance of the second term is easily seen. It is
sufficient to note here that if, instead of this expression, we
take
                     vt=r0(l + 8-96835 x 10-6<)
 (which is the mean coefficient between 0° and 100°), we should
have for the sulphur boiling-point
                                T.=444-3
instead of the value 445#2, which results from our calculation.
     Mr. Bedford has recentlv published in this Journal t the
 results of a determination of the dilatation of a tube of
Bayeux porcelain, obtained by a method previously employed
by Callendar and Griffiths.
    The porcelain tube, which served for Mr. Bedford's mea
surements, had external and internal diameters of 17 mm.
 and 10 min. respectively. Near the ends were two marks,
 91 '4 cm. apart, made by a diamond. The variations in the
 distance apart of these two marks were measured by a com
 parator provided with two microscopes under which could
 be brought successively the porcelain tube and a glass tube
 maintained at constant temperature.
     The porcelain tube could be heated to any temperature
 between 0° and 840°, which was measured by the change of
    * The fundamental study of the dilatation of the three screws of the
 platinum-indium tripod, which constitute the standard to which all
 measurements with this npparatus are referred, was made with great care
 by M. Benoit, the Director of the Bureau International, and is described
 in full in the Trav. el Mim. t. vi., 1888. This laborious piece of work,
 which is attended with peculiar difficulties, would have to be extended
 to higher temperatures, if it were desired to extend upwards the range
 over which the Fizeau apparatus can be employed.

resistance of a platinum wire traversing the whole length
of the tube and furnished with Calendar's compensating
leads.
    The observations, which are given in detail in the paper,
led Mr. Bedford to the following expression for the cubical
dilatation of Bayeux porcelain:—
                 vt=v0(l + 10275* + 3-24*2)10~9.
    Treating the same observations by least squares, I found
the slightly different result
                 v, = r0(l + 97 1 5- 6< + 4430 10-».
    Or, if the temperatures thus found on Callendar's scale are
 reduced to the new scale on which our experiments arc
 calculated :—
                 t,<=«0(l-!-978l-4< + 4-276*!!)10-9.
    The incontestable advantage of the method employed by
 Mr. Bedford is that it allows the determination of the dila
 tation over the same temperature range as the thermometer
 reservoir is subsequently to be employed ; but nevertheless
 the fact cannot be ignored that to obtain very exact results
 by a process of this kind must be a matter of extreme
 difficulty.
     I would first remark that the marks made on the tube are
 more than 8 millim. distant from the neutral plane; and under
 these conditions the mode of support of the tube must neces
 sarily exercise a considerable influence on the results obtained.
 And, further, apart altogether from the inevitable variations
 in the distance between the supports, produced by the ex
 pansion of the medium in which they rest, we have the
 possibility of sensible variations in the elastic constants of
  porcelain, as yet undetermined at high temperatures.
     From the author's indications it would seem that during
 the experiments the porcelain tube suffered a perceptible
 change of form. Further, the homogeneity of tubes of this
 kind is often somewhat doubtful, particularly when, like
  Mr. Bedford's, they are glazed. I have the advantage of
 possessing a specimen of Mr. Bedford's tube, obtained by the
  kindness of Prof. Callendar. The hole through it is consi
  derably eccentric, so that opposite parts of the wall present
 variations in thickness of from 2 to 4 millim. The glaze
 having a coefficient of expansion probably differing slightly
  from that of the mass, it seems quite possible that the tube

              pr. P. Chappuis on Gas- Thermometry.                     439
 might become slightly deformed on heating. In that case,
 once the scratches on it are not strictly in the plane of the
 neutral fibres, every variation in the curvature of the tube
 involves a change in the distance apart of the marks.
    Under these conditions it would appear to me that
 Mr. Bedford's results, in spite of their real value, should not
 be accepted without reserve ; and consequently I cannot
 wholly accept the conclusions of Prof. Callendar, who, after
 having compared the coefficients determined by me between
 0° and 100 for " verre dur " and porcelain with those ob
 tained by the method just described, is of opinion that my
 values of /8 are too large.
    Bayeux porcelain having probably a composition differing
 slightly from that of Berlin, I thought it worth while to
 make a determination in the Fizeau apparatus on the spe
 cimen of Mr. Bedford's tube, which I had obtained. The
 specimen as prepared had a length of about 15 mm. The
 upper and lower plane surfaces were polished, and were very
 nearly perpendicular to the axis of the tube. The accom
 panying figure represents the aspect of the fringes * of
 sodium light on this specimen in the first experiment made
 at 83°-3. At each steady temperature an estimate was made
 of the positions of each of the points A, B, C, D, E, F marked
 on the lens with reference to the fringes, which were numbered
 from the centre of the system outwards.
    The irregularity of section of the tube and the defects in
the surface as ground and polished, have rendered it impos
sible to operate on a larger number of points of reference.
    The set comprising 33 separate observations, spaced out
over the interval 1° to 83° gave for the linear dilatation of
 porcelain
                 ^='o(l + (2824-l< + 6-17<2)10-9),

   On comparing this result with that obtained by Mr. Bedford,
it will be seen that the coefficient of the term in t1 is here
about four times us great. It is also about twice as great as
that obtained formerly for Berlin porcelain (8-98 X 10~9).
   If we recalculate the last experiments made by the Fizeau
apparatus, assuming the values of the coefficients as found by
Mr. Bedford, we obtain the following numbers, alongside
of which 1 have placed the values deduced from my ob
servations:—

   The divergences Obs. — Calc. are so large as to be quite in
explicable by errors of observation, since in my experiments
the largest residual errors are very rarely as much as a tenth
of a fringe. It would appear, then, that there is an incom
patibility between the two results, at least over the range of
temperature covered by both. But the measurements on the
Fizeau apparatus have revealed a fact, which 1 have mentioned
already and which. I think, is likely to be the principal
cause of the difference between us. On summarizing in
tabular form the displacements of the fringes, as measured
with regard to the different points of reference, it is evident
at once that the thick part of the tube expands less than the
thinner part.
   If the dilatation of the tube were uniform over its whole
cross-section, the differences between the readings obtained
for the different points should be the same at all temperatures.
 But if, in this case, we take for two widely differing tem
 peratures the differences from the mean for the six points

   The observations made at intermediate temperatures con
firm the rotation of the fringes indicated by the two series
jnst quoted; and since, in the course of the observations, the
direction of the temperature-change was varied frequently,
the fact just mentioned seems well established.
   The inequality in the dilatation of the two opposite sides of
the tube necessarily involves a change in its form. The
tube curves on expansion, which is probably the cause of the
divergence found between Mr. Bedford's results and mine.
   The conclusions of the study made by Dr. Harker and
myself of the thermometric scale of the platinum-resistance
thermometer and the sulphur-point do not appear to me to be
invalidated by the results collected by Prof. Oallendar, and
 I think we are justified in adhering to them, whilst recog
nizing at the same time the uncertainty which attaches to an
application of the coefficient of expansion of the reservoir
over an interval about four times as great as that in which it
was determined, and where alone it is strictly applicable.

-*- 1. ' The Igneous Rocks of the Coast of County Waterford.'
By F. R. Cowper Reed, Esq., M.A., F.G S.
   The first part of this paper is devoted to a discussion of the field-
evidence, as shown by the coast-sections from Newtown Head to
Stradbally. The igneous rocks there exposed are divided into the
following five categories :— (a) The felsitic rocks ; (6) necks of non-
volcanic materials ; (c) the basic sills and vents ; (<Z) intrusions of
dolerite ; («) intrusions of trachyte, andesite, etc. ; (/) intrusions of
other types. In regard to the age of the rocks, there appear to
have been two main periods of volcanic activity : the first, in
Ordovician times, was marked solely by outpourings of a felsitic
nature; the second, post-Ordovician but pre -Upper -Old- Red -
Sandstone, was characterized by a succession of several distinct
types of igneous rocks. The lavas and tuffs, interbcdded with
fossiliferous rocks, have been already described. These are overlain
by other felsites and ashes, developed near Great Newtown Head,
which show the same dip and strike and partake in the same move
ments. Next occurred an outburst of green and pink felsites, tuffs
and coarse agglomerates, developed from Great Newtown Head to
Garrarus ; and possibly the xenolithic felsites and greenish tuffs
belong to the same series. It is doubtful whether these were
poured out before the first folding of the Ordovician beds, but their
strike, when traced inland, agrees with that of the series last
mentioned. The intrusion of some irregular masses of felsite-
porphyry took place subsequently to the folding ; it was followed
by small veins of trachyte and andesite ; these by basic sills,
diabases, etc., and by a few dolerite-dykes and veins. Subsequently
the igneous intrusions assumed an acid character, and the fekitin
masses of Newtown Head, Knockmahon, etc. were extruded ;
probably at this time, too, were formed the isolated necks filled with
brecciated fragments of the earlier rocks. The felspar-porphyry
dykes and isolated felsitic sheets and veins which pierce the folded
rocks, particularly west of Kilfarrasy, probably belong to this lato
period.
   The relative age of some of tho peculiar types of intrusive
 rocks is indicated in the paper in those cases in which it can be
determined. That those rocks which are later in date than the
 folding of the Ordovician are older than the Upper Old Red
 Sandstone is shown (1) by the unconformity of the Upper Old Red

444                       Geological Society.
Sandstone ; (2) by the fact that the latter rock does not contain any
interbedded igneous rocks ; and (3) by the absence of felsitic or other
 intrusive rocks from the Old Red Sandstone of the district.
    The second part of the paper is devoted to petrological notes on
 the different rock-types. The fclsites are classified by means of
 their groundmass into microcrystalline, cryptocrystalline, and micro-
 poikilitic and other types; potash-felsites, potash-soda-felsites, and
 keratophyres, all appear to be present ; some of these rocks are linked
 to the trachytes and bostonites. The diabases and dolerites are
 sometimes ophitic, but more usually allotriomorphic in texture.
 The trachytes and andesites are of various types, and some are
 probably keratophyres.       Quartz- and felspar-porphyries, augite-
 porphyrites, and several miscellaneous types are also described.
    2. ' On a Xew Type of Rock from Keutallen and Elsewhere, and
 its Relations to other Igneous Rocks in Argyllshire.' By J. B. Hill,
 Esq., R.N., and II. Kynaston, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
     A rock originally described by Mr. Teall from Kentallen is used
 by the authors as a type round which they group a peculiar series
 of basic rocks discovered in several localities. The rocks consist
 essentially of olivine and augite with smaller amounts of orthoclase,
 plagioclase, and biotite, while apatite and magnetite are accessory.
 The peculiar feature of the rocks is the association of alkali-felspar
 with olivine and augite, and the group is related to the shonkinite
 of Montana and the olivine-monzonitc of Scandinavia. The occur
 rence of the rocks is connected with four neighbouring but distinct
 areas of intrusion, each characterized by granites and diorites, and
 by dykes and sills of lamprophyres, porphyrites, etc. In these areas
 the new rock is the most basic type, and it occurs iu the marginal
 portions of the areas. Close relationships exist between the different
 intrusive rocks in each area, so that it may be concluded that these
  constitute a ' rook-series ' ranging from granite through augite-
 diorite towards the olivine-bearing rocks, in the plutonic phase, and
  from orthoclase-porphyry and porphyrite to augite-lamprophyre, in
  the dyke-and-sill phase. The whole assemblage appears to have
 been derived by a process of differentiation from one parent magma;
  and the order of intrusion has been, in the main, one of increasing
  acidity. There is further a ' facies-suit ' in each intrusion showing
  progressive increase in basicity from centre to magma, due to con
 centration of the more basic oxides in the cooler portions of the
 magma, which was originally of intermediate composition ; from
 this ' complementary rocks ' were produced. It is extremely probable
 that the underlying magmas of the four intrusive areas resembled one
 another more or less closely in composition.

    XLV. On the Action of the Coherer. By T. MiztJNO *.
SINCE the discovery that when a metallic powder is ex
      posed to the influence of electric radiation its electric
resistance undergoes alteration, many investigators have
attacked the problem by various methods. It is, however,
not necessary to mention one by one all the names of the
investigators and the results at which they have arrived. It
may suffice to notice that the results tend to show that the
action of the coherer is correlated in some way to microscopic
sparks induced in an assemblage of fine metallic particles in
virtue of the action of electric waves ; that is to say, these
sparks might give rise to "welding" action, whereby con
ducting chains of particles are formed, and consequently the
resistance of the coherer greatly reduced.
   Now the author thought that in order to make the so-called
welding-theory more definite, a thorough systematic study of
the subject was necessary, and also that such study might add
some interesting facts to our knowledge of the action of the
coherer. Accordingly a series of experiments was undertaken
 on a number of metals, some alloys, and also their mixtures.
 The experiments were conducted in the following manner :—
    The source of electric waves was a Hertzian parabolic
 vibrator, emitting electric waves of about 60 cms. wave
 length. The coherer consisted of a glass tube about 5 cms.
 in length, 5 mms. in diameter, having two movable and
 finely-adjustable small pistons, between which the metallic
 powder under question could be introduced. To the ex
 tremities of the pistons were respectively attached wires

446         T. Mizuno on the Action of tlie Coherer.
which led to the arms of a Wheatstone's bridge. The gal
vanometer used was a Kelvin's astatic double-coil one. The
bridge-current was supplied by a single Daniell cell, the
resistance, ranging between 1000 and 2000 ohms, being
always inserted in the circuit before the current entered the
arms of the bridge. This precaution was, as I found, es
pecially requisite, because when the current exceeded a
certain strength, the resistance of the coherer often underwent
very marked spontaneous fluctuations during the repeated
processes for balancing the bridge. This phenomenon was
perhaps due to the self-induction effectof the galvanometer-coil.
   Taking the above precaution, I have made a general
survey of metals, some alloys, and their mixtures. So far as
I am aware, all the investigators of the coherer simply
measured the change of its resistance under the action of a
given electric radiation, but did not, any of them, go so far
as to examine the successive states of affairs under repeated
radiations. My method of procedure was entirely different,
and I studied the history, so to speak, of the successive
changes of the resistance of the coherer accompanying suc
cessive oscillating sparks of the Hertzian vibrator. The
results obtained with the several metals, alloys, and their
mixtures respectively are tabulated and also plotted in the
following tables and diagrams :—

   In the above tables the first columns show the number of
sparks, and the other columns give the successive values of
the resistance of the several coherers respectively. Here by
" number of sparks " I mean the number of the oscillating.

sparks counted from the first, so that the number simply gives
the historical stage of the successive sparks. It is also to be
remarked that the signs of inequality and approximate equality
are used in Table IV. to indicate the relative quantities of the
constituent metals.          Fig. 2.

458         T. Mizuno on the Action of the Coherer.
  The chief results obtained from the above experiments may
now be summed up as follows-:—
   (1) In platinum, lead, nickel, aluminium, cadmium, copper,
       silver, steel, and potassium coherers, the action of
       electric waves is to reduce their resistances at first to
       a large extent, and then this reduction continues,
       though with some intermediate rise and full, until the
       resistances assume certain final values.
   (2) In the case of iron, tin, bismuth, zinc, and antimony
       coherers, their resistances are diminished at first, but
       soon afterwards the changes become very irregular, the
       diminution and increase occurring at random. It is
       very interesting and also important to notice that with
       the iron coherer the action is conspicuously irregular.
  (3) With one and also two small lead-ball coherers, the
        resistance attains its final value very rapidly, so that
        the successive stages of their histories present nothing
        conspicuous.
  (4) In the alloys, namely german-silver, brass, electric
        fuse, ordinary soldering fuse, Rose's and Wood's metals,
        the general tendency is to the reduction of their resist
       ances to certain limiting values, though with more or
        less irregularity.
   (5) In the case of the coherers with the mixed metals,
        namely iron with silver, cadmium, Rose's and Wood's
        metals respectively, and also silver with Wood's metal,
        the mode of change of resistance seems to be chiefly
        foverned by the percentage ratios of the constituents,
         n fact, the history of each coherer, as will be seen
        from the figures, presents the character which would
        belong to the predominating constituent.
   (6) With zinc, lead, potassium, and electric fuse, we find
        that the resistance suddenly assumes infinite value at a
        certain stage during the experiment.
   Judging from the above results, it appears to me that the
action of the coherer might, in reality, be due to something
like welding which would take place on a small scale among
fine metallic particles in virtue of the induced microscopic
sparks. In fact I found that the lowering of resistance seems
to be greatly determined by the melting-point of each metal
and alloy ; that is to say, the lower the melting-point the
greater the reduction is.
   Of course it is here to be remembered that evidently this
reduction also depends upon the specific electric conductivity.
   For example, in the case of very easily fusible metals,
namely, Wood's and Rose's metals, the reduction comes out

             T. Mizuno on tlie Action of the Coherer.       459
rather smaller than expected ; and this is perhaps due to the
comparatively bad electric conductivities or the metals. Now
according to the above-assumed theory of welding, it follows
naturally that such a metal, possessing good electric con
ductivity while at the same time its melting-point is not very
high, would suffer a marked reduction in its resistance. The
experimental results, so far as I have found out, seem to point
to such a conclusion. It was thought tbat it would be inter
esting to ascertain whether the behaviour of coherers can be
modified freely by properly mixing one kind of metallic
powder with another, or not. To do this it is natural to select
metals whose behaviours are very marked, that is to say, those
metals which are either very irregular or very smooth in their
action under the influence of electric radiations. In this
respect iron belongs to the first, while silver, cadmium,
Rose's and Wood's metals belong to the second class. Hence,
as shown in the foregoing Table IV., the iron powder was
respectively coupled with the just-mentioned metals, and also
the couple of the two, so to speak, inactive metals, that is
silver and Wood's metal, was formed.
   Experimenting on such mixed coherers, the author found
that the irregularity in the behaviour of iron could be actually
smoothed at will by taking a greater mass of the coupled
metal. Again, here I have to draw attention to the fact that
with all the metals and alloys investigated the resistance did
not necessarily undergo diminution, but often increased during
the experiment; and also that in the case of some metals and
alloys the increase went up even to infinity.
    How are these phenomena to be accounted for ? Is it not
possible to conceive a state of affairs such that, in one case,
some of the conducting chains once formed by melting dis
integrate, while in the other case the chains, acting somewhat
like fuse, suffer complete break under the impulse of electric
radiations ?
    Of course by "welding " I do not always necessarily mean
electrical welding in its strict sense ; but it might even,
perhaps, be sufficient to simply assume a certain process of
melting in order to account for the said phenomena. Though
 the hidden mechanism of the coherer still remains for further
complete investigation, yet I venture to say that such a
 survey as I have made of the successive stages in the history
 of each of the several coherers appears, at any rate, to be of
no little scientific value.
    Lastly, it is to be noticed that the above experiments were
 performed during the last winter at the Physical Laboratory
 of Kyoto Imperial University, Kyoto, Japan.

         XLV1. The Molecular Constitution of Water.
                   By William Sutherland*.
ri^HE two chief irregularities in the physics of water,.
 J. namely, its temperature of maximum density near the
solidifying point, and its great expansion on solidification,
seem to have long ago suggested the idea that water is a
mixture of two substances, whose proportions vary with the
temperature. In 1892 Rontgen (Wied. Ann. xlv.) in an
elegant but brief paper, showed that qualitatively all the pro
minent exceptional properties of water could be accounted for
by considering water at different pressures and temperatures
to be a saturated solution of ice in some other form of H20.
It seemed to me that sufficient data were in existence to
enable one to work out quantitatively the actual constitution
of water; and I propose to show that steam being H20, ice is
pure (H20)3 and water a mixture of (H20)3 and (H20)2 in
proportions whose dependence on temperature can be ex
pressed by a simple formula. As H20 is very generally used
as a symbol for water, and as hydrogen oxide is a long name
for so important a chemical species as H20, I propose for
international convenience to call H20 hydrol, (H20)2 dihydrol,
and (H20)3 trihydrol. Steam is hydrol, ice is trihydrol, and
water a mixture of dihydrol and trihydrol. The investigation
will be taken in the following order:—
   1. ( Constitution of water from its thermal expansion.
   2. Confirmation from optical refraction.
   8. Compressibility o£ water and dissociation of trihydrol-
into dihydrol by pressure.
   4. Surl'ace-tension and constitution of water in surface-
film.
   5. Latent heat of fusion, specific heat, and latent heat of
evaporation.
   6. The viscosity of water.
   7. Dielectric capacity.
   8. The melting of ice as a phenomenon of dissociation, and
the higher valency of oxygen.
   9. Nummary of results.
     1. Constitution of Water from its Thermal Expansion.
   The starting point in this section is MendelcefFs empirical
approximate formula for the thermal expansion of liquids
between 0°C. and their boiling-points, namely, p = p0(l — kt),
which, expressed graphically, as in the figure, with t for
                   * Communicated by the Author.

            On the Molecular Constitution of Water.        461
abscissa and p for ordinate, gives a straight line such as XY
for an ordinary liquid. But the corresponding graph for
water is like the curve ODE in which the ordinate DN re-
 5resents the maximum density at about 4° C. If the actual
  ata are plotted on a large scale, the branch DB looks as if it
                             Rg.L
approached asymptotically the straight line FG-. The reason
able course is then to assume that this asymptote represents
the behaviour of one of the pure ingredients of water. The
slope of this asymptote gives for k the value -00l, which is
of the same order as k for ordinary liquids, and the asymptote
cuts the axis of p in a point which gives for p0 for the pure
ingredient a value about 1*083.
   G-uided by these facts and by theoretical considerations, I
sought to obtain an equation for CDE which would give the
value of p for the other ingredient, and also a law of the dis
sociation of one ingredient into the other at different tempe
ratures. A preliminary attempt gave a formula which ex
pressed the variation of p with t to within 1 part in 10,000;
but as Mendeltieff (Phil. Mag. [5] xxxiii.) had already
furnished an empirical formula for the expansion of water
correct to 4 parts in 100,000, it seemed best to examine his
formula in the light of the foregoing considerations. It is

To interpret this we must suppose water at 4° C. to be for
the present a standard mixture of the two ingredients in
water, and that water at any other temperature is formed by
adding a certain proportion of one of the pure ingredients to
this standard mixture. Let us denote this standard mixture
by S, its density at any temperature by p„ and at 0° by gp,,
while px and 0pi relate to the pure ingredient which we shall
call 1. Then for a mixture of 1/2 + g parts by weight of S
with i/2—q parts of 1 formed without shrinking, we should
have a density p given by

   The value 1-08942 for up, the density at zero of one of the
pure ingredients agrees with the value indicated by the
asymptote in the figure, and the law of dissociation of our
standard mixture S at different temperatures is given by (6),
to which we shall return when we have determined the com
position of our standard mixture. We shall neglect in it the
small terms and write it
                     *=TOT7t--3207                           <7>
   In this form it gives for a = 1/2, t= —'06° instead of 4°
as the temperature at which the percentage of 1 added to S
is 0 ; this is the result of neglecting the small terms, and is
of no importance in the study of q at present. For y = 0,
that is for a mixture of equal parts of 1 and S, < = 147. The
largest possible negative value of q is when i = x> and is
 — -32, so that obviously the formula does not include in its
range the case of </=— 1/2, that is of the complete dissocia
tion of water into the pure substance 1. Nor should the
formula be expected to do so, as its empirical range is only
to the boiling-point, though it may be used for purposes of
approximation up to nearly 200 degrees.
    To determine the composition of S we shall now consider
another remarkable exceptional property of water, namely,
its large expansion upon solidification. According to Bunsen
unit volume of water at 0° becomes 1*09082 of ice at 0°, and
notwithstanding this considerable forcing apart of the mole
cules of water against their mutual attractions, for which we
should expect that energy would have to be put into water
to solidify it, we find actually that energy or heat has to be
taken out of water to change it to ice. For comparison we
can consider the expansion of metals and phosphorus when
they melt. According to Vicentini and Omodei (Wied. Beibl.
xii.) a volume 1000 of each of the following increase by
         Pb.      (VI.   Sn.    Na.     K.     P.     HK.
         34       47     28     25      26    35      37
   Therefore there is on the average an expansion of such
 solids on melting by 33 per cent., whereas with water there
is a contraction of 8-3 per cent. These facts alone are enough
to suggest that the solidifying of water into ice is no mere
physical change of state, as with most melting bodies, but is
chiefly a profound chemical change. This view of the melt
 ing of ice will be gone into fully in sections i> and 8, and in
the meanwhile we shall assume that water in- solidifying
 changes entirely into its other pure ingredient, which we

464                .     Mr. W. Sutherlaud on the
shall denote by 2. This in its solid form as ice has a density
•91662, and if it could expand without dissociation would
probably expand like a melting metal by about 3 or 4 per
cent., so that the density of our second pure ingredient as a
liquid at 0 ought to be about *88. If, then, this is mixed
with the pure ingredient 1 having density 1*08942 to produce
without shrinkage our standard mixture S of density 1 (nearly)
at 0, it is easy to calculate what part p3 of it by weight has to
be mixed with pk = 1 —p3 of 1 by the equation
                        l=?2/-88 + (l-^s)/l-089,       ....         (8>

       andaU, p3=-375{l/2 + q),                                     (9>
because water at temperature t contains 1/2 + '/ parts of S in
one part of water, and therefore it contains "375 (1/2 + q)
parts of 2 in one part of water, q being 1/2 almost at 0°.
In the following table are given the fraction p3 of in
gredient 2 (trihydrol) in one part of water at different tem
peratures, the values of q according to (7) being also in
cluded.

   In using the formula? to calculate values for 198° we are
extrapolating beyond their proper range, and must take such
values as first approximations only. It is evident from these
numbers that at the critical temperature of water, which is
about 368° C, water must consist of nearly pure ingredient 1
which we shall prove in section 4 to be dihydrol. Now
Thorpe and Riicker have furnished a convenient approximate
relation between the coefficient of expansion of a liquid and
its critical temperature (Journ. Chem. Soc. xliv.), namely,
                              l.,.l-99T.--T

where t'0 and vt are volumes at 0° and t 0., while Tc is the
absolute critical temperature, which for dihydrol is 641. Thusv
then, for this liquid we have
                 3_=-900=l-100/t1,          .-. ^ = -001,

                  Molecular Constitution of Water.           465
which agrees with the value found graphically by means of
the asymptote. Accordingly, from (5) we have k, ='00033.
   But S is a mixture of "375 parts of 2 and "625 of 1, and

   With -00033 as the value of dv/dt at 0°, and the values
of j»i, ,,/Oj, and £„ this wives a negative value for k3. This is
undoubtedly wrong. One cause of the error may be that we
have got too large a value of kx by Thorpe and Riicker's
approximate formula ; another cause may be that 1 and 2 do
not mix without shrinking, as assumed in establishing (B),
a very small change in the neglected shrinkage at different
temperatures would modify considerably the meanings of At
and kt as they appear in (B), which has been forced into the
form of Mendeleeffs empirical equation. Indeed our process
of getting (B) into a form the same as (A) tends to make
the separation of the true coefficients of expansion difficult.
The following method of proceeding for ki and k3 seems safer.
 According to Pliicker and Geissler (Pogg. Ann. lxxxvi.) the
coefficient of cubical expansion of ice is "000157, and according
to Hagen (Wied. Ann. xxxix.) the coefficients of Na and K
on melting increase by '3 of their values; so by analogy we
shall take the coefficient of liquid trihydrol to be about -0002.
With this in (11) and (5) we get A1 = -00076. I shall adopt
•0009 as a reasonable compromise for the value of klt retain
 ing -0002 as the value of k2. This seems small, but as I hope
to show that the melting-point of ice is not the true physical
melting-point of trihydrol, but its temperature of dissociation,
we can take -0002 as the coefficient of trihydrol below its
true melting-point, in solution in dihydrol ; the analogy just
used with melting Na and K was intended to provide an
allowance for increased molecular freedom in the liquid state,
 without implying that the melting of ice is a true physical
melting like that of these metals.
               2. Confirmation from Optical Refraction.
    Before going farther it is important to confirm our con
clusion that water is a mixture of liquids 1 and 2 in propor
 tions given by Table I., and at the present stage an optical
 method is most appropriate. For a mixture of pi parts by
 weight of a liquid of refractive index r?i with ps parts of a

466                   Mr. W. Sutherland on the
liquid of index n2, we have its index n given by the Lorenz-
 Lorentz formula

so that (ft2 — l)/(/i3 + 2)p, say R, is a linear function of p3 ;
therefore we shall tabulate the values of this expression at
different temperatures for water and the values of p3 from
Table I. side by side, and also the values of their respective
successive differences denoted in the next table by AR and
 Ap2. The indexes n for water are those of Ketteler (VVied.
Ann. xxxiii.) and for ice that of Pulfrich (Wied. Arm. xxxiv.),
and the densities are the mean values given by Mendeleeff.

   It will be noticed that the values of A (ft5— l)/(«2 + 2)p
and of A/>2 run a similar course, but that the former tend to
diminish to a 0 value more rapidly than the latter. This is
connected with an interesting fact that water differs from
ordinary liquids in showing a diminution of (n* — i)/(n*+2)p
with rising temperature, whereas it usually increases. Thus
Lorenz (Wied. Ann. xi.) finds it to increase by the following
number of parts in 10,000 for the following liquids from 10
to 20° :— ethyl oxide 8, chloroform 4, ethyl iodide 5, ethyl
acetate 11, carbon disulphide 12. It appears, therefore, that
in water this normal temperature effect of an increase has
superposed on it a diminution due to the changing composi
tion of water; the result being that in water (n2 — l)/(«2-|- 2)p
is nearly stationary at 80° and 100°. In the case of water
then A (ft4 — l)/(rii + 2)p consists of two parts, one propor
tional to increase of temperature At like those just given for
ordinary liquids, and the other proportional to A;>2, thus
         A(ft*-l)/(na + 2)/>=-00000515At + -00534A^S,
                                                                          ,

                 Molecular Constitution of Water.               467
 Ap2 being negative when denoting a diminution. The values
 of AR marked " calculated " in the last table are derived
 from the values of Ap3 by this, formula. Ketteler considers
his values of n reliable to within a few units in the fifth decimal
 place, which implies that we should not have given the values
 of 10° B, to more than five figures, and should not expect our
values of 106AR, as calculated, to agree closer than within a
few units in the tens place of digits with the found values, as
the table shows to be actually the case. Thus for the two
ingredients of water the temperature effect for 10° seems to
be an increase of about 2*5 parts in 10,000, and with this
taken into account the composition of water as determined
optically is in agreement with that found from its expansion.
For (ns-l)/(n2 + 2)p for 2 (trihydrol) and 1 (dihydrol) we
have by (13) the values
                   •20968      and      -20434.
   3. Compressibility of Water and Dissociation of Trihydrol
                    into Dihydrol by Pressure.
    One of the peculiarities of water is that its compressibility
at low pressures diminishes with temperature to a minimum
and then increases. Denoting volume of a gramme by v we
can write the mixture formula for volume
                           v=p1v1+piv2,                        (14)

    In this equation we have dv/df from the experimental com

remain three unknowns dv^/df, dv2/df, and dp2/df3 and their
variations with temperature are also unknown. To get
farther it is necessary that we should estimate the compres
sibilities of our two ingredients. I propose to do this for 1
(dihydrol) in the following manner. In " The Laws of Mole
cular Force " (Phil. Mag. [5J xxxv.) I have shown that within
a limited range of temperature and pressure the characteristic
equation for liquids is such that
                     ^TX=^~"ErT                                (16)

468                 Mr. W. Sutherland on the
the substance, and R the usual constant for it when a perfect
gas, T the absolute temperature. Thanks to Amagat's in
valuable supply of data (Ann. de Ch. et de Phys. [6] xxix.),
I have been able to find an equation of more extensive range,
but as this is still in manuscript, I shall use here the pub
lished equation referred to. In that paper, p. 276, values of
M8/ for water are given, M being the molecular mass which
for H20 is 18. With the dyne as unit of force these are
 11 X 10" from the latent heat of vaporization, 9 x 1013 from
the critical data, and 6 x 10u from the capillary data. The
last value was obtained on the assumption that in water the
molecules consist of (H20)2, but M in M?l is only 18. As
 the latent heat of vaporization of water includes also the heat
of dissociation of its complex molecules, and as the critical
pressure probably lias its value seriously affected by dissocia
tion, the value 6 x 1012 roust be the most nearly correct, as I
have hitherto always treated it to be. Then changing to the
atmo as the unit of pressure, when RT at 0° C. has the value
11200/9, we get for (H20)2 or 1 at 0°
                         vT'lt =12790,

using the value of ku namely '0009, we have for the calcu
lated compressibility of 1 at 06 the value "000016. Similarly
at 50° we get '0000235. For higher temperatures it seems
 to me safest to proceed thus. According to van der Waals's
principle of correspondence, the compressibilities of 1 aud of
ethyl oxide at low pressures will always be in the same ratio
to one another if taken for comparison at temperatures which
<ire equal fractions of their absolute critical temperatures.
 We may take the absolute critical temperature of 1 as the
same as that of water, namely 641, and that of ethyl oxide
as 468. In the next table are given certain temperatures C
lor 1 and the temperatures C for ethyl oxide which correspond
to these ; then the compressibilities of ethyl oxide at these
temperatures, and finally the compressibilities of 1 (dihydrol)
calculated from those for ethyl oxide on the principle that
the ratio at all the corresponding temperatures is that which
holds for 1 at 50° and ethyl oxide at —37°, obtained by
extrapolation from Amagat's data from 0° to 200° between
50 and 100 atmos.

   It should be noticed that the compressibility we have
calculated for 1 at 198° is nearly the same as that found by
Amagat for water at 198°, at which temperature it ought to
be nearly all 1 ; this, therefore, confirms our calculated com
pressibilities for 1. The numbers of the last row are made
up of two parts, p^di'-Jdf and (t>s — Vi)dp2/df. Now p2 has a
v;ilue, '375 at 0°, which falls to "217 at 100°, so that these
numbers may be said to include on the average about \ of
dvt/df for 2. But for a substance so near its solidifying-
point as 2 is at these temperatures, '00001 would be a reason
able allowance for dvjdf at 0°, and as dvjdf increases while
pt diminishes with rising temperature, "000003 may be used
as an approximate value of ptdrt'df, at all temperatures up
to 100°. As we now can calculate v.2 and i>i at all tempera
tures, we have Vt— vL as given in the next table, and therefore
dpt/df given in the last row.

   We have thus obtained estimates of the rate at which a
gramme of 2 (trihydrol) is dissociated by pressure at different
temperatures, namely, '00017 gramme per atmo at 0° and
"0001 gramme per atmo at 100°.

470                    Mr. W. Sutherland on the
   We can study this dissociation from a slightly different
point of view. Amagat's data {Ann. de Ch. et tie Ph. [6]
xxix.) enable us to assign the temperature of maximum
density of water under 150 atmos as -5°. Although his
pressures go up to 3000 atmos the maximum density has not
been ascertained by him at a higher pressure than 150 atmos.
Accordingly I have found the equation like Mendeleeff's
which will represent the expansion of water under 150 atmos.
With the volume of a gramme of water at 4° and under
1 atmo as unity it is
  -i^7«/'u.«!Hi                  '087724         -67584      \   ,p.
   The volumes of a gramme of water as given by this formula
and by Amagat, when we have changed his unit of volume to
that just mentioned, are :—
                               Table V.
      t.          0°     20°     40°   60°     80°      100°     198°

   Up to 100° the equation represents the actual data with a
 maximum error of 2 parts in 100,000, the comparison for
 198° being added to show how far the form fails when applied
 much beyond the ordinary boiling-point.
    On comparing this last equation with Mendeleeff's for one
 atmo (A) and with (B). we see how the terms expressing ex
 pansion of the two ingredients and dissociation have got
 mixed up; a result always to be feared with empirical equa
 tions, which fact indeed makes it appear a happy accident
 that Mendeleeff's formula (A) is capable of such easy inter
 pretation. We have now to disentangle the mixed up parts
 of the last equation. It relates to p of 1 mixed with 1 —p parts
 of a mixture which we shall denote by S' (different from S).
 The density of S' is l-00747, and therefore its volume is
 •99259, and the volume of 1 (dihvdrol) as a liquid, being
 1/1-08942 at 0° under 1 atmo, is -91572 under 150 atmos
 when the compressibility -000016 is taken into account.
 Now S' also contains 2 under 150 atmos ; under 1 atmo at
 0 it was taken to have a volume 1/-88, and the compressibility
 •00001 was conceded to it, so that its volume at 0° under
 150 atmos is 1-13466; and applying the mixture formula to
 the density of S' we have
              •99259 = -91572 + (1-13466—91572)p2)

    Under one atmo we found p3 = -375 at 0°, so that at this
temperature dpz/df= "024/149 = -0001(i, in fair agreement, as
it ought of necessity to be, with the value found from com
 pressibilities, namely, -00017.
    In order to disentangle the dissociation terms of (0) from
the expansion terms, we must make the dissociation produced
by pressure at the different temperatures run a similar course

    If the values just found for dp^/df hold up to pressures at
which the whole of 2 is dissociated, it appears that at
•375/-00016 or about 2300 atmos the whole of the 2 (tri
hydrol) will be dissociated at 0° ; at 100° the pressure of
complete dissociation would be -217/-000093, also about
2300 atmos. These results agree well with Amagat's con
clusion that at high pressures, even below 3000 atmos, the
irregularities of water disappear; water becomes an ordinary
liquid, that is to say, the mixture of 2 and 1 has been con
verted into pure compressed 1.
    The effect of pressure in dissociating 2 has an important
bearing on the composition of the surface-film of water. If
pressure causes dissociation, tension may be expected to pro
duce association, and therefore we may expect the proportion

   472                  Mr. W. Sutherland on tJie
   of 2 to be higher in the surface than in the body of water.
   This will now be discussed in the next section.
               4. Surface-tension and Constitution of Water
                              in Surface-film.
       The relation which I have shown to exist between the
   aurface-tension a of a mixture and those of its ingredients
    (Phil. Mag. [5] xxxviii., xl.) is approximately
                     "i/p=Pi*iJP\+Pi*2i/P2>                          (20)

       We have also Eotvos's discovery (Wied. Ann. xxvii.) that,
    Mv being the volume of a gramme molecule and a(M»)5 the
    molecular surface-tension a, then dajdt is nearly the same
    for all normal liquids, and retains a nearly constant value up
    to near the critical temperature, while for associated liquids
    of varying degree of association it is not constant. With
    the dyne as unit of force Ramsay and his pupils have found
    a mean value 2*121 for Eotvos's constant dajdt. Ramsay's
    values of a(M.v)l or a with M = 18 for water (Proc. Roy.
    Soc. lvi. p. 177) are given in the next table with a value 0
    inserted for the critical temperature and below them the
    values of lOOAa/A*.

       These values of A«r/A< show no tendency towards becoming
    stationary at near 0°, but let us take "92 as the order of their
    magnitude near 0°. This when multiplied by 3J yields 1*91,
    which is near enough to the 2'121 of a normal liquid to
    suggest that the surface-film of water at 0° consists of
     (H20)s. But if this is so we should also multiply by
     (1/*88)1, where *88 is the density of our ingredient 2, and
    this brings 1*91 up to 2*08, which is still nearer the result
    for an average liquid. There is, therefore, fair evidence that
    the tension in the surface-layer of water at 0° is sufficient to
    <-ause practically the whole of the water there to change into
     trihydrol, whose surface-tension is that of water at 0C, namely,
    73-32 dynes per centim., and then by Eotvos's relation the
    surface-tension of trihydrol at any other temperature is given

    It appears from this table that up to 40° the surface-film
of water consists of pure trihydrol (Hs0)3, but that at 60°
and higher temperatures the surface-tension is so much re
duced as to allow some of liquid 1 to form. Now at 40° the
surface-tension is 67-56 dynes per centim., and in the body-
 water the amount of 1 per gramme is *716, and the value of
dpjdf at 40° is •000.1315, and therefore the tension per square
 centim. required to convert this amount of 1 into trihydrol
will be -716/-000133 or 5380 atmos. Therefore tho thickness
of the surface-film (defined below) is
              67-56/538 x 107= 12-6 X 10~9 centim.
    Now Kelvin's estimate of the order of magnitude of
 ordinary molecular diameters is 2 x 10-9 centim., so that our
 surface-film would be only a few molecules thick. Thi*
agrees with what I have suggested as to the thickness of the
surface-film according to the law of the inverse fourth power
for molecular attraction. Of course with such a law of force
 it is impossible that there can be any natural boundary
between surface-film and body of fluid, and it is obvious that
the tension must bo greatest in the first layer of molecules
on the surface ; in the tenth layer we can imagine the at
tractions of the eleventh to the eighteenth equilibrating those
 of the first nine, and the dissymmetry causing tension in our
 tenth layer is only that due to a mass which begins at nine
 times the molecular diameter away ; the effect of this must
 be very small compared to the effect of dissymmetry in the
 condition of the first layer. The thickness of the surface-
 film D can be most rationally defined as twice the distance
 of the centre of tension from the surface, in symbols
                           T>$fdl=2$fldl,
where / is tension per unit area at depth I from the surface.

Above we have found /= 5380 atmos and
                        D = 12-6xl0-9 centim.
   We can now calculate px in equation (21), that is the
amount of 1 in one gramme of the surface-film. For if we
divide the surface-tensions of water at different temperatures
by 12*6 x 10-9, we get the average tensions per unit area in the
surface-film as given in the table below. But if wre divide
the values of p\, derived from those of pt in Table I., by the
values of dp2/df at the same temperatures from Table VII.,
we get the tension required to convert all of 1 in the body of
the water into trihydrol in the surface-film. The difference
between the former tension and the latter, expressed as a frac
tion of the latter, gives that fraction of jt>, which has not been
converted into trihydrol, so that if we multiply this fraction
by px for the body of the liquid, we get pi for the surface-
film as required in equation (21), and as given in the next
table along with the derived values of *x.

the critical temperature of water 368° C. is that of 1, and
therefore «i(18//3i)1 and a^G/pj)' must both vanish at about
368°; so that on dividing their values tabulated above by
308, 288, and 268 respectively, we should get much more
reliable values of the appropriate coefficients. In this way
for ^(30/p!)5 we get the temperature-coefficients 2*21, 2*19,
and 2*1G, mean 2*19, whereas the mean for the similar co

furnishes our proof that the liquid 1 is dihydrol.
   The exceptional properties of the surface-tension of solu
tions have been discussed in " Molecular Force and the Surface-
tension of Solutions" (Phil. Mag. [51 xl.), and it is now
evident that they must be largely due to the difference
between the surface-layer and the body of water, and to a
Eossible action of the solute in dissociating some of the tri-
  ydrol. The solubility of substances in trihydrol may be
different from that in water. A re-examination of the surface-
tension of solutions would be full of interest.
   5. Latent Heat of Fusion, Specific Heat and Latent Heat
                         of Evaporation.
    According to what precedes, ice is pure trihydrol. The
crystallization of water in the hexagonal system is strong
confirmation of this ; throughout the enormous variety of
forms of ice-flowers the angle of 60° is the dominant factor,
and in the theory of halos the ice-crystals of the higher
atmosphere appear as necessarily hexagonal prisms. All this
points strongly to a decided three-directional symmetry in the
molecule of ice to which we shall return in section 8.
    Meanwhile we must regard the latent heat of fusion of ice
as no ordinary physical latent heat of fusion, for the melting
of ice is accompanied by the conversion of '625 of its trihydrol
into dihydrol ; the latent heat of fusion must be mainly a
chemical latent heat of dissociation. It is evident that this
must be so, because ice in melting contracts by one-ninth ;
and if there were no dissociation involved ought to show a latent
cold and not a latent heat of fusion. We can calculate what
the true physical heat of fusion of solid trihydrol into liquid
trihydrol ought to be approximately. In section 3 we took
the virial constant for dihydrol to be 1852 x 107 with the
dyne as unit of force ; and according to the laws of molecular
force the value for trihydrol must be nearly the same, as we
shall see it to be in a subsequent calculation in this section.
 If Of and p2 are the densities of solid and liquid trihydrol
at 0°, then its true heat of fusion in ergs should be l(p»'—pi),
nearly. But/>8' —p2 has been taken as '0366, and therefore
the true heat of fusion in calories of trihydrol expanding on
fusion would be 1852 x 10 X "0366/12 =16 calories. The
greater paft then of the 80 calories that go to the fusion of a
gramme of ice must be used to dissociate "625 gramme of
trihydrol into dihydrol and dissolve the remaining "375 gramme
in -625 gramme of dihydrol.

476                Mr. W. Sutherland on the
    Before going further we must consider the specific heat of
water. In this property water again shows its very excep
tional character ; not only is the specific heat much larger
than would be expected by analogy, but it is remarkably
nearly constant over a large range of temperature. Evidently
we have to do, not with a true physical specific heat, but with
a very complicated thermal phenomenon involving dissociation.
To unravel this we must make estimates of the specific heats
of trihydrol and dihydrol. According to Kopp's rule the
molecular specific heat of H20 ought to be made up of 2"3 X 2
for the hydrogen, and 4 for the oxygen, that is 8*6; and there
fore the specific heat ought to be 8 6/18 = '48, which is near
to the "504 for ice, but not to the 1"0 for water. According
to Kopp's rule the specific heat of trihydrol ought also to be "48,
unless some provision has to be made for the binding of three
H30 molecules into one, although all analogy indicates that
it would be slight. Thus ice regarded as a polymeric form of
H20 uncomplicated by dissociation has a latent heat in accord
ance with Kopp's rule, and by contrast the large specific heat
of water appears to be due to consumption of heat in causing
dissociation. On examining the available data I find that
substances on melting show an increase of specific heat
varying from 20 to 50 per cent., with an average of about 25 ;
and therefore we should expect pure liquid trihydrol at 0&
to have a specific heat about *625. Now we know from
Eegnault's determinations that even up to 190° the specific
heat of water increases but little ; and we therefore conclude
that at 200°, when most of the trihydrol has been dissociated
and the dissociation heat is of small account, the specific heat
of the tolerably pure dihydrol is 1/0. As the usual rate of
variation of the specific heat of liquids is about "1 per cent,
per degree, we may infer that pure dihydrol at 0 would have
a specific heat about *83. This result seems to involve a large
violation of Kopp's rule, according to which polymeric forms
of H20 ought to have a specific heat near -48. But the great
 difference in the densities of trihydrol and dihydrol at 0 makes
 it probable that there is a decided difference in their specific
 heats at 0°. As the best estimates that we can make at present,
 let us write for the specific heats
                        Cl = -6(1 + -001<),                   (23)

    In the heating of a gramme of water we have to supply
 heat to raise the temperature of p1 parts of dihydrol and of ps
 parts of trihydrol, and also heat to dissociate some trihydrol

Pi gramme of dihydrol is mixed with pi=l—p, gramme of
liquid trihydrol, and D the heat absorbed in dissociating a
gramme of trihydrol into dihydrol, then for the heat dQ to

    As water consists mostly of dihydrol while steam is hydro],,
 it follows that the latent heat of evaporation of water is not

a true physical latent heat of evaporation, but includes the
heat of dissociation. We proceed to calculate the heat of
dissociation of dihydrol into hydrol and the true latent heat
of dihydrol.
   If we take 368 as the critical temperature of dihydrol, then
at $ of the absolute critical temperature, that is at 155° C,
the gramme-molecular surface-tension of dihydrol must be
about 2-121(368-155) or 452. Now according to the fifth
method of finding the virial constant I for a substance (" Laws
of Molecular Force," Phil. Mag. [5] xxxv. p. 258),
where c=1209 when I is measured in terms of the megadyne
and a of the dyne ; for dihydrol

where T» is the boiling-point (absolute), X the latent heat of
evaporation, and v the volume of a gramme of the liquid at
the boiling-point. Now \ does not vary rapidly with the
temperature, so we shall make but little error in taking 100°
as the boiling-point of dihydrol ; then
                T4=373,     M=36,      »=l-009;

   But the latent heat of water at 100° is 537, and is the heat
of evaporation of a solution of -217 gramme of trihydrol in
¦783 of dihydrol, and of the dissociation of both into
hydrol.
   Now the removal from solution of the *217 gramme of
trihydrol would require by (28) 52'8 calories, and its dis
sociation into dihydrol by (27) 38-4; so that to convert a
gramme of water at 100° into pure dihydrol requires alto
gether 91*2 ; and therefore for the evaporation of a gramme
of dihydrol and its dissociation into hydrol 537 — 91 calories
are required ; and therefore the heat of dissociation of a
gramme of dihydrol into hydrol is 446 — 257 or 189 calories.
   We can partly check this result by the following rea
soning. To dissociate a gramme of trihydrol into hydrol via

                   Molecular Constitution of Water.            479
  dihydrol will require 177 + 189 or 366 calories, and for the
  solid trihydrol 382 ; the usual so-called latent heat of evapo
   ration of ice is about 660 ; and thus the latent heat of eva
  poration of liquid trihydrol, if evaporated without dissociation,
  would be 278 calories; of solid trihydrol 294.
      The latent heat of evaporation of trihydrol at its boiling-
  point can be estimated in exactly the same way as that of
 dihydrol. As 0,(54/^)* at 0° is 1141, and diminishes 2*121
  per degree till it is zero at the critical temperature, the
 critical temperature of trihydrol is 538° 0.; therefore at §
  of the absolute critical temperature o,(54//j2)f is 271 X 2*121,
 and
                    I = 1209 x 271 x 2-121 x iy54,

               .'. I =15,440, with 106 dynes as unit.
     Taking the absolute boiling-point at f of the absolute
 critical temperature, as it nearly is for most liquids, we find
 for X by (29) at 267° C. the value 209. This is at 267°,
 while at 0° on our former reasoning the value found was 278,
 and these two are in reasonable agreement, implying about
 250 at 100° C.

    In its viscosity water shows one of its most characteristic
peculiarities, namely, the decrease of its viscosity with in
crease of pressure, discovered by Rontgen, and discussed by
him in his theory of the constitution of water. We can
make this phenomenon the subject of quantitative study,
thanks to the refined measurements made by R. Cohen ( Wied.
Ann. xlv.). But it will be best to take the variation with
temperature first. At 0° trihydrol is below its true physical
melting-point, and accordingly we should expect the viscosity
of the liquid trihydrol to be very great ; on the other hand,
dihydrol at 0 is probably far above its melting-point, and
must have a relatively small viscosity • therefore the viscosity
of water at temperatures near 0° must be mainly that of the
trihydrol in it, the dihydrol gradually becoming of more
importance as the temperature rises.

   lxxi.) find the following type more successful •

       As to variation of viscosity of a pure liquid with tem
    perature, it seems to me best to use the equation of Graetz

    some tens of degrees below the solidifying-point. Then for
    water we write

that is to say, that an increase of pressure of 100 atmos causes
the viscosity of trihydrol at 0° to increase by 3"4 per cent.
For ethyl oxide and benzene at 20°, Warburg and Sachs
{Wied. Ann. xx.) found a corresponding percentage increase
¦of 7"3 and 9"3, and Cohen for turpentine found 15, and these
are nil more compressible liquids than trihydrol. In regard
to viscosity, trihydrol behaves like a normal liquid, and the
•exceptional change of the viscosity of water under pressure
is due to the dissociation caused by the pressure, which
replaces some of the highly viscous trihydrol by the less
viscous dihydrol. Cohen's curves show that at about 30°
the viscosity of water must be almost independent of pressure
up to 1000 atmos ; at this temperature the normal effect and
the dissociation effect neutralise one another.
    The preceding treatment of water's viscosity shows that
the viscosity of aqueous solutions must be highly complicated
on account of the action of the solute in altering the pro
portions of trihydrol and dihydrol in the solution. It is
known that the viscosity of some aqueous solutions of solids
is less than that of water itself. The reason for this sur
prising old fact is now apparent ; the solute converts enough
•of the viscous trihydrol into the less viscous dihydrol to more
than compensate for the increase of viscosity which its own
presence imparts.

   Of the dielectric capacity of water and ice we have already
(made some study in section 2, for electric fields alternating
with the frequency of light, since n2 stands for K, the di
electric capacity. But for K in more slowly alternating
fields and in a steady field the experimental results are in
apparent conflict. Thus Heerwagon (Wied. Ann. xlix.) and
Drude {ibid, lix.) find a steady, almost linear diminution of C

  482                Mr. W. Sutherland on the
  water with temperature from 0° to 80°; while Thwing (Zeittch*
 f. Phys. Chem. xiv.), with rapidly alternating oscillations
  (period not given), finds the capacity rise to a sharp maximum
  at 4°. In his measurements for different mixtures of alcohol
  and water at a fixed temperature, instead of a steady curve
  representing the variation of K with composition, he gets a
  curve containing cusps .at points which correspond to the
  formulas CsH60 + t;H20, C2H60 + 3H20, and C,H60 + Hs0>
  and similarly for mixtures of water with propyl alcohol, methyl
  alcohol, glycerine, and acetic acid, he gets cusps at points of
  definite molecular proportions. Drude {Zeitsch. J. Phys.
  Cliem. xxiii.), on the contrary, gets a steady curve for K for
  water-alcohol mixtures running the same course as Timing's
  with the cusps smoothed out. It looks, therefore, as if
 Thwing had used a period of vihration which was particularly
 sensitive to arrangements of electrons in regular order corre
 sponding to the molecular proportions in his mixtures. His
 sharp cusp for water at 4° is indicated by the following
 excerpts from his data :—
        Temp              0°     2-2°     4°       0°     7°
        K               79-46   80-84    85-2    80-84   794
  Otherwise his observations for water make K run with
 temperature a course very similar to that found by Drude
 and Heerwagen. If his cusp for water has the same signifi
 cance as his cusps for other mixtures, we should have to take it
 as implying for water at 4° the composition (H20)j + J3(H20)2,
 that is, "333 trihydrol mixed with *6b'7 dihydrol, while, our
 formula (9) gives 'SCiii with "637. An alteration in our
 somewhat arbitrarily chosen density of liquid trihydrol ("88)
 at 0° would change these proportions to "333 and 'G67 ; but
 until Thwing's remarkable observations have been confirmed
 by further special experiments, I should not feel quite war
 ranted in making such changes in the constants of this paper
 as would make the composition of our standard mixture at 4°
 to be (H20)3 + 3(H20)o. That ice near 0° shows K of the
 order 78 when tested by electric oscillations of period about
 10 -1 to 10-2 second, and of the order 2 for periods of 10~*
and less, is a fact of prime importance in the relation of
molecules to electrons. Dewar and Fleming's measurements
of K at low temperatures bring out also the high promise of
K for giving an insight into molecular architecture. But for
the present the experimental data for water and ice hardly
allow of more elaborate investigation than the above.

organic and metallic, and other oxygen-containing compound!?,
to polymerize (see L. Henry, " The Polymerization of the

explained by assigning to oxygen a higher valency than
the dyad which it usually shows. Evidence for the tetrad
nature of oxygen has been submitted by Friedel, Heyes
(Phil. Mag. f 5J xxv.), and Briihl (Ber. d. Deut. Chem. Gesel.
xxviii., xxx.). The tetrad valency may in reality be hexad
sometimes ; but on the principle of assigning the minimum
valency that will explain the facts, we shall assume oxygen to
be tetrad. The graphic formula for trihydrol then becomes
that shown : —
                            H           H
                             l           I

                                 \ /
   The centres of the three oxygen atoms determine a plane
and a triangle in it, whose average shape must be equilateral.
It is improbable that the hydrogen atoms lie in the same
plane as the oxygen, but as their masses are small in com
parison with those of the oxygen, the centre of mass of each
HjO group is near to the centre of the oxygen atom in it, and
the equilateral triangle must be the dominant feature of the
molecule of trihydrol. The hexagonal form of the ice crystals
and the formula of trihydrol both demonstrate that the domain
of a molecule of ice is an equilateral triangular prism. As
this is, I believe, the first case in which a definite shape has
been ascertained for a molecule, it would be interesting in
connexion with it to investigate systematically the properties
of crystalline ice in different directions.
   For dihydrol, on the same principle, the graphic formula
will be this :—
                               H     H

   There is a strong probability that in water some of the

484                Mr. W. Sutherland on the
trihydrol is continually dissociating into dihydrol, and some
of the dihydrol associating to trihydrol ; hut the most striking
dissociation of trihydrol into dihydrol is that which accom
panies the melting of ice. Under a given pressure this
occurs with remarkable definiteness at a corresponding
temperature.
    The thermodynamical discovery and explanation of the
lowering of the melting-point of ice by pressure, though so
justly famous in the history of the science of heat, give no
 clue to the mechanical or molecular cause of this remarkable
phenomenon. In a solid body we assume the molecules so
to hinder one another's motion, that each is kept vibrating
within narrow limits round a certain point. With rise of
temperature the mean distance between two neighbours
 increases, and when the distance increases to such an extent
 that the molecules can no longer hem one another in, they
all start migrating, and the solid is said to melt. Now at the
 melting-point an increase of pressnre, by forcing the mole
cules nearer to one another, ought to necessitate an increase
 of temperature to cause melting, for the increase of tem
 perature would neutralize the effect of the increase of pressure.
 This is the molecular explanation for the usual fact that
 increase of pressure increases the melting temperature. But
 in the exceptional case of ice, although it expands with heat
 as long as it is ice, and shrinks under pressure, yet though
 pressure brings the molecules nearer together, they escape
 by melting at a lower instead of a higher temperature.
 Moreover ice at 0° is a solid of very considerable rigidity,
 though it is on the very verge of melting. Its actual
 rigidity has not been measured, but as it has a Young's
 modulus between 20,000 and 90,000 (probably 70,000) kgms.
 weight per sq. cm., that of glass at 15° being 500,000, and of
 silver 760,000, it is evident that ice on the verge of melting
 still enjoys a remarkable degree of rigidity. The melting of
 ice is of an entirely different character from that of an
 ordinary physical melting. We have proved it to be accom
 panied by considerable dissociation. A simple conception of
 the dynamical cause of this dissociation can be obtained by
 following the lines of investigation of "A Kinetic Theory of
 Soiids " and " Further Studies on Molecular Force " (Phil.
 Mag. [5] xxxii. & xxxix.). In these papers it is assumed
 that in solid compounds atomic motions are more important
 than molecular, because of Joule's and Kopp's law that each
 atom contributes a definite atomic heat. The atoms in the
 solid are still held by the chemical forces in their proper
 arrangement to form the molecule, but the molecules are so

                  Molecular Constitution of Water.            485
  close to one another that the atoms of adjacent molecules
 jostle one another almost as freely as do the atoms within a
  single molecule. In the case of ice, by far the greater part
  of its heat-energy consists of the kinetic energy of the
  hydrogen and oxygen atoms, almost as if ice were a mech
  anical mixture of these, except that each oxygen atom and
  its two combined atoms of hydrogen influence one another's
  relative motions by the action of the chemical force.*. In
  the same way in the molecule of trihydrol (H20)s, the
  chemical forces must be regarded chiefly as controlling the
  H20 molecules into groups of three, thereby regulating their
  arrangement, but not seriously affecting the motion of the
  constituent atoms in any other way. Let us us name the
  oxygen atoms of (H20)3 A, B, C. Then for each there is
  some point where the attractions of all other atoms for it are
  in equilibrium ; call these for the three oxygen atoms a, ft, 7,
  forming an equilateral triangle. Then on the average A will
  vibrate through a in a direction perpendicular to fty with an
  amplitude w. The largest deformation of the equilateral
  triangle commonly occurring will be when A is displaced w out
   wards and B and C w inwards, or what this configuration
  changes to in half a period of its vibration when B and C are
  displaced 10 outwards and A w inwards. Let the side of the
. triangle be denoted by D, then the deformation of the
  triangle would be conveniently measured by w/D. When
  the deformation reaches a certain value, the chemical equi
  librium of the three oxygen atoms becomes unstable, the
  bonds AB AC may be said to break under the breaking-strain,
  or the electrons which form the chemical bonds swing round
  so that B and C are united by double bonds, and A is free
  to assist in upsetting the equilibrium of a neighbour molecule
  of (H20)»i an(l so the process goes on.
     Now D and w must both be regarded as functions of / the
  pressure and T the absolute temperature. Now the fact that
  to melt ice at constant pressure we have to warm it up to the
  melting-point, shows that w/D increases with T, as indeed
  we should expect to be the case. Again, from thermo
  dynamics and experiment we know that if the pressure on
  ice is increased by 1 atmo, the melting-point falls by "0075
  degree, and therefore w/D at constant temperature diminishes
  with increasing pressure. Both properties of w/D would be
  accounted for by considering D relatively more affected by
  pressure and le.-s by temperature than w. The dissociation
  of some of the trihydrol in water into dihydrol by increase
  both of temperature and pressure is explainable by these
  same properties of w and D.

486                Mr. W. Sutherland on tlie
   But these principles alone would lead us to expect that the
melting of ice should be preceded by a stage of general
softening, as with sealing-wax, on account of the occurrence
of isolated cases of instability before all the molecules got to
the unstable point. The sharpness with which the melting
of ice occurs seems to me to indicate that we have to do with
a phenomenon of molecular resonance. If the collisional
forces were removed, and also the intermolecular, then under
the chemical forces our triangle ABG would have a natural
period of vibration round the equilateral shape of equilibrium.
If the period of vibration of each of the atoms A, B, and C,
on account of other attractions and collisions, becomes the
same as this natural period, then by resonance small de
formations of A B C will be worked up to large enough ones
to attain the stage of instability. When some of the ice
dissociates into dihydrol, this dissolves the remainder, altering
for it both mj/D and the period of collisions, thus enabling it
to exist.
   The mechanical explanation of the melting of ice as a
process of dissociation consists then of two parts : one ac
counting for the occurrence of a position of instability, the
other accounting for the sharpness with which all the mole
cules attain this position simultaneously. The complete
molecular or mechanical theory of the lowering of the
melting-point of ice by pressure must then take account of
the change not only of the deformation w/D with temperature
and pressure, but also of the resonance.
   If the surmise is correct that molecular resonance plays
an important part in the melting of ice, then the dissociation
of trihydrol presents an interesting similarity to that of
rarefied ozone, to which I have drawn attention (" The
Spontaneous Change of Ozone into Oxygen, and a Remarkable
Type of Dissociation," Phil. Mag. [5] xliii.). As rarefied
ozone is gradually compressed, it begins at a pressure of
  14 mm. of mercury to dissociate, because the average fre
quency of collisions between the molecules is the same as
some natural frequency of vibration of the constituent atoms
or a simple multiple of it. This frequency must be of about
the order 108 per second. We can estimate the order of the
frequency which is destructive to molecules of trihydrol in
 the following way :—From the known so-called molecular
volumes of hydrogen and oxygen (really their molecular
 domains) we can infer that the oxygen atom occupies
about ^ of the space belonging to H20. Now the linear
coefficient of expansion of ice being 000157/3, the linear
interspaces between the groups H20 of ice at 0° centigrade

               Molecular Constitution of Water.            487
(see " A Kinetic Theory of Solids ") will be of the order
¦000052 x 273 x 7 times the mean diameter of the H20 group,
but as the H atoms move four times as fast as the O atoms,
and there are 2 of them to 1 of O of about the same
size, we may give the oxj'gen atoms an amplitude £ of the
linear interspace allotted to each H20. The velocity of the
0 atom is of the order 4ti,000 cm. per sec, and the diameter
of the H20 group of the order 2 x 10-9 cm., so the required
frequency is of the order 46 X 9 X 1018 -4-(2x2x7x52x 273),
or 1015 per sec. As the frequency for the most luminous
part of the solar spectrum is of the order 5 x 10u, we find
that our calculated destructive frequency of vibration for the
molecules of trihydrol must be about the same as that of
some part of the measured solar spectrum, in which the
frequency ranges from less than 10w to about 1015 per sec.
If resonance plays an important part in the melting of ice,
then ice ought to absorb powerfully radiation of the right
period, and to show anomalous dispersion in neighbouring
parts of the spectrum. In the visible spectrum, ice shows no
anomalous dispersion. The absorption spectrum of ice in the
infra-red and ultra-violet regions would be worth study.
   The laws of the dissociation of dihydrol (H20)2into hydrol,
HaO, could be worked out by an examination of the be
haviour of the vapour of water at pressures and temperatures
up to and beyond the critical. It is probable that in ordinary
water there is a little dissociation of dihydrol into hydroL
The question arises as to whether (H20)2 can be split into
positive and negative ions H20, the difference between which
and the molecules of water-vapour would be the same as the
difference between the zinc ion and the atom of zinc-vapour.
The theory of electric conduction in aqueous solutions may
be considerably affected by the possible participation of
H20 ions.
   The difference between the H20 molecule and the H20
ion could be expressed by saying that each negative H20
ion contained two negative electrons, whereas the molecule
HsO contains a negative and a positive electron that equili
brate one another within the molecule. The formation of
(H20)2 consists then in two H20 molecules exchanging
electrons, so that one has two negative and the other two
positive, which equilibrate as long as the (H20)2 lasts. In
(HsO)a each H20 has a positive and a negative electron, but
these, instead of equilibrating one another within the group,
equilibrate with those of the other groups so as to hold the
(H20)3 together.

                           y. Summary of Results.
    Ordinary water-vapour being H20, which it is proposed to
-call internationally hydro], ice is trihydrol (H20)3, and water
a mixture of trihydrol and dihydrol (H20)2, the proportions
of which are determined by equations (7) and (U) U|> to 100°
.and approximately to 200°. Probably at its critical tempera
ture water is practically pure dihydrol. The latent heat of
fusion of ice is not an ordinary physical latent heat of fusion,
but is mostly a latent heat of dissociation of trihydrol into
dihydrol, partly masked by heat of solution of trihydrol in

XLVII. Experiments to Determine whether a Liquid when elec
    trified loses any portion of its charge by Evaporation. By
    W. (!raig Henderson, M.A., B.Sc, Trinity College
     Cambridge, late 1851 Exhibition Science Scholar*.
THE question whether the vapour rising from the surface
         of an electrified liquid is itself electrified or not, has
received considerable attention during recent years ; but un
fortunately the various physicists who have made experiments-
on the subject have not all arrived at the same conclusion.
     On the one hand a negative answer is given to the question
 by Blake t, by SchwalbeJ, and by Sohneke§; while on the
 other hand Exner|| and Pellat^f both answer the question in
 the affirmative. Each of these two physicists proceeds to
 apply this conclusion from his experiments to the case of
 evaporation of water from the earth's surface, and seeks thus
 to account partly for the electrification of the atmosphere.
 On consideration of Pellat's paper it seemed to me not in
 advisable to make still one more investigation of the problem,,
 and this idea was approved of by Professor J. J. Thomson.
     In the experiments described below I have kept in view
 Pellat's application to the case of atmospheric electricity, and
 have therefore in the first place followed him in using only

water, negatively charged, as the liquid to be evaporated,
aDd in making all the experiments at the ordinary tempera
ture of the room. Following these experiments I have made
further experiments with water heated up to the boiling-
point, thus ensuring rapid evaporation ; and, lastly, experi
ments were made in which ether was used as the liquid to be
evaporated.
    It may be stated here that the result of my experiments is
in opposition to that of Pellat's, as they show no loss of
charge from the liquid by evaporation.
        1. Evaporation of Water at Ordinary Temperature
                                    of Room.
    The method of experiment used by Pellat was to insulate
a shallow vessel on a block of paraffin, connect it to the in
sulated quadrants of an electrometer, charge it to a known
potential noting the deflexion on the electrometer scale, and
then observe the leakage of this charge during a certain
time. The experiment was then repeated with the vessel full
of water. In this way Pellat found that the leakage was
somewhat greater when the vessel was full of water than
when it was empty. The results of four sets of experiments
are given and are as follows :—
                           Time between Electrometer Deflexion
            Potential      beginning and   (a) with ] (6)without Excess of
             in Volts.    end of experimt.    Water in vessel.   (a) over (4).

   II. ...      110            1 39*         145-0       135-5        9-5

    It will be seen that in these experiments the excess of
leakage when water was present over that when there was
no water is in no case more than 8*5 per cent, of the leakage
observed without any water in the vessel. The presence of
so large* a leakage when the vessel is empty would seem to
introduce a possible ambiguity into the result when water is
   • The percentage of the loss of charge vrithout water in the vessel to
the total charge given to the system, as denoted by the deflexion on the
electrometer scale, is as follows :—

                Loss of Charge by Evaporation.               491
present in the vessel ; and therefore in the experiments now
to be described, a method was adopted which should not be
open to this objection.
   The method of experiment and the apparatus employed
can be most easily described by reference to the annexed
diagram. A cylindrical metal box, A, had a platform of
metal, B, inside it, insulated from the bottom of the box by
ebonite plugs. The lid of the box had a similar platform, a disk
of metal, C, underneath it, similarly insulated from the lid.
A wire passed from B through a hole in the side of the box
to [the insulated quadrants of an electrometer, and had that
                               Fig. I.
portion of its length which was outside the box surrounded
by a metal guard-tube D. The vessel, V, containing the
water was of lead, 8 cms. in diameter and 1*5 cms. in depth,
and was placed on the platform B. The distance between C
and the surface of the water was 2 cms. The disk C was
connected by a wire passing through a hole in the lid to one
terminal of a battery of storage-cells, while the other ter
minal of the battery was put to earth by connecting it to a
gas-pipe. The uninsulated quadrants and sheath of the
electrometer, the box A, and the guard-tube D, were con
nected by a wire with one another and with the gas-pipe.
   The experiments are performed as follows :—The water-
vessel resting on B is put to earth byjoining the two pairs of
quadrants. Thus the box A and the water-vessel are at the
same potential. Next C is connected to the positive terminal of
the storage-cells (a sufficient number being used to give the
desired potential), and the negative terminal put to earth.
Then the connexion between the two pairs of quadrants is
broken, so that the water now has a negative charge ; but it
is at the same potential as the box from which it is insulated
so that there should be no tendency to leak down the ebonite
supports. If the water in V, however, loses some of its
charge by evaporation, this equality of potential will no

 492                   Mr. W. Craig Henderson on
 longer exist, and a positive deflexion on the electrometer
 scale will be obtained.
    Consider what would be the effect of the atmosphere in
the box becoming saturated with water-vapour. In such a
 state evaporation still continues, only there is as much con
 densation as evaporation. Thus it the evaporating particles
 earn- a charge they should be driven by the electric field
 over to the plate C and there discharged, while the particles
 condensing on the water-surface do not bring a charge with
 them. But probably around these charged particles a rapid
 condensation would take place, and some of them would be
 returned to the water- vessel carrying their charge with them.
 In order, therefore, to obtain the maximum effect the holes
in the side and lid of the box were large enough to prevent
 saturation of the atmosphere within.
    To eliminate external effects experiments were made with
the vessel V empty as well as with V full of water. The
following are the results of four experiments :—
                                                   Deflexion from zero of
                                   Potential of C.      Electrometer.
                                     + 80 volts        0 in 57 minutes

       (J) With                      + 143 „        + 9 „ 60      „
    In III. (a) the potential of the cells fell through 2 volts m
the hour during which readings wrere taken; while in III. (b)
it fell through 3 volts. It remained, therefore, to find the
effect on the deflexion of this fall of potential. To determine
this V was put to earth by joining the pairs of quadrants, C
was then raised to a known potential, and V then insulated.
The wire from C to the cells was then disconnected from the
cells and joined to the case A, and the deflexion on the elec
trometer noted. The following readings were taken :—
With +4 volts on C, when C was put to earth, deflexion = — 4 scale-divisions.
   „ +20        „    „                                  =-20
   „ +40                         ,                      =-40
The inductive effect, therefore, on V of a fall of potential of
C is to give a negative deflexion on the electrometer scale
of 1 scale-division per volt fall of potential. To the deflexion
in experiment HI. (a) we must therefore add 2, and to that
in III. (b) we must add 3. We thus get a deflexion of 12
in each case.

                 Loss of Charge by Evaporation.                493
     We have seen that a loss or diminution of the negative
  charge on the water in V gives a positive deflexion on the
 electrometer. But the positive deflexion obtained in the first
 of these two experiments, with V empty, has not been in
 creased in the repeated experiment with V full of water.
 And in tho experiments at a lower potential with water in V,
 although V was perfectly insulated from the enclosing box,
 the two remained at the same potential throughout the dura
 tion of the experiment. We may therefore conclude that
 there has been no loss of charge from the water by evapora
 tion of sufficient amount to be detected by this method of
 experiment.
     We have, therefore, next to determine the minimum loss
 of charge which could have been detected. To do this we
 require to know the capacity of the system consisting of
 quadrants, wire, and vessel V. By comparison with a con
 denser consisting of two coaxial cylinders of known dimen
 sions this was found to be 83 electrostatic units.
    Take \ division per minute as the minimum deflexion
 which could be relied upon. A Clark cell gave a deflexion
 of 31 divisions; that is 1 division is equivalent to a potential-
 difference of l-434/31 of a volt. Let q denote the corre
 sponding loss of charge from V per second per unit area.
 Then, since radius of V is 4 cms.,
                1     1     1-434        1               1
           q= 60 X 5" X "31" X 300 XMX ttW"
             = 0'84x 10~6 electrostatic units.
Thus a loss of charge from V of 0*86 X 10~6 of an electro
static unit per second per square centimetre could have been
detected.
        2. Evaporation of Water at High Temperature.
    Arrangements were now made to experiment with water
heated up nearly to the boiling-point. Readings were not
taken when the water was actually boiling as electrical effects
due to bubbling might then be introduced, and also because
it has already been found * that the steam rising from boiling
water charged with electricity carries off' none of that
charge.
    For these new experiments a slight change in the apparatus
of fig. 1 had to be made. There the insulating supports of
the plate C and of the platform B are inside the case A ; but

as the warm vapour might condense on these supports and
so spoil the insulation it was necessary to have all insulators
mttsiiie the case A containing the water-vessel. The arrange
ment made is shown in tig. 2.
   The metal disk B supporting the water-vessel V was fixed
                             Fig 2.
                                              BUNSEN BURNER
at the end of a stout bar of brass (of breadth 1 cm.) which
passed into the case A, of galvanized iron, by a narrow slot
in the side. Outside the case A this bar passed along the
axis of a metal tube D, fixed in clamps, and was supported
 by D, and insulated from it, by plugs of sulphur at the ends.
 These sulphur plugs had cork centres through which the bar
 passed, in order to prevent melting of the sulphur by heat
 conducted along the rod. The other end of this bar was
 connected as before by means of a mercury cup to the insu
 lated quadrauts of the electrometer. A piece of ebonite was
 fixed above the lid of the case A at the end of a short brass
 angle-piece rivetted to the lid, and through this ebonite
 passed a stout wire turning down through the hole in the
 lid, and bearing the disk C at its end inside the case. Al]
 other connexions were as before. The water-vessel now used
  was of tinned iron and of the same radius as the lead vessel
 used in fig. 1. A large Bunsen-burner was placed under the
 case A, and a metal screen was attached to the case to prevent
 as much as possible any of the hot gases from reaching the
 rod attached to the electrometer.
    In actual experiments it was found that as long as the
 Bunsen flame was present there was always an electrical
 effect, due to this flame, shown on the electrometer. As
 soon as the flame was extinguished this effect ceased. Head
 ings were therefore taken while the liquid was cooling. In

        order, however, to show the effect of the flame a double set
        of readings is given in experiment (1) in the table below ;
         the first set was taken while the flame was present and the
        water was being heated up, the second set was taken after
         the flame had been extinguished and the water left to cool.
         Between these two sets of readings the quadrants of the
        electrometer were of course connected together so as to start
        the second set from the zero-point of the scale. It will be
        seen that in both sets the deflexion obtained with water in
        the vessel is practically the same as that obtained with the
        vessel empty. In other experiments, however, this first set
        of readings was omitted, as so large a deflexion due to an
        outside cause might give rise to ambiguity.
           In some experiments, instead of heating up the water in
        the case, the water was boiled apart over a separate Bunsen
        flame, while the case with its lid in position was heated up
        by its own Bunsen flame till a temperature of over 100° C.
        was obtained inside the case. The boiling water was then
        introduced quickly, the lid replaced and connexion made
        with the battery, and then when the flame was extinguished
       a sot of readings could be commenced.
           The following table gives the results of three experiments.
       The double set of readings in experiment (1) has been already
       explained.

          In these experiments, omitting the readings while heating
      in experiment (1), it will be seen that in no case was the
     positive deflexion greater when water was present in V than
     when V was empty ; bat it should be greater if the vapour

carried off any of the negative charge. The conclusion,
therefore, again is that there has been no loss of charge by
evaporation snch as could be detected by this apparatus.
We shall consider later what that amount would be.
   A further series of experiments was made corresponding
to those just described, but using distilled water and with
the surface of the water carrying a positive instead of a
negative charge. These, however, gave results in no way
different from the above.
                      3. Evaporation of Etlier.
   To make still further tests on this subject, since those with
water had given a different result from that obtained by
Pellat, experiments were now made with ether as the evapo
rating liquid. A very rapid evaporation was thus obtained
at the ordinary temperature of the room.
    The apparatus used was that of fig. 2, and in the experi
ments made it was found that in the course of an hour,
without any heat being applied to the case, the liquid, which
at first filled the vessel V, had almost entirely evaporated
away. The results of three experiments are given in the
following table : —

    Jn (c), since the liquid has a positive charge, any loss "of
 charge due to evaporation should give a negative deflexion.
    Tims even with this rapid evaporation no loss of charge
 due to evaporation can be detected.
     It only remains to show what loss of charge could be
 detected by the apparatus used in these experiments. The
 capacity of the system shown in fig. 2 was found to be
 152 c.G.s. units, the increase on that of fig. 1 (viz. 83) being ;

probably due to the introduction of the flat rod along the
axis of the guard-tube, as the dimensions and distances of
the other parts of the apparatus were practically the same
as in fig. 1. In these experiments, however, with hot water
and with, ether, the sensitiveness of the electrometer had been
increased to 45 divisions per Clark cell. From these values,
taking as before one-fifth of a division per minute as the
minimum deflexion which could be relied upon, we get for
the minimum loss of charge per second per unit area which
could have been detected,

    While occupied with the experiments described above my
attention has been directed to a second paper by Schwalbe,
published this year (Wied. Ann. 1900, Band i. No. 2, p. 294).
Besides criticising Pellat's method he gives the results which
he has obtained on repeating hi.s own earlier experiments,
but using on this occasion-potentials similar to those used by
Pellat, and giving both positive and negative charges to the
liquid. He comes once more to the conclusion that they do
not support the theory of a loss of charge by evaporation.
    I desire to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to
Professor J. J. Thomson for the interest he has shown in this
work, and for his kindness in giving me every facility for
carrying it out.

XLVIII. On tlw Arc Spectra of some Metals, as influenced by
       an Atmosphere of Hydrogen. By Henry Crew*.
THE orderly arrangement of lines in the arc spectra of
        metals belonging to the first and second groups of
Mendelejeffs Table, and the apparent disorder among the
lines of the remaining groups, constitute one of the most
striking features of spectroscopic science in its present state.
That this disorder is only apparent is evident not alone on
It priori grounds but also from the fact that, among these very
elements, many pairs and groups of lines with constant
frequency-differences have already been discovered. One
great barrier to the discovery of more complete order in
these spectra is the enormous number of lines with which
.the metals of these groups are burdened.
    In order to simplify matters, the first step would, therefore,
appear to be the discovery of some basis upon which the
spectral lines of any one element might be separated into
                    * Communicated by the Author.

498                       Prof. H. Crew on the
 smaller divisions. Such an analysis would, at least, greatly
 increase the chances of finding new series.
    Such a basis of division has been already hinted at by
 Kayser *, who found that nearly two-thirds of all the reversed
 lines of palladium were arranged in triplets having the same
 frequency-differences. In short, reversibility appears to be
u distinguishing feature of a group of palladium lines whose
law of distribution is yet unknown.
    It occurred to the writer that possibly another basis for
 division might be found in the effects produced by surround
 ing the arc with various atmospheres of gas, as, for instance,
 hydrogen, nitrogen, coal-gas, ammonia.
    The experimentf with hydrogen was tried as follows:—
 An arc was operated between two metallic electrodes, one of
 which was in rapid rotation while the other was fed in slowly
 by means of a screw. This arc, including the rotating electrode,
 was placed in a brass hood which was made of two parts, not
 unlike the Magdeburg hemispheres, except that these two
hemispheres, instead of having flat faces, were threaded with
 a screw and provided with accurately turned flanges, so that,
 when closed, the hood was gas-tight.
    Into one of these hemispheres were fitted the two elec
trodes, one by means of a gas-tight bearing, the other by
 means of a gas-tight nut-and-screw. It was necessary, of
course, to insulate at least one of these electrodes from the
 brass hood ; this was done by placing the nut-and-screw
 on a slate plate which, in turn, was screwed on to the brass
hood.
    The shaft which carried the rotating electrode and the
 current could, therefore, touch the brass hood with impunity ;
 but, as a matter of fact, this was not the case.
    On the contrary, the shaft fitted loosely into a bearing
 which was packed with clean asbestos. This packing served
 not only the purpose of insulation, but also to prevent any
 oil reaching the interior of the hood. Consequently no
 hydrocarbons were formed at the arc unless from carbon
 impurities in the electrodes themselves.
    On the side opposite the arc, the hood was provided with
an opening into which screwed a brass tube about one foot
long. At its outer end, this tube carried an image-lens of
   * Kayser, " Bogen spectren der Elementen der Platin-gruppe," Abh.
lierl. Akad. 1897, p. 42.
   + The entire apparatus described below and the experiments depending1
upon it were made possible only through the generous consideration of
the Committee cf the American Academy of Science in charge of the
Kumford Fund.

quartz, which projected the arc npon the slit of a 10-foot
concave Rowland spectrograph.
   The hydrogen was furnished by three electrolytic cells,
made with sheet-lead electrodes in dilute sulphuric acid.
Each cell absorbed 12 amperes of current, so that the
hydrogen produced by 36 amperes was continually flowing
through the hood. This hydrogen, which was introduced
through a stopcock on one side, was allowed to escape through
a stopcock on the opposite side of the hood, where it burned
continuously as a " pilot " flame about 2 centimetres high.
   In the current of hydrogen, a trap, instead of a drying-
tube, was used ; for it was found by experiment that there
was no difference in effect between hydrogen which had been
dried by phosphorus pentoxide and sulphuric acid, and
hydrogen which had not been dried at all.
   The most marked effect of hydrogen on the arc spectrum
is a general diminution of intensity. Consequently, in order
to photograph the spectrum of the arc in hydrogen so as to
give, on the negative, an averago intensity equal to that of
the arc in air, one must make the exposure in hydrogen from
5 to 100 times as long as in air.
   The most interesting effect of the hydrogen atmosphere,
however, is not the change in the average intensity of the
entire spectrum, but the change of relative intensity in the
lines of any one substance.
   This change was studied by photographing on each
negative three spectra, side by side. The first was that of
the arc in air, the second that of the arc in hydrogen, the third
again that of the arc in air. But the exposure was always
so timed that the spectrum in hydrogen had an intensity
which was intermediate between the two intensities in air.
The advantage of this is that, in comparing intensities, if a
line is apparently weakened one has a still weaker spectrum
with which to compare it, and, hence, can decide whether
the weakening is due to under-exposure or due to some effect
on this particular line and not on the whole spectrum. In
like manner, if a line is apparently intensified, one has a still
stronger spectrum with which to compare it, and to convince
himself that the intensification is not due to over-exposure.
   The effects of hydrogen on the spectra of magnesium and
zinc are partially summarized in Tables I. and II., which
follow.

  The line at 2765*47 and the five triplets of still shorter
wave-length which complete Kayser and Bunge's list of
magnesium lines, are so entirely blotted out by the hydrogen
atmosphere that no comparison is possible even on plates of
four hours' exposure. And this is true even while manv
sharp lines, impurities, of still shorter wave-length appear on
the negative.

   The lines 2601'03, 2575-15, 2562-70, 2138-3, and the re
maining six triplets of Kayser and Runge could not be obtained
in the hydrogen arc under any reasonable exposure.
                        The Iron Spectrum.
   In the case of the iron arc, the number of lines is so enor
mous that we can here merely illustrate the effects of a
hydrogen atmosphere by giving the principal changes which
occur in the region covered by a single negative. In the first
column of the following table is given the wave-length of the
line. These wave-lengths are reliable only to about 0-05 of an
Angstrom unit. The second column gives the intensity of
the line in an atmosphere of hydrogen, on a scale which runs
from " 1" for lines just easily visible to "10" for the very
heavy lines. In the third column is given the effect pro
duced by Ivydrogen. Here the word " new " is used to
indicate that the line does not appear in the ordinary iron arc.
"Enh." is a contraction for the word "enhanced"; and the
 number which follows " enh." is intended to indicate, roughly
 of course, how many times greater the intensity of the line is
 in hydrogen than in air. The term " Dim." is a contraction
 of " diminished : " and the number following it indicates how
 many times weaker the line is in hydrogen than in air.
    The illustrations given are sufficient to show that the
 hydrogen atmosphere does more than slightly alter these
 spectra : it profoundly modifies them.
    The explanation of these changes may be simple ; but it is
 not patent. A number of hypotheses thrust themselves upon
one's attention ; but as a rule they are very difficult to test by
 experiment, and they have therefore little value. For
 instance, it does not appear impossible that the resistance of
the arc may vary considerably with the nature of the atmo
sphere surrounding it : and, if so, then the temperature and
the spectrum may vary. But whether, in such case, hydrogen
would serve to increase or to diminish the temperature, it is
 not easy to predict.
    In nearly all the spectra which I have photographed an
 average direct current of about 2 amperes has been employed,
 while the pressure between the electrodes has varied from 75
 to 100 volts. The current was constantly varying in intensity,
 and was often completely interrupted. Is it not possible that
 an atmosphere of hydrogen increases the rapidity of these
 interruptions, and hence alters the effects of self-induction,
 thereby changing the temperature of the arc?
    Still a third hypothesis is that the introduction of hydrogen

prevents the formation of oxygen and nitrogen compounds,
thus blotting out some lines: and that it permits the formation
of hydrogen compounds, thus accounting for the appearance of
new lines.
    Whatever the explanation may be, the following curious
relation was found to exist between the arc and spark
spectra, namely, all lines in the arc spectra which are affected
by hydrogen, whether enhanced or diminished, belong to the
spark spectrum also.
   To illustrate : the arc spectrum of tin in hydrogen shows
two strong lines at X 3352*15 and X 3283*31, of w-nich there
is not the faintest trace in the ordinary tin arc. But these
two are among the strong lines of the tin spark. See Hartley
and Adeney's list. In like manner, I have photographed, on
the same plate, the iron spark in air, the iron arc in air, and
the iron arc in hydrogen. In every case examined, the
lines affected by hydrogen are spark-lines.
    On the contrary, the lines which belong to Kayser and
Runge's series are unaffected by the change from air to hydrogen.
    If these series prove equally stable in other gases, this
stability may form a criterion for dividing a spectrum into
two groups— one of which will contain all the series lines, the
other of which will contain none of them.

XLIX. On a Diagram of Freezing-point Depressions for
    Electrolytes. By Prof. J. G. MacGrkgor, F.R.S., Dalhousie
    College, Halifax, JT.S.*
                                [Plate IV.]
THE object of this paper is to describe a diagrammatic
        method of taking a bird's-eye view of such knowledge
as we possess of the relation of the depression of the freezing-
f)oint to the state of ionization in aqueous solutions of electro-
 ytes, and to show that such diagrammatic study gives promise
of throwing much light upon the following questions :— (1) f
Has the depression-constant a common value for all electro
lytes, and if so what is it ? And (2) what is the state of
association, and what the mode of ionization, of electrolytes
in solution?

the Nova Scotitm Institute of Science.

Society of Canada, and to be published in its Transactions fer 1900.

506         Prof. J. G. MacGregor on a Diagram of
          Construction and Properties of the Diagram.
   If an extremely dilute solution contain an electrolyte whose
molecule as it exists in solution contains p equivalents and
dissociates into q free ions, and if a. is its ionization-coefficient,
and k its depression-constant, the equivalent depression will
be :
                       8=|(l+«{?-l)).
If, therefore, we plot a diagram of curves with ionization-
coefficients as ordinates, say, and equivalent depressions as
abscissae, the resulting curves must at extreme dilution (a= 1)
be tangential to the straight lines represented by the above
equation, provided the proper values of &, j»,and q be employed.
These straight lines, which for shortness we may call the
tangent lines of the curves, can readily be drawn in the
diagram with any assumed value of k, and on any admissible
assumptions as to the values of p and q. In the diagram
(PI. IV.) the broken lines are the tangent lines for the electro
lytes examined, on various assumptions as to constitution in
solution and mode of ionization, and for A=l-85. They are
indicated by the inscriptions 1-2, 2-3, &c, the first figure in
each giving the number of equivalents in the molecule as it is
assumed to exist in solution, and the second the number of
free ions into which the molecule is assumed to dissociate.
Thus 1-2 is the tangent line for an electrolyte such as NaCl,
on the assumption that it exists in solution in single molecules,
each of which has therefore 1 equivalent and dissociates into
2 ions. If assumed to associate in double molecules with
unchanged mode of ionization, its tangent line would be
indicated by 2-4 ; and if the double molecules were assumed to
dissociate into Na and NaCls, by 2—2. The line for H2S04 on
the assumption that its molecules undergo no association and
have thus 2 equivalents, and that they dissociate each into 3
ions, would be indicated by 2-3.
   In a few cases dotted lines have been introduced to show
what the tangent lines would be with other values of k, 1*83,
&c, the constant used in such cases being indicated.
   The curve for any given electrolyte must start at the inter
section of its tangent line with the line «=1, to which point
we may refer for shortness as the intersection of its tangent
line. What its form will be may be anticipated from the
following theoretical considerations : —The equivalent depres
sion in dilute solutions of non-electrolytes is proportional to
the product of the osmotic pressure, P, and the dilution, V,
which corresponds to the product of the pressure p and specific

           Freezing-point Depressions for Electrolytes.        507
volume, v, in the case of a gas. If pv is plotted against v, the
resulting carve is convex towards the axis of v, and passes in
general through a point of minimum value of pv. Hence if
PV, and therefore equivalent depression, be plotted against
V, we may expect to get curves of the same general form.
And experiment shows that in some cases at least we do. As
in the case of gases the variation of pv is ascribed to the mutual
action of the molecules and their finite volume, so in the case
of solutions the variation of PV is attributed to similar dis
turbing influences.
   Owing to ionization the curve of an electrolyte will differ
from that of a non-electrolyte (1) because of the change thereby
produced in the number of the molecules (including free ions)
in unit of volume, and (2) because of the change produced in
the disturbing influences referred to. The former change is
doubtless the more important, and I shall assume the latter to
be negligible, for the present purpose. Now dissociation
increases continuously with dilution. If therefore association
of molecules does not occur, and if the mode of ionization
does not change, the equivalent depression must be increased
by the dissociation in a ratio which increases continuously with
dilution. The change produced in the curve by dissociation,
therefore, will be a shear parallel to the equivalent depression-
axis and increasing with dilution. The resulting curve will
consequently remain convex towards the axis of dilution, but
it will be less likely than the curve of a non-electrolyte to
exhibit the minimum point.
   If now we plot equivalent depression against ionization-
coefflcient, instead of dilution, the result will be the same as
if we shortened the dilution ordinates of the various points of
the curve just mentioned, in ratios increasing with the dilu
tion ; which process must leave the curve convex towards
what was the dilution-axis, but is now the ionization-coefficient
axis.
   If therefore no change occur in the association of molecules
or in the mode of ionization, the curve of an electrolyte on
the diagram must start at the intersection of its tangent line,
tangentially to that line, and bend away from it, as dilution
diminishes, to the right, possibly passing through a point of
minimum equivalent depression. We may speak of such a
curve as the normal curve for the tangent fine corresponding
to the given conditions as to constitution in solution and mode
of ionization.
   If, the constitution of the electrolyte in the solution remain
ing constant, the mode of ionization changes as dilution
diminishes, say in such a way that the molecules dissociate

 508          Prof. J. (x. MacGregor on a Diagram of
 on the average into a smaller number of ions, the equivalent
 depression will diminish more rapidly than it otherwise would.
 The curvature of the curve will therefore diminish and may
 possibly become zero and change sign, the curve thus becoming
 concave towards the ionization-coefficient axis and possibly
 crossing the tangent line. In such a case the curve will at
 the start coincide with the normal curve of the tangent line
 determined by the initial conditions as to association and mode
 of ionization, and at the finish with the normal curve of the
 tangent line determined by the final conditions ; and between
the start and the finish it will gradually change from the one to
the other.
   If, as dilution diminishes, association of molecules into double
or other multiple molecules occurs, the mode of ionization
remaining the same, the equivalent depression will be thereby
made to diminish more rapidly than it otherwise would, and
the general effect on the form of the curve will be of the same
kind as under the conditions just considered. But the normal
curves of the tangent lines determined by the final conditions
will be quite different in the two cases.
    It follows that by plotting, so far as experiment allows, the-
curves of observed equivalent depression against ionization-
coefficient, and drawing in the tangent lines for different
values of the depression-constant and on different assumptions
as to association and mode of ionization, we may be able to
determine, with a smaller or greater probability, what th&
state of association and the mode of ionization are, what are
the tangent lines to whose intersections the curves would run
out if observations at extreme dilution could be made, and what
the values of the depression-constant are to which these lines-
correspond.
                       Data for the Diagram.
    To draw the experimental curves, we must have corre
sponding values of the depression and of the ionization-
coefficient at the freezing-point, or what in most cases will
be sufficiently near, at 0° C. The former are obtained by
direct measurement ; but the latter only indirectly from con
ductivity observations. It is not of course known how closely
the ionization-coefficients, even during the passage of the
current, can thus be determined, or if the state of ionization
during the passage of the current is to be regarded as being
the same as when the current is not flowing. But as it has
been shown that electrically determined coefficients enable
ns to predict, within the limit of error of observation, not only

  the conductivity and results of electrolysis* of moderately
  dilute complex solutions, but also their density, viscosity, and
  other non -electrical properties f, it would appear to be
 probable that for moderately dilute and very dilute solutions
  electrically determined coefficients are approximately exact,
 not only for a solution through which a current is passing,
 but generally.
     The available data as to ionization-coefficients at 0° are
 unfortunately few. Whetham % has recently published some
 most valuable determinations, having measured the conduc
 tivity at 0° of series of solutions down to extreme dilution,
 with what one may call appareil <le luxe, and found the ratio
 of the equivalent conductivity to the maximum equivalent
 conductivity. For neutral salts his coefficients must inspire
 great confidence. But in the case ot the acids they seem to
 me to be probably too high. For the maximum equivalent
 conductivity of an acid is probably lower than it would be,
 were it not for the disturbing influence, whatever it is, which
makes the equivalent-conductivity-concentration curve not
only reach but pass through a maximum point, as concen
 tration diminishes.
    Archibald and Barnes §, working in my laboratory,
 measured the conductivity both at 0 and 18° for series of
solutions down to dilutions at which the ratio of the two con
ductivities became constant ; and assuming that the same ratio
would hold at extreme dilution, they calculated the equivalent
conductivity at extreme dilution for 0°from Kohlrausch's values
 for 18°. They usod this method only because appliances were
not available with which observations at extreme dilution
could be made. If the ratio mentioned really does become
constant as dilution increases, the method is likely to give
coefficients with too low or too high values according as the
 ratio at moderate dilutions diminishes or increases with
dilution (it was found to increase with KCl and K2S04). For
it will probably become constant within the limit of error of
observation before it has really reached constancy. And if
it changes with dilution in a slightly wavy manner, even
though on the whole tending to constancy, it may be regarded
as having become constant when really passing through a
maximum or minimum point.

  510           Prof. J. G. MacGregor on a Diagram of
      Ddguisne's* observations on the variation of conductivity
  with temperature between 2° C. and 34° have enabled me, by
  the method just mentioned, to make rough determinations of
  the ionization-coefficients at 0° in some cases, on the assump
  tion that his empirical constants might be used down to 0°.
  According to Deguisne's observations the ratio of the conduc
  tivities at 0° and 18° usually changes gradually down to
  dilutions of 1000 litres per gramme-equivalent, and between
  that and 2000 undergoes rapid change. As observations at
  great dilution are attended by considerable difficulty, I have
  assumed that these sudden changes were probably due to
  errors of observation. If they were not, my Deguisne
  coefficients (for which De"guisne himself is of course not to be
  held responsible) may be considerably out.
      In some cases I have obtained coefficients from the above
  data by extrapolation, in order to make use of available
   depression data. In such cases I have plotted side by side
   ionization-coefficient-concentration curves for both 0° and 18°,
   using values for 18° based on Kohlrausch's conductivities,
   and I have then produced the 0° curve beyond the limit of
   observation under the guidance of the 18° curve.
       I need not give here the values of the coefficients used in
   the diagram. They will be found in the paper f of which
   this is an abstract, and have been fairly accurately embodied
   in the accompanying diagram (Plate IV.).

              Freezing-point Depressions for Electrolytes.      511
   improvements in freezing-point determinations had been
   recognized as necessary.
      In cases in which there was but one series of observations
   available, I have plotted the actual observations in the dia
   gram, though sometimes smoothing the curves a little. In
   cases in which two or more series were available, I first
   plotted the various observations and then drew mean curves,
   making them represent all the observations as well as I could,
   but giving greater weight to recent observations than to
  those of earlier date, and to long series of consistent obser
  vations than to short series or to series which were more
  erratic. These mean curves were then entered in the
  diagram.
     The curves are labelled with the initial letters of observers'
  names (R for Raoult, &c, A for Archibald, Ab for Abegg),
  so as to show both the depression-observations on which they
 are based, and the ionization-coefficients used in plotting
  them. Thus the inscription KG1 (J-W) means that Jones's
 depressions and Whetham's coefficients were used ; H3S04
  (JLB-B), that the curve is a mean curve based mainly at
 least on depression-observations by Jones, Loomis, and Barnes,
 and plotted with Barnes's coefficients. The limits of concen
  tration for the curves are indicated also in gramme-equi
 valents per litre. The equivalent depressions plotted are in
 all cases depressions per gramme-equivalent in one litre of
 solution.
     Some of the curves are entered on an inset drawn on four
 times the scale of the main diagram.
     In interpreting the curves we must not only bear in mind
 what has been said above about the probable accuracy of the
 ionization-coefficients, but must in addition note the tendency
 exhibited by the curves of the various observers, as dilution
 increases, to run off at great dilution in directions, character
 istic of the observers, to the left or right relatively to the
 course pursued by them at moderate dilution. Thus Abegg's
 curves (see NaCl, KC1, K2S04) and Jones's (see NaCl, KOI,
 NH4C1, and HC1) run off to the right. So do Arrhenius's
 (not plotted), in a marked manner. Raoult's tendency is
also to the right (see NaCl ; his K2S04, not plotted, shows it
also ; his most dilute KC1 observation he himself clearly
regards as accidentally out). On the other hand, Loomis's
curves (see HC1, KN03, NH4C1, BaCl3) go to the left. So
do Ponsot's and probably Wildermann's (not plotted). And
I gather from Ponsot's diagrams of Pickering s observations,
to which I have not access, that Pickering's also have the
leftward tendency. Archibald's and Barnes's curves show
                              2 N2

512           Prof. J. (Jr. MacGregor on a Diayram of
less tendency to diverge than those of any other observers.
And although this may be partially, it is not wholly, due
to their having worked at moderate dilution only ; for in
several cases, pointed out below, the curves of other observers,
start on a divergent course within their limit of dilution.
But the fact that their curves usually agree with Loomis's
would lead one to suspect them of a leftward tendency also.
     The divergence, as shown on the diagram, is most marked
in the case of highly dissociated electrolytes (NaCl, HOI, &c),
in which at great dilution the rate of increase of ionization
with dilution is small, the curves being crushed up, therefore,
into a small space. But it is obvious also in the K2S04
curves (especially Al>egg's) and the BaCL, curves (including
Ponsot's, not shown). And although for MgS04 and HaP04,
whose ionization increases rapidly with dilution, the single
curves do not reveal it, the relative positions of the two
curves in each case are what they might be expected to be, if
they were tending unduly, Jones's to the right and Loomis s
to the left.
     This tendency is explicable at once when we reflect that as
 it is equivalent depression that is plotted, the errors of the
observations are brought into greater and greater prominence
 as dilution increases. According, therefore, as the character
 istic error of an observer's method of measuring total de
 pression is positive or negative, will his curves of equivalent
 depression diverge at great dilution to the right or left of
 their true course ; and they must diverge even if the error
 is very small.
     The equivalent-depression curves of individual observers
  are therefore open to grave suspicion at high dilutions; and
  since one can never be sure that the errors of different
  methods will even approximately neutralise one another,
  mean high-dilution curves are not much more trustworthy
  than their components *. It is much safer, therefore, to base
     * It is consequently inadmissible to proceed as Raoult has done, in
  determining depression-constants (loc. cit. p. 658J, viz., by selecting high-
  dilution curves which are in agreement and applying extrapolation to a
  mean curve derived from them ; for such procedure may involve the
  selection of observations made by methods which have characteristic
   errors of the 3ame sign. In fact a mean curve based on observations
   which agree well at low dilution, but disagree markedly at high dilution,
   would be likely to give a better result, as more probably combining
   observations with small characteristic errors of opposite sign. Raoult s
   procedure is open toother objections. For (1) his curves of equivalent
   depression against total depression make series of observations appear to
   be in greater disagreement than they really are, and are thus not helpful
   in making a judicious selection of observations to be used; and (2)-
   extrapolation of such curves not only gives a result affected by the

            Freezing-point Depressions for ^Electrolytes.         513
 conclusions as to depression-constants on moderate-dilation
 curves, although the conclusions they admit of may not be so
exact as we might wish.
                       Discussion of tJie Curves.
    Electrolytes such as KC1, HN08, KOH, have 1 equivalent
 in the single molecule and 2 ions. If, therefore, they exist
 in solution in single molecules, their curves will be normal
 1-2 curves. If their molecules are all double or triple, the
 curves should be 2-4 or 3-6 curves, provided association does
not involve change in the mode of ionization. If it does,
they may be 2-3 or 3-4, 3-3 or 3-2 curves respectively,
according to the change that may occur. If the molecules
are single at extreme dilution, but become double or triple as
dilution diminishes, the curves should start as 1-2 curves
and undergo the appropriate transformation.
    The electrolyte for which we have the most complete and
trustworthy data is KC1. The LB-B curve (see main dia
gram) is based for the most part on two series of observations
in close agreement and by methods exhibiting less divergence
than the others. Jones's curve runs a little to the right of
it ; Abegg's a little to the left. Both Raoult's and Wilder-
man n's cross it, the latter being somewhat steeper, the former
less steep. Ponsot's coincides with the lower part of it, but
in the upper part diverges to the left. In form the curve is
thus probably trustworthy ; but, being plotted with Barnes's
coefficients, it may be too high or too low. The R-W and
<T-W curves (see inset), are not open to this suspicion, but at
the dilutions to which even their lower and more trustworthy
parts apply they may have begun to diverge unduly right
wards. If the LB curve is plotted with Whetham's co
efficients (extrapolated) it comes into a position (see LB-W
curve on inset) to the left of the R-W and J-W curves, the
usual relative position of the curves of these observers.
 Looinis's own curve for somewhat greater dilutions than
those of the LB-W curve, when plotted with Whetham's
coefficients, coincides very nearly with the boundary-line of
the inset. Wildermann's is a little to the left of Loomis's,
and somewhat steeper. Both exhibit a slight rightward
bending, as do all the others.
average of the characteristic errors of the observations used, but also
neglects the possibility, in some cases the probability, that owing to
cliange in association and mode of ionization the law of the change of
curvature may be very different beyond the limits of observation from
what it is within these limits.

 514        Prof. J. G. MacGregor on a Diagram of
    It would be difficult to draw a mean curve with confidence;
 but any such curve would run about midway between the 1-2
 and 2-4 (1"85) lines, would have a slight rightward bending
 at its upper end, and if produced with diminishing curvature
 would run out to a point a little to the right of the 1-2 (1'85)
 intersection.
    If this intersection were the starting-point of the curve
 and if there were no association, the curve should lie wholly
 to the right of the 1-2 (1*85) line. If, as dilution diminished,
 sufficient doubling of molecules with unchanged mode of
 ionization should occur, the curve, after first bending away
 from that line to the right, would change its curvature, bend
 towards the line and cross it, and then run towards and
 finally away from the 2-4 line, as the mean curve appears
 to do.
    As the 2-2 line is far to the left, the mean curve might be
 accounted for also on the assumption of a very slight forma
 tion of double molecules dissociating into two ions —a
 formation of such molecules so slight as probably to involve
 no greater variation of the migration numbers with concen
 tration than has been observed.
    If the 1-2 (1*86) intersection be assumed as the starting-
 point of the curve, the mean curve would cut the 2-4 (1"86)
 line. If, therefore, association in molecules with unchanged
 mode of ionization were assumed, some formation of triple
 molecules would be indicated, and if the associated molecules
 were assumed to dissociate into two free ions, a greater
 extent of such association would be indicated. Thus with
 this starting-point less probable assumptions as to association
 must be made to account for the observations.
    If the 1-2 (1-84), or even the 1-2 (1"845) intersection
 were taken as the starting-point, the curve must bend con
 siderably to the left before running out, of which bending
 none of the experimental curves give any indication what
ever.
   The most probable conclusion then that we can draw from
the observations is that the depression-constant is 1*85, with
a limit of error of -01 or perhaps -005, that the electrolyte
has single molecules at great dilution, and that as dilution
diminishes either double molecules with unchanged mode of
ionization form to a considerable extent, or double molecules
dissociating into two ions, to a small extent.
   Loomis's and Barnes's observations on which the NaCl
(LB-B) curve is mainly based are also in close agreement;
but as Loomis's curve for slightly greater dilution bends
slightly to the right, the upper part of the LB-B curve

           Freezing-point Depressions for Electrolytes.      515
should probably have greater curvature. Jones's curve for
moderately dilute solutions runs a little to the left of it, and
at higber dilations diverges markedly to the right (as sepa
rately shown). Abegg's observations are on both sides of it,
but at higher dilations his curve also goes to the right, as
shown. Raoult's touches it, but goes off to the right. Ar-
rhenius's (not shown) is considerably to the right throughout,
and goes widely rightward at greater dilutions. Ponsot's is
a little to the left. As the LB-B curve is plotted with
Barnes's coefficients, it is probably too low. If it be raised
about 2*5 per cent., the amount by which Whetham's KC1
coefficients are higber than Barnes's, it will lie along the
1-2 (1"85) line, or a little above or below that line, with its
npper end so directed as to run out probably at a point nearer
the 1-2 (l-85) intersection than either the 1-2 (1"83) or the
1-2 (1'87) intersection. The defective data as to ionization
prevent our drawing a more definite conclusion than that the
association indicated, if any, is less than in the case of KOI,
and that the depression-constant is 1'85 with a limit of error
of perhaps O02.
   The HC1 curve is interesting as exhibiting a point of
minimum equivalent depression. The observations on which
the LB—B curve is based are in good agreement. Jones's
curve almost coincides with it in the lower part, but goes off
to the right in the upper part and at higher dilutions, as
shown separately. Loomis's curve at higher dilutions, also
separately shown, goes off to the left, but in a less marked
manner. As drawn, the upper part of the mean curve lies
between the 1-2 and 2-4 (1'85) lines, and it is running out
to a point a little beyond the 1-2 (1*86) intersection (see
inset). But as it is plotted with Barnes's coefficients it is
perhaps too low. If raised from 0 to 2 per cent, it might
run out at any point between the 1-2 (1*84) and 1-2 (1*86)
intersections. The data are of course very defective, but
they are consistent with a depression-constant of about l-85,
and they seem to indicate a greater extent of association than
in the case of KC1.
   The L-D and J-D curves for NH4C1 (see inset) are not in
agreement, having the usual relative position of L and J
curves. A mean curve based on their lower parts would be
slightly to the left of the 1-2 (1'85) line, and directed to
a point considerably to the right of the 1-2 (L"86) inter
section. It might thus indicate anything between a high
value of the depression-constant, accompanied by very con
siderable association of molecules, and a constant of about
1*85 without association in dilute solutions, and with only a
slowly increasing association in stronger solutions.

516      . Prof. J. G. MacGregor on a Diagram of
   The HNOjj curve (see inset) is a mean curve based on
Loomis's and Jones's. Both are beyond the bounds of the
inset, the former to the left and the latter to the right.
Neither this curve nor that of KNOa is sufficiently trust
worthy to warrant any close inspection ; but both are clearly
consistent with the 1'85 value of the depression-constant.
If the leftward bending of the KNO:l curve in its lower part
were actual, as well as the position of the curve, the formation
of triple molecules might be indicated. But being a Loomis
curve, it is open to the suspicion of being as a whole too far
to the left, and it is plotted with doubtful coefficients.
   The KOH curves, Loomis's on the main diagram and
Jones's on the inset, are useful only to illustrate the difficulty
of making concordant observations by different methods.
As usual, Loomis's is to the left and Jones's to the right.
   Electrolytes such as BaCl2, HsR04, NasC03 have 2 equi
valents in the single molecule which may dissociate into 3 or
into 2 ions. If there is no association, they will therefore
have 2-3 or 2-2 curves according to the mode of ionization.
If there is complete doubling of molecules, the curves will be
4-G or 4-4 curves, provided thedoubling does not involve change
in mode of ionization. Otherwise they might be 4-5, 4-3, or
4-2 curves. If the molecules are associated in threes, the
curves will be 6-tt or 6-G curves, with the above proviso.
   Both Loomis's and Jones's curves for BaCl2 are shown on
the diagram, plotted with Whetham's coefficients (rough
extrapolated values, however, in the case of the former).
Ponsot's curve agrees very closely with Loomis's. Bearing
in mind the rightward and leftward tendencies of Jones's ana
Loomis's curves respectively, we may conclude from the
curves of the diagram that the actual curve runs down to the
right of the 2-2 line, bending away from it to the right, and
that it would intersect the a=l line at a point between the
2-3 (1*85) and the 2-3 (1'87) intersections, probably nearer
the former than the latter. The curve is tbus, so far as we
can judge, a normal 2-3 (1*85 +01) curve, running however
very close to the 2-3 line. The diagram therefore indicates
that BaCl2 exists in solution in single molecules, dissociating
into three ions, at least for the most part, and that it has a
depression-constant nearer 1*85 than T87.
   The H2S(Xi (J-W) curve for high dilutions being a Jones
curve, is probably too far to the right, and, being plotted
with Whetham's coefficients, is probably too high. Wilder-
mann's curve for high dilutions runs parallel to it, con
siderably to the left. The JLB-B curve for lower dilutions
is very nearly coincident with Barnes's curve, and in its lower

            Freezing-point Depressions for Electrolytes.      517
 part with Jones's and Loomis's as well. But in the upper
 part Jones's curve goes off markedly to the right, and
 Loomis's markedly to the left. Wildermann's is slightly to
 the left at the lower end, and diverges somewhat leftwards in
 the upper part. Ponsot's runs nearly parallel to it somewhat
 to the left, and diverges to the left at higher dilutions. The
 JLB-B curve is thus trustworthy in form, but being plotted
 with Barnes's coefficients it is possibly too low. The actual
 curve would thus appear to cross the 2-3 (1'85) line not far
from its starting-point, bend towards the 4-6 (1'85) line, and
 run down below that line, finally bending slightly towards it
again. Its course is therefore what it would be if it started
as a 2-3 curve for A=l"85 or thereabout, changed its curva
ture at a somewhat early stage, and tended to be transformed
slowly into either a double-molecule curve or a 2-2 curve, or
perhaps both at once. The diagram would therefore indicate
that at extreme dilution H2S04 exists in solution in single
molecules dissociating into three ions ; that at an early stage
and in a somewhat marked manner, either doubling of
molecules sets in, or partial dissociation into two ions or
perhaps both ; that the change increases slowly and steadily as
dilution diminishes, and that at a concentration of about 0-6,
if the coefficients at this concentration are to be trusted, the
change is increasing in rate : also that the depression-constant
may quite readily be about 1*85.
    The KjS04 (LJA-A) curve is based on series of observa
tions which in the main are in good agreement. It very
nearly coincides with the Loomis and Archibald curves, and
Ponsot's (not shown) runs down slightly to the left. In its
lower part it coincides with the Jones curve, but in its upper
j >art Jones's curve (separately represented for great dilutions)
runs off to the right. Abegg's curve for higher dilutions
runs much more markedly to the right, though it is farther
to the left at its lower end. Arrhenius's (not shown) is con
siderably to the right and diverges widely rightwards. The
NajS04(LA-A) curve is also almost coincident with both
the Loomis and the Archil>ald curves. Both Raoult's and
Arrhenius's (neither shown) are considerably to the right and
diverge slowly rightwards. Such of these curves as are
entered on the diagram, being plotted with Archibald's
coefficients, are probably too high or too low, as the case may
be. Those for great dilutions are too discordant to admit of
discussion. The mean curves for both salts have the same
general form. They run down, as drawn, a little below the
2-3 (1'85) line. Their upper ends are so directed as to
suggest their running out at the 2-3 (1'85) intersection or

518      On Freezing-point Depressions for Electrolytes.
thereabout. At their lower ends they turn sharply to the left
and cross the 2-3 line, going towards the region of the double-
molecule curves or of the 2-2 curve. The turns are too sliarp
and the 4-6 and 6-9 lines too near to make their transforma
tion probable into double or triple molecule curves with un
changed mode of ionization. The diagram suggests rather their
transformation into 4—5, 4, or 2 or 2-2 curves. If this be
accepted, it means that at extreme dilution these sulphates
exist in solution in single molecules dissociating into three
ions, that partial dissociation into two ions or doubling of
molecules sets in apparently at an early stage, but increases
more slowly than in the case of H2S04 until the dilution has
been considerably diminished, when it undergoes rapid
increase. A close determination of the depression-constant
cannot be made ; but even if the curves have to be either
raised or lowered a little and if, Loomis's tendency being left
ward, their upper ends have to be shifted somewhat to the
right, they will be consistent with its being about 1*85.
   The NasC03 curves are too discordant to form a basis for
discussion. But either Loomis's curve or a mean curve, or
even Jones's curve itself is quite consistent with a depression
constant of about 1*85 ; and both curves indicate the occur
rence of rapid association or of rapid change of mode of
ionization after considerable diminution of dilution. The fact
that Loomis's curves tend towards the left, suggests that the
actual curve after starting at the 2-3 intersection may bend
considerably to the right before association or change of mode
of ionization has advanced sufficiently to change the direction
of its curvature.
   An electrolyte such as MgS01; according as it may exist in
solution in single, double, or triple molecules, and according
to their mode of ionization, may have a 2—2, 4—4 or 2, or
6-6, 4, 3 or 2 curve. Jones's curve lies to the right of the
2-2 (1*85) line, bending towards it, and may quite readily be
a 2-2 (1*85) curve changing to a 4—4 or 4-2 curve. Loomis's
lies between the 2-2 and 4-4 lines. A mean curve would, at
a concentration "02, have already crossed the 2-2 line. The
data, such as they are, are consistent with the depression-con
stant having a value of about 1"85, and would indicate single
molecules in dilute solutions, doubling of molecules at a very
early stage, and a steady increase in association throughout.
   According as H3PO4, if it exist in solution in single mole
cules, may dissociate into 4, 3, or 2 ions, will it have a 3—4,
3-3, or 3-2 curve. If it have double molecules, its curve
may be a 6-8, 6-7, &c. to 6-2 curve, according to the mode
of ionization. Jones's curve, far to the left of the 3—4 and 3-3

          On the Motion of a Sphere in a Viscous Fluid.      519
lines, runs down to the right of the 3-2 (1'85) line, bending
towards the line. Loomis's lies between the 3-2 and 6-4
lines. A mean curve would be just to the right of the 3-2
 line, and might readily run out at the 3-2 (1'85) intersection.
This would indicate single molecules in dilute solutions disso
ciating into two ions, an early occurrence of doubling of
molecules, and steady increase in the extent of association as
dilution diminished, the double molecules formed dissociating
into 4, 3, or 2 ions, but not into more. Although the co
efficients with which the curves are plotted are doubtful, the
curves are so nearly parallel to the axis of coefficients, that
even a considerable error in their determination would not
affect the above result.
                       General Conclusions.
    Although the observations on which the above discussion
is based are defective, and the particular conclusions drawn
are consequently tentative, I think it may be held with some
confidence : (1) that the curves of equivalent depression
against ionization-coefficient have positions, forms, and slopes
such as they might be expected to have on reasonable
assumptions as to mode of ionization and constitution in
solution, according to the Van 't Hoff-Arrhenius theory of
the depression of the freezing-point in solutions of electro
lytes ; (2) that they are consistent with the depression-con
stant having a common value of about 1*85 for all the
electrolytes examined, and that in the case of the electrolyte
for which we have the best data, its curve is not consistent
with a greater limit of error in this value than about 0*01,
unless improbable assumptions are made with respect to the
constitution of the electrolyte in solution; and (3) that the
diagram enables us to reach in some cases conclusions of
considerable probability with respect to the constitution of
the electrolyte in solution and its mode of ionization.

       8. Photographic Method of Determining Velocities.
IT was only possible to apply the method already described
      to cases in which the terminal velocity was small. In
order to extend the range of observation it was decided to
have recourse to a photographic method. Several ways of

520             Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion of
employing photography in the determination of the velocity
might be suggested, but the plan finally adopted was as
follows.
   A photographic plate was placed at the back of the rect
angular glass vessel in which the balls were allowed to fall.
The plate was illuminated by a series of flashes of strongly
actinic light emerging from a small aperture at some distance
from the front of the glass vessel. In this way the gliadow
of the ball was thrown upon the plate by each successive
flash, giving a permanent record of its position at the corre
sponding instant. In order to secure a succession of flashes
at equal intervals of time, twelve equidistant radial slits were
cut round the circumference of a disk, 20 centim. in diameter,
kept revolving at a uniform rate ; in the course of a revolution
each slit was brought opposite a fixed vertical slit on which
a beam of light was concentrated by a short-focus condensing
lens. It is clear that this arrangement would give a series of
images of the ball in a vertical line on the plate, but any one
image would be fogged by the light from the remaining
 flashes. To prevent such a result a metal screen having a
vertical rectangular opening was placed between the plate and
the back of the glass vessel, and the plate was drawn hori
zontally past this opening so as to expose a fresh surface to
each flash. The glass vessel, screen, and plate were inclosed
in a wooden case, in the front of which was a circular aperture
closed by a Thornton-Pickard photographic shutter to limit
the duration of the exposure.
    It will be seen that the degree of success attainable in the
measurement of the velocity depends in the first place on the
constancy of the rate of rotation of the revolving disk and
our ability to measure that rate, and in the second place on
the sharpness of the images on the developed plate.
    The first requirement was satisfied with a very high degree
of accuracy by attaching the disk, with its twelve radial slits,
to the fly-wheel of the modification of Froment's electromag
netic engine devised by Lord Bavleigh*. The motor was
 driven by a current from storage-cells rendered intermittent by
a tuning-fork interrupter making about 30 complete vibra
tions per second. The speed of rotation was obtained by
means of a counting-wheel geared to an endless screw on the
axle of the motor.
    In 36 min. 7 sees, the counting-wheel made 197 revolu
 tions. This gives exactly 11 sees, as the time of one
 revolution. The counting-wheel possessed 45 teeth, and since
                * Phil. Trans, clxxiv. pp. 310-321 (1883).

                    a Sphere in a Viscous Fluid.              521
the movement of a single tooth corresponds to one revolution
of the fly-wheel, the period of rotation of the latter is \% sec.
Hence the interval of time between two successive flashes is
lJ2 x ii Bec# or "02037 sec, very nearly 5^ sec.
    The second requirement, which is far more difficult to meet,
is that the image of the ball should show a sharply-defined
outline. To ensure this result the light should issue from as
small an opening as possible so as to avoid the formation of
a penumbra or region of partial illumination, and at the same
time the duration of the flash should be so short that no
appreciable motion of the ball takes place. In practice this
means that both the fixed and rotating slits should be as
narrow as possible.
    On the other hand, if the slits are made too narrow the
 amount of light transmitted will be insufficient to give a
 developable image.
    As the work proceeded considerable improvements were
 made in order to overcome these difficulties, and the later
 results show much greater sharpness than the earlier ones,
 although in the later photographs the balls were moving with
 greater velocities.
    Several sources of light were experimented with, but that
 which proved efficient, with the additional advantage of sim
 plicity, was a strip of burning magnesium ribbon held in
 position by a fixed clip.
    The plates used were Cadett Lightning, developed with
 hydroquinone and intensified when necessary.
    In order to find the actual and not merely the relative
 velocities of the falling spheres, it is necessary to determine
 the relation between the distances measured on the photo
 graphic plate and the distances traversed by the spheres in
 the liquid. This was done by photographing a glass scale
 suspended in the liquid in the same vertical plane as that
  passed through by the spheres in their descent. Then the
 actual velocity of a sphere must bear to the velocity obtained
 by direct measurement of the plate the same ratio as the dis
 tance between two fixed points on the scale bears to the
  distance between their images.
     The plates were measured by means of a travelling micro
  scope, the vernier of which read correctly to the tenth of a
  millimetre.
     The main features of the photographic apparatus are shown
  in section in the diagram, drawn approximately to a scale of -j^.
  The light produced by burning a strip of magnesium ribbon
  M, inside the lantern, is brought to a focus by the lens L on

  522             Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion of
  revolving disk H, driven by the Froment's engine F, and
  then in succession through the cardboard shade G, the
  Thornton-Pickard shutter E, the glass vessel C, and a rect
 angular aperture in the screen B on to the plate at A.

                           Method of Release.
    In order to obtain undisturbed motion through the liquid,
 it is clear that the sphere must be released beneath the sur
 face. Worthington and Cole* have shown that when a
 sphere is allowed to fall from air into water, a disturbance of
a large body of water takes place and the sphere carries
 down with it a bubble of air. It therefore became necessary
to devise some method of instantaneously releasing the ball
under water without giving rise to any appreciable disturbance
of the liquid, and without communicating any velocity of
translation or rotation to the ball. After trying some
mechanical devices, it appeared that by far the simplest
method was to suspend the spheres by a small straight
electromagnet. As this involved the use of magnetic material
for the spheres, it was decided to experiment with bicycle
bearing-balls. These could be obtained in six different sizes,
with diameters ranging from about 0*3 centim. to 0*8 centim.,
and careful measurements showed extremely small divergence
from true sphericity.
    The following sketch shows diagrammatically the method
employed for releasing the shutter and the falling weight
which gives the plate its horizontal motion, at appropriate
instants of time after the ball to be photographed has com
menced falling. The release is effected by a second ball
dropping in another vessel on to a light platform of aluminium

 P, P', Q are mercury keys ; R, S is a rocking-key ; and T is a trap which
         makes contact when the ball falls from D.
 and contact is made at P, P', and Q. The balls are sus
 pended from the electromagnets at C and D, through which
 the current now runs. The room having been darkened, the
  photographic plate is inserted in its sheath, and the strip of
  magnesium ribbon is ignited. When it is well alight contact
  is destroyed at Q, and the exposure proceeds automatically.
  For breaking contact at Q sets free the balls simultaneously;
  the ball falling from D makes contact at T, and a current is
 sent through the electromagnet E so that the suspended
  weight is released. This weight in its fall strikes the rocking
  key so as momentarily to give contact at S instead of R. The
  current of one cell now passes through P, S, and F, and the
  Thornton-Pickard shutter is opened.
     When the correct height of D above T has been determined
  for some one position of C, we have only to raise or lower
  0 and D by the same amount to ensure a successful exposure

 for any desired fall. In practice failures sometimes occurred,
 mainly in consequence of the contact at T having to be made
 under water, the mercury surfaces there being easily con
 taminated.
    The general appearance of the apparatus may be gathered
 from the figure (Plate I. fig. 1). The vessel in which the
 fall took place may be seen on the extreme left. In order
 to prevent the transmission of vibrations to the liquid from
 the electromagnetic engine (which cannot be seen in the
 figure), this vessel rested on a stand separated from the
 table supporting the rest of the apparatus. The aluminium
 shutter is partly visible between the front of the vessel and
 the cardboard shade. The inside of this shade, as well as
 other parts of the apparatus exposed to the light, was painted
a dull black. Immediately in front of the lantern are the
two storage-cells for working the release. On the right of
the picture is the vessel in which the timing sphere falls.
The falling weight and its release are on the side of the table
not shown in the figure.
    The experiments were carried out in a cellar in the
 Cavendish Laboratory.
                             Results.
   An inspection of the reproductions in Plates I. & II. will show
the character of the photographs obtained. Fig. 1 (PI. II.) in
 which a glass scale is photographed, shows the actual size of
the aperture in the screen. Special care was taken that the
upper and lower edges of this aperture should be sharply defined
and horizontal, so that they might serve as fixed lines from
which to measure the vertical displacements of the spheres.
Figs. 2-3 (PI. I.) & 2-4 (PI. II.) illustrate the manner in which
successive images of the aperture are formed on the moving
plate. It will be noticed that at least three flashes occurred
during the time the shutter remained open. Since the shutter
opened from above downwards, the lower part of the first image
and the upper part of the third are generally cut off. In some
of the photographs the horizontal velocity of the plate has not
been great enough to separate the images completely.
    When the falling sphere happens to be in the path of the
beam of light, we obtain two or more images of the shadow.
An examination of one of these images will show that the
opposite edge3 are most sharply defined in a direction
sloping downwards from left to right. This is a consequence
of the finite duration of a flash. The direction of the sharp
edge is that of the velocity compounded of the separate
velocities of the ball and the plate.

            9. Accelerated Motion of the Falling Sphere,
    We may conveniently consider the motion of a sphere
 falling in a viscous fluid to be divided into two stages. In
 the first stage the sphere is moving with continually diminish
 ing acceleration ; in the second it is moving with constant
 " terminal " velocity. Theoretically the second stage is
 reached only after the lapse of an infinite time, during
 which the limiting value is approached asymptotically;
 practically this stage is reached after a very short time.
    Measurement of the distance between two images on a
 plate during the accelerated motion gives the average
 velocity of the sphere in moving from one position to the
 other. This average velocity is the velocity at the middle
 of the time between the two positions, and therefore, except
 at the very beginning of the motion, is nearly the same as
the velocity at the point of space halfway between the two
positions.
    If a series of photographs of the same sphere at different
depths is obtained, we have the means of plotting a curve
showing the velocity attained after falling through any
 height. Such r curve is drawn for the smallest ball, radius

fluid displaced by the sphere, we obtain the force due to the

  terms, one arising from the motion in a viscous fluid with

    The rate at which the acceleration falls off increases
 suddenly when the velocity is about 75 cm./sec. This would
 seem to show that the law of resistance to the steady motion
 of the sphere employed undergoes a sudden change for this
 particular velocity.
                10. Terminal Velocities of Steel Balls.
    In the case of the two smallest balls, the depth of the glass
vessel was great enough to allow of the terminal, velocity
being attained. But for the larger balls it was found
necessary to increase the possible height of fall. This was
done by allowing the ball to fall through a vertical glass
tube filled with water and having its open end beneath the
surface of the water in the vessel. In order to suspend the
ball from the electromagnet hermetically fitted into the top
of the tube, and then fill the latter with water, a circular
opening was made in the side of the tube close to the top.
Through this opening the ball was introduced. Then the
aperture was closed by a rubber bung, through which passed
a short tubulure for the purpose of filling the tube by suction

528            Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion' of
   A similar tube for increasing the height of fall was pro
vided for the timing-sphere.
   In Plate I. fig. 1, one of these two tubes may be seen
supported by a retort-stand, on the extreme left of the picture.
   The dimensions of the glass vessel first used were as
follows :—length 11*5 centim., width (from front to back)
3 centim., depth 28 centim., all internal measurements. The
internal diameter of the tube used to produce a higher fall
was 2*4 centim.
   An increase in the height of fall from 34 centim. to 46
centim. produced an increase in the velocity of the largest
ball of less than 1 per cent. It was therefore assumed that
with a fall of 45 centim. (the vertical distance from the electro
magnet to the top of the rectangular aperture) all the balls
would have practicallv attained their terminal velocity. The
results are given in Table VII., but it should be noted that
the velocities of balls V. and VI. were obtained from falls of
23"9 and 21"2 centim., respectively.
   The dimensions of the balls are given later in Table VIII.

   The object aimed at in the experiments was to approach,
as far as practicable, the ideal case of a sphere falling in a
fluid of infinite extent. The width of the glass vessel in the
experiments already quoted was only four times the diameter
of the largest sphere. It might, therefore, fairly be pre
sumed that the walls of the vessel would have considerable
influence on the motion of the fluid, and consequently on the
velocity of the sphere. In order to test this point, a larger
vessel was constructed 11*5 centim. long, 6 centim. wide (from
back to front), and 21 centim. deep. A wider fall-tube was

                           a Sphere in a Viseows Fluid.                   529
    also made 4'5 centim. in diameter. The vessel was connected
    by a siphon with a large vessel of water, so as to keep the
    water-level nearly unaltered when this tube was filled by
    suction.

        The observed velocities are given in Table VIII., which
    also contains the radius and weight of each ball.
        These velocities were all obtained from a fall of more than
     34 centim.
         A comparison of these results with those already given in
    Table VII. for the same balls falling in a smaller vessel, shows
     that the effect of increasing the width of the vessel from
     3 centim. to 6 centim. is to increase the velocity by only
     about 4 per cent. Hence we may fairly conclude that in the
     larger vessel the circumstances attending the fall do not
     differ in any material respect from those in an infinite fluid
     for a corresponding fall, and that even if the velocities could
     be still further increased by increasing the size of the vessel,
     the manner in which the velocity depends on the size of the
    sphere would not be affected.
                               11. Law of Resistance.
         In order to determine from these results the relation
     between the resistance and the velocity of the sphere, re
     course was had to the method of logarithmic coordinates.
     It has been shown that if the resistance can be represented
     by a single term, it must be proportional to (aV)".
          The values of log aV were calculated and employed as
     ordinates, while the abscissce were given by the values of
    log W, since for spheres of the same density the resistance is

530               Mr. H. S. Allen on the Motion of
proportional to the weight. It was then fonnd that save for
the largest sphere the points lay almost exactly on a straight
line (fig i)*.
    The slope of the straight line on which the observed points
fall determines the value of n. The straight line drawn in
the diagram is that line passing through the point VI., for
which n=2. Hence it appears that the resistance is propor
 tional to the square of the velocity.
    Referring to § 3 we obtain
indicating that the resistance to the steady motion of a sphere
with velocity V is independent of the viscosity of the fluid.
    It should be borne in mind that this does not imply that
equal spheres moving with the same velocity in two liquids,
one of great the other of small viscosity, necessarily ex
perience the same resistance. For in the more viscous liquid
the sphere will require a greater velocity before the regime
indicated by the above law can be entered upon.
    The exceptional case of the largest sphere presents some
difficulty. The observed values of log aV fall short of those
required by the assumption of a resistance proportional to
the square of the velocity. It is scarcely possible to suppose
that any higher power than the square could be involved, for
this would necessitate a resistance decreasing with increasing
viscosity.
    Perhaps the simplest explanation is to be found in the
supposition that the influence of the walls of the fall-tube
and vessel has become appreciable in the case of this sphere,
which possesses the greatest diameter and the greatest ter
minal velocity.
    In this connexion it is interesting to recall a remark of
Sir I. Newton in a discussion of experiments on the resist
ance experienced by a pendulum oscillating in water. " I
found (which will perhaps seem strange) that the resistance
in the water was augmented in more than a duplicate ratio
of the velocity. In searching after the cause I thought upon
this, that the vessel was too narrow for the magnitude of the
pendulous globe, and by its narrowness obstructed the motion
of the water as it yielded to the oscillating globe " (Mathe
matical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Book II. Sect. vi.).
    Assuming that n = 2 we can determine the value of the
   * In the diagram (fig. 4) observations in the small vessel are indicated
by crosses, those in the large vessel by points. The latter are the more
reliable (see § 8).

                          12. Fall of an Oiled Sphere.
* f       The photograph reproduced in Plate II. fig. 4 is of special
       interest since it shows the fall through water of a sphere oiled
       with Rangoon oil. It will be noticed that the greater portion of
       the oil has collected on the upper surface of the sphere, form
      ing as it were a " tail " that follows the sphere in its down
      ward motion. The velocity of the oiled sphere found from
      this photograph was 114*5 centim. per sec, as compared
      with 120*5 centim. per sec. for the same sphere unoiled.
      The effect of oiling the sphere has therefore been to reduce
      the velocity by 5 per cent.
          No sensible change has been produced in the diameter of
      the image, so that practically all the oil must be collected
      in the tail. The volume of the tail is roughly estimated at
      *0034 cub. centim. : the total volume of oil descending with
      the sphere must certainly be less than *005 cub. centim.
      The approximate weight of the ball is *70 grm., and its
      volume *090 cub. centim., the density being about 7*8. The
      mean density of the oiled sphere, taking the upper limit for
      the volume of the oil, would be 7*2. The change in density
     would therefore be sufficient to account for the observed re
     duction in the velocity, so that it is not necessary to assume
     any change in the general character of the fluid motion.
                        13. Summary and Conclusion.
         The experiments described in this paper have had for their
     object the measurement of the terminal velocity attained by
     a spherical body falling freely in a viscous fluid. From
     these measurements it was desired to deduce the law of re
     sistance, and also to obtain information as to the existence of
     " slipping " at the boundary of a fluid mass moving in a fluid
    of different density.
        With regard to the latter point, the experiments made on
    the velocity of ascent of small air-bubbles in water and
    aniline, show that the velocity acquired is the same as would
     be attained by a solid sphere of corresponding density and
    dimensions. No appreciable slipping has been detected in
    the case of a solid in contact with a liquid. We may there
    fore extend this conclusion to the case of two different fluids
    in contact.
        It has also been shown that the law of resistance to the
    motion of a sphere moving with constant velocity in a viscous
    fluid depends on the magnitude of that velocity. Three dis
    tinct stages have been recognized.

sinuous motion on the assumption that no slipping occurs at
the boundary. In such motion the resistance is proportional
to the velocity.
    (2) When the velocity is greater than a definite critical
value, the terminal velocity of small bubbles and solid spheres
is proportional to the radius less a small constant; it may be
expressed by the formula
                        V — h(p~<T '^ a~^«
                          ~\ p ) v\
 where k = ^ and A = J approximately.
    This would indicate a resistance varying as the velocity
 raised to the power of three halves.
     (3) For velocities considerably greater than those just
 considered the law of resistance is that which Sir I. Newton
 deduced from his experiments, namely, that the resistance is
 proportional to the square of the velocity. The resistance is,
 in fact, given by the expression
                               R=fya2V2.
     In discussing the resistance during the accelerated part of
 the motion, we found indications of a somewhat sudilen change
 in the law of resistance to steady motion. This change may
 correspond to the passage from stage 2 to stage 3 above.
     In conclusion I bog to express my thanks to Professor J.
 J. Thomson for placing the resources of the Cavendish Labo
 ratory at my disposal, and for his suggestions and advice in
 the course of the work.

  ^HE appearance of a new and revised edition of this standard
  ¦*- text-book will be welcomed by all students interested in the
  subject. It is a masterly exposition by one who has himself con
  tributed in no small measure to the development of this compara
  tively recent branch of science.
     The book is divided into two parts. Part I. is subdivided into
  six sections, each section consisting of several chapters. Section 1
  deals with the fundamental laws of physical chemistry, the elements
  and their laws of combination, and the periodic law. Section 2 is
  devoted to the laws of gases and the kinetic theory. In section 3
  are considered the general properties of liquids, the phenomena of
  evaporation and condensation, the thermodynamics of liquids, their
  behaviour with respect to light, and the phenomena of surface-
  tension and viscosity. Section 4 deals with solids, crystallization,

                  Notices respecting New Books.                    535
liquefaction and solidification, isomorphism and polymorphism.
Section 5 treats of dilute solutions, osmotic pressure, diffusion, and
the phenomena connected with the vapour-pressure and the
freezing-point of solutions. Section G deals with the periodic law
of the elements, the molecular theory, and the theory of valency-
Part II., which is devoted mainly to a consideration of the
energetics of the various chemical processes, embraces the remaining
live sections of the book. In section 7 is considered the important
subject of thermo-chemistry. This is treated somewhat fully, and
a large collection of useful numerical data is given. Section 8
deals with chemical equilibrium. Electro-chemistry forms the
subject of the next section ; section 10 is devoted to photo
chemistry; and the concluding section 11 deals with chemical
affinity.
   Although the book professes to be only an outline of the subject,
it contains an enormous amount of information iu a condensed
form, and should prove extremely useful as a book of reference to
the student of physics as well as of chemistry. A good example
of the extremely conscientious and thorough manner in which the
author has fulfilled his task is afforded by chapter 3 in the first
section o.r the book, which deals with the combining weights of the
elements. Not only is there a table given of the atomic weights
according to the most recent determinations, but there is a full
account of the various methods by means of which the atomic
weights of the different elements have from time to time been
determined, the date of each research and the name of the investi
 gator being given. Similar thoroughness of treatment characterizes
 most sections of the book.
    Among its many noteworthy features may be mentioned the
 adoption throughout of a system of units based directly on the
 C.G.S. system. Thus, in the section on thermo-chemistry, the
 joule and kilojoule are adopted as heat units, and the author has
 gone to the trouble of re-calculating the large mass of data
 relating to this subject, and expressing them in terms of the
 kilojoule. It is earnestly to be hoped that in future other writers
 will follow this lead, and thereby help to remove all unnecessary
 complexity surrounding this subject.
    The clear way in which the author arrives at many of the funda
 mental conceptions of chemistry as a direct result of experimental
 investigation, and without calling in the aid of particular theories,
 Euch as the atomic and molecular theory, is highly to be com
mended, and is well worthy of very close study by all teachers of
 the subject.
   In a work of such general excellence, it is somewhat of a sur
 prise to come upon the slovenly treatment of Ohm's law on p. 377.
 After giving a definition of resistance, the author writes down
 the symbolical equation corresponding to the definition, and
 immediately afterwards states that " this is the celebrated law of
 Ohm ! " As if a mere definition could constitute a law ! In so
 doing, however, the author is only following the traditionally
 inadequate treatment of this subject. Surely it is quite as easy,

after giving the definition of resistance, to state that the quantity
so defined is, for a given conductor maintained under given physical
conditions, independent of the current. It is this constancy of
the resistance which is an experimentally verifiable and experi
mentally verified fact, and which constitutes the essence of
Ohm's law.

 -*- 1. ' Mechanically-formed Limestones from Junagarh and other
Localities.' By Dr. J. W. Evans, LL.B., F.G.S.
    After reviewing the conditions under which granular limestones
may be accumulated by current- or wind-action, the author proceeds
to describe the limestone of Junagarh, a deposit some 200 feet
thick, resembling in hand-specimens the Oolites of this country,
though less firmly cemented together. It is mainly formed of grains
consisting of a nucleus of a fragment of a marine organism or
foraminiferal test, surrounded by a layer of deposited carbonate of
lime. Particles derived from the igneous rocks of the neighbour
hood and rounded quartz-grains also occur, but amount to only
a small percentage of the rock. The whole is bound together by
colourless calcite-cement. The deposit is situate at a distance of
30 miles from the sea, and contains no large fossils of any kind.
    Calcareous rocks of similar character are described from other
parts of Kathiawar, Kach, the south-eastern coast of Arabia, and the
Persian Gulf—some of these contain unbroken marine shells and
other fossils. These beds are included by Dr. H. J. Carter under
the name of miliolite, on account of the frequent presence iu them
of the genus Miliola.
    The author discusses the origin of these deposits, and comes to
the conclusion that the grains were formed in sea-water saturated
with carbonate of lime : somo being deposited by currents in shallow
water, and others thrown up as a calcareous beach, from which a
portion were sifted out by the wind and blown inland to form aeolian
deposits, as contended by Prof. Blako in the case of certain superficial
limestones in Kach. The Junagarh limestone falls into the last
group, but. must have been formed when the land was at a low level
and the sea-shore was at no great distance.
    A rapid survey is then taken of similar rocks in other parts
of the world, which may be grouped into the same three classes.
The remarkable wind-blown foraminiferal deposit of Dog's Bay
(Galway) is referred to in some detail ; and the author concludes
by suggesting that in the Oolites of the Jurassic period we have
representatives of all three groups.

    LIII. An Electric Micrometer. By Philip E. Shaw,
 B.A., B.Sc, Lecturer in University College, Nottingham*.
                          Preliminary.
IN the summer of 1897, 1 was engaged in investigating some
     of the conditions which conduce to high efficiency and
stability in a telephone system.
   The ultimate product of the system is, of course, vibration
of the receiver-diaphragm ; so that, ceterisparibus, any change
in the apparatus, or connexions, which produces increased
amplitude of that diaphragm, makes for efficiency.
   Suppose now, for instance, that the winding of the receiver-
electromagnet is altered, then, passing in constant sound to
the transmitter, if we measure the movement of the receiver-
diaphragm before and after any such change, we shall be
able to judge of the efficacy of the change.
   Such was the idea that led to the making of the measuring
arrangement to be described, which has proved to be suitable
both in delicacy and adaptability for diaphragm movements.
                  I. Experimental Methods.
                        1. Apparatus.
  First Form.—The principle employed is to measure the exact
place of contact of two surfaces which, on meeting, complete a
circuit containing a telephone. A special spherometer was
made with great care; the disk was 8 cm.in diameter, graduated

   538                   Mr. P. E. Shaw on
   into 500 parts, the screw-pitch was £ mm.; the graduations
   were subsequently corrected against dead-hard pieces of steel
   5, 10, 15, &c. mm. long, verified by the Standards Departmont
   of the Board of Trade, the errors being very small.
     The three outer legs of the spherometer were removed and
   the frame (AB) of the spherometer was fastened firmly to the
   thick board (XX) (fig. 1), then the end of the screw (S)
                                Fig. 1.
  abutted against the long arm (CL) of a lever which was held
  against it by a spring, while the short arm (CM) carried a
  small brass rod holding in its end a platinum wire beaded
  at the end (a).
     The telephone-receiver [Rec) is firmly fastened in the
  board (XX) so that the centre of the diaphragm, which
  carries a small platinum plute, is opposite to the platinum
  bead. Then the circuit, consisting of the cell (Z), the re
  sistances (R), the observing-telephone (T), the key (K), and
  the contacts, is completed when (a) and (b) meet, which can
  be brought about by a forward or backward movement of the
  screw (S).
     As seen in the figure, the graduated disk (G) has a
  pulley on the back of it ; a cord passes round this and a
  series of other pulleys, so that the screw can be worked to
  and fro by the observer without touching the screw directly
  by hand. By the use of the pulley-string, vibrations are
  not so readily transmitted from the hand, and, moreover, by
  that means the observer can work from a convenient dis
  tance, reading the disk (G) by a telescope.
     The telephone (T) has long flexible wires, so thai the

   observer cnn have it attached to his head and hear the contact
   made, while at the same time he is watching the disk (G) for
  its position. In this manner the position of the " break " of
  contact (a) and (b) can be observed.
      Suppose now a steady current passes in the receiver (Rec),
  the diaphragm will move to a new position and remain there;
  then the observer can quite easily follow, and measure, its
  movement.
     The wooden frame carrying the apparatus was heavily
  weighted with lead and supported on soft rubber balls, to
  insulate it against vibrations.
     The ratio of the lever-arms was about 10 : 1. By using a
 telescope, each graduation on the disk (G) could be divided by
 eve into ten parts ; each of these corresponded to a movement
 of the sorew-end of ^-j^ of £ mm., or 10-5 cm., or at the
 other end of the lever to 10 ~6 cm. about.
     Second Form *.— In the next attempt (fig. 2, p. 543), the
 single brass lever was replaced by three levers of aluminium,
 working ineo-operation, so that the joint leverage ratio could
 be made 1000 : 1.
     The levers are made of aluminium bar (^ in. x ^ in. section)
 about 15 inches long ; the pivots are of steel, their ends being
 pointed to rather acute cones. The lower bearings for the
 lever-pivots are provided in brass plates let into brackets,
whilst the upper bearings are turned in the screw-ends. The
 brackets which carry these top bearings are made of stout
brass bar, bent twice at ri 'lit angles and firmly screwed to the
frame and to the wooden brackets.
    The screws mentioned be'ore have lock-nuts bearing on
the brass brackets so that the pivots can be tightened np in
their bearings as required. Each lever is balanced by a lead
weight screwed to its short arm, the object being to have the
centre of gravity of each lever over the lower bearing so as to
have no side pressure and consequent wearing of the upper and
lower bearings. The lever-ends are kept firmly in contact
with their bearings by the action of the helical brass springs
attached to the levers and to the frame ; these springs are
fairly strong, so as to render the pressure throughout the
lever-system firm and reliable in all positions.
    This point is of obvious importance, for any backlash in the
screw or looseness of the pivots in their bearings, would be
nullified by the action of the springs ; so that we should still
have firmness in the lever-system.
    The bearings by which the ends of the second lever press
on the other two are moveable, so that we can obtain different

540                    Mr. P. E. Shaw on
leverages by clamping them in different positions. The
greatest leverage thus obtainable was about 1000 : 1, and the
least about 10H : 1. A centimetre-scale was marked on the
levers, so that the clamps could be brought to any desired
position as often as recpaired.
    The arrangement for holding the telephone-receiver, on
which the experiments are made, will be described next.
    There is a massive hollow cylinder of wrought iron 15 cm.
long, 9 cm. diameter, the metal being about ¦£ cm. thick.
The telephone-receiver is screwed to a ring on the further side
of the cylinder, so that, on looking from the back, the whol*
diaphragm may be seen. There is also a screw cut on the
outeide of the cylinder, which works in a screw cut in a ring
of iron, imbedded in, and screwed to, the wooden frame.
    A lock-nut is provided so that when the cylinder has been
screwed into position it may be tightened and held rigid.
    By having such a massive and well-fitting support lor the
receiver, firmness and ready adjustability are secured for it.
    Having briefly described the essential parts of the appa
ratus, we now proceed to consider the various adjuncts
.separately.
                            2. Supports.
    The table is supported from the foundation of the building
by brick piers, vibrations passing through to the table
would be mostly of high frequency, and so should not be
transmitted by a succession of heavy masses separated by
springs and layers of indiarubber. The series was as fol
lows :— (1) Blocks of solid pure rubber on the table: (2) a
lead slab of 180 lb.; (3) four soft rubber balls; (4) a board
weighted to 50 lb.; (5) four soft rubber balls; (6) the large
 rectangular frame loaded from which hang (7) four rubber
 springs which hook on to (8) the apparatus, which is loaded
 to about 50 lb.
     The above provisions against tremors were sufficient for the
 most delicate work, provided that no violent vibrations were
 started in the neighbourhood. The motion of carts in tha
 streets, violent wind-gusts, or the working of near factory-
 machinery were fatal.
     An attempt was made to find roughly the efficiency of the
 various layers in the series, as follows. I found the vibration
 amplitude in the apparatus (1) when all the layers were in,
  (2) when the upper one was removed, (3) when two were
 removed, and so on. By actual measurement the amplitudes
 were found to be roughly (using pn as unit) :—
                ],    10,      15,      40,   100;

                     an Electric Micrometer.                   541
t. e., (1) when the apparatus was suspended from the door-
springs the amplitude was 1/i/i; (2) when the apparatus was
unhooked from the springs and rested on the other layers, we
had 10/4//, and so on.
    The above measurements show that solid rubber is more
useful than the hollow rubber balls (whose elasticity depends
greatly on compressed air), and also that little advantage is
obtained by the second layer of balls.
                           3. Covers.
    Temperature-changes in the levers, and contacts, may arise
in many ways, but especially from draughts of air and
 radiation.
    To provide against these, and also against moving dust in the
air, different wooden covers were placed over (1) the contacts,
 (2) the levers, (3) the telephone-receiver and its enclosing
 metal cylinder. After some trial those precautions, were
found inadequate ; so the whole apparatus was wrapped in
 thick felt. This covering served well, not only in main
 taining a constant temperature but also in damping sound-
 vibrations, which in some cases, before its application, produced
a chattering of the contact of about the frequency of the sounds
themselves. By taking such extensive precautions, immunity
from these disturbances was obtained, even in the extreme
case when very many gas-jets were burning in the room.
    As regards dust, it was anticipated that great trouble would
arise, for even small particles suspended in the air would be
 large compared to the smallest distances to be measured by
 the apparatus : such particles would seem likely to remain
 suspended in the air about the contacts, even after the covers
 had been put on and the air had remained calm for a long
 time. Also we might suppose that the contacts, being elec
 trically charged, would be centres of dust collection, so that
 in fact we should have a clogging of the contacts from dust,
just where it was desirable that they should be specially
 clean.
    To avoid these baneful effects, a special atmosphere round
 the contacts was provided ; air was driven at a uniform rate
 through sulphuric-acid bottles, then through cleaned cotton
 wool, then through a helical tube in a water-bath, then into the
 compartment containing the contacts. It was hoped that the
 contacts would thus have round them dry and dust-free air
 of uniform temperature. But this plan was soon abandoned,
 for this special air was found to produce comparatively rapid
 and great temperature-fluctuations at the contacts ; so that

  542                 • Mr. P. E. Shaw on
  the air-temperature was much more steady before than after
  the " remedy " was applied.
     The best plan, therefore, seems to be to give the chamber
 containing the contacts time to settle to its own state of
  temperature-equilibrium alter the covers are on.
     What part, if any, dust really plays, the author has not
 ascertained, for in all the later work it has been left out of
 account.
                           4. Contacts.
     Platinum was first used for both contacts ; but as there
 seemed to be a slight permanent yielding of the surfaces
 ¦even under the very small pressures used, iridio-platinum
 (20°/o iridium) was substituted for it and used generally
 afterwards. The iridio-platinum plate (4 mm. square) used was
 soldered to the surface of the iron diaphragm of the receiver,
fare being taken to use a small soldering-iron so as to avoid
 great heating and consequent buckling of the diaphragm.
    It was found requisite to clean the contacts thoroughly
and often, so as to keep them in good working order. When
the two surfaces are quite right, the sound heard at " make ''
and " break " is sharp, and has a clear ring ; but when not in
 good order a dull or "wheezy" sound is heard, which may in
some cases continue over a distance of as much as 10-5 cm.;
¦evidently in such a case the contact is only partial over this
distance.
    On consideration, it will be seen that this disorder may be
due to dust or oxide or other impurity on the surfaces ; but
conceivably it might be attributed to a gradual grazing contact
made between two projecting parts of the surfaces, so that
contact is not complete till the contacts are pressing one
another appreciably.
    Whatever the cause, this state of the contact must be
removed. In some cases it suffices (1) to press together and
release the surfaces several times in succession; (2) to make
and break current several times when the surfaces are in
contact; (3) to rub the surfaces (in situ) with some clean tape.
But it often happens that all such ready means fail : then
the contacts must be dismounted, polished, and cleaned as
follows :—
    Place each contact in turn in the lathe, (1) rub with the
the finest emery-paper, (2) polish with rough paste, (3) polish
with fine paste, (4) rub with caustic potash and wash, (5) rub
with hydrochloric acid and wash and dry, (H) rub well with
clean tape. A clean surface having very small roughnesses
should be the result of this process.

                       an Electric Micrometer.                 543
    It would seem desirable to produce the highest possible
 polish,- for doubtless the irregularities on the surfaces, even
 under the best conditions, are large compared with the smallest
 measurements to be made. The ideal surfaces would be a
 geometrical sphere and geometrical plane, whereas the actual
contacts would, if very closely examined, appear in point of
roughness more like mountainous regions.
                             5. Circuits.
    The simple circuit, shown in plan in fig. 1, was superseded
by one shown (also in plan) in fig. 2, where we see the
observing-receiver (Rec) and a condenser (S) put together
as a shunt to the large resistance (Rx). Another, small,
resistance (Rs) is used, and the cell (0) can be reversed.
                                 Fig. 2.
    If the circuit is completed by the touching of the contacts
(a, b), there is (1) a momentary rush of electricity to charge the
condenser, (2) a steady current of small amount through the
resistances Rt and R2. (1) soon ceases. On " breaking "
circuit, by the separation of a and b, the condenser will be ¦
discharged through Bj, and so, at the next " make," will receive
a new chiirge, and so on.
    Thus at both " make " and " break " a rush occurs through
the telephone (Rec), giving the observer evidence of them ;
the rush lasts for a very short time, but it can be made
powerful enough to serve our purpose.
    By the use of a condenser we obtain a large impulsive flow
just when required, i. e. at " make " and " break ;" hence the
contact is not disturbed by a steady flow (and consequent
heating &c.) during the interval between make and break.

544                     Mr. P. E. Shaw on
   A simple example will show the value of this method.
Consider two cases :—
       (1) S =01 mfd.
           R, = 10,000,000 o>.
           Ra=1000a>.
      E.M.F.=l-0v.
   Then, neglecting the small steady cnrrent, the quantity
passing impulsively at make is
               Q=0-lx 10-«x 1-0=10-' coulomb.
       (2) Suppose we used a simple circuit as in fig. 1 :—
           R= 100,000 ox (this is the most attained in practice).
    E.M.F.= l-0v.
   Then the quantity passing during 1 second after make
would be:—
                  Q= 10-s x 1-0= 10-6 coulomb.
   This is 100 times as large as for case (1) ; and if the sur
faces were in contact for more than 1 second, the ratio would
be even larger.
   The plan in working is to reduce S and increase Rj and R?
down to the limit of comfortable sounding of the receiver.
By this care the surfaces can be used continuously for 2 to 8
hours, whilst when not in use they seem to remain unchanged.
    Suppose that by the passage of electricity at the contact the
platinum wire rose in temperature T^ of one degree, it would
if 1 cm. long expand about 10-7 cm, t. e. one of our smallest
measurements. Hence it is that large currents are to be
deprecated.
                      6. Setting the Contacts.
    Suppose the apparatus set up, and the contacts clean, and
that we wish to get the contact position ready for taking
measurements. The observer arranges the observing tele-
Ehone (which is provided with long flexible wires) on his
  ead, puts on the cells used, and goes to the left-hand of the
apparatus (fig. 2) . He then screws up the iron cylinder with
its receiver till contact is heard, then he tightens the lock-nat
till, on gently tapping, the contact is heard to rattle ; then he
is sure that the surfaces are approximately near one another
and, probably, not touching. Then he puts on the cylinder
cover and all other covers, and takes a seat at the right-hand
end of the apparatus, where, by the motion of the pulley, be
can obtain the exact contact position, and observe the graduated
disk with the telescope.

   In the earlier observations, when the distance was required
between any two positions, they were both read and entered
 (say for instance 48-92~4D"43, diff. = 0'51), but subsequently
readings were entered always as differences ; this method was
less tedious and conducive probably to greater accuracy.
                II. Observations and Results.
   Passing now to the experimental results we have them
arranged as follows :—
   (1) Preliminary.
   (2) Calibration of the instrument.
    (3) Measurement of the diaphragm movement throughout
         the range of sound impulses, from the smallest audible
        ones to such as are very loud.
   (4) The damping of the diaphragm.
                        (1) Preliminary.
   It was necessary at the outset to ascertain whether this
contact method was delicate and consistent, and if so under
what conditions. Several months were occupied in endeavours
to obtain consistent readings of the contact position of the
diaphragm ; detail after detail was improved in the apparatus
as its requirements were discovered. Three tables will be
given as samples of the readings taken.
   Table I. explains itself (p. 546).
   Table II. shows how the displacement of the diaphragm due
to a steady current is taken. Column 2 gives the diaphragm
position before, and column 4 after current is put on. Column
3 is found by assuming the creep in contact uniform.
Column 7 shows the movement in terms of the unit ju/t (10-7
centim.). This table was obtained in earlier work, and it is
not specially accurate, but it serves to show that the readings
are very fairly consistent.
   Table III. Here a measurement was made of the throw of
the diaphragm ; the electromotive force and resistance used
are known, but, on account of self-induction in the receiver,
the current does not rise at once to its full amount. It is this
uncertainty about the action of self-induction which has
precluded the use of the throw in subsequent work.

Consecutive Readings showing the constancy of the contact-
   position under favourable conditions, and also to prove the
   small difference that exists between " make" and "break "
   under certain conditions. The last column gives the dif
   ference, if any, roughly in terms of the unit 10-7 cm.
That the readings are so very steady as a whole is due in
   great measure to the fact that they were taken in the late
   afternoon, when the temperature in the room was nearly
   stationary.

                          (2) Calibration.
   If we assumed that the screw and the divisions of the disk
were accurate in all respects, we should still have to determine
the joint leverage of the three levers in order to measure any
movement ; but by the following metbod of calibrating we
can obtain a knowledge of the value of the units on tbe disk
without making even these assumptions.
   In fig. 3 is given diagrammatically the plan of the apparatus
involved. Fix to the end of the short arm of L3 a glass plate
(a), and close to it a small lens (b) supported from the frame
of the apparatus. The plate was a microscope glass slide
chosen for its good surface ; it was held fast by a screw and
nut between tbe lever and a brass washer.
                               Fior. 3.
   The lens was let into a saw-gate in a brass bar and fixed
there by shellac ; the brass bar was clamped by screws to a
strong upright bar screwed to the wooden frame. Thus the
glass plate is fixed to the lever, and the lens is fixed to the
wooden frame, both are therefore shielded from the vibrations
of the table.
   Put up a Bunsen burner B, with sodium light and a glass
plate r to reflect the rays normally to the glass surface, then
an observer at the microscope M will, under favourable con
ditions, see at the glass surface the centre of a system of
Newton's rings. The rings can be made to open out or con

550"                    Mr. P. E. Shaw on
tract, according as the short arm of L, is moved towards or
awaj' from the observer. Suppose the rings are made to
contract by tho working of the pulleys, and that while the
observer at M sees one ring absorbed, the observer at T sees
the graduated disk move by » divs. Then the value of the
disk units in terms of the wave-length of sodium light can
be found.
    The glass surfaces (a, b) must not touch during these
observations. If the surfaces be moved uniformly together
the ring system expands at a uniform rate until they touch,
when the system begins to expand at a very much slower
rate. Thus we shall know the position of contact.
    Tho burner was surrounded by an Argand chimney, and
glass plates ^not shown in the figure) were placed between it
and the rest of the apparatus to cut off heat. It was found
well to leave the apparatus for 15 minutes after lighting up,
till temperature equilibrium was established ; then the rings
were fairly steady, and observations could be obtained.
    At first the plan was to have one observer at the te'escopo
and another at the microscope, as above described. But this
was unsatisfactory, there being a want of cooperation between
hand and eye ; so a second pulley string (s3 s3) was fitted to
pulley Pi and passed round pulley Ps so that the microscope
observer could move the ring system himself, and when the
observer at the telescope called out a reading to him he put
it down. This method of working was retained as satisfactory.
    Table IV. shows the results ultimately obtained. The rings
moved to some extent under the temperature changes (though
this movement was small when precautions were taken). But
we know about the time taken to pass from ring to ring, and
by measuring the time taken for the creep of one ring, we
can make a correction. This is the use of column 1.
    It will be seen that the four means agree very well, but
the individual values are not nearly so close ; surprise may
be felt at the considerable discrepancies, for if the apparatus in
its general use were not more reliable than in this calibration
it would not be very efficient. But the conditions in the two
cases are very different, for in calibration (1) the levers are
uncovered ; (2) the burner being near causes considerable
disturbances ; (3) to avoid a large creep during an observa
tion the levers are moved much faster than usual, which may
 cause shaking.
    The value obtained from calibration agreed closely with
 the number previously estimated by measurement of the lever-
arms.
    The band system was disturbed by the passing of a cart

                             an Electric Micrometer.                            551
     in the streets, the disturbance being visible before any sound
     of the cart could be heard.
        In every such case a delay was required.
        The value determined for one disk unit is given at the
     bottom of Table IV.

  Calibration work could not be done in the daytime ; the
working of a neighbouring factory caused a rythmic fluc
tuation of the ring system.
   Table V. gives a rough calibration for the lever system
when the bearings were so placed that the leverage was
higher. Only approximate values were obtained, for these
leverages were never used in actual measurements ; but it
was interesting to find values for the higher leverages and to
see how nearly they agreed with one another.
   The highest leverage position gives for the value of one
disk-unit the value 0*1 /t/i, which is certainly small.

                     (3) Diaphragm Movement.
    There are two distinct measurements involved : —
     A. Observe the position of the diaphragm at rest by making
 the contact ah (fig. 2, p. 543), then draw away «, and pass a
 steady current through the receiver so as to move the diaphragm
 to a new position of rest; now move up a slowly towards the dia
 phragm, watching the graduated disk and listening for contact.
 Thus we can measure the movement of the diaphragm centre
 due to a steady current. This we can do for any current down
 to such small ones as cause a movement too minute for obser
 vation ; then we shall have a relation between current in the
 telephone, and diaphragm displacements, between any desired*
 limits of the current. Plot a curve for this relation.
     B. Unscrew the telephone holder from the apparatus, fit.
 on an earpiece to it, and place the receiver in a circuit con
 taining also a cell (whose E.M.F. is known), a resistance-box
 and a tapping-key, tho receiver being shunted by another
 resistance-box.
    If the ear is placed on the receiver when the key is re
 leased a sound is heard ; this can be reduced in intensity by
 increasing resistance, or decreasing the shunt, until no sound
 is heard. Find the limit ; this gives us the lower limit of
 audibility of sounds produced in this particular way as impulses.
 Observe the current used corresponding to the limit.
    Now return to the curve obtained in A, and mark on it, by
 extrapolation, the current just found. This will give us the
 movement corresponding to the smallest audible sound
impulse.
    It must be observed that we aro dealing with an impulse,
 for the diaphragm is released from a position of strain,
 vibrates for some time under considerable damping, and so
soon comes to rest. In Section IV. an attempt is made to
represent roughly the nature of the impulse in this special case.
    The diaphragm in its vibration has its own particular
frequency, and our determination refers to this frequency.
    In all cases 1 measured my own limit of hearing (for both
ears) so that the value obtained is probably somewhat low,
as 1 have had considerable practice in listening to small
telephone sounds.
    So faint is the smallest sound that the observations were
onlv possible in the dead of night.
   Tables VI A., VII A., VIII A. give four complete sets of
diaphragm readings.
   Tables VI b., VTI b., VIII b. give the corresponding currents
for smallest sound-impulses (p. 554).

    In these curves the points are not very uniformly (lis-

      Extrapolation was used to arrive at the results ; but it
was not very hazardous extrapolation, since the curve is
merely continued to the origin, through which it obviously
passcs. • The values obtained from the curves agree very
closely, the average being 0-37 fi/i for the smallest audible
impulse.
       If this is taken as a true value, the amplitude for the con
tinuous uniform vibration audible cannot be greater than

  037 fi.fi and is probably less, Our value would seem to be a
  superior limit.
     The Tables VI A.. VII A., VI11 A. furnish not only the curves
  on fig. 4 for small displacements (0-10 ftji), but also those
 on fig. 5 lor medium displacements ( 10-160 fifi). Here
 the readings can be taken with greater percentage accuracy,
 and the points lie more uniformly along them.

     That the curves are not parallel to one another and even
 cross, as in fig. 5, is not surprising, for the receiver is set
up differently for each curve obtained, so that a small differ
 ence in the tightening of the diaphragm would make a
difference in the ratio current/displacement, and so the general
direction of the curve would be different.
    In fig. 4 the curves will be seen to be concave to the line
of absentee. Now it is obvious that for large currents the

     curve will be convex in the above sense, and we might
     reasonably expect it to be so throughout the curves to the
     origin. But if the curve when very near the origin has a
     point of flexure as supposed, we see the importance of
     plotting the curve in this region so as to obtain its true shape.
        This peculiarity might arise from (1) a " buckle " in the
     diaphragm ; (2) irregularities in the field. But we have no
     data for deciding between these various speculations.

    From the data obtained an attempt was made to draw up
roughly a scale of loudness, thus : —
    (1) Begins to be    audible                                0*4 pp.
    (2)      .,     „   comfortably loud                     50     „

    (4)      „      „   overpowering                       5000     „
    We need standards of loudness corres[>onding to our system
of standards of light-intensity. (2), (3), and (4) are only
meant to be rough indications, but (1) (which is a direct test
of the limit of hearing and does not involve the observer's
personal judgment of loudness) is much more important.
The values for it agree well together*.
                (4) The Damping of the Diaphragm.
    In Section III. a measurement is made of sound-impulses.
It is interesting, therefore, to know the nature of these
impulses, i.e. the extent to which the vibrations are damped.
    We proceed thus : — (1) Measure the position (a) of the
contact of the telephone when no current is passing in it.
(2) Pass a current in the telephone so as to draw the
diaphragm away from contact, then measure the new contact-
position (a0). (3) Draw away the contacts, and then stop
the current ; the diaphrngm will be released and will just
make contact if we arrange the pointer aright ; measure this
contact-position (a,).
    It is to be understood that a0 and a, and a„ are displace
ments from the normal position a ;                then    — =p, is the
damping factor for one £ vibration.                       a°
    For a few vibrations it seems fair to assume for our pur
poses that p does not alter much.
   Then we have for the position aftsr n half-vibrations,
   * A. Franke (see Proc. Soc. Tel. Eng. vol. xvi.) made a determination of
the amplitude of a diaphragm for the smallest sound audible. The value
obtained was l-2 up. Hut whereas it refers to a continuous sound, the
value obtained by the author refers to a sound-impulse. The method of
Franke was au interference optical one, and the smallest measured dis
placement was 52 pp ; also he seems to have trusted to having a straight
line from that point to the origin.

   From ten observations on small distances the mean value
for p was approximately \.
   Besides the work above indicated, many other measure
ments were made, viz. (1) microphone action of various
substances ; (2) the movement of the receiver-diaphragm
when in circuit with a transmitter in action ; (3) apparent
coherence of the surfaces under certain conditions.
   These applications will be reserved at present.
                            Summary.
   The main purpose of this paper is to show :—
   (1) That this method of measuring small distances by
        electric contact is reliable.
   (2) That, whereas in other methods for measuring small
        distances a limit to working is made by the size of
        some wavp-l?ngth, in this method the limit is far
        lower, is not thus dependent, and has not been reached
        in the apparatus so far made.
   (3) That a measurement can be made of the smallest audible
        impulsive sound given by a telephone-diaphragm.
   (4) That the method will probably have many other
        applications, where small measurements are involved.

for some valuable suggestions, and Professor W. H. Heaton,
M.A., for his kind interest in this research.

L1V. On the Potential Gradient in the so-called Faraday
   Dark Space of Vacuum-Tubes as Related to Conditions
  Prevalent at the Cathode.          By Clarence A. Skinner,
  Ph.D., Adjunct-Professor of Physics in the University of
  Nebraska *.
IN a former paper f results were given showing that, on
     sending a current of electricity through nitrogen at
about one millimetre pressure, the space of strikingly low
potential gradient near the anode increases in extent as the
drop of potential at the anode augments. This was attri
buted to a disturbance sent out from the anode. At the
same time it was suggested that the low gradient of the
Faraday dark space was likewise due to the " drop " at
the cathode.
   The present paper contains primarily the results of a series
of experiments, made for the purpose of studying the relation
existing between the potential gradient of this dark space
and the conditions at the cathode. The results, as will be
seen, trace the lower gradient (compared with that in the
luminous column) to cathode radiation.
   Measurements of the gradient in the Faraday dark space
were first made by Hittorf J, and recently more exhaustive
measurements have been made by Graham §. The latter
studied it in nitrogen at a definite distance from the cathode,
by measuring the difference of potential between two parallel
wires inserted respectively in two successive cross-sections of
the discharge-tube. His results gave the variation (at the
position noted) of the gradient with the current, at various
gas-pressures—the whole, however, connected with a con
siderable cathode "drop." Graham also obtained by means
of moveable wires the general form of the gradient throughout
the dark space—not, however, in its relation to the cathode,
with which this paper deals.
                             Apparatus.
   The method used was the second adopted by Graham.
Fig. 1 shows the discharge-tube sealed to an open top baro
meter-tube b, through the mercury column of which rises
one arm of a U-tube carrying the exploring-wires, while
the other arm passes to the outside through the reservoir
below (not shown). By this means the exploring-wires are

the electrometer passes, air-tight,
through the U-tube.            The dis
charge-tube is jointed in the middle,
thus allowing the exp'oring-wires
to be adjusted, and the electrodes to
be exchanged.          Its diameter is
about 40 mm., and the distance be
tween the electrodes 145 mm.
   Observations were made in nitro
gen only. This was prepared lrom
air and purified after the method
of Hittorf *, freed from the lust
trace of oxygen by nascent sodium t,
and thoroughly dried in a chamber
containing phosphorus pentoxide.
Spec al effort was made to re
move all trace of moisture, which
seems to be the cause of much un
certainty in vacuum-tube discharge.
For this purpose a tube of phos
phorus pentoxide was placed between
the Rapps automatic air-pump and
the rest of the system of apparatus,
and another of calcium chloride
between the pump and the aspi
rator. In addition, only dry air was
allowed in contact with the mercury
used in pumping. Leakage was
guarded against by securing all
ground joints with mercury (except
ing ihe discharge-tube, the joint of
which proved absolutely air-tight).
It is believed that these precautions
insured a degree of constancy, with
a rate of operation, which in vacuum
discharge is exceptional. The electric current was produced
by a battery of 600 secondary cells, and measured by a
Weston milliammeter (scale-divisions in tenths). All potential
measurements were made by a Thomson quadrant electro
meter carefully insulated, while seuling-wax insulators and

          the Faraday Dark Space of Vacuum- Tubes.           565
paraffin switch-blocks were used throughout. Potentials of
the magnitude of the cathode " drop " were made by charging
the quadrants with a Clark standard cell and the needle with
i he potential to be measured.          A Hittorf cadmium-iodide
resistance * was used to regulate the current, the continuity
being tested by the receiver of a telephone.
                         Preliminary Tests.
   To provide an experimental check on results, two vacuum-
tubes were fitted out, alike in all respects, and in open
connexion with each other.           Observations made in one
could thereby be repeated immediately afterwards in the
other.
    Platinum exploring-wires (diam. two-tenths ram. ; distance
apart 3"5 mm.) were first used, but the gradients obtained
 from the two tubes seldom agreed. Furthermore, when the
current was reversed, the constant gradient of the luminous
 column appeared often greatly increased (or diminished). A
discharge sent from the exploring-wires as cathode tended to
 reduce these discrepancies, thus proving that they arose
 from the condition of the surface of the wires.
    Aluminium wires (of same diameter and distance apart as
the platinum) were tried, gave very constant results, and were
subsequently used, making check-observations in the second
tube in general unnecessary.          The gradient indicated by
these was regularly about 35 per cent, above that calculated
from the difference of potential observed between the extre
mities of the luminous column. This discrepancy is probably
due to a local disturbance of the discharge caused by the
 presence of the wires.
    Circular disks of polished iron were used as electrodes.
To allow for a considerable variation in the current strength
with the cathode " drop " constant, it was found necessary to
give these a diameter of 30 mm.
                       Faraday Dark Space.
    In Tables I., II., and III., the values of the gradient for
various currents and different gas-pressures are given.
These all refer to a constant drop at the cathode of about
320 volts. The observed gradient is reduced to volts per
centimetre, and the positions arc as indicated in fig. 1.
Though these tables are chosen as the best from several series
 of observations, at various eas-pressures, yet results obtained
 at different times under the same conditions varied never
 more than ten per cent., and usually no more than five.

       While this gives the positive boundary of the Faraday dark
       space (within an error of observation of possibly 5 mm.), it
       was also noted that the negative boundary of this space could
        be located as at the second intersection of 11 with the
       gradient, as it rises rapidly near the cathode. (The negative

             The full-line curves represent the results obtained with a
       luminous discharge, while the dotted curves refer to the dark
       discharge, produced by increasing the current to a value such
       that the luminous column was diiven back into the form of a
       disk on the face of the anode.
             Considering first the gradient for the luminous discharge,
       it may be observed that, with increasing current the Faraday
       dark space increases in extent, driving the luminous column
       before it ; this is accompanied by a decrease in the gradient
        throughout the dark space. To this conclusion the results
        show a single exception, seen in fig. 3, in which the curves
        for 1*5 and for 3 milliamperes coincide.                             This exception,
        which led to an explanation of the cause of the dark space, is
        considered in another paragraph.
             It is also seen that the less the extent of the dark space from
        tlie cathode, the greater the rate of increase in extent with //<*¦
       current.
             Again, with increasing gas-pressure, the dark space for the
       same current decreases in extent.
             As found by Graham (loc. cit.) and corroborated lately in
        the results of H. A. Wilson *, the gradient drops to a very
        low minimum immediately before its rapid rise near the
       cathode. These curves show, however, that although with the
     'larger currents this minimum approaches a zero value, yet with
                          * H. A. Wilscn, Phil. Mng. xlix. p. 505 (June 1900).

a very small current and higher gas-pressures it may reach a
considerable value. Graham's curves show on the whole two
minima in this space separated by a smull maximum. Those
of Wilson show this maximum exceptionally marked. With
a cathode 2 centim, in diameter, I observed likewise a small
maximum between two minima, but with the larger cathode
(diam. 3 cm.) the maximum was at no time detectable, thus
indicating it as probably dependent on the density of the
discharge from the cathode-surface.
    As to the range over which the observations extended, it
maybe stated that they were made for gas-pressures inter
mediate between, as lower limit, the pressure at which the
luminous column is still unstriated (about "G mm.), and as
upper limit (2 mm.), the power-limit of tho battery. The
current ranged from the lowest possible to that which produced
the dark discharge. The difficulty attached to the main
tenance of small constant currents lies probably in the unstable
condition of tho conducting gas, as seen in the variation
in the total drop of potential between the electrodes with the
current. The total drop of potential throughout the con
ducting gas, being proportional to the area contained between
the gradient and the axes of coordinates, is seen with small
currents especially to decrease rapidly with increasing current ;
and the reverse, increases rapidly with decreasing current.
Thus the action of the gas is to magnify any variation in the
 rest of the circuit, and to lend itself, with a capacity and high
 resistance in the circuit, readily to a pulsating discharge.
 Another difficulty in maintaining constant small currents
 arises when the discharge, taking place from smaller and
 smaller surfaces of the cathode as the gas-pressure increases,
 being reduced to a spot on the cathode, dances rapidly about
 over its surface.
    Returning to the fact that the curve in fig. 3 for 3 m.a.
 coincided throughout with that for 1*5 m.a., it was noticed
 at the same time that, with the current very slightly above
 1*5 m.a., the discharge began to take place from the back
 surface of the cathode also. This suggested that the dark
 space was under the dirsct influence of a radiation from the
 diseharging-surface of the cathode. To test this point the
 cathode was turned, as shown in fig. 5, with its plane lying
 in the axis of the discharge-tube, so that any disturbance
 sent out normal to its surface would be directed against the
  walls of the tube. In addition, any component radiation
 along the axis of the tube was prevented by a glass cylinder
  which surrounded the cathode co-axially.
     Under these conditions the luminosity, with an unstriated

570      Dr. 0. A. Skinner on the Potential Gradient in
discharge, appeared as outlined by the dotted lines in the;
figure. The luminous column extended up near the open
end of the cylinder and held there tenaciously for all cur
rents up to 5 and 6 m.a., not retreating as much as a centi-
metre at any time. A permanent horse                         Fig. 5.
shoe magnet held so that cathode rays would
be deflected upwards caused the luminosity
to retreat slightly, while the reverse posi
 tion caused it to extend.          The potential
 gradient in the luminous column rose
 slightly in passing from anode to cathode,
 more rapidly in the constricted portion than
 in the other. With the striated discharge,
 while the luminosity did not extend up to
 the cylinder-screen, but to about 3 cm.
 above it. it required a current considerably
  larger than tinder ordinary circumstances
 to cause it to retreat perceptibly towards
  the anode. The striations were in this case
  of keener outline and more intense lumi
  nosity on their negative face. With both
  striated and unstriated discharge, by simply
  reversing the current, so that the cathode
  was above, the luminous column was quickly
  driven behind the cylinder screen, the
  change being accompanied by a consider
  able increase in the current. These results
  indicate that the Faraday dark space is
  under the influence of a radiation emanating
  directly from the discharge-surface of the
  cathode, rather than from a secondary dis
   turbance produced by the discharge in the
   neighbouring gas.
     The results embodied in the curves already
   considered, appear entirely in agreement with the conclusion
   that the Faraday dark space is swept by cathode rays, which
   are conceived as the negative ions driven forth with a velocity
   acquired through the excessive " drop " at the cathode, and
   giving up their kinetic energy in ionizing the gas through
   which they drive. All the curves (that for '8 m.a., fig. 4,
   possibly excepted^ show, in their convexity to the axis of
   abscissas throughout the dark space, that, according to
   Prof. J. J. Thomson *, ionization is in excess there. There
   is a considerable region, however, lying next the luminous

          the Faraday Dark Space of Vacuum- Tabes.          57 L
column, where this convexity is very slight, yet from the
 fact that it disappears when the cathode rays are turned
aside, it must be considered as under the control of cathode
 radiation.
    In connexion with these considerations, the curves of
 H. A. Wilson (loc. cit.) showing the electric conductivity of
 the gas normal to the direction of the current are of special
 interest. According to these the conductivity of the Faraday
 dark space increases in passing towards the cathode, which
 agrees with the decreasing gradient, and with an increasing
 ionization as the source of the cathode rays is approached.
 Passing in the opposite direction through the dark space
 into the luminous column, while the gradient shows that the
conductivity decreases gradually to a constant minimum in the
luminous column, a certain region in the dark space is reached
 where, on the other hand, the conductivity in a direction
 normal to the current becomes a minimum, then rises to a
constant value in the luminous column. Were the conduc
tivity dependent on the degree of ionization alone, it should
be independent of the direction in which it is measured.
Some other factor evidently enters to which this difference
must be ascribed.
    While Wilson suggests it to be due to the luminosity
ionizing the gas at the surface of the " cross-current "
electrodes, and thus, for the same difference of potential
between them, allowing a larger " cross-current " to pass in
the luminous portions than in the dark spaces ; it may also
be explained from the conclusion that cathode rays are active
in producing the dark space. This explanation rests upon
the assumption that the negative ions driving through the gas
 with a decreasing velocity, cease to ionize it while their
velocity is still above that maintained by them in the luminous
column. Since the conductivity in uny direction (other
conditions remaining the same) must increase with increased
velocity of the ions in that direction, the conductivity along
the discharge, in the higher velocity non-ionizing region of
the negative ions, would be greater than in the luminous
column, and also greater than in a direction at right angles
to the discharge in the same region. Furthermore, with the
same degree of ionization in the luminous column as in this
region, the conductivity at right angles to the direction of
motion of the ions would be lower in the latter, due to the
stream tending to carry them past the limited " cross-field."
It seems possible that, with a sufficient velocity of the ions
along the direction of the discharge, the conductivity at right
angles might be reduced without limit.

572     Dr. C. A. Skinner on the Potential Gradient in
                    Gradient near the Anode.
   We have in (lie above results an explanation of the low
gradient, near the anode also. The positive ions driven forth
with a velocity imparted by the anode "drop" render the
space in which the higher velocity is maintained more con
ductive thereby in the direction of their motion. That these
do not ionize the gas through which they drive, but on the
other hand increase the conductivity at right angles, may be
seen in the fact that (as given by Wilson) the curve of
conductivity drops to a very small value in this space.
   The potential gradient near the anode in figs. 2, 3, and 4
reaches a minimum, though not a zero value as found earlier
and also corroborated by Wilson. The drop of potential at
the anode was normal (18 to 25 volts), so that this dis
crepancy is probably to be attributed to the large discharge-
surface of the anode used in this investigation.
   Another observation made in connexion with the anode is
of interest, in that it concerns a questionable state of the gas
near the anode. As lias been noted in the earlier communi
cation by me, and more thoroughly studied by Wilson, with
striated discharge the gradient in the striation on the anode
is apparently negative. With the larger anode used in this
investigation the same has been observed in an unstriated
discharge, though not always. In one case the minimum
potential-difference between the anode and the first exploring-
wire was obtained with the wire at a distance of one centi
 metre from the anode. This increased perceptibly as the
wire approached the anode, while at the same time a shadow
 of the wire was cast on the face of the anode. A neia'ive
 gradient was thus indicated, yet the gradient indicated by the
 exploring-wires was a considerable jmniive quantity. The
 discrepancy in this case must be attributed to a disturbance
 of the discharge at the anode hv the proximity of the
 exploring-wires. This strengthens then the view that former
 similar results were due to the same cause, rather than that
 there is actually a negative electric intensity in the sp;ice
considered.
                            Striations.
   In fig. 2 the curve for 4 m.a. represents the gradient for
a clearly-marked striated discharge produced by simply
increasing the current above 2 m.a. It was repeatedly
observed that with the pressure of the gas near tlie limit
between the striated and unstriated discharge, the latter could
he converted into the former by increasing the current —like
wise the reverse. This change is gradual. With a pressure of

about "4 mm. the current at which the transformation took
place was smaller than in this case, while at lower pressures
only the striated condition was observable. These observa-
lions are of possible interest in connexion with the theory of
J. H. Jeans*, who deduces the curve for a striated discbarge
from the conditional equations of Prof. J. J. Thomson
 (loc. cit.) under the assumption that the density of the ions
shall remain finite.
    The explanation, given above, of the difference in conduc
tivity along, and at right angles to, the direction of the
discharge may be briefly applied to the striated discharge.
Wilson found the curve of conductivity at right angles to
possess maximum values in the luminous parts and minimum
in the dark spaces, which is exactlv opposite to the curve of
conductivity along the discharge (as given by the potential
gradient), where the dark spaces possess maximum conduc
tivity. Thus we find maximum and minimum for one
direction, coinciding respectively with minimum and maxi
 mum taken at right angles thereto.
    We may assume that the ions possess a zero velocity at
 right angles to the direction of the discharge. Then, sup
posing the degree of ionization constant, the regions of
 maximum velocity along the discharge will be, due to this
velocity, regions of maximum conductivity along, and of
minimum conductivity at right angles.
    If we suppose the velocity of the ions constant throughout,
 then regions of maximum conductivity in both directions will
 coincide with regions of maximum ionization, and with each
 other. The latter condition is impossible because contrary to
 experimental results. If we suppose maximum ionization in
 the luminous and minimum in the dark spaces, the velocity
 in the latter must be sufficient to compensate for the minimum
 ionization there, so that the conductivity along the discharge
 may be greater in the dark spaces, as the gradient requires.
     If, lastly, we suppose, according to Prof. Thomson, maxi
 mum ionization in the dark spaces, the velocity there must be
 sufficient to produce minimum conductivity at right angles.
    All three possible cases require a greater velocity of the
 ions in the dark spaces than in the luminous. This is of
 interest in connexion with the theory of Spottiswoode and
 Moulton f, that the current is transmitted by successive dis
 charges across the dark spaces, from which a greater velocity
 of the ions in these spaces would logically follow.

   The gradient as given in the full-line curves in figs. 2, 3,
and 4 is single-valued for a cyclic variation of the current, so
long as its strength is kept below a certain value. If it rises
above that value, the luminous column, under constant current,
gradually retreats into a thick disk on the anode, giving the
^o-called dark discharge. The dotted curves in figs 2 and 4
(for 6 m.a.) represent the gradient after this change had
been brought about ; the one in fig. 3 represents it during
the transition, in which the luminous column extends (as in
the full-line curves) from the anode -to the intersection of the
gradient with the line 11 . Alter the dark discharge has set in,
the gas requires a certain period to recover the power of
transmitting a current by the luminous discharge. In one
case the gas was observed to recover its natural luminosity
and normal gradient within half an hour after the current was
broken; but in general, the longer the period of dark dis
charge, the longer the period required for recovery. Two to
three hours was always sufficient to recover both luminosity
and gradient.
    With the cathode screened as in fig. 5, the dark discharge
could not be produced by double the current (10 to 12 m.a.)
usually necessary when the cathode was discharging along
the axis of the tube. This, in connexion with the fact that
the dark discharge is ushered in, as it were, by a growth of
the Faraday dark space, indicates -that the transition from
the luminous to the dark discharge is at any late largely
facilitated by cathode radiation.

   As already stated, the line 11 marks by its intersection
with tlie potential gradient the limit of the unstriated luminous
column. It may be observed in the curves given, that where
the gradient falls twenty-five per cent, (roughly estimated)
below its constant value in the luminous column, that region
is dark. It was also noticed in this connexion, that as the
gas recovered from the dark discharge, the luminosity in
creased, as the gradient having risen above 11, approached
its normal value.

    LV. 2?ote on a Possible Source of Error in the Use of a
       Ballistic Galvanometer. By R. Beattie, B.Sc*
UNLESS more than ordinary care is taken in setting up>
        a ballistic galvanometer of the movable magnet type,,
the chances are that the magnetic axis of the needle does not
lie exactly in the plane of the coil. Whenever this is the
case, the magnetic field set up in the galvanometer during the
passage through it of a quantity of electricity lias a component
along the needle's length tending to alter temporarily its
magnetic moment, and so tending to modify the throw—
causing it to be in defect of a normal throw when the needle
in its first swing passes through the plane of the coil, in
 excess when it does not. If we admit that the change, sup
posed small, in the magnetism of the needle is at each instant
 proportional to the component of the field in the direction of
 the needle's axis, we can readily find an expression for the
 amount of the error which is thus introduced. For it is then
 not difficult to show that the throw is proportional, not to the
 quantity Q of electricity which traverses the galvanometer,
 but to

 may not, on occasion, be so large that it cannot be entirely
 disregarded.
    The value of the coefficient a which enters into (1) is not
 easily assigned ; it may be very large or it may be very small.
  Since it is equal to the susceptibility of the needle corre
 sponding to the application and removal of a small magnetic
 force, divided by its intensity of magnetization ; and since
 the former of these quantities increases as the latter dimin
 ishes ; we see that a will be small if the needle is strongly
 magnetized, but large if the needle has lost a good deal of its
  magnetism. For the present purpose it will be sufficient to

 For a very sensitive galvanometer wound with copper wire
the ratio G/R, expressed in C.G.S. lines per sq. cm. per
ampere per obm,will probably not differ much from unity.
For such a galvanometer, therefore, with its needle dis
placed 1° the error would be only 1 per cent, when
 E = G00 volts. But in a less sensitive galvanometer wound
 with thicker wire G/R may be far larger than unity *—may
be as much as 100 in fact; in which case a difference of po
tential of (i volts and a displacement of the needle of 1° would
 suffice to produce an error of 1 per cent, in the throw. A
galvanometer in which G/R is as large as 100 is not, it is true,
sufficiently sensitive to be well adapted for conden«er work ;
 still, with a weak enough controlling field it will give a

   560         Dr. C. Davison on St-a- Waves connected
   exception of a report presented to the Japanese Government,
   of which no adequate summary has, I believe, appeared in any
   European language. In the present paper, I shall therefore
   confine myself to considering the propagation of the sea-
   waves in an easterly direction, one of my objects being to
   compare the mean depth of the ocean as obtained by sound
   ings with that obtained from the formula usually employed
                              */Q7H) = V,
   where H is the uniform depth of the ocean in which waves
   would travel with the same mean velocity V as that of the
   seismic sea-waves. I have shown in a previous paper* that
   the value so found must be considerably less than the true
   mean depth ; the calculated value in a particular case con
   sidered being 1900 fathoms instead of 2420 fathoms, i.e.
   about £ of the real value.
       In tig. 1 are shown the parts of Central and Northern
   Japan that were chiefly affected by the earthquake, the town
    of Kamaishi being practically destroyed by the sea- waves.
    The continuous curves represent isoseismal lines. Within
    the curve marked 2, the shock was "weak," the motion
    being well-pronounced, but not sufficiently severe to cause
    general alarm ; between the two curves 1 and 2 the shock
    was " slight," and only just strong enough to be felt. The
    dotted curves are sub-oceanic contour-lines, the figures
    annexed to each giving the depth in fathoms. According to
    Mr. T. Iki, the epicentre was situated in lat 39° N. and
    long. 144° 30' E., or about 240 km. E.S.E. of Miyako. It
    is indicated on the map by a cross, and lies at a depth of
    4000 fathoms near the foot of the western slope of the Tusca-
    roora Deep.
       Prof. Omori informs me that the surface- velocity of the
    earthquake-waves within the disturbed area was about 2"7 km.
    per second, and, as the time of occurrence at Miyako was
    7h. 32m. 30s. P.M. (mean time of 135° E.), this would give
    7h. 31m. (or l()h. 31m. a.m., G.M.T.) as the approximate
    time at the epicentre. This result is probably correct to
    within a minute.
       Though I made inquiries at all the harbours known to me
    where self-recording tide-gauges are established, records of
    the sea-waves appear to have been obtained at only two
    stations, namely, Honolulu and Sausalito (San Francisco Bay).
     Copies of these records are given on a reduced scale in fig. 2

    On Sea- Waves connected with a Japanese Earthquake.              583
houses, throwing down stone walls, &c. It was reported
from there that an extraordinary fall or recession of the
sea preceded the greatest wave. No accurate observations
seem to have been made in those localities of the times and
the number of the prominent waves."
   The record at first shows a steady rise and fall of the water;
and it is not until 7h. 37 m. a.m. on June 15 that any change
occurs. There is then a small rise of about J of an inch, the
first crest reaching the gauge at 7h. 43m. (?'. e. at Gh. 15in. p.m.,
G.M.T.). For about two hours this motion is somewhat irre
gular ; but between 9h. 55m. A.M. and 5h. 8m. p.m. on
June 15 there is a group of 17 waves with an average period
of 25£ minute-s. The waves are all small; they are most
marked between 9h. 55m. a.m. and lh. 40m. p.m. ; and even
then the mean distance between crest and hollow of suc
cessive waves is only 1'2 inches. The copy of the record closes
at 8 P.m. on June 17, when the surface of the water shows
signs of returning to its normal steadiness.
   The distance between the epicentre and Honolulu, mea
sured along a great circle, is 351)1 miles ; and, the time-
interval being 7h. 44m., it follows that the mean velocity
was 681 feet per second. If the ocean were of uniform depth
between the two points, the depth corresponding to this mean
velocity would be 14,492 feet.
   Sausalito (lat. 37° 51' N., long. 122° 29' W.).—Sausalito
lies at the entrance to San Francisco Bay. At the time of
the earthquake, the gausre here was the only automatic gauge
in operation on the Pacific coast of the United States. The
scale is "93 inch per hour for the horizontal coordinate (mea
sured from the copy of the record), and 1 inch per foot for
vertical displacement. The time is the Pacific standard, that
of the 120th meridian west of Greenwich.
   In this, as in the Honolulu record, the first evidence of any
change is a rise (of 3"7 inches) in the level of the water*,
beginning at 12h. 53m. p.m. on June 15, the first crest reach
ing the gauge at lh. 5m. p.m. (i. e. at 9h. 5m. p.m. G.M.T.).
During the first two hours, the waves are larger and of longer
{>eriod than those which follow, the chief movement being
 >etween lh. 30m. and 1 h. 45m. p.m., when the water rose
6*8 inches and fell 2"2 inches. After this, they become more
regular. Between 3 and 6 P.M. there are 30 waves, with an
average period of 6 minutes and a mean distance between

fIunasaki-niura, the first movement was a fall in the level of the water.

 584                   Mr. S. H. Burbury on t/ie
 crest and hollow of successive waves of 1*5 inch. At 1 A.M.
 on June 17, when the copy of the record ends, there were
 still verv distinct sijms of movement due to the Japanese
 eartnquake.
    The distance from the epicentre to Sausalito is 4787 miles,
 the time-interval is lOh. 34 m., and the mean velocity between
 the two places 6(54 feet per second. On the same assumption
 as before, the mean depth of the ocean would be 13,778 feet
    Mean Depth of Pacific Ocean as ascertained from Soundings.
 — I have e.-ti mated roughly the depth of the ocean along the
 two lines from the epicentre to Honolulu and Sausalito,
 making use for the purpose of the .Physical Chart of the
 World which accompanies the " Narrative " of the Voyage
 of H. M.S. 'Challenger'*.
    The epicentre-Honolulu line traverses a part of the ocean
 whose depth is very variable : indeed, the long chain of
 islands of which the Hawaiian Islands form the eastern end
 almost lies along the great circle joining the two places.
 Alone the most direct course which the wave might take, the
 mean depth is about 13.500 feet. But along a very slight
 deviation from this line the depth is much greater ; and it is
probable that the earliest waves which reached Honolulu
would take some such course. It is therefore useless to com
pare this result with that obtained above from the velocity of
the seismic sea-wave.
    Along the epicentre-Sausalito line the conditions are very
 different. The great circle joining the two places is entirely
 free from islands, and crosses the sub-oceanic contour-lines
approximately at right angles. The mean depth along this
line is more than 17,000 feet, while that obtained from
 the formula is 13,778 feet, or about $ of the measured value.

                    Law of Partition of Energy.               585
  or the mean kinetic energy is the same for each degree of
  freedom.
     In this paper I propose to deal with the theory only as it
  relates to velocities of translation. If the system consist of
  molecules having masses M and m, and if U, u are their
  respective velocities, then the law of equal partition assumes
  the form
                          m«« = MlP = &c.
     2. A necessary qualification.—The energy of translation
  which is to he the subject of equal partition will be under
  stood not to include that of any common velocity which the
  molecules may have —for instance the earth's motion in
  space—or of any sensible stream motion. I maintain further
  that in addition to sensible streams there exists generally
  what may be called a molecular stream — that is, that
  molecules very near each other in space have on average
 a certain velocity in common. But. that this applies only
 to distances comparable with the dimensions, or with the
 radius of action, of a molecule. It cannot therefore, any
 more than individual molecules themselves, be the subject
 of observation. The existence of such molecular streams is,
 as I maintain, when intermolecular forces exist or the
 molecules have finite dimensions, an analytical condition of
 stationary motion.       If that be true, we may perhaps find
 that the energy which is to be the subject of partition
 should be exclusive of the energy of the molecular stream
 as well as of the energy of all sensible streams.
                      The necessary Condition.
    3. It is a necessary condition for our law that the motion
 be stationary. But that is not a sufficient condition, for it is
 possible to construct systems which are in stationary motion
 without satisfying the law. As, I think, Lord Kelvin has
 done in his "decisive test case.''       Some other condition
must then be satisfied besides that of stationary motion.
What is that other condition ? Before we can either prove
or disprove the law, we require an enunciation of it. '
    So far as I know we have only to choose between Max
well's condition (Cambridge Phil. Soc. Trans, xii., p. G48)
and Boltzmann's, as given in his Vorltsungen iiher Gas
 Theorie. Let us first consider Maxwell's, as expounded by
Lord Rayleigh in Phil. Mag. January 1900.
                       Maxwell's Condition.
   4. Maxwell and Bayleigh maintain that the only assump
tion necessary for the truth of the law is that the system, if
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 50. No. 307. Dec. 1900.       2 T

586                  Mr. S. H. Burbnry on the
left to itself, will sooner or later pass through every phase
consistent with the conservation of energy (MaxwellV paper,
p. 548). It must therefore sooner or later return to its first
state, the motion heing in fact cyclic. Farther the motion
is evidently reversible.
    5. The line of argument is sufficiently shown in Bayleigh's
treatment (Phil. Mag. January 1D00, pp. 102-107) of the
system of particles moving in two dimensions in a field of
force.      He defines as follows : — (1) If x, y denote the
coordinates, w, v the component velocities of a particle, then,
when x y u v lie within the limits x . . . x + dx
 v . . . v + dv, the particle is in the phase {x y u r).
 (2) f(xyuv) dx fly dude is the number of particles which
 at any instant are in the phase (x y u r). The path of any
 system, and of any one of Bayleigh's particles as a particular
 case, is the series of successive states through whicb the
 system passes in unguided motion with total energy constant.
 The path in which the total energy is E may be called the
 path E. Then, argues Bayleigh, the particles which at. a
 given instant (t = 0) are in the phase (.r y u r) are the
 identical particles which will at time t be in the phase
 (./ y' u' r'), and no other particles will at time / be in the
 last mentioned phase. Thereforo
          f(x y u v)d.r. dy du dv — f(.r' y' u v'}dx'dy'du'dv'.
 But by a known theorem, which owes much to Bayleigh,
                      dx dy du dv = dx'dy'du'dv'.
 Therefore
            f{x y u v) =/{x' xfxi' v), or shortly /=/'.
 That is, the number of particles which initially are in the
 phase (x y u v) is equal to the number which after time I
 will be in the phase (x' y'u' v'). If therefore there be at the
 initial instant the same number of particles in every phase
  of the path E, the motion will as regards these particles be
  stationary.
     In stationary motion, then, /is constant for all phases on
  the same path.       E is also constant for all phases on the
  same path, and we will assume for the present with Bayleigh
  that it is the only other constant. We will now assume
  that there are many particles on the same path for each of
  which E is constant, and many paths for each of which /and
  E are constants, and no other thing is constant; but E, and it
  may be /, will vary between one path and another. It
  follows that / is a function of E. Now E = V + T, where
   V is a function of the coordinates, and T, the kinetic energy,

                  Law of Partition of Energy.               58?
 is a qnadratic function of the velocities which define a phase
 for the s ime particle, and of those velocities only. That is,
 given x and y, f is a function of (m2 + r2) . It follows that
 for each of Rayleigh's particles u' = r2.
    6. But if particles of ons system have mass m, and
 those of another system m', and their respective velocities
are w w', no conclusion can be drawn as to the relation
hetween inn* and m'u".           For we have two alternatives r
 (1) The particles do not undergo collisions or encounters
with each other, whereby a particle would gain or lose
energy, and so change its path ; or (2) such encounters do
take place. If we choose alternative (1), every distribution
of energy between the classes in and m' is permanent. If
we choose alternative (2), the method fails to prove that
f = f, and is inapplicable.
    7. Rayleigh's method is easily generalized as follows: —
Instead of a particle movinjj in two dimensions, the system
may be a particle or elastic sphere in three dimensions.
Or it may be defined by a generalized coordinates </x . . . y,
with the corresponding momenta />, . . . />„. And we may
denote by /(</ /<)</</) . - • dj\ tiie number of systems which
are in the phase (</ j>). Jt then follows on precisely the
same conditions as in the case of the particles in two dimen
sions, that f is constant throughout a path. Also E. is
constant.     And if E be the only other constant, / is a
function of E, that is of V + T, say/ = </>(E).
    In thi3 general case Rayleigh argues that T can always be
expressed in terms of squares of the velocities, as
                    T = A,-},* + A2y,2 + &c.
I pass over this discussion, because it does not concern
translation velocities, with which alone I am dealing. Hence
follows, that if y, <y2 &c. define a phase of any system,
                        A,y? = AjYj* = &c.
The result is proved — if it is proved—onlv for velocities
which belong to the same system, while each system fulfils
Maxwell's condition.
    8. If therefore we are to prove by Rayleigh's method
that, for different masses m and M, mtf'=MU1, we must
make « and U velocities of the mine nystem, one of a class
of svstems to which Maxwell's principle is assumed to apply.
I take the simplest case. The system consists of two elastic
spheres whose masses are m and M, and whose velocities
are u v w and U V \V respectively. To simplify matters
further, we will assume the field of force to be uniform.
                                2T2

588                 Mr. S. H. Burba ry on the
    If the two spheres composing a " system '' collide with
each other, the " system " remains on the same path before,
during, and after that collision, only the phase changing.
But if either sphere collides with a third sphere, the " system "
changes its energy, and therefore its path. In this case no
pair of spheres or " system " passes on the same path through
all phases consistent with conservation of energy. Rayleigh's
argument is therefore inapplioableto systems of this description.
    9. It is to be noted also that, even if we regard the system
only while it continues on the same path, during an interval
which includes a collision between m and M, the reasoning
still fails because E is not the onlv constant before and after
collision. The square of the relative velocity R of m and M
is also constant, namely
                R*=(u-U)*+(r-Vf + (w-W)».
 Therefore /is a function, not of E only, but of E and R*.
     And for the same reason I think it must fail as applied to
 the translation velocities of any group of spheres, because E
 will always have a companion constant representing conserva
 tion of momentum.
     It is useful here to compare Rayleigh's equation /=/
 with that which Boltzmann obtains in the corresponding case,
 namely F/=F'/'. In Boltzmann's notation F, F' relate to
 M spheres before and ;ifter collision, and f. f similarly relate
 to m spheres. Rayleigh's equation admits of solution in the
 form
 where A and K are constants. Boltzmann's equation admits
 of no solution for our present purpose except
                            F/=Ae-*T.
      Boltzmann, if his fundamental assumptions are true,
  proves the law mim8 = MU~*, while Rayleigh's method if
 applied to any finite group of spheres as a " system" fails to
 prove it.
     10. In order rightly to apply Rayleigh's argument, we must
 treat as one ''system " all the elastic spheres (if our mole
  cules are such) in the field. Or it must be a material system,
  which, however its parts may act on each other, is, and for
  ever remains, subject to no external influences.         And it
  passes in cycle through all phases which can be reached from
  its initial phase with E constant. I think we have no cage
  for such a bird.
      Nevertheless Rayleigh's reasoning, or Maxwell's pp. 553-
  554, must be accepted as proving that throughout the p:ith

                 Law of Partition of Energy..                  589'
of the imaginary system/ is constant. I think that /('//>) in
case cf a single system represents the time during which, on
an average of the cycle, it is in the phase (<]}>). If then E
be the only other constant, we should have/=<£(E), and that
would, as it seems to me at present, lead to the law of equal
partition.
   With great reluctance I am compelled, here to differ from
these high authorities. I think the method as a whole fails..
 Firstly because Maxwell's conditions are not fulfilled by any
existing systeim Secondly because, given Maxwell's con
dition alone, we have no right to assume E to be- the only
constant. Every system must, to go no further, have
constant parameters ; for instance (1) the masses mv m3, &c.,.
of its molecules, (2) their force constants fj.y /j.s, &c, if they
are centres of finite force, (3) their radii ct c3, &c, in the
limiting case of elastic spheres. These parameters should'
prima facie appear in /. Now m and /t do appear in E, and
therefore- in / as a function of E. But why may we assume
that they appear in that form only? And why may we
assume that in the limiting case of elastic spheres the c's do
not appear at all 2 These restrictions on the form of / are
indeed justified mathematically by Boltzmann's method,
if his fundamental assumption be true, and our habit of
accepting them as proved by Boltzmann predisposes us to
accept them when assumed in. a totally different case..
I think, however, they cannot be justified in any other way
than by Boltzmann's method. At all events Maxwell's
principle, taken, as we ace ordered, to take it, alone, seems
to me not to justify them-
                    Boltzmann's ^issumptiotu
   11. Boltzmann formally announces that he shall assume
that the matian of his molecules is, and for all time continues
to be " molecular ungeordnet." This expression is intended
to define some property which the system possesses. It
cannot be, and in fact is not, used as-a substantive assumption..
For any special case a separate- assumption has to be made,
which may be regarded as the interpretation of " molecular
ungeordnet" as applied to the special case in question.
   In the case of elastic spheres or binary encounters generally,
the thing assumed is as follows :—

whose velocities lie between the limits

We may call these spheres of the class F.
    Similarly fdudvdte is the number per unit of volume of
spheres of mass m, whose velocities lie. between the limits

                                «' +¦die
We may call these spheres of the class/.
    Boltzmann now assumes that the number of collisions
which take place per unit of volume and time between
spheres of class F and spheres of class /, and in which the
coordinates defining the relative position are within defined
limits da, is
                   F/ It dU dV dW du dr dw d<r,
               R»=(U-u)« + (V-r)2+(W-uO*.
That is, he assumes that the chance of a sphere M havimj
relocitie8 within the limits A is independent of the position and
¦of the velocities of the sphere m, horcevtr near the tico spheres
may he to one another. This we may call the condition of
 independence. Jt is assumed by necessary implication for
 all pairs of molecules approaching collision with each other.
    12. Having made or implied this assumption, Boltzniann
 from this point onward works rigorously. The truth of his
 result depends on the truth of the above assumption.
    By a collision of the kind last described the two spheres
 pass respectively into the classes F' and /', the numbers of
 which are FVU'rfVW and fdn'dv'dw. And by a process
*o well known that I need not here set it out, he deduces the
 H theorem. According to this theorem
     ~      W (Fy-F/)R log r%L
      at = ¦•_00                       j du dv dw dV dY dW,
 which is necessarily negative if not zero, and then only zero
when F'f' = ¥f for all cases in which a pair of spheres can
 pass by collision from the classes F/ to the classes Y'f or
 vice versd. And the solution of the equation Fy = F/
involves, if there be no stream-velocity,
whence we deduce
                          »«?=MtJa, &c.
    13. The result thus proved by Boltzmann, if his funda
 mental assumption is true, is that the motion is irreversible

                     Law of Partition of Energy.              591
and asymptotic. Maxwell and Rayleigh on the other hand
assume it to be cyclic and reversible. If, therefore, Boltz-
mann is right, Maxwell and Rayleigh are wrong. If
Maxwell and Rayleigh are right in their assumption, Boltz-
mann must be wrong—that is, his assumption must be
untrue, for the proof founded on it is irrefragable. This, I
think, is the true state of the case. But it will not make
Maxwell and Rayleigh right, either their assumption or the
proof founded on it.
   14. The law of equal partition in the form Mm'sMU* has
been proved by many writers in many ways. But with the
exception of Maxwell and Rayleigh, who (I think) fail to
prove the law at all, everyone bases his proof expressly or by
implication on the assumption of independence, as does
Boltzmann.          And all these proofs stand or fall with
Boltzmann's. No one has yet pointed out how the assump
tion of the molecular ungeordnet state can be directly used in
argument, or how it differs from the implied assumption of
independence.
   15. The assumption of the independence of the chances
(art. 11) is, as I maintain, untrue. A motion is surely con
ceivable in which molecules very near each other have on
average a certain velocity in common. I think this is a
necessary consequence of the existence of intermolecular
forces. It is probably true of a liquid. Why not in some
degree of a gas ? But Boltzmann by his fundamental
assumption excludes from consideration all cases of this kind.
He does not prove their non-existence, he takes it for granted.
   16. In order to express the possibility of such a motion,
we must represent the law of distribution of the velocities
«! V\ to, . . . if. of our molecules (at any given level of poten
tial if they be in a field of external force) by the exponential
e~k%.lux . . . du\. Here Q contains not squares of the
velocities «j r, . . . tr„ only, as in Boltzmann's theory, but is
a quadratic function comprising also products of the form
u\l, t't/, ww. The object ought to be to keep these products
in, not to keep them out.
   On the Law of Equal Partition if Boltzmann's assumption
                             be not made.
    17. I will now show what on this hypothesis becomes of
the law of equal partition of energy. I do this firstly to
obtain a more general result from which Boltzmann's can be
deduced as a particular case. Secondly, to show how little
we gain in ease of analysis by omitting the products from

 582                 Mr. S. H. Burbury on the
 Q, and so sacrificing the generality of the theorem.           1 will
 assume for this purpose that

          + (wij + mt)ftlt(M1ii1 + rji'j + u-j«»a) + Ac.

 Here w?,mj &c. denote the masses, ux vl wx &c. the component
 velocities of the molecules, and hn or bv is a function of the
 distance rM at the instant considered between the molecules
 mr and mq, which function is of negative sign, decreases in
 absolute magnitude as r increases, and becomes evanescent
 for values of r which rcmy themselves be small beyond the
 limits of observation. It is not necessary for the present
purpose to determine their form,
    lb. We first prove that

 Since Q contains no products of the form vv or ute, we need
not take the v's and w's into consideration in forming this
mean value. The result of the integration is as follows: Let
D denote the determinant
    D=
          (m1 + mi)bla         2mt          (wj+^j)^

   These are the equations which take the place of
and we have to consider the significance of these equations B
as bearing on the law of equal partition of energy.
   20. Now (I.) if we could prove that the ratios u£/mu*,
vnjmti*, &c. are the same for each molecule, we should have

established the law in the form mul = m'n'2. But theso
relations cannot be true generally, because the coefficients h
are functions of the diameters of the molecules if elastic
spheres, or of their radius of action if centres of force. The
law is therefore not generally true in the form >m**= »»'«'*.
    The following method suggests itself : —
    Since Q is constant we have
                 ^ /dQdu dQdv dQdw\ _ ~
                    \d7i'di     dvdt dwdt>~

If we can deduce — zcmu, &c, this together with A proves
the law of equal partition. I think, however, the deduction
 is unsound, for the reasons given above, and at p. 102 of my
" Treatise on the Kinetic Theory of Gases."
    II. By introducing the coefficients /< in the index Q we
 have given to any two molecules very near each other a
 common velocity on average, and so diminished the energy
 of the motion of any molecule ?/ij relative to its neighbours.
 If we prove that the amount by which the energy of this
 relative motion is diminished is £("ifi4 i'1t?1 -4- t£i£i), this
 expression would denote the energy of the stream. And now
 our equations (B) would express the law of equal partition
 in the only sense in which we could expect it to be true
 (see art. 2) —that is, as exclusive of the energy of the stream.
    But in fact i(Mifi+ t'l^i + wifi) does not express the loss
 of energy of the motion of mx relative to its neighbours, and
 therefore does not express the energy of the stream. To see
 this it is sufficient to consider the case in which all the
 molecules have the same mass. Then the energy of relative
 motion in question is for Wj
        W^-im, (u,-u')*+ fo-tO' + viCx-wT},
 where all molecules except /nj are included in the summation
 for u', v', w'.—That is,

                 — nijX. (««' + vtf + wu-') .
     If every h is zero the last term is zero. The loss of the
 energy of relative motion due to the h coefficients is therefore
                         m^, (mm' + vv + ww'),
-which is no longer zero when the i's are not zero.

   The mean value of this expression for r^i/j + tv'j + WiW>

is -.f -y!2, where D12 denotes the anaxial minor of D), and
contains terms in the first degree of the ft's.  But now
And if we form v^ut in tlie same way, the expression will
contain only second and higher powers of the Vs. It follows
that 2(»f + vt)+ irf) does nof; represent the stream energy.
And therefore the law of equal partition is not proved in the
sense above explained.
   If, however, as a mere question of definition, and "without
prejudice" to the facts, wo call 4("i£i + »'i»7i + tfi(Ti) the
energy of stream-motion for mu there is much to be said for
the definition. By so doing we should in a measure preserve
the symmetry, while unable to maintain the accuracy, of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann theory of equal partition of energy.
   21. I think the conclusions to be drawn are as follows : —
   I. The law of equal partition of energy among the trans
lation velocities is not proved by the Max well- Rayleigh
method.
   II. It is not proved by Boltzmann's method, because the
fundamental assumption on which that method is based is
not proved.
   III. Subject to any proof that may be given hereafter of
Boltzmann's assumption, which, however, I think can be
disproved, the law is not generally true in any sense
whatever.       When, however, the density is very small;
»m2 will differ from m'u" only by small quantities of the
second order.
   The law may therefore be asserted for the limiting case of
an infinitely rare gas.
  LVIII. The Rates of a Rocking Watch, with Remarks on a
            Gravitational Pendulum. By (J. BARU3 *.
(1)    A FTER mounting the works of an old watch in a
      J\. hard-wood ring, 1 noticed that the period of the
watch and case when suspended loosely from a pin a (after
wards, see fig. 4, replaced by a knife-edge), was almost
identical with that of the balance-wheel. As a result, the
watch when left to itself rocked permanently to and frt»^
the excursions amounting to as much as 9°, in later experi-
                   • Communicated by the Author.

596                   Prof. C. Barna on the
merits under proper adjustment * to over 18°. They wero
thus strikingly visible across a large room even without an
attached index. It occurred to me that such an arrangement
could be made to possess considerable didactic and possibly
practical interest, being not only a capital illustration of the
principle of resonance and of the principle of areas, but
lending itself at once to a more serious study of the inter
ference of two nearly synchronous vibrations with each other.
A very perfect system of two degrees of freedom undergoing
forced vibration is presented, for inspection : for the watch is
a recording instrument, and whatever period supervenes
under given conditions is found from, the dial in comparison
with a chronometer, also a recording instrument..
   With regard to the motion one may infer in a partial way
that the inertia of the balance-wheel wilL be apparently
increased or diminished according as the period of the watch
is above or below the normal period ot the former (about
£ second). While the balance-wheel, apart from friction, is
a simple harmonic pendulum fr-r all excursions, the watch is
not rigorously so, but shows a longer or shorter natural period,
depending on greater or smaller elongations within the limits
of observation. This is an. additional peculiarity giving further
scope to the instrument.
    On adding a suitable ballast at b (fig. 4), beats were natur
ally obtained often striking in character. But a singular
feature wras observed in these experiments i while beating
was marked at the outset, no adjustment was found which
made these beats permanent. They invariably vanished
gradually in the lapse of time, usually into the uniform
harmonic motion of smaller amplitude and period. These
and other circumstances induced me to follow the pheno
menon carefully, and in the following table I have recorded,
a selection of the results obtained hi so far as they deserve
notice.
    The watch was mounted on a steel knife-edge and swung
from hard steel plates (an old horseshoe-magnet). It was
removed once in 24 hours to be rewound, though sometimes
#6 hours were allowed to elapse. Comparisons were made-
with a good chronometer in the morning and evening to
seconds, this being much greater accuracy than the watch
.warranted..
    (2) Since the centre of gravity of the watch is approxi
 mately determinable by trial, and its period known, the moment
   * Much larger angles could have been obtained bad the adjustment
 permitted. Apart from this and friction &c. there is no near limit.

of inertia, k, of the watch without ballast is easily found from
its mass (65'87-i). In this way, roughly, £ = 681 g.cm.2
The increments of moment of inertia, 8k, were directly com
puted. They were produced by successively increasing small
metallic masses, all added at a distance of about 6 cm. below
the knife-edge.
   The table, which is an example of a single series of observa
tions, is otherwise clear. The rates are given in seconds per
hour of the chronometer (time in hours and fractions of an
hour) for each pair of consecutive observations, since this
method lends itself well for description in the annexed chart,
where curve I. shows the advance of the watch (ordinate) in
terms of the chronometer time (abscissa). The given saries
applies for an added ballast, increasing the inertia k about
3 per cent. The rates are inscribed on the successive
brandies of the curve. It will be seen that two typical rates,
respectively positive and negative, are involved.

Considerable fluctuation is observed in all the individual
r.ites, due to the imperfect watch, for they remain when the
watch is fixed. Sometimes definitely intermediate values
(as under Bk/k = 0) are in evidence, due to the spontaneous
change of the mode of vibration from the long to the short
period, the nature of which I will indicate below.

    Finally, if the successive rates be plotted in their dependence
 on the change of moment of inertia (Sk/k) due to the ballast t
 added, the curves fig. 3 will be obtained. Within the limits
 imposed by the errors of the watch and the errors of observa
 tion both are nearly straight lines, the values for the long
 period being much more clear-cut than those for the short
 period. These values are also given in Table II., from which
 it appears that numerically the rate for the long period
 increases 4"2 seconds per hour for each per cent, of relative
 increment (Sk/k) of the moment of inertia of the watch.
 The rate for the short period decreases on the average about
  •6 sec. /hour for each percen'. of Sk/k, within the greater part
 of the range observed. Here, however, the approach to a
 limit is definitely manifested.

    t I have expressed the rates in terms of the increments of moment of
 inertia for convenience. It should not be overlooked that ballast increases
 the gravitational torque.

 GOO                  Prof. C. Barus on the
 §§ 112-118. The inferences to he drawn when the system is
assimilated to the case of a single degree of freedom are
adduced in the third chapter. Inasmuch as I purpose merely
to present the above observations as an interesting illustration
of the general theory, having a possible practical application,
a few remarks will suffice for guidance.
   The present system of two degrees of freedom may vibrate
 permanently in one of two ways: either the balance-wheel
and the pendulum (watch) vibrate in the same phase, in
which ca«e the torque of the hair-spring is slowly paid out,
and there will be a long period and a long swing of the
pendulum ; or the two elements vibrate in opposed phases,
in which case torque is rapidly expended, the common period
is short, and the arc of vibration small. The long period may
usually be established from a sweeping swing of the pendulum,
while the short period is reached spontaneously from rest.
The adjustment is often difficult ; as a conssquence the two
periods occur in the curves in irregular succession, the
attempted predisposition having failed (cf. fig. 1). The two
compound periods found were invariably different. If the two
component periods are not equal, there can be no proportion
ality between corresponding terms in the Lagrangian function.
If they are equal this can take place only for one arc of
vibration of the pendulum. Beyond this the case is actua'lv
one of forced vibrations, and the energy of the system receives
a regular accession from the escapement.
   The treatment of the problem involves the consideration of
four frequencies ; the two belonging to the compouud free
system as observed above, and the two individual frequencies
of the component elements, the balance-wheel and the pendu
lum, when vibrating alone. I have already called these com
pound and component frequencies respectively. They must
be so grouped in relative magnitude that the two latter lie
within the limits of the two former, while an increase of
the inertia of the system (ballast) increases both periods.
   In the observations above the period of the pendulum
alone is successively increased, whereas the period of the
balance alone is left unchanged.      Hence the long period of
the system, which must exceed that of the watch, is suc
cessively pushed forward to infinity. The short period of
the system, remaining ever smaller than that of the balance
alone, is also increased gradually to reach the limit given by
the fixed period of the balance-wheel stated : i.e., the limit
corresponding to the normal rate of the watch at rest. In
the experiments, the occurrence of the two compound periods
and their variations is remarkably well shown, the compound

                      Rates of a Rocking Watch.                C01
   rates l>eing respectively increasingly slower and diminishingly
   faster than the chronometer. In fig. 3, the curve of long
   periods marches rapidly to — <», the other is asymptotic to
  a horizontal line at 5 sec/hour, the normal rate. The tendency
  of the positive rates to reach a limit on the right is home out
  by the observations. The remarkably linear character of the
  negative rates, however, is somewhat perplexing ; for if both
  curves be prolonged to the left, the negative rates should tend
  toward the asymptote + 5 sec/hour (watch at rest), while the
  positive rates with continually decreasing ballast should tend
  towards positive infinity. When the component period of
  the pendulum falls below that of the balance-wheel, both
 compound rates would soon be positive and the larger positive
  rates become the more variable. The appearance of the
  observation curves (fig. 3) is such as would lead one to
 suspect an intersection when Sk/k=— '15; i.e. when the
  inertia of the watch has been reduced 15 per cent. [ regret
 that the character of the mounting did not enable me to
 enter the negative field with the object of exhibiting the
 curves in full, in both directions.
     (4) In the case of the long period no beating was observed
 or producible. The component periods are increasingly
 different as Sk increases. The overwhelming inertia of the
 watch in this case completely controls the motion of the
 balance-wheel. To obtain beats the balance-wheel must be
 given an advantage by starting the pendulum as nearly as
 possible from rest.     In the case of the short period started
 with a moderate arc of vibration, beating is almost an
 invariable accompaniment of the incipient motion. As a
 first approximation the system may be compared with the
 case of a single degree of freedom, undergoing forced
 vibrations imposed by the escapement, eventually to respond
 permanently to the modified period of the balance-wheel.
 Meanwhile, however, the independent simple harmonic
 motion of the pendulum evoked on starting is vanishing
 exponentially. The observed beating is an interference of the
two sets of vibrations of nearly the same period. When the
pendulum vibrations proper have run their course beating
ceases.
    This explanation can only be partial, since it implies the
existence of but one compound period instead of two, and
since beats are particularly marked when the pendulum is
started from rest. They occur during the period of mutual
reaction, while the balance-wheel is stimulating the clock to
vibrate permanently in the smaller period, and they appear
as a hovering around the period of equilibrium which is very

 002                  • Prof. C. Barus &n the
 gradually established*. While the occurrence of beats in
 a system of two degrees of freedom presents no novelty,
 the evanescent character of the beating in the above
 apparatus is to be pointed out.        In order to make the two
 component periods more nearly the same, ballast would
 have to be removed from the watch. As I did not do this
 I cannot say whether beating in such a case would be more
 permanent.
     (5) The exceptional or intermediate periods are an average
 between the two free compound periods, and are produced
 when the system swings part of the- time between successive
 observations in one mode and part of the time in the other.
 At first I was inclined to regard this transition from one
 possible mode to the other as due to iiicident.il influences (air-
 currents, jar, temperature). It is probable, however, that
 the case is to be sought in the mechanism itself, and due to a
 change in the natural period of the balance-wheel according
 as the watch is more or less run down. Thus during an
 interval of 36 hours, the watch at rest changed its rate from
  + 5 sec/hour during the first 12 hours, to —4 sec/hour
 during the last 12 hours. (Conformably with this I noted
 that when the watch was allowed to run 3(1 hours without
 rewinding, the violently swinging long periods first observed
 were apt to fall oft' to the short periods of but slight motion
 during the last twelve hours. Again, on starting the watch
 for the long period immediately after winding, if the swing
is not quite wide enough, the short period eventually
 supervenes.       This observation is suggestive : the rate at
which energy is drained off by the resistances is in excess of
the rate at which energy is imparted to the rocking watch.
Like phases in the watch and the balance-wheel will not, in
general, be at once established, and hence the connecting
mechanism, as a rulfe, is ill adapted for effective transfer.
Unless the long period is approached from a longer period
(excessive swing of the pendulum), the former will thus be
out of reach and the vibration will fall oft' to the short
period.
    Furthermore, if the period of the balance-wheel increases
(as above) in the lapse of time, the corresponding long
period will also increase. Hence the watch is now put in
the same conditions observed when the watch is swung for
the long period from too short an arc. The short period is
eventually induced.
    (0) The above observations as a whole offer an interesting
   * An attempt to find the change of the period of these beats in the
lapse of time failed.

illustration of Lord Rayleigh's theory of anomalous
dispersion. In a system of two degrees of freedom the
reaction effect of the forced vibration on the exciting vibra
tion, is to shorten the period (increased rigidity) of tho
laiter, if its proper period is the* shorter, and to lengthen it
if its proper period is longer than the proper period of the
forced vibration. The reaction virtually increases or decreases
the elastic forces of the medium respectively, in the tivo
contrasted cases.
   Now let the balance-wheel represent a vibrating aether
particle, and the watch (pendulum) the vibrating absorption
molecule, the proper period of the latter being greater than
that of the former in the above experiments. Jf the balance-
wheel starts the pendulum from rest, the compound period is
shorter than either component period. Forces of restitution
are increased for both. In other words the violet end, or
the spectrum beginning at tho absorption-band, has moved to
tho red end beyond the absorption-band, becoming at the
same time more violet (periods generally decreased) . Again,
if the watch represents the aether particle and the wheel the
vibrating absorption molecule, the watch with a wide swing
starting the balance-wheel from rest, the compound period
is greater than either component period. Elastic forces are
both virtually diminished. In other words the red end, or
the spectrum terminating in the absorption-band, has moved
toward the violet end beyond the absorption-band and
l>ecome more deeply red (periods generally increased) . Had
the watch, been less imperfect it would be interesting, to
express this in detail, numerically.
   The question occurs, why are not these relations completely
reciprocal'? To return to the first analogy, in which the
balance-wheel (smaller proper period) represents the aether
particle, and the watch the absorption molecule ; if the latter
in violent vibration were to excite the sether particle, the long
period should appear. In other words, the spectrum on both
sides of the absorption-band will move toward the red in
colour, and toward the violet in regard to refraction. Both
causes conspire to increase the index. Conversely, if by
withdrawing ballast from the watch as above stated, its
proper period were reduced below that of the balance-wheel,
then, with the same terms of analogy, a compound period
shorter than either would appear.          This implies greater
frequency and less refraction, or marked decrease of tho
index of refraction of the medium.

an apparatus like the above rocking watch is adapted to

measure variations of the attraction of gravitation. Fig. .'?
shows at once that the short period of the above watch would
be unavailable for such a purpose, the changes of rate within
the range of observation being too small. The conditions
for the long period, however, are worth a statement. The
effect of adding ballast is an increment both of the moment
of inertia and of the torque acting on the compound pendulum.

of gravitation Bi//g, corresponding to the increments of

    These data show that the long period passes toward in
 finity at an accelerated rate with Bg/g ; for if the observations
 be grouped as suggested by the bracket*, the successive
 increments of rate are lls./h., 16 s./h., and 19 s./n., respec
 tively, for each per cent, of decrement of Bg'g. If the mean
 value be taken, the loss of a second per day on the rocking
 watch is equivalent to a decrement of gravitational accelera
 tion of 8<7/<7 = *00003. Even if one second per day is
  trustworthy on a good watch, this datum is about 200 times
  as large as the differential effect of a globe of lead 50 centim.
  in diameter, on the watch swinging immediately above and
  immediately below it.
     The case is somewhat more favourable when the variations
  of acceleration met with in a gravitational survey are in
  question. Quoting from the interesting digest of a survey
  across North America due to Prof. Mendenhall,* it appears
  that the surface variations encountered lie within an interval
  of lS/lO4, or 43 seconds per day on the above rocking watch ;
  while the variations reduced to sea- level lie within 32/105,
  about 11 seconds per day on the watch.

LIX. On some Cases of Propagation of Electric Oscillations
   along a dumber of Parallel Wires. Eg W. B. Morton,
   M.A., Professor of Natural Philusophg, Queen's College,
   Belfast*.
                        § 1. Introduction*
WHEN simple harmonic electromngnetic waves are
         guided along conducting wires of finite resistance, the
effect of the leads is to produce, first, a retardation of the
speed of propagation as compared with that in free space, and,
second, an attenuation of the amplitude of the waves as they
proceed. Both these effects are, in general, functions of the
frequency of the oscillations and of the constants of the con
ducting system. Their determination is what is mainly
wanted in the solution of the problem. The complete solution,
of course, involves in addition a knowledge of the distribution
of the electric and magnetic vectors inside and outside the
conductors.
   Let X be the wave-length, « the attenuation-factor, -- -
the frequency. Then, for waves travelling along the axis of
; in the positive direction, the different vectors contain the
factor

Replacing this by
                  eK'^—pt), where m= —            tVr
we see that a knowledge of the complex quantity m gives ira
at once the wave-length (and therefore the speed of propaga
tion) and the attenuation factor. The case of a single wire
surrounded by a sheath was worked out by Prof. J. J.
Thomson f; that of a single wire isolated in space has been
solved by SommerfeldJ.            In the latter case the return
 currents are carried by the dielectric ; lines of force which
start from a positive section of the surface of the wire bend
round and end on an adjoining negative section, forming in.
general very long loops.
    In experimental investigations on the subject the common
arrangement consists of two similar parallel wires. For slow
oscillations we have then Heaviside's well-known formula

    In the Annalen der Pliyxik for June of the present year,
G. Mie* has given a very complete solution of this problem
of propagation along two similar parallel wires. He finds an
expression for the wave-length and attenuation involving a
series of ascending powers «f the ratio of radius of wire to
distance of the wires apart, which is usually a small quantity.
He also determines completely the distribution of the electric
and magnetic vectors.
                 .§ 2. Scope of tlte present Note*
    Before this paper appeared I had been working at the
problem by a method of successive approximations. The
bulk of this work has been remlered nugatory by the publica
tion of Mie's much more satisfactory analysis, which gives a
single formula from which the solution can be got to any
xlesired degree of accuracy. The object of the present note
is to point out how the first approximation to the complete
solution may be very simply deduced from the known single-
wire solution. This approximation, as Mie has shown, means
that the square of the small quantity, radius of wire divided
by distance apart, is neglected. The advantage of this way
of arriving at the approximate solution lies in the fact that
the method admits of application to more complicated cases
where an exact solution is not possible. In fact we can
obtain an approximate equation for m in the general case of
any number of parallel wires of any sizes and materials, and
any arrangement in space, provided tliat all the radii are
small compared with all the relative distances. The different
roots of this equation correspond to the different ways of
grouping the wines into two opposite sets, snch «s might, per
haps be realized by connecting 'them indifferent wa3-s, each
wire to a separate secondary plate in a Lecher arrangement.
If we take corresponding point* on the wires we shall have
positive charges and currents on all the wires of one set,
negative on those of the other set. We shall use "similar"
and " opposite " to indicate wires belonging to the same or
different groups.

them © comes out a magnitude with a negligible imaginary

to employ this approximate solution, using 0 to mean a reaL

venient for purposes of discussion to distinguish two extreme
cases, viz., those in which La, the argument of the J functions^
is very large, and those in which it is very small. The
former condition is secured by low resistance and perme
ability, high frequency and large radius ; reversal of any of

         § 5. Application to the Ordinary Tuco-wire Case.
     Let us now take the case of two similar parallel wires each
 of radius a, at a distance apart b which is large compared
 with a. Suppose we try, as a first attempt at a solution, to
 superpose two single-wire solutions of the type given in the
last paragraph. The compounded vectors will, of course,
 satisfy the connecting equations for the dielectric. The
 difficulty arises when we come to the surface-conditions at
 the wires. But here we notice that of the three components
 specified in (4), there is one, the longitudinal electric force,
 which varies with log r ; the other two contain the factor
       The falling off in the values of the two I - J components
is much more rapid than for the (log r) component. Take for
example1             100 . The quantity
            I)..- =. yttt.-    M      J log  — is,' in actual cases,

roughly of order 10. At the surface of the second wire this
is reduced by log, 100 = 4*6. So that at the second wire the
longitudinal electric force due to the field of the first wire is
about half as great as the force due to the field of the second
 wire itself; whereas the radial electric force and the magnetic
 force only amount to one per cent, of the corresponding values.
In fact, to neglect at the surface of the second wire the radial
electric force due to the first, involves the same degree of
error as if we had the two wires statically charged with equal
and opposite charges, and neglected the smull variations from
uniform distribution on the wires, due to their mutual
influence.
    If now we agree to retain at the surface of the second
wire only the lengthwise component of the field of the first,
and further, if we neglect the variation of this component
trom one point to another over the surface of the wire, we
can arrange the ratio of the internal and external constants
 {d, D above) so as to satisfy the surface condition. We havo
then, instead of (4),

    It is clear that we can apply the same method to the most

of the wires are all large in comparison with their radii. We

   Examination shows that the small quantity has a positive
real part, therefore the modulus of D2 is smaller than that of
Di, or the larger wire carries less current and surface-charge
than the other.
   Looking at the matter from a more physical standpoint, we*

612     Prof. W. B. Morton on some Cases of Propagation
see that, while the greater number of lines of force, starting
from a positive section of one wire, find their way to the
surface of the other wire, there will be also, close to the points of
zero surface-charge, some re-entrant lines, witli their ends on
adjoining sections of the same wire. Our analysis shows that
the proportion of these latter lines is greater for the smaller
wire. It will help us to understand this result if we consider
that when the wires are isolated, as in Sommerfeld's case, the
scale is smaller when the radius of the wire is smaller. The
loops formed by the lines of force, now all re-entrant, are
shorter; and so, when a second wire is brought up, the pro
portion of these looped lines which lie close- enough to the wire
to preserve their arrangement undisturbed, is greater.
    I have worked out, numerically, the case of two copper
wires of the dimensions and conductivity taken by Sommerfeld
in his first case, and found the effect of making the radius of
one wire 1 per cent, greater than the other, their distance
apart being 100, 200, and 300 times the radius. The numerical
data are:—
      a = 0-2 cm.,   £- = 109,    1 = 5'83 x 10"*,      e= ~.

in a thousand. The imaginary part indicates a small phase-

    Therefore we have got the case in which the base wires
 are carrying equal and opposite currents, and the vertex wire
 is quite free from current. The equation for <? is the same
 as if there were no third wire. The remaining two roots of
 the cubic in i? correspond to the cases where the base wires
 are similar, and either opposite or similar to the vertex wire.
 The equation for these arrangements is intractable.
    We infer from the above that when two wires are con
 veying electric oscillations, a third wire equidistant from them
 plaj"s a passive part, it follows at once that if we have two
 pairs of wires at the corners of a rhombus there will be no
 mutual influence between the pairs. For example, telephone-
 messages sent along the pair at the ends of one diagonal of the
 rhombus will not be overheard along the other pair.
    When the triangle is equilateral we can have currents,
 whose algebraic sum is zero, divided among the wires in any
 manner.

    So that, if we neglect the slow variation of 8, the solution is
independent of h.
    To find a measure of the effect of the n leads tinder dis
cussion, we may compare them with a single wire of the same
material. For this we have by (8), a' being the radius, and
f the corresponding constant,
                     -<»log/-^C»)=2/'

    Therefore if the single wire is to produce the same effect
as the n wires, we must have
    Referring to (10), we see that when k^a is large this gives
                                  a'=na ;
when k-a is small,
                                  a'^na*.
    In other words, when the skin-effect is marked the n wires
produce the same effect on the waves as a single wire of n
times the perimeter .; but when the currents are not concen
trated on the surface, but occupy the whole section, the
n wires can be replaced by a single wire of n times the area.
This result was of course to be expected from general con
siderations. The siime approximate method of treatment
might be applied to equation (26) above.

The Scientific Papers of John Cocch Auams, M.A., Sc.D., D.C.L.+
   LL.B.. F.lt.S., late Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry
   in the University of Cambridge. Vol. II. (Cambridge : at the
   University Press, 1900.)
rPHE former volume of Prof. Adams's Scientific Papers was issued
 J- in 1896, and noticed in our vol. xliii. p. 71. It comprised
all those which were published by that distinguished astronomer
during his lifetime, from 1844, when he was 2'S years of age, to.
1890, which was two years before his death. But besides these,.
a large number of papers (as was remarked in our notice) on
different branches of astronomy were left in an incomplete state
amongst his manuscripts. 'Ihese have been prepared for publi
cation by Prof. Sainpsou, of the University of Durham, and form,,
together with abstracts of a number of lectures, the first part of
the volume now before us. The Preface describes the labour in
volved in the preparation of the manuscripts for press. They
consisted of an accumulation ot notes, studies, and rough work ;
and though, to use Prof. Sampson's words, " very few probably
have written their studies in a form so finished as Adams," and
though his manner of treating subjects of which he had the
absolute mastery seemed " to symbolize as well as to calculate the
motions of the stars," yet it was impossible to reproduce his own
words and order, and was necessary in fact to re-write the papers.
The most important are on numerical developments in the lunar
theory, the secular acceleration of the moon's mean motion, the
theory of Jupiter's satellites, the perturbation of the orbit of the
November meteors, and the figure of the e»rth. With regard to
the lectures, the editor followed the guidance of notes taken
by Mr. A. (iraharn of the Cambridge Observatory, by the late
Kev. A. Freeman (who at one time acted as deputy to Prof.
Challis, Airy's successor in the Phuuian chair), and by himself.
The first indeed, as here given, is substantially from Prof. Sampson's
own notes : it contains au historical sketch of the lunar theory,
which commenced with Newton. The others are on various points
in that theory, the original aim being to illustrate geometrically
the analytical processes, and thereby render them more compre
hensible : but others being added and several re-written, so that
the whole fabric was gradually changed into the form in which it
is here presented.
   The Second Part of the present volume is on the theory of
terrestrial magnetism, and is edited (like the first volume) by the
author's brother, Prof. W. Grylls Adams, of King's College,
London.      The work of the determination of the Gaussian
magnetic constants was first taken in hand fifty years ago, not
long after the discovery of the planet Neptune, and was suggested
by Gauss's pi. per, a translation of which was published in Taylor's
'Scientific Memoirs' in 1841; Gauss's own work having been
founded on the publication of Sabine's map of the total intensity

in the seventh Report of the British Association (i. e. that for
 1887). The need spoken of by Gauss for accurate determinations
of the magnetic declination, horizontal intensity, and dip, taken at
s rations uniformly distributed as in a network over the surface of
the earth, is eveu now very imperfectly supplied, particularly in
the southern hemisphere ; still much has been done in the last
fifty years, and we were glad lately to notice that observations of
that kind are being carried on by Dr. Doberck at Hongkong. Prof.
J. C. Adams's work here set forth forms an important and valuable
contribution to the progress of knowledge in this department :
and the tables contained in it, after being most carefully calculated
 by the assistants at the observatory, have also been rerified by
 some of those on the stuff of the ' Nautical Almanac' Altogether
 these two volumes will form an enduring monument to the memory
 of one scarcely known to the general public except as a discoverer
 of Neptune by the great achievement of calculating its path before
 it was actually seen, in which he had the priority.

   NEW RESEARCHES INTO POUILLET's PHENOMENON (THK HEAT
       DEVELOPED IN WETTING POWDEKS). BY TITO MARTINI.
 "I N this third memoir, published in the ' Proceedings of the Royal
 ¦*¦ Institute of Venice'*, I have demonstrated, by means of
 numerous experiments, that there are powders (thermometer-glass,
 quartz, calcium carbonate, &c.) which moisten well with water or
 other liquids, but which heat little or not at all however finely
 reduced. Other powders, like silica, the silicates, vegetable earth,
 artificial coals, undergo a great rise in temperature whether bathed
 in water, alcohol, ether, &c.
     With silica and animal charcoal I made new calorimetric mea
 sures, and obtained values larger than those recorded in my
 previous paper t, because I was careful to dry the powder well.
 The new values which represent the heat yielded to the calorimeter
 vary from 17 to 18'50 calories about, according to the degree
  of dryness of the powder.
     It is my opinion that a degree of heat so considerable is pro
  duced by the modification that the liquid undergoes when absorbed
  by the powder, by means of which modification the liquid is
  reduced to a condition of lower molecular energy. As a matter of
  fact, putting a determined weight of powder into a constant calori
  metric mass, 1 have been able to observe a diminution in the mass
  of the calorimeter, because the specific heat of a part of the water
  absorbed becomes equal to that of the ice. The demonstration of
  this interesting result is founded upon the following experiment.

   Let P be a weight of powder, silica or animal charcoal, not dry
but taken in its natural condition. Pouring this powder into the
calorimeter, Q calories are developed. Then let us dry an equal
weight of powder taken from the same source ; there will be found
a diminution of weight p, due to the water expelled. If we
multiply the weight p by the heat of fusion of ice, we shall obtain
a number of calories Q', which, added to the number Q, make a
sum equal to the number of calories that would be obtained by
pouring into the calorimeter a weight P of powder completely, or
almost, dry.
