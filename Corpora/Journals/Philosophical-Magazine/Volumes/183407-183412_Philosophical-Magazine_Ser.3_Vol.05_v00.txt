at a smaller distance than when two magnets attract each
other; but when soft iron is made to repel a magnet, by being
in contact with the corresponding pole of another magnet,
the law approximates to that of the simple inverse ratio, even
at very considerable distances; indeed, in this case the law of
the inverse ratio of the squares scarcely ever obtained at di
stances at which the magnetic action was very perceptible in
the method which I adopted to ascertain these forces; and
when they were brought near each other, the repulsive force
rapidly diminished, and ultimately became attractive. This
also occurred, although in a less degree, when the similar poles
of two magnets acted upon each other, if they materially, or
even moderately differed in intensity.
    The attraction under these circumstances at the commence
ment seemed to be in the duplicate inverse ratio, and on the
magnets being brought nearer together, in the simple inverse
ratio, of the distance.
    It may here be observed that the force of attraction was
considerably greater when the edges only of the magnets were
in contact, than when their whole surfaces were together,
which is perhaps attributable, in part at least, to the contact
being more complete in the former case than in the latter.
Hence it seems that the small magnets I employed lost one
half their force at the distance of about grºupth of an inch, one
quarter at Tºoth, &c.
    It is well known that pulverized magnetic iron, or iron
filings, will diverge at each pole of a magnet; and I found that
on making two dissimilar poles approach each other, this di
vergency was not changed till they were brought within
certain degrees of approximation, in fact, sufficiently near to
produce the change in the law above mentioned: the diver
gency then diminished, till the fibres of powdered loadstone
became parallel to each other, and to the axis of the attract
ing poles, and so they continued till the magnets were in ac
tual contact (see figs. 1. and 2.). This experiment seems to
afford distinct evidence of the change which the magnetic
elements sustain, and sufficiently explains the immediate
cause of the alteration in the law of the attractive force which
has been noticed.
    When similar poles are gradually made to approach each
other, the divergency of the adhering particles of loadstone is
sooner disturbed than in the case of attraction, it being more
and more increased, till the ferruginous filaments are repelled
at nearly right angles to the axis of the magnet; and if the
magnets differ much in force, the filaments attached to the
weaker one are so far driven back as to become nearly paral

poles reversed on the approach of the similar end of another
stronger magnet, seems calculated to throw light on the oppo
site electric relations acquired by two bodies when brought
into mutual contact; for, assuming that the electric elements,
like electrified bodies, possess opposite polarities both of at
traction and repulsion, is it not reasonable to believe that,
like the magnetic elements, those electric poles least tenaci
ously retained in one body, or most energetically opposed by
similar poles in another body, will turn from them, and even
be actually inverted, in order to adjust the balance of forces
between the positive and negative electricity in the two bodies?
This appeared to me to be a necessary consequence of mag
netic repulsion, and the attraction acting on the opposite ele
mentary poles, before I had ascertained the fact; and I think
that the same argument will apply with nearly equal force to
electric repulsion and attraction, and the cause of a very ob
scure phaenomenon may, in this way, be simply explained.
     Hence it seems to follow, that the direction of the elemen
tary poles may be sufficient to determine the positive or nega

matural   order of their affinities with respect to the atoms a   e,
im, and no, whilst the electric elements at 22, are reversed
with respect to e i and m n, the former atoms being made to
approximate, and the latter to recede from each other, even
tually giving rise to a semi-revolution of the atoms around
their common axes as shown by the arrows.
   The relative position of the different atoms in water and
                    I
other fluids must, think, have reference to their comparative
weight, or downward tendency.
   Fig. 6. may illustrate this idea, in which a series of atoms
of oxygen are placed under a similar series of atoms of hy
                            I
drogen; for they cannot, conceive, under any circumstances,
alternate horizontally with each other.
   It is possible that the state of fluidity may be due to an ex
cess of one of the electric polarities over the other, thereby
preventing the atoms from approaching within certain            di
stances of each other.
   Now, if we again refer to fig. 5. the directions of the arrows
exhibit a transfer of the hydrogen through the upper portion
of the circle, and the oxygen through the lower; because in
this case it is assumed that the decomposing surfaces are
bounded above, by the atoms of oxygen, and below, by those
of hydrogen. They cannot, however, in either case be readily
carried beyond one half of a revolution, because they would
then be respectively opposed by atoms similar to themselves;
but the electric elements, on their quitting the atoms, will not
be prevented by their polar affinities from completing their
revolutions, and returning to their previous direction in readi
ness to renew the operation with other atoms.                -
   The relative   positions which I have    supposed  the different
atoms in fluids to assume, may tend to impart a definite cha
racter to electrical action; and as it is not easy to imagine that
the electric elements will move with an equable velocity du
ring the whole of their revolution, if they are charged with
atoms of matter during the performance of one half of it only,
or that the time required to combine with, and to disengage
themselves from the atoms will be precisely the same, it seems
to follow as a probable consequence that voltaic electricity
may act on magnets by virtue of an excess of force or influ
ence in one direction over another.
   In the case of thermo-electricity, likewise, the time required
to disturb and restore the natural arrangements of the elec
tric elements may materially differ.
   On the hypothesis that the magnetic elements have their
opposite poles alternating with each other throughout the
curves which unite the two ends of a magnet, it is not difficult

to understand that if these curves are interrupted and broken,
and the magnetic elements coerced from their natural posi
tion by the approach of an electrical conductor, such a reci
procal action must occur between the magnet and conductor
as will cause them, if freely suspended, to assume some other
relative positions, the uniformity of which may be governed
by the arrangement of the magnetic elements with respect to
each other.          The
                      opposite poles of the latter may overlap
each other, for instance, in one uniform manner so as to de
termine them towards a tangential position with respect to the
axis of a magnet when acted upon by an electrical conductor:
the spiral form, and perhaps some other forms, might im
part to them this tendency. The same reasons may explain
why a magnet does not produce electricity in a metallic wire
 when moved in the direction of their common axes, as the
opposite poles of a magnet, in this case, have a tendency to
counteract each other’s influence.
    Many phaenomena in electro-magnetism seem to counten
ance the probability of a rotation of the electric elements, such
as the rotation of mercury, water, &c., when under the joint
influence of electricity and magnetism. There is also a me
 chanical fact, which                   I
                         published some time ago in the Journal
 of the Royal Institution, and which, perhaps, may be consi
 dered as favouring the opinion of the rotatory motion, or rather
tendency, even of common electricity, viz. that when a needle or
 any sharp-pointed instrument rapidly revolving round          own                                             its

 the card precisely similar    the effects produced  to    electric                                 by    an
 discharge”.   Moreover, the analogies afforded       the apparent                         by
 undulatory motion        light and sound, seem
                                        of              favour the                              to

II.    On the Falls of Niagara, with some Observations on the
    distinct Evidence which they bear to the Geological Character
    of the North American Plains. By G. FAIRholME, Esq.”
IT      has been well remarked by Captain Basil Hall, in the
     minute and luminous description which he has given us
of these celebrated falls, that the river on which they occur
is unlike any other stream with which we are at present ac
quainted.      It is at             its
                             full size from the first moment            ex                   of   its
istence; and although           contains more water than almost any
                                          it
other river,         the same distance from the sea,
                      at                                            larger      it     is    no
at  its mouth than         its commencement.
                                    at               Its course, too,                                   in

 turbulent    course,       has neither time nor

12               Mr.   Fairholme on the Falls                of Niagara
milar index to the length of time which has elapsed since the
first commencement of the present state of things on the sur
face, and consequently having so direct and simple a bearing
on the geological character of the district in which it is found.
    It is perhaps not so well known as it ought to be, that al
most the whole continent of North America consists of vast
plains, composed of secondary strata of various kinds; and
that calcareous formations in a horizontal stratification form
the leading characteristics in the geology of that country.
The prodigious lakes of Canada and the United States are
formed by the easy and gentle undulations of these secondary
strata; and the sea-like extent of these freshwater basins,
together with their generally low and swampy shores, exactly
correspond with the boundless extent of plain which sur
rounds them on every side. The very circumstance of the
rivers of North America being navigable for so great a propor
tion of their length, is sufficient to show the nature of the great
steppes through which they take their easy course towards
the ocean; and the rapids, which form so interesting and
  icturesque a feature in the inland navigation of the New
World, are obviously occasioned by those breaks and inter
ruptions in the superficial strata for which calcareous forma
tions are so remarkable.
    It is to one of these interruptions in the general level of
that part of the world that the cataract of Niagara owes                                        its
origin. Two vast plains,           steppes (as they are termed
                                         or                               the              in
North        Europe),
            of           extend themselves            different directions.

One    is spread over Upper Canada and New York towards the
north, while the other embraces the shores                             of
                                                            Lake Erie and
 itssurrounding States towards the south-west. Between these
great plains there          considerable difference
                            is
                             a                                level; andof                      as
 the former       lower than the
                 is                   latter,  all the waters which are
drained from the one must experience                fall, more

which they must pass, before they can subside into the ge
neral level of the other.

                                    Erie and Ontario, which are not

     This state       of

by the following section, in which the difference of level in
the two lakes is exhibited, although, of course, on a scale of
height altogether disproportioned to the extent of country over
which the declivity is spread. This fall of 1 foot in 160
would not be thought remarkable in any inland stream of
common size; but in the case of such a vast body of water as
the Niagara contains, (which forms a large proportion of the
whole fresh water of the earth, and has been calculated at one
hundred millions of tons per hour,) the action, when once set
in motion, must be enormous; nor can we feel surprise at the
powerful effects which it produces, and on which I am now
about to remark.

  The very trifling fall in the navigable parts of these 36 miles is not here
taken into account, but may be 2 or 3 feet of the above number.         They
extend from A to B, and from D to E, or Lake Ontario.
   But first, in order more clearly to illustrate the nature of
the country and the situation of the cataract,    shall quote a         I
short passage   from Captain Hall's interesting  account of                                     it,
which      is   itself perfectly clear, and has been corroborated
                  in
to   myself     by the oral testimony        my friend Sir Howard
                                                    of
Douglas, whose intimate acquaintance with the locality, and
whose acute discrimination               on
                                       all such subjects, no one will
dispute.

any natural event within the range of history.  The whole of
the upper lakes of North America, which more resemble seas
than inland collections of fresh water, will then be lowered
by nearly 300 feet, and the low countries between Lake On

infinitely more instructive, and shall therefore                 I                                  now resume
that view of the matter.
      No one who                   has examined and described the phaenomena
of Niagara has ever doubted that the section of the strata has
been effected by the sole action of the continued current; and
we have only to consider the nature of the existing causes
and effects, as exhibited at the cataract and below                                                        it,   to   be

about 100 feet; and this softer substance, being acted upon
by constant moisture and a violent current both of air and of
water, is rapidly decomposed, and gradually leaves the harder
beds overhanging their base to the amount of 50 or 60 feet.
This excavating effect produces that species of gallery into
which the more intrepid visitors can enter for about 150 feet,
and in front of which the appalling cataract tumbles like an
agitated curtain.    It is clear that this excavating effect cannot
be carried on    beyond    a certain point; for when the upper
strata are, at  length,   no longer able to sustain their mighty
load of waters,  the whole table rock must give way, and a                                           si
milar process be again renewed. By such incessant action,
the form of the cataract is constantly changing.         Many                                       in
stances have occurred of late      years;  and in 1828 a fragment
of rock gave way, and was carried into the abyss, which was
calculated at not less than 5000 cubic yards, producing re
peated shocks as of an earthquake, which were felt to a con
siderable distance in the surrounding country”.
   The receding of this remarkable waterfall being thus esta
blished, both by the evidence of facts and by the very nature
of the case itself, the question at once arises as to the length
of time required for executing the seven miles which have                                           al
ready been completed; and it is a self-evident fact, that how
ever long or short this period may be found to be, it must have
commenced at zero; or, in other words, the commencement

support of the Scripture statement; and last, though not
least, from the above phaenomena of the greatest of known
cataracts; and          I
                  shall look with some anxiety for a simple
and consistent refutation of the subject of this paper. In the
mean time      I
              must confess my own complete conviction of the
importance of these facts to the science of geology. We
everywhere hear of the immense periods, amounting to millions
of years, in which geologists seem to delight to revel. We
hear of a time when the mighty Mastodon and the gigantic
Mammoth, as well as other animals now supposed to be ex
tinct, lived and died upon the very spots in which we now
find their remains in a shattered and detached state; we find,
upon the same authorities, that the great plains of the Ame
rican continent must have been thickly peopled by these in
teresting animals; and we derive a sort of mysterious plea
sure in diving into the recesses of past times, and in pic
turing to the imagination the state of the present lands of the
earth at periods supposed to be far anterior to the creation of
the human, or of most of the existing animal, races. In the
midst of these pleasing day-dreams we are often disturbed by
the contradictory and stubborn facts which are from time to
time brought to light in opposition to them; and to crown
the whole, we find our magnificent ideas of the former state
of the American continent threatened with sudden and com
plete annihilation, by the evidence of Niagara against the very
eristence of the plains of that continent above the surface of the
ocean before the Mosaic Deluge.
    To such, however, as have viewed this important subject
in the light shed upon           with   it,

                          theoretical data, upon which the most
glaring, though opposing, facts appear, too often,                   have    to
little  or no influence. Such facts must, however, exert, sooner
 or  later,   anincreasing force, and must
                                                                        of to

of   the solid limestone         70 feet, the whole

    The traditions of the flood of Ogyges will not detain us
long.     Even his name, as a king of Attica, does not occur in
any extant author before the time of Alexander, and for most
of what we know of him we are indebted to the Christian
chronologers.      A passage in Eusebius, Praep. Evang. x. p. 10.
might lead us to conclude that the flood in his time had been
mentioned by Acusilaus, i.e. in the beginning of the 5th cen

28             The Rev. John Kenrick                    on the alleged
 cluded the idea of accidental coincidence, manifesting itself
 at a time when there could be no communication with a fo
 reign source. We have not found either of these conditions
 fulfilled in our inquiry into the traditions of Deucalion.
     The next hypothesis which suggests itself is that they are
 the real reminiscences of some local flood, such as a country
 abounding with lakes and mountains, bordered by the sea,
 and exposed to earthquakes, must often have undergone.                      It
 is certain that the Greeks had no tradition of a                general   de

the event, though within the laws of nature, were beyond
men's knowledge and experience of them, the more likely: it
was to happen, the more easy it was to suppose it happening,
to adorn it with circumstances, and to fix it to time and place.
The vulgar, too, draw much more liberally on extraordinary
causes to explain appearances, than a philosopher allows him
self to do.
     Ifwe are to receive the account of Deucalion's flood as the
tradition of a real occurrence, it will be difficult to say why
we should not do the same with regard to other Greek fables.
But of what real occurrence is the combustion of the world
by Phaethon, a tradition; or the submersion of the island
Atlantis; or the splitting of the continent Lyctonia into the
islands of the Mediterranean ** Although Sicily was to the
Greeks “the Threepointed Island+,” from the earliest time
in which it is named by them, and Scylla and Charybdis
                                                hº
appear in the voyage of Ulysses, must we suppose that there
was a real tradition of its          been a part of Italy, sepa
rated from it at Rhegiumf by an earthquake?
    We seem, therefore, to be brought to the third supposi
tion, that there is nothing historical in the flood of Deucalion,
and that all the circumstances which we find in Greek authors
respecting          it,
                previously    the time when they may have mix
                                           to

                                        foreigners, are fictitious.
 But fictions must have     determininga  cause, and those which
 relate    physical
           to       events generally  have this cause     physical                   in
appearances, popularly interpreted. Thessaly, the scene                                              of

from Scripture with the words flood, deluge, cataclysm, that we
transfer them       other ancient history, and suppose that they
imply events              of to
                  equal magnitude. But any overflowing                                          of   a

IV.       Remarks on the Atomic Constitution of Elastic Fluids.                                                 By
             WILLIAM CHARLEs HENRY, M.D., F.R.S.E
THE  following remarks, suggested by that portion of Dr.
  Prout’s Bridgewater Treatise which is devoted to the
 most comprehensive generalizations of chemical philosophy,
are proposed with considerable hesitation, from their not ac
 cording with the views of that profound writer. But it must
also be borne in mind, that the theory of atomic combina
tion adopted by Dr. Prout differs itself, most materially, from
that originally framed by the author of the atomic philosophy,
and still held by him, as well as by the majority of British che
mists. These differences, as far as they respect first principles,
may be comprehended in the two following propositions:
   1st, That equal volumes of                            all
                                          gaseous bodies contain,
under the same temperature and pressure, the same number
of self-repulsive molecules.
   2nd, “That the self-repulsive molecule,              exists    the             as   it                 in
gaseous form, does not represent the ultimate molecule, but                                                     is
composed          of
               many       them.”of
   1st, The idea that the particles                            of
                                                 gaseous fluids are  all
placed      at
            the same distances from one        another,  and conse

34             Dr. W. C. Henry's Remarks                              on the
conception without being aware that it had been previously
entertained by others.        These distinguished chemists do not,
however, concur with Ampère in regarding it in the light
merely of an hypothesis, but conceive that it is strictly deriv
able from the well-known law of Mariotte, and from the                                            si
milar relations of gaseous bodies to heat. They have there
fore made the first of the above propositions the basis of their
peculiar views on atomic combination, and have certainly suc
ceeded in proving that the second and more important pro
position flows from the first in direct logical sequence.             It is
therefore  necessary   to  examine,   with peculiar   care,   the grounds
upon which the major term is supposed to rest.
    The law of Mariotte, that in all elastic fluids the volumes
vary inversely as the compressing forces, will be found to
warrant no inference as to the number of atoms existing in
a given volume of the different gases.              It is derived from
the law of variation observed by the repulsive forces which
actuate the molecules of elastic fluids, not from the nume
 rical aggregation of atoms in space.            Newton has demon
 strated (Princ., Lib.                 II.
                                  Pr. xxiii.) “ that particles flying
 from each other with forces that are reciprocally propor
 tional to the distances of their centres, compose an elastic
 fluid whose density is as the compression.”             Now this is the
 law of Mariotte, which is hence independent of                   elements          all
 other than repulsive forces, varying inversely                the atomic          as
 distances     ordiameters. Whatever              the comparativebe                               di

                                             it   is
experiments,       will
                    as          be
                           shown hereafter, that equal increments
 ofabsolute heat         do
                       not produce equal dilatations      volume                    of             in
the different  gases,   and that this relation can only    correctly                    be
predicated     of
                equal increments   oftemperature.   Now there seems

                        Atomic Constitution                  of Elastic Fluids.                                  35
more reason to anticipate the existence of such a relation be
tween the number of molecules and the absolute or specific
heat, than between that number and the heat of temperature.
Upon this principle, since unequal increments of absolute heat
are required to effect equal expansions, we should conclude
that the numbers of atoms are also unequal.
                                                                                                                 of of all
    That equal increments of temperatures should affect
elastic fluids      the same degree,
                        in                     manifest consequence
                                                         is    a
the constitution         such fluids. The unequal expansibility

for heat.    Now it had long ago been suggested by Dr. Dalton
as the most probable view     of the relations of elastic fluids to
heat, that “the quantity of heat belonging to the ultimate
particles of                all
                elastic fluids must       the same under the same    be
pressure and temperature.”         Dulong and Petit have since
inferred from their experiments, that the specific heats         se                                               of
veral  simple bodies     the solid state,  when
                                           in   multiplied by  their
atomic weights, give       constant quantity    a  their product”.                          as
This relation has more recently     been shown         M. Neumann                                by
to  extend     several compound mineral substancest.

equal volumes are compared, and also that their ultimate
atoms possess the same amount              heat, M. Dumas's con      of
clusion, that equal volumes must contain the same number                                                               of

earlier results of Delaroche and Berard are still those most
deserving              of

38      Remarks on the Atomic Constitution       of Elastic Fluids.
 with the ultimate chemical atoms.          We have already had oc
 casion to refer to the      postulates employed      by Laplace as the
 basis of his profound mathematical inquiries into the consti
 tution of elastic fluids.       Now if heat be combined with the
 particles of matter by a principle of attraction or affinity (as
 supposed by Laplace), it is impossible to conceive such affinity
 to be exercised by aggregates of atoms, and yet not to be the
 attribute of the single atoms, of which such aggregates are
 composed. And if the ultimate atoms be endowed with an
 affinity for caloric, no reason can be assigned why union
 should not take place between caloric and each ultimate atom
 singly; nor, the molecules of heat being self-repulsive, why
 the ultimate atoms after such union should not become mu
 tually repulsive.      The contrary hypothesis of Dr. Prout              in
                             º:
 volves the anomaly of supposing heat to have a combining
 affinity for two or more atoms, while it is destitute of such af
 finity for single atoms; and also that of supposing two atoms
 to have relations towards two atoms, or three towards three,
 which do not obtain between single atoms.
     It is furthermore                        the question respecting
 the mode of union between heat and the molecules of bodies,
 is not limited to the constitution of elastic fluids, but must
 equally comprehend the conditions of liquid and of solid.
 Now the relations of several simple bodies to heat, established
 by the experiments of Dulong and Petit, point unequivocally
 to the chemical atoms, as determining the measure of specific
 heat.    In the thirteen simple substances which were the sub
jects of experiment, they found that the product of the spe
 cific heats into the atomic weights was invariably a constant
 quantity, and consequently that the ultimate atoms contained
 precisely the same quantity of caloric.            These results have
 been since confirmed by various German experimenters”, and
 can only be reconciled with the doctrine of the combination
 of heat with the ultimate chemical atom.
    In recapitulation, it has been shown,
     1st, That the law of Mariotte, and that of the equal expan
 sibility of the different gases, are mathematically derived from
elements altogether foreign to the numerical relations of their
 ultimate molecules; and that no corollary is contained in those
laws, determining equality of atoms in a given volume of the
different elastic fluids.

   2nd, That the most trustworthy experiments on the spe
cific heats of the gases, combined with the law of Dalton,
Dulong, and Neumann, lead to an opposite inference.
   3rd, That several examples of chemical combination are
inconsistent with the doctrine of numerical equalityof atoms
in equal spaces of the different gases.
   4th, That the original hypothesis of Dalton, which contem
plates the self-repulsive gaseous molecule as identical with the
ultimate chemical atom, has in                            its
                                    favour the greatest amount

the mineral to Berzelius for chemical examination; and soon
afterwards, in a paper inserted in the Transactions of the Royal
Swedish Academy for 1824+, Berzelius gave the following as
the constituents of the mineral:

   Berzelius accompanied his analysis with a statement that
he considered the mineral to be merely a chabasite.                 From a
subsequent explanation of Sir David Brewsterf, however, there
is every reason to believe that Berzelius had not distinguished
the levyne from some chabasite which accompanied it in the
same specimen, and that in reality a mixture of both minerals
had been subjected to analysis, a mistake which is not very
surprising, considering that levyne was at that time entirely a
new mineral, and                   its
                              aspect consequently little known.
    Had not reasonable doubt been thus thrown on the iden
                       a
tity        of
          the subject          Berzelius's analysis, any further exami

superfluous task; but under the circumstances,                      became                 it
 very desirable that          new  analysis

rise of temperature.     Silica was separated in the usual man
ner, and, after ignition, weighed 4.71 grains.     From the resi
dual liquid ammonia threw down alumina, which when ignited
weighed 24 grains.      By dissolving it in muriatic acid, and by
the subsequent action of caustic potash, and other necessary
steps, there were separated from it '03 of silica, '03 of oxide of
iron, and '03 of red oxide of manganese, equivalent to 027 of

westerly direction, and pursuing that course about 10 miles,
we see the coal-measures again emerging from beneath this
investiture around Over Arley in Shropshire. The western bor
der of this Dudley field, and the eastern border of correspond
ing Shropshire fields, ought to be carefully examined, as it seems
very probable that the strata may here extend continuously
within workable depth.
   Indications of Coal at the foot of the Bromsgrove Lickey.—
   These are so exceedingly shattered and disturbed as to
afford very little prospect of leading into any valuable working
districts.
   Coal-fields of Northern Staffordshire.--These, which follow
in order the patches near Ashborne, mentioned in my last,
consist of two detached fields, lying against the S.W. corner
of the great Derbyshire Penine chain: 1. the field of Cheadle,
ranging along the river Churnot, described by Farey as a
detached basin reposing on the millstone grit; and, 2. the
Pottery coal-field of Newcastle-under-Line, occupying a tri
angular area extending to Congleton on the north. From the
eastern and western sides the beds dip towards the centre;
but we are not informed in what manner they are disposed
along the southern base of the triangle by Newcastle: as they
are here overlaid by the new red sandstone, their prolonga
tions may very possibly be traced to some distance beneath              it.
 This portion requires reexamination.
   Great Manchester Coal-field.—This field, reposing against
the western slope        the Penine chain, ranges from Maccles
                           of
field to              of
                      Manchester, and then curving            the W.

portant field; but recent announcements promise that this
desideratum will           be
                        shortly supplied.     As this coal-field ap

beneath the new red        sandstone,   and   as  along   the western
border     ofthe almost contiguous aestuary    of  the Dee the coal

   North Welsh and Shropshire Coal-fields.—The memoirs of
Mr. Murchison promise to afford important additional in
formation concerning these districts.                      I
                                            have already in this
communication indicated their probable eastern extension, viz.
of the Flintshire coal-field to join that of Lancashire; and of
the Shropshire fields, near Bridgenorth and Over Arley, to
join that of Dudley. With regard to the north-western coal
fields, as we approach the Cumbrian mountains, or lake                               di
strict, that of Ingleton on the south of the carboniferous
limestone encircling this group appears to constitute a small
basin reposing on millstone grit, the shattered tract extending
hence eastwards to Giggleswick; and the immense faults
which traverse this district have been admirably described by
 Mr. Phillips (Geological Transactions, New Series, vol. ii.).
    On the northern border of the Cumbrian mountains, from
 Whitehaven on the western coast, to Ravensworth, where the
 Cumbrian and Penine chains inosculate, on the east, a regular
zone of coal-measures appears to succeed the carboniferous
limestone, and though the principal workings are at the two
extremities, indications have been found at various points be
tween these fields; hence we may hereafter look for a con
siderable extension beneath the new red sandstone of the Vale
of Eden.
   In my next communication I propose to conclude these re
marks by a similar notice of the south-western coal district.

     The last column gives the medium       between the mean day
of White's observations at      Selborne,   that of Markwick’s at
Catsfield, and that of Marsham's at Stratton, which may there
fore be taken with considerable accuracy for the regular date
of the appearance of the leaves of those trees in the southern
and eastern divisions of England, and, indeed, in England in
general, excepting, perhaps, its extreme northern parts.]
    On comparing the times of leafing of the same trees in
different years near Naples, it will easily be seen that this
period of vegetation varies according to the temperature which
has prevailed during the months of January, February, and
March. Thus, for example, in the year 1807, these three
months having continued very cold, the Elder opened             buds                              its
at the beginning     February; the Elm and the Filbert showed
                                 of
their leaves     the endat     the same month; the Birch, the
                                                     of
Beech, the Oak, and the Lime were not seen         leaf till towards               in
the middle     April.of  On the   contrary,     the year 1808, the            in
same months having been extremely mild, the frondescence
of  the same trees took place successively fifteen days earlier.
Finally,     1810, the thermometer
               in                         the beginning       March in                        of

                   15° Reaumur (or     nearly  66° Fahrenheit),                                            in
the course of the same month the leaf-buds of those trees
which usually open       April, were observed
                                           in        have fully ex                  to

fraud, so in philosophical investigation words of definite meaning
are indispensable securities against sophistry and self-delusion.

of those absurdities which from time to time attach themselves to
all other branches              of

emerge from, and plunge beneath, the sea. Extensive Provinces,
nay, entire Kingdoms, now perform the same feat.              The existence
of Craters of Elevation is by some still considered doubtful; but it
is an accredited fact that Mountains and Mountain Chains have
risen, either per saltum or per gradus.           All the Strata have been
raised; and all Unstratified Rocks would doubtless have been raised
also, but that some have risen of themselves. The Bed of the Sea
has been elevated again and again. Continents too have been raised,
though “by an operation distinct from that which raised the Pri
“mary Strata.”
   The arguments advanced in favour of these doctrines are derived
either from observation, or from induction.

account, and to another published in the Abeija Argentina, a work
of considerable reputation, which, by the kindness of Mr. Woodbine
Parish, I have been enabled to consult. The account there given of
the earthquake of 1822, is strongly recommended to the reader,
“as a sensible straight-forward description of what actually took
“ place, without the high colouring in which ignorance and terror
“ and exaggeration are apt to indulge.”
    No notice is here taken of the permanent Elevation of the Land,
and the account concludes thus:
   “The earth certainly cracked in places that were sandy or
“marshy; I saw cracks too in some of the hills, but mostly in
“the low nook where much earth had run together; the sea was
“ not much altered,—it retired a little, but came back to             old                                              its

                                             of paroxysmal violence, let
whether there may not                    be  going on, in the calmest seasons and in
the stillest countries, a                chronic and almost imperceptible impulsion of
land upwards.
   As early as the time                    of Swedenborg, who wrote in 1715, it was
observed that the level                    of the Baltic and German Ocean was on the
decline.      About the middle of the last century an animated and
long-continued discussion took place in Sweden, first as to the cause
of this phenomenon, and then as to                           by
                                                  reality. Hellant,        Tornea,                        of

who afterwards witnessed              himself, bequeathed
                                                  it                     had      the          all   he          to

                                             on
the investigation: the sum was small, but the bequest answered the
 purpose. Some                 of
                           the members          the Academy made marks
                                                                 of                                                   on

                                   in   bays,  recording    the day       which the                   on
 marks were      made,  and their then    height   above the water. The Baltic

              cannot but hope that similar investigations will also be
set on foot along the coasts    of France and Italy, and eventually be
extended to many of our colonial possessions.
    The inductive arguments in favour of the Elevation of land, what
ever the size, and whatever the amount of Rise, are founded chiefly
on the following circumstances: 1. The height of sedimentary beds
and marine bodies, whether corresponding or not to those of ad
jacent seas, or of the actual globe. 2. The height of terraces re
sembling sea beaches. 3. The height of ripple marks. 4. The
change of posture which horizontal strata undergo in the neigh
bourhood of “unstratified rocks.”      5. The various heights at which
 the same rocks occur in different parts of their course. 6. The an
 ticlinical posture of strata frequent in, though not confined to,
 mountain chains. 7. The arched or domed configuration of some
 strata. 8. The occurrence of coral, apparently recent, high above
 the present surface of the sea. 9. The position of ancient buildings,
 viz. the temple of Serapis at Puzzoli, &c. I have not time to con
 sider these arguments in detail; each deserves to form the subject
 of a separate treatise. Some of them prove not Elevation, but only
 change of level, which Subsidence would explain equally well. Some
 prove local disturbance, whereby one portion may have been thrown
 up, the other down. Some again afford a fair presumption of real
 local Elevation or Ascent. Most of them are good to a certain point:
 all are continually overstrained; and am frequently astonished       I                                        to
  observe how prodigious the weight, how slender the string that
  supports     it.

    If mines derive     their temperature from heat lodged in the centre of
the   earth, the   temperature    ought to vary with their distance from the
centre, and therefore, since the earth is an oblate spheroid, the mines
of Scandinavia ought at the same depth from the surface to be propor

   This Refrigeration, one of the most undoubted facts in geology, is
supposed by the Huttonians, and if I mistake not, by M. Elie de Beau
mont and others, to arise from a decrease of the Central Heat; an
opinion, however, which cannot, I think, be supported.
   We know of one method only by which Central Heat, if it exists, can
pass from the earth, viz. by Radiation. It cannot pass by Conduction.
Conduction implies conductors, which in empty space are not to be
procured *, but the Radiation of heat, at low temperatures, is so slight
that it is scarcely sensible at 100° of Fahrenheit's thermometer,
a temperature twice as great as the medium temperature of the sur
face of the globe at this time. The Temperature of the earth's surface
has been shown by Fourier to be as constant as are the dimensions
of   its
       orbit, and the period                    its
                                       annual revolution. Laplace observes,

not on celestial but terrestrial causes. The chapter that contains it
abounds in valuable information and ingenious reasoning; but when
the author tells us that * in every country “the land has been in some
“parts raised, in others depressed, by which and other ceaseless changes,
“ the configuration of the earth's surface has been remodelled again and
“ again since it was the habitation of organic beings, and the bed of the
“ ocean lifted up to the height of the highest mountains,”        cannot                 I
 but wish that he had stated this as an opinion, not as a fact.
    All these theories have one defect in common ; they do not meet
 the whole of the case. We have to explain not only the Cooling gra
dual during the long interval that occurred between the formation of
the carboniferous beds and the chalk, but also the Sudden Chill which
followed, and seems to have continued from that time to this. There
is yet another element to be taken into account.          The coal-beds of
 Melville Island contain various plants, natives of the country where
they are found, and which, if we may trust analogy, require for their
healthy growth or for their growth at all, not only tropical heat t,
but a tropical apportionment of the periods of exertion and repose.
It is a botanical impossibility that such plants could have flourished in
a region in which they must have been stimulated by months of con
 tinuous Light, and paralysed by months of uninterrupted Darkness.
The distribution of Light, therefore, as well as of Heat, must formerly
have been different from what it is at present.
    To meet this further difficulty, recourse is had to physical astro
nomy, which gives us the Precession of the Equinoxes, and a Shifting
Axis of Rotation : but the periodical changes of astronomers are insuf
 ficient to explain the phenomena to which I have just drawn your
attention. It has therefore been suggested that a greater change
may, in the course of ages, have been produced on the axis of the
 earth's rotation by some foreign cause, say the Collision of a Comet.
    Such change is undoubtedly possible, but of possibilities there is no
end, and we must circumscribe our researches to render them useful.
Sir John Herschel gives us no encouragement, therefore, to proceed
with this speculation. Mr. Conybeare also dissuades us from              but                  it,
 by   an argument which        to
                              me     at
                                    least appears inconclusive.
    His argument, founded upon the lunar theory,             this, that the  is
internal strata       the earth are ellipses parallel
                          of                                  external out

line, their centres being coincident, and their axes identical with that                            of
the surface. The present axis             of
                                      the earth must therefore have been
to its
     axis from the beginning.        may have been so, yet

rested on the facts which had then come before me. My acquaintance
with physical and geological nature is now extended; and that more
extended acquaintance would be entirely wasted upon me, if the
opinions which it will no longer allow me to retain, it did not also
induce me to rectify.   New data have flowed     and with the frank                  in,

    June 3.—A Paper was read entitled, “On certain Deviations from
 the ordinary Structure in Telopea speciocissima. By Mr. David Don,
 Libr. L.S.”
      a large proportion of the Proteaceae, Mr. Don observes, includ
        In
ing Telopea,  the filaments are firmly united along their whole length
to the inner surface of the foliola of the perianthium, which apparently
bearing the anthers in their concave apices, look as if they constituted
but a single series of organs, performing the double functions of sta
mina and perianthium. In a spike, however, of Telopea speciocissima,
 which blossomed at Mr. Knight's Nursery, in May 1833, Mr. Don
 found a number of flowers in which some of the filaments were en
 tirely free, and with the anthers more developed than are met with in
 the ordinary state; a circumstance which may have arisen from the
 oblique direction given to the stamen in a very early stage of the
 flower, (at which, in ordinary cases, the cohesion most probably takes
place,) and thus, in this instance, preventing cohesion from taking
 place between it and the opposite leaf of the perianthium.          The pis
tillum of this plant presents a beautiful example of adaptation. As the
leaves of the perianthium approximate closely at the base, –being
there so narrow as to have prevented the development of the ova
rium, had it been sessile, we find it elevated on a stalk, so as to place
it in the widest part of the tube formed by the 'eaves of the perianthium,
and, at the same time, to raise the stigma on a level with the anthers,
the ovarium appearing as if situated in the middle of the style. After
some further remarks on the structure of the pistillum, the author con
cludes by showing that the figure of Telopea speciocissima in “Exotic
Botany' is very faulty, the position of the flowers with respect to the
axis of the spike being entirely reversed.
    An addendum to Mr. Thompson's paper was also read, containing
a notice of two specimens         of the Noddy, Sterna stolida, Linn.,

 cavities on the surface of Ganymeda and the pits in them have very
 much the form of those figured by Dr. Goldfuss in his fossil, but I
 cannot regard them as being fitted for the attachment of spines:
 they have much more resemblance to the mouths of cells. So great,
 indeed, is this resemblance, that I entertained doubts whether the
 whole mass might not be a congeries of cells like the Lunulites,

 An Inaugural Lecture                         on the Study of Botany, read in the Library of
         the Botanic Garden                  of Oxford. By Charles Daubeny, M.D., F.R.S.,
         Professor of Chemistry and Botany in the University of Oxford.
         1834.
Th;          two Universities of this country have exhibited in succession
         what would elsewhere be considered an anomaly or abuse,_a
 professorial chair continuing to be held by an individual who gave no
 lectures.     That such a circumstance could be allowed, can only be
 accounted for by conceiving a general indifference to exist in regard
 to subjects on which these Professors had been appointed to lecture.
 That botany should be the branch of science and education so neg
  lected must seem strange to every one acquainted with what botany
 really and truly         while,  is,  respect      others, the neglect          easily                                     as

        RECENT DISCOVERY OF BONES OF THE IGUANODON.
     N interesting specimen of this fossil reptile                 has been lately
       discovered in the Shanklin sand formation, in the immediate
neighbourhood of Maidstone in Kent. The quarry in which these
remains occur consists of many strata, regularly alternating, of com
pact limestone, and of sand more or less loose.                Each stratum is of
 the thickness of from 8 inches to 12 or 14 ; and the alternation of
the two species of beds is remarkably regular and equal.
   It unfortunately happened that the blast by which these remains
were brought to light was inserted into what proved to be the centre
of this very deranged specimen, so that the whole mass containing it
was shattered into many pieces.             By the great care bestowed upon
them, however, by the very intelligent proprietor of the quarry, Mr.
W. H. Bensted, nearly               all
                                  the detached pieces have been collected,
and the various bones carefully cleared from the rock which forms their
matrix.    These remains, together with the other fossil bodies con
tained   in the same strata, cannot fail            prove        to
                                                                deep interest            of                             in

 on a smaller scale), as the vertical stems of large trees in the coal and
 other secondary   strata,  intersecting many distinct beds ; and this
 more than natural   rapidity  of deposition, which is not yet acknow

ON   SUBOXIDE OF LEAD AND PROTOxIDE OF TI N. BY M. BOUS
                              SINGAULT.
   By subjecting oxalate of lead to dry distillation, M. Dulong ob
tained a black powdery residue, which he considered as lead of a low
degree of oxidation.   M. Berzelius is of opinion that this new oxide
is produced  when metallic lead is exposed to the atmosphere. The
existence of this suboxide is not, however, admitted by      chemists,                                          all
and       its
          composition has not been determined.
   To determine the question M. Boussingault prepared suboxide                                                                  of

XIII.     Erperiments and Observations on the Action of Water
        and Air on Lead. By Captain PHILIP Yorke.*
1.      LTHOUGH the action of water on lead has at
         different times been noticed by chemical and other
             I
writers, yet venture to think that the experiments I have to
offer comprehend some new facts, and some which may assist
us in correcting views deduced   -
                                     from the results of previous
experimenters.
   2. My experiments originated in the examination of some
spring water which had flowed through somewhat more than
100 yards of leaden pipe. When this water, fresh drawn from
the cistern, was tested by a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, it gave a clear brown tint.   The quantity of oxide of lead
estimated   by the sulphuret obtained from 14% measured ounces
amounted to gain oth.      When it had stood two or three days
in an open vessel, it no longer gave the brown tint when
tested, but some white particles suspended in the liquid were
blackened.
   3. This circumstance called my attention to some results
obtained by Guyton de Morveau, quoted by Berzelius+, viz.
“ that oxide of lead is soluble in pure water, but insoluble in
water which contains the least trace of salt. If distilled water
is poured into a vessel of lead, and is left for some time, the
lead is attacked and the water acquires the property of exer

   4. As had not at this time seen these facts stated in any
other chemical work, I made the following experiments to
ascertain their exactness.      I put some distilled water into a
glass, loosely covered so as to keep out dust, and filled a
phial fitted with a ground-glass stopper with distilled water.
I  then arranged similar vessels with spring water, and into
each I put a slip of clean and fresh-cut lead. The spring water
used in this experiment                     I
                               had previously ascertained to con
tain in the gallon (of 10 pounds) 1:21 grain of the chlorides
of sodium and calcium, and 6'4 grains of carbonate of lime
held in solution by excess of carbonic acid (m3,7th).
    5. The spring water used in the above experiments with
lead was tested by sulphuretted hydrogen after the lapse of
three days, three weeks, and a year respectively, but never
gave any indication of holding lead in solution. The lead ac
quired         its
            usual dull surface      last, and became invested near
                                                  at
the surface of the water with oxide of reddish and brownish a

    much resembled some brilliant varieties of mica: under the
    microscope by transmitted light they were yellowish.
       7. Such are the general appearances presented by the action
    of water on lead. To ascertain whether any effect was produced
    when access of air was entirely cut off, I filled a little retort
    with distilled water, and boiled it for some time; I then intro
    duced into it some fresh-cut clear slips of lead. The beak of
    the retort, which was quite full of water, was then immersed
    in a basin of mercury, the surface of which was covered with
    water. When this arrangement was examined after standing
    three weeks, not the smallest bubble of gas was visible. The
    lead was still bright, though a little whitish in places: the
    water struck a very pale brown when tested by sulphuretted
    hydrogen.     The retort was then left open and half-filled for
    a night; a quantity of the white substance formed, and the
    water gave a deep brown when tested.       It is evident from this
    experiment that the lead does not derive oxygen from the
    water, but from the air contained in                      it,
                                              though, like iron                                  in   si

and the combination immersed in a phial       of distilled water as
before. The next day, the white crystalline substance had
formed on the lead, and some rust on the head of the nail:
the point in contact with the lead remained bright many days.
Another nail, placed in a similar phial of distilled water, for the
sake of comparison, was covered by brown hydrated oxide in
three days.     When the first arrangement was examined after
standing seven months, the nail next the lead was still partly
bright: the head was covered with rust, mixed with which the
grey laminar crystals of oxide of lead and the little dodeca
hedral crystals were scattered over the surface both of the
lead and the iron. The water when tested by sulphuretted
hydrogen gave a deep brown tint.
     13. A slip of lead, which had the ordinary dull surface
which the metal acquires by exposure to the atmosphere, was
immersed in a phial of distilled water which had been agitated
with air, as in the previous experiments: the water was tested
at the end of a week by sulphuretted hydrogen, but gave no
 indication of holding any lead in solution.

     14. Before  I consider the nature of this substance,.I should
 observe, that when I made my first experiments on the sub
ject, I was not acquainted with the researches of Dr. Christi
 son, contained in his Treatise on Poisons, p. 458 et seq.,
 2nd edit., but from my own (5.), I did not doubt that De
 Morveau was right in concluding that the substance in ques
 tion was a hydrate. Dr. Christison, however, maintains as
 the result of his experiments that both the white crystals,
 whose external character he describes much as         I have done,
 and the lead held in solution by the distilled water, are in
 the state of carbonate.     Most, then, of the experiments that
 follow were made with the knowledge of Dr. Christison's pre
  vious researches, and some with the particular object of deter
  mining between G. de Morveau's and my own first opinions
  on the one hand, and Dr. Christison's results on the other.
     15. The substances were obtained as related (8.); the white
  substance collected and dried in vacuo with sulphuric acid:
  when dry it effervesced very slightly with a dilute acid. A por
  tion weighing 2.67 grains was introduced into a bent tube of
  green glass closed at one end; the open end of this was fitted in
  to another tube, both being provided with corks and previously
  counterpoised: the substance was then heated red in the re
  tort tube, and some water condensed in the receiver tube; the
  tubes were then corked, and weighed when cold: the retort

  86       Capt. P. Yorke's Experiments and Observations
  tube had lost 28 grain; the water in the receiver weighed '06
  grain only.
     16. In another experiment, an open test tube, containing a
  solution of caustic potash, was placed in the bottle with the
  lead and water. The white substance in question which form
  ed was dried in vacuo as before. A quantity, equal to 1688
  grain, was introduced into a green glass tube about 34
                                                                  inches
  long (a), into which was fitted, by grinding, the little tube (b),
  open at both ends, filled with chloride of calcium,
                                                                and the
  end of the tube (c), which was adapted to the end of tube
  (a) by a collar of caoutchouc, introduced under          a jar full of
  mercury. The tube (a) was then heated: a quantity of gas
                                                                        was
  given off, equal 42 cubic inch, of which 16 cubic
                                                              inch was
  absorbed by caustic potash.        The tube (b) had gained '05
  grain; the tube (a) weighed when cold, had lost 158 grain.
  Yellow oxide remained.
     17. In another experiment with the same apparatus 1-314
  grain gave off a portion of gas which was absorbed by potash,
  but from an accident the quantity was not estimated.                 The
  chloride of calcium gained '036 grain, and the tube (a) lost
  *154 grain.
     18. If the whole loss sustained minus the quantity of water
  collected be reckoned as carbonic acid, we have as the result
  of the last two experiments:

  20. When a portion of this substance was put into a stop
ped phial with distilled water, and the water tested after some
days by sulphuretted hydrogen, it gave a barely perceptible
brown tint.
   When some of the substance slightly moistened was ex
posed freely to the air two or three hours, it dissolved in acids
with brisk effervescence, like common carbonate of lead.

   21. In order to show the power the aqueous solution of
oxide of lead possesses of reddening turmeric paper, it is suffi
cient to put a single slip of fresh-cut lead into a phial of             di
stilled water which has been agitated with air, and introduce
with it a bit of turmeric paper: in two or three hours the pa
per will be permanently reddened.
    22. The liquid obtained by experiment 8, and others                  si
milarly conducted, has the following properties: 1. it reddens
turmeric paper easily, and restores the blue of reddened litmus
paper; 2. it gives a deep brown colour with a solution of sul
phuretted hydrogen, and soon deposits a black precipitate;
3. it becomes immediately very turbid on the addition of di
lute sulphuric acid; 4. also with a solution of carbonic acid;
5. turbid with a solution of sulphate of soda,-the effect much
increased by a drop of sulphuric acid; 6. an equal effect with
bisulphate of potash.        With a drop of a solution of iodide of
 potassium, it gave a white cloud, which on the addition of a
 drop of very dilute muriatic acid became orange-yellow, and
 deposited a yellow precipitate of iodide of lead.       With a so
 lution of common salt it immediately becomes turbid; also
 the same with the solution of sulphate of lime, containing
           of that salt; slightly turbid with a solution of nitre.
 rºw.  With neutral chromate of ammonia      it preserved          its
                                                               trans

                                                     acetic acid was
 added,      deposited  a a
                          yellow precipitate.
          it

  88       Capt. P. Yorke's Experiments and Observations
      When agitated in a half-filled phial it becomes turbid. The
  same effect occurs when it is boiled in a glass flask.            When
  left  freely exposed   to the   air  without     the  contact of lead, it
  deposits the whole, or nearly the whole, of the oxide in the
  form of the white substance before described.
     23. Becquerel has shown that when solutions of lead or
  manganese are decomposed          by the voltaic battery, the con
  ducting wires being of     platina,   the peroxides of those metals
  are separated at the positive pole”.          I find this to be the case
  with lead, whether the acetate, the nitrate, or a solution of
 the oxide in lime water be employed. When the aqueous
 solution of oxide of lead was thus decomposed, the conducting
 wires being terminated by slips of platina foil, that at the
 negative pole was slightly blackened by metallic lead, that at
 the positive acquired a fine bronze yellow, and the edge of
 a bit of litmus paper in contact with the foil was bleached.
     24. In my first attempts to ascertain the quantity of oxide
 of lead which was held in solution by distilled water, the             li
 quid obtained, as is described (8.), was filtered; but the            fil
 tered liquid was turbid, and when obtained clear by refiltering
 it was found on testing it that it no longer contained any lead
 in solution. This was repeated on a portion of liquid from
 another bottle, which previously to filtering gave a deep brown
 with sulphuretted hydrogen, with the same effect.
    25. To obtain the quantity of oxide of lead dissolved by the
 water, the rods of lead were carefully removed from the bottle,
 the stopper replaced, and the liquid, when clear, drawn off by
 a siphon.
     1st trial; 3000 grains of such a solution evaporated with a
       drop of nitric acid, converted into a sulphate, and thus
       ignited, weighed 33 grain = 242 oxide.
    2nd, 3000 grains evaporated with a drop of nitric acid in
       a flask; the evaporation terminated, and oxide ignited in a
       platina crucible; the oxide obtained weighed 245 grain.
    3rd, 5000 grains of the solution was divided into two equal
       parts: one part was reserved for a subsequent experiment;
       the other, evaporated as in the last, gave 244 grain of
       oxide. In the first two trials the quantity of oxide dis
       solved is about Takunth, in the third Tºrn.
    26. It is very possible, however, that pure water is really
capable of holding a greater quantity of oxide of lead in so
lution than has been here obtained; for it is difficult, if not
impossible, to disturb these solutions without occasioning the
deposition of part of the oxide in the form of a white powder,

e.gr. the removing the rods of lead from the bottle is suffi
cient.     I cannot       say from  experiment whether this effect is
determined by the contact of the carbonic acid in the atmo
sphere, and that the substance deposited is identical with
the white crystalline body already described, or from some
other cause, but am more inclined to think it should be re
ferred to the agitation of the liquid, which causes crystalliza
tion to take place in a nearly saturated solution.

    27.  I have before said that Dr. Christison has stated,               the                 as
results    of his experiments, that the lead dissolved              water           by             is
in   the state      of
                    carbonate.       But the    following   experiments,                           I

and with sulphuretted hydrogen a decided brown, but not
equal in tint to that produced by distilled water which had
been three or four days in contact with lead.
   Some of the same carbonate was put into a phial with the
solution of carbonic acid and another portion of the carbonate
into another phial with distilled water. When the liquids were
tested after standing two days, the carbonic acid solution gave
a brown colour, the distilled water a very pale tint.
   33. To ascertain the degree of solubility of carbonate of
lead in the solution of carbonic acid, a solution of carbonate
of lead was formed by putting a quantity of carbonate of lead,
obtained as before stated, into the solution of carbonic acid in
distilled water. After standing some days the clear liquid was
drawn off for experiment (2).
   Another solution was obtained by washing some good ce
ruse on a filter, until the filtered liquid, when tested by sul
phuretted hydrogen, gave no further diminution of tint. By
continued effusions of distilled water, the solution of carbonic
acid was then filtered through the washed carbonate, and the
liquid preserved for use (3).
   34. A standard solution of lead was then made by dis
solving one grain of pure oxide of lead in acetic acid, and eva
porating this to dryness at the heat of boiling water, and dis
solving the resulting acetate in 1000 grains of distilled water.
   35. When a portion of the standard solution was diluted
with about 83 parts of distilled water, the tint produced on
testing this by sulphuretted hydrogen and the solution in car
 bonic acid (2), was equal. When the standard solution was
diluted with between 50 and 60 parts of distilled water, the
tint produced on testing it and the solution (3) was equal.
    36. Thus it appears that such a solution of carbonic acid as
I  used is capable of holding in solution about from Fºrsth
 to grºwth of oxide of lead if presented to it in the state
of carbonate. These solutions immediately become turbid
when carbonate or bicarbonate of potash is added; but, with
    (a)  least,

metals, particularly iron, partly because it appeared that ef
fects that have been described might be modified by the con
tact of other metals, and partly because the tables of the elec
tric order of metals given by different philosophers differ from
each other in the place assigned to lead. Thus in Dr. Henry's
Elements we have first Sir H. Davy's table of metals, the
liquid conductor being acid or saline solutions, and it runs
thus—zinc, iron, tin, lead, copper, each being positive to
those that follow : some pages further in the same work we
find Volta's arrangement”, which runs thus—zinc, lead, tin,
iron, copper. This also accords with Pouillet's table.
    40. My experiments were made with a galvanometer havin
 two needles and a glass thread, as constructed by Dr. Ritchie.
 The plates of the metals were 2 inches long by 14 wide, and
 retained at equal distances by fixing a slip of wood a quarter
 of an inch thick between them. Copper wires were soldered
 to the plates to connect them with the cups of the galvano
 meter.     The liquids were contained in cylindrical earthen
 ware   cups  holding about 4 ounces of water.
   I  found that when the liquids employed were either distilled
 water, spring water, solutions of neutral salts, dilute sulphuric,
 muriatic or nitric acids, lime-water, or solution of caustic
 potash, and the metals both bright, that lead was to iron
 constantly as the zinc to copper in the common voltaic ar
 rangements, or that the current was from the lead to the iron
 through the liquid.    But when the lead was tarnished before
 it was put into the water, or when, being put into acids or
 saline solutions, it was suffered to remain immersed a short
 time, the deflection of the needle rapidly diminished, and
 after a time took place in the opposite direction.
     In the Bakerian Lecture for 1826, Sir H. Davy has given an
 example, and pointed out the general cause, of such reversals
 in the relations of metals; but the particular case of lead is not
 there noticed, and it occupies the same relative place in an
 amended table of the order of metals given in that memoir
 which it originally held in the series published by the same
 philosopher in the Journal of the Royal Institution published
  in 1802.
     41. The power of deflecting the needle as measured by the
 torsion of glass threads given by plates of lead and iron, com
 pared with that given by similar combinations of zinc and
  copper with the same liquids, is shown approximately in the

  It is      otherwisemanifest, that provided the fixed points on
which the    system    rests be capable of supplying resistance in
every possible direction,      this parallelism is necessary to the
condition of a minimum amount of resistance.
   When, however, the resistances of the system are supplied
by the contact of surfaces capable of motion upon one another,
this condition of resistance in every possible direction is not
satisfied; the possible directions of resistance at each point

     From the comparison                          of   these observations, every one                          will

               of the Climate of Naples upon the Periods of Vegetation.                  107
           be able to reckon that the same plants flower in Naples two
           months and a half (or ten weeks) earlier than at Upsal, and
           a month (or four weeks) earlier than at Paris.
                The considerations before explained respecting the                       in
           fluence of the difference of the seasons in accelerating or in
           retarding the periods of vegetation, ought in every way to be
           applied to the time of flowering.                In like manner, as in the
           period of leafing, we may, however, observe that the efflo
           rescence of plants varies from 15 to 20 days, according to the
           changes in the temperature of the different years.
                 Now, before we estimate the times of blowing at Naples
           with those of the same plants in England, it will be necessary
           first to reduce each of the dates before given to a more cer
           tain medium day between an early and a late year, by taking
            18 days as the mean varying time, which, for the purpose of
           showing the variations in the different Neapolitan seasons, and
           of being compared with those in the English seasons given in
           the catalogue at page 105, I have computed in the following
           IIlanner :

               Therefore, from a calculation of the mean dates given in
           the last two comparative Tables, there results this general
           difference in the times of flowering in those countries, that is
           to say, the efflorescence of the same species of plants occurs

108    Mr. J. Hogg      and Sig. Tenore on the comparative Influence
sooner at Naples by above seven weeks, at Paris from two to
three weeks earlier, and at Upsal by about five weeks later,
than it is wont to do in England.
    But in computing more exactly the times of this cycle of
vegetation, little reliance only can be placed on the notices
with regard to Upsal and Paris, for Linnaeus seems to have
made his observations in one single year, and d’Audibert has
fixed no precise days of the given months; and moreover they
have both neglected to state the number of days which vary
in the blossoming of these plants, according to the tempera
ture of the weather in early or late years. On the contrary,
the dates given by White and Markwick are the earliest and
latest times of flowering for a great many years; and the mean
of these having been calculated, will establish as accurately as
possible the true date for the return of this period of vegeta
tion in England in every ordinary season.]
                               IV.   Fructescence.
    At the time in which the fruits spontaneously fall, or are
easily plucked, off the mother plant, begins that period of ve
getation which we distinguish by the name of fructescence
 (fructescentia); to this we may apply the same observations
 that have been made in the preceding articles upon the varia
 tions which the influence of the climates, of the seasons, and
 of the atmosphere exerts upon the different periods of vege
 tation. Therefore with us (at Naples) the ripeness of fruits
 is about 20 days earlier or later, according as the spring and
 summer have been hotter and more rainy, or drier and more
 temperate.
    Linnaeus has observed that barley and wheat ripen on the
 4th of August at Upsal. Near Naples these sorts of corn are
 reaped in June in Terra di Lavoro and in Puglia; and in
 July in Abruzzo.
    [Owing to the proportionably greater heat that is prevalent
in the summer in Sweden, and to the more speedy vegetation
 than in England, the wheat harvest will be found from the
 annexed view not to be any earlier with us than at Upsal,
 but to begin at the same time; and- barley to ripen ten days
later with us than in Sweden.

June, whilst at Naples they are eaten from the first week in
 Mav.

between the periods of vegetation in those parts of the world.

          ponderable Bodies, and Caloric and Electricity.                        111
with, bodies, as measured by their power of imparting or abs
tracting heat, is exactly proportional to the quantity of any
ponderable (simple), substance separable from, or combining
with, the same bodies, as ascertained by weighing.             Thus it
requires, according to the law of Dulong and Petit, twice as
much caloric to elevate the temperature of a pound of sulphur
10 degrees, as it does to raise that of a pound of zinc to
the same extent; and a pound of heated sulphur will warm
twice as much water, or any third substance, as a pound of
equally hot zinc. Now this is exactly what takes place among
ponderable substances. A certain weight of sulphur combines
with twice as much oxygen, or chlorine, as the same weight
of zinc does, in forming the correspondent compound and
gives up twice as much on entering into a fresh combination.
If   we were to adapt to the ponderable body oxygen, the
phraseology which we are accustomed to use in regard to ca
loric, we might say then, and the fact would be correct, how
ever unusual the expression, that the “capacity” of sulphur
for oxygen is twice as great as that of zinc.           Again, “the
quantities of oxygen combined with by sulphur and zinc are
in inverse ratio to the weights of the atoms of those bodies.”
    Again, a given quantity of oxygen will raise, in the scale of
oxides, portions of zinc and of sulphur represented by their
atomic weights. Once more, “the weights of oxygen in the
corresponding oxides, multiplied by the atomic weights, give
a constant quantity.”      For 16 parts of sulphur combine with
 8 oxygen, 16 zinc with 4 oxygen, but 8 x 16 = 4 x 32. This
ground of analogy between caloric and ponderable bodies is
 so obvious, that it would seem as if it must have occurred to
 many, yet I have never seen it adverted to...                If
                                                         it has really
 escaped some who might have been expected to notice                 the   it,
 difference  in our modes      of
                               expressing facts thus closely corre
 sponding, when the subject       caloric and when
                                    is                         ponder

 able body, furnishes one reason for the oversight.           Another
is  found    the circumstance that
            in                           our experiments and re
                                         in

 ports of experiments       the relation     bodies           to
 custom ourselves    to equal quantities     the bodies compared,
 and variable quantities   of caloric.
    We are accustomed, on the other hand,               take  to  fixed    a
 quantity   ofany ponderable substance, and         variable
                                                         a     quantity

galvanic action by certain weights of particular bodies, is pre
cisely the same with that which is required to separate them
from their combination with other particles when subject to
electrolytic action.    He describes one experiment in parti
cular, in which “the chemical action of about 32 parts of
zinc, arranged as a voltaic battery, was able to evolve a cur
rent of electricity capable of decomposing and transferring
the elements of 9 grains of water".” Here we may remark the
difference in expression, while the fact stated is the same.                                 If
for electricity we say iodine, the quantity “set free,” or
“ called into action,” during the decomposition of an atom of
iodide of zinc, is precisely the same which is required “for
forming a new compound on the decomposition of an atom of
water.”      I
             am aware that the once prevalent doctrine of the
materiality of caloric and electricity has given way before the
conclusions deduced from certain optical phaenomena; but if
the being subject to similar laws of combination with material
bodies has no weight in restoring them to a place among
forms of matter, it may still assist us in investigating others of
their relations.

petioles, which are divided into a prodigious number of rami
fications mutually embracing and intersecting one another,
and forming a fabric similar to a piece of fine network.               The
principal fibre, extending from the base to the apex of the leaf,
forms what is called the midrib; the lateral ramifications form
what are called the nerves or veins; terms borrowed from the
animal kingdom, but calculated to mislead as having no func
tions in common with the nerves or veins of animals. Yet
many leaves have no transverse fibres. In monocotyledonous
plants the fibres are parallel to the midrib.                But the most
singular circumstance in the structure of the leaf                      not                  is,

of an epidermis, containing a hollow cylinder of pulp, thickly
set with bundles of longitudinal fibres disposed in a circu
lar row, and lined with a soft and spongy pith, which is                                          it
self tubular, and lined with a fine and transparent mem
brane, consisting of a most intricate plexus of soft and de
licate fibres, forming an ultimate cavity, which is sometimes
partly filled up with a fine and cottony down, or with fine
and transverse diaphragms resembling cobwebs.
     It should be added that the tubular stem does not neces
sarily form one single and continued cylinder, except in the
 Agarics, but rather a succession of individual cylinders united
to one another by joints, or knots, that form transverse dia
phragms interrupting the continuity of the tube, even though
it is furnished with no pith, as in the grasses.                But though
 the trunk of this order of plants is often tubular, yet the root
is not often tubular,        though the root of Water-Hemlock fur
nishes an     exception,--but      is wholly filled up with pulp and
 interspersed fibre, or with      layers  similar to those of the orders

dle of longitudinal fibres united into one cord, like the fila
ments that compose the nerves of animals, and which termi
nate ultimately in soft, bibulous, and club-shaped appendages
designated by the appellation of spongiolae.
    Thus we trace in plants the foundation of three grand orders,
 depending upon the relative simplicity or complexity of the
 structure of the caudex, and presumed to exhaust the subject.
 They agree in point of number, but not in point of specific
 extent, with the arrangements of modern botanists, by which
plants are reduced to three grand orders depending upon the
structure of their seeds—the acotyledonous, the monocoty
ledonous, and the dicotyledonous.          Whether or not these
groupings of threes give any support to Professor Burnett's
system of triads,    Iam not able to say; but what we learn,

absence of all indications of that mechanical violence which

                                                  to            what       con     of             I

proofs,) that there exist         the limestone district
                                     in                          Derbyshire           of
three distinct beds           of
                           toadstone.      The limestone occupying the
surface, and lying above the first                highest toadstone—that
                                                               or
between the first and second toadstones—that between the
second and third—and that beneath the third—he has termed
respectively the first, second, third, and fourth limestones. He
states that these beds               of
                                 toadstone have continuous bassets,
that  of the third       lowest bed commencing
                         or                                  the north near   on
Castleton, and ranging                by
                                  Wormhill, Chalmerton, Pike Hall,
and the Grange          Bonsal Dale; and those
                        to                                   the two other    of

     Stratification        of the       Limestone        District      of Derbyshire.        123
 beds ranging nearly parallel to the above basset at short                                   di
 stances to the west of it.
   Let us first consider the two latter bassets, i. e. those of his
first and second toadstones.    He asserts that they commence
on the north at the  great fault (which he assumes to run N.
 and S. between Castleton and Litton,) not far from Wind
 mill Houses, the first passing near the village of Litton and
 the second near Tideswell.          Now of the existence of a toad
 stone basset     anywhere     to the north of Litton, where these
 are said to   commence,               I
                                 have not been able to find the most
 remote indication, either in my own examination of the spot,
 or in the information I have derived from the most intelligent
 miners in the neighbourhood; and moreover                   can myself         I
 bear positive testimony to the fact that the toadstone near
 Tideswell, which Farey asserts to belong to the second bed,
 belongs to the same as that at Litton, which he has assigned
 to the first, for I have most distinctly traced the toadstone
 without the smallest interruption from the one place to the
 other. It is manifestly brought up by the E. and W. fault
 which has elevated Litton Edge.
    Again,        (if
                    understand him rightly, which
                     I                                    sometimes       is                   no
 easy matter, even with the aid              his able commentator *,)
                                                      of
 Farey says, that the first basset passes nearly           the southern    at
extremity            of
                  Crossbrook Dale, and from thence             Fin Copt         to
 Hill; and that the second passes from near Tideswell the                             to
southern extremity          Tideswell Dale next the Wye, ranging

 “ the crooked straight, and the rough places plain.”
    But to proceed with Farey's imaginary bassets. The first
 basset passes, he says, from Crossbrook Dale to Fin Copt Hill.
 I assert  in answer, that there is no continuous basset between
 those points, nor can                        I
                             find the slightest evidence of any

   It   would be useless for me to dwell upon other points in
 which Farey has fallen into errors exactly similar to those                                                 I
 have already pointed out, and from the same cause—a total
 neglect of the great distinction between a partial and a com
 plete basset.                                         I
                    Those of which have more particularly spoken
 in the   vicinity  of the Wye are manifestly of the former,                                                in
 stead of being, as he has represented them, of the latter class;
 and hence we have the important conclusion that the basset
 immediately to the west of them, from Copt Hill to Chilmerton,
 must belong to the same and highest bed, instead of being the
 third, as Farey has represented.                                I
                                              have no doubt too of this
 basset    being    only  a  partial   one,  terminating     shortly after
 crossing the Ashborne and Buxton road, to the south of Chil
 merton.       Hence, again, I conclude that the limestone west of
 this line of basset is the first limestone, instead of being the
jourth, according to Farey's notions.            The toadstone ranging
 N. and S. between Dove Hole and the Wye, about two miles
 E. of Buxton, must, again, be the highest, and the limestone on
 the surface at this western boundary of the district must have
 been of contemporaneous formation with that on the eastern
 side, and passes            (in
                          this north-western portion         the boundary             of

 which ranges, according              his account, along this western

jourth limestone occupying the surface, must necessarily                                                    be

 128        Mr. Hopkins's               Remarks on Farey's Account                        of the
 dence and obvious appearances in that part of the boundary
 to which      I
            have more particularly referred.
    That a great N. and S. fault, however, does exist,   have                                  I
 no doubt, though inferior in importance and very different in
 position to that which Farey imagined.          It is this fault which
 has brought to the surface the toadstone basset already men
 tioned as extending from Copt Hill to the south of Chilmer
 ton, and has produced that central elevated ridge which
 forms the principal feature in the external character of the
 district.                       I
             Of this believe that I shall be able on some future
 occasion to offer the most indisputable evidence.          Farey's ac
 count of the great E. and W. fault at the southern extremity
 of the limestone agrees with my own observations as far as
 they have yet extended, which is not far west of Hopton; but
 whether any N. and S. fault meets this further westward
 I  have not yet ascertained.      At the northern extremity of the
 district, instead of a fault ranging along the whole extreme
 boundary, an E. and W. one ranges from the north side of Copt
 Hill, where it meets the great N. and S. fault, to Castleton.
 That described by Farey as extending from Castleton nearly
 to Litton,          is,
                     believe, totally unsupported
                      I                                   the slightest           by

Jirst, second, and third toadstones, must necessarily have been

 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
         Gentlemen,
    N     reply to Dr. C. Henry, I take the opportunity of stating,
       once for all, that I have neither time nor inclination to en
ter into a controversy on any opinions advanced in my Bridg
water Treatise. That these opinions would provoke discussion
I    expected, and, indeed, rather wished, as such discussion
would be likely to lead to the truth—my great and only ob
ject.       Hypotheses and theories                         I
                                             care nothing about, further
 than they are true; and whoever can convince me that any
 hypothesis which I have published is not true, will be esteemed
 a friend.                                                               -
      It is now     nearly  twenty    years   since a   paper    containing
 views virtually founded on the hypothesis attacked by Dr.
 Henry was published by me in your Journal+; and from
 that time to the present I have seen no reason to doubt                                                           its
 truth.       With respect       the facts stated by Dr. Henry, most
                                         to

    Tourmaline, and other Minerals, when exposed to Heat. By

    Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh".
                  the phaenomena of the pyro-electricity of
ALTHOUGH
   minerals, as it has been termed, and those of the tourma
line in particular, have, after a long period of neglect, been
recently studied by more than one philosopher of eminence,
there is a sufficient number of undetermined or debatable
points, even at the threshold of the inquiry, to yield facts of
novelty and interest to those who will take the trouble to look
for them.
    Having during the past summer been much engaged in
studying the relations of bodies to heat and electricity, I was
induced, by having in my possession a considerable number
of long tourmalines, to repeat and endeavour to verify some
recently published experiments with this mineral.     These          in
quiries brought out several new facts; and, with the hope
of adding something to our knowledge in this curious field,
I  have taken this opportunity of communicating to the Society
the results of some very recent experiments.
    My attention was principally directed to the verification
and extension of the views of M. Becquerel, whose ingenious
papers published in the Annales de Chimie for 1828, give us
almost the only information, with the exception of a short
paper by Dr. Brewster published in 1824, which we have
gained on this subject since the appearance of the works of
 Haüy. The undecided state in which several points of the
 first importance were left by the philosophers of the last cen
 tury is not a little remarkable.    In fact, the answer to the

   “The publication  ofthis paper was delayed partly under the idea      of

   M. Becquerel, in a second memoir on the Tourmaline,
published in 1828", announced the rather extraordinary cir
cumstance, that long tourmalines did not become at                 electric                        all
 by  heat, and that their facility                    of
                                           being excited was generally
inversely proportional           their length. Dr. Thomson,

work on Heath, mentions the former assertion, and observes

                                                  M. Becquerel was six

of  about '08 inch.      My largest tourmaline           3:25 inches,            is                               or
almost precisely the same, with            diameter little different.

was accustomed to use towards those of smaller dimensions.
The intensity too was very great, though more slowly attained
than  in  shorter ones.      Various tourmalines, between two and
three inches        length, uniformly show great activity
                      in                                             being                              on

   April 8–A     Letter was read, addressed to the Secretary by John
Hearne, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z. S., dated Port au Prince, Feb. 15, 1834.
It accompanied a present to the Society of a pair of the common Goats
of Hayti; referred to various Birds which it is the intention of the
writer to forward when the season is more advanced; and gave some
particulars of a bird known in the island by the name of the Musicien,
respecting which Mr. Hearne hopes to obtain, in the course of a jour
ney which he projects into the higher lands of the interior, more full
information than he at present possesses.
   Some extracts were read from a Letter, addressed to Mr. Yarrell
by Dr. A. Smith, Corr. Memb. Z. S., dated Cape Town, Jan. 12,
1834. It refers to the projected expedition from the Cape of Good
Hope into the interior of Africa, which it is the intention of the writer
to accompany. It is designed to proceed directly northward from
Latakoo; and Dr. Smith anticipates in this new field numerous ad
ditions to his Zoological stores: along the eastern and western coasts
he has already penetrated to a considerable distance.       Speaking of
the Rodentia, so numerous in Southern Africa, he mentions as col
lected by him, in his late visit to Port Natal and the Zoola country,
a second species of his genus Dendromys.         He also notices a new
species of Chrysochloris obtained by him in the same country.
   At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Gould exhibited an exten
sive series of Birds of the genus Trogon, Linn., comprising twenty
five species.   The greater number of them form part of the Society's
 Museum, and the others were derived from his own collection.
    He pointed out the distinguishing marks of the two sections of
the genus, one of which is confined to America, while the other
inhabits the Old Continent.      He also pointed out among the species
exhibited there which he    regarded  as hitherto undescribed; these he
named and characterized as      TRogoN     erythrocephalus, Malabaricus,
and elegans.
  Mr. Bennett briefly recapitulated the facts and reasonings which
have from time to time been brought before the Society on the                   sub
ject of the abdominal glands of the Monotremata, regarded by Meckel
 and by Mr. Owen as mammary, and by M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire
as connected with a peculiar function, to which, however, differ
ent results have been attributed by that learned zoologist at various
times". The object of the recapitulation was to introduce an abstract
of a recent Memoir by M. Geoffroy-Saint-Hilaire, “On the structure
and use of the Monotrematic glands, and particularly on those glands

in the Cetacea.”     In this Memoir the author regards the mammary
glands of the Cetacea, so analogous in structure to those of Ornitho
rhynchus and Echidna, as having a function similar to that which he has
attributed to these latter: he assumes that the fluid secreted by them
is not milk but mucus, and that this mucus is not sucked by the
young, (whose organs of deglutition he describes as being unfitted
for sucking,) but is ejected by the mother into the water, the element
in which they dwell, where, by imbibition of a portion of the water,
it becomes thickened, and, floating by the mother's side, is devoured
by the progeny.
    M. Geoffroy has subsequently changed his opinion as to the na
ture of the fluid secreted by the nutrient glands of the Cetacea.             He
had had an opportunity of examining these glands in some Porpoises,
and had found the secretion to be actually milk.             He still, however,
maintains that the young of the Cetacea do not suck, but that the
mother ejects the nutritious fluid from the milk receptacle into the
mouth of her young.
   April 22.—Some Notes by J. B. Harvey, Esq., Corr. Memb. Z. S.,
were read: they accompanied a collection of Shells and Crustacea
made by the writer on the coast of Devonshire, near Teignmouth.
The several specimens were exhibited.
   Among them were numerous individuals of Cypraea Pediculus, Cyp.
bullata, and Cyp. Arctica.       Of the former there are two varieties,
one  spotted   and the other without spots.         The spotted variety, Mr.
Harvey states, is generally smaller than the plain one, and is less pro
duced on one side near the aper.
   Cyp. bullata is found in the same localities as Cyp. Pediculus, but
it may   be doubted whether it is the young of that species: it is so
comparatively rare, that Mr. Harvey has dredged up only six speci
mens of      it,
              while          he
                        has collected more than        hundred      aCyp. Pedi         of

perhaps, live deeply imbedded                   in

are very vivid; and among these green, blue, and blueish grey are
the most predominant.       Adhering to the Caryophyllia is occasionally
found the Pyrgoma Anglicum, Leach, which appears to occur in no
other situation.
    At the request of the Chairman, Mr. Thompson of Belfast exhi
bited an immature specimen of the long-tailed Manis, Manis tetra
dactyla, Linn., for the purpose of showing that when very young,
 (the present specimen being but ten inches in length,) the animal is
as thoroughly armed, both with respect to scales and spines, as the full
grown one. The specimen was also considered by Mr. Thompson as
 interesting on account of        locality,        its
                                               having been obtained     it                                             in

   Mr. Owen     read a Paper   “On the Structure of the Heart of the
Perennibranchiate Amphibia, or Reptiles douteuw of Cuvier.”
   He briefly noticed the progressive discoveries relating to the heart
of Reptiles which have been made since the time of Linnaeus, and
which have successively rendered inapplicable to the Saurians, Cheloni
ans, and Ophidians, the phrase “Cor uniloculare, uniauritum”, applied
to the whole of the Reptilia in the ‘Systema Naturae'.      He alluded to
the researches of Dr. Davy and M. Martin St. Ange on the structure
of the heart in the Caducibranchiate Amphibia, from which it appeared
that two auricles were appended to the ventricle in those Reptiles, as
well as in the higher orders above mentioned.       He then proceeded to
give the results of an examination of the hearts of specimens of Am
  hiuma, Cuv., Menopoma, Harlan, Proteus, Schreib., and Siren, Linn.
He selected the heart of the Siren lacertina as the subject of detailed
description, considering that the genus Siren, in combining with per
sistent external branchia a limited number of extremities, exhibits the
simplest form of the Amphibious Reptile.
   The heart in this species consists of three distinct cavities, as in the
higher Reptilia, viz. of two auricles and one ventricle. The auricles
appear to form externally one large and remarkably fimbriated cavity,
situated behind, and advancing forwards, on both sides of the ventricle
and bulbus arteriosus.     The venous blood is poured into a large mem
branous sinus     by  one posterior and two anterior vende cavae prior
to passing  into the auricle. The conjoined trunk of the pulmonary
veins  appears   also to enter this sinus, but it passes through without
communicating with that cavity, and terminates in a small separate
auricle, which opens into the ventricle by an orifice distinct from, but
close to, the orifice of the right auricle. In the ventricle a rudimen
tary septum was noticed as affording an indication of a type of forma
tion superior to that of Fishes. In the bulbus arteriosus a longitudinal
projection appears as a commencing division of the single artery,
which is given off from the ventricle.
   The differences in the structure of the preceding parts, and in the
origin and distribution of the different vessels exhibited by the other
genera of Perennibranchiata, were successively noticed; and the affini
ties indicated by these modifications to the Caducibranchiate Reptiles
on the one hand, and to the Cartilaginous Fishes on the other, were
also pointed out.

ON SOME NEW       COMBINATIONS OF PLATINA. BY M. DOEBERE IN ER.
   F solutions of muriate of platina and carbonate of soda, the latter
    being in excess, be               exposed for some days to the sun,
or a temperature of 212°, there is gradually formed a precipitate, of
a chrome yellow colour, which is partly in small crystals, composed
of soda and oxide of platina, in proportions not yet ascertained: these
contain from 0.5 to 1 per cent. of chlorine.         I consider this pre
cipitate as a salt, which I shall call provisionally platinale of soda,

quantity of water, then acid, and becomes black: the soda which
it contains may then be separated by water. The black powder

 of the acid undergo a more complete decomposition, for towards
  the end, the products are coloured and empyreumatic, and there re
  main in the retort a mixture of lime and carbonates and a small
  quantity of charcoal, which renders them black: 40 parts of mar
  garic acid, treated in this manner, yielded 28 parts of a slightly
  yellowish solid, which soiled paper when pressed, and yielded 22
  parts of dry matter, which melted at 165°Fahrenheit.                  It was re
  peatedly treated with alcohol of sp. gr. 0.837. After 11 digestions
  the fusing point of the last portion dissolved was 171°.
     The substance thus obtained is of a pure white, brilliant and
  pearly when withdrawn from the alcohol from which it is precipi
  tated.    It fuses, as already mentioned, at 171°; crystallizes irregu
 larly on cooling; and in appearance resembles margaric acid, or
  spermaceti.       It is a nonconductor of electricity, and becomes
 strongly electrical by friction or pressure: when triturated in an
 agate mortar it often rises to the edges of the mortar, or to the
 pestle, and adheres to the paper used in removing                          heated         it.   If  it   be

it seemed at first to be insoluble : the solution was alkaline, and
was not precipitated by ammonia.           It has the characteristic pro
perty of becoming turbid when it is heated to about 160°Fahr. and
depositing a great quantity of a white precipitate, which gradually
redissolves as the solution cools.       It is owing to the formation of
this salt in the mixture of solutions of sulphate of magnesia and
borax, that a precipitate is occasioned when it is heated. This
precipitation is occasioned by the formation and precipitation of
sub-borate of magnesia, while borate of soda and boracic acid
remain in solution.     On evaporating the liquor separated by filtra
tion from the    precipitate,  boracic acid evaporates with the water,
and a saline mass is       obtained,  from which alcohol separates a
quantity of boracic acid.       This sub-borate of magnesia is most
readily obtained by heating a mixture of solution of borax and sul
phate of magnesia.
   Hydrate or carbonate of magnesia dissolves in a hot solution of
boracic acid. The solution is alkaline: by evaporation it deposits
a salt in crystalline grains, which is very soluble in water, although
the solution goes on slowly. The solution is not precipitated at a
high temperature, but when mixed with a solution of borax, it
deposits a white precipitate if heated to about 160°.          The preci
pitate disappears at common temperatures.
   This borate of magnesia when heated to redness loses much
water and boracic acid. The residue has the appearance of pumice
stone: water dissolves much pure boracic acid from               and pure                         it,
magnesia remains.         appears, then, that      high temperatures the

esteem    him much. I studied at Brunswick under Knoch, and here
at  Göttingen   under Blumenbach.    Already in 1803, and therefore
earlier than Mohs, I became a mineralogical writer, building my
system on peculiar views belonging to no other school.     I was the
first who appeared as opponent to Werner; assisted in the spreading
of Häuy's theory; and published my first mineralogical system
in 1809, founded on chemical composition and external characters.
I  gave in 1813 a complete Handbuch on Mineralogy. Later                                               I
treated Crystallography on a method of my own, totally different
from that of Mohs, though he was publishing at the same time; and
in 1821        I
             completed my method in a quarto volume of 677 pages,
entitled, “Examinations on the Forms of Lifeless Nature;’ and next,
in the first volume of my new edition of Mineralogy, in 1828, which
work I had the honour to present to the London Geological Society.
Had Mr. W. looked into this book, he might have convinced him
self of his erroneous assertion; and as it is not indifferent to me
how England judges of me, I should be greatly obliged if through
your Journal his statement could be rectified.         HAUSMANN.”

&c., or more cautiously, that it determines their evolution
upon the surface; and that the negative pole acts in an equal
manner         upon      hydrogen,            combustibles,              metals,       and bases.
According to my view, the determining force is not at the
poles, but within the decomposing body; and the oxygen and
acids are rendered at the negative extremity of that body,
whilst hydrogen, metals, &c., are evolved at the positive ex
tremity (518. 524.”).
   662. To avoid, therefore, confusion and circumlocution, and
for the sake of greater precision of expression than I can other
wise obtain, I have deliberately considered the subject with two
friends, and with their assistance and concurrence in framing
them, I purpose henceforward using certain other terms,
which I will now define. The poles, as they are usually called,
are only the doors or ways by which the electric current
passes into and out of the decomposing body (556.); and they
of course, when in contact with that body, are the limits of                                          its
extent       the direction of the current.

electricity  is passing into and out of the substance would
have an invariable reference, and exhibit constantly the same
relations of powers.         Upon this notion we purpose calling
that towards the east the anode*, and that towards the west
the cathode +; and whatever changes may take place in our
views of the nature of electricity and electrical action, as they
must affect the natural standard referred to in the same direc
tion, and to an equal amount with any decomposing substances
to which these terms may at any time be applied, there seems
no reason to expect that they will lead to confusion, or tend
in any way to support false views.              The anode is therefore
that surface at which the electric current, according to our
present expression, enters: it is the negative extremity of the
decomposing body; is where oxygen, chlorine, acids, &c., are
evolved; and is against or opposite the positive electrode.
The cathode is that surface at which the current leaves the
decomposing body, and is                         its
                                         positive extremity; the com
bustible   bodies,  metals,   alkalies,    and bases, are evolved there,
and           contact with the negative electrode.

 decomposition as the one I have propounded; for if it be ad
 mitted, as is generally the case, that the more directly bodies
are opposed to each other in their attractive forces, the more
 powerfully do they combine, then the objection applies with
 equal force to any of the theories of electrolyzation which
 have been considered, and is an addition to those which
I  have taken against them.
   675. Amongst powerful compounds which are not decom
 posed, boracic acid stands prominent (408.). Then again,
the iodide of sulphur, and the chlorides of sulphur, phos
phorus, and carbon, are not decomposable under common
circumstances, though their elements are of a nature which
 would lead to a contrary expectation. , Chloride of antimony
 (402. 690.), the hydro-carbons, acetic acid, ammonia, and
many other bodies undecomposable by the voltaic pile, would
seem to be formed by an affinity sufficiently strong to indicate
that the elements were so far contrasted in their nature as to
sanction the expectation that the pile would separate them,
especially as in some cases of mere solution (530. 544.), where
the affinity must by comparison be very weak, separation
takes place".
   676. It must not be forgotten, however, that much of this
difficulty, and perhaps the whole, may depend upon the ab
sence of conducting power, which, preventing the transmis
sion of the current, prevents of course the effects due to                                   it.

and being proportionate to the quantity of elements separated
(821.).     I may not, however, stop to discuss this point ex
perimentally at present.
   678. When a compound contains such elements as are
known to pass towards the opposite extremities of the voltaic
pile, still the proportions in which they are present appear to
be intimately connected with capability in the compound of
suffering or resisting decomposition.        Thus, the protochloride
of tin   readily   conducts, and is decomposed (402.), but the
perchloride neither conducts nor is decomposed (406.). The
protiodide of tin is decomposed when fluid (402.); the per
iodide is not (405.). The periodide of mercury when fused
is not decomposed (691.), even though it does conduct.                was              I
unable to contrast it with the                   the latter being con
verted into mercury and periodide by heat.
    679. These important differences induced me to look more
closely to certain binary compounds, with a view of ascertain
ing whether a law regulating the decomposability according to
some relation of the proportionals or equivalents of the ele
ments, could be discovered.            The proto compounds only,
amongst those just referred to, were decomposable; and on
referring to the substances quoted to illustrate the force and
generality of the law of conduction and decomposition which
I  discovered (402.), it will be found that                     all
                                                      the oxides, chlo
rides, and iodides subject              it,

                                of to
mony and the periodide             mercury, (to which may now per
haps     be  added corrosive sublimate,) are also decomposable,
 whilst   many   per compounds          of
                                      the same elements, not subject
to   the law,  were not   so  (405. 406.).

   692. When perchloride of mercury was subjected to the
voltaic current, it did not conduct in the solid state, but it did
conduct when fluid. I think, also, that in the latter case it
was decomposed; but there are many interfering circumstances
which require examination before a positive conclusion can
be drawn.
   693. When the ordinary protoxide of antimony is subjected
to the voltaic current in a fused state, it also is decomposed,
although the effect from other causes soon ceases (402.801.).
This oxide consists of one proportional of antimony and one
and a half of oxygen, and is therefore an exception to the ge
neral law assumed. But in working with this oxide and the
chloride, I observed facts which lead me to doubt whether the
compounds usually called the protoxide and the protochloride
do not often contain other compounds, consisting of single
proportions, which are the true proto compounds, and which,
in the case of the oxide, might give rise to the decomposition
above described.
   694. The ordinary sulphuret of antimony is considered as
being the compound with the smallest quantity of sulphur,
                              it its
and analogous in           proportions       the ordinary protoxide.

      I                  if    fused with metallic antimony,

                is                                     the metal than     of
the former, and separating distinctly, when fused, both from
the pure metal               on
                         the one hand, and the ordinary gray sul
phuret      on
             the other.          some rough experiments, the metal
                                        In
thus taken up            by
                         the ordinary sulphuret         antimony was      of
equal       half the proportion
           to                             that previously
                                                      of      the sul                in
phuret,     inwhich case the new sulphuret would consist                                             of
single proportionals.
   695. When this new sulphuret was dissolved                 muriatic               in
acid, although       little antimony separated, yet
                         a                                appeared             it                    to

                a                                      single propor      of
tionals, was formed, and from that, by alkalies, &c.,             true                      a
protoxide, consisting also          single proportionals was obtain
                                            of

                I                      ascertain this matter strictly
                                                 to
 by analysis.
   696.   I believe, however, that there         such an oxide; that
                                                                is

called  protoxide,   throwing     uncertainty  upon  the results    its                         of
analysis, and causing the electrolytic decomposition above de
scribed.
   697. Upon the whole,             appears probable that
                                            it                   those                    all

cause of their departure from this simplicity of composition,
that boracic acid, ammonia, perchlorides, periodides, and many
other direct compounds of elements, are indecomposable.
    698. With regard to salts and combinations of compound
bodies, the same simple relation does not appear to hold good.
I  could not decide this by bisulphates of the alkalies, for as
long as the second proportion of acid remained, water was
retained with           The fused salt, therefore, conducted, and

                       a              soda was prepared; and this,
                                            of                                                          I
think,   is    an

proportionals the same effect took place.
    701. Hence this class               of
                                   compound combinations does not

required to evolve the elements upon as small a surface as
possible, the metallic extremity, instead of being a plate, con
sisted of the wire bent into the form of a ring (fig. 6..).
When these tubes were used as measurers, they were filled
with the dilute sulphuric acid, and inverted in a basin of the
same liquid (fig. 7.), being placed in an inclined position, with
their mouths near to each other, that as little decomposing
matter should intervene as possible; and also, in such a direc

    715. Experiments            of
                                 similar kind were made with the
                                     a
single-plate, straight tubes (707.), and also with the curved
tubes (708.), with similar consequences; and when these, with
the former tubes, were arranged together              various ways, the
                                                               in

                 to                   of

surfaces when delivering and receiving the same current                                      of
electricity, was constantly the same.           As      illustration, the

following numbers are given. An instrument with two wires
evolved 74.8 volumes                 of
                                mixed gases; another with plates

Definite Electrolytic Action, with different-sized Electrodes. 175
78.25 volumes; whilst the sum of the oxygen and hydrogen
in two separate tubes amounted to 73-65 volumes. In an
other experiment the volumes were 55-3, 55.3, and 54'4.
   716. But it was observed in these experiments, that in
single-plate tubes (707.) more hydrogen was evolved at the
negative electrode than was proportionate to the oxygen at
the positive electrode; and generally, also, more than was
proportionate to the oxygen and hydrogen in a double-plate
tube. Upon more minutely examining these effects,                      was                I
led to refer them, and also the differences between wires and
plates (714.), to the solubility of the gases evolved, especially
at the positive electrode.
    717. When the positive and negative electrodes are equal
in surface, the bubbles which rise from them in dilute sul
phuric acid are always different in character. Those from
the positive plate are exceedingly small, and separate instantly
from every part of the surface of the metal, in consequence
of     perfect cleanliness (633.); whilst

the plates, attribute

 fore in contact with the fluid by a much smaller surface, and
 for a much shorter time than those at the plates; hence less
 solution and a greater collection.
    719. There was also another effect produced, especially by
 the use of large electrodes, which was both a consequence
 and a proof of the solution of part of the gas evolved there.
 The collected gas, when examined, was found to contain small
 portions of nitrogen.     This I attribute to the presence of air
 dissolved in the acid used for decomposition.              It is a well
 known   fact, that when bubbles of a       gas but  slightly  soluble in
 water or solutions pass through them, the portion of this gas
 which is dissolved displaces a portion of that previously in
 union with the liquid: and so, in the decompositions under
 consideration, as the oxygen dissolves, it displaces a part of
 the air, or at least of the nitrogen, previously united to the
 acid; and this proceeds most extensively with large plates, be
 cause the gas evolved at them is in the most favourable condi
 tion for solution.
    720. With the intention of avoiding this solubility of the
gases as much as possible,             I
                                   arranged the decomposing plates
in a vertical     position  (707. 708.), that the bubbles might
quickly escape upwards, and that the downward currents in
 the fluid should not meet ascending currents of gas.                This
precaution    I found to assist greatly in producing constant re
sults, and especially in experiments to be hereafter referred
  to,
 in    which other liquids than dilute sulphuric acid,             for in as
 stance solution   of potash, were used.

results  of  two   or  three experiments.       They may also          al        be
most entirely avoided         by
                              selecting that solution which         found   is
to  favour them    inthe least degree (728.); and still further                       by
collecting the hydrogen only, and using that              the indicating
                                                                as

intensity.    In the first place, the preceding experiments were
repeated, using batteries         of   an
                                    equal number               of
                                                         plates, strongly
and   weakly  charged;    but the results were alike. They were

then repeated, using batteries sometimes containing forty, and
at other times only five pairs of plates; but the results were
still the same.       Variations therefore in the intensity, caused by
difference in the strength of charge, or in the number of                                                al
ternations used, produced no difference as to the equal action of
large and small electrodes.
    724. Still these results did not prove that variation in the
intensity of the current was not accompanied by a corre
sponding variation in the electro-chemical effects, since the
actions at all the surfaces might have increased or diminished
together. The deficiency in the evidence                    however, com      is,
 pletely supplied               by

and found them            yield astonishingly uniform results.
                               to                                         But

      Definite Electrolytic Action, with different Solutions.  179
many    of them which are connected with a secondary action
will be more usefully described hereafter (778.).
   730. When solutions of caustic potassa or soda, or sulphate
of magnesia, or sulphate of soda, were acted upon by the elec
tric current, just as much oxygen and hydrogen was evolved
from them as from the diluted sulphuric acid, with which they
were compared.        When a solution of ammonia, rendered a
better conductor     by sulphate of ammonia (554.), or a solution
of subcarbonate of     potassa was experimented with, the hydro
gen evolved was in the same quantity as that set free from the
diluted sulphuric acid with which they were compared. Hence
changes in the nature of the solution do not alter the constancy
of electrolytic action upon water.
   731.   I have already said, respecting large and small elec
trodes, that change of order caused no change in the general
effect (715.).   The same was the case with different solutions,
or with different intensities; and however the circumstances
of an experiment might be varied, the results came forth ex
ceedingly consistent, and proved that the electro-chemical
 action was still the same.
   732. I consider the foregoing investigation as sufficient to
prove the very extraordinary and important principle with
respect to water, that when subjected to the influence of the
electric current, a quantity of it is decomposed exactly propor
tionate to the quantity of electricity which has passed, notwith
standing the thousand variations in the conditions and circum
stances under which it may at the time be placed; and further,
that when the interference of certain secondary effects (742.
&c.), together with the solution or recombination of the gas
and the evolution of air, are guarded against, the products of
the decomposition may be collected with such accuracy, as to
afford a very excellent and valuable measurer of the electricity
concerned in their evolution.
   733. The forms of instrument which I have given, figg.
9, 10, 11. (709. 710. 711.), are probably those which will be
found most useful, as they indicate the quantity of electricity
by the largest volume of gases, and cause the least obstruc
tion to the passage of the current.      The fluid which my pre
sent  experience   leads me to  prefer, is a solution of sulphuric
acid of specific gravity about 1.336, or from that to specific
gravity 1:25; but it is very essential that there should be no
organic substance, nor any vegetable acid, nor other body,
which, by being liable to the action of the oxygen or hydro
gen evolved at the electrodes (773. &c.), shall diminish their
quantity, or add other gases to them.

    734. In many cases when the instrument is used as a com
parative standard, or even as a measurer, it may be desirable
to collect the hydrogen only, as being less liable to absorption
or disappearance in other ways than the oxygen; whilst at the
same time           its

rect view of the general aspect of the epidermis; and if he ex
tends his researches further, he will very probably meet with
varieties of structure different from any that have been yet
specified. Nature loves to luxuriate in varieties, and further
varieties have been accordingly met with.
     Mr. F. Bauer, of Kew, describes the cuticle of Doryanthes
hastata Corréa as consisting of two or three stories of cells laid
 one above another, and exhibiting in their aggregate aspect
a resemblance to that of a honeycomb.                The epidermis of
the inner surface of the petals of Crocus vernus presents the
 similitude, neither of a network of fibres, nor of stories of
 minute cells, but of a thin and individual layer of parallel and
 tangent reeds of unequal lengths, interspersed with multitudes
 of minute and shining points, or molecules, and resembling a
 front view of the false pipes of an organ.         Finally, in the stem
 and branch of       woody  plants,  the   epidermis   often exfoliates,
 and is again regenerated even if destroyed by accident; but in
 herbaceous plants, and in the leaf, flower, and fruit of other
 plants, the epidermis never exfoliates, and is never again re
 generated if once destroyed.
     The Pulp.–The pulp, or cellular tissue, is a soft and succu
 lent substance, constituting the principal mass of herbaceous
 plants, and a notable proportion of many parts even of woody
 plants.      It abounds in the seed-lobes and in succulent fruits,
 of which any one may easily satisfy himself by cutting up,
  whether in a longitudinal or transverse direction, a bean or
 an apple recently gathered from the stalk or tree. It is also
 particularly conspicuous in the leaf and flower, with their foot
  stalk, when stript of the epidermis. , Nor is it wanting even
  in the stem of woody plants, though it is cognizable, at least
  as a separate organ, only in the pith or in the bark of the
  young and tender shoots, where it constitutes a thin layer im
  mediately under the epidermis, and forms a sort of secondary
  integument to the plant, known among botanists by the name
                                                                 in its

  green, and       the seed-lobes
                    in              white;   while    flowers and fruits

  be added, however, that Mirbel could not account for the
 fact of the lateral transmission of sap, except through the
  channel of visible pores; while Dutrochet, by means of the
 agency of molecular infiltration, can account for it very well
  without them *.
     The Pith.-The pith, as has been already shown, is a soft
 and spongy, but often succulent substance, occupying the
 centre of the root, stem, and branches, and extending in the
 longitudinal axis of the plant, in which it is inclosed as in a
 tube.    Its structure is similar to that of the pulp, being com
 posed of an assemblage of hexagonal cells, containing for the
 most part a watery and colourless juice. Mirbel regards it as
 being furnished with pores like those already described; but
 Dutrochet denies their existence, and contends that the fan
 cied pores are merely minute molecules imbedded in the walls
 of the cells like those of the pulp. He designates them by
 the name of nervous corpusclesf; and affirms, besides, that
 there is no pith in the roott. In many roots, we admit that
 there is no visible pith; but                            let
                                        any one examine the root                                                     of

             As the layers recede from the circumference, the
network which they
and their texture more
                            is finer, though still very irregular,
                          compact.     Yet the meshes of the dif
ferent layers often correspond, and form, at least in aged
trunks, pyramidal apertures, or widen into large gaps or
chinks, as in the trunk of the Oak or Elm, exhibiting still the
rough traces of the original network. In young trees or shoots
the apertures formed by the coincidence of the meshes are not
yet left empty, but are occupied by a pulp, somewhat com
pressed, which traverses the longitudinal fibres, and binds and
cements them together.
     In   all
           trunks the inner layers are soft, smooth, and flexible,
and capable            of
                    subdivision till reduced               absolute film,        to      an

no longer regenerated.
    The Ligneous Layers.—The ligneous layers,                 layers con                      or

 two different sets, concentric layers and divergent layers.

PERCEIVING
  development of the principle of least pressure, I presume
that the discussion, which was introduced by Mr. Earnshaw,
respecting the validity of the principle, has terminated.
Without entering, therefore, upon the general question, in
the fate of which I have no other interest than every lover of
science must be supposed to have, I may be allowed to ex
press my disappointment at the unsatisfactory result of that
portion of the argument which, if conclusively handled, was
likely to have proved the most impressive.         allude to that              I
passage in which the Rev. Professor's reasoning assumed the
tangible form of an equation.       That this was regarded by
both the disputants as a critical point, is abundantly apparent;
and, in fact, if the general theory is “such, in
                                                                                        it its

 one subsidiary equation         employed, the result must                                                 at     all

                       of   Vision.        By Mrs. GRIFFITHs.”
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
 THE          main object which induced me to communicate the
        curious discovery of the vision of the retina, was to elicit
  the attention of the English philosophers to that part of it
  which related to the seat of vision. This question has been
  lost sight of entirely; and although                          I
                                                   have been gratified with
  the zeal with which Sir David Brewster has pursued the ex
  periment, yet it has taken a different course from the one so                                             I
  much desired.
     In the remarks on my communication, the Editor observes
  that “some of the conclusions in the paper, especially those
  about the seat of vision, are not correct.”             It is not specified
  in what the error consists.             assert on Igood  grounds that the
 office of the retina is to contract and dilate the pupil.             When
  the pupil contracts, the intersections or meshes of the retina
  are elongated, and of course they are thinner, and the inter
  stices or squares between are larger. When the pupil dilates,
 the lines, or meshes, or intersections, whatever they may be
 called, are thicker, and the spaces between are smaller.
  Surely this proves that the retina is of an elastic nature, and
 its  office     sufficiently well defined.

            it                    suppose that part

 gularly constructed can transmit the impressions                    external                  of

 gular intervals            of
                          interstices, and these squares are for ever
 varying with every change                  light;   of which way, there  in
 fore, could this separate apparatus transmit                     the various            all

lied.       That analysed by Da Costa occurs wherever the trap
dykes cut the chalk”.             Dr. M'Donnell, who first noticed this
mineral, informs me, that it was pronounced to be dolomite by
several skilful mineralogists and chemists to whom he showed
it at various times. The analysis of Da Costa, however, gave
no magnesia. The other mineral yielded to Dr. Thomson
some portion of that earth. It has been found only at Down
hill in Derry, in veins and irregular masses in an amygdaloid
of a loose texture, accompanied by zeolites and the common
                                                   I
carbonate of lime. On these grounds think the two minerals
may be regarded as distinct; an analysis of the magnesian one
will most probably be given in full in the work on mineralogy
 for some time expected from the pen of the distinguished
 chemist just named. In the System of Professor Mohs, and
 the excellent “Manual,” by Robert Allan, Esq., just published,
 this and several others, usually described as distinct, are
 classed under calcareous spart.
      It was stated in the “Catalogue,” that the large crystals of
 quartz so frequent at Dungiven were found in a trap rock.
 I   believe this is inaccurate. Some of the crystals are found in
 the bed of the river Roe, which is partly primitive; others are
 found in the debris of mountains of the basaltic range, but
 have most probably been transported thither by currents from
 the primitive country to the west.               Small crystals of quartz,
 however, are frequent in our trap rocks.                     Hydrolite and
 levyne have been recently found in other places within the
 basaltic district besides Island Magee, and anhydrous disili
 cate of iron in dykes and loose boulders of trap near Larne.
  Mr. M'Adam suggests that it ought to have been mentioned
  in the “Catalogue,” as a remarkable circumstance, that the
  magnetic or octahedral iron ore found by him in the Isle of
  Muck, occurs only on the external surface of the rock.
      The researches of Lieut. James, R.E., in the county of
  Down, and the zealous labours of Mr. Patrick Doran in all
     * It perhaps ought to be observed, that this mineral may have been
  found in the vicinity of the Causeway, but certainly not immediately there;
  because there is no chalk at the Causeway, nor, so far as I am aware, at
  any place in the trap district where columnar basalt exists. In such a case
  that rock rests on lias or sandstone.
      + [We are obliged to Mr. Bryce for his reply to our inquiry.       We do
  not know what edition of Prof. Mohs's System he may refer to, but in
  Haidinger's Translation neither of the minerals in question is adverted to,
  either by name or by implication; nor would it be in accordance, we think,
   with Prof. Mohs's principles of classification, to include them “under
   calcareous spar”: the other minerals “usually described as distinct” but
   which are also regarded by that mineralogist as varieties of calcareous spar,
   consist, essentially, like that mineral, of carbonate of lime alone, and are
   also connected with it into one species by gradual transitions of external
   character, or by what in Zoology and Botany is termed affinity.—E. W. B.]

198             Prof. Young on the Development of certain
parts of the country, have added some new and very interest
ing minerals to our former catalogue. The following is a
list of these :
   Variolite.- This variety of compact felspar has been lately
met with in the hornblende rock of Morne.
   Anthracite.—A compact variety of this mineral, with a
highly metallic lustre, occurs frequently in the grauwacké of
Down.                                                                                           º
    WhiteCarbonate of Lead—accompanies galena and the green
phosphate of lead in the Newtonard's lead-mine, Down.
   Colophonite.—This mineral occurs in quartz veins travers
ing siliceous slate near Glassdrummond, Morne. It is of a
brownish yellow colour, and is crystallized in rhombic do
decahedrons, with very unequal angles, and having striae pa
rallel to the lesser axis of the rhomboid.       The mineral has
very much the appearance of cinnamon stone.
   Sulphuret of Molybdena.-This mineral has been lately dis
covered in a siliceous slate, or,                        I
                                       believe, rather a chlorite
slate, on the shore near the mountains of Morne. The cry
stalline form is a six-sided table, terminated by a low six-sided
pyramid, of which the base angles are truncated.          Neither
this mineral nor the colophonite have, so far as      know, been              I
before noticed in Ireland.          Yours, &c.

when it terminates in the fourth quadrant they are positive, as

the upper sign being used when k + 1 is odd, and the lower
when it is even, k + 1 being either positive or negative.
  The series for y = cos-ºw is inferred from the following
conditions, which are said to have place when a = 0, viz.

  But the first of these conditions is true only when the pro
posed arc, y, terminates in the first quadrant.       it termi                           If
nate in the fourth, y must be                        +,      when         w    = 0; if it termi
nate in the fifth, y must be                         #:      if    in the eighth, y must be

&c., have signs contrary to those which they have in the first;
in the fifth the signs are the same as in the first; in the eighth
opposite, and so on. , Hence the general expression for the

THE   profound research, the acute discrimination, and the
  eloquent expression of facts, of arguments, or of opinions
displayed in the writings of M. De Candolle, have                                                   obtained
for their author a high and well-merited reputation,                                                 whether
as a botanist or phytologist; so much so, that we                                                   shall not
err if we apply to him the well-known maxim of                                                       Horace,
 which says,
           - ** * - - - - - - - - Cui lecta potenter erit res,
                     Nec facundia deseret hunc, nec lucidus ordo.

     I had       been repeatedly led to make this application       of the
maxim in      perusing   different portions    of his  Physiologie   Végé
tale; but especially in a late perusal of the Considérations
Préliminaires which he affixes to that work, and in which he
presents to the notice of the reader a succinct and correct
view of the true principles of phytological investigation, mark
ing specifically the path to be pursued and the errors to be
avoided. The structure of the several organs of vegetables,
as in a state of rest, is the first branch of the study of the
phytologist—that                   is,
                           the anatomy         the plant; their agency

    the oeconomy         vegetation the second—that
                                of                              the study                     is,

they assumed the aid of susceptibilities of a higher order, sus
ceptibilities which in the animal subject are termed cerebral.
Yet the leading advocates of this opinion have not been no
vices; they have not been men of mean reputation, whether
in literature or in science; they did not take up the doctrine
at random ; they took it up deliberately and advisedly, and
hence their opinions are entitled to our respectful considera

He knew merely the laws by which a certain principle acts,
and he gave it a name. Beyond that he knew nothing. The
same is the case with the physiologist who talks of a vital
principle, and with the phytologist who ascribes the descent
of the radicle to a cause analogous to that of animal instinct.
He knows very well that he is ignorant of the cause any
further than as producing effects that can result only from the
exertion of the vital energies of the plant; and to the energies
thus exerted he gives the name of instinct.            The best and
most acute of our phytologists have felt the strong leaning that
exists in the human mind to the admission of some such prin
ciple. What says Dutrochet in his Observations sur la Motilité
des Végétauw? “En voyant cette diversité de moyens employés
pour parvenir à un même fin, on serait presque tenté de croire
qu'il existe la une intelligence secrète qui choisit les moyens
les plus convenables pour accomplir une action determinée.”
(p. 132.)
    For myself,       I
                     have abandoned the use of the term instinct
entirely; not because the admission of vegetable instinct is a
confession of our ignorance of the cause,_for it is better to
confess our ignorance of a cause than to adduce a false one,—
 but because it is a term calculated to mislead the phytological
student, as being so long usurped by the zoologist, and a
 term, the legitimate use of which seems to me to be that of
 the denoting of the act of an individual being regarded as
 sentient, rather than that of the denoting of the growth of any
 organ or fabric, whether animal or vegetable.           Hence, as                        I
 disclaim the doctrine of     vegetable   sensation *, I disclaim, of
 necessity, that of vegetable instinct also.
    Still    I
             cannot adopt the opinion of those who ascribe the
 descent of the radicle merely to the force of gravitation.       To
 me the phaenomenon seems to be essentially a vital process,
 which the phytologist is not to confound with any process
 that is essentially either chemical or mechanical.       This is an
 error, against the commission of which M. De Candolle is at
 great pains to guard his reader in his Considérations Prélimi
 nairest, and yet, after all, he no sooner finishes his admoni
 tions than he seems to me to fall into it himself; for he an
 nounces his adoption of Mr. Knight's theory of the descent of
 the radicle,_ that       is,
                           the accounting for vital phaenomenon

ground   I know not, unless as involved in the theory of Mr.
Knight, adopts an additional opinion, which I cannot help re
garding as erroneous also.    It is the opinion by which vege
tating roots are supposed to receive their increments of length
solely by the extreme points.              “Les racines ne s'alongent
 que par leur extremité”.”         That this was the result of some
experiments of Duhamel and of Mr. Knight, we do not mean
to deny; but it is good only as far as it goes. You are not to

facts   of the case, at least as they have presented themselves
to  my   inspection.   To me the spongioles seemed to present
the   palpable rudiments of a vascular tissue also.
    It had been asserted by Duhamel and others, that the ex
treme fibrils of the roots of plants die annually, in the winter,
and are renovated in the spring, in the manner, it may be
presumed, of leaves.      Mr. Knight admitted the position with
regard to bulbous roots, but denied it with regard to the
roots of trees. To satisfy myself on this point, I took up por
tions of the roots of several different plants, trees chiefly,
which brought the structure of the spongioles unavoidably
under my notice.
    On the first of September 1828, I took up a portion of the
root of a plant of the horse-chestnut, which had come up from
seed in the preceding spring. The fibrils, which were for the
most part in a vigorous state, presented the appearance of a
cylindrical mass of pulp, of a whitish colour, inclosing a firm
and central filament, and terminating ultimately in an enlarged
and flattened point, the spongiole of De Candolle,_which,
when cut open, was found, as well as the rest of the fibril, to
inclose a fine and central filament, or rather a bundle of such
filaments united into one cord, like the filaments that compose
the nerves of animals. A few had begun to decay, and their
decay was indicated by the shrinking and shrivelling up of the
external and pulpy mass.       But if some were thus in decay,
others were     beginning   to shoot out fresh and vigorous from
the   larger  divisions of the chevelure, so that there was no ap
pearance of the commencement of any regular denudation of
the root, whether by the decay of fibril or of spongiole.
    On the 17th I took up the whole plant, and the appearances
were as before.
    On the 15th of November I took up a plant of dwarf box,
but did not find a single fibril in decay. The newly formed
ones were covered with a white, dense, and fine down through
out the greater part of their length, but at the origin and
point they were smooth. They were also more tapering than
those of the horse-chestnut,
                          -      and had less of the club-shaped
appearance.
    On the 28th I took up part of the root of an apricot, but
found no fibril wholly in decay.        The outer coat of some of
them was indeed in decay, but the central filament was still
full of moisture, and a new coat forming.
    On the first of December I had some portions of the root
of an elm-tree taken up, at about ten or twelve feet from the
caudex.      They were well furnished with fibrils, many of
which were in decay, but their loss was more than compen

sated by a new and vigorous progeny, protruding, like little
buds, from the surface of the larger divisions. Like those of
the horse-chestnut, they terminated ultimately in a soft bibu
lous and club-shaped appendage, or spongiole, furnished with
a central filament, that seemed to inclose others still smaller.
The external and pulpy coat of the spongiole was often found
to be in decay, while the inclosed and central filament was
still quite sound.
   From the above observations respecting roots, the two fol
lowing inferences are obviously deducible.
   I. The root is never wholly denuded of fibrils,              spon                        its

    The author considers the preceding inferences as a legitimate
induction from the observed and recorded facts; and proceeds
to suggest an explanation of the gradual sinking and subsequent
elevation of the ground on which the temple stands.                      From some
experiments of Col. Totten, recorded in Silliman's Journal, he has
calculated a table of the expansion, in feet and decimal parts, of
granite, marble, and sandstone, of various thicknesses, from 1 to
500 miles, and produced by variations of temperature of                           20°,                             1°,

    The district of which the transported materials are described
 is bounded on the west by the transition rocks, extending from the
 environs of Ludlow to the S.W. of Kington, and on the E. by the
 Abberley Hills, thus including a large portion of the trough of old
 red sandstone. It is shown that all the detritus within these limits
 has been derived from the adjacent rocks.      In the neighbourhood
 of  Kington  bowlders of the   contiguous  trap  rocks are found upon
 the talus of the Ludlow rocks, extending to the edge of the old
 red sandstone, and in the plain W. of Ludlow the surface of the
 old red is frequently covered with coarse gravel, in which are
 numerous fragments of the trap rocks of the W. of Shropshire.        In
 general, however, the gravel is chiefly made up of the debris of trans
ition rocks, the coarser varieties being found only near the boun
 dary of those formations. Detailed sections are given in the neigh
 bourhood of Ledbury; and the valley of the Teeme is particularly
 described to prove that, on receding from the transition chains,
 the gravel becomes more finely comminuted, and exhibits near
Tenbury the characters of lacustrine or fluviatile sediments, the
materials of which consist exclusively of fragments of the surround
ing rocks of old red sandstone.
    Two remarkable cases of a modern travertin, 5 and 8 miles E.
of Tenbury, are then cited, the one near the Spouthouse farm, the
other the Southstone Roch, both of which have been accumulated
in narrow dells, which intersect transversely promontories of the
old red sandstone.      At the former the travertin is associated
with much sandy marl.      The latter is a cavernous rock of about
50 feet in height, and has a superficies of more than a quarter of
an acre, having on       its
                        surface    small house and garden.
                                          a                        both                  In
cases the travertin incloses Helices        existing species, and has
                                                         of

    These modern rocks are shown                    to

 old red sandstone, and still encrust the leaves and grasses over
 which they flow,    a   process which the author (judging from the
 size   ofthe rocks   produced)     supposes             to
                                                  have been      undisturbed  in

    A paper was afterwards read, “On the several Ravines, Passes, and
Fractures in the Mendip Hills and other adjacent Boundaries of the
Bristol Coal-field, and on the geological Period when they were ef
fected,” by the Rev. David Williams, F.G.S.
   The district included in this memoir comprehends the western
portion of the Mendip Hills, and the western and north-western
boundaries of the Bristol coal-field. It presents a series of lofty ridges
composed of mountain limestone and traversed by deep transverse
ravines which connect the valleys on the opposite sides of the ridges.
The author describes, in great detail, the characters, both physical
and geological, of each ravine; and shows that in consequence of
their being filled, in part, with horizontal beds of dolomitic conglo
merate, red marl, and lias, they were formed previously to the
deposition of those formations; but he also shows that the ravines
have been subsequently acted upon by a body of water, forming
what he terms valleys of denudation in valleys of elevation.
   In describing the defile of St.Vincent's Rocks, near Bristol, the
author states, that he has discovered two lines of fracture indepen
dent of the one noticed in the memoir of Dr. Buckland and Mr.
Conybeare on the south-western coal-field*. He says that the prin
cipal evidence which he has of the existence of these two faults,
rests on the beds of clay, belonging to the lower limestone shale,
occurring twice on both sides of the ravine between the first fault
and the commencement of the shale beds in their true position
beneath the mountain limestone.
   In alluding to the bone-caves and fissures of the Mendip Hills,
the author conceives that they were formed contemporaneously
with the ravines; and that he had found among their organic
contents the remains of the Mastodon.
   April 23.-A paper was first read, “On the Tertiary Forma
tions of the Kingdom of Murcia, in Spain,” by Charles Silvertop,
Esq., retired Brigadier in the Spanish Service, K. R. O. C. III.,
F.G.S.
   This memoir is a continuation of papers on the tertiary formations
of the South of Spain, read before the Society during the last and
preceding Sessions. The district described is situated in the south
eastern portion of the kingdom of Murcia, and consists of extensive
plains and valleys of tertiary formations, bounded by discontinuous
ridges of mica slate, transition rocks, and nummulitic limestone.
The tertiary deposits the author divides into four districts, which
he names from the principal towns situated in their immediate
neighbourhood, viz. Lorca, Totana, Alhama and Mula, and Car
tagena.
   The tertiary strata of Lorca he separates into two systems, one
characterized by the beds being horizontal, the other by their being
highly inclined.    The horizontal beds consist of reddish friable

sandstone and greyish marl.          In the sandstone the author noticed
no organic remains; but near the eastern boundary of the district he
observed, in a mass of clay mixed with sand, innumerable small
oysters; and in a yellowish, calcareous freestone, corals, clypeas
ters, pectens, and oysters.        The best points for examining the
argillaceous beds are stated to be in the ravines between Lorca and
Velez Rubio, where they consist of about fifty feet of marl, con
taining a few thin strata of reddish pulverulent sandstone, and
inclose shells belonging to the genera Pecten, Ostrea, Venus,
Tellina, Murex, Emarginula, &c. Upon the argillaceous strata
rests a bed of conglomerate in which the author found the long
hinged oyster,       abundant in the newer formations of the South of
                  so
 Spain.    The inclined system occurs in the immediate vicinity of
Lorca, and consists in the lowest part of sandy loam and sandstone,

 calcareous and quartzose freestone, and fine conglomerate; and in
the upper part of foliaceous, indurated marl,                   marl, and
gypsum.      No organic remains were noticed by the author. The
strata dip towards the north at an angle of 15 or 20 degrees, and
rest upon the highly-inclined beds of transition rocks.
    Totana. This village is about twenty miles E.N.E. of Lorca,
and is situated in a prolongation of the highly-inclined gypseous
system of the latter place.
    Alhama and Mula. In the immediate neighbourhood of Alhama
no tertiary strata occur, but to the north of the plain extending from
it to Murcia, is a hilly tract in which is situated Mula. The southern
part of this tract is composed of an immense deposit of earthy,
whitish-grey, argillaceous marl, containing numerous beds of gyp
sum and brine springs, and the northern of a thick series of
sandstone and argillaceous beds which are slightly inclined towards
the south and dip under the former.          In the alternating sandstone
and   argillaceous   beds,  portions    of the long-hinged oyster were
found.     Beneath this    series, in the neighbourhood of Mula, occur
beds of reddish   sandy  loam and sandstone, resting on highly inclined
strata of nummulitic limestone; and to the north of this ridge of lime
stone is an horizontal deposit of the tertiary, shelly freestone before
described.     Along the south-eastern border of the hilly district, the
gypseous formation is disturbed in the same manner as at Lorca
and Totana.
    Cartagena.    In the neighbourhood of this town the tertiary
strata are extensively developed, and constitute, apparently, the
whole of the great plain which ranges from Cartagena north
wards to the Fuensanta ridge.          On the southern extremity of the
plain the strata dip towards the north, and at the northern extre
mity towards the south. The surface of the district consists of
clay, marl and sand, which the author conceives have been de
rived from the decomposition of the tertiary strata. The beds from
the eastern termination of the Fuensanta ridge to the Segura, con
sist of the calcareous sandstones and comminuted shelly limestone;
and in the neighbourhood of Cartagena the same beds are well
displayed in numerous and extensive quarries.

   The author in conclusion states that M. Deshayes considers the
tertiary deposits of this portion of Murcia to belong to the second
and third epochs.
   A memoir was afterwards read, “On the Geology of the Ber
mudas,” by Lieut. Nelson, of the Royal Engineers; and communi
 cated by the President.
    The author commences the memoir with a general description of
 the form, structure, and meteorological phenomena of the Bermu
 das, and draws a minute comparison between the characters which
 they present, and those assigned by Kotzebue to the Coral Islands
 in the Pacific.
    He says that the Bermudas consist of about one hundred and
fifty islets, lying within a space of fifteen miles by five, and situated
on the S.E. side of a zone of coral reefs, approximating in form to
an ellipsis, the major axis of which is twenty-five miles and the mi
nor thirteen. The highest point is stated to be Sears Hill, 260 feet
above the level of the sea; and the undulating portions of the islands
are described as resembling sand-hills in shape, and chalk downs
in colour.
    The whole group is composed of calcareous sand and limestone,
derived from comminuted shells and corals, and the different va
rieties are associated without any definite order of position, the
harder limestones occasionally resting upon loose sand. The ar
rangement of the beds is often domed-shaped, but in many instances
the strata are singularly waved.
    The bottom of the basin within the zone of coral reefs is stated to
consist of corals, calcareous sand, and soft calcareous mud resem
bling chalk, and considered by the author to have been derived
 from the decomposition of Zoophytes.
    Under the head of encroachments, he describes the banks of
É.
 detritus thrown up by the sea, and the progress which, under
 certain circumstances, the loose sand makes in overwhelming tracts
               fertile.  He states that wherever the shrubs and creepers
   ave been   destroyed,  the sand has spread rapidly, but that it is inva
 riably stopped as soon as it arrives at a plantation or row of trees.
    The shells found by the author in the sand as well as the lime
stone, belong entirely to recent species, the most abundant being
 the Venus Pennsylvanica, which in some of the islands constitutes
entire beds. The only vegetable remains which he observed were
casts of the root of a plant considered by the natives to belong to
the palmetto which now grows upon the island.
    Caverns are stated to be very numerous, and their origin is as
signed to the undermining action of the sea.
    The memoir concludes with an account of the method by which
the author conceives coral islands and reefs are formed.
    May 7.-A paper was first read, “On the Distribution of Organic
Remains in the Lias Series of Yorkshire, with a View to facilitate
its  Identification by giving the Situation of   itsFossils,”by  W. Wil
liamson, jun., Esq.  of    Scarborough.

refers, extends from the Peak Hill near Robin Hood's Bay to the
village of Saltburn near Redcar.  The lias presents the threefold
arrangement of alum-shale, marlstone, and lias marl or lower lias
rock.
    The first of these deposits, the author says, consists of three di
stinct divisions, viz. (a) soft, rubbly shale i30 feet thick, (b) hard
shale breaking into large lamellar blocks, 30 feet thick, and (c) soft
sandy shale from 15 to 20 feet thick. The upper part of the su
perior bed of soft shale (a) is characterized by Ammonites striatulus,
A. communis, A. crassus, and Trigonia literata ; the middle portion,
from which alum is manufactured, by Ammonites Walcottii, A. he
terophyllus, and Nautilus astacoides; and the lowest by Ammonites
eraratus, A. elegans, Nucula ovum, and the remains of Saurians. The
hard shale (b) is distinguished by the presence of jet, Ammonites
elegans, Belemnites compressus, B. tubularis, and Inoceramus dubius;
and the lower bed of soft shale (c) by the great abundance of Am
monites annulatus.
    The marlstone, or second division of the lias series, is characterized
by Ammonites Hawkerensis, A. Clevelandicus, A. Stokesii, Belemnites
conicus, B. elongatus, Turbo undulatus, Dentalium giganteum, Iso
cardia lineata, Cardium multicostatum,     C. truncatum, Corbula car
dioides, Amphidesma recurvum, Mya V-scripta, M. literata, Pla
giostoma laviusculum, Pecten equivalvis, P. subladvis, Avicula inaequi
valvis, A. cygnipes, Plicatula spinosa, Modiola scalprum, M. Hillana,
and Terebratula bidens, T. subrotunda, T. tetrahedra, and T.            tri
  licata.
    The lower lias rock is distinguished by Ammonites planicosta,       Pli
 catula spinosa, Hippopodium ponderosum, Lutraria ambigua, Pinna
Jolium, Gryphaea depressa, G. Maccullochii, G. incurva, Pentacri
 nites Briareus, and P. vulgaris.
    In preparing these lists, the author says that he has omitted to
 mention those fossils which he has not seen, or those which, from
 their rarity, can be of little use in distinguishing the different sub
 divisions of the lias series; and in conclusion, he states, that he has
 found the fossils enumerated above, almost invariably in the beds to
 which he has assigned them; and he is of opinion that similar
 sections may be drawn up on the same minute scale of the contents
 of   all
        the other strata, but thatit  remains for further investigation
 to  determine to what extent.
  A    paper was afterwards read, entitled, “Observations          onthe
 Loamy Deposit called Loess       in  the Valley     the Rhine,”
                                                    of              by   C.
Lyell, Esq. For. Sec. G.S.
     this paper Mr. Lyell details some observations made by him
      In
  the summer
 in               1833, on the loess between Cologne and Heidel
                      of
berg, and     several parts
             in              ofBaden, Darmstadt, Würtemberg and
Nassau.     Near Bonn large deposits
                 on
                                           of of
                                           loess containing recent
shells rest     the gravel   of
                              the plain   the Rhine. The author
collected two hundred and seventeen entire shells,         of
                                                           which one
hundred and eighty-five individuals were      terrestrial species be
                                               of
longing     the genera Helix, Pupa, and Clausilia, and thirty-two
            to                                                           of

  aquatic species of the genera Limnea, Paludina and Planorbis. This
  large proportion of land shells, is very general in the formation.
  The author then made a collection of such shells as are now drifted
  down by the Rhine and occasionally cast ashore by the waves, in
  which case the shells for the most part retain their colour and are
  perfectly distinguishable from fossils washed out of the loess. Out
  of two hundred and seventy-three individuals thus procured, one
  hundred and forty-seven were land shells and one hundred and
  twenty-six aquatic. The author infers that if the waters of the
  Rhine were now received into a lake, the sediment of such a lake
  might contain more terrestrial than aquatic shells.
     After some observations on the hollows and furrows in the gravel
  of the Rhine which have been filled with loess, the author states
  that the interior of the crater of the volcanic mountain called the
  Roderberg is in great part filled up with pure loess, which was
  pierced to the depth of 65 feet in digging a well in 1833.            But
  although this and other sections prove the posteriority of the loess
  in general to the volcanic formations of the Eifel, Mr. Lyell ad
  mits that at Andernach there have been considerable falls of pumice,
  scoriae and volcanic sand during the period of the formation of the
  loess. In proof of this, the sections in the Kirchweg near Ander
  nach, are described.
     The loess is then stated to be spread almost everywhere over the
 tertiary and secondary strata around Mayence, Oppenheim, Alzey,
 Flonheim, Eppelsheim and Worms. There is a section of loess
  with shells, alternating several times with gravel, at the Manheim
 gate of Heidelberg.
     The loess between Heidelberg and Heilbronn appears to attain
/the height of seven or eight hundred feet above the sea. In this
 district, shells of the Succinea elongata alone are so abundant as to
 exceed in number     all the accompanying land shells. The author
  then mentions the loess near Stuttgard and between Göppingen and
  Boll in  Würtemberg.      He found   no  traces          of  it

                                               usual shells and alternates
 frequently with gravel.
     From these facts and others mentioned           the paper, the author
                                                          in
 deduces the following conclusions:—
    First, That the loess    is   of
                               the same mineral nature        the yellow as
 calcareous sediment with which the waters of the Rhine are now
 commonly charged.
    Secondly, The fossil shells contained     the loess are
                                                     in           recent  all   of
 species, consisting partly   land and partly              of
                               of of
                                                   freshwater shells.
    Thirdly, The number        individuals belonging                to
                                                            land species
 usually predominates greatly over the aquatic, and this seems now
 to   bethe case with the modern shells drifted down            by
                                                           the Rhine.

   Fourthly, Although the loess when pure appears unstratified, it
must have been formed gradually, as the shells contained in it are
numerous and almost          all
                            entire, and beds      shelly loess sometimes
                                                                of
alternate with strata       of
                          gravel            or
                                      volcanic matter.
   Fifthly, Some volcanic eruptions must have taken place during
and after the deposition         of
                              loess.
  In   conclusion, the author states that great changes must have oc
curred   in the physical geography               of
                                          the basin      the Rhine since  of
some    ofthe loess was deposited, and consequently        comparatively   at  a
modern geological era, when the recent Testacea existed.
   As the waters must have been          rest when the loamy sediment
                                                 at
was thrown     down,  we must   suppose    one                 or
                                                  many temporary lakes
and ancient barriers which have since been removed.                shown              It   is
that     assign
        to       the probable  places                of
                                           these would      very difficult,    be
and more data are required respecting the greatest height which the
loess attains.

here and there, and at Lyds Hole are jaspidified red sandstones,
with abundant veins of carbonate of lime, &c., the whole being in a
state of extreme contortion and irregularity.
   Shelve, Corndon, &c.—The mining district of Shelve is an iso
lated tract, separated from the Linley and Longmynd Hills by the
remarkable ridge of quartz rock, called the Stiper stones. It is
made up of parallel ridges of trap, and alternating depressions in
grauwacke.     The trap rocks of this district are greenstones, por
phyries, claystones, &c.     These are separated by the author into
two  classes; the one, alternating  conformably with the strata of the
third and fourth  grauwacke    formations, is supposed to be contem
poraneous with them ; the other is shown to be posterior to the
consolidation of the stratified deposits. In the contemporaneously
formed traps are several varieties, some of which, although aggre
gates of compact felspar with a concretionary structure, contain
organic remains: others graduate into the class of volcanic sand
stone. The first are best seen near Leigh Hall, the latter in the
Corndon flagstones, Mary Knoll dingle, &c., where they are largely
quarried.
.
   The other class, or the intrusive trap, rises to the greatest heights
and to the largest masses in the Corndon, Stapely, Taudley, and
Roundton Hills, which form the chief axis of the district; but there
are other linear eruptions, many of which are of extreme tenuity,
occasioning numerous alternations of trap and grauwacke.          The
trap rocks consist of greenstones, porphyritic greenstone, compact
          concretionary felspar simple and porphyritic, amygda
 oids, &c.
   Some remarkable parallel dykes are described running from north
east to south-west between beds of grauwacke, shale, and calcareous
flag, which latter in some instances is converted near the prismatic
ends of these dykes, into cream-coloured porcellanite.         In the
grauwacke adjacent to the trap are also many productive veins of
lead, which are respectively described at the Snailbach, Penally,
Bog, Gravel, Grit, and Roman Mines.
   Besides these ores of lead, sulphate of barytes, sulphuret of iron,
and carbonate of lime are very abundant.
   Stiper Stones.—This dentated and lofty ledge of quartz rock
belongs to sandstones of the fifth formation of the previous table”,
which have been altered by igneous action, and thrown up into their
present highly inclined and broken forms by the eruption of vol
canic rock, lines of which are pointed out both on the western and
eastern faces of the ridge, and some of which it is presumed    lie
                                                                  con.

   To the west and south the above district small portions

are noticed   at  Nantcribba,   Montgomery,    and   at Heblands near
Bishop's Castle.
   Breiddin Hills.-These hills are divisible into ridges running
from east-north-east  to west-south-west, which, although parallel     to

 each other, are not parallel to those previously mentioned.                    The
 eastern or chief of these is marked at one extremity by the Mid
 dleton and Moel y Golfa Hills, and at the other by those of Buil
 they and Bauseley.       In this ridge are compact felspar rocks, slaty
 porphyries, greenstone, and much concretionary rock, frequently of
 very large size. These trap rocks burst through strata of grauwacke,
 in some of which fossils of the Ludlow and Wenlock formations
 have been found.        The strata in contact are much hardened and
 fractured, and contain many veins of carbonate of lime, and sul
  phate and carbonate of barytes, &c. &c.
     The other chief ridge, or that on which Rodney's Pillar stands,
 is  composed   in great part of coarse-grained columnar greenstone,
 passing at   itsextremities into fine concretionary trap and clinkstone.

     Numerous specimens were exhibited from Mr. Cuming's collec
 tion, in illustration of a Paper by Mr. Broderip, entitled, “Descrip
 tions of several New Species of Calyptraeidae.”
     The following are the new species distributed and characterized in
  this paper:
     Subgenus CALYPTRAEA : CAL. rudis, corrugata, varia (a very vari
 able species, allied to Cal. equestris, and taking almost every shape
 which a Calyptraea can assume.         It differs in thickness according to
 localities and circumstances), cepacea, and cornea.
     Subgenus CALYPEopsis, Less.         CAL. radiata, imbricata, lignaria
  (The majority of individuals of this species have their shells so de
 formed that they set description at defiance: the comparatively well
 formed shell occurs so rarely that it may be almost considered as the
 exception to the rule. When in this last-mentioned state, the circum
 ference of the shell is an irregular, somewhat rounded oval, and it
 rises into a shape somewhat resembling the back of Ancylus, with the
 aper very sharp and inclining downwards. The shell in this shape is
 generally less corrugated than it is in deformed individuals, though
 some of those are comparatively smooth ; but in both states the shell
 is striated immediately under the aper, and is for the most part cor
 rugated on the other side of it.), tenuis, hispida, maculata, and serrata.
     SYPHoPATELLA, Less. ? CAL. sordida, Unguis, Lichen, mamillaris,
 striata, and conica.
     Subgenus CREPIPATELLA, Less.          CAL. foliacea (bears no remote
 resemblance to the upper valve of some of the Chamae when viewed
 from above), dorsata (the back of this shell is not unlike the upper
 valve of some of the Terebratula), dilatata, strigata (may possibly be
 a variety of the last), Echinus (old specimens bear a great resemblance
 to the figure of Crepidula fornicata in Sowerby's Genera of Shells,
 No. 23, f. I.), Hystric (approaching the last: but Mr. Broderip would
 not be positive that they are not          all

astringent taste ; it is soluble in absolute alcohol, and but slightly
so in alcohol of density 0-85. The chrenates of the alkaline earths
are but slightly soluble in water, and they form insoluble sub
                                                                                        except
salts. The greater part of other chrenates are insoluble
the protochrenate of iron, which is very soluble.
   Apochrenic acid is but slightly soluble in water, to which it gives
a brownish colour.            The apochrenates resemble the chrenates
strongly, but they are brown or black, insoluble in alcohol, and
combine with hydrate of alumina by digestion, forming a colourless
solution. By this method they are easily separated from the chre
nates.
   These two acids are found in several chalybeate waters in Swe
den, even when the waters are colourless.                         They may be separated
from the ochre which these waters                deposit       by    boiling it with hydrate
of  potash.    The alkali       being     afterwards saturated with acetic acid,
the  apochrenic    acid is to be        precipitated          by acetate of lead as long
as a brown    precipitate      is formed,       or   a  greenish         one, which becomes
brown. The      liquor   afterwards         neutralized         by     an   alkaline carbonate
precipitates chrenate of copper in greenish white flocks, the quan.
tity of which is increased by adding more acetate of copper. The
copper is afterwards separated from the acid by means of sulphu
            -
retted hydrogen. Even ochry iron ore contains these acids.
    The waters of Porta contain these two acids in the states of
the chrenates of soda and ammonia. In 100,000 parts of the water

    Berzelius considers the azote             disengaged            from the water, and the
ammonia which saturates the chrenic                         acid,      as the product of the
spontaneous decomposition of the two                       organic        acids; and he attri

XXXV. A. Method of          determining the Number of Signals
   which can be made by the Modern Telegraphs. By CHARLEs
   BLACKBURN, Esq., A. B.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical    Magazine and Journal.
     Gentlemen,
                     the French    telegraph or semaphore has
ALTHQUGH
     been in use for a considerable     period,  I am not aware
that any general rule for determining the number of signals
that can be made by these instruments has been given to the
public.   The following investigation, therefore, may not be
unacceptable to such of your readers as are interested in that
mode of communication.        Its object is to furnish a rule for
determining the number of distinct signals which can be made
by any semaphore, whatever be the number of arms or indi
cators, or whatever be the number of positions of each arm.
   In the Cyclopaedia of Rees, the number of signals which
the semaphores of the line of communication between Paris
and Landau were capable of making, is stated to be 823,543,
which is no less than 1,274,608 fewer than the real number,
an error not arising from the press, but from the principle of
computation.      The following method, besides giving the true
number of   signals, has the advantage of being reducible
                                                    -       to an
 expression of remarkable simplicity.
   Problem.—To find the number of signals which can be
 made by any semaphore having any given number of arms,
                                                                  -
 and each arm taking any given number of positions.

    Let AB be an upright pole or staff, carrying any number
                                                                                                  *

                                                 F &
 of positions. This will represent the modern
 telegraph or semaphore.
    Let the number of centres F, D, E, &c.
 be denoted by c, and the number of positions
 of each arm by p. Then, since the number       D                                                 Q-E
 of signals that can be made  by one arm must
 be equal to the number of positions of that
arm, the number of signals which can be
made with one arm = p, and the number of
signals on the whole, using one arm at a
time, will be cp.                              * || a

    Again, since each of the signals which can
be made by any one arm, can be repeated with each of the
signals of any other arm, it follows that the number which
can be made by any two arms together = p”. And since
the number of combinations in c things, taken two and two
together,      =    *#; !,             it follows that the whole number of sig

     The preceding investigation supposes one arm only on the
same centre, as                  in the modern semaphores; but as they may
be made with several arms on the same centre,                                             it may be
proper on some future occasion to give the method of find
ing the signals for such as have any given number of arms on
each centre, any number of centres, and any number of posi
tions of each arm; an investigation a little more complicated
than the preceding, but, like        capable           it,

                                  to   a                     Mr. Beke

the least likely      have been ignorant

we   may  infer that  they  conveyed      their posterity.    Yet have
                                                             to

                            to                     any country, that      of
the arts       ship-building and navigation had made any consi
                 of
derable progress for many ages after the Flood. How, indeed,
were they         have been acquired?
                       to                  Navigation        cultivated              is

mankind from Adam to Noah could not have so inconveniently

the arts and seek out means for the relief of an overburdened
country.     Some indeed, without the slightest warrant from
the history, neglecting the only criteria we have           the families                      in

reverence          of the worshipers,
                                   some other word would have
 been selected   to express the atonement and mercy-seat, than
 one to which the people must have been daily familiar in the
 sense of pitch and a sliming over of pitch, from their tradi
 tionary or other history, and that this is one reason, though
 not “the principal,” for inferring that the word, nowhere else
  used in that sense, is not so used here *.
    To the country near Babylon being the spot of Noah's ante
 diluvian residence, Mr. Beke objects, as being founded on
 mere tradition, mentions the place where the ark rested to be
 Armenia or the North of Mesopotamia, a statement which can
 scarcely be considered as founded on anything better, then,
 taking that as a fact, observes,“The most philosophical course
 is to assume that in the neighbourhood where the ark rested
 there also it was built.” Why, in the unequalled atmospheric
 disturbances which the narrative of the Deluge bespeaks, the
ark should be thus immoveable is not very manifest.            I as
 sume it was just as likely to be found at length in any other
spot, as in the one where such uncertain agency began to act
 upon       it.
   It  being universally allowed that Babylon (Babel             the                            in
original) was      the neighbourhood

the natural inference     that they are identical. Mr. Beke, con
                                  is
sidering that,     this period, the Persian Gulf occupied,
                      at                                         the                               or
waters      the rivers desolated, this part, denies their identity,
             of
the only reason appearing          be, that  to  the dispersion       at                                in
Peleg's days the builders are said        have “left off    tobuild                           to
the city.”    But    we consider that Nimrod was but the third

from Noah, and Peleg the fifth, the spots, which               time                           in

 248        Mr. Carter's Remarks                     on    Mr. Beke's Papers
  on the S.W. side of the Delta, and comparing it with the
  present state of the country, we learn with surprise the small
  degree of change which the general characters of the coast have
  undergone during the lapse of so many ages.               Dr. Vincent,
  in his able work “On the Commerce and              Navigation     of the
  Ancients in the Indian Ocean,” adverting to this remarkable
  fact, observes, that Capt. Howe's chart “ explains the journal
  of Nearchus as perfectly as if it had been composed by a
  person on board of his fleet,” (vol. i. p. 423.), and (p. 466.)
  “The pilot on board Nearchus's ship steered exactly the same
 course” (along the coast of the Delta,) “as Mr. Cluer's Karack
  pilot 2000 years afterwards.” The junction of the river called
  by Arrian the Eulaeus (coming from the N. or N.E.) with the
  Tigris by the still existing ancient Hoffar canal, across which
 Alexander sent a part of his fleet while he sailed down the
  Eulaeus to the mouths of the Tigris, and so round to meet
  (Arrian, Exp. Alex. vii. 7.) further shows that           the point           to                     in it,
 question any later encroachments             the  gulf    on
                                                         must        very                    be
 unimportant.
     This supposed extension                 of
                                    the Delta over nearly 400 miles
 seems, moreover,           as
                         little aided                 by
                                           Nearchus's calculation                                      of
 the distance      his time between the gulf and Babylon.
                  in                                                  Dr.
 Vincent intimates that           calling
                                        in    3300 stadia, Nearchus

                                                                                                       an to
 should      understood                      stadia
a   mile (412 miles).      To this Mr. Beke      objects      merely             as
 estimate   ofconvenience.     Now      happens itthat  Pliny, the other
 authority, who must have understood Nearchus's terms                                             of   di
 stance better than we can, expressly says, (vi. 26.) “Euphrate
navigari Babyloneme Persico mari 412 mill. pass.” (about 412
miles) “tradunt Nearchus           Onesicritus.”
                                           et       The latter was                                 pi
lot and master         of
                      Alexander's own ship. Then                  Juba's             as   to
opinion Pliny goes              say, “Juba       Babylone Characem
                                he is,on                          a
 175 mill. pass.;” that      Juba (the second) made            his time,
                                                                                     to in

adding the       50
                 miles       accountedto    from Charax
                                                      it        the sea,
225 miles only from the sea             Babylon, and this was 340
                                                to
years after the calculation                of
                                   Nearchus and Onesicritus which
made   it  412. So that we shall, perhaps,           inclined         be
                                                                    con                      to
cur with Pliny      the remark, “Inconstantiam mensurae diver
                      in
sitas auctorum facit.” From such discordant opinions                hard               it    is
to  “learn the true measure,” rather than infer from them
“  the actual rate      which the Persian Gulf had been filled
                           at
up during the 400 years immediately preceding his time.”
    Mr. Beke animadverts          Mr. Lyell’s speaking
                                        on                    the union          of
of   the Euphrates and Tigris             not manifestly within the
                                                as   if
historic aera (in Geology, vol. i.), seeing that Pliny (vi. 27.)
says that   inancient times some made         25 miles between their
                                                            it

                        on the Gopher-wood and the Persian Gulf.                                                             249
 mouths, and some 7.       But it appears from Pliny’s account,
 that long before his time they had united above the embou
 chure somewhere, not, as Mr. Beke's paper implies, by en
 croachments on the gulf and formation of delta, but simply
by the labour of hands; for Pliny immediately adds, “ sed
longo tempore Euphratem praeclusere Orcheni et accolae agros
 rigantes nec nisi Pasitigris defertur in mare.” And that the
 stream thus cut off was only one of the streams of the Delta
called in the country, as Dr. Vincent says it is to this day, the
mouth of the Euphrates, and that these rivers had a higher
junction, seems to be the only inference from other ancient
authorities, as Arrian, who, while in his Expedition of Alexan
der he says, “the Euphrates disappears in the marshes,” and

whether by the name of the Tigris or of the Euphrates, does
not seem very important; but notwithstanding some discre

about 70 miles from the sea,) where,             usual, from the want  as
of  slope and momentum, the water begins                   multiply                        to                         its

    746. The nature of the substances evolved will often lead
to a correct judgement of their primary or secondary charac
ter, but is not sufficient alone to establish that point.         Thus,
nitrogen is said to be attracted sometimes by the positive and
sometimes by the negative electrode, according to the bodies
with which it may be combined (554. 555.), and it is on such
occasions evidently viewed as a primary result”; but               think                                  I
I  shall show, that, when it appears at the positive electrode,
or rather at the anode, it is a secondary result (748.). Thus,
also, Sir Humphry Davyt, and with him the great body of
chemical philosophers, (including myself.) have given the ap
pearance of copper, lead, tin, silver, gold, &c., at the negative
electrode, when their aqueous solutions were acted upon by
the voltaic current, as proofs that the metals, as a class, were
attracted to that surface; thus assuming the metal in each
case to be a primary result.         These however, I expect to
prove, are               all
                  secondary results; the mere consequence                                                              of

drogen.       When the quantity of products was examined by
the volta-electrometer (707.), the oxygen, whether from
strong or weak acid, proved to be in the same proportion as
from water. When the acid was diluted to specific gravity
1:24, or less, the hydrogen also proved to be the same in
quantity as from water.           Hence            I
                                              conclude that the nitric
acid does not undergo electro-chemical decomposition, but
 the water only; that the oxygen at the anode is always a pri
 mary result, but that the products at the cathode are often se
condary, and due to the reaction of the hydrogen upon the
 nitric acid.

which escaped when weak solutions                   of sulphurous acid were
used.
   757. Sulphuric Acid.—I have already given my reasons for
concluding that sulphuric acid is not electrolyzable, i. e. not
decomposable directly by the electric current, but occasionally
suffering by a secondary action at the cathode from the hydro
gen evolved there (68.1.).   In the year 1800, Davy considered
the  sulphur  from sulphuric  acid as the result of the action of
the nascent hydrogen”.       In 1804, Hisinger and Berzelius
stated that it was the direct result of the action of the voltaic
pile+; an opinion which from that time Davy seems to have
adopted, and which has since been commonly received by all.
The change of my own opinion requires that I should correct
what I have already said of the decomposition of sulphuric
acid in a former series of these Researches (552.): I do not
now think that the appearance of the sulphur at the negative
electrode is an immediate consequence of electrolytic action.
   758. Muriatic Acid.—A strong solution gave hydrogen at
the negative electrode, and chlorine only at the positive elec
trode; of the latter, a part acted on the platina and a part
was dissolved.    A minute bubble of gas remained; it was not
oxygen, but probably air previously held in solution.
   759. It was an important matter to determine whether the
chlorine was a primary result, or only a secondary product,
due to the action of the oxygen evolved from water at the
anode upon the muriatic acid; i. e. whether the muriatic acid
was electrolyzable, and if so, whether the decomposition was
 º:
definite.
            The muriatic acid         was gradually
with six of water gave only chlorine at the anode.
                                                  diluted.  One part
                                                            One part
with   eight of water     gave only  chlorine;  with nine of water, a
little oxygen    appeared    with the chlorine: but the occurrence
or non-occurrence of oxygen at these strengths depended, in
part, on the strength of the voltaic battery used. With fifteen
parts of water, a little oxygen, with much chlorine, was evolved
at the anode.      As the solution was now becoming a bad con
ductor of     electricity,  sulphuric acid was added to           this               it:
caused more ready decomposition, but did not sensibly alter
the proportion        chlorine and oxygen.

       Primary and Secondary Results of Electrolyzation.                             259
  plates or one containing only 5 pairs were used. With acid of
  this strength, the oxygen evolved at the anode was to the hy
  drogen at the cathode, in volume, as 17 is to 64; and there
  fore the chlorine would have been 30 volumes, had it not been
  dissolved by the fluid.
      762. Next, with respect to the quantity of elements evolved.
  On using the volta-electrometer, it was found that, whether
  the strongest or the weakest muriatic acid were used, whether
  chlorine alone or chlorine mingled with oxygen appeared at
  the anode, still the hydrogen evolved at the cathode was a
  constant quantity, i.e. exactly the same as the hydrogen which
  the same quantity of electricity could evolve from water.
      763. This constancy does not decide whether the muriatic
  acid is electrolyzed or not, although it proves that if so, it
  must be in definite proportions to the quantity of electricity
  used. Other considerations may, however, be allowed to de
  cide the point. The analogy between chlorine and oxygen,
  in their relations to hydrogen, is so strong, as to lead almost
  to the certainty, that, when combined with that element, they
  would perform similar parts in the process of electro-decom
  position. . They both unite with it in single proportional
  or equivalent quantities; and, the number of proportionals
 appearing to have an intimate and important relation to the
 decomposability of a body (697.), those in muriatic acid, as
 well as in water, are the most favourable, or those, perhaps
 even necessary to decomposition.        In other binary compounds
 of chlorine also, where nothing equivocal depending on the
 simultaneous presence of it and oxygen is involved, the chlo
 rine is directly eliminated at the anode by the electric current.
  Such is the case with the chloride of lead (395.), which may
 be justly compared with protoxide of lead (402.), and stands
 in the same relation to it as muriatic acid to water. The
 chlorides of potassium, sodium, barium, &c., are in the same
 relation to the protoxides of the same metals, and present the
 same results under the influence of the electric current (402.).
     764. From all the experiments, combined with these con
 siderations, I   conclude that muriatic acid is decomposed by
 the direct influence of the electric current, and that the quan
 tities evolved are, and therefore the chemical action        definite    is,
for definite quantity
   a                     of electricity.   For though      have not  I

electro-chemical action      the case of muriatic acid.

  water is electro-chemically decomposed, giving origin to the
  oxygen, which appears mingled with the chlorine at the anode.
  The oxygen may be viewed as a secondary result; but I                                             in
  cline to believe that it is not so: for, if it were, it might be
  expected in largest proportion from the stronger acid, whereas
  the reverse is the fact. This consideration, with others, also
  leads me to conclude that muriatic acid is more easily decom
  posed by the electric current than water; since, even when
  diluted with eight or nine times                    its
                                                quantity     the latter fluid,

 same current from water; and iodine without any oxygen was
 evolved      at the positive electrode. But when diluted, small
 quantities     of  oxygen appeared with the iodine                the anode,     at
 the   proportion         hydrogen
                         of                     at

 turbed.

        I      believe the decomposition            the hydriodic acid
                                                            of                                      in
 this case    to    be
                     direct, for the reasons already given respecting
muriatic acid (763. 764.).
     769. Iodides.—A solution             iodideof   potassium being sub
                                                             of
jected   to   the voltaic    current,   iodine   appeared       the positive  at
electrode (without any oxygen), and hydrogen with free alkali
at    the negative electrode. The same observations                        the            as   to

          Primary and Secondary Results of Electrolyzation.                               261
mode of decomposition are applicable here as were made in
relation to the chlorides when in solution (766.).
    770. Hydro-fluoric Acid and Fluorides.—Solution of hydro
fluoric acid did not appear to be decomposed under the                                        in
fluence of the electric current: it was the water which gave
way apparently. The fused fluorides were electrolyzed (417.);
but having during these actions obtained fluorine in the sepa
rate state, I think it better to refer to a future series of these
Researches, in which                I
                             purpose giving a fuller account of the
results than would be consistent with propriety here.
    771. Hydro-cyanic acid in solution conducts very badly.
 The definite proportion of hydrogen (equal to that from
water) was set free at the cathode, whilst at the anode a small
quantity of oxygen was evolved and apparently a solution of
cyanogen formed. The action altogether corresponded with
that on a dilute muriatic or hydriodic acid.        When the hydro
cyanic acid was made a better conductor by sulphuric acid,
 the same results occurred.
    Cyanides.—With a solution of the cyanide of potassium,
 the result was precisely the same as with a chloride or iodide.
 No oxygen was evolved at the positive electrode, but a brown
 solution formed there.       For the reasons given when speaking
 of the chlorides (766.), and because a fused cyanide of potas
 sium evolves cyanogen at the positive electrode*, I incline to
 believe that the cyanide in solution is directly decomposed.
    772. Ferro-cyanic acid and the ferro-cyanides, as also sul
pho-cyanic acid and the sulpho-cyanides, presented results cor
 responding with those just described (77.1.).
    773. Acetic Acid—Glacial acetic acid, when fused (405.),
 is not decomposed by, nor does it conduct, electricity.            On

    onadding more water,          acted slowly, and about        water              as

      Acetate of soda fused and anhydrous is directly decomposed,
  being, as I believe, a true electrolyte, and evolving soda and
  acetic acid at the cathode and anode. These, however, have no
  sensible duration, but are immediately resolved into other sub
  stances; charcoal, sodiuretted hydrogen, &c., being set free
 at the former, and as far as I could judge under the circum
 stances, acetic acid mingled with carbonic oxide, carbonic
 acid, &c., at the latter.

 present in large quantity, but is merely that of combination,
  still secondary results often ensue: for instance, it is very
  possible that in Sir Humphry Davy's decomposition of the
  hydrates of potassa and soda, a part of the potassium pro
  duced was the result of a secondary action. Hence, also, a
  frequent cause for the disappearance of the oxygen and hy
 drogen which would otherwise be evolved: and when hydro
 gen does not appear at the cathode in an aqueous solution, it
 perhaps always indicates that a secondary action has taken
 place there.     No exception to this rule has as yet occurred to
  my observation.
     779. Secondary actions are not confined to aqueous solutions,
 or cases where water is present. For instance, various chlo
 rides acted upon, when fused (402.), by platina electrodes,
 have the chlorine determined electrically to the anode.               In
 many cases, as with the chlorides of lead, potassium, barium,
 &c., the chlorine acts on the platina and forms a compound
      it,                                                                           tin

                     at                         upon   the platina,  but
 upon the chloride already there, forming perchloride which       a
rises  in   vapour (790. 804.). These are, therefore, instances
of   secondary actions                of
                               both kinds, produced        bodies con         in

the entrance (between Rossal Point and Walney Island) to
Humphrey Point, a distance of fourteen miles, beyond which
the bay contracts into two narrow arms, the width varies from
 eleven to fifteen miles.

give, alike from observations of every division, the time of
high water; but as the rate will generally vary, not only from
astronomical causes, but also from sudden changes in the force
or direction of the wind, it follows that the series of times ob
tained from the several divisions will neither coincide with
each other, nor with the true instant, the error increasing
(irregularly) from the highest to the lowest division noted. In
the course of observations, frequently protracted to three hours,
as the extreme difference between the times obtained never
exceeded five minutes, the one derived from the highest divi

the true instant of high water.

6 inches, but a solitary limestone, considered as the standard
height for extreme neaps, was situated 1 foot 9 inches below
the level of our mark, which would reduce the total height of
the tide by double (?) that quantity, or to 15 feet.
   July 28, 1832, the day previous to the highest spring tide

high water (at 11" 32” A.M.) to our stake near the shore mea

down to the level of the latter at low water (at 5° 57" P.M.)
did not exceed 4 feet 7 inches, although a continuous fall was
perceptible nearly up to the time quotedt. The total height
of the tide will therefore be 29 feet 3 inches. On this occa

of level between the two stakes driven down at neaps was
carefully remeasured, and made to be 18 feet 8 inches, or only

 XXXIX.            On the Influence       of high and low Prices      on the
            Rate of Mortality.         By John BARTon, Esq.”
       a pamphlet which I published rather
  INmonths       agot, I stated at considerable

 of an  investigation      into the influence of       high   and low prices
 on the condition of the people, as evidenced by the rate of
 mortality in the kingdom at large, as well as in our agricul
 tural and manufacturing districts separately. These results
 were deduced from a comparison of the number of burials in
 the population returns with the price of wheat in each year,
 from 1780, the commencement of these returns, down to
 1820, the returns of the succeeding years not being at that time
 printed.      The subsequent completion of the work enables me
now to state the results of fifty years’ experience in this matter.
 At the same time I shall be glad to take the opportunity of
 saying a few words on an objection which has been urged
 against my conclusions by a writer in the Edinburgh Re
 View.
    The general result of my inquiry respecting the influence
 of the price of corn on the rate of mortality in the kingdom
at large will be seen in the following statement:

   “1st, That the extremes of high and low prices are both
unfavourable to the comfort and health of the labouring classes.
   “2nd, That of the intermediate prices, those are most fa
vourable which approach the higher extreme.”
   The objection taken by the reviewer to this reasoning, will
state in his own words.
                                                                                         I
   “Mr. Barton, in the pamphlet placed at the head of this
article, endeavours to prove that a high price of corn                                         di
minishes mortality; and in favour of this singular opinion he
produces tables of burials, prices, &c., from 1780. But, what
ever this gentleman may think, it does not necessarily follow,
that because two circumstances are consentaneous,        the one is
therefore the cause of the other. The improved condition
and habits of the labouring and middle classes since 1780,
coupled with the extirpation of the small-pox, and other im
provements in medical science, have occasioned a diminution
in the rate of mortality, which has more than balanced the
contrary influence of the increased price of corn.     Mr. Barton
would have been     quite as logical,  and  quite as  correct, had
he ascribed the diminished mortality to the increase in the
number of steam-engines, or to the more general employment
of children in factories.”—No. 118. p. 306.
   Does the reviewer mean,                 I
                                  would ask, to assert, that the
price of corn has been progressively and uniformly rising
since 1780, and the rate of mortality progressively and uni
formly decreasing during the same period? If not, I do not
see the force of his reasoning.                 If
                                      he does, a simple statement
of figures may  show how    widely he is mistaken.

     It is true,                           that the mere consen
                   as the reviewer observes,
taneous occurrence of two events does not afford any proof,
scarcely a presumption, that any connexion exists between
them.

282   Mr.     J.   Barton on the Influence      of high and low Prices
the averages, with the anomaly exhibited by the fourth co
lumn, which exhibits the rate of mortality in those years when
the price of wheat was between 70s. and 80s. per quarter.                It
 will be seen that the number at the foot of this column,                                   in
stead of being less than the preceding number, agreeably to
the general rule, is somewhat greater. So invariable were the
results that        I
                   had obtained in my former calculations,—so
constantly had I found that every decline of price below 100s.
per quarter is followed by an increase of deaths, that I was
surprised to meet with any exception to this general law. On
a little further examination, however, I discovered that this is
just one of those cases in which the exception serves to con
firm the rule. The anomaly in question depends entirely on
 the peculiar circumstances of the year 1795, which was, in
 fact, a year of severe scarcity, as any one may ascertain by
 referring to Burke's “Thoughts and Details on Scarcity,” or
 other contemporary writings.           The mortality of this year
 ought, therefore, to be classed with the numbers in the last
 column, though the average price of wheat did not exceed
 74s.2d.; since it is evident that              all
                                               scarcity     relative, and
                                                                  is
 that the same price which denotes                moderately abundant
                                                  a
 crop  at  one period, may indicate        ageneral failure       another   at
 period. Omitting, therefore, the year 1795, the average num
ber   of  burials per million       population,

to   be 18'596,-intermediate between the numbers on either

    If the stem of a plant of Marigold is divided by means of
a transverse   section,   the divided extremities of the longitu
dinal fibres, arranged in a circular row immediately within
the bark, will be distinctly perceived, and their tubular struc
ture demonstrated, by means of the orifices which they pre
sent, particularly when the stem has begun to wither.           The
tubular structure of the longitudinal fibres of woody plants is
not so easily demonstrated.       We might infer      however, from                  it,

 Mirbel than   ever   Kieser was.     It is to the eclaircissemens of
 Dutrochet that we are indebted for any new light that has
been lately thrown on the structure of the sap-vessels.          Still
we cannot do without Mirbel.         We must have him, if it were
but for the sake of refuting him, as the defenders of our faith
must have the books of the infidels.
   The vessels of plants are divided by Mirbel, into sap-ves
sels, and proper vessels. Of the sap-vessels he enumerates
five species,—porous tubes, spiral tubes, false spiral tubes,
mixed tubes, and cellular tubes—les vaisseaua en chapelet. Of
the proper vessels he has but one species, which he calls sim
ple tubes.
   The first species of tubes containing sap are the porous
tubes.   They are described by Mirbel as having compara
tively a considerable width of diameter, and as being pierced
with multitudes of minute holes or pores distributed in parallel
and transverse rows. They abound in woody plants. They
are not continuous from the base to the summit; but they
unite, separate, and unite again, and finally disappear by
changing into cellular tissue. The doctrine of porous tubes was
attacked by the German phytologists with as much hostility as
was that of porous cells. But it met also with some strenuous
defenders; and even the antiporists themselves were obliged
to admit that the vessels in question are studded with lumin
ous points, or with little transparent vesicles, arranged as
the pores are said to be; so that at all events Mirbel's account
is not a fiction, but a mistaking of the character of certain
given appearances.       Thus the matter might have been said
to be left in doubt.      But as Dutrochet has searched for the
pores of the tubes, as he searched for the pores of the cells,
without being able to find them; and has, at the same time,
adduced strong reasons for supposing them to be merely small
and minute molecules imbedded in the substance of the mem
brane that forms the vessels*, we regard the doctrine of porous
tubes as being no longer tenable.
   The second species of tubes conducting sap is the spiral
tubes—a name not imposed, but adopted, by Mirbel, as being
long in use. They are fine, transparent, and thread-like sub
stances, occasionally interspersed with the other tubes of the
plant, but readily distinguished from them by their being
twisted in the form of a corkscrew from right to left as in the
stem of Spearmint; or from left to right as in the stem of
Fuller's Teasel.      Grew and Malpighi, who first discovered
and described them, represented them as resembling in their

 merely en passant, as the functions of the several organs of the
 plant do not come within the scope of our present inquiry.
    The third species of tubes conducting sap is the false spiral
 tubes. According to Mirbel they derive their spiral appear
  ance merely from being cut transversely by parallel fissures.
  They cannot, like the true spirals, be uncoiled, and are hence
  fitly denominated false spirals. They are said to abound in
 the Lycopodia and in Ferns, and in the soft parts of the Vine.
  But what says Dutrochet? He says that what Mirbel took to
 be parallel fissures are merely globules arranged as in the
 porous tubes; that the spires may be uncoiled by means of
 the long-continued action of nitric acid destroying the bond
 of agglutination; and that the vessels in question are, after all,
 veritable spirals”.
     The fourth species of tubes conducting sap is the mixed
 tubes, that    is,
                 tubes combining        single individual two
                                                                                           in or

 more     ofthe foregoing species.   Mirbel exemplifies them
 the case  ofthe Flowering Rush; but Dutrochet says there are
 no such vessels       as
                      mixed tubes     any plant whatever, unless

 accidental varieties are not  enough    constitute species.

formed     of

and collateral reeds.  Dutrochet admits the existence of such
                                                 by
vessels, but    hedesignates them          different name, and finds

                                   of
 out of   which they are formed, they are furnished with glo
 bules.
    The only species      proper vessels that M. Mirbel describes
                            of
is  the simple tubes. They are the largest

and elaborated juices. Dutrochet has vessels for this purpose
also, but  he does not give them the same name nor structure;
and  he  has proper   vessels likewise, but                    he
                                                   does not assign                         to

transparent membrane or pellicle, fine as the film of a single
epidermis, in which the eye, aided by the assistance even of
the best glasses, can discover no traces whatever of organiza
tion; or if any further analysis is practicable, it is that only
which conducts us to the molecules of modern philosophers.
    In the course of the foregoing investigations we have seen
the great variety of modes in which the elementary organs are
grouped, so as to constitute a class, or order, or division.
We have seen that these groupings are constant in the orders
or divisions in which they are found, and that the greater the
complexity of organization, the higher the rank of the plant,
as ascending from the lowly Flag or Fungus, to the tall and
spreading tree. It is upon this ground that we have instituted
our general distribution of plants into Perfect and Imperfect,
with the various intermediate gradations which they exhibit;
and if the two classes are compared together, the superiority
of the former will be rendered manifest, whether we regard
their external fabric or their internal structure.                     Perfect
plants are furnished with roots, by which they                    themselves  fix
firmly        tospot and absorb nourishment from the soil. Many
                a
     the imperfect plants are altogether rootless, and live only
byof                                               they are apparently
      imbibition from the atmosphere,                  or                                       a
 mere root, and are lodged wholly             the earth.
                                                  in          Perfect plants
 are furnished with stem and
                           a          branches,    giving   them elevation,
 and expansion, and        magnitude.     Many        the  imperfect
                                                            of          plants
 are altogether stemless, and are scarcely elevated above the
 level    of the soil     on
                          which they grow.         Perfect plants are fur
 nished with leaves and conspicuous flowers,                    well         as

                    to
of   the imperfect plants are destitute           leaves entirely, and
                                                       of                                       al

   Counties of Salop, Montgomery, &c.,” read May 21st,-continued.)
                                   of trap rock of about three miles in
Brecknockshire—Al<U+017F>º        length and half a mile in width, extends from
the stream of Nanteinon on the north-east to the right bank of the
Yrfon near Llanwrtyd on the south-west. The gorge, in which the
little river Cerdin flows, separates this ridge into two mountains,
Gaer Cwm and Carn Dwad.
    The predominant character of the trap is porphyritic, including
greenstones, compact felspar rocks, &c. Some of the porphyry
is columnar.      This nucleus is irregularly coated over with a thin
and broken covering of highly altered grauwacke schist, which is
frequently in the state of Lydian stone, from beneath the dislocated
beds of which bosses of trap protrude.        Other varieties of altered
rock in contorted positions are seen on the flanks of the ridge, in
some of which are crystals of iron pyrites and small portions of car
buret of iron.
    Absurd trials for coal, similar to those previously described, have
been made on the sides of these hills.      The mineral source of Llan
wrtyd    issues from the pyritized schist on the banks of the Yrfon,
and it   was from a conviction that the phenomena in this case might
be due to volcanic action similar to that noticed in the cases near
Llandrindod and Builth, that the author was induced to examine
this remote district.     The result justified his anticipations, and led
him to the discovery of this intrusive ridge.
    Caermarthenshire.—The only example of trap rock in the large
portion of Caermarthenshire which has been examined, was detected
last summer in the small rocky knoll of Blaen-Dyffrin-garn, about
three miles south-east of Llangadock.          This trap is more or less
porphyritic, from which state it passes into a rock having a base of
compact felspar in parts containing concretions and disseminated
green earth.      It throws off strata of sandstone of about the same
age as those found on the sides of the Wrekin and Caer Caradoc,
and the phenomena resulting from the contact are identical with
those of Shropshire, the sandstone being converted into a hard and
granular quartz rock, having a conchoidal fracture.
    This line of altered rocks runs precisely parallel to the strike of
the strata of the grauwacke series, and is traceable for miles to the
south-west, the most prominent elevation of the quartz rocks being
Cairn-goch, formerly a Roman camp.
    Small metalliferous veins, chiefly of lead, have been found along
this line of eruptive elevation, particularly on the right bank of the
river Sowdde.
    The only lead mines now in work in Caermarthenshire are at

westward of the range of fossiliferous grauwacke, their relations are
analogous to those of the Shelve district, in presenting on one flank
a mountainous wall of highly altered conglomerate and quartz rock
running from north-east to south-west, which forms the chief rider
to those veins, as in the case of the Stiper Stones in Shropshire.
   II. Malvern and Abberley Hills.—The author highly commends
the description of the Malvern Hills published by Mr. Horner in the
Geological Transactions *, and refers to it for a faithful account of
their mineralogical structure. The present memoir dwells more at
length on the effects produced by these sienitic rocks upon the
grauwacke strata among which they have been protruded, and which
have been altered into chloritic and micaceous schists, highly indu
rated grits, &c.; whilst others, although unaltered, have been thrown
into an inverted position, as pointed out upon a former occasiont.
   The author points out the existence of certain bosses of sienite
and greenstone in Cowley park to the north of the main chain.
He then proceeds to indicate the various points at which masses of
eruptive rock hitherto unnoticed appear at the surface in the north
ern prolongation of the direction of these hills, and connect the
Malvern with the Abberley Hills. These are the hills of Berrow,
Woodbury and Abberley. They are                                     all
                                                      rounded forms, and  of                                   so
covered with vegetation that their structure can only              ascertained             be

     Clee hills.-The basalt of the Titterstone and Brown Clee Hills
 having been described, the author only refers to his former com
 munications for the purpose of stating, that Mr. Lewis of Knowlbury
 has proved the existence of an eruptive wall of basalt which cuts off
 the coal of the Treen pits, precisely in the linear direction of that
 which has been called the Jewstone (basaltic) fault. The coal in the
 proximity of the basalt is much altered and of no value.
     Wenlock and Coalbrook Dale.—The greenstones and amygdaloids
 which rise up at various points through the carboniferous limestone
 and coal measures of this tract, are marked by the author on the
 Ordnance map, but he suggests that their chief interest will be ap
 parent when the survey of                           all

   The London clay, for the first thirty feet, was of a loose texture,
reddish brown colour, and contained a good deal of iron pyrites
and selenite : for the next hundred and seventy feet it varied in
colour from blue to dark brown, and contained many septaria; and
the lower part was very sandy.       At the depth of 260 feet a few
fruits and seeds were procured,—the former resembling those
found at Sheppey, and the latter those found at Highgate; but
between 265 and 285 feet the clay abounded with vegetable re
mains. A classed list is given of the fossils obtained by the author;
and among those not previously noticed, he mentions the remains of
Asterias, a Pentacrinite, six species of bivalves, and two small,
straight, tubular bodies, one round, the other square, having an in
ternal radiated structure like that of a Belemnite, but without a
central cavity.
   The rock between the London and plastic clays was full of green
particles, and contained numerous rounded flint-pebbles.          The
fossils obtained from it were chalky and friable, and among them
the author found Mya intermedia and Natica glaucinoides, shells
characteristic of the Bognor rock.
                                                                                                                   no

Helix hispida, the synonyms of two distinct species are in the “Irish
Testacea" again appropriated to one. These are the Helic planata
of Maton and Rackett and the H. carinata of Montagu, and as these
have not severally been given in any catalogue of the shells of Ire
land, and my cabinet contains specimens of both species collected
there, one or other, the Planorbis lutescens of Lamarck, or P. cari
natus of Draparnaud (to adopt modern names), remains now to be
added.—Walvata Planorbis, Drap.
   A beautiful species of Limneus, collected in the South of Ireland
by William Henry Harvey, Esq., of Limerick, and presumed to be
new to science, was also characterised by Mr. Thompson.         It ap
proximates, the L. glutinosus more nearly than any other British
species of this genus.

   I. Places of the periodic Comet of 67 years, or Comet of Biela,
deduced from the Observations of Sir John Herschel at Slough,
and of Mr. Henderson at the Cape of Good Hope. By Mr. Hen
derson.
   The positions of the stars with which the comet was compared
were obtained partly from the catalogues of MM. Pond and Bessel,
but chiefly from observations made at the Cape Observatory.
Founded on these determinations, there are given—the comet's
apparent geocentric right ascension and declination on September
23rd and 24th, and November 3rd and 4th, 1832, deduced from Sir
John Herschel's observations—and on November 18th, 22nd, 23rd,
and 27th, December 26th and 31st, 1832, and January 1st, 2nd, and
3rd, 1833, deduced from the observations of Mr. Henderson.
   II. Various Observations made at the Observatory, Cape of Good
Hope, in April and May 1833. Communicated by Mr. Henderson.
   1. Observed Transits of the Moon and Moon-culminating Stars.
By Lieut. W. Meadows, R.N.
   2. Observations of the Moon and Stars made with the Mural
Circle, on April 29th, 1833.
   3. Observation of a Lunar Occultation of m Geminorum, made on
April 24th, 1833.
   This additional series of observations made at the Cape Observa
tory by Messrs. Henderson and Meadows, is a continuation of those
already communicated.      (See Monthly Notice for June 1833.)
   III. Results of a comparison of various Observations of Mars made
at Cambridge, Greenwich, and the Cape of Good Hope, for the de
termination of the Sun's Parallax. By T. Henderson, Esq. In a
Letter to Professor Airy, dated Nov. 11th, 1833.
   Mr. Henderson has compared various observations made at Cam
bridge, and at Greenwich with both circles, with his own made at
the Cape of Good Hope; and has deduced the correction of the
declination of Mars, as given in the Berlin Ephemeris. The results

     “The chief inference,” Mr. Henderson remarks, “to be drawn
from the above observations appears        be, the probable accuracy
                                                                  to

   Mr. Henderson states that the season       which these observations   in
were made was not favourable for delicate astronomical observations
at the Cape,     the south-east wind was generally prevalent, during
                       as

   These positions have been computed by Mr. Henderson from the
observations, and he has compared them with those interpolated
from Mr. Encke's accurate Ephemeris, communicated to the Society
in May 1832.     Mr. Henderson considers, as a definitive result ob
tained from the Cape observations, that the mean correction of the
ephemeris in right ascension is +2'25" reduced to a great circle,
and in declination + 1' 30", the mean corresponding date being
June 5, 1832.

Greenwich, from February 1833 to March 1834.            .
   June 13.—The following communications were read:
   I. Some remarks on the Greenwich mural circles, by the Astro
nomer Royal.
   The memoir lately published by Professor Airy, in which he
notices some discordances in the zenith points of the Cambridge
circle as determined by different stars observed directly and by re
flection, induced Mr. Pond to examine whether one or both the
mural circles of Greenwich exhibited the same defects. The ob
servations of 1825 and 1826 being very numerous and carefully
made, Mr. Pond has selected a series of differences of declinations
between certain stars observed in those years. As the altitude of
each star is obtained with each circle by direct and reflected vision,
independently, (the stars being in fact observed as church steeples
are with a théodolite,) it is evident that there are four combinations
of differences between every pair of stars, wholly free from any
hypothesis as to the absolute declinations, the agreement or dis
agreement of which will show the accuracy or defects of the           in
struments.       From the near coincidence of each result with the
mean, Mr. Pond concludes that the circles were at that time in a
satisfactory state.
    II. Observations of the Solar Eclipse, July 16, 1833, at the
 Cambridge Observatory.        By Professor Airy.
    Professor Airy considers the beginning or end of a solar eclipse
so unsatisfactory an observation compared with the mode adopted
by him on the present occasion, that he did not think it worth
while to note them at all. The instrument employed was a 5-feet
equatorial by T. Jones, magnifying power 100, which has been
noticed in the determination of the elongations of Jupiter's fourth
satellite and of the parallax of Mars. The only sensible error in
 its adjustment was that        azimuth, which was unimportant
                               in                                in  the
present instance,    as the middle  ofthe eclipse was almost exactly   at
6" from the meridian. The observations were of differences of
 N.P.D. and differences        of                            N.P.D.,

 of two cusps, were observed, the instrument was clamped in R.A.,
and one of the micrometer wires (this instrument has two), the posi
 tion of which was previously read off, was brought upon the cusp
by the tangent screw of the declination circle, as the cusp passed
 the centre wire; and the time was noted. The second cusp was
bisected by the second micrometer wire when it passed the centre
wire, the time being also noted and the micrometer read off after
the observation was made. The subjects registered in this observa
 tion are the clock times of the passages of the cusps, and the read
 ings of the two micrometers when the wires were placed upon each.
 The differences of R.A. were obtained by observing the transits of
 each cusp over                       all
                        five wires when the interval allowed, and            other                                 in

N.P.D., and semidiameters of the sun and moon.              The solution of
these equations, on the supposition that the place of the sun in the
Berlin Ephemeris is correct, shows that the true R.A. of the moon
at the time of the eclipse is less than that of the Berlin Ephemeris
by 19":30, and less than that of the Nautical Almanac by 18":55,
while the true north declination is less than that of the Berlin
Ephemeris by 1"-26, and less than that of the Nautical Almanac
by 1"-21.     These are the corrections which ought to be applied to
the tabular values of the moon's place in deducing longitudes, &c.,
from observations of this eclipse.
    III. On the position of the ecliptic, as inferred from transit and
circle observations, made at Cambridge Observatory, in the year
1833. By Professor Airy.
    Those observations only were employed in which both limbs
were observed ; giving 140 transit, and 134 circle, observations,
six microscopes being read for each limb in the latter.          The clock
errors were deduced from a catalogue differing from Pond's of 1112
stars by a mean excess of 0°11, and from Bessel's in the Tab. Reg.
by a mean excess of 0°18.
    In the circle observations, the first limb was observed by setting
the instrument approximately, reading the microscopes, and mea
suring the distance of the limb from the fixed wire by a micrometer
wire.     The other limb was observed in the usual way. The re
fractions used were Bessel's, the parallaxes those of the Berliner
Jahrbuch, both applied separately to each limb. The latitude of
the place was derived from 917 observations, with six microscopes,
of 10 circumpolar stars. See Camb. Obs., vol.                  The method          vi.

or we may use the mean errors as the errors for the mean times, and
make our whole calculation one of errors.”
   By grouping the observations for each month, in the manner
above described, Professor Airy deduces from the comparison of
the errors which are given, that his observations (his own catalogue
of stars included) give the sun north of the ecliptic assumed in the
tables, by
           – 1",061       cos G) long. — 0",427 sin G) long. + 0"-487.
   The correction required by the first term is equivalent to a re
duction of 0°18 in the right ascensions of the stars employed, being
the excess above Bessel's right ascensions which Professor Airy's
catalogue assumes; showing that Bessel's place of the equinox is
precisely that deducible from the Cambridge Observations.         “This
accuracy of coincidence,” Professor Airy remarks, “is to a certain
degree accidental; but I do not think that accident would extend
so far as to the difference between Mr. Pond and Bessel.”
   The second term implies that the obliquity is less than that of
the Berliner Jahrbuch by 0".427.
   The third term would imply that the sun moves in a small circle
of latitude 0":487, which increases the apparent obliquity in summer
and diminishes it in winter.     This result, similar to that obtained
from other   circles, is made the occasion of introducing the following
remarks.
   It is found that the difference of N.P.D. of a northern and
southern star observed directly is always less than the same by
reflected observation.    At Cambridge a mean zenith point has been
obtained from northern, zenithal, and southern stars, and subse
quent single observations are corrected by comparing the zenith
points deduced with the mean zenith point. , All stars are thus
corrected, and, by graphical interpolation, the sun and planets
also ; and the result is confirmatory of the method, since without it
the discordance of obliquities would have amounted to five seconds.
On the actual discrepancy in question, Professor Airy observes,
1st, that an error of less than O'''25 in the correction of the circum
polar stars and the sun would entirely remove                         it;
                                                       2nd, that we are
not   justified  positively asserting the mean                    of
                                                    direct and reflected
observations       toin

      V.   On the Mural Circle            of    the Observatory       at   the Cape   of   Good

   Mr. Henderson has here detailed the experiments and investi
gations which he made for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of
the anomalies which had been observed in the Cape mural circle,
and of detecting the laws by which they are regulated.     A similar
inquiry by Mr. Sheepshanks and Professor Airy has been already
published in Vol. V. of the Society's Memoirs.
   The experiments on which Mr. Henderson grounds his investi
gations are a series of readings at each fifth degree of the limb of
the instrument made with each of the six microscopes.       The dis
crepancies among the readings indicate that the figure of the limb
is that of an oval of small excentricity, and that the centre of
motion frequently changes          position.       its

   itherto made, and the astronomical observations confirm this esti
 mate.
     Mr. Henderson next investigates the extent of the changes in
 the position of the centre of motion, and the formulae for repre
 senting them. It appears, that from an unsteadiness in the support
 of one of the pivots of the axis, the centre frequently changes its
 position by irregular quantities; and that, owing to the non-circular
 figures of the pivots, other changes in the position of the centre of
 motion take place while the circle revolves on                axis.     Formulae   its
 for expressing the variations occasioned                                by

 given, which are constant for the same positions              the circle. But      of

 variation of the daily motion brought the two results much nearer;
 but a difference still remains between the observed times of perihe
 lion passage in 1826 and 1832, such as would arise from a resisting
 medium.      Towards ascertaining this point, M. Santini has recom
 puted the perturbations caused by Jupiter with the values of the
 mass given by Laplace and by Professor Airy. Some of the results
 are given in the Monthly Notices.

steady the whole time. The diminution of light by Nicod's photo
 meter was almost insensible, though perfectly appreciable by the
naked eye, and though two thirds of the sun's disc was eclipsed.
With a power of 135, the lunar mountains were distinctly visible.

    June 10. A collection of objects of Zoology, made by Lieut. Allen,
R.N., Corr. Memb. Z. S., during his late expedition up the Quorra into
the interior of Africa, and presented by him to the Society, was exhi
bited. It was accompanied by another collection formed by the same
gentleman at Fernando Po. They comprehended a previously un
described species of Plover; an undescribed Tetrodon and a Myletes;
specimens of Polypterus Senegalus, Cuv., and of a Gymnarchus, Ej. ;
and specimens of the three horned Chama:leon,                  Chama:leo Oweni,
Gray, and of a Galago, Galago Senegalensis, Geoff. ; the two latter
being from Fernando Po. They also included numerous Insects and
Arachnida, both from the interior and from the island.
    The bird was characterized by Mr. Gould as Vanellus albiceps.
Between the eye and the upper mandible is situated a fleshy sub
stance (resembling that of the common Cock) which hangs down at
right angles with the beak; it is of an orange colour, and is narrow

to be less than two yards long).        The other end is then to be taken
out of the ground and attached to the apparatus for experiment.
The wire is again slided up to the wired string, and left there during
the time the experiments are carrying on.
    The only method of getting the kite down during an intense
electrization of the string, with safety to the experimenter, is to
unfasten the silken cord from                     its
                                       hold and let                    all
                                                         go: the kite falls.

 however visible to thenaked eye. These stellate crystals, varying from
 1% to 2 lines in extreme diameter, continued to fall for nearly half
 an hour, and as they retained their form for a considerable time,
 proved highly interesting and attractive.        I much regretted that I
 was so circumstanced as to be unable to ascertain the state of the
 barometer and thermometer; the wind, however, was northerly with
 a point of east.     Snow continued to fall until the coach reached

 was remarkably fine,         observed that it had fallen there in every

      § 1. Microscopic Appearances with          Polarized Light.
                the very numerous attempts which have been
AMONG made of late years to improve the microscope, I am not
aware that it has yet been proposed to illuminate the objects
with polarized light.
   But as such an idea is sufficiently simple and obvious, it is
possible that some experiments of this kind may have been
published, although I am not acquainted with them.               I have
lately made this branch of optics a subject of inquiry, and
I have found it so rich in beautiful results as entirely to sur
pass my expectations.
   As little else is requisite to repeat the experiments which
I  am about to mention than the possession of a good micro
scope,  I                                     I
           think that in describing them shall render a service
to that numerous class of inquirers into nature, who are de
sirous of witnessing some of the most brilliant of optical phae
nomena without the embarrassment of having to manage any
large or complicated apparatus. And it cannot be without             in
terest for the physiologist and natural historian to present him
with a method of microscopic inquiry, which exhibits objects
in so peculiar a manner that nothing resembling it can be
produced by any arrangements of the ordinary kind.
    In order to view objects by polarized light,          I  place upon

   causes in a short time a deposition of minute crystals in the
   form of rhomboids, exquisitely perfect in shape and transpa
   rency, and of every variety of size.
      When these miniature crystals are placed on the stage of
   the microscope, the field of view remaining dark as before,
   we see a most interesting phaenomenon; for as every crystal
   differs from the rest in thickness, it displays in consequence a
   different tint, and the field of view appears scattered with the
   most brilliant assemblage of rubies, topazes, emeralds, and
   other highly coloured gems, affording one of the most pleas
   ing sights that can be imagined. The darkness of the ground
  upon which they display themselves greatly enhances the
   effect.     Each crystal is uniform in colour over                  surface,                      all   its

capricious manner, as to baffle description, and with care it is
often possible to detect five or six different shades of colour
upon some of the very smallest of the crystalline fragments.
These miniature phaenomena are often highly curious. Upon
one occasion a solution of some salt was precipitated by                                     al
cohol in very minute crystals. When the alcohol began to
evaporate, it caused currents in the liquid, which carried the
crystals across the field of view, and at the same time caused
them to revolve round their centres.
    The crystals, which were highly luminous in one position,
when their axes were in the proper direction for depolarizing
the light, became entirely dark in the opposite position, thus,
as they rapidly moved onwards, appearing by turns luminous
and obscure, and resembling in miniature the coruscations of
a firefly.     It was impossible to view this without admiring the
infinite   perfection    of nature, that such almost imperceptible
atoms should be found to have a regular structure capable of
acting upon light in the same manner as the largest masses,
and that the element of light itself should obey in such trivial
particulars the same laws which regulate                 course throughits
out the universe.

ment. A drop of saturated solution of sulphate of copper was
precipitated by ammonia. The precipitate was again dissolved
by more of the alkali, taking care to add no more than was
requisite for that purpose. Some strong aceticacid was then
added, and the whole stirred together with a glass rod, upon
a plate of glass, which was then laid upon the stage of the mi
croscope.    In about half a minute spontaneous crystallization
took place of a very beautiful salt, which I presume to be the
acetate of ammonia and copper, in rhomboids of a deep blue
colour, and very perfect in shape, insomuch that among
many hundreds of them the microscope detected scarcely any
that had any flaw or defect of transparency.      In shape these
crystals are not unlike those of common sulphate of copper,
but they are distinguished from them by a decisive character,
namely, their deep blue colour, even when of the very smallest
dimensions: for the crystals of sulphate of copper, when of
this degree of minuteness, are perfectly white. Now, when
the incident light is polarized, it causes a singular change in
these crystals; for one half of them become green, the other
half acquiring a purer blue than before. But on turning round
the plate of glass that supports them, the blue ones are seen
to change their tint to green, while the green in their turn
become blue: thus exhibiting the dichroism of which Sir David
 Brewster was the first discoverer; and exhibiting      let                      it,        it   be

  least no instrument that has been proposed has met with ge
 neral approval and adoption.                   I
                                           am persuaded, nevertheless,
  that  light  is capable of accurate measurement, and in various
  ways; and that the difficulties which stand in the way of ob
  taining a convenient and accurate instrument for photometrical
 purposes will ultimately be overcome.
     To begin with the most simple considerations which may
 serve to guide us in reasoning on this subject, I will select
 the experiment well known to every one of whirling round a
 glowing coal, which from                its
                                      rapid motion conveys             the eye          to
 the impression          ofcontinuous fiery circle. The question de
                           a
 serves consideration whether the eye receives from this cir
 cular ring exactly the same quantity            light which
                                                          of          received         it
 from the much smaller surface of the coal                rest.    There can
                                                                   at
 be  no doubt,      as    seems, that such must be the case; for
                         it                                                                        if
 the luminous circle sent more rays               the eye,to      would like  it
 wise send more          inevery other  direction,    and thus the apart
 ment would become more illuminated than before, which                                              is
 not the fact.       If,then, the total quantity        light remains the
                                                                  of
 same,  it   follows that       its
                                 apparent intensity must have dimi
 nished exactly      in the same proportion                       its
                                                        apparent area has
                                                             as
 been    enlarged.      For the sake      more ofaccuracy         we confine  if
 our reasoning       to   avery small portion                 of
                                                     the luminous body,

                                      it       occupyto       evidently pro
                                                                         is
portional     to the circumference             of
                                         the circle       describes; there
                                                                   it
fore the preceding argument alleges that the intensity                    light              of
diminishes     as  the circumference increases. But            the same pro  in
portion   in   which the circumference increases, the time during
 which the coal      is found     any particular point
                                    in                             the circle     of
diminishes.
    The rapidity         of
                          the rotation does not affect the argument.
 For instance,      if the rotation             vertical plane, the time
                                               is   in   a
during which the coal occupies the summit                   the circle, com
                                                                        of

minishes when the circle           grows    larger;   for the time                            of   its
being    so   situated bears the same proportion                  the whole       to
time, that the diameter            the moving body (which
                                      of                                  con               is
stant) bears        to the whole circumference         through      which                          it
moves.        Since, then, these two things—the intensityof light
and the time        ofthe body's remaining         any given part
                                                             in             the              of

piece of doubly refracting spar a small white disk placed upon
a black ground.    We may cause the two images partially to
overlap each other, and thus have a portion common to both.
This portion will be perfectly white; but the remaining por
tions of each image will evidently have exactly one half of
white light.    Their tint will therefore agree with that of the
revolving wheel when one half of it is painted black.
   But by combining two pieces of spar, images may be form
ed of variable intensity, according to the position of the axes
of the spar, and they may either be compared with the gray
papers previously graduated, or directly with the indications
of the revolving wheel. Having thus found the proportion
of white light in the images for any given position of this po
larizing instrument, it may afterwards itself become eminently
employed as a photometer.        The colours hitherto used were
white and black, but in order to verify the results more com
pletely, any two other colours may be chosen, and the mixed
tint arising from their union may be employed instead of the
g raW.
    Having thus considered the appearance of a whirling disk
containing one black sector, I next made the following varia
tion in the apparatus.        I described a great number of con
centric circles, and drew a common diameter to them, and
marked off upon each circumference a number of degrees
(reckoned from the diameter) which diminished regularly
from 360° to 0 as the circles grow larger; i. e. in the smallest
circle I took nearly         all
                           the circumference,         the middle circle
                                                           in
I  took half the circumference, and             the outer circle the arc

spirals, but having only one convolution, and bounded                 the        by
common diameter.
   (See figure 1.)—This spiral figure was painted black, the
rest  of the circle remaining white, and the wheel was then made
to  revolve. The result was          gray surface varying gradually
                                             a

latter.  But the most curious part of this experiment was to
observe the neutral tint, through which the colour passed at a
certain point.  When this neutral tint offered any singularity
that made it desirable to examine it more particularly, it was
easy, by measuring                its
distance from the cen
tre,   tocompute how
much of each colour
 entered into        compo
                     its

find means of dividing the experiment into minute intervals
of time, and we may cause that quality of the body which
we wish to estimate the intensity of to act upon our senses
or upon our instruments, only during a certain number of
those intervals, but regularly and rapidly recurring in a stated
order.

 as to yield a reasonable quantity of gas in the volta-electro
 meter, the battery connexion was broken, the positive elec
 trode removed, and the tube and remaining chloride allowed

   805. Iodide of potassium was subjected to electrolytic action
in a tube, fig. 13. (789.). The negative electrode was a
globule of lead, and I hoped in this way to retain the potas
sium, and obtain results that could be weighed and compared
with the volta-electrometer indication; but the difficulties de
pendent upon the high temperature required, the action upon
the glass, the fusibility of the platina induced by the presence
of the lead, and other circumstances, prevented me from ob
taining such results. The iodide was decomposed with the
evolution of iodine at the anode, and of potassium at the cat
hode, as in former cases.
   806. In some of these experiments several substances were
placed in succession, and decomposed simultaneously by the
same electric current; thus, protochloride of tin, chloride of
lead, and water, were thus acted on at once.               It is needless
to say that the results were      comparable,      the  tin,   lead, chlo
rine, oxygen, and hydrogen evolved being definite in quantity
and electro-chemical equivalents to each other.
   807. Let us turn to another kind of proof of the definite
chemical action of electricity.       If any circumstances could be
supposed to exert an influence over the quantity of the matters
evolved during electrolytic action, one would expect them
to be present when electrodes of different substances, and
possessing very different chemical affinities for the evolving
bodies, were used.       Platina has no power in dilute sulphuric
acid of  combining    with the oxygen at the anode, though the
latter be evolved in the nascent state against               Copper,  it.                  on
the other hand, immediately unites            the oxygen,

                                          can,  without   any   help from

tion which I at first laid down, namely, that the chemical power
of a current of electricity is in direct proportion to the absolute
quantity of electricity which passes (377. 783.).       They prove,
too, that this is not merely true with one substance, as water,
but generally with                     all
                           electrolytic bodies; and, further, that
the results obtained with any one substance               not merely              do
agree amongst themselves, but also with those obtained from
other substances, the whole combining together into one series
of definite electro-chemical actions (505.).         do not mean          I                          to

 But to render this exactness complete, the apparatuses were
required to be made on a larger scale; and, to procure for
the results a perfect freedom from extraneous influences, it
 was also necessary to erect a building entirely free from
IrOn.
   The magnetic observatory stands in an open space about
a hundred paces west of the astronomical one, and forms an
oblong square, placed due north and south, of 32 Paris feet
in length, by 15 in breadth, with two projections on the
longer sides.     Of these the western forms the entrance, and
also serves for certain observations as an extension of the
space within; while the eastern, which is perfectly parted off
from that principal apartment, is appropriated to the watch
man of the observatory. . Everything in the building usually
made of iron, such as locks, hinges, window linings, nails, &c.,
is made here of copper. Drafts are as much as possible pre
vented. The height of the apartment is 10 feet. . The mag
netic apparatus being essentially the same as that alluded
to above, we shall here confine ourselves to merely point
ing out the differences. The magnetic bar is made of Uslar
cast steel, which is particularly      for magnetic observations;

cases of   very   great irregularities in connexion with aurorae
boreales. It is therefore to be expected that, as the participa
tion in these preconcerted observations with this both conve
nient and exact apparatus increases (for which there are al
ready the best prospects), we shall obtain very remarkable and
comprehensive solutions of these very singular and till now
inexplicable phaenomena.
   Similar observations have frequently been made here at other
times also, from which sometimes very striking anomalies have
resulted. Thus, for instance, on the 14th January, in the even
ing between 8 and 9 o'clock, the declination decreased, within a
quarter of an hour, by 13 minutes, with the greatest regularity,
and then gradually returned to          former position.  itsSuch ob

corresponding power             the second, and that induces
                                           in                           motion                    a

                                                in      manner.      About                                  20
feet  of  silked copper wire were made into                 short ring helix,       a
 on  one end          pasteboard tube, through which
                       of      a                                    cylindrical              a
magnet,       an
               inch      diameter,
                               in     could move      freely;   one end      the                       of
helix wire was fastened                small amalgamated copper plate,
                                                to   a
and the other end bent round                      touch this plate perpen
                                                          so   as       to
dicularly upon                 its
                        flat surface, and also           such      manner thatin             a
when the      magnet    was   passed     through    the    cylinder     should                   it
come against this wire, and separate the end from contact
with the plate. The consequence was that whenever this ac
tion was quickly performed, the magneto-electric spark ap
peared        the place
             at                         of
                              disjunction.
   My apparatus was placed horizontally, and                       short loos                a              e
plug  of ofwood was put into the
end       the cylinder,         that the   so
disjunction        the plate should
take place             at at
                    the moment the
end   of  the magnet was passing
through the helix ring, that be
ing the most favourable condi
tion  of the apparatus. The mag
net was driven with           sharp quick motion through the cylin
                                        a
der,   itsimpetus being overcome,              soon       the spark was ob
                                                               as                  as
tained,      by    an
                  obstacle   placed           proper      at
                                                        distance

side  of  the moveable wire.          From the brightness and appear
ance    of   the spark,      have    I    doubt that     no  both ends                  if                 of

horse-shoe magnet were employed, and jogging motion were                     a
communicated           the light frame carrying the helices,
                               to                                        spark                    a
equal,  if   not superior,                     to
                                  those which down             this time have           to
been obtained with magnets                               of
                                            certain power, would
                                                          a                pro                        be
duced.
   Thus the magneto-electric spark has been brought one step
nearer        the exciting magnet. The much more important
             to
matter still remains                      to

the magneto-electric shock. This effect               have felt produced              I
by Mr. William Jenkins in a manner that was new to me; and
as he does not intend to work out the result any further, but
has given me leave, through Mr. Newman, to make it known
to you, I think the sooner it is published the better.                   Mr.
Jenkins's     apparatus    consists of a helix   cylinder   formed of    cop
per wire in the usual manner. An iron rod, about 2 feet long
and half an inch in diameter, can be passed at pleasure into the
centre of this cylinder.        The helix consists of three lengths of
wire, (which, however, might as well be replaced by one thick
 wire,) the similar ends of which are soldered to two thicker
 terminal wires, and on these are soldered also two short cop
 per cylinders, to be held in the hand and give extensive con
 tact. The electro-motor was a single pair of plates, exposing,
 perhaps, 3 square feet of surface on both sides of the zinc
 plate. On holding the two copper handles tightly in the
 hands, previously moistened with brine, and then alternately
 making and breaking the contact of the ends of the helix with
 the electro-motor, there was a considerable electric shock felt in
 the latter case, i.e. on breaking contact, provided the iron
 rod were in the helix; but none either on making or breaking
 contact when the latter was away.
     This effect appears very singular at first, in consequence of
 in to of its
      seeming                            the electricity         single pair

352      Mr. Faraday       on the Magneto-electric Spark and Shock,
 magnet,) the spark, upon breaking contact, is much brighter
 than if the soft iron were away; and because this effect occurs
 at the same moment with the shock in Mr. Jenkins's experi
 ment, it might at first be supposed that the electricity pro
ducing both the spark and the shock was the same, and that
 the effects of both were increased, because of the increase in
power of this their common cause.         But the fact is not so, for
 the  electricity producing  the  spark is passing in one direction,
being that which the zinc plate and acid determine, whilst the
                ºr
electricity producing the shock is circulating in the contrary
 way. See            4-4.
    From the     appearance  of the spark, which is always in this
 form of the experiment due to the electricity which is passing
at the moment when contact is broken, it might seem that a
greater current of electricity is circulating during the time that
 the contact is preserved, whilst the iron is present in the helix,
than when it is away. But this is not the case; for when the
quantity is measured by a very delicate gaivanometer, it is
found to remain unchanged after the removal or replacement
of the iron, and to depend entirely upon the action at the zinc
plate.     Still the appearance of the spark is an evident and
decisive proof, that the electricity which is passing at the mo
ment of disjunction is of greater intensity when the iron is in
the helix than when it is away, and this increased effect is evi
dently dependent, not upon any change in the state of things
at the source of the electricity, but in a change of the powers
of the conducting wire caused by the presence of the soft iron.
I  do not suppose that this change is directly connected with
the magnetizing power of the current over the iron, but is due
rather to the power of the iron after it becomes a magnet, to
react upon the wire; and I have no doubt, though I have
not had time to make the experiment, that a magnet of very
hard steel, of equal force with the soft iron magnet, if put into
the helix in the same direction, would exert an equal influence
over the wire.
     Iwill now notice another circumstance, which has a similar
influence in increasing the intensity of the spark which occurs
when the junction of the circuit is broken.        If a pair of zinc
and copper plates immersed in acid are connected by a short
wire, and       all
                 precautions are taken    to
                                           avoid sources    of
                                                            inaccu
racy, then,      as
                  Ihave already shown, the spark, upon breaking
contact,   is not greater than that upon making contact. But
if  the connecting wire             be
                               much lengthened, then the spark
upon breaking contact        much increased. Thus,

  12 inches in   length   of wire ºth of an inch in diameter gave a
 much smaller spark than 36 feet of the same wire.
     In both these cases, though the long wires gave the larger
 spark, yet it was the short wires which conducted the greatest
 quantity of electricity in a given time; and that was very evi
 dent in the one of small diameter, for the short length be
 came quite hot from the quantity of electricity passing through
                                                                                                               be

      whereas the larger wire remained cold.               Still there can
      doubt that the sparks from the long wires were                  greater                  of
 intensity than those from the short wires, for they passed over
a  greater interval         air; andof       the paradoxical result comes
                                                           so

 source, and passing the same quantity                    electricity      the of                   in

the number of magnetic curves which can exert their induc
tive influence; and the effect in a wire of a hundred feet in
length will be nearly a hundred times greater than in a wire
of the same diameter only a foot in length. The reason why
a core of soft iron produces the same effect as elongation of
the wire, will be that it also brings magnetic curves into                                             in
ductive action exactly in the same direction as those around
the wire; and the rest of the circumstances, as far as can per                        I
ceive, will accord with the cause assumed.
   That the magnetic curves of the wire carrying the current
shall actually affect the character of the current which gives
them origin, need not excite any difficulty, for this branch of
science shows many such cases.         Ampère's experiment of

XLVIII.            On the Mummy Cloth of Egypt, with Observations
     on   some    Manufactures of the Ancients. By JAMES THoMson,
     Esq., F.R.S.*
                                     [With   a    Plate.]
                                           § I.
THE       inquiries which form the subject of the following
      paper were undertaken many years ago: circumstances
which it is unnecessary here to explain have delayed their
publication; but the results were communicated to numerous
individuals.     The revival lately of similar inquiries by others
apparently unacquainted with what is already known, induces
me to believe that this communication may not be wholly
without interest.
   My attention was attracted to the subject of Egyptian ma
nufactures by the late Mr. Belzoni in the year 1822, during
the exhibition of a model of the ancient tomb discovered by
 that enterprising traveller in Egypt.         He had the goodness
to present to me various specimens of cloth, chiefly from the
mummies in his possession, one of which he had entirely de
nuded.
   On my remarking that these fabrics scarcely deserved the
appellation of “fine linen,” which from                          all
                                                  antiquity had been
bestowed          on

Dr. Hadley,         the Philosophical Transactions for the year
                       in
1764, had thrown some doubt                    on
                                        the supposed fineness       this                of
linen,      he
           informed me that during his researches            Egypt,          in              in
those tombs and mummy-pits which                            he
                                                had explored,       had                 he
met with cloth         every

sacking       the finest and most transparent muslin,
                to                                                  fact               a

material they were made. This question had already engaged
the attention              of
                     various inquirers and given birth         learned            to

356          Mr. Thomson             on the Mummy Cloth                  of Egypt;
the mummy cloth of Egypt was cotton; and this opinion, on
their authority, was adopted by the learned of Europe.                    It is
singular that neither in the memoir of Rouelle, nor in the
notes of Larcher, nor in the dissertation of Dr. Forster, in
which this opinion is expressed, are any grounds assigned
for, or any proofs given                     of,
                                      this opinion.       The amount                                    of
their assertion       is,

                                                                                                      I allof

360            Mr. Thomson     on the Mummy Cloth     of Egypt;
close and firm, yet very elastic.           The yarn of both warp and
woof was remarkably even and well spun. The thread of the
warp was double, consisting of two finer threads twisted toge
ther.         The woof   was single.    The warp contained 90 threads
in an inch; the woof, or weft, only 44.           The fineness of these
 materials, estimated after the        manner of cotton yarn, was about
 30 hanks in the pound.
    The subsequent examination of a great variety of mummy
 cloths showed that the disparity between the warp and woof
 belonged to the system of manufacture, and that the warp
generally had twice or thrice, and not seldom four times, the
number of threads in an inch that the woof had : thus, a cloth
 containing 80 threads of warp in the inch, of a fineness about
 24 hanks in the pound, had 40 threads in the woof; another
 with 120 threads of warp of 30 hanks had 40; and a third
 specimen only 30 threads in the woof. These have each re
 spectively double, treble, and quadruple the number of threads
 in the warp that they have in the woof. This structure, so
 different from modern cloth, which has the proportions nearly
 equal, originated, probably, in the difficulty and tediousness of
 getting in the woof when the shuttle was thrown by hand,
 which is the practice in India at the present day, and which
 there are weavers still living, old enough to remember the
 universal practice in this country.
     I have alluded to some specimens of mummy cloth sent to
 this country by the late Mr. Salt.       I am unacquainted with
 their   history  or origin  further than that they were brought
 from   Thebes,    and were contained in the outer packing-case
 of a mummy now in the British Museum. They were evi
 dently the spoils of some other mummy, but when and where

rious fragments of different degrees of fineness; some fringed
at the ends, and some striped at the edges. They merit a
more particular description.
    My first impression on seeing these cloths was that the
finest kinds were muslin, and of Indian manufacture, since we
learn from the “Periplus of the Erythrean Sea,” ascribed to
Arrian, but more probably the work of some Greek mer
chant himself engaged in the trade, that muslins from the
Ganges were an article of export from India to the Arabian
Gulf; but this suspicion of their being cotton was soon removed
by the microscope of Mr. Bauer, which showed that they were
all  without exception linen. Some were thin and transparent,
and       very delicate texture. The finest appeared

 production of the Dacca loom, has only 100 threads in an inch

   the yarns, which, though spun by hand, is not less than 250

 364,      Mr. Thomson     on the Mummy Cloth      of Egypt.
 purpose of making paper. The inquiries, therefore, which
 form the subject of this communication are not affected by any
 question of the integrity of those mummies from whence the
 specimens were derived, of which, however, no doubt is enter
tained.
    The period during which the custom of embalming pre
 vailed in Egypt, embraces a long succession of ages.          From
 the first of the Pharaohs to the last of the Ptolemies, with whom
 this ancient rite is supposed to have become almost extinct,
 chronologists     reckon more than twenty centuries during
 which the art was practised which has handed down to us
these scanty remains of Egyptian industry, the only vestiges
of the labours of the ancient loom now in existence.          They
prove the arts of spinning and weaving flax to have attained
a high degree of perfection, many of the specimens of mummy
cloth here described being of a quality to excite admiration
even at the present day, and the finest of these fabrics ap
proaching in excellence our delicate muslins.          The coloured
borders establish the fact of     indigo   having  been known and
used as a dye in Egypt, from a remote aera.
    During this long period, industry and the arts of life con
nected with civilization must have made considerable pro
gress, which we shall, however, remain unable satisfactorily
to trace till more accurate knowledge of the ancient language
and characters of the Egyptians shall have interpreted the
dates, and fixed the chronology of their monuments and
paintings.      In the tomb of Beni Hassan is a representation
of a loom    (figured  in Count Minutoli's Travels) of such pri
maeval simplicity as to resemble the first rude efforts of savage
art to form a web, such as Don Ulloa in his voyages has de
scribed as used by the native Indians of South America.
Between this loom, and that in which the corslet of Amasis
was woven, mentioned by Herodotus, and more particularly
described by Pliny as a wonderful specimen of manufacturing
art, the distance is immense.
    It is not improbable that future researches directed to this
object may discover, in the ancient sepulchres and mummy
pits, fragments of cloth, now trodden under foot and unheeded
by the traveller, which would throw much light on the inter
esting subject of ancient manufactures.
   The question debated amongst the learned of the nature of
the Byssus of the ancients,     I  may in conclusion be permitted
to observe, appears to me to be finally settled by the present
communication. Herodotus states that the Egyptians wrapped
their dead in cloth of the Byssus.         It has been shown that
without exception every specimen of mummy cloth yet ex

          Mr. Blackburn      on the Modern Telegraphs.              365
amined has proved to be linen.           We owe, therefore, the satis
factory establishment of the fact, that the Byssus of the an
cients was FLAx, to the microscope of Mr. Bauer.

ing the number of signals which can be                made by sema
phores having one arm on a centre;              I now send an investi
gation for finding the signals when the semaphores have any
given number of arms on the same centre.
   Problem.— To find the number of signals which can be
made by a semaphore having any number
of centres; any given number of arms on AC
 each centre; and each arm taking any                                 D
given number of positions.
   Let the figure represent a semaphore
having any number of centres, A, B, &c.,
and any number of arms, AD, AE, &c.,                             E.
on the same centre; let also the number
of centres be denoted by c, the number
of arms by a, and the number of the po
sitions of each arm =
   First, to find the number of signals
which can be made by using the arms on
one centre only.
   The number of positions in which each
arm can be placed may be considered as
distinct quantities capable of a certain
number of combinations.             The number
of positions of each arm    being    p, the num
ber of   signals  which can be made with
one arm only must = p.
   And since the number of combinations of p things, taken
two and two together, is      “ # #,       the number  of signals, using
                            p. p-1
two arms only, will be         1 .. 2

370        Dr. Agassiz's               Observations              on the Growth and on
 there is no difficulty in understanding the symmetrical rela
 tions of the other even and odd series.             We can always re
 cognise differences in the form of the component plates, and
 of the ambulacra of the different pairs, which show evidently
 the appearance of bilateral parity.           These, however, are less
 apparent in the Clypeasters than in the Spatangi.                     Hence
 these data become important for the study of the internal soft
 parts and for the appreciation of their functions.
    It might seem that in passing to the Echini and Asteriae
 (simple or ramified), whose mouth is perfectly central, and
 whose anus, when there is one, is likewise found in the middle,
 but upper part of the body, there would be no further traces
 of this bilateral symmetry, and yet even here it is easy to de
 termine the relations of                      all
                                  the radiated parts and           the longi          of

                                           outwardly,      that we might
 hardly expect           to
                       find      their arrangement                  the bila              of

terambulacral series to another, so that those which lie in a
vertical line one upon another, do not succeed each other in
the order of their first growth.
   The growth of the plates of Echini takes place chiefly at
the upper summit of the shell, and the plates enlarge from the
top towards the bottom until they arrive at the greatest                               cir
cumference of the spheroid, where they become entirely con
solidated: at the lower summit, i. e. around the mouth, the
growth only takes place during the youth of the animal.
Hence arise the differences of form which are observable be
tween the young and the old Echini.              In youth they are com
paratively flat, and become more and more conical as they
advance in age.        In the Starfish the new plates are found in
the  angles  of the radii nearest to the upper surface and lower
surface of the body; and increasing more and more, they keep
carrying to a greater distance the extremity of the radii. Thus,
then, the number of the plates is continually increasing, and
cannot be employed as a specific character.                  Hence we see
how an Echinus or a Starfish receives                 increase, still pre

                  a recent tour through the Highlands of Scot
 DURING land, I  visited the celebrated Falls of Foyers on the
 border of Loch Ness, and there noticed the following phae
 In Omen On.
     Having steadfastly looked for a few seconds at a particular
 part of the cascade, admiring the confluence and decussation
 of the currents forming the liquid drapery of waters, and then
 suddenly directed my eyes to the left, to observe the vertical
face of the sombre age-worn rocks immediately contiguous to
the water-fall,   I saw the rocky surface as if in motion upwards,
and with an     apparent    velocity equal to that of the descending
water, which the moment before had prepared my eyes to
                                                   -
behold this singular deception.
     The cascade is through a depth of about 70 feet, and my
position, as I stood when        I made the observation, was nearly
on a level with the centre of the fall, being the lowest of the
two situations where visitors obtain a view of this copious and
never-failing infusion of peatif gushing over the giant step
and whitening as it flows. My attention was engaged on that
part of the fall which corresponded with a horizontal plane
passing through my eye and the water. The sun was masked
by cloud at the time.
     I am not aware of any existing explanation of this class of
                               I
optical phaenomena, and may be premature in venturing the
following.
    I  conceive the effect to be owing to an involuntary and un
conscious muscular movement of the eyeball, and thus occa
sioning a displacement of the images on the retina.            . . .

they will naturally and even irresistibly tend to follow the
motion of that body; nor can the muscular apparatus of the
eye maintain a stable equilibrium when the sight is fatigued
and bewildered with a rapid change of moving forms before
the eye.

directed to a particular part in a horizontal section of             can                          it,

  LII.    An Account of    some  curious   Facts respecting  Vision.
                                By K
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
 I THINK
      before
                                             I
               the following facts, which, believe, have not been
             observed,  may be sufficiently interesting to find a
place in your Journal.
    About six months since I suffered much from nervous head
aches, which terminated in annaurosis of the left eye.
    For some time after the commencement of the disease,             I
could perceive with the diseased eye, though with some diffi
culty, the letters forming the body of the Philosophical Ma
gazine.
    Most of your readersare probably aware that by an act
of volition it is possible to double the image of an object
viewed by both eyes.       By means of this power I was enabled
readily to transfer the letters of a page of your Magazine, seen
by the left (the diseased) eye, to the right of the page, and to
cause the bottom of a line of the printing seen with that eye,
to coincide with the bottom of a line viewed by the right eye,
and I could thus compare with considerable accuracy the re
lative dimensions of the letters as seen by the diseased eye,
with those viewed by the sound eye.
    To my great surprise I found the letters viewed by the
diseased eye to be just one half the height of those seen by
the right eye.
    The size of the image formed on the retina must be in both
eyes the same, or very nearly the same, the focus of the left
eye being about nine, and that of the right eye ten inches.
    From this experiment we seem necessarily led to the strange
 conclusion that it is not merely by the size of the image
formed on the retina that we judge of the dimensions of ob
jects, but that our perception of magnitude must be referred
to some other source, and that this perception is modified by
the state of the retina.
    I  have now lost the power of seeing any type smaller than
the words “Philosophical Magazine” in your first page, and
 those words I should not be able to read did I not know them.
 It may be necessary to remark, that a very strong light is so
far from assisting my vision, that in the light of the sun
 scarcely a trace of these letters is perceptible.
    That type the letters of which are nearly half an inch high
 I can read, but it appears cloudy and indistinct.          A page of

376      Mr. Sturgeon    on some Magneto-electrical  Experiments.
your Magazine has the appearance of a cloudy surface, the
separation of the lines being scarcely distinguishable.
    If  now I employ convex lenses, I find that by using a lens
of two inches’ focus, I can read your Magazine with perfect
ease, the letters appearing black and distinct.
     I pretend not to offer any explanation of these phaenomena,
but as the facts may be relied upon, their statement may pos
 sibly tend to promote further inquiry on so interesting a sub
ject.     One practical advantage may be drawn from them, viz.
 that where the power of reading is unhappily lost by amaurosis
 of both eyes, it may possibly be restored by the use of a con
 vex lens of about two inches' focus.
     I  may add, that with the diseased eye      I  am able to per
ceive the outline, though not the details, of the objects around

 LIII.     Account of some Magneto-electrical Ea<U+017F>periments made
     with the large Magnet at the Exhibition Room, Adelaide
     street.   By Mr. STURGEoN.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Gentlemen,
                   obtained permission of the proprietors of the
  HAYING Exhibition Room, Adelaide-street and Lowther Arcade,
 to employ their large magnet in any new experiments which
 I  might wish to undertake,     I availed myself of that privilege
 for the first time on Thursday evening the 28th of Augustr
 last. The following results were produced.
     The decomposition of hydriodate of potassa in solution:
 First, by paper moistened in it placed on a platinum plate at
 tached to the negative side of the circuit; and with a platinum
 point connected with the positive side, the upper part of the
 paper was occasionally touched, whilst the magnet was at
 work.       At each touch, however short the interval, iodine was
 evolved at the positive point.
     Second : a solution of the hydriodate and starch was placed
 in a rectangular glass box, with a gauze partition to separate it
 into two compartments. . A platinum plate, properly con
 nected, was placed in each compartment.           In half a minute
 the positive cell was completely obscured by liberated iodine.
 A more striking experiment was never exhibited. Platinum
 wires, properly connected in the circuit, were placed in solu

tion    of acetate of lead:—the                   metal was revived on the negative
WIre.
    Solution of sulphate of copper was also subjected to the
action of the current. Decomposition immediately took place,
and the negative wire became completely covered with copper.
    Water, was also decomposed, the hydrogen and oxygen
being collected in separate tubes.
    The above experiments were made by changing the con
nexions and reversing the current; and the results were ex
hibited with as much promptitude as they could have been by
the employment of a voltaic battery.
    Hard steel was also magnetized by being placed in a heli
cal part of the circuit.       The poles were reversed at pleasure
by changing the connexion.
    A soft iron horse-shoe was magnetized to as high a degree
as by a voltaic battery.
  I   have also made a great variety of electro-magnetic rota
tions, and some other rather novel motions, with electric cur
rents by magnetic excitation, which I intend to publish as
Soon as opportunity permits.
    By publishing the above in the forthcoming Number of
your valuable Magazine you will much oblige
                              Your very obedient servant,

378        Prof. Hare's Apparatus for Freezing Water.
process, in order to obviate the causes of disappointment. It
appeared to me that the failure arose from imperfection in
the vacuum.       An excellent pump, with perfectly airtight
cocks, is indispensable; and not only must the pump be well
made, it must likewise be in good order.          Neither should the
packing of the pistions, the valves, nor the cocks, allow the
slightest leakage.         If
                           a pump has been used previously for
freezing by the evaporization of aether, it will not be compe
tent for the experiment in question, unless it be taken apart
and cleaned.
    Cocks of the ordinary construction are rarely if ever per
fectly airtight, and their imperfection always increases with
 wear.     Under these impressions, having cleansed my air
pump, and put it into the best order possible; for the purpose
of obviating leakage through the cocks associated with the
instrument, I closed the hole in the centre of the air-pump
plate by a screw, and for a receiver made use of a bell glass
with a perforated neck, furnished with a brass cap and a fe
 male screw, by means of which one of my valve cocks was
 attached. A communication between the bell and the cham
bers of my pump was established through the valve cock and
 a flexible lead pipe, in a mode analogous to that already de
 scribed in the account of the valve cock. In this way I suc
 ceeded in preserving the vacuum longer than when the cocks
 of the air-pump were employed in the process, and accom
 plished the congelation of water by means of the vacuum and
 sulphuric acid.
    Latterly,  I have used an apparatus in which a brass cover
 is made to close a large glassjar so as to be quite tight. In ope
 rating, the bottom of the jar was covered with sulphuric acid,
 and another jar with feet, also supplied with acid enough to
 make a stratum half an inch deep on the bottom, was intro
 duced as represented. The bottom of the vessel last men
 tioned was, by means of the feet, kept at such a height above
 the surface of the acid in the outer jar as not to touch                  it.
 Upon the surface          of
                         the glass vessel,   small piece
                                               a             very thin

 hold a   small quantity        of
                             water.
    The brass cover was furnished with three valve cocks, one
 communicating with the air-pump, another with             barometer

  watchman, whom I engaged to supply water at intervals.          At
  a maximum,            I
                  suppose the mass of ice was at times about two
 inches square, and from a quarter to a half an inch thick.
 The gradual introduction of the water, by aid of the funnel
 and valve cock, also of a pipe by which it was conducted to
 the cavity in the sheet brass, enabled me to accumulate a much
 larger mass than                  I
                       could have procured otherwise. A brass
 band  embracing    the inner jar near the brim, with the three
 straps proceeding from        serves    keep this jar
                                                it,           properto                   in   a

   Mr. Gray also exhibited an extensive series of Shells of the Genus
TEREBRA, forming part of his own collection, and illustrating an
account of many new species of that group which he presented.
   He stated that the animal has a small foot, and a very long pro
boscis, at the base of which are seated two very small tentacula; the
operculum is ovate, thin, horny, rounded behind, and rather taper
ing in front. The shell is covered by a verythin, pellucid, horn
coloured periostraca : it is usually white, variously streaked with
brown, the streaks being often interrupted or broken into spots
by the two spiral bands of the shell; one of these bands is placed
near the spiral groove and the other on the middle of the whorl. The
aper of the cavity is frequently filled up by a calcareous deposition;
but this deposition has never been observed in Ter. duplicata.
   The species may be divided into the following sections:
   I. Anfractibus sulco spirali cingulum posterius efformante; labio in
      teriore tenui, concavo.
   Obs. Cingulum in junioribus magis conspicuum; labium internum

 the front of the whorls spotted; and from Ter. tigrina by the mar

    Mr. Gray concluded         stating that specimens               of
                                                               the species
 of Terebra enumerated         him are contained either        his private
 collection or in  the British Museum.
    Mr. Gray also exhibited                  an
                                 extensive series    land and fresh
                                                                of

                         he                       as

    The three following species were discovered        the interior in                of
 New Holland        by
                    Mr. Allan Cunningham, and two          them have      of

 been figured, but not described, in Mr. Griffith's Edition of Cuvier's
  ‘Animal Kingdom.’ viz. HELIX Cunninghami, Gray, in Griff. Anim.
 Kingd., t. 6. f. 4. ; Fraseri, Gray, in Griff. Anim. Kingd., t. 6. f. 6. ;
 and Jacksoniensis (resembles Hel. nitida in form, but is imperforate).
    To Mr. Cunningham Mr. Gray was also indebted for three species
 discovered by him in Phillip's Island, a small island about 5 miles
 South of Norfolk Island. These he characterized as HEL. Campbellii,
  and Phillipii—(this species is allied to the former in the shape of
 the mouth and structure of the lip; but the whorls are angular in
 the young state only, as in most of the Helices of Lamarck,)—and
 CARocoLLA Stoddartii.
    The remaining species were described from specimens in Mr.
 Gray's own collection; they were characterized as BULIMUs rhodo
 stomus, crassilabris, apiculatus (resembles Bul. Kingii, but is more
 solid and has a dark aper and pillar), Pullus, and Burchellii; LIGNUs
 tenuis, HELIX Codringtonii, fidelis, Cracherodii (perhaps a Nanina,
 but is more largely perforated than any of that genus of which Mr.
 Gray has seen the animal), and Maderaspatana.
    While on the subject of Indian Helices, Mr. Gray remarked that
 Hel. ligulata, Fér., Moll., t. 31. f. 2, 3, is a common Indian species;
 and that Hel. cicatricosa, Chemn., vol. ix. t. 109. f. 913, is found in
 the more elevated regions of India, and has lately been described by
 Mr. Lea under the name of Hel. Himalayana.
    Also CARocoLLA Novae Hollandia,          HELIX granifera and pachy
9  astra.
    Mr. Gray observed, when characterizing the last-named shell, that
he calls that a tooth which is solid, and that a plait which is
marked externally by a corresponding groove. Thus the Chondri
of Cuvier have toothed mouths, and the Pupae and Clausiliae
plaited.
    The exhibition was resumed of the new species of Shells contained
in the collection formed by Mr. Cuming, chiefly on the Western
Coast of South America and among the islands of the South Pacific
Ocean. Those brought on the present occasion under the notice of
the Society were accompanied by observations and characters by Mr.
G. B. Sowerby, and comprised the following species of the genus
Pholas, the characters of which are given in the Proceedings.
   “The utmost caution is necessary in the examination and de
scription of the various sorts of Pholades, on account of the extraor
dinary difference in the form of the same species in different stages
of growth. The addition of accessory valves also, as they increase
in age, must be carefully observed, in order to guard against too
implicit a confidence in their number and form. And though I
might be considered guilty of asserting a truism by stating that the
difference in size of different individuals of the same species may
and sometimes does mislead the tyro in the science of Malacology;
lest such difference should mislead the adept also, let him too pro
ceed cautiously, and when he finds a fully grown shell of half an inch
in length agreeing perfectly in proportions and characters with an
other of two inches long,     let
                                him not conclude that     it   distinct

                  OXIDE OF CARIBON FREE FROM CA freo NIC ACID.
         R. MITCHELL     states that he has obtained oxide of carbon of ex
      cellent quality, independently of the use of lime water or any
other agent for the purpose of detaching carbonic acid, by the action of
sulphuric acid on the oxalate of ammonia. The process is as follows:
Take an ounce of the oxalate, reduced to powder, and a drachm or
two of sulphuric acid, and put them into a six-ounce tubulated retort,
and apply a very gentle heat.        In a few minutes large quantities of
gas are evolved, and may be collected in the usual manner over water.
If the heat be duly moderated, the first and last products, as obtained
in the receivers, will be pure carbonic oxide gas.       The sulphuric acid
seems to act by resolving the oxalate into oxalic acid and ammonia;
then to decompose the oxalic acid into           elements, and          put theits                                to

as    form the pure gas. That carbonic acid
        to                                            actually evolved, can           is

gave more of it by evaporation, mixed with some fatty matter which
was separated by aether. The substance dissolved by the alcohol
appears to be similar to that described by Vauquelin.           M. Couerbe
calls it cerebrote.
   Towards the end of the evaporation of the alcohol, a sort of fluid
fat is deposited, which is not the white fatty matter; it dissolves in
aether, and is converted into                       oil

lowish crystals are obtained, of an empyreumatic odour; these are to
be pressed between several folds of filtering paper; they are then to
be redissolved in water, and the boiling solution treated with animal
charcoal.     By these means pure crystals of pyrotartaric acid are
obtained on cooling.
   Pyrotartaric acid obtained by this process has the following pro
perties: It is white, inodorous, very soluble in alcohol, strongly sour
to the taste, like tartaric acid itself. It is fusible at about 212°Fahr.,
it boils at 360° ; and as it decomposes at a temperature a little higher
than this, it is difficult to volatilize it without leaving a residue.
   A concentrated solution of this acid does not render lime, barytes,
or strontia water turbid ; it forms in a solution of acetate of lead a
very abundant white precipitate, insoluble in water, but very soluble
in an excess of acetate; it does not precipitate either neutral acetate
or nitrate of lead. None of the following salts are precipitated by free
pyrotartaric acid: proto- and per-salts of mercury, persulphate of iron,
the salts of lime and barytes, the sulphates of zinc, manganese, and
copper. The neutral pyrotartrate of potash is a deliquescent salt.
Pyrotartaric acid is represented by Cº, Hº, O'; by combining with
bases it loses an atom of water, and becomes C*, H°, O3.—Journal de

ON THE EXISTENCE OF            TITANIUM IN ORGANIC MATTER.             BY

 To the Editors of    the Philosophical   Magazine and Journal of Science.
      Gentlemen,
   Being lately engaged in the chemical examination of the organs of
the human body, I was struck by a peculiar yellow colour which the
salts of the renal capsules afforded when subjected to a red heat, this
colour gradually disappearing as the mass (which was a fused one)
cooled. In order to investigate the cause of this phaenomenon, the
following experiments were made :
    1st. The mass was digested and boiled in water, and the aqueous
solution being decanted, was tested with hydrosulphuret of ammonia,
which, after a few minutes had elapsed, afforded a scanty dark green
precipitate.    I now began to suspect the presence of titanium.
   2nd. That portion of salts which was insoluble in water was di
gested in dilute hydrochloric acid; and the solution being neutralized
by ammonia, and tested with the hydrosulphuret, afforded a copious
dark green precipitate.       A second portion of this acid solution was
tested with infusion of     galls, which produced a reddish brown preci
pitate, care having been taken to neutralize the excess of acid.
   3rd. The matter which was insoluble in water and acid was tested
on platina and charcoal before the blowpipe, and afforded a yellow
transparent bead in the outer flame, which became of a dark purple
colour when heated in the inner flame.
   4th. The green sulphuret, on being exposed to heat, afforded a
white powder; and a similar effect resulted on exposing it for seven
or eight days in the liquor from which it was precipitated.

    Some specimens of renal capsule contain but a small proportion of
alkaline salts, and will not so easily produce the yellow colour which
first attracted my attention, unless an alkaline matter be supplied to
them. I have examined several specimens of the salts contained in
these glands, and have always procured similar precipitates and re
actions, which, when compared side by side with those produced by
titanic acid, show a most unequivocal and perfect resemblance.
    It would appear that these salts contain an alkaline titanate, be
sides a portion of free titanic acid, there not being sufficiency of alkali
              or all
to act on       the acid present.
    In two      three specimens which      have examined the salts have
                                                              I
appeared quite black and carbonaceous            appearance; but fusion      in
with phosphate        soda  of carbonated alkali has always rendered the
                                            or
yellow colour visible. These black ashes exert       alkaline reaction                 an                            on
reddened litmus paper.
    It may       be
                 noticed that the precipitate procured with infusion                                                 of
galls     influenced
         is                      in   its
                            colour, not only    the quantity     acid pre    by                      of
sent, but very materially       the degree  by
                                             concentration              of
                                                              the infusion                      of
 and solution.
   From other experiments lately made,      have reason    believe that I                       to
titanium exists    other structures besides the renal capsules.

LVII.   On Phosphuretted Hydrogen.      By THoMAs GRAHAM,
  F.R.S. Edin.,    Andersonian Professor of Chemistry, and
   Wice-President of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow.”
      EW   substances         have    been the subject of experi
                                             made
     mental inquiry more frequently than the compounds of
phosphorus and hydrogen, and none are so remarkable for
the various and conflicting results which they have presented
to chemists of the greatest acuteness and practical skill. The
obscurity which long hung over the subject has been dis
pelled, however, in a great measure, by the recent investiga
tions of Henry Rose, of Berlin +. Although baffled in his early
inquiries, that philosopher returned again and again to the
subject, and at last succeeded in determining the chemical
functions and true constitution of phosphuretted hydrogen.
He has shown it to be analogous to ammonia in chemical
character and composition. But hitherto two compounds of
phosphorus and hydrogen had generally been admitted to
exist, which were believed to differ in composition as they do
in properties, one being spontaneously inflammable in atmo
spheric air, and the other not so.       Rose establishes beyond
all doubt that these gases are essentially     the same composi

              the same   specific gravity;  and, indeed, that they
are  mutually   convertible, each into the    other, without any

 addition or subtraction of matter that could be perceived. In
 explanation of their possession of different properties, under
 the same composition, allusion is made by Rose to isomerism,
 or the doctrine that two bodies may exist identical in compo
 sition, but differing in properties. Certainly the existence of
 two gases constituted alike, and yet possessing different                              pro
 perties, if established, would afford a firm basis for this                            doc
 trine.
      Itwas the importance of the theoretical results which might
  be looked for, that induced me to attempt to continue the                              in
 vestigation beyond the point to which it has been carried by
  Rose.    Holding the general doctrine of isomerism as proble
 matical, my inquiries were directed to the discovery, in one or
 other of the gases, of some adventitious matter, to the presence
 of which the peculiarities of the species might be attributed.
    It is to be understood that the spontaneously inflammable
 gas made use of in my experiments was prepared by the
 well-known process of heating phosphorus, lime, and water
 together. This gas is spoken of as “the self-accendible gas,”
 or as “the gas from phosphuret of lime.” The other gas,
 which is not spontaneously inflammable, was prepared by
  heating hydrated phosphorous acid, or by allowing the pre
 ceding species, contained in low receivers, to stand over water
 for twenty-four hours. It is described as “the non-accendible
 gas,” “the gas from phosphorous acid.” The accendibility
 of the gas was judged of by allowing it to escape in bubbles
 into the air from the receiver containing                      it,
                                                   over either water
 or  mercury. The experiments were                        all
                                               made when the tem
 perature       of
              the atmosphere was between 60° and 70° Fahr.

           the process           by
                            which the self-accendible gas         pro              is
 cured, free phosphorus distils over,         which       of
                                                          trace     the   a         in

 some time.     Hence the idea has generally presented itself
 that the free and highly accendible phosphorus present may
 be  the cause        of
                    the spontaneous inflammability           the gas.         of
Dr. Dalton, who            all
                        along maintained the opinion, which has
finally been established               by
                                Rose, that the two gases are                             of
the same    composition,  was     the habit in   referring the spon

of one volume phosphuretted hydrogen, and one thousand
volumes, or any smaller proportion whatever, of air, sticks of
phosphorus remain unaffected, but the phosphuretted hydro

of one volume phosphuretted hydrogen and two thousand air,
phosphorus smoked strongly for some time, but at a certain
period the action ceased, and long before the oxygen of the air
was exhausted. A minute proportion of phosphuretted hydro
       in is,

              act     this  respect

     2. The self-accendible gas procured from phosphorus, water,
 and    lime,    is always mixed with free hydrogen, varying in
  quantity from 25 to 50 per cent., while the non-accendible
 gas from phosphorous acid contains no hydrogen gas, but is
 pure. Rose concludes, that the spontaneous inflammability
 of the first species cannot depend upon this hydrogen, for
 the other species is not made self-accendible by the addition
 to it of any proportion of free hydrogen.                On trying the ex
 periment, however, I obtained a different result. A quantity
 of gas had lost                     its
                             self-accendibility         standing over water   by

some   experiments   were made upon the effect of other gases
than hydrogen upon phosphuretted hydrogen. None, with the
exception of sulphuretted hydrogen, (evolved by the action of
sulphuric acid on sulphuret of iron, and which, therefore, con
tains free hydrogen,) appeared to favour the accendibility of
the gas.    On the contrary, the addition of     others, and even            all
of  hydrogen and sulphuretted hydrogen themselves above                                                 a

  in five minutes, so that the gas ceased to be self-accendible.
  Charcoal which had been drenched in water was without
 effect upon the gas.       On heating the charcoal saturated with
 gas in a retort filled with water, phosphuretted hydrogen was
 given off, which, however, was not self-accendible; and all
 my attempts failed to isolate the peculiar principle by sepa
 rating it from the charcoal.        It was quite clear that the pecu
 liar  principle   formed but a  very   small proportion of the phos
 phuretted hydrogen, evidently much less than one per cent.
 of the bulk of the gas. Spongy platinum introduced into the
 gas did not exercise any sensible absorbent effect, and no
 quantity of it seemed sufficient to withdraw the peculiar prin
 ciple from a small bulk of phosphuretted hydrogen.              Stucco,
 likewise, was without effect upon the gas, at least when access
 of air was guarded against at the same time. But both of
 these substances are known to possess a very low absorbent
 power.

 mercury, the inside of which has been moistened by a solu

reaction appears to take place. But the addition of a single
bubble of this mixture, not exceeding one tenth of an inch in
volume, to five or six cubic inches of phosphuretted hydrogen
will render the whole highly accendible, so that every bubble
passed into the air will take fire.
   (3.) In the last arrangement a drop of the strongest nitric
acid may be substituted for the nitrous acid, in the prepara
tion of the impregnating mixture.      The nitric acid acts on
the mercury, and nitric oxide charged with nitrous acid va
pour is collected, which may be diluted with hydrogen as
above.
   The preceding processes uniformly afford a nitrous im
pregnating mixture which may be depended upon; but when
the experiment is attempted over water, there is not the same
certainty of the impregnation being successful.        I
                                                    have often,
however, made hydrogen highly suitable for the purpose, by
passing it through a column of fluid composed of nitric acid
recently diluted with water, provided that the acid had been
fuming from the presence of nitrous acid; or by passing hy
drogen through recently diluted sulphuric acid, as has already
been stated.
     In regard tothe proper proportion of nitrous acid vapour
to the phosphuretted hydrogen,       am satisfied that the pro
                                        I
portion most efficacious is somewhere between one part           ni
trous acid to one thousand, and one to ten thousand phos
phuretted hydrogen.      One nitrous acid to one hundred gas,
or less gas, is never accendible, but becomes so on diluting it
with enough of phosphuretted hydrogen.
     Iwas anxious to discover how far nitric oxide interferes in
the  phaenomena.      The nitrous acid is never free from, but is
always accompanied with, a certain proportion of this gas.
   9. Action of Nitric Oride.—In a table formerly given (p. 405.),
nitric oxide is set down as preventing the accendibility of the
good gas from phosphuret of lime, when the proportion of the
first is so great as one tenth of the whole mixture. In fact, the
best inflammable gas when mixed with nitric oxide in quan
tity from two volumes to one tenth of a volume, exhibited no
symptom of spontaneous inflammability.            The nitric oxide
forms red fumes when the mixture meets the air, but the
phosphuretted hydrogen does not even smoke; so that the
oxidation of the nitric oxide has not a kindling effect upon
the phosphuretted hydrogen, but the very reverse.            A mix
ture of one volume nitric oxide with twenty volumes of good
phosphuretted hydrogen (self-accendible per          se)   still self
                                                           is
accendible; the bubble, however, does not take fire the instant
it bursts  in the air, but after rising     little height, and then
                                            to

it explodes with a puff, like loose grains of gunpowder, and not
with the usual snap, the oxidation of the nitric oxide pre
ceding by a sensible interval the oxidation of the phosphu
retted hydrogen.    Nitric oxide in a considerably smaller pro
portion than goth of a volume exhibits a sensible effect in re
tarding the combustion of self-accendible gas, but does not al
together prevent            it.

drogen, it is from the nitrous acid which it occasionally contains
It is certainly not a little curious that nitric oxide is not equi
valent to nitrous acid in producing the change in question
upon phosphuretted hydrogen, seeing that the nitric oxide
passes immediately into nitrous acid upon meeting air.
Whether the negative influence of nitric oxide upon really
accendible gas is sufficient to account for this anomaly, I am
doubtful.       It may be thought that nitrous acid and phosphu
retted   hydrogen      when in contact for a short time, react upon
each other, with the production of some entirely new and
highly accendible body. But this supposition seems not to
quadrate with the fact that the impregnating mixture requires to
be diluted by so large a proportion of phosphuretted hydrogen
before the whole becomes spontaneously inflammable; nor
is it supported by any visible signs of reaction between the
nitrous acid and phosphuretted hydrogen. Indeed, nitrous acid
vapour appears to be compatible with phosphuretted hydrogen to
an extent which could not have been anticipated. Again, that
nitrous acid, or at least some acid compound of nitrogen, con
tinues to exist in what we may now call nitrous phosphuretted
hydrogen gas, appears to be corroborated by the properties
which this self-accendible gas is found to possess.

   In conclusion, the statement of the above properties is
abundantly sufficient to prove that a strong analogy subsists
between our nitrous phosphuretted hydrogen and the self
accendible gas which has been so long in the hands of che
mists.  The peculiar principle of the last, therefore, may be
an  oxygenated body.    That principle cannot be nitrous acid,
but it may be a compound of phosphorus and oxygen (P)
analogous to nitrous acid. In    the reactions   which self

   That some oxide of nitrogen, which in the present state of
our knowledge of that class of compounds seems to be the
nitrous acid, is capable of rendering phosphuretted hydrogen
spontaneously inflammable, when that oxide is present to the

geneity     of atoms in the globe,) afford the natural interpreta
tion of the law or formula of the magnetic dip or inclination
deduced by Messrs. Biot and Kraft from data of observation,
viz. that for any given latitude, the tangent of the inclination
is to the tangent of that latitude as 2: 1.
     If it can thus be shown that the fundamental principle of
terrestrial magnetism is necessarily connected with the path
of an atom, considered in a system homogeneously composed,
then with regard to the various chemical elements or species
of atoms composing the mass of the earth, the greater part
of which do not exhibit the magnetic phaenomena, it would
remain to be examined in what manner, or by what circum
stance, dependent upon the respective values of the two atomic
qualities before mentioned, the atomic paths of the greater
 number are so far modified (from what may be called the
type, preserved in the magnetic elements,) as not to present
the (magnetic) phaenomena in the same sensible way as the
three elements, iron, nickel, and cobalt.
     In connexion with the foregoing investigations would come
 another: whether, in general, the physical and chemical pro
 perties of the several chemical elements or species of atoms
 may not depend upon the respective values of the atomic
 weights and atomic bulks. And here it may be remarked
 with respect to the magnetic elements, and the approximation
 in their values of the two qualities, that besides the circum
 stance of their being magnetic, there are also to be observed
 many marked analogies in their physical and chemical pro
 perties; these analogies being, without doubt, greater than
 what are to be found in the case of any two or more of the
 other chemical elements.

  ON       Saturday evening, (June 14th,) about 8 o'clock, an elec
         tric storm passed partly over this place, exhibiting light
 ning the most splendid ever beheld. The wind was pretty brisk
 from S. by W. about the first appearance of the storm, and
  if the electric clouds had obeyed the force of the wind only,
  the principal part of them would have come directly over us.
  This, however, was not the case, for instead of their being

                      a Thunder-storm as observed at Woolwich.                                                               4,   19
carried over Woolwich in the direction of the wind, the most
formidable group of them, and consequently the greatest fury
of the storm, were deflected out of the wind’s track before
their arrival at Shooter's Hill, and were carried over the low
lands on the other side of the hill, towards the Thames, in a
direction nearly from W.S.W. to E.N.E.
    The deflection of electrized clouds out of the wind's direc
tion, though, perhaps, not much noticed, is a very common
circumstance in the neighbourhood of high lands, especially
if those lands are composed of materials which are bad con
ductors of electricity.   For although they do not absolutely
refuse the transmission of the electric matter driven to the
surface of the hill from the lower strata of air” by the dis
turbing force of the condensed electric fluid in the clouds,
the transfusion into the ground is too tardily performed to
prevent accumulation on the surface, which consequently be
comes charged in the same state as the clouds that are ap
proaching          reaction immediately takes place, and con

420                            Mr. Sturgeon's Description of
sequent  repulsion or deflection of the clouds is produced.
This electric force now operating in conjunction with the
wind, gives the cloud a new direction of motion, and urges it
over a tract of country composed of better conductors, which
are   more susceptible of being transpierced by the electric
matter than those from which the cloud was deflected.
Hence it is that electric storms are more frequent and more
violent over marshy lands, rivers, &c., than over drier and
more elevated tracts of country”.
    These causes operated in a very beautiful manner in giving
direction to the storm on Saturday evening. The principal
group of clouds, as before stated, never reached Shooter's
Hill, but was carried over the low wet lands, on the other
side, to the Thames; and the foremost clouds were taken to
the other side of the river, and over a considerable tract of
the Essex marshes.         At this period another direction was
given to the storm, and the new combination of forces urged
it in the direction of the river, a route which electric storms
visiting this neighbourhood very frequently take.
    Its progress down the river was exceedingly slow, owing,
as    Isuppose, to the wind (though much slackened before this
time) being more directly opposed to             had been floating             it.   I

bition.     I walked to the top of Wellington-street, from which
place I had an exceedingly fine view of the storm, now too
distant to hear even a feeble murmur of those thunders,
which, I am persuaded I may safely affirm, were to the            in
habitants immediately in their vicinity terrible to an unusual
degree.
    It was now 9 o'clock, and the lightning was magnificent
indeed. Nature appeared as if disposed to gratify the utmost
extent of curiosity by an unremitting display of her electrical
elemental fire.
    For about half an hour the storm appeared to be nearly
stationary, hovering over a tract of low land on the Essex
and Kent sides of the Thames, perhaps not far from Purfleet.
The lightning was unusually refulgent; the flashes in rapid
succession,    and discharged in every possible direction that
can be      imagined, and, generally through a longer striking
distance than    I  had ever before noticed. Three or four dis
charges which occurred a little after 9 o'clock, darted through
a horizontal arch of about 50° each; and several of those
which were directed vertically and oblique to the horizon,
shot through 30° or 40°, the fluid being visible in every part
of the circuit.
   If   this lightning was discharged over Purfleet, or there
 abouts, as I   have supposed, it would be about eight miles
             I
from where was standing. Now allowing seven miles to be
 the mean distance of the lightning discharged in a track at
 right angles to the line of sight, the angle of 50° would
 give a chord of nearly six miles and a half for the striking
 distance, or the tract of air through which the lightning tra
 velled visibly at one discharge. The apparently vertical and
 oblique discharges were much nearer in some part of the cir
 cuits than those which shot through the extraordinary hori
 zontal ranges.     The rain, I imagine, was falling in torrents,
 which would greatly facilitate the transmission through long
 striking distances.    Moreover, the inferior density of the air
 in the   regions of the clouds, and the thin aqueous vapours
 which are floating there, tend very much to facilitate the trans
 mission.
     Buildings, trees, and other tall objects are not usually
 struck by lightning before the falling of rain, the dry dense
  air offering too great a resistance to be transpierced from the
  clouds to the ground.
     From the time that the clouds arrived within the influence
  of the Thames, they seemed to travel nearly in       its
                                                         direction;

also became luminous, on their points and edges, over a sur

and reel of the kite-string.   The soldiers thought it about the
size of a musket-ball.    It was exceedingly brilliant, and was
the only one that we noticed.
  I  had no electrometer with me, nor any of the apparatus
with which J perform chemical and magnetical experiments
by atmospheric electricity; hence the whole of the time on
this occasion was devoted to mere observation.
   The following is a notice, extracted from the Lancaster Ga
zette of the 5th of April last, of some experiments made with
an electrical kite at Kirkby Lonsdale, in Westmoreland:—
   On Saturday the 29th of March, I had a very favourable
opportunity of demonstrating experimentally to several of
my friends at Kirkby Lonsdale, who had attended my recent
course of lectures at that place, that an abundance of the elec
tric fluid usually attends hail and snow storms. The wind
was pretty brisk, cold, and from the W. by N. nearly the
whole of the day. There were several hail showers, each of
which, with a simultaneous increase of wind, became a com
plete transient storm.
   During three of these hail-storms,               I
                                                floated one of my
silken electric kites, with a wired string of about 300 yards long,
and insulated in the usual way by means of a silken cord.
   The kite was elevated in each experiment about ten mi
nutes   prior to the arrival of the hail-storm; and the electric
state   of the atmosphere ascertained, which was found to be so
exceedingly feeble that not the slightest spark could be              ob
served.  As, however, the cloud from which the hail was               fall
ing approached the kite, the fluid from the string presented
itself in brilliant sparks to the knuckle; and during the transit
of the cloud, became so abundantly discharged to a wire pre
sented to the string, that it struck in rapid succession through
a stratum of six inches of air; and through three inches of
air, it presented a splendid continuous stream of electric fire.
As the cloud receded from the kite, by advancing in            its
                                                              aérial
course, the electric discharges became less and less brilliant,
and continued      to diminish     splendour and energy with the
                                    in
recession   of  the passing storm,  ultimately vanishing altogether
 bythe emergence        of   the kite from the electric influence    of   the
cloud.
   These appearances were exhibited      each experiment, but
                                               in

into two great classes, namely, those which are decomposable
 by  the electric current, and those which are not. Of the
latter, some are conductors, others non-conductors,            voltaic                       of
electricity”.    The former                           do

abundant source, but having very small intensity.

 posability, upon the nature of their elements only; for, of the
 same two elements, bodies may be formed, of which one shall
belong to one class and another to the other class; but pro
bably on the proportions also (697.).           It is further remark
able, that with very few, if any, exceptions (414*. 691.), these
decomposable bodies are exactly those governed by the re
markable law of conduction I have before described (394.);
for that law does not extend to the many compound fusible
substances that are excluded from this class.                propose to       I
call bodies of  this, the decomposable    class,  Electrolytes  (664.).
    824. Then, again, the substances into which these divide,
under the influence of the electric current, form an exceed
ingly important general class.        They are combining bodies;
are  directly associated with the fundamental parts of the doc
trine of chemical affinity; and have each a definite proportion,
in which they are always evolved during electrolytic action.
I  have proposed to call these bodies generally ions, or parti
cularly anions and cations, according as they appear at the
anode or cathode (665.); and the numbers representing the
proportions in which they are evolved electro-chemical equiva
lents.    Thus hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, iodine, lead, tin,
are  ions;  the three former are anions, the two metals are cat
ions, and 1, 8, 36, 125, 104, 58, are their electro-chemical
                                                   -
equivalents nearly.
    825. A summary of certain points already ascertained re
specting electrolytes, ions, and electro-chemical equivalents, may
be given in the following general form of propositions, with
out, I hope, including any serious error.
   826. i. A single ion, i.e. one not in combination with an
other, will have no tendency to pass to either of the elec
trodes, and will be perfectly indifferent to the passing current,
unless it be itself a compound of more elementary ions, and
so subject to actual decomposition. Upon this fact is founded
much of the proof adduced in favour of the new theory of
electro-chemical decomposition, which                          I
                                               put forth in a former
series of these Researches (518. &c.).
          ii.   one ion         be
                             combined       right proportions (697.)

with another     strongly  opposed               to                its

                                                              in
relations, i.e.      if   an
                        anion              be
                                    combined with         cation, then   a
both will travel, the one      the anode, the other

           Determination of Electro-chemical                            Equivalents.                         427
    835. x. Electro-chemical equivalents are always consistent,
i. e. the same number which represents the equivalent of a sub
stance A when it is separating from a substance B, will also
represent A when separating from a third substance C.
Thus, 8 is the electro-chemical equivalent of oxygen, whether
separating from hydrogen, or tin, or lead; and 103.5 is the
electro-chemical equivalent of lead, whether separating from
oxygen, or chlorine, or iodine.
    886. xi. Electro-chemical equivalents coincide, and are the
same, with ordinary chemical equivalents.
    837. By means of experiment and the preceding proposi
tions, a knowledge of ions and their electro-chemical equiva
lents may be obtained in various ways.
    838. In the first place, they may be determined directly, as
has been done with hydrogen, oxygen, lead, and tin, in the
numerous experiments already quoted.

 (804.), the conclusion may be drawn, that both the iodine and
 tin are ions, and that the proportions in which they combine
 in the fused compound express their electro-chemical equiva
 lents.    Again, with respect to the fused iodide of potassium
 (805.), it is an electrolyte; and the chemical equivalents will
 also be the electro-chemical equivalents.

 bubbles had appeared upon the plate B, but none upon plate A.
 The plates were washed in distilled water, dried, and re
 weighed. Plate B weighed 1483 grains, as before, having
 lost nothing by the direct chemical action of the acid.        Plate A
 weighed 154'65 grains, 8:45 grains of it having been oxidized
 and dissolved during the experiment.
    866. The hydrogen gas was next transferred to a water
 trough and measured; it amounted to 125 cubic inches, the
 temperature being 52°, and the barometer 29.2 inches. This
 quantity, corrected for temperature, pressure, and moisture,
 becomes 12:15453 cubic inches of dry hydrogen at mean tem
perature and pressure: which, increased by one half for the
oxygen that must have gone to the anode, i. e. to the zinc,
gives 18-232 cubic inches as the quantity of oxygen and hy
drogen evolved from the water decomposed by the electric
current. According to the estimate of the weight of the
mixed gas before adopted (791.), this volume is equal to
2-3535544 grains, which therefore is the weight of water de
composed; and this quantity is to 8:45, the quantity of zinc
oxidized, as 9 is to 32-31.      Now taking 9 as the equivalent
number of water, the number 32°5 is given as the equivalent
number of zinc.; a coincidence sufficiently near to show, what
indeed could not but happen, that for an equivalent of zinc
oxidized an equivalent of water must be decomposed”.
    867. But let us observe how the water is decomposed.              It
is electrolyzed,  i. e. is decomposed     voltaically,  and not in the
ordinary manner (as to appearance) of chemical decomposi
tions; for the oxygen appears at the anode and the hydrogen
at the cathode of the decomposing body, and these were in
many parts of the experiment above an inch asunder. Again,
the ordinary chemical affinity was not enough under the cir
cumstances to effect the decomposition of the water, as was
abundantly proved by the inaction on plate B; the voltaic
current was essential.      And to prevent any idea that the che
mical   affinity was almost sufficient to decompose the water,
and that a smaller current of electricity might, under the cir
cumstances, cause the hydrogen to pass to the cathode,           I need
only refer to the results which I have given (807. 813.) to
show that the chemical action at the electrodes has not the
slightest influence over the quantities of water or other sub
stances decomposed between them, but that they are entirely
dependent upon the quantity of electricity which passes.
   868. What, then, follows as a necessary consequence of the
whole experiment? Why, this: that the chemical action upon

 32.31 parts, or one equivalent of zinc, in this simple voltaic
circle, was able to evolve such quantity of electricity in the
form of a current as, passing through water, should decom
pose 9 parts, or one equivalent of that substance: and, con
sidering the definite relations of electricity as developed in
the preceding parts of the present paper, the results prove
that the quantity of electricity which, being naturally asso
ciated with the particles of matter, gives them their combining
power, is able, when thrown into a current, to separate those
particles from their state of combination; or, in other words,
that the electricity which decomposes, and that which is evolved
by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter, are alike.
    869. The harmony which this theory of the definite evolu
tion and the equivalent definite action of electricity introduces
into the associated theories of definite proportions and electro
chemical affinity, is very great. According to                the equiva

     My first object              was the comparison                       of   the illumination in
the dark and bright partsof Newton's rings as in Mr. Potter's
experiments; but here there are several difficulties of no small
magnitude to be encountered: first, we must suppose equal
portions of each dark and bright space, isolated so as to be
come the fair objects of comparison for the intensity of light
they respectively give. In the next place, there is the radical
difficulty in using the apparatus which Mr. Potter so candidly
allows, which arises from the necessity for transferring the
eye from the inclined glasses to the rings alternately. For                                                  all
these difficulties, indeed,       Mr. Potter has justly observed,

there     is       no
              remedy   but  steady  and repeated practice. By this
means, but certainly                       by   no
                                 other, can the eye become suffi

   The results in this last column differ so widely from Mr.
Potter's, that I was led to examine several times over the
whole calculation; but have been able to detect nothing which
can have led to error.     I can therefore merely give my re
sults as they  stand,  and those interested in the subject may
possibly be able to throw some light upon the point by further
examination.
    Iwill only add, that with regard to the undulatory theory,
Mr. Potter’s calculation of the ratio of illumination from that
theory, viz. 1'1538, approaches so much more nearly to agree
ment with my results than he found it to do with his, that
perhaps we shall find the error (as there must be one some
where) will in time show that there is in reality a still more
close accordance between theory and experiment.         Indeed,
I  will add that as Mr. Potter's calculation is founded upon
his estimate of ºth of the incident light being reflected from
glass, so from some trials of my own, (which I do not doubt
are of far inferior accuracy,) I found the proportion more
nearly gºth.     Now this was quite independent of the last ex
periments.    And it is curious, that on calculation with this
number, in the way adopted by Mr. Potter, I find the re
sulting ratio from theory about 1:25, which accords exactly
 with these experiments.
    I made other sets of experiments, as Mr. Potter did, to
compare the illumination from reflection at the surfaces of se
veral different substances, with the view of comparing the re
sults with the expression for such illumination derived from
the undulatory theory.

   In the first instance compared the effects of crown glass
and of a diamond possessing a tolerably good plane surface,
to the area of which that of the glass was carefully equalized:
we have then to find i' (for glass), as before, by Mr. Potter's
formula, and since we here equalize the lights, or make
    =   I',   we have for diamond         i   =      ;   cos

LXIII.             On the Action     of Oralic Acid upon Chloride of So

IT ofis sodium
        not generally known that the decomposition of chloride
                may be  readilyeffectedby the action of oxalic
acid; indeed, it is presumed that the fact is altogether new, as
our best chemical authors make no mention of it.
   That such decomposition does take place may be proved
by several simple experiments: for example, if chloride of
sodium and oxalic acid be distilled with water in a retort,
muriatic acid will pass over; and when
                                                                  to its

   These experiments have not as yet been performed with
minute attention as to the proportions of the acting bodies,
although such investigation is contemplated; but it is con
cluded, that the chlorine of the chloride of sodium obtains
hydrogen from the water of the oxalic acid to evolve muriatic
acid gas, and that the sodium, obtaining       oxygen from the                        its
oxygen          of
            the water, forms soda, which combines with the

    The chloride                of

when heated with oxalic acid, evolving muriatic acid gas, and

vailed also along the drift           which     one was      work,
                                                                 in              no                  at

as observed at a Depth of 500 Yards, at Monk-Wearmouth. 449
   Each of the thermometers belonging to the party was
plunged in the bore-hole A, and the temperature was uni
formly found about 70°, allowance being made for the differ
ence of the graduation of the instruments.
   6. Mr. Wharton now caused excavations to be made in the
floor of the east drift to the depth of about nine inches, and
quickly inserted in each a minimum thermometer, previously
heated to about 75°–80°, and left them for half an hour.      The
temperature of the air near the surface of the floor at each point
was 62° to 63°; that of the loose small coal on the surface 64°
to 67°. It was found upon two trials that at the point D,
nearest the pit, the temperature at this depth was 64°5;
at C, further in, 66°4; at B, six yards from the forehead,
69°4 and 69°-9.     We then chose a point near A, within two
or three yards of the forehead, and sunk the instrument
deeper, so that it was quickly surrounded by the gushing salt
water: when taken up it stood at 71°4.
   7. We next determined to try the temperature of a fresh
face of coal, by picking off a few inches in depth, and placing
the thermometer in contact with the fresh face and its bulb
among the particles which had fallen.      The first rough trial
gave 69°; the next a temperature       continually rising till it
settled at 713°.
   8. In trying again the temperature of the bore-hole A, we
observed that the thermometer fluctuated through a full de
gree, being highest whenever bubbles of gas rose more rapidly
through the water, and lowest when these ceased for a while.
It was also found that this water, notwithstanding the effect of
human bodies, lights, &c., was continually cooling by the cur
rent of air in the drift.  At 2 P.M.     temperature was 69°-7
                                                          its
when air-bubbles rose      abundance,
                                  in   and 69°1 when this was
not the case. Some time later        was again registered 69°-6
                                                 it
and   69°3.
    Finding this        uniformly the case, we returned
                          be
                   A,to                                             the           to

                                                 a
temperature   of the water when bubbles abounded                72°6,   to   be
and 71°-6 and 72° when they ceased.

    11. On these results I beg leave to offer a few remarks.
    The temperature of surfaces of rock exposed in subter
       ranean situations is subject to several modifying causes.
    1. The real interior temperature of the mass;
    2. The local influence of external heating agents, which
      are, respiration of workmen, lights, explosions, and fric
      tion ;
   3. The variable influence of the air which is made to cir
      culate through the passages of the works.
   12. It is evident that the most satisfactory experiments are
those in which the local and variable influences are the least
possible, or else the most easily ascertainable: they cannot be
wholly annihilated.        In the present instance the small extent
of the underground workings is very favourable; they are, in
fact, only just commenced; no horses are yet                  down into   let
the pit; the extrication         of
                                 gas from the fresh coal            abun      is   so
dant   as    compel
            to          the use        of

                                                     is   a
portant     to  overlooked, that the total influence
                 be                                               the ex       of
ternal agents         on
                     temperature       the resultant
                                            is              the heating  of
and cooling agency         ofthe men, lights, currents          fresh air,    of
&c.    If this total  influence,    anyin part     the mine,   of     aug          be

ment the temperature            of
                               the surfaces, the interior      parts   will
 be found colder than the surface, and the contrary.
   Now       the present instance,
            in                           was found that the resultant
                                                it
of the external influences on the surface of the coal was
powerfully refrigerating; for           those parts which were con
                                            in
tinually and had been long exposed             them, the surface tem

                                           few degrees above that
                                                 a                                        of
the air;    inthe parts which had been less exposed, this tem
perature was higher: when fresh surfaces were exposed                                     it
was highest        all, being
                  of                  above that of the air current.
                                      9°   6.
As the workings proceed this great difference will probably
diminish, and then          may
                           it       not possible

discovery    in the physiology of the brain; the first impediment to
 which, he observes, “is in the nature of the inquiry, since extraor
 dinary and contradictory results must be expected from experiment
ing on an organ so fine as that must be which ministers to sensibility
 and motion, and which is subject to change on every impression con
 veyed through the senses.”           Another cause of fallacy is the depend
ence of the brain on the condition of the circulation within it; but
the most frequent source of error is the obscurity which hangs over
the whole subject;                     for
                              although the brain            divided naturally into

expression which, excepting in a very few instances, is transcendental.
But although the length of an arc, considered by itself, cannot be as
signed algebraically, yet it frequently happens that the sum of two or
more arcs   is capable of being  so assigned, and sometimes in a very
simple manner.      The author has found this reduction to take place in
so many   instances,  as to incline him to believe that it may be uni
versally possible, provided the exponent (n) of the ordinate in the
 equation to the curve is a rational quantity of these reductions: he
 gives a great number of examples; but although the processes for
 that purpose are easy, the difficulty consists wholly in finding the
 proper method of treating each individual case. The author hopes to
 lay before the Society, on a future occasion, an account of the prin
 ciples on which this branch of analysis is founded.
      Mr. Faraday's Eighth Series of Experimental Researches in Elec

      June 19.-The reading of Mr. Faraday's Eighth Series of Experi
 mental Researches in Electricity was resumed and concluded.
     This series is devoted to an investigation of the source, character
 and conditions of the electricity of the voltaic instrument, and is di
 vided into five parts. In the first part, simple voltaic circles are con
 sidered ; and at the outset, the great question of “whether the elec
 tricity is due to contact or chemical action ?" is investigated and de
cided by apparently very conclusive evidence in favour of the latter,
 One principal experiment in favour of this decision is the following:
 A plate of zinc and a plate of platina were prepared; one end of each
 of these was put into a vessel containing a little dilute sulphuric acid
or sulpho-nitric acid, and between the other ends was placed a piece
of bibulous paper moistened in a solution of iodide of potassium: the
two plates did not touch each other anywhere, but still the action of
the acid at the one extremity was able to induce the electro-chemical
decomposition of the iodide of potassium at the other. That this de
composition was due to the chemical action of the acid was proved by
removing the latter; for then the decomposition ceased. It was also
further proved by the appearance of the iodine against the platina;
for it went there in consequence of the passage of a current (induced
by the action of the acid) having the opposite direction to that which
the solution of iodide would have produced had it been the only ex
citing body, and had metallic contact been allowed.
    The opposition of the chemical affinities at the two places where
the acid and the solution of the iodide are placed, is shown when the
metal plates are allowed to touch each other in the middle; for then
two opposite electric currents are produced, but that occasioned by
the acid is the stronger. This opposition is further shown in the
manner in which the weaker set of affinities are overcome by the
stronger (that  is,      of
                     those    the iodide and zinc
                                                    by     of
                                                       those    the acid and
zinc); and this dependence and relation       of  the two explains at   once
the value of   metallic contact; for the solution
                                   if               of       of
                                                        iodide    potassium
be   placed between platina and platina, one       of those piecesof   metal
touching the zinc which     is immersed  in   the acid, then the solutionof
    lide does not tend to   throw an    electric current into circulation,

because  it exerts no chemical action in either direction ; and therefore
the powers   active in the acid are more free to act, produce a stronger
current, and effect decomposition more freely.
   The chemical actions at the opposite ends of the metallic arrange
ment are so strongly associated and related, that in the most perfect
form of experiment, action cannot occur at either end without also
taking place at the other extremity to an exactly equivalent amount.
This is considered by the author as the most convincing proof that in
the voltaic pile the chemical and electric action are the same; that                                                     is,

   The view which the author takes               the identity     of electrical and               of
chemical action, leads him                        to

gives, cause that no action take place, unless a current be formed and
the hydrogen be transferred to a distance, whilst the forces circulate
in what is called the electric current. Placing the origin of the cur
rent in the chemical action, which yet could be thus virtually restrained
unless the circuit was completed, the author expected to find a state
of tension in the chemical or electrical forces before metallic contact
was made or the circuit perfect, and was able at last to prove this most
fully by obtaining an electric spark between two plates of different
metals immersed in acid before they came in contact. This fact, with
the former one of decomposition, fully proved that contact was not
necessary to the production of the electricity in the voltaic pile.
    The second part of this memoir contains an investigation of the fol
lowing important points: namely, whether electrolytes could resist
the action of an electric current if below a certain intensity; whether
 the intensity at which an electric current might cease to act would be
the same for          all
                    bodies; and also whether the electrolytes, when thus
resisting decomposition, would conduct the electricity                     metal

chemical action at one pair of plates cannot pass by another pair ex
cept an equal chemical action take place there; and as the chemical
and electrical action are always equivalent, the equal chemical action
at the second pair will do no more than suffice to transfer forwards the
forces disturbed at the first pair, and can add nothing to their quan
tity : but they can add to their intensity, and in fact the recurrence
of a second chemical action at the second pair of plates has exactly
the same effect as would be produced by a more intense chemical ac
tion at the first pair. In this way it is that numbers of plates give
energy to the voltaic pile, and enable            power       penetrate elec its                  to

DISCOVERY OF SAURIAN BONES IN THE MAGNESIAN CONGLOMF
                           RATE NEAR BRISTOL.
      LTHOUGH some of the earliest noticed Saurian remains were
         the fossil Monitors of Thuringia, discovered in the Continental
 equivalents of our magnesian limestone,—characterized by the same
 testacea and fishes which Mr. Sedgwick has so fully described in our
 own corresponding formations in the North of England,—it does not
 appear that Saurian remains have been until now detected in this
 geological site in our own series.     Recently, however, a quarry of
 the magnesian conglomerate, resting on the highly inclined strata of
 carboniferous limestone, at Durdham Down, near Bristol, has af
 forded some Saurian vertebrae, ribs, femora, and phalanges, together
 with claws, the latter of considerable proportional size: a coracoid
 bone has also been found, approaching very nearly to that of the
 Megalosaurus.       The general character of the bones seems inter
 mediate between those of this genus and the crocodile.       Dr. Riley,
 who submitted the specimens hitherto discovered, to the Literary and
  Philosophical Society of the Bristol Institution, is understood to be
  preparing a detailed account of this interesting discovery for the
  Geological Society.               -
     The only Saurian remain hitherto found in this island in a site
  approaching to this, was a fragment of a lower jaw apparently of a
  Gavial discovered in the lower beds of the new red sandstone at Guy's
  Cliff, Warwickshire. This fact was communicated by Mr. Conybeare
  to Mr. Parkinson, and is noticed in the abridged work of the latter
  on Organic Remains.
  EXPERIMENTS        ON   THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE OF SARSAPARILLA.
                               BY M. POGGIALE.
     M. Palotta, in 1824, announced an active principle in sarsaparilla
  which he called parilline. Soon afterwards M. Folchi thought he
  had discovered a new principle which he named smilacine.         In the

 year 1831, M. Thubeuf stated that he had extracted a new substance
 from sarsaparilla to which he gave the name of salseparine, and last
 ly, M. Batka, a German chemist, towards the end of the year 1833,
 described an acid which he called parillinic acid.            The question to
 be resolved         is,
                   are these four substances four new bodies,            are they                     or
 merely one and the same principle obtained               different methods?      by

Which experiments denote the atom of salseparine to consist of .
carbon 8 atoms, hydrogen 15 atoms, and oxygen 3 atoms. From
these facts M. Poggiale arrives at the following conclusions:        That
M. Palotta discovered the active principle of sarsaparilla; that smila
cine, parillinic acid, and salseparine are identical with the parilline of
M. Palotta, but procured by different methods; that the properties
of these four substances are the same ; and that the pith of sarsapa

          PREPARATION OF CYANURET OF POTASSIUM.
   According to M. Robiquet, when ferrocyanuret of potassium is
calcined in a retort, there are formed cyanuret of potassium and
quadricarburet of iron ; and when the retort is carefully broken, a
certain quantity of perfectly pure fused cyanuret of potassium is ob
tained, which is quite    fit
                          for medicinal use.-Ibid. Sept. 1834.

    We announce with great satisfaction a most important act of
legislation by the Congress of the United States, the authorization
of a geological survey of that fine country, so rich in minerals and
geological phaenomena.        It gives us pleasure also to add that Pre
sident Jackson has committed the execution of this arduous under
taking to Mr. Featherstonhaugh, one of the members of the Geolo
gical Society of London, who has acquired deserved reputation as
a practical and ardent geologist.        This gentleman has been many
years a resident of the United States, and it is of him that Mr. Cony
beare, in his celebrated Report*, says,         “Mr. Featherstonhaugh, a
geologist eminently qualified, from his intimate acquaintance with
 European formations, to advance those comparative views which
demand the principal attention in our science.”
