  I.  On the Satellitary   Nature of Shooting Stars and Aérolites.
             By H. E. STRickLAND, M.A., F.G.S.*
       the truly philosophic work Cosmos, in which the pro
 INfound   Humboldt embodies the results of his life-long studies,
 he expresses some opinions on the subject of shooting stars,
which there appears to me considerable difficulty in adopting.
 If  we assume with him that the observations of Benzenberg
and Brandes on the parallax of shooting stars are correct, it
appears that these bodies have a velocity of from 17 to 36
geographical miles per second, that their elevation above the
earth is from 16 to 140 geographical miles, and their diame
ters from 80 to 2600 feet.           It may further be taken for
granted, that these bodies revolve in orbits according to the
laws of gravitation, that they are ordinarily invisible, but be
come momentarily luminous whenever they plunge into the
earth's atmosphere; and that aerolites are fragments projected
or swept from these asteroids (possibly by the resistance of
the atmosphere), and hurled to the earth by terrestrial attrac
tion.
     Admitting these premises, the next question is to determine
the nature of the orbits in which these mysterious bodies re
volve, and the influences to which they are subjected in their
course.    Humboldt here adopts the opinion first propounded
by Chladni, that shooting stars and meteors are planetary
bodies revolving round the sun in elliptic orbits, and only
rendered visible to us at the nodes, where the orbits of the
earth and of these asteroids intersect. Their number on this
view of the subject must be prodigious, as it is only those
whose orbits happen to traverse the earth's orbit, and which

happen to pass at the moment when the earth is crossing their
node, which can ever be visible to us. How then, let me ask,
is it brought about that these innumerable planetary bodies,
which are so continually entering our atmosphere and passing
within a few miles of the earth, never come in contact with it?
for be it remembered that acrolites are not regarded as being
the shooting stars themselves, but only as fragments left be
hind them in their course.          Can we suppose that our earth,
a   body   of  nearly  8000 miles   diameter,    should be incessantly
forcing            its
                way through showers            these planetary bodies,

earth.     Why then may we not suppose them to be satellites,
revolving rapidly round the earth in orbits more or less ec
centric, and occasionally plunging into the upper regions of
the atmosphere?           It does not follow because these bodies
move with “planetary velocity,” that they must therefore be
planets. The satellites nearest to the bodies of Jupiter and
Saturn revolve round those planets with a velocity of about
ten miles per second, which is not very greatly inferior to that
assigned to some shooting stars; and as the velocities of sa
tellites increase with their proximities, we may well suppose
that satellites revolving within 150 miles of their primary
would have very high velocities. The alleged velocities of
shooting stars accord sufficiently well (allowing for the per
turbations to which the proximity of the earth may give rise)
with Kepler's law, that the squares of the times are propor
tionate to the cubes of the distances.            By applying this law
to the known       velocity   of the  moon,   it results that a satellite
revolving round our earth at 5000 miles from the centre, or
about 1000 miles from the surface, would have a velocity of
about 40 miles per second, which is even greater than that
hitherto assigned to shooting stars.
   We may surely then conceive these bodies to be of the
nature of satellites, having                 all
                                      their elements        adjusted  so                  as   to
ensure perpetual revolution round the earth, into whose at

annual epochs. This has been explained by supposing that
the earth at these periods intersects certain zones or orbital
rings, in which vast numbers of asteroids are constantly re
volving round the sun. On the supposition that these bodies
are satellitary, and not planetary, it is certainly difficult to
account for the fact of their becoming visible in greater num
bers at one season of the year than at another. It is however
conceivable that the luminosity of shooting stars may be
caused by their coming in contact, not with our gaseous at
mosphere, but with an electrical atmosphere, which may ex
tend     far
          beyond the limits      the gaseous one; and
                                                of          may                           it            be
further  conjectured,  that from unknown cosmical causes this
electric atmosphere may        certain points
                                           at      the earth's orbit     in
receive quantitative       qualitative modifications, which may
                                    or
enable    it   those seasons
                at                 illuminate     larger numerical
                                                   to                    a
proportion          of
                the meteoric satellites.
   At these annual epochs the showers          meteors are said     of                                  to
have apparently proceeded during several hours             observa                       of

                                              in

ring cause be temporarily extended to d, then while this con
dition lasts, the meteors revolving in the ring a a would be
rendered visible during their course from e to f, and (the ring
a a remaining always parallel to itself) the meteors would
appear (allowing for the effects of parallax) to proceed from
nearly the same points of the heavens.
   This explanation must however be regarded only as a rude
conjecture to remove an apparent difficulty; and as this dif
ficulty, if a real one, may be equally explained on the planet
ary and satellitary theory of meteors, it need not prevent us
from giving the preference to the latter, if the arguments
which I have adduced in   its           of

appears to be due to two causes; first, the motion considered
would probably be unstable in the part of the fluid behind the
solid; and secondly, a tangential force is called into play by
the sliding of one portion of fluid along another; and this force

   Let us now return to the aether. We know that the trans

light and the direction of the motion of the aether at the point
considered is taken for the plane a z. Now, in consequence
of the motion of the aether, the direction of the light in space
will deviate from the normal to the wave through the angle

V    in the contrary   direction,   as may be very easily shown
(see    Phil. Mag. for February 1846, p. 78). Hence the di
rection of the light coming from a star is the same as that
of a right line drawn from the star, not merely at such a di
stance    from the earth that the motion of the aether is there
insensible, and again close to the surface of the earth, where
the aether may be supposed to move with the earth, but
throughout the whole course of the light; so that a ray of light
will proceed in a straight line even when the aether is in mo
tion, provided the motion be such as to render (a.) an exact
differential.   The orthogonal trajectory represented in fig. 2
of my paper of July, must not be confounded with the path
of a ray of light. In that paper I supposed that the aether
close to the surface of the earth was at rest relatively to the
earth; in fact, the very object of the paper was to get rid of
the apparent necessity of supposing the aether to pass through
the whole atmosphere and through the earth itself. It should
be observed, however, that the phaenomenon of aberration
allows us to suppose that the aether passes through the atmo
sphere and through the earth with any velocity, either con
stant, or varying from point to point, provided only (a.) be an
exact differential.
    P.S.. I take this opportunity of adding a few words on the
subject of Prof. Challis's last communication.         There is no
thing so far as   I can make out in which we      differ, except the
sense in which we use the       expression eaglaining   a phaenome
non from certain causes.        According to my use of the term,
a person would be said to explain a phaenomenon when he has
shown that certain causes being assumed, the phaenomenon
would necessarily follow. In this sense we explain the forma
tion of images in common optics, assuming the properties of
rays.    We are able to show what must be the form, &c. of
the    image.   In this sense Prof. Challis has not explained
aberration by assuming merely the motion of the earth and
the velocity of light, since, for aught that appears from his
reasoning, a star might be displaced through double the angle
through which it is observed to be displaced.        It was for this
reason, that in order to allow that Prof. Challis had explained
aberration, I attached, in a former communication, a peculiar
meaning to the word aberration.

10                  Mr. J. Napier           on Electrical      Endosmose.
     We  may divide the causes which we might conceive con
cerned in the production of aberration into three:—(1), the
motion of the earth; (2), the velocity of light; (3), the change
in the direction of the light coming to the earth. Professor
Challis has shown that a certain apparent displacement of a
star would result from the first two causes; and as this hap
pens to be the whole displacement observed (neglecting a
quantity which may be considered insensible), so that there is
mone left to be attributed to the third cause, he says that he
has explained aberration, assuming merely the first two
causes.    It is evident that the two senses attached to the
words, to explain a phaenomenon, are quite different.                                       Ac
cording to the sense in which I used the words, the explana
tion of the absence of any change in the final direction of the
light would have to be included in any theory which professed
to explain aberration by means of the first two causes only.
In the present communication I have used the words in my
                                                                                       of it;
own sense, for I believe that there is no impropriety in        but
Prof. Challis   may,        pleases,
                               if     he
                                       consider the   object    my
July paper       have been the
                    to           explanation,   not     aberration,             of

but      of

light. Whichever         these results      arrived       be

   The object of this paper is not to define the cause, but to
point out the different conditions of electrical endosmose, and
the important part it plays in electro-chemical investigation.
   The conditions under which electrical endosmose are ob
served, are, that the two metals constituting a battery, or the
two electrodes of a battery, be placed in separate vessels or
divisions of the same vessel; one of the vessels, or partition,
being composed of a material sufficiently close in texture to
prevent the mixture of the two liquids, and porous enough to
allow the electricity to permeate through             The substances       it.
generally used are bladder, parchment, unglazed porcelain,
&c. The last         what is   have generally used
                                       I                  the experi                  in
ments to be detailed.
   The general effects                 of
                             electrical endosmose are,         portion                     a
of  the positive solution  passes   along  with the electric current
into the negative solution, not                             by
                                          electrolytic action,     has                            as
been generally supposed, but                           by
                                       endosmotic action; and this
endosmotic current         confinedis    the direct influence of the
                                                            to
electric current,     facing  the metals composing the electrodes
                             or
or  battery. There are some circumstances             which the posi          in
tive solution gains       quantity, making
                                  in                apparent current        an

proceed.
     Electrical endosmose manifests itself      two ways,       ratherin                    or
is   of
      two  kinds,  which   may     distinguished  be  the measurable             as

allowed to pass until the negative solution was completely
exhausted of copper, which required sixty-four hours, the
 battery not renewed during the experiment. At the end of
 the experiment, the electrodes being again weighed, the posi
 tive had lost 257 grains, the negative had increased 250 grains.
 The positive solution had lost 6 ounces by measure, the mega
tive had gained 4 ounces. The greatest portion of this change
took place within the last ten hours. The 2 ounces lost are
 mostly from evaporation. The positive solution was evapo
rated and crystallized, and there were obtained 905 grains of
sulphate of copper, 95 less than was originally dissolved; but
the partition being saturated with salt may account for a por
tion of the loss. The 500 grains which were originally in the
negative solution would only contain 127 grains of metallic
copper; but there is nearly double of this deposited, showing
 that the salt had been transferred by some means from the
 positive to the negative, in quantity amounting to nearly the
whole of the salt originally dissolved in the positive solution.
     II. 100 grains of sulphate of copper were dissolved in 4
ounces of water and put into each division, in the same man
ner as the last experiment.      The partition in this case was
much closer in texture than the other; the same battery
power was used, and continued till the negative solution was
exhausted, which was nineteen hours. The negative electrode
being weighed, it had increased 34:4 grains; the negative
solution had increased one-fourth of an ounce; the positive
solution had lost three-eighths of an ounce. Comparing this
experiment with the last, there is a great discrepancy, the
only known cause being the closer texture of the diaphragm;
the transfer of the salt is only in the proportion of one-third
that of the former, and the measurable endosmose is still fur
ther out of proportion, being only one-sixteenth; while the
amount of decomposition is only one-seventh of the 500 grains.
The electrodes in both experiments were the same in size.
    The question now suggested itself whether the transfer of
the copper salt from the positive to the negative cell was the
result of endosmose or of electrolysis, corresponding with the
results of the late Professor Daniell and Professor Miller, who
supposed that certain bases underwent electrolytic transfer in
fractional proportions, and that these proportions might vary
according to the texture of the diaphragm, or that kind of
peculiar resistance given to the passage of a current when
passing from one solution to another.
    In order to determine which was the true cause, the nega
tive cell was charged with a weak solution of caustic potash,

the positive being sulphate of copper; gas was freely evolved
from the negative electrode; in a little time the porous dia
phragm facing the electrodes became coated with oxide of
copper, which greatly retarded the current, and made it neces
sary to use a more powerful battery. After twelve hours, the
oxide which had accumulated upon the diaphragm and at the
bottom of the positive cell was carefully collected, washed,
dried, and weighed 7.3 grains. The potash of the positive
solution being neutralized by muriatic acid, had a solution of
chloride of barium added, which gave a precipitate of sulphate
of barytes weighing 26 grains, equal to about 9 grains of sul
phuric acid. From this it appeared that the copper had
passed from the positive to the negative as sulphate of copper,
and therefore not by electrolysis.
    In repeating similar experiments with very dilute alkaline
and earthy salts in the negative cell, I have observed that the
oxide of copper formed being a conductor of electricity, it
often floated between the diaphragm and negative electrode as
a kind of spongy fibre, and conducted the electricity through
it as a solid, constituting            its
                                   extremity     connexion with the

porous partition into the electrode, the result being the reduc
tion    of the oxide       and upon the diaphragm, closing
                            in                                      up               it
with metallic    copper,  similar            to

     touch the diaphragm.          has often surprised me how mi

        a

 current passed four hours. The cyanide solution smelt strongly
of  hydrocyanic acid; the solution was found             contain both  to
 copper and sulphate          potash; the quantities were not de
                                 of

From this it appeared that both the copper and potassium salt
were transferred by endosmose.    The double cyanides of po
 tassium and silver and of potassium and gold were next sub
stituted for the copper in the positive cell with similar results.
 Nitric acid was also substituted for the caustic potash in the
negative cell, with the double cyanides of copper, silver and
gold in the positive, which would give the contrary result of
last experiments, namely, precipitating the metals if trans
ferred by endosmose, but dissolving or holding them in solu
tion if transferred by electrolysis.    In a short time, in each
experiment, the surface of the porous diaphragm facing the
negative electrode became coated with the cyanide of the metal,
which accumulated and dropped to the bottom of the vessel.
At the termination of the experiments the acid solution smelt
strongly of hydrocyanic acid, and contained much nitrate of
potash. With the gold and silver salts, the acid solution had
not the slightest indication of their presence in solution, but
with the copper there was a considerable portion present,
which was owing to the cyanide of that metal being decom
posed by nitric acid; but this experiment being repeated with
the copper cyanide in the positive and sulphuric acid in the
negative, no trace of copper in solution was found in the acid.
   The next experiment was to determine if any portion of the
potassium of the potash salt was transferred by electrolysis;
for this purpose two porous vessels were employed, one filled
with a solution of cyanide of potassium, the other with dilute
nitric acid; these were placed in a glass vessel containing a
solution of nitrate of silver; the positive electrode was placed
in the cyanide of potassium, the negative in the nitric acid.
The cyanide of potassium which passed from the positive cell
to the silver solution in the glass vessel was decomposed, pro
ducing cyanide of silver and nitrate of potash. After twelve
hours, the cyanide of silver formed was carefully collected,
washed and dried; it weighed 65-6 grains; the remaining
silver solution had as much muriatic acid added as precipi
tated the silver. The clear filtered solution was now evapo
rated to dryness and kept for some time at the point of fusion.
There were obtained 28 grains of nitrate of potash, which is
4 grains less than the equivalent of cyanide of silver obtained;
but the nitric acid in the negative cell also contained a little
nitrate of potash and silver, which had passed from the glass
vessel, and will account for this loss.      From these, and a
variety of other experiments of a similar kind with different
salts, I consider that no base of an electrolyte is transferred
by electrolytic action, but that salts being electrolysed are  all

           Mr.   J.   Napier on Electrical Endosmose.          15
transferred more or less from the positive to the negative elec
trodes by endosmose, and that the amount of this varies ac
cording to the texture of the porous diaphragm, the power of
the electric current, and various other modifying circum
stances, which will be apparent as we proceed with the inquiry
into the cause and circumstances of electrical endosmose.
    In referring to the first experiment, it was observed that the
greatest amount of measurable endosmose took place during
the last ten hours when both solution and battery were nearly
exhausted. 500grains of sulphate of copper were again put into
each cell, the solutions accurately measured, and the current
of 9 pairs passed for twenty hours. The deposit on the negative
electrode was 116-8 grains; this solution had increased in
measure three-eighths of an ounce, the positive had lost half
an ounce; being evaporated and crystallized, the negative gave
226 grains crystals, the positive gave 749 grains. In this ex
periment we have 184 grains of the salt transferred, and only
 three-eighths of an ounce of measurable endosmose.
    960 grains of sulphate of copper were dissolved in 20 ounces
of water and put into the negative cell, while the positive was
 charged with dilute muriatic acid. A battery of 12 pairs
 was connected and kept in action twenty-four hours; it was
 then found that the negative electrode had increased in weight
 178 grains, and the solution had gained in measure 24 ounces.
 A small portion had nitrate of silver added, which gave a slight
 milkiness, but not amounting to a precipitate. The whole solu
 tion of the negative cell, being evaporated and crystallized, gave
 sulphate of copper 463 grains. This shows a transfer of sul
 phate of copper from the positive solution equal to 162 grains.
 The positive solution was of a deep blue colour, it had lost
 by measure 24 ounces; the electrode was covered with a
 white powder, and had lost 212 grains.         Here again the two
 kinds of endosmose are perfectly distinct. But we have another
 curious result, viz. the muriatic acid apparently refusing to
 be transferred from the positive to the negative solution. This
 attracted particular attention, and the next experiment was
 conducted in the following manner:—100 grains of sulphate
 of copper were dissolved and put into a small porous vessel, the
 solution measuring 24 ounces; this was supported at the top
 of a deep glass vessel filled with dilute muriatic acid, so that
 several inches of solution were under the porous vessel, the
 surface of the two solutions being level; by this arrangement
 the copper salt formed at the positive electrode by the cur
 rent sunk to the bottom by     its own gravity and remained un
 der the porous vessel,    so that    no
                                       transferof   salt could take

  place. Two copper electrodes were used, and the current
  continued until the negative solution was exhausted of copper.
  When this was completed the negative electrode had gained
  in weight 25.1 grains: the solution had increased in measure
  half an ounce. On testing this by nitrate of silver, only a
  slight milkiness was obtained. The positive solution was deep
  blue at bottom, but only a slight tinge above the bottom of
  the porous vessel; the positive electrode was coated nearly to
  one-sixteenth of an inch with a white pasty matter, a great
 portion had also fallen to the bottom of the vessel: the elec
 trode had lost in weight 132 grains.          Here we have mea
 surable endosmose      amounting    to half an ounce without any
 transfer of the acid in solution.
     I now took two porous vessels, the one charged with 24
 ounces by measure of a solution of sulphate of copper, the
 other with dilute muriatic acid; these were placed in a glass
 vessel filled with a measured quantity of distilled water, the
 cells placed 1 inch apart; two copper electrodes were used :
 the muriatic acid cell made the positive solution, the sulphate
 of copper the negative. A current from 9 pairs was kept up for
 eighteen hours.      At first the decomposition was exceedingly
slow, but it afterwards increased; the results of this experi
ment were—
     Positive solution lost three-eighths of an ounce, pole covered
 with white powder, and had lost in weight 37 grains; solu
tion contained sulphate of copper.        The solution in the glass
vessel was tinged blue by sulphate of copper, had lost in mea
sure 13 ounce, and gave a copious precipitate with nitrate of
silver, showing a transfer of muriatic acid from the positive
cell.
    The negative cell had increased in measurel 4 ounce. Nitrate
of silver gave no indication of muriatic acid, the electrode had
increased in weight 26 grains.
    A similar experiment was again repeated, the negative cell
and glass vessel being both charged with distilled water, the
positive with dilute muriatic acid; platinum electrodes were
used.     A 9-pair battery was attached for sixteen hours. The
current passing was sufficient to keep deflected a galvano
meter needle, but no evolution of gas was observed till nearly
the end of the experiment, when the poles became covered
with small bubbles of gas not large enough to be evolved.
The results of this experiment were, positive cell lost in mea
sure one-eighth of an ounce. The solution in the glass vessel
was slightly acid, giving a precipitate with nitrate of silver, and
had lost in measure 13 ounce. The negative cell had increased

in measure 14 ounce, did not change the colour of blue litmus
paper, nor give any precipitate with nitrate of silver: here
also, as in the last experiment, we have muriatic acid being
transferred in small quantities from the positive to the inter
vening liquid. But another feature presents itself, the great
amount of measurable endosmose and the almost entire
absence of electrical decomposition; at the same time the en
dosmose being principally confined to the two vessels contain
ing water, as if the acid in the cell had only acted the part of
an electrode.     On reversing the condition of the last expe
riment, the positive and glass vessel being charged with           di
stilled water, the negative with the dilute muriatic acid, 9-pair
battery, for sixteen hours, the positive vessel lost 14 ounce;
the glass vessel had increased 1+ ounce, while the negative or
acid solution underwent no alteration, showing again the en
dosmose only between the two cells containing water.
   Several experiments were repeated both with the single and
double cells, having muriatic acid as the positive solution,
with sulphate of copper, water and alkalies as the negative so
lution; in some    I  had transfer of acid in small quantity, in
others no indication of transfer;     I  believe the cause of dif
ference to be in the texture of the partition;  when a diaphragm
was used less   porous,  the endosmose was    considerable,    in one
case amounting to 4 grains in thirty hours.         Nitric and sul
phuric acids, which are much more easily transferred than
muriatic acid, have also had their transfer resisted by two
closely-textured diaphragms, passing through one into the
mid-division but not into the negative solution: however, these
results show that all kinds of salts or acids are not transferred
with the same facility, probably from their power of conduc
tlOn.
   While operating with the double cells, having an acid in
the positive and water in the middle and negative cells, I have
several times observed that both positive and negative solu
tions increased in bulk at the expense of the middle solution;
in one instance the positive solution had gained 1 ounce, the ne
gative gained three-fourths of an ounce, and the middle solution
had lost 13 ounce. The negative and positivesolutions.originally
contained only 2 ounces, the electrodes measured 2 by 1 inches;
 nevertheless in these instances the transfer of the acid from
 the positive to the negative was considerable.      The different
 acids gave different results of this sort; with sulphuric acid
 the increase was greatest, muriatic acid one-half less, nitric
 acid about one-fourth of the sulphuric; whether this be the
 result of any fixed law     I cannot say, the times    I   have ob

sults  except   with the acids, I am inclined to think the cause
to be what has been already stated, namely, the solution act

in forty-eight hours the zinc cell had lost three-quarters of an
ounce, the platinum cell had gained half an ounce.           This
experiment was repeated many times with similar results.
    Two large cells were filled with distilled water, and a piece
of zinc, measuring 4 by 6 inches, carefully weighed was put
into one division and a piece of copper of the same size was
put into the other division, the current passed through a deli
cate galvanometer, which kept deflected about 3°; the posi
tive solution was kept at a given height, the negative was
taken out as it increased, keeping the two solutions as nearly
level as possible; this was kept up for forty days, when there
was found to have passed through from the positive to the
negative a bulk equal to 32 ounces, allowing for the evapo
ration, which was known by a similar vessel placed alongside.
The zinc was covered with a gray film and had increased in
 weight 12 grains; this being carefully dissolved off by am
monia, water and the zinc again weighed, it was found to have
lost 36 grains, which we may take as the amount of oxidation
 during the experiment.
    The general conclusions which may be drawn from these
experiments respecting endosmose are,
    (1.) That the current of positive electricity passing through
a  liquid is always accompanied with a current of the liquid in
 the same direction.
   (2.) If the liquid contains a salt or an acid that is under
going decomposition, the endosmotic current is principally,                  if
not wholly, confined to that salt or acid, unaccompanied with
water, and therefore adds little or nothing to the bulk of the
liquid into which it passes.
   (3.) When the quantity of electricity which a battery is ca
pable of giving off is greater than the salt or acid can conduct,
the extra quantity, if we may so term          it,
                                              passes through the
water, taking with   it, and thus inducing    flow

     PIECE of clean mica becomes covered like other sub

very small distances from each other, when it is breathed upon
or held over steaming water. The layer of bubbles impairs
the reflecting properties of the mica, and renders objects
placed beneath it imperfectly visible; if by means of a sharp
knife a very thin leaf be pealed off the mica, and thus a new
surface given to       and        it,

of the cylinder: either cap discharged an electrometer on
touching the other with the hand.     When however the air
was rarefied in the cylinder to two lines barometrical pressure,
the electrometer was not discharged, for then the leaf of mica
insulated completely.    The insulation lasted for twenty-two
hours, when on admitting a small quantity of air
was again destroyed, and the mica conducted as well as
before.
   Exposed to the air, mica retains this property but a short
time.   In a few hours parts of the fresh surface become dim
when breathed on; in a day or two the whole surface, and
the mica then insulates to a considerable extent.
   The property of not becoming dim when breathed on is
common to the scaly varieties of gypsum, and probably to
other minerals.    Calcareous spar possesses the property in a
very slight degree, and loses it in a few minutes.

      THEquaternion
           separation of the real and imaginary parts of a

rence, and may be regarded as being so fundamental in this
theory, that it is convenient to introduce symbols which shall
denote concisely the two separate results of this operation.

question in which it occurs,          all

If  Q and Q be any two quaternions, the two products of
their vectors, taken in opposite orders, namely VQ. VQ and
 VQ'. VQ, are conjugate quaternions, by the definition given
 above, and by the principles of the 9th article; and the con
jugate of the sum of any number of quaternions is equal to
 the sum of their conjugates; therefore the products
   (SQ+VQ) (SQ--VQ) and (SQ –VQ) (SQ–VQ)
are conjugate; therefore T. QQ', which is the tensor of                                                   the
first, is equal to the square root                       of their product, that                    is,   of
      (SQ-VQ) (TQ)” (SQ–VQ),                                      or

                  VII.      On Cryptolite.                    By F. Wöhlerk.
     HE    new substance for which, from the hidden manner in
        which it occurs, I propose the name of cryptolite, is
phosphate of the oxide of cerium.          It has only been found as
yet imperceptibly disseminated in the massive greenish or
reddish apatite of Arendal in Norway.           It becomes apparent
when the apatite is placed in large pieces in dilute nitric acid,
appearing, as the apatite dissolves, in the form of fine, pa
rallel, crystalline needles of about a line in length.       The apa
tite from which              I

   The excess arises from the cerium having been determined
as peroxide instead of protoxide, in which latter form it
evidently exists in the mineral. Whether the oxide of cerium
is mixed with the oxides of didymium and lanthanium must
at present remain undetermined, no sure method of separa
ting these oxides from each other being known.          The colour
of the oxide obtained was dark cinnamon-brown, and evi
dently contained no zirconia or thorina. The absence of this
latter distinguishes the mineral from monazite and edwardsite.
Comparative experiments made with monazite and cryptolite
left no doubt that they were perfectly distinct.
   In conclusion, I may mention that cryptolite is either not
quite insoluble in nitric acid, or the apatite of Arendal con
tains another cerium mineral which is soluble; it may pos
sibly be monazite. On separating cryptolite and precipita
ting the saturated solution of apatite in nitric acid by an ex

to redness, and dissolving the carbonate of lime thus obtained
in nitric acid, there remained a grayish earthy powder undis
solved. Muriatic acid dissolved this powder, leaving a quan
tity of fluoride of calcium. The solution, evaporated down
and mixed with a boiling-hot saturated solution of sulphate of
potash, deposited in considerable quantity a powdery, pale,
amethyst-coloured precipitate of the double salt of potash and
cerium-oxide, which, decomposed by potash, gave a cinnamon
brown coloured oxide of cerium.
VIII.    On certain Criteria of Imaginary Roots of Equations.
   By   J. R. YoUNG, Professor of Mathematics Belfast Col
   lege”.
        page 450 of vol. xxiii. of this Magazine, I gave certain
 AT new      criteria for the imaginary roots of numerical equa
tions. These, in conjunction with the long-neglected criteria
of Newton, were shown to be of some value in facilitating       in
quiries into the character of the roots of an equation, as by
their aid the mere inspection of the coefficients would often
supply the information not otherwise to be obtained without
a lengthy and laborious analysis. The formulas referred to

sometimes apply where known tests fail, and which, as well

ing one in the former set must hold also, yet one of these may
fail without any failure in the corresponding form of the pre
ceding set.
    The latter forms, when expressed in words, furnish the
following rule, which it will be easy to remember:—
    Commencing with the second coefficient and proceeding
towards the right, or with the last but one and proceeding
towards the left, multiply the successive coefficients by any
series of consecutive whole numbers, and square the results:
the square of each coefficient will thus be multiplied by an
integral square.         Let the product of the adjacent coefficients,
on each side, be now multiplied by the same square minus 1;
and compare these results with the- former, as in Newton's
rule.
    Of course     criteria of this kind, which are to be applied im
mediately to the coefficients of the given equation, cannot
always be expected to make known the exact number of ima
ginary roots entering that equation; yet our chances of ob
taining this knowledge become multiplied with the number of
               E.
our distinct and independent tests for the detection of such
roots. At                 we have no easily applied, and at the same
time completely decisive tests of this kind which extend be
yond an equation of the third degree; yet, as respects equa
tions of the fourth degree, I think a little may be added in
this way, as inferences from the following general expression
 for two roots of the biquadratic equation—
                       a" +  pa’ + q a  +   r=   0,
when the other two we as are          given:-
            _*, ++2 +                          2

    The inferences adverted to are         these, viz.  –
                                  -
    Supposing q positive, which is always allowable, we see
from this expression that,
    1. If two real roots occur in the positive region, the other
two roots must be real also.
    2. If two imaginary roots are indicated in the negative re
gion, the others must be imaginary.              Therefore,
    3.  If  two real roots are detected, without regard to their
situation, and the remaining two are indicated in the negative
region, these must be real also; and if two imaginary roots
are indicated in either region, and the remaining two are                in
dicated in the positive region, these must be imaginary also.

IX.         On the Use of the Word Homology in Comparative
            Anatomy. By H. E. STRICKLAND, M.A., F.G.S.

comparative anatomists should use the term affine or homolo
gous in place of analogous, when speaking of structures which
essentially correspond in different organized beings,                    was                           I
quite aware, though I accidentally omitted to say so, that the
word homologous had been occasionally used in that sense.

was a word of my own coining, but                                   I

  The                  Mr. Macauley appears to entertain of
               ideas which                                                                            in
ductive and    probable  evidence *, as depending on the number
of instances,  have obtained currency in some of our academical

questions—namely the investigation of the laws of nature, the

these phaenomena today affords some sort                      presumption, of

which I have thrown fifty times with the like result will con
tinue to show the same face fifty times more.
   The distinction between the two cases is evidently no other
than this. In the latter I have inferred an invariable cause,
namely that of weight, as determining the event; in the
former I have inferred that causes are operating, which I pre
sume from the frequent recurrence of the event to operate with
some degree of permanence, but of which the duration, till I can
trace the laws and circumstances which govern the eruptions
of volcanoes, is so doubtful and incalculable, that the cessa
tion of the event is almost as likely as its continuance.
   The ebb and flow of the tide, the rising and setting of the
sun, suggest the same kind of thoughts as the determinate fall
of the die: only in these cases it is the generality of the phae
momena rather than their precision which guides the mind to
its conclusion that here             law  is
                                          a          of
                                             nature—a conclusion which
once arrived       at, from however few observations, produces                                              a
certainty that the event will continue, equal                the observa           to
tion     of
         ages.
    But the amount                   of
                               rational certainty      carried much fur  is
ther, when the mind rises                      to

precise and universal laws which regulate the movements                                                     of
the heavenly bodies. By whatever means this knowledge
obtained, the assurance                   of
                                    the future event      carried             is                  by

the highest pitch, and that often after very few observations
indeed;          any one will see, who considers the great degree
                     as
of  certainty which        few sights

same manner as that metal occasions the oxidation of hy
drogen, aether and alcohol. The facts am going to state        I
will show that the correctness of              this conjecture is fully borne
out by experiment.
    Newly-prepared spongy platinum being placed upon a piece
of filtering paper that had previously been drenched with an
alcoholic solution of resin of guaiacum, caused rather rapidly
the appearance of blue spots at the place where the metal had
been in contact with the resinous solution.          My experiments
have further shown that that reaction takes place the more ra
pidly and intensely the more divided the platinum happens to
be of which we make use in the experiment described. What
is called Platinum Black acts therefore more energetically
than spongy platinum does. From the facts stated, it appears
that platinum in a state of minute mechanical division con
ducts itself towards resin of guaiacum like the simple halo
genous bodies, ozone and a number of metallic peroxides.
These facts demonstrate also that the coloration of the resin
ous matter being caused by platinum, belongs to that series
of phaenomena which takes place when that metal is put in
contact with a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, oxygen and
vapour of aether, &c.

     Several chemists, particularly      Doebereiner, Phillips, and

notice of chemists, that in more than one case platinum acts
exactly like common electricity, both of them determining at
the common temperature, for instance, the oxidation of free
hydrogen. Now it being well known that nitric acid is formed
if electrical sparks are made to pass through moist air, it
seemed to me within the reach of possibility, that the same
acid might be produced by platinum, if that metal in a state
of minute mechanical division were placed in contact with
moist atmospheric air.          With the view of ascertaining the
correctness of that        conjecture,  I put a piece of moist litmus
paper in close contact either with spongy platinum, or with
platinum black.         In some cases part of the paper exhibited
a slight reddish coloration, part of it proved to be entirely
bleached, or nearly so.                      I
                                    must, however, not omit to state,
that in the   great  majority   of my  experiments I obtained bleach
ing effects only, and no reddening of the litmus paper what
ever. I am unable to account for the difference of the results
mentioned.        Was the reddening of the litmus paper caused
by some traces of nitric acid formed under the circumstances

This question has occupied many philosophers, and been

ascribe to platinum the power of condensing oxygen so much
as to deprive that element of                     its

of that odoriferous substance that we are to ascribe the che
mical effect mentioned. That conjecture must become still
more plausible,       we take into account the fact that spongy

platinum acts         variety

Taking this view          the   of
                                case, we could not admit that                                                  an
electrical spark has the power          cause directly the formation

of water out of detonating gas, but should                           be obliged to              con
sider the oxidation as occasioned by the ozone being formed
under electrical influence out of aqueous vapour and oxygen.
In other terms, we are obliged to ascribe the oxidation to
the same cause from which we derive the decomposition of
iodide of potassium, the transformation of the yellow prus
siate of potash into the red one, the destruction of vegetable
colouring matters, the turning blue of the resin of guaiacum,
the transformation of the protoxide of lead into the peroxide,
&c., brought about by the electrical brush.     Now, as it can
hardly be doubted any longer that the chemical effects just
stated are due to ozone produced by electricity, the conjec
ture, according to which free hydrogen may also be oxidized
by electrical ozone, seems to be very probable. Indeed, if po
tassium, the hydrogen of colouring matters, the oxide of lead,
&c., are oxidized by the oxygen of electrical ozone, why
should free hydrogen make an exception to the rule?
   But however that may be, the subject under discussion
seems to be interesting, and I add, still obscure enough to
offer an inducement to chemists to apply themselves to                                           its
elucidation       by
                further investigations. The matter merits our
attention the more that       bears so close
                                         it    relation      that    a                     to

dorsal arch, having their cartilages united, and articulated with the
lower end of the sternum. The scaleni muscles invariably act during
the whole time of inspiration.      The external intercostals between
the thoracic ribs are also throughout inspiratory; but those portions
which are situated between their cartilages are expiratory; and
those between the diaphragmatic ribs are inspiratory behind, expi
ratory to the side, and in front, and inspiratory between their carti
lages. Between the intermediate ribs, they are for the most part
slightly inspiratory between the ribs, and expiratory in front, be
tween the cartilages.    The external intercostals of the thoracic ribs
are expiratory behind, and inspiratory in front, if the ribs approach
these, and are inspiratory between their costal cartilages.      Between
the diaphragmatic and intermediate sets of ribs, and between their
cartilages they are throughout expiratory.     The levatores costarum
draw the posterior portion of the lower ribs backwards.        In the ass
and the dog, the upper fasciculi of the serratus magnus are expira

the  greater part of the fasciculi of this muscle is expiratory.    In the
ass, the lower fibres of the serratus posticus inferior are inspiratory,
and the upper fibres expiratory.       In the dog and in man,          are                             all
throughout expiratory.

tion. A glacier, he contends, is not a mass of fragments or parallel
opipedons; neither is it a rigidly solid body; and although it may
be extensively intersected by crevices, these “crevasses” are com
paratively superficial, and do not disturb the general continuity of
 the mass in which they occur. The water contained in these crevices
is only the principal vehicle of the force which acts upon it; and the
irresistible energy with which the whole icy mass descends from hour
to hour with a slow but continuous motion bespeaks of itself the ope
ration of a fluid pressure acting on a ductile or plastic material.

velocities, and of the loss of force arising from increased back pres
sure and the imperfect action of the steam.         For this purpose he
institutes a  comparison   between the velocities  actually  acquired by
railway trains with those which the theory of accelerated motion
would have assigned; and his experiments are made not only on
trains propelled by a locomotive engine, but also on those moving
on the atmospheric railway, which latter affords valuable results,
inasmuch as the tractive force is not subject to the losses at high
velocities necessarily incident to locomotive engines.        A table is
given of the theoretical velocities resulting from calculation founded
on the dynamical law of constant accelerating forces, in the case of
trains of various weights, impelled by different tractive forces, moving
from a state of rest; and is followed by another table of the ob
served velocities in Mr. Stephenson's experiment on the Dalkey
line; the result of the comparison being that in a distance of one
mile and a quarter, the loss of velocity is about one-half of the ob
served velocity.
    A series of experiments on locomotive lines is next related; but
the comparison is less satisfactory than in the former case, because
the tractive force cannot be so accurately estimated; it is however
sufficiently so to establish the fact, that the power lost by the loco
motive engine below the speed of thirty miles per hour is so small
as to be scarcely appreciable, and that the time and power which
are absorbed in putting a railway train in motion are almost entirely
required to overcome the inertia of the train, and do not arise
from any loss or imperfection of the engine. It appears, from these
experiments, that above one-fifth of the whole power exerted is con
sumed in putting the train in motion at the observed velocity.       The
author then enters into some general remarks on the effects arising
from this source of loss of power, and the practical application of
the knowledge thus obtained. In the atmospheric railway, he finds
that the tractive force of a fifteen-inch pipe is so small (being less
than half that of a locomotive engine), that the time of overcoming
the inertia must limit the amount of traffic which can be carried on
a single line, especially with numerous stations. When a great velo
city is obtained, the tractive force of the locomotive is much re
duced, and therefore a much greater velocity can be attained on an
atmospheric railway.
    The inquiries of the author into the amount of resistance exerted
by the air on railway trains lead him to the conclusion that in the
atmospheric railway the loss of tractive power of the piston from
friction, &c. is very inconsiderable; and that the resistance of the
air is less than had been hitherto estimated, not exceeding, on an
average, ten pounds per ton on the average weight of trains.
    A tabular statement is then given of the results of the experi
ments made by the British Association, for the purpose of com
paring them with those obtained by the author from his own ob
servations, and more particularly from his experiments on the Croy
don Atmospheric Railway.       The general conclusion which he draws
from this investigation is that the resistance of the air in a qui

escent state is less than had been previously estimated, and that the
ordinary atmospheric resistance in railway progression arises from
the air being generally itself in motion, and as the direction of the
current is almost always oblique, from                 producing increased fric

 In fractures of the bones of the skull, when inflammation of the
 brain supervened, there was a slight increase of the total amount of
 phosphates; but no such increase occurred when the head was not
 affected, even although acute inflammation of other organs existed.
 In acute inflammation of the brain there was an excessive secretion
 of phosphates, which returned to the natural quantity as soon as
 the inflammation passed into the chronic state.        In some functional
 diseases of the brain, attended with delirium, the secretion of the
 salts was excessive; but the excess ceased with the disappearance
 of that symptom. In other functional diseases, as in fevers, no ex
 cess was observable.       In delirium tremens, when food could be
 taken, there was neither excess nor deficiency; but in the most
 violent cases, where no food could be taken, the quantity of the
 phosphates was diminished in a most remarkable degree. In the
 general paralysis of the insane, no increase of phosphates was ob
 served. One case of acute paroxysm of mania showed a small in
 crease during the paroxysm; in two other cases of mania there was
 a diminution of phosphates approaching to that occurring in delirium
tremens. Bright's disease, even attended with acute inflammation,
 showed no increase. When only a few ounces of urine were se
 creted, as in dropsy, no increase was observed; and none also in a
very extreme case of exostosis.         In the case of mollities ossium,
there was a decided increase of the earthy phosphates; and at last,
the alkaline phosphates were also in excess, although there was no
indication of affections of the nervous structures.
    The following are the general conclusions which the author draws
from his inquiries: first, that acute affections of the nervous sub
stance, organic and functional, are the only diseases in which an
excess of phosphatic salts appears in the urine; and in acute in
flammation of the brain,             its
                                 amount     proportional
                                                      is      the intensity   to
of   the  inflammation;   secondly,   that     large   class
                                                       in   a    functional    of
diseases    of the brain,    which delirium tremens presents the most
                               of
marked example, the secretion                    of
                                         phosphates      most remarkablyis
diminished; and lastly, that
                                         of no
                                    chronic disease exhibits any marked
excess     in

   Such, briefly, is the well-known history of the discovery of those
planets of our system which required the aid of optical resources
and of persevering search among the stars for the detection of their
existence; and it is interesting to find that we are indebted for our
knowledge of Astraea to a similar sagacity and perseverance.             The
discoverer, M. Hencke, of Driessen in Prussia, is a gentleman who,
at one period of his life, was employed in the post-office of that
town, but who, being gifted with a taste for astronomical pursuits,
has, for the last fifteen years, been rendering himself familiar with
the general features of the heavens, for the express purpose of dis
covering such a body as has now rewarded his exertions. The cir
cumstances which attended the discovery of the other four asteroids
rendered        antecedently, extremely probable that others yet re
                  it,
                      be
                 detected; and the difficulty lay       conducting                          in

    In the introduction    this paper the author drew the attention                                                          of
 the meeting       the remarkable zeal with which cometary observa
                      to
 tions and calculations had been pursued during the last few years,
 both    inthis country and      the continent. on   proof    this,                         In                   of          he
 stated that the fifth and sixth volumes        the Society's Monthly       of
 Notices (commencing with the year 1840) contain announcements

58                         Royal Astronomical Society.
of the discovery of    13 comets, and that the number of communica
 tions received by the Society respecting them amounted to 140.
 The greater number of these comets were telescopic; but there
 were three (viz. the Great Comet of 1843, that of 1844–45, and the
 second Great Comet of 1845) which were visible to the naked eye,
 and therefore capable of being observed with instruments of the
 smallest optical power.     A considerable number of sextant observa
 tions of each of these comets had been communicated, but especially
 of the comet of 1843, made chiefly by naval officers well-accustomed
 to the use of that instrument.     The number of these observations
 was so great, that it was deemed proper by the Council, in the be
 ginning of the year 1844, to appoint a committee to provide for
 their discussion and reduction; and the author, in conjunction with
 Mr. Galloway and Mr. Stratford, undertook this responsibility. The
task of performing the computations was given to Mr. Harris, the
late Assistant Secretary; and the author took upon himself the pre
paration of the necessary formulae and the arrangement of the steps
 of the calculations. The author took occasion, in this part of the
paper, to point out to the meeting how satisfactorily Mr. Harris had
performed the work entrusted to him, the errors detected in a mi
nute examination of it being far fewer than might reasonably be ex
pected in a mass of work of so laborious and troublesome a character.
Mr. Main then proceeded to give an account of the observations
which had been reduced, and an explanation of the different steps
of the processes employed. With very few exceptions, the observa
tions are contained in the fifth and sixth volumes of the Monthly
Notices, and the total number of results deduced from them was
199; and in a table is given the page of the volume at which the
observations under discussion are to be found, together with the
place and circumstances of observation, &c.        Mr. Main then pro
ceeded to mention in detail the principal processes of the calcula
tion. The principal step that needs mention here is the formula
which has been employed for correcting the observed distance from
the effects of refraction and parallax.    It was shown by a mathema
tical investigation, that if Z and z be the zenith distances of the
comet and one of the stars of comparison, and the vertical refrac
tions be aetan Z and a tanz;         also,  if,  the horizontal parallax

thermometer readings used      the work had been conjecturally sup

portant characteristic which it has now acquired of being a true
theory, inasmuch as, being framed to suit one class of comets, viz.
round telescopic ones, it is found, without any addition, to apply to
a class at first sight totally different, viz. the tailed comets, of which
the great one of 1843 is so extreme an example.
   Not only then does there now seem to be a chance, by pursuing
the usual method of astronomical inquiry (comparing prediction with
numerical observation), of ascertaining the laws of these apparently
most capricious phaenomena, but even of proving whether, though
so diverse from everything else in our system, they are regulated by
the theory of planetary gravitation.

   April 14, 1845.-On the Theories of the Internal Friction of
Fluids in Motion, and of the Equilibrium and Motion of Elastic
Solids.    By G. G. Stokes, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College.
   The theory of the equilibrium of fluids depends on the funda
mental principle, that the mutual action of two contiguous portions
of a fluid is normal to the surface which separates them. This prin
ciple is assumed to be true in the common theory of fluid motion.
But although the theory of hydrostatics is fully borne out by expe
riment, there are many instances of fluid motion, the laws of which
entirely depend on a certain tangential force called into play by the
sliding of one portion of fluid over another, or over the surface of a
solid. The object of the first part of this paper is to form the equa
tions of motion of a fluid when account is taken of this tangential
force, and consequently the pressure not supposed normal to the
surface on which it acts, nor alike in all directions.
    Since the pressure in a fluid, or medium of any sort, arises di
rectly from molecular action, being in fact merely a quantity by the
introduction of which we may dispense with the more immediate
consideration of the molecular forces, and since the molecular forces
are sensible at only insensible distances, it follows that the pressure
at any point depends only on the state of the fluid in the immediate
neighbourhood of that point.          Let the system of pressures which
exists about    any  point  P of a fluid in motion be decomposed into a
normal   pressure   p, alike in            P,all
                                    directions, due      the degree    Scom              of

 discussion being given in the Number of this Magazine for December
  1833.
    The observers of the display of September 17, were Mr.     J.  Phil
 lips, at York; Mr. Clare, Mr. Hadfield and the author, at or near
 Manchester; Professor Airy, at Cambridge; and the Hon. C. Harris,
 near Gosport.
    The observers of that on October 12, were Professor Sedgwick, at
 Dent; Mr. W. L. Wharton, near Guisborough; Mr. J. Phillips, at
 York; Mr. Clare, Mr. Hadfield and the author, at or near Man
 chester; Dr. Robinson, at Armagh; Professor Airy, at Cambridge;
 and the Hon. C. Harris, at Heron Court.
    The observations of the aurora of September 17 at Cambridge at
 8h 25" Greenwich time, taken with those at Manchester at 8" 24m,
 give the height of the lower edge of the arch 56 English miles, and
 of the upper edge 71 miles.
    The observations of another arch, seen from 10° 49" to 11h 19m
 at York, and from 10° 49%" to 11° 4%;" near Gosport, give the
 height of the lower edge 389 miles.
    The observations on October 12, at 7h 56m at York and at 7h 54m.
 at Cambridge, give the height of the upper edge of an arch 72.2
 miles.
    The observations at Guisborough at 8" 20", and at Heron Court
 at 8" 22", give the height of the under edge of the arch seen at that
 time 70.9 miles, and of the upper edge 85.5 miles.
    The observations at Dent at 8° 55", taken with others at Man
 chester at 8" 54", give the height of the upper edge of that arch
 84.97 miles.
    The last arch remained stationary about a quarter of an hour, and
 therefore the observations are the more valuable; but combining an
 observation at Armagh with those at Manchester, the height comes
 out only 64.47 miles; and even with the utmost allowable latitude
 to the deductions from the observations, the height comes - out 66.5
miles.
    The last arch having been noticed to have risen to a higher alti
tude at the same places, a calculation with the corresponding data
gives the height 65.4 miles.
    These last three results are remarkably in accordance with each
other, but considerably different from those for other places at nearly
the same time; so that probably the method which was used, of ob
taining a base line by projecting the places of observation upon an
intermediate magnetic meridian, is only approximately correct, from
the course of the arch over the earth's surface, rather than geome
trical reasons.
    Another arch was noted by most of the observers from 10° 34"
to 10h 45". The observations at Dent at 10h 40”, and Heron Court
at 10° 37", give the height of the upper edge 59.4 miles.
    An observation made by the author on the extent of the arch, on
September 17, upon the horizon at 8" 40}", and     itsaltitude, for ap
plication to the formula  he  has given in the Edinburgh Journal    of
Science, before was joined with the Philosophical Magazine, for de

termining the height from observations at one place by the help of
an hypothesis, gave the height 53.9 miles, which is a near approxi
           to the height found by the trigonometrical method for
8h 25m.
   The author concludes that the meteor occurs immediately beyond
the ordinary limits assigned to the earth's atmosphere, and from that
to very much greater altitudes, as shown by many other calcula
tions; and states his conviction that the meteor will be some time
observed with much more accurate means than hitherto, from its
connexion with the earth's magnetism.
   February 23, 1846.-Analytical Investigation of the Disease pre
valent in the Potato during the year 1845. By Geo. Kemp., M.D.,
Pet. Coll.
   This communication may be resolved into two parts; the analysis
of the diseased portion of the potato, as compared with Boussin
gault's analysis of the healthy tuber, and certain deductions derived
from the empirical formulae proposed as representing their respective
compositions.
   The author recognises three stages of the disease : the first ap
pearing as dark brown patches under the skin; the second as striae
of the same colour proceeding towards the centre; and the third as
a soft, pultaceous, blackish, and offensive mass, in which all traces
of organization are lost.
   From the impossibility of isolating the portions affected by the
disease, in the first two stages, from the surrounding sound parts,
the examination was principally directed to the third stage.
   A potato having been selected in which the above characters
were well-developed, a sufficiently large portion for comparison still
remaining perfectly sound, gave the following results as indicative
of the relative proportions of organic and inorganic matter in the
 sound and unsound part.
   Of the sound portion,-
         I.  247 milligrammes gave 10.5 milligrammes of ash.
        II.  205.5             ---        8.
   Of the unsound portion,-
          I. 311 milligrammes gave 18 milligrammes      of ash.
        II.  234        ---   ---        13
       III.  236       - --  - e.e.     13°5             ee
    Or, reducing to 100 parts, the sound portion consists of
                                            I.          II.

   The mean of the former is 4:19 per cent. of ash, that of the latter
5'68, making an excess of 1:49 per cent. arising from loss of organic
matter.

  March 11, 1846.-On some Secular and Diurnal Motions of the
Earth's Crust, &c.    By Robert Mallet, Esq., Mem. Ins. C.E.,
M.R.I.A., President of the Society.
  The President said, that on taking the chair for the first time, he
could not better mark his sense of the great honour which the So
ciety had conferred on him in electing him their President, than by
laying before them a plan which he had for some time conceived for
the organization and carrying out of arrangements for a great, com
bined, and comprehensive movement for the promotion of a parti
cular branch of geological discovery.
    Geology might be divided into topographical and physical, both of
which require for their study and development, the confluent aid of
several distinct branches of natural inductive science, as well as of
the exact sciences properly so called. Physical geology, again, might
be divided into several distinct branches, for the cultivation of all of
which, the application of physics, mechanics, and chemistry, in
their largest senses, is indispensable.         For a considerable period it
had    appeared   to him that one of the most important directions in
which    physical  geology could be advanced was, in placing it in con
nexion with a mode of investigation, new as respected geology,
although old as regarded other sciences, namely, measurement; by
the organization and solution of such questions as were capable, in
terrestrial physics, of having an answer in measure, number or weight.
The application of measures to geology might be called experi
mental geology—a branch of the science hitherto, he might say,
unexplored.       Geologists had hitherto contented themselves with
observing what nature had presented to them, and that must, from
the nature of geology, at all times form the staple of                investiga           its
tions; nevertheless, whenever            was possible

 tories in connexion with the magnetic survey should, in addition to
  their magnetic observations, record observations as to the occurrence
  of earthquake shocks. This might be very readily done, since the
  magnetic instruments at present in operation in some of the obser
  vatories were quite adapted to afford the necessary indications with
  respect to the shocks, and other instruments required might be easily
  added, namely, those which it will be necessary to contrive to re
  gister the altitude of the crest of the wave of elastic compression, at
  the moment of its passage—an element in this inquiry of the first
 importance.
     But it happened, that magnetic observatories which were furnished
 with these sorts of instruments, did not generally exist in places in
 which earthquakes were frequent.            It thus became necessary to
 establish, in some places, at least, observatories specially devoted to
  geological purposes as their primary object. It would be highly de
 sirable to have such observatories in the volcanic regions of South
 America—the land of earthquakes; since, in addition to observing
 the velocity of the shock wave, the elasticity of the neighbouring
 rocks, through which the shock had passed, could experimentally be
 determined.      He conceived that it would be quite possible to get
 observatories established there, and he should submit to the Council
 the means by which such a desirable object could most probably be
 accomplished.       Shocks of earthquake were of greatly more frequent
 occurrence than was generally supposed, and occurred in every part
 of the world. Violent ones, producing destructive effects, and which
 were only experienced at limited distances from the centre of dis
 turbance, were comparatively rare; but minor shocks were of almost
 daily occurrence; and, indeed, in a district in Scotland, the number
 of such slight shocks occurring within a certain period had been ob
 served. The proposed observatories, therefore, will be by no means
unprovided with work.
    There was another class of motion to which the earth's crust was
 subject, and to which Sir William Hamilton's note related. Before
reading       it, (Mr. Mallet) might perhaps mention that
                     he                                               much             as         as

as   one which had not been explained, and          occurred   it   him (Mr.          to

                    stated    the moment, his anticipation, that

which I was engaged with you on this and similar subjects, at the
last anniversary dinner of the Geological Society, interested and
excited me at the time very much indeed; and if you think the fore

of being incorporated in any communication of your own to the
Society, it is perfectly at your service for that purpose.

    Mr. Mallet would remind the Society, that the earth's surface was
the medium through which two great waves of heat were continually
transmitted; one proceeding from the sun, by part of which the at
mosphere was heated, and the other coming from the interior of the
 earth towards the surface. In every climate there was a plane lying
between the influences of these two waves, which never changed its
temperature, and which varied in its depth below the earth's sur
 face. As there was thus a transmission of heat from the interior of
 the earth towards its surface, and also from the surface towards the
 centre, the plane of constant temperature, or isogeothermal plane as
 it was called, would be found in any given locality at a determinate
 depth; and if the supplies of external and internal heat were con
 stant, it would always be found at the same depth in the same place.
 But inasmuch as the earth's surface was exposed to temperatures,
 varying with the winter and summer seasons, the level of that plane
 must rise and fall in proportion to the force of the variable wave.
 The average depth of this plane in their latitudes was about sixty
 feet, but was far greater in the tropical climates, in some of which
 the heating power of the sun ranged to a depth of nearly 500 feet
 below the earth's surface.
     The result of the varying intensity of the external wave of heat
 must be the contraction and expansion of the earth's crust due to
 the difference between the temperatures of summer and winter, and
 hence a certain annual motion in the earth's crust, besides which,
 from similar causes, acting in shorter periods, and in less degree,
 there must be a diurnal motion.        To measure this systematically,
 would   be, it appeared  to him,  highly important, not perhaps directly
 to those more obvious    parts of  geology  which treat of the elevation
 of mountain ranges and the depression of valleys, and so forth; but
 inasmuch as it would lead to a region of investigation which was at
 present absolutely unknown; and by penetrating which it would
 probably be found in this, as in so many other parts of terrestrial
 physics, that forces and motions the most minute, and scarcely to be
  detected, when taken in aggregate were essential and potent parts
  of the universal machine. There had yet been no investigation of
  the rate of expansion of any rock, the tables of the rate of expan
  sion of the very few solids hitherto published having reference only
  to substances which were of value to the astronomer or the engineer.
 Therefore with respect to the measurement of these motions, the fa
 cility with which the observations necessary for that end could be

    Protoborate of Methylen.—MM. Ebelmen and Bouquet found that
the action of chloride of boron on pyroxylic spirit was perfectly simi
lar to that upon alcohol. The gas is absorbed with the production
of heat, and the bottle containing the spirit must be carefully kept
cool.     When the disengaged gases after passing the liquor are
very acid, the liquor separates into two portions; the lower one
is brown and extremely acid, and the upper one is limpid and co
lourless, and alone contains the new product. It is to be poured off
and distilled with a thermometer in the retort.        The receiver is to
be   changed  when the  boiling-point  of the liquid has become constant.
The first products contain some hydrochloric acid; two rectifica
tions are sufficient to obtain a neutral product, the boiling-point of
which remains stationary at about 162°Fahr.
    If instead of employing pyroxylic spirit which has been rectified
 from chloride of calcium, the article of commerce rectified merely
from quicklime be used, the liquid, traversed by the chloride of
 boron, becomes of a brown colour, but without separating into
 two portions towards the end of the operation. When this product,
 containing a large quantity of chloride of boron, is cautiously di-                                 -
 stilled, and the product received in a vessel surrounded with ice, se
 paration takes place. That portion only of the liquid which distils
 below 176°Fahr. ought to be preserved; what remains in the re
 tort at this temperature is a black viscid liquid, equal to more than
 half the liquid submitted to distillation.       By rectifying the upper
 portion of the liquid obtained in the cooled receiver, a pure product
 is obtained.
    Borate of methylen is a colourless liquid, which is very moveable,
 and has a penetrating odour, slightly resembling that of pyroxylic
 spirit; it mixes with water, but soon deposits boracic acid. Its den
 sity at 32° is 0.9551, and               its

   Protoborate of Amylen.—When chloride of boron is passed
through potato-oil, the liquid soon separates into two portions, and
at the same time hydrochloric acid begins to be disengaged.            By
pouring off the upper portion, distilling and keeping the products
separate, nearly the whole of the liquid passes over between 500°
and 536°Fahr.      This product, when rectified, yields a liquid, the
boiling-point of which is constant between 5.18° and 527°Fahr.
   Borate of amylen is a colourless liquid of an oily appearance, the
weak smell of which resembles that of the potato-oil.          Its density
at 32° is 0.870; water decomposes it and dissolves the boracic acid;
ammonia also decomposes it; it burns with a white flame with green
edges, and the production of boracic acid.

   The preceding results, the authors are of opinion, tend to show
that boracic acid may form with each simple aether at least two com
pound aethers; one of which is tribasic and contains as much oxygen
in the acid as in the base, while the other contains six times as much
oxygen in the acid as in the base. The tribasic aethers BO", 3C*H* O,
BO3, 3C- H3 O, are similarly constituted to crystallized boracic acid

           DEAR SIR,
     I SEE      in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine,
           that Mr. Mallet has, in a paper on the Secular and    Di
   { urnal Motions of the Earth's Crust, referred to my observa
i    tions respecting the annual variations of my instruments.
     a brief notice, which will be found in the Royal Irish Aca
                                                                  In
     demy's Transactions, vol. xix. p. 193, I expressed a belief
     that these are of local origin, being produced by changes of
     temperature acting in the immediate vicinity of the observa
     tory; and    I  gave the index corrections of the circle during
     the year 1839 to show their magnitude and character.       The
     subject of which I was then treating did not permit any fuller
     explanation; but the following Table, in which I have com
     prised the results of the last eight years, may prove useful to
     any of your readers who pursue the inquiry suggested by Mr.
     Mallet.
        Its second column shows for each month the mean eleva
     tion of the west end of the transit-instrument's axis, as deter
     mined by the level: this operation is in general performed
     every day on which observations are made; and whenever the
     adjustment has been altered, the amount of change was care
     fully measured. As however in such a case the surfaces which
     are moved do not assume a permanent bearing for some time,
     a slight degree of inaccuracy may exist as compared to
        The third column, which gives the change of the horizontal
     point of the mural circle, or (expressing it similarly to the
     preceding) the elevation of the northern extremity of a line,
     on the meridian face of the pier, supposed horizontal at the

    Besides these the transit instrument is disturbed in azimuth
when any sudden change of temperature occurs, and probably
also with an annual period; of this however I have seldom
 obtained measures, as whenever observed it is corrected by
 the meridian mark.                Cold makes the western pivot move to
the south.
    On inspecting the table, it is evident that both these move
ments depend on the temperature, having their maxima and
 minima at the times of greatest heat and cold; the second
 exactly, the first less precisely, but still with a decided ap
 proximation.       Nor do they vary according to the same law,
 which may probably arise from some secondary force acting
more powerfully in one direction than the other.                             Can it be
the infiltration of water into the                    subjacent     strata?    When
sinking a well many years since, no water was found till the
limestone (which under the observatory is covered by about
 100 feet of clay) was bored through, when it rose with great
violence about 40 feet.                    The hydrostatic pressure, varying
with the supply at different times, seems capable of such an
action. The motion of the western point is such as might be
explained in kind, though not perhaps in magnitude, by Mr.
Mallet’s hypothesis of a general expansion, and consequently
increased curvature of the surface of Ireland; but that of the
northern seems to me exactly the reverse, unless we assume
that the expansion of the trap rocks which predominate in

XVI.     On the Connerion of the Circle and Hyperbola; and
  on the Geometrical Interpretation of Imaginary Exponen
  tials.   By H. S. WARNER, Esq.*
    HE following   investigations relate to an interesting branch
       of modern  science;  but as it is dangerous to claim, at
this time, anything  as one's own without a careful examina
tion of preceding writings, and as I am not acquainted with
the recent progress of research in regard to what were called
imaginary quantities, I send these observations for publica
tion, merely on the chance that they are new; hoping that if
they are not so, I may be informed of the fact through the
columns of the Philosophical Magazine.
   1. The assumption on which I proceed is that,
   The proper geometrical interpretation of A                V-1
                                                          is a line
of the length A, measured in a direction perpendicular to that
in which it would have been measured          if
                                            it had not been multi
plied by W — 1.
   2. Taking the equation of the equilateral hyperbola (the
centre being the origin, and, for simplicity, the semi-axis
being the unit of length) y”= w”–1, we find, that for a value
of a (positive or negative) greater than unity, y is possible,
determining the opposite hyperbolas; but that for a value of
a less than unity, the equation assumes the form y” =             1 –
 × (1 — wº) or   y = V  –  1 × V (1 — wº).    Hence   (y=  x^1 — wº
being the equation of a circle whose radius = 1) by the as
sumption above, the hyperbola will be represented between
w- + 1 and v= — 1, by a circle (radius 1) whose ordinates
are measured perpendicular to the plane of a y; that is by a
circle standing upright, or a circle described on a plane at
right angles to the plane of a y, the intersection of the two
planes coinciding with the axis of w. The perpendicular
plane I must, for want of a better name, call the imaginary
plane.
   3. Considering the circle in the same way, we shall find
that for positive or negative values of a greater than unity, it
is represented by a pair of opposite hyperbolas, drawn on the
imaginary plane.       Hence we arrive at this remarkable result,
that the   equilateral  hyperbola and the circle are similarly re
lated to  planes  at right angles to one another, or that to change
the one curve into the other, we have merely to take the imagi
nary plane as the real one, and vice versä. The figure will             il

endosmose,      the electricity taking the dissolved particles with
it to the  negative   electrode and producing the phaenomena of
endosmose. These suppositions therefore became the object
of an inquiry, which I shall now describe in detail.
    I  took a piece of amalgamated zinc, measuring 2 by 24
inches, in such state of amalgamation that dilute sulphuric acid
had no action upon it; this was put into a mixture of sulphuric
acid and water in the proportion of 1 acid to 24 water, and
surrounded with copper, which was placed as close to the zinc
as would allow a free current of the solution between them, as
well as the escape of gas, with the view of interrupting as little
as possible the free action of the acid upon the zinc.              This
was   kept  in action for an  hour, when it was found that the zinc
had dissolved from it 97 grains. This I assumed as the max
imum amount of chemical action which could be obtained be
tween the zinc and acid of this strength, at least under the in
fluence of copper. The zinc and copper being again put into
this liquid, but with the two metals 1 inch apart, connected by
a slip of copper at the surface of the liquid, in one hour there
was dissolved from the zinc 56.5 grains.             The two metals
being again placed in the same position, but connected by two
copper electrodes of equal size placed into a solution of sul
phate of copper, at the expiration of an hour there was de
posited upon the negative electrode 9 grains of copper, and
there were dissolved from the zinc 10.7 grains.            Taking an
other zinc and copper and putting them into the acid con
nected with the first in the manner practised for intensity,
there were deposited in one hour 17 grains.          The zinc in cell
 had lost 18 grains.      With 4 pairs zinc and copper in acid
 there were deposited 26 grains, and dissolved from the zinc
 27-7 grains.     With 6 pairs there were deposited 34 grains,
 and dissolved from zinc 36 grains; and with 9 pairs there were
 deposited 43 grains, and dissolved from the zinc 45 grains.
 And thus it went on increasing in quantity by the addition of
plates until the action of the acid and zinc came nearly to
 the same as was assumed as a maximum, namely, 97 grains;
 with 30 pairs there were dissolved from zinc 101 grains,
 with 35 pairs 99, which       I consider very close to the assumed
 quantity.
     Assuming the position which the results of these experi
  ments suggest,    I would say, that if the chemical energy          in
  duced between the acid and zinc under the influence of cop
  per be equal to 100 grains per hour, but by distance or the
  interposition of a medium of inferior conducting power the
  chemical action is reduced to 10 grains per hour, the remain
 ing tendency or disposition of the acid and zinc to unite

98   Mr. Napier   on the unequal   Decomposition    of Electrolytes.
a theory of electrolytic action, which seemed to agree with the
results of my every-day experience in electro-metallurgy, and
also with various experiments made on a small scale, in order
to test these views more fully.     During these trials      was  I
favoured with a copy of the paper of the late Professor Da
niell and Professor Miller on the decomposition of secondary
compounds, in which the non-transfer of the basic element is
observed, but the statement made at the same time that this
is not universal, some elements, such as potassium, sodium,
&c., being transferred in certain proportions.      These state
ments interfering with my views, induced me to investigate
the subject more closely. The paper now submitted to the
Society forms a portion of these investigations, the results of
which induce me to think it probable that the results ob
tained by these gentlemen were due to what          I
                                                   term unmea
surable endosmose rather than to electrolytic transfer; and
that no basic element of an electrolyte is ever transferred by
electrolytic action, but that the base of an electrolyte which is
being decomposed is the medium or conductor of the elec
tricity through the solution from electrode to electrode. And
the manner in which this takes place I conceive to be as
follows:–
   The double row represents a line of compound atoms form
ing an electrolyte, a the acid or negative element of the elec
trolyte, b the base or positive element of the electrolyte, cc the
wires or solid conductors of the electricity from the battery
to the decomposition cell; the last particles in contact with the
electrolyte may be viewed as the electrodes. The a b particles
are held together by their affinity for each other.
            let
   Now      it    be supposed that    an   equivalent   ofelectricity
leaves the positive terminal  of   the battery and passes along the
solid particles   ofthe conductor, that particle upon which the
electricity rests must  be   for the time  in   higher state

such have been employed, after a certain time (longer or
shorter, according to the strength of the solutions), on deve
loping an impression in the usual manner, it will be found
that the whole of the surface, whether acted upon by light or
not, will become dark and discoloured; and such prepara
tions seem therefore to be of little or no value in photography.
   By adding to them, however, a little acetic acid, the ten
dency to spontaneous decomposition is immediately lessened;
and by combining the three constituents in due proportion, a
“gallo-nitrate” may be formed of any degree of stability (or,
inversely, of any degree of sensibility) required.
   There are, no doubt, many proportions in which the ingre
dients may be united with good effect; but, for general use, no
proportions perhaps are better than the original ones given
by the inventor. It is to be observed however of his formula,
that it is adapted to certain external conditions, and is not
equally suitable where these are different.             It is not equally
suited to   every   climate or   temperature    of the air;  and although
well-adapted to excite paper for immediate use, it is perhaps
less so when the paper is intended to be kept: hence the cause
of many miscarriages in                       its
                                      use, and the necessity for some
thing more than mere formula for

from   its  uncertain    strength),    the  spontaneous    decomposition
already noticed will take place with more                   less rapidity;    or
and, unless the paper             used without delay, the impression

                                  used successfully after many hours.

gether.
    The diluting is a very much simpler and more oeconomical
method, and it is evidently a more certain one.
     Ifthe gallo-nitrate be diluted not more than ten times, it
imparts a high degree of sensibility, but in that case the paper
must be used immediately.           It may be diluted as much as
forty times, and in favourable circumstances will still give an
intense picture. In diluting to that extent the paper becomes
less sensitive, but it is less subject to the spontaneous change,
and preserves          its
                     useful properties much longer.

smooth small hail or snow not falling in flakes, but single
particles.”     The cause of this confusion arises from our                                       in
ability to give any character visible to the naked eye, appli
cable on all occasions, for distinguishing hailstones, sleet,
and globular masses of snow from each other.                  In ordinary
cases, particularly in the summer months, no difficulty is
found in the use of the term hailstones.             We might then de
fine them as     consisting     generally    of fragments     of ice, hard,
nearly opake, and producing various physical effects in pro
portion to their velocity; but a more minute examination soon
shows, that they are generally accompanied with some suffi
ciently small to deserve the name of sleet according to
Kaemtz, and others with no more consistency than flakes of
moistened snow; and if we were to accept the definition of
sleet by M. Pouillet, in this country, where hail is generally
much smaller than in warmer climates, hail storms would be
of comparatively very rare occurrence. In showers of sleet
and snow the same difficulties are sometimes experienced; if
particles of sleet invariably presented themselves under the
form of transparent globules or particles of ice, no possibility
of confusion would exist between them and the other two, but
we also find them sometimes mingled with some that are
more or less opake and possessing a greater size.                 This un
certainty respecting the precise meaning attached to the
words hail and sleet, is found in the accounts of many meteo
rological phaenomena; and it would be desirable, in order to
avoid  it,   todefine the exact sense         which they are employed,

     March 22, 1846.-There was           fall of hail which lasted
                                                     a
several minutes. The hailstones were generally of a lenti
cular shape, about half the size of a French bean, of a dull
white colour, and semi-transparent.        As they fell they were
received in a blanket on this and on the following occasions,
                                of it,
as when folded up in        they might      preserved much longer

contain numerous particles                of
                                  various forms.      Some      these             of
were  perfectly  spherical,  transparent,  and   agglomerated   toge

others were completely opake, black, and globular.                  Other
hailstones contained, besides particles similar            the above-de to

                                         of

   March 23.—There occurred            fall of hail more considerable
                                                a

similar shape.             At

as  soon   they
             as  struck the  earth,  split  into numerous fragments,
which remained loosely adhering together, much like wet sand

or the ices of pastry-cooks.    The others which fell after did
not break up in this way. Several of them, examined as be
fore, disengaged, as they melted, bubbles of air in abundance.
When the stone was reduced to a thin disc of ice, it became
sufficiently transparent to be viewed by transmitted light. It
was then perceived to consist of numerous particles of either
a globular or ovular shape, closely adhering together, and
presenting, on what appeared their surface, numerous very
minute black points. The drop of water which resulted con
tained very slight traces of foreign matter of the most minute
dimensions.     In a few instances I perceived a collection of
spherical globules of a green colour about 0”005. One or
two deposited a particle apparently siliceous, which appeared
to be in the centre of the hailstone.
   April 3, 2 P.M.–There fell some hail for about five minutes.
The weather warm, sun strong, occasional showers during the
day. About half an hour previously I observed brilliant, thin,
white cirro-strati at various points of the sky: before the hail
fell, there appeared a second cloud over head, apparently
much lower than the former, very dense and extending rapidly.
The first hailstones so completely lost their cohesion and
liquefied so quickly, even as they fell on my coat, that    I at
first took them for drops of rain, with which they were ac
companied. Those which I collected resembled a grain of
rice in size and colour.   The dark cloud quickly disappeared
after the fall of hail; the upper ones still remained about the
same.    I had not an opportunity of using the microscope.

    April 6,  5 P.M.–A heavy fall of rain with hailstones about
the size of a sweet pea. Under the microscope, the hailstones,
when sufficiently thin, appeared to consist of spherical globules
of various sizes, as in fig. 1, mixed with others of an angular
outline.    Air-bubbles as usual.
   The foreign matter was found to consist of particles like
sand, and others resembling microscopic lichens.
   May 10, 3 P.M.–Wind N.W. an hour or two previous,
bringing numerous masses of clouds, detached portions of
which rapidly disappeared under the action of the sun's rays.
Temperature warm; shortly before the fall of hail, the wind
blew violently in the most opposite directions.          A few hail
stones fell of nearly a globular form.      Under the microscope
they gave off air-bubbles as usual, and           contained minute   all
amorphous particles, some                      of    an

                                        of

                                     form the air-bubbles.     These
presented      different appearance from the globular particles
                a
before mentioned; they were much less defined and more                                                 ir

escaping. At the time I commenced these observations I was
not aware that this structure of the hailstone had ever been
ascertained before, but                    I
                                  now find that it has been already
stated by several authors.           Descartes, who admitted the ex
istence of clouds composed of solid globules, explained the
formation of hailstones by some of these globules being de
tached, and I believe agglomerated together.                 Berzelius, who
gives in his Treatise on Chemistry a succinct and excellent
account of hail, attributes it to the “agglomération de plu
sieurs grains,” “arrondis et non en cristaux comme la neige.”
In the Encyclopaedia Britannica, art. Hail, we find also that
hail is formed “by many little spherules of ice agglutinated
together.”       It appears surprising, that with such correct de
scriptions of hail there should still exist in works of a more
ambitious character, others so much more imper<U+017F>ect and
erroneous.        In fig. 1, I have traced the forms of these glo
bules: some of them appear more ovular than globular, and
I   believe that such is the real shape of some; although at
the same time we must bear in mind, that a transparent glo
bule of the high refractive powers of water will appear much
distorted if part is seen through others before                   while the     it,

 turn again to a solid condition.    The globular forms of solid
 particles were in consequence    very numerous. The cause of
 this difference was, that in one case the quantity of moisture
 in the air was small, the deposition gradual, and the transi
 tions of temperature from one extreme to the other very small;
 in the other, the moisture was abundant, the temperature of
 the air greatly lowered, and the crystalline action rapid. We
 find the same difference between the crystals obtained from a
 concentrated solution in a liquid exposed to a rapid decrease
 of temperature, and those which are formed in a solution less
concentrated and progressing more gently.           A still greater
analogy is found in the crystals of naphthaline, iodine, cam
 phor, and other substances volatile at the common tempera
 ture, when allowed to crystallize in empty bottles without the
 application of artificial heat,  When either of these bodies is
 driven off in a state of    vapour, the fumes that are formed
 when condensed on glass, present the form of either minute
 globules or of crystals, according to the temperature in which
 they are exposed. When the fumes are given off from either
 of these substances in a state of ebullition, it is found that the
globules are of much larger dimensions than any which are
formed at a temperature below the boiling-point.              On a
former occasion I have fully demonstrated that such is like
wise the case with regard to the fumes of water.         I  will not
attempt at present to offer any explanation of this fact, which
is so invariably the case, that at any time, by the microscopic
inspection of the globules, it is easy to decide whether they are
formed from boiling water or at a temperature below.
    The above observations confirm what we might have al
ready anticipated, that the production of solid globular parti
cles arises from the same cause as that which produces con
                                                         º
fused crystallization; and that in fact it is simply confused
crystallization of separate particles.   The most efficient cause
of this is rapid congelation, which apparently does not allow
the constituent particles sufficient time to group themselves in
geometrical forms, but obliges them to assume that which
their molecular attraction tends to give them. Between the
two extremes, of a globular form and a perfect
prism, frequent shapes which the crystals assume in frost,
we have various intermediate forms which may be considered
as the resultants of the crystalline and molecular powers.
Although by our experiments we may observe the circum
stances in which these globules are formed, it would be im
possible to ascertain by their means, with any precision, the
condition of temperature requisite in one instance to form
small crystals, and in the other minute globules.           But in

nature we not unfrequently meet with experiments performed
for us, which if examined with care would,           believe, furnish           I
us with the desired information.
    In the winter months, during a hoar frost, we sometimes
find, adhering to minute filaments on the hedges, such as those
of the spider's web, very minute globules of transparent ice,
such as exist in hail and sleet.       On other occasions, instead
of  globular  forms,  we find others of crystalline shapes.       Care
ful observations made as they are in process of formation, with
the instruments we possess for examining the state of tempe
rature and the movements of the atmosphere, would no doubt
give us the formula of these two deposits. The same obser
vations would likewise enable us to determine, whether the
temperature of the air around is such that any existing mist
or fog must contain            its

 Yolº        correspondent X. Y., who, in the Philosophical
        Magazine for September 1844, has been pleased to take
notice of my paper on parallel lines, inserted in the Edinburgh
Philosophical Journal for April 1844, alleges that the reason
ing depends on the assumption, that no triangle can have the
sum of             its
             angles inappreciably small.        Now      this    really                                  if              is

   4.  According to my experiments, chemical and voltaic ozone
 are  instantaneously  destroyed by a number of gaseous sub
 stances, ea.  gr.  by olefiant gas, sulphurous acid, fumes of
 hyponitric acid, vapour of aether, &c. Hence it comes that
 phosphorus placed in atmospheric air, mixed with small
 quantities only of any of the substances named, does not pro
 duce ozone, and it is well known that phosphorus remains
 dark under the same circumstances.                      If
                                                the experiment be
 made as indicated under §    3, the electrical brush, lively as it
 may happen to play within the air of the bottle, does not call
 forth in phosphorus the slightest sign of phosphorescence,
 provided the atmospheric air surrounding phosphorus contain
 some olefiant gas, hyponitric acid, &c.

    5. Some time ago ascertained the fact that either platinum
 black or spongy platinum has the power of destroying indigo,
 of colouring blue the resin of guaiacum, of decomposing iodide
 of potassium, in short, of producing oxidizing effects very
 similar to those brought about by the electrical brush or spark.
 That similafity of action made me suspect that, with regard to
phosphorus, platinum being in a state of minute mechanical
division, might conduct itself like electricity, and the results
of my experiments have proved the correctness of my conjec
ture. At a temperature of 4° R. below zero, newly-prepared
platinum black was placed upon a watch-glass; now, as soon
as a piece of phosphorus (having previously been wiped
with filtering-paper) was made to touch the metallic powder
it became luminous, first at the point of contact, and imme
diately afterwards along             its
                               whole surface. On breaking that
contact, the phosphorus turned dark again.

                                 it   is                       that              of
metal, acts upon phosphorus       powerfullyas    spongy platinum
                                                              as
does; for   no   sooner has phosphorus been touched             the              by
silver than the former becomes luminous, even            tempera        at
                                                                        a

which extends to a depth of 26 feet and rests upon gravel.
The peat earth, of a thickness of 10 to 12 feet, consists of a
homogeneous impalpable mass, mixed here and there with
small parts of vegetable remains (parts of grasses; Sphagnum
and other mosses could not be detected).                 This is the true
matrix of the    crystals,   in which here and there blue iron earth
(protophosphate of iron or vivianite) is also found.
   By drying in the air it loses 40–50 per cent. of water, and
is not to be distinguished from the heavy black turf.

It   isprobable that these matters were principally the excre

 nesia and lime.
    The solid excrements of the Herbivora are characterized

128                          Royal Society.
by abundance of phosphate of magnesia, and the deficiency
of ammoniacal salts; the fluid excrements (urine) have; on the
contrary, abundance of ammoniacal salts (from the decompo
sition of urea) and are deficient in earthy salts; relations
which make it probable that the formation of such large cry
stals in such quantities (they occur in thousands) was caused
by a reaction of the urine upon the solid excrements, where
the first gave the ammonia, the latter the phosphate of mag
Ilesla.
    The locality where the crystals are found confirms this as
sumption.       The place where St. Nicholas's church is built
was   occupied    800 years ago by the New Castle (Neue Burg),
which was burnt and destroyed with the whole city of Ham
burg, in 1072, by Kruko, tyrant of the Wenden.                Now it is
most    probable   that the ditch of the castle was   used   as a reser
voir for rubbish and manure          by the inhabitants of the new
built city, who preferred trade, as more profitable, to agri
culture.     So by degrees the ditch was filled, and covered
partly with houses, and a small part of it formed till a late
period an open dung-pit, which was emptied from time to
time. The crystals are found principally below the dung-pit,
and appear to be formed by the infiltration of urine through
a soil consisting of vegetable matters.
    The crystals forming a mineral which has never yet been
described, are named Struvite, in honour of the minister Von
Struve, well-known to mineralogists, and highly meritorious
from the great interest he takes in the advancement of science
in the town of Hamburg.

    The author communicates      a report which he lately received from
 Mr. Jameson, the surgeon of the flag ship at the Cape of Good
 Hope, of the rapidly fatal consequences ensuing from eating small
 portions of the liver of a fish, known at the Cape by the name of
 the Bladder or Toad fish, the Aptodactylus punctatus, or Tetrodon
 of Cuvier. The symptoms were chiefly pain and burning sensation
 at the epigastrium, constriction and spasm of the fauces and mus
 cles of deglutition, rigidity of the tendons, coma, paralysis and con
 vulsions, following one another in quick succession, and terminating
 in death within twenty minutes after the poisonous food had been

    May    7–"      On the Anatomy and Physiology of the Vascu
lar   Fringes    in Joints, and the Sheaths of Tendons.”                By George
Rainey, Esq., M.R.C.S.                Communicated        by  John   Simon,     Esq.,
F.R.S., Assistant-Surgeon to the King's College Hospital, and De
monstrator of Anatomy in King's College, London.
    It has been generally believed that the folds of synovial mem
brane which project into the articular cavities in the form of fringes,
contain merely globules of fat, and are subservient only to the me
 chanical offices of filling up spaces that would otherwise be left
vacant during the movements of the joints. By a careful examina
tion of their real structure with the aid of the microscope, the au
thor has found that they present an arrangement of vessels quite
 peculiar to themselves, and bearing no resemblance whatever to
 that of the vessels which secrete fat; together with an epithelium,
 remarkable by            its
                         form and disposition, and characteristic             organs                         of
 endowed with the function                      of
                                            special secretion.
                                                     a              He has traced
 the presence         of

                                                                     in

of   tendons, and        the bursae mucosae. When well-injected, they are
 seen, under the microscope,                    to
                                          consist      two parts; namely,
                                                                     of          con                          a
 volution       of
                 blood-vessels,     and     investingan  epithelium.    These con
 voluted vessels            do
                             not enclose,                     by
                                                 their anastomoses, spaces like
 those capillaries which secrete fat, and which are                   much smaller        of    a
 size than the former; and the epithelial investments, besides en
 closing separately each packet                          of
                                             convoluted vessels, sends off from
 each tubular sheath secondary processes                                        of
                                                             various shapes, into
 which      no  blood-vessels enter.        The lamina itself, forming these
 folds and processes, consists              very thin membrane studded with
                                                of   a
 flattish oval cells,       little larger than blood-corpuscles, but destitute
                             a

                     or                                    the characters   of    tes                          of
 sellated epithelium, but corresponding more                    what Mr. Goodsir     to
 has termed germinal membrane.                 From all these facts the author
 concludes that the proper office                         of          secrete syno

    From the discovery which was made of the non-coincidence of
the locality of the maximum magnetic intensity, within the Arctic
 circle, with that in which the magnetic direction is vertical, it fol
lowed that the generally prevailing opinions respecting the distri
bution of magnetic force at the surface of the earth were erroneous,
and that even the broad outline of the picture of terrestrial mag
netism required to be recast.           For the purpose of obtaining suffi
ciently copious and accurate materials, by means of which so de
sirable an object could be accomplished, the British Association for
the Advancement of Science requested, in the year 1835, a report to
be prepared, in which the state of our knowledge, collected from a
great variety of sources, with regard to the variations of the mag
netic force at different parts of the earth's surface, should be re
viewed, and properly discussed, and suggestions offered as to the
best means of extending the inquiry.           In the report so obtained, it
was recommended that magnetic surveys of that portion of the
North American Continent, which is comprised within certain iso
dynamic lines, should be procured. The present paper contains the
results of an expedition towards the accomplishment of this object,
recommended by the President and Council of the Royal Society
to be undertaken under the auspices and with the assistance of the
Hudson's Bay Company.             Lieutenant Lefroy, of the Royal Artil
lery, who had received an appointment to the Toronto Observatory,
with a special view to this survey, was entrusted with the conduct
of an expedition in conformity with that recommendation.
    The author gives a circumstantial narrative of the expedition,
together with minute details of the instruments employed, and the
methods of observation adopted; and extensive tables of the ob
servations themselves, both as regards intensity and inclination, at
the different stations where they were made, occupying altogether
about 120 folio pages of manuscript.
    It results from the calculations founded on the data furnished by
these observations, that the geographical position of the point of
maximum intensity, where          its   amount
                                             is    1-88, is  52°19'3 north
latitude, and 268° 01' longitude.         The angle which the major axis
of    the ellipse makes with the parallel    of    geographical latitude is
57° 49'-5; and the values     of     the semi-axes of              of
                                                         the ellipse    1875
are 290 and 110 geographical miles respectively.

       vicinity.    His parents were members       of   the same tribe and
natives   of    the same region. The father was         of

 every variety   of    shade.In      March 1844, when about twenty-five
 years   of   age, Tahtoo was attacked with   a     quotidian ague, having

previously been in perfect health. The febrile symptoms subsided
in the course of a week, but were followed by a general desaua
mation of the cuticle, leaving the subjacent skin of a dingy yellow
hue. A month afterwards, the same process, preceded by a similar
febrile attack, recurred, and was followed by still greater whiteness
of the newly-formed skin, resulting in the complete conversion of a
negro to a white man, retaining the characteristic features and hair
 of an Ethiopian.         This change was accompanied with great sensi
 bility in the skin to the heat of the sun and of fire, exposure to
 which readily excited irritation, and even inflammation; but the
 general health soon became completely re-established.                      In the
 course of three months, subsequently to this change, numerous
 spots of a chestnut-brown colour made their appearance, first on the
 wrists, then on the back of the arms, head and neck, and succes
 sively on the other parts of the body, forming by their extension
 dark patches of various sizes; which, being scattered over the
 whole surface, presented a singularly mottled appearance; and as
 the black colour became predominant, the white portions of the
 skin seemed like patches of irregular shape formed in the natural
 negro skin. With the colour of the skin, that of the hair, which
 had also become white, has been gradually restored to                      former         its
 black hue. During this process                  of

By applying to the chordae vocales the formulae of vibrating cords,
he traces the influence which is exerted on their movements by the
mucous membranes; and finds that they obey, to a certain extent,
the laws of vibrating strings.
    The analogy between the action of the glottis and that of a reed is
next examined, and an opinion expressed that the movements of the
glottis in the vocalization of the sound, partake of the nature of the
reed, during the partial opening and shutting of the rima-glottidis.
    The author next investigates the acoustic relations between the
actions of the glottis and that of the vocal pipe, and the acoustic
effects of flexible membranous tubes on a column of air vibrating
within     it,

March, however, they were forwarded to our Secretary by Captain
Smyth, with the consent of Dr. Lee, and are now the property of

the results may be inferred from this statement, that the extreme
discordance of the determinations of difference of longitude from
sixty signals was only four-tenths of a second. The intermediate
parts have been filled up by the usual operations of surveying.
There is no doubt that the map of this wild tract will be comparable
in accuracy to that of any country in Europe. A general map is in
preparation on a scale of four inches to a mile, with special maps on
 that of twelve inches to a mile.
     At Cambridge, the observations of comets and of the new planet
 have, for the present, superseded those of double stars. The volume
for 1842 has just been published.        Besides the usual matter, it con
 tains the accurate    places of a large number of double stars. During
 the last year,   the meridian observations were confined to stars; for
 the most   part,  either double stars or stars observed with comets. By
 this means Professor Challis hopes to complete a second Cambridge
 Catalogue, at the same time that he effects the reduction of the large
 number of comet observations which he has taken.
     The last year has been marked to the astronomer by the appear
 ance of the Catalogue of the British Association.         This inestimable
 volume, which contains the mean places for 1850 of 8377 stars,
 with all the requisite aids for obtaining their apparent places for any
 other epoch, is an extension and completion of the Catalogue pub
 lished in 1827 by this Society, and so well known as the Astrono
 mical Society's Catalogue.        Both were published under the same
 superintendence, and both bear the name of Francis Baily on their
 title-pages; but though upon the same plan, yet the second appears
 with such additions and improvements as render it a new work.
 For, first, the number of stars is nearly trebled; secondly, from the
 particular attention which has been paid of late years to this branch
 of astronomy (chiefly owing, it may be said, to our own Catalogue),
 the accuracy of the mean places has been immensely increased;
 thirdly, the secular variations of the precession have been added, as
 well as the annual proper motions, so far as they are known; and
 lastly, in the nomenclature, in the exact citation of authorities, and,
  it must be added, in the beauty of the getting-up, every thing has
 been done which the greatest experience and zeal could suggest.
     The preface contains a clear account of the process of composing
 the catalogue, of the formulae employed or to be employed, of the
 motives which directed the author in his variations from antecedent
 authorities,     in short, all that would have been expected from
 Francis Baily on the subject which had occupied him principally,
 though not exclusively, for a quarter of a century.          The work was
 completed, with the exception of some notes, and partly printed, at
 the author's decease, and the task of bringing the whole to the de
 sired end has been ably performed by his friend and coadjutor in the
 labour of constructing and printing our former catalogue, Lieutenant
 Stratford.

 and no one can positively say, or even reasonably suppose, that the
 whole manufacture is not capable of great improvement.
    An attempt has been made by Mr. Simms to furnish the object
 glass for the Liverpool equatoreal from his own workmanship; but
 the indifferent quality of all the optical glass which is on sale (the
 Munich unworked glass is not to be bought) did not allow him to
 attain the degree of perfection which he aspired to. In this di
 lemma, the Town Council have requested the Astronomer Royal to
 purchase the object-glass, tube, and eye-glasses, from Merz and Co.
 of Munich. The mounting which the Astronomer Royal proposes
 to adopt is that sometimes called the English mounting,-namely, a
 transit telescope between two supports, which, united at the top and
 bottom, form the polar axis.          Mr. Airy considers that by making
 these  supports    of  sheet-iron, having   a section something like that of
 a chord and     arc, he will  get great stiffness and solidity with moderate
 weight, and at a comparatively small expense. When thus equipped,
 the Liverpool Observatory will doubtless furnish a plentiful supply
 of valuable extra-meridional observations. This excellent institu
 tion will then be a model of what the science may reasonably look
 for at the hands of those who attend to the interests of navigation
 at the principal ports,         namely, ample means of giving time and
 regulating chronometers, with power to the superintendant of em
 ploying the time he has to spare about that class of observations in
 which a private observer can make himself really useful to the pro
 gress of the science.
    It was mentioned in last year's Report that Mr. Sheepshanks had
undertaken to finish the construction of the standard yard measure
commenced by Mr. Baily.             On examining the state of progress (for
 Mr.   Baily's  last illness seized him when he had hardly commenced
his operations) and the points which were left not satisfactorily de
termined by preceding measures, Mr. Sheepshanks, with the consent
of the Committee, resolved upon a more extensive series of experi
ments than was at first contemplated.             It was found by the officers
of the Ordnance survey, and by Mr. Simms when repeating the ope
 ration, that the hypothesis of equal expansions of metals for equal
 increments of temperature, as shown by the mercurial thermometer,
 is far from exact. Mr. Baily's preliminary measures also showed
 that the differences between certain standards had varied sensibly
 since the time when he constructed the standard scale of the So
ciety.    The method of properly supporting a bar has been recently
considered by the Astronomer Royal, in a paper contained in our
newly-published volume.            This is not a proper place or time for

    The circumstances relating to the discovery of the planet Astraea
were detailed in the last number of the Society's Monthly Notices,
and it will therefore be unnecessary to detain the meeting by any
lengthened remarks on the subject. When the planet was first ob
served in this country it shone with the brilliancy of a star of be
tween the 9th and 10th magnitudes.          At the end of December a
very material decrease in its brightness had occurred, and at the
 commencement of the present month the planet could hardly be
reckoned brighter than the 11th magnitude. There is a hazy,          ill
 defined appearance about Astraea, which makes it a matter of no
 great difficulty to distinguish her, even should there be several small
 stars in the field with her.   Professor Encke was the first to calcu
late the elements of the new planet; his second elements were mar
vellously exact, though based on observations extending over thir
 teen days only. There is a very near agreement in the results of
different astronomers, which shows that we have already closely ap
 proximated to the orbit of the planet.
    In duly acknowledging the service rendered to astronomy by this
 discovery, we must not forget that we owe much to the exertions of
 Professor Encke, who detected the planet again on the 14th of De
 cember, and observed it very carefully at every opportunity.        On
 these observations is based M. d’Arrest's excellent Ephemeris, which
 has been of great assistance to astronomers during the past month.
    Since the last Anniversary of the Society three comets have been
 discovered, and the periodical comets of Encke and Biela have re
 turned agreeably to prediction.
    Father de Vico, director of the Observatory at Rome, and one of
 the Associates of the Society, detected a telescopic comet on the
 night of February 26, 1845. It did not become visible to the naked
 eye, and was not observed after the end of April.
    At the beginning of June a fine comet made its appearance in the
 constellation Perseus. It was followed by astronomers until the end
 of the month, when it was lost in the twilight. There is strong
 evidence in favour of the identity of this comet with that of 1596,
 observed by Tycho Brahé; an elliptical orbit of 249 years' period
 satisfies the observations very well.     Father de Vico saw Encke's
 comet on two days in the month of July, but it does not appear that
 other astronomers were so fortunate.
    The comet of Biela was found at Berlin with the great Fraunhofer
 refractor on Nov. 29, and at Cambridge, by Professor Challis on
  Dec. 1. At this time it was excessively faint, but the agreement
 between the observed places and the positions given by Santini's

 140                 Itoyal Astronomical Society.
   elements is very satisfactory.    In the middle of last month the
   comet became double and presented a most singular appearance, for
   the nebulosities surrounding the two nuclei scarcely joined each
   other, and the whole object exactly resembled two comets in very
   close proximity.   This phaenomenon was first observed by Professor
   Challis, with the Northumberland telescope, on Jan. 15.          It was,
   however, seen in America on the 13th. As viewed in Mr. Bishop's
   refractor on Jan. 24, the comet was much like the dumb-bell nebula
  in Vulpecula seen under small optical power. The distance between
  the two comets has been since rapidly increasing, and the deviations
  of the positions of both comets from those deduced from Santini's
  Elements are now very great.
      On the 24th of January last, Father De Vico discovered a tele
  scopic comet in Eridanus; this is the third comet detected by our in
  defatigable associate. On the subject of comets the Council received
  a letter from our distinguished Associate Professor Schumacher,
  dated May 5, requesting that the observations made in England
  might be immediately forwarded to him, and promising a like return.
  The Council accordingly directed that all observations which came
  into their hands should be immediately sent to M. Schumacher;
  and they hope that those Fellows who observe comets will lose no
  time in communicating their observations through Mr. Hind, who
  has undertaken to forward them to Professor Schumacher.
     The return of Mr. Piazzi Smyth to Europe enables the Council
 to furnish the meeting with a short account of Mr. Maclear's geo
 detical operations.
     The anomalies known to exist in Lacaille's southern arc, and
 which Colonel Everest, when he visited the scene of operation, sus
 pected to have arisen from local attraction on the plumb-line, have
 been the means of leading Mr. Maclear into a very extensive mea
 surement of the same kind, of which, in such a report as the present,
 we can only give a passing notice. When, in 1837, Lacaille's Ob
 servatory at his southern end was trigonometrically connected with
 the Royal Cape Observatory, there was found to be error in the lati
 tude of the former, certainly of the kind which the local attractions
 would cause, but by no means sufficient in amount to explain all the
difference between the theoretical and the measured degree. But
 even this partial explanation was destroyed by Mr. Maclear's subse
 quent measures with the zenith sector at both ends of Lacaille's arc,
which produced results agreeing (as to the length in the heavens of
that arc) almost exactly with that of Lacaille.         The discordance
being thus thrown upon the trigonometrical part of the operation,
Mr. Maclear (1840–41) carefully measured a base of 42,000 feet
nearly on the site of Lacaille's and then re-observed    allhis triangles,
feeling confident that the former stations had been recovered    in  every
instance  to  within few feet. The
                    a                   length of the degree thus found
halved the difference between Lacaille and the modern state of the
theory, being about 200 feet less than that    of the former, and about
as   much more than that   of the latter.   But, the old triangles being
but ill-chosen for  causing errors of observation    produce their least

effects, Mr. Maclear took another and a more advantageously related
system, and found a result agreeing almost exactly with his former
one. Still the effect of attraction at the southern end only remained
imperfectly compensated, and that at the northern not at all.                      Mr.
Maclear then resolved to extend the arc to the length of the usual
European ones, to place the terminal stations in the best positions
which could be found, to swing the pendulum on every mountain,
and to fix the positions of                       all
                                        such points      might      useful   as  future         be             in

serviceable to the common end; as when a drain is cut through a
marshy soil, and the waters of numberless useless pools are collected
and led into one straight channel, which carries the improver through
the before impracticable region, ready to apply his whole energy on
the space beyond.     But although much of this may be said of the
Greenwich documents, still the original observations were so fairly
and fully stated, and are so completely preserved, that they now
admit of reduction with the same exactness as at the time when they
were made. Still it is by no means a simple task to make one's self
conversant, not only with the merits, but with all the peculiarities,
the weaknesses, and the failings of both instruments and observers
for a period of eighty years, as the Astronomer Royal has done.
    The contents of this precious work are comprised in a quarto
volume of above 700 pages, excellently printed, and divided into five
sections. The first is devoted to the ascertaining of the clock errors,
comprising the intervals of the wires, corrections for imperfect tran
sits, and the position of the instrument, the effects of personal equa
tion, and the rules by which the fundamental and determining stars
were chosen; the second section contains the investigation of index
 errors and zenith points of the mural quadrants and circles; the
 third exhibits the computation of the geocentric places of the planets,
 as deduced from actual observations; the fourth shows the compu
tation of the geocentric places of the planets, from the best existing
tables of each of the bodies; and the fifth section gives the compa
 rison of the observed with the tabular places, and expressions for the
discordances in terms of the heliocentric errors of the earth and
planets. These sections are briefly yet luminously described in an
introduction of only thirty-four pages: but, though short, it would
be difficult to name another specimen of astronomical writing of
equal clearness and excellence.     There are then twenty pages of the
errata  detected,  either in the published  volumes of the Greenwich
Observations, or in the fundamental tables on which the planetary
computations are founded; and the book concludes with nineteen
skeleton forms of the schemes employed in reducing the matter.
The whole is so lucidly and methodically arranged, that any one with
a very moderate amount of elementary knowledge can take up an
observation, and conduct the process to the end; for he will be able
to check every important step in the result by a reference to the vo
lume itself, to the formulae, and to the skeleton forms.

    But if may venture to express my opinion on this point, I would
 add, that it is very improbable that a casual examination of the steps
 of the processes should produce any useful result beyond that of
 gratifying a laudable curiosity, or familiarising the student with cal
 culations and investigations of this kind.     In     all

lous revisal. The advantage of accuracy need not be insisted upon
here, and I feel confident that the present book approaches in this
respect as near perfection as, humanly speaking, that limit can be
attained.
   Such is the work which your Council have considered it their duty
thus to appreciate. The masses of results obtained by this operose
application of thought and labour may be likened to the extraction
of ore from the dross of an ancient furnace; and I am gratified in
having already had the satisfaction of publicly expressing my high
sense of the vast importance of the task.    Every stage of the under
taking has stamped the Astronomer Royal as being fully in com
mand of the whole process; and in exhibiting the rare union of
large conception, profound learning, and pains-taking practice, prove
him worthy of being the leader of the astronomical establishments of
the kingdom.     From the well-directed exertion of such talents the
scientific world now reaps the benefit of the enormous calculations
before us, the whole utility of which cannot yet, probably, be speci
fically stated.   But we know, that whatever improvement may be
made in the theory or constants of any one of the planets, or of the
earth, the effect will be shown in its corresponding influence on the
heliocentric places of the earth and planet.      Now, the equations
which connect the variations of these elements with errors found by
observation are all tabulated and grouped ready for the geometer's
use, without requiring him to look beyond the fifth section, and with
a degree of precision which no single computer could ever hope to
arrive at. And as in botany we assume a new aera from the time
when Linnaeus reduced the disjointed facts and instances of his day
into a methodical system, by which men were able to make them
selves masters of every truth which had been discovered up to that
period, and turn their attention to something certainly new and use
ful; so may we, perhaps, date a new epoch in planetary astronomy
from the appearance of the great work before you, since the deside
rata in this department of the science are rendered visible, and the
necessity for exact instants, a greater refinement of methods, and
more delicate observations made apparent.

          ON AN IMPROVED METHOD OF DETECTING ALUMINA.
                         BY MR. J. C. NESBITT,
                  depends on the insolubility of the phosphate of alu
         HE process
        mina in acetic acid, and the two following experiments will
show the advantages of this test:—
   1st. Two grs. of alum were dissolved in 1000 grs. of water, and
a single drop of this solution was mixed with a little solution of
phosphate of soda, to which acetate of ammonia and acetic acid had
been added; in a few minutes a precipitate of phosphate of alumina
was produced.
   Another drop was mixed with ammonia, and the usual tests were
employed to detect alumina, but no precipitate was produced.
   Some ordinary solution of potash was mixed with a strong solu
tion of muriate of ammonia. The mixture showed no change after
the lapse of two days.
   Another portion of the same solution of potash was mixed with a
solution of muriate of ammonia, containing a few drops of solution
of phosphate of soda. A precipitate was produced in the course of
                                                   -
twenty minutes or half an hour.
   In order to detect alumina in the ashes of plants, or in substances
containing similar ingredients, it is merely necessary to precipitate
the oxide of iron     any     (if
                              present) and the alumina
                                             be              phosphates,                             as

washed with cold water; they are then dissolved in boiling water
and recrystallized; again well-washed, and finally dissolved in as
small a quantity of boiling water as possible; a little animal char
coal is to be added, and the ebullition continued for a short time;
on filtration and cooling, the new body crystallizes as a bulky assem
blage of tufts, filling the vessels; on drying they form into paper
like masses, of a perfectly white colour and a beautiful silky lustre.
   This body is sparingly soluble in cold water, considerably more so
in hot water; soluble in ammonia, from which it crystallizes as the
ammonia is driven off by heat; it is likewise soluble in acids.
   From the process pursued in separating this substance from cochi
neal there is no doubt that it pre-exists, and is not produced by the
operation; it may, however, be a product of oxidation of some part
of the insect during                      its
                             preparation for commerce. Three hundred

    Several salts of the new acid were prepared and examined by M.
Kosmann.
    Digitoleate of Potash.-The acid was treated cold with bicarbonate
of potash and water; the solution is slowly effected, but takes place
in a few hours with the slow disengagement of carbonic acid; the
filtered solution was evaporated to dryness by the water-bath, and
the residue tested with cold alcohol of 85 per cent., which dissolved
the potash-soap; the alcoholic solution filtered and evaporated left a
greenish-brown residue, which became a confused crystalline mass
intermixed with needles, the odour of which was aromatic, and the
taste bitter and acrid; it does not effervesce with acid, and yields by
the action of heat an odorous matter and carbonate of potash. The
aqueous solutions froth like soaps.
    Digitoleate of Soda.—This salt was prepared like the preceding,
with bicarbonate of soda; the alcoholic solution left by evaporation
a scaly mass of a brownish-green colour, without any trace of cry
stallization; the aqueous solution, frothed by agitation, does not effer
vesce with acid, and has a bitter acrid taste.              This soap is soluble
in aether, and by the action of heat emits an odorous vapour, and
yields a residue of carbonate of soda.
    Digitoleate of Morphia was prepared by the double decomposition
of digitoleate of potash and acetate of morphia. The properties of
this salt are, that it is a greenish precipitate, which adheres strongly
to the sides of the vessel.      After repeated washing, it was treated
with alcohol, which dissolved it and formed a bright green solution,
that deposited by slow evaporation fine flattened rectangular prisms
with square bases, the colour of which was greenish with a metallic
lustre; they were insoluble in water.—Journ. de Chémie Médicale,

tinstone, which is more recent. It was long taken for brown spar
(dolomite), for it is red or reddish-white in crystals, and presents in
its combinations P, r, T, and l, so that the last three forms, with
nearly equally extended surfaces, resemble a rhombohedron.

dimorphism,     for oligoclase is plagioelastic, and yet both must be
classed under the same genus.       Loxoclase fuses before the blowpipe
with difficulty   (fusibility between adular and labrador), and shows
in the outer flame an intense soda reaction. (Oligoclase melts pretty
easily.) Heated in a small glass bulb it gives out a little water and
fluoride of silicon, and is very imperfectly decomposed by hot muriatic
acid. Loxoclase occurs with pyroxen, graphite, and calcareous spar,
upon the two former covered by the latter, at Hammond, in the State
of New York.-Poggendorff's Annalen.

through a transparent solid or liquid medium not possessing
forces of double refraction, the ray is rotated according to a
simple law of action, which I have expressed in the last part

were on the contrary sides of the parallelopiped; so that each
end was furnished with a good plane reflector, but these over
lapped each other (fig. 2). In consequence of this arrange
ment, a ray of light could be transmitted diagonally across
the length of the piece of glass; or the ray, after entering at
one end, could be reflected two or more times within the glass
and then passed out.
     A similar piece of heavy glass was silvered at the two ends
and one side of the prism; and the silvering was then re
moved at the ends for the space of 0.1 of an inch from those
 edges which were the furthest from the silvered side (fig. 1).
 A ray of light passing in at the unsilvered part of one end
 with a certain degree of obliquity, could be reflected at the
 other end, then at the side, and again at the first end, passing
 thus three times along the glass and
 finally out at the second end. At                         Fig. 1.

the purpose of gaining some further insight into the compo
sition and nature of these salts, and of deciding the question
of the existence of the pure compounds of iron of which the
formulae have been given on purely theoretical grounds.
    It is well known that when ferrocyanide of potassium is
boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, only a part of the cyanogen
is given off as hydrocyanic acid, and that a greenish substance
remains behind containing all the iron and a considerable
quantity of the potassium in combination with cyanogen; also
that this substance by exposure to the air gradually changes
into a deep blue. This process is much favoured, as Gay
Lussac observed, by the presence of free acid, and is accom
panied by the formation of a potassium salt of this acid. This
green substance consists, according to the analysis of Everitt,
 which M. Geiger repeated in this laboratory, of 3 equivalents
 cyanogen, 2 iron and 1 potassium. My analysis confirms this
 composition. 2:372 grammes ferrocyanide of potassium were
 distilled with water, and sulphuric acid equivalent to the quan
tity of potassium in the salt, and the distillation was continued
 until no more prussic acid passed over. The residue, after
this treatment, was washed out on a filter, air being excluded,
 dried and cautiously heated in a platinum crucible with con
centrated sulphuric acid, which decomposed            the cyanogen         all
and converted the iron and      potassium    into  sulphates.   The
aqueous solution       these salts was decomposed
                                 of                       ammonia,               by

advantage.         This liquid, in which the white salt, prepared as
 above      described,   is suspended, is heated in an open basin,
 during which the liquid is frequently stirred. At a low tem
 perature no apparent action ensues; but when the liquid has
 nearly reached the boiling-point, an evolution of nitric oxide
 commences, which gradually increases in briskness, and is
 accompanied by a speedy change of the white colour to dark
 blue. As soon as this action has commenced, the basin must
 be removed from the fire to prevent too violent an action,
which would cause the admixture of another substance.                                                   If
the correct proportion of white salt to acid has been used, the
action continues without further heating until the transforma
tion into the blue compound is complete.                        however, the If,
colour should indicate that some                 the white salt remains,

    On treating this body with potash, peroxide of iron is se
 parated and a brownish-red liquid formed, in which proto
 and persalts of iron give a blue precipitate.            This liquid is
 decomposed by boiling, peroxide of iron is precipitated, and
 the colour of the precipitate becomes much lighter.                 am                           I
 not  aware,  however,   what is the nature of the      decomposition.
 The brown-red colour of the liquid has much similarity with
 that obtained by mixing ferridcyanide of potassium with a
 persalt of iron. The green substance which Pelouze obtained
 by decomposing yellow prussiate by chlorine, and for which
 he gives the empirical formula Fes Cya, is decomposed in a
 similar manner by potash.                      If,

 164                  Dr. Williamson     on the
the manner described in the preceding instance, and was
 found, though not absolutely free from potassium, to contain
 so extremely small a quantity of this element, as to render a
 determination of it next to impossible; so that the difference
 produced by neglecting it fell far within the limit of the or
 dinary limit of analysis. After drying at the ordinary tem
 perature over sulphuric acid it was subjected to analysis.
    I. O-765 grim. gave 0.383 peroxide of iron,  -
                                                     corresponding
 to 34.6 per cent. of iron.
    II. 0.763 grim. gave 0.379 peroxide of iron, corresponding
to 34.4 per cent. of iron.
    Burnt with chromate of lead,
    I. 0.535 grm. gave 0.344 carbonic acid and 0.155 water,
 corresponding to 17.5 per cent. carbon and 28.9 water.
    II. O-563 grim. gave 0.359 carbonic acid and 0.157 water,
 corresponding to 17.4 per cent. carbon and 27.9 water.
    III.  0.477 grm. gave 0.307 carbonic acid and 0-135 water,
 corresponding to 17.5 per cent. carbon and 28-2 water.
    The proportion of 5 equivalents of iron to 6 of cyanogen
 requires to 34.5 of iron, which is the average found, 182 car
 bon instead of 17.5, as is found. If it be considered that the
 error of iron and carbon determinations are here added to
gether, the accordance will     I think be held to be sufficient.
 My reason for not calculating any formula for the water was,
that owing to the readiness with which the compound is de
composed, I was compelled to analyse it without drying at
an elevated temperature, which would have produced an evo
lution of hydrocyanic acid. On decomposing this substance
in the fresh prepared state by potash, proto- and peroxides of
iron are set free and ferrocyanide of potassium formed. A
portion of this compound was, after carefully washing out and
without drying, decomposed by carbonate of potash. The
proto- and peroxides of iron, thus separated, after long-con
tinued heating in the air, weighed 1-627 grim. of peroxide.
The liquid boiled in and treated with sulphuric acid gave
 1.077 grm. peroxide of iron.      The proportion of 3 to 2 re
quires 1-623 and 1-082.      Of 5 equivalents of iron 3 were se
parated in combination with 4 atoms of oxygen of the potas
sium, which takes their place, while the other two being con
tained in the composition of the radical remained in solution.
    I will now pass to the consideration of the manner in which
we may consider these elements to be combined.            It is well
known that    ferridcyanide  of  potassium   is reduced  by the ac
tion of sulphuretted hydrogen, that is to say, it takes up hy
drogen, and is thus converted into a mixture of 3 atoms fer
rocyanide of potassium and 1 atom hydroferrocyanic acid (or
ferrocyanide of hydrogen).

   The fact of the red cyanide being thus reducible is how
ever a property which may in the above instance exercise a
considerable influence on the composition of the product, as
is shown by the following instructive experiment of Liebig.
To a boiling solution of ferridcyanide of potassium was added
a small quantity of protosulphate of iron, which was not nearly
sufficient to decompose      the cyanide.allFerrocyanide    po                                 of

  By the action             of   light   a    process       of     reduction takes place,

168                                Dr. Williamson            on the
as was remarked above          in the case of another compound.
With other     cyanogen     compounds      a similar action occurs, of
which I will mention a striking instance further on. On de
 composing this substance by potash, ferrocyanide of potas
 sium is formed and peroxide of iron set free.          Experiments,
               I
in which endeavoured to determine quantitatively the pro
portion of iron separated by potash, invariably gave more than
the formula of the pure substance requires, but this seems to
 be accounted for by the formation of the above-described
basic compound.
    In aqueous oxalic acid the prussian blue is very easily so
luble.    By the addition of carbonate of potash to this liquid
the colour is changed to a red-brown, but no iron is precipi
tated at the ordinary temperature; as soon however as the
 liquid is boiled, peroxide of iron falls down in the proportion
 of three-fifths of that contained in the blue compound.
    An unweighed quantity of dried prussian blue was dis
solved in oxalic acid, and by boiling with carbonate of potash
0.208 peroxide of iron were precipitated.            The liquid con
tained 0-137. The       proportion   of 3 to 2 requires 0.207 and
0.138. On a second determination 0.274 were precipitated
by potash, whilst 0.174 remained in solution. The propor
tion of 3 to 2 requires 0.268 and 0-179. This reaction with
oxalic acid might reward further examination. A remarkable
circumstance connected with it is that the liquid after being
filtered off from the peroxide of iron, separated by potash, is
precipitated blue by muriatic acid.
     Ihave now endeavoured to describe the formation of prus
sian blue under different circumstances, and the influence
which these exercise on                  its
                                 composition, giving particular at

     It
      is evident, from the quantity of water found, that less
hydrogen was in the substance than calculated, and that a
portion of peroxide of iron was contained in                                            it.

The corresponding dingy yellow precipitate of ferridcyanide
also contains potassium.     On decomposing it by potash, fer
ridcyanide of potassium and oxide of copper are obtained,
which proves that it is a true ferridcyanide, and not analogous
to Turnbull’s blue.
   The reducing action of light shows itself most strikingly in
the case of this precipitate.   It had, after drying, been kept
in large pieces in a glass bottle which stood for some time
near a window. All the outsides of the pieces turned towards
the light, became of a red-brown colour from the formation
of ferrocyanide.
    On treating the ferrocyanide of copper above described
with sulphuretted hydrogen, no action at first seemed to take
place; after some time however it commenced; and on the
decomposition being completed a strongly acid solution was
formed, which became gradually blue on exposure to the air.
It gave a blue precipitate with perchloride of iron, but did
not possess the characteristic reaction of hydroferrocyanic
acid, for it was not precipitated by aether. On adding mu
riatic acid this reaction however immediately appeared. By
standing over sulphuric acid it dried into a blue mass with a
coppery lustre, which with water formed a liquid not unlike
a solution.
    On analysis it gave to 0.487 peroxide of iron 0.261 sul
phate of potash.     The formula,                requires

DURING Hamilton, one in your own Magazine       and the other in

be unseemly to enter into a discussion of the general question.
respecting the correctness of the views entertained by this   di
stinguished analyst, or even respecting their originality. This
must be reserved till we have their full development before us.
However, the limited case of which some small use has been
attempted in your last Magazine by Mr. Warner, is fairly
open to discussion, since the doctrine itself is one of consi
derable standing (almost eighty years) in the mathematical -

Also from this the same conclusion respecting congruity                                                                       is

x     W-1      is a real quantity involving                        no incongruous               opera

this possible transformation of the conditions under which
a theorem involving incongruous operations (whether in pure

   The symbol w/–1 does not express perpendicularity, but
only incongruity amongst the geometrical conditions from which

                         consider to be of very unfrequent occur
rence. The first is an extraordinary rainbow, which was seen
on the 25th of last April during a partial eclipse of the sun.
I was at Paudex, a little village on the shore of the Lake of
Geneva, nearly two miles east of Lausanne.          The sky, which
was cloudy in the morning, cleared up in the afternoon.            A
single band of cumulo-strati, at a slight elevation, rested on
the ridge of the Jura, in the west, where, half concealing
the sun, it received from it a golden light scarcely supportable
by the eye, and which prevented the observation of that lumi
nary. Towards 5 o'clock a double iris was perceived, pre
senting the usual interior and exterior arcs; the first accom
panied by six exterior supernumerary bands, red, green, red,
green, reddish, pale green.        At this moment there was no
rain between the sun and my eye, and the surface of the lake
was smooth as a mirror; but a hard shower fell upon the
rocks of Meillerie, situated on the opposite shore, and veiled
their summits. By degrees the nimbus or rain-cloud went off
to the S.S.W.       I returned home in the direction of the sun;
then, after a few minutes, wishing to examine again the rain
bow, I no longer observed any secondary bands, nor the two
concentric arcs above mentioned.         A brilliant column of the
brightest colours was formed over the lake, which appeared to
penetrate to      bottom. This column was violet

a dark space similar         spherical angle

colours sparkled so that it was impossible to determine the
spot where the separation of the tints between the two arcs
took place. The development of these various phases com
menced at a quarter to six o'clock; the last continued eight
to ten minutes, and all vanished some instants before sunset.
Mr. Frederick Chavannes, mathematical instructor in the
Gymnasium of Lausanne, and member of the Society of Na
tural Sciences in that city, witnessed this phaenomenon, and
agreed in describing it as have done.          I
    Does this extraordinary eccentric arc proceed from a second
illuminating point placed at the same height as the sun, or
from a very resplendent nubilous band?                  I am inclined to
think that it is     produced     by  the reflexion of the luminous
rays on the surface of the lake. This circumstance, in dimi
nishing their intensity, must have caused                 trace      the ex             all             of

clear, the air calm, the meteor less brilliant than the evening
before; it was seen suddenly on the horizon at a quarter past

Lastly, on the 28th, the Bise was strong, and fleecy clouds
were perceived around the luminous band, which lasted until
forty-two minutes past eight.     It appears certain that it was
always seen single, vertical, and with parallel edges.

            phaenomena of endosmose and exosmose were attri
THE      buted by Dutrochet to the passage of currents of elec
tricity of unequal intensity through a membrane situated be
tween two fluids of different densities, these currents being
supposed to carry with them unequal quantities of fluid.                                     Al
though the facts of endosmose and exosmose, as described by
this philosopher, are admitted by                  correct, yet his ex
                                                  all   to   be
planation       them has not been generally received; nor am
                of                                                                           I
aware that they have ever been explained                 manner gene
                                                                  in    a
rally satisfactory, and therefore shall      I      obliged  be you will      if
insert   inyour    valuable  journal  the  following  explanation.
  It   is  fact which probably no one will question, that when
            a
two fluids      ofunequal density are brought into contact           mi                 in
nute   quantities,  without   any  membrane     being  interposed,  they
will intermix         by
                      diffusion, the rarer fluid intermingling itself
with the denser one, and the denser fluid diffusing itself
through the rarer one, until the one becoming gradually more
dense, and the other less so, the whole mass acquires one uni
form consistency. However, should this fact                  doubted,        be
can    be well illustrated        by
                                introducing between two surfaces                               of it
glass, placed almost           contact, some thick mucilage, and
                                 in                                                            a
little thin coloured fluid           any kind, for instance common
                                       of
writing-ink, and observing with the microscope the part where
they become united, when the two fluids will                        be
                                                         seen gradually
to   intermix, and         to
                           become            so
                                         blended together, that their
line of union will become lost.
    The same fact can            be
                               shown          by
                                           introducing some mucilage
into piece
     a           ofthermometer tube, and after                    it,
                                                          the same end, at
some    writing-ink.      The coloured fluid will        first pass only
                                                                    at
in a   small column     through    the  mucilage,  along   the centre                          of
the tube, leaving the mucilage               contact with
                                                  in            parietes,         its
but afterwards they will become gradually blended together.

 But the characteristic feature                              of

that the rarer fluid passes through the interposed membrane
more rapidly than the denser one; and therefore that                           ac                               an
cumulation takes place             that side      on                    of

was placed.       The reason          this     obvious; for had
                                                       of          is        been                              it
otherwise,               or
                  even had these        quantities    been    equal,    then the
rarer fluid must have repassed through the interposed mem
brane, after        density had been increased
                            its                                 intermixture             by   its
with the denser fluid,          rapidly      as passed through    as
                                                                   it      before                          it
 itsdensity had been thus augmented;                  from the commence      or

          Mr.   J.   Cockle on the Solution of certain Problems.                                           181
ment of the operation the dense fluid must have passed with
the same velocity through the membrane as the rare one,
which is contrary to the second fact.          Therefore, in case of
diffusion of two fluids of unequal densities through a porous
partition, the fluid MUST accumulate on that side of the parti
tion on which is situated that fluid which passed through it
most slowly.
    This explanation is applicable in            cases            all
                                                             which the                in
rarer fluid on the one side of the membrane has the same
chemical properties         that                     on
                                     the other side, their difference
                                      as
being only        their degree
                   in              density.      of
  If   these fluids             be
                        dissimilar     respect     their chemical qua
                                                      in              to
lities, still the accumulation will take place          that side     the       on                        of
membrane             on
                    which was situated the fluid which passed
through        most slowly, although
              it                            density may     itsless than                    be
the other; thus, for instance, when             bladder full      aair                               of        is
surrounded with carbonic acid, the latter enters faster than
the former escapes, and the bladder bursts.            Now         found                        it   is
 by  experiment, that carbonic acid passes through wet mem
brane quicker than atmospheric air, although                     greater                  of    a
 density.
     In such instances the relative velocities           the passage            of                             of

 Lenes), as opposed to         f  v, p. 8, x, y, a , º, which are called
aspirate sounds (or Aspirates).          This division is as old as the
 time of the classical grammarians, and is generally recognised.
 Hence the division,--
                        Lene.                   Aspirate.
                      p   .    b                Jº     v
                      t    .   d                 p     8

                      S    •   2                 a     &
    By the side of this should be placed the division of sounds
 into what is called explosive and continuous.            If we isolate the
 sound of    p’  as much as    possible,  so as to  join  with it no vowel
 whatsoever, we find that the articulation is only of a momen
 tary duration, “taking place during a sudden change in the
 conformation of the mouth, and not capable of prolongation.”
 (Müller's Physiology, Baly's translation, p. 1045.) The same
 is the case with the sounds of b, t, d, k, g.
     In contrast to this we may isolate such a sound as f*. Here
 the sound can be “prolonged, ad libitum, as long as a parti
  cular disposition of the mouth and a constant expiration are
  maintained” (Ibid.).
     It is upon these differences that the names earplosive (stre
 pitus incontinuus explosivus) and continuous (strepitus continuus)
  are given by even the earlier writers upon these subjects; and,

undoubtedly, they may with great propriety and convenience
be retained.
   Now the divisions into lene and aspirate and the divisions
into explosive and continuous more or less coincide.          Besides
the vowels,   semivowels,  and  liquids,  all the aspirates  are con
tinuous; and nearly       the lenes (p,           all                                b,              g)

It   is almost doubtful whether it be convenient or not to call
 this sound an articulation.    However, it enters into the con
 stitution of speech, and is expressed in English by the letter h.
    A sound equally simple may be formed by drawing in a
 breath, when the sound is formed by a current of air passing
Jrom the mouth to the lungs. This is the sound of h formed
 by means of an inspiration.      The existence of this sound in
 speech is problematical.    In some of the Hottentot languages
 described as containing, amongst their fundamental sounds,
 inarticulate clicks and catches, it may possibly exist.
     By breathing an expiration through the nose instead of
 through the mouth, we may form a nasal variation of h.
     By drawing a breath through the nose, instead of through
 the mouth, we may form a nasal variation of the second
 sound.
     Hence, of even the simplest breathing, there are four pos
 sible forms.
     I. Oral, where the breath passes through the mouth.
            a. The breath expired = h.
            b. The breath inspired.
      II. Nasal, where the current    breath passes through the
                                                        of

other various aetherial spirits, much after the manner that air
is compounded of the phlegmatic body of air intermixed with
various vapours and exhalations.       For the electric and mag
netic  effluvia, and the  gravitating   principle, seem to argue
such  variety.   Perhaps  the whole frame of nature may be no
thing but various contextures of some certain aetherial spirits
or vapours, condensed as it were by precipitation, much after
the manner that vapours are condensed into water, or exhala
tions into grosser substances, though not as easily condensable,
and after condensation wrought into various forms, at first by
the immediate hand of the Creator, and ever since by the
power of nature, which, by virtue of the command increase
and multiply, became a complete imitator of the copy set her
by the Protoplast.     Thus perhaps may            things     origi                all                       be

then leaping up, and perhaps down and up again, and this

a much greater height than the surface               of the stagnating wa
ter into which they are dipped          +.  So    I suppose aether, though
it pervades the pores of crystal, glass, water, and other na
tural bodies, yet it stands at a greater degree of rarity in those
pores than in the free aetherial spaces, and at so much greater
a degree of rarity as the pores of the body are smaller.
Whence it may be that spirit of wine, for instance, though a
lighter body, yet having subtiler parts, and consequently
smaller pores than water, is the more strongly refracting
liquor. This also may be the principal cause of the cohesion
 of the parts of solids and fluids, of the springiness of glass
and other bodies whose parts slide not one upon another in
 bending, and of the standing of the mercury in the Torricel
 lian experiment, sometimes to the top of the glass, though a
 much greater height than twenty-nine inches.                 For the denser
 aether which surrounds these bodies must crowd and press
 their parts together, much after the manner that air surround
 ing two marbles presses them together if there be little or no
 air between them. Yea, and that puzzling problem, by what
 means the muscles are contracted and dilated to cause animal
 motion, may receive greater light from hence than from any other
 means men have hitherto been thinking on. For if there be any
 power in man to condense and dilate at will the aether that
 pervades the muscle, that condensation or dilatation must vary
  the compression of the muscle made by the ambient aether,
 and cause it to swell, or shrink, accordingly; for though
     * The imprinted paper of “Observations” which accompanied this, and
  which was the first form of the “Optics,” contained a passage on the pre
  sent subject, omitted in that publication, which deserves to be quoted for
  the acknowledgment it contains of the merit of Hook.        In the third prop.
  of the second   book,  Newton remarks:– “To the increase of the opacity of
  these bodies it conduces something, that by the 23rd observation, the re
  flexion of thin transparent substances are considerably stronger than those
  made by the same substances of a greater thickness.” Here the paper sub
 joins,—“And to the reflexion of solid bodies it may be further added, that
  the interstices of their parts are void of air.   For that for the most part
  they are so is reasonable to believe, considering the inaptitude which air
  hath to pervade small cavities, as appears by the ascension of water in slen
  der glass pipes, paper, cloth, and other such like substances, whose pores
  are found too small to be replenished with air, and yet large enough to
  admit water, and by the difficulty wherewith air pervades the pores of a
  bladder, through which water finds ready passage.       And according to the
   11th observation, the cavities thus void of air will cause the same kind of
  effect, as to reflexion, which those do that are replenished with it; but yet
  something more manifestly, because the medium in relation to refractions
  is rarest when most empty of air, as Mr. Hook hath proved in his Mico
  graphia, in which book he hath also largely discoursed of this and the pre
  cedent proposition, and delivered many other very excellent, things con
  cerning the colour of thin plates, and other natural bodies, which I have
  not scrupled to make use of as far as they were for my purpose.”

    Fifthly, it is to be supposed that light and aether mutually
act upon one another, aether in refracting light, and light in
 warming aether, and that the densest aether acts most strongly.
 When a ray therefore moves through aether of uneven den
 sity, I suppose it is most pressed, urged, or acted upon by the
 medium on that side towards the denser aether, and receives
a continual impulse or ply from that side to recede towards
the rarer, and so is accelerated if it move that way, or re
tarded if the contrary.          On this ground, if a ray move ob

 ifa refracted ray (as n L) be made incident, the incident

 A p. v, after it is arrived at v, where suppose it parallel to the
refracting superficies, should be reflected perpendicularly
back, it would return back in the line of incidence v u A;
therefore going forward, it must go forward in such another
line v ºr A, both cases being alike, and so be reflected at an
angle equal to that of incidence.
    This may be the cause and manner of reflexion, when light
tends from the rarer towards the denser aether; but to know
how it should be reflected when it tends from the denser to
wards the rarer, you are farther to consider, how fluids near
their superficies are less pliant and yielding than in their more

tend out        of the rarer medium into the denser; and in that
case therefore the reflexion having a double cause ought to be
stronger than in the aether, as it is apparently.  But in refrac
tion this rigid tenacity or unpliableness of the superficies need
not be considered, because so much as the ray is thereby bent
in passing to the most tenacious and rigid part of the superfi
cies, so much is it thereby unbent again in passing on from
thence through the next parts gradually less tenacious.
   Thus may rays be refracted by some superficies and                                                             re
flected by others, be the medium they tend into denser or
rarer. But it remains further to be explained, how rays alike
incident on the same superficies (suppose of crystal, glass or
water), may be at the same time, some refracted, others re
flected; and for explaining this,                         I
                                          suppose that the rays when
they impinge on the rigid resisting aetherial superficies, as they

which such a subtle agent as light can shake the gross parti

    But        to

ought always            appear after the manner described, were light
                       to
uniform.        And after that manner, when the two contiguous
glasses    A
           Q          and   A    R    have been illustrated                           in   a   dark room

 208           Newton's Letters, Hypothesis and Experiments
  by light of any uniform colour made by a prism,              Ihave seen
  the lucid circles   appear   to about   twenty  in number,   with many
  dark ones between         them,  the colour of the lucid ones being
  that of the light with which the glasses were illustrated. And
  if the glasses were held between the eye and the prismatic co
  lours cast on a sheet of white paper, or if any prismatic colour
  was directly trajected through the glasses to a sheet of paper
  placed a little way behind, there would appear such other
   rings of colour and darkness (in the first case between the
  glasses, in the second on the paper) oppositely corresponding
  to those which appeared by reflexion.          I   mean that whereas
     j
  by reflected light there appeared a black spot in the middle,
   and then a coloured circle; on the contrary, by transmitted
  light, there appeared a coloured spot in the middle, then a
  black circle; and so on, the diameters of the coloured circles
  made by transmission equalling the diameters of the black
   .
  ones made by reflexion.
      Thus, I say the rings do and ought to appear when made
  by uniform light, but in compound light it is otherwise. For
   the rays           exhibit red and yellow, exciting, as I said,
  larger pulses in the aether than those which make blue and
          and consequently making bigger circles in a certain
  proportion, as I have manifoldly found they do, by illumina
  ting the glasses successively by the aforesaid colours of the
  prism in a well-darkened room, without changing the position
  of my eye or of the glasses; hence the circles made by illumina
  ting the glasses with white light, ought not to appear black and
  white by turns, as the circles made by illustrating the glasses
  for instance with red light, appear red and black; but the co
  lours which compound the white light must display themselves
  by being reflected, the blue and violet nearer to the centre
  than the red and yellow, whereby every lucid circle must be
  come violet in the inward verge, red in the outward, and of
  intermediate colours in the intermediate parts, and be made
  broader than before, spreading        itscolours both ways into those
  spaces which      I  call the black rings, and which would here

    210        Newton's Letters, Hypothesis and Experiments
    so on; yea the colours of every ring must spread themselves
    something more both ways than is here represented, because
    the quadrantal arcs here described represent not the verges,
    but the middle of the rings made in a dark room by the ex
    treme violet and red; the violet falling on both sides the pricked
    arches, and red on both sides the black line arches.                And
    hence it is that these     rings  or circuits of colours succeed one
    another continually without any intervening black, and that
    the colours are pure only in the three or four first rings, and
    then interfering and mixing more and more, dilute one another
    so much, that after eight or nine rings they are no more to be
    distinguished, but seem to constitute an even whiteness;
    whereas when they were made in a dark room, by one of the
    prismatic colours alone, I have, as I said, seen above twenty
    of them, and without doubt could have seen them to a greater
    number, had           I
                        taken the pains to make the prismatic colour
    more uncompounded.            For by unfolding these rings from one
    another    by  certain refractions expressed in the other papers”
    I  send   you, I have even in daylight discovered them to above
    a hundred, and perhaps they would have appeared innumera
    ble, had the light or colour illustrating the glasses been ab
    solutely uncompounded, and the pupil of my eye but a ma
    thematical point, so that                   all
                                         the rays which came from the

                              to         What has been hitherto said                              of

    obliquely you look upon the glass the larger the rings appear.

bodies whatever seem to depend on nothing but the various
sizes and densities of the particles, as I think you have seen
described by me more at large in another paper.                       If the par
ticles be   very  small (as are those of          salts,  vitriols,  and gums),
they are transparent; and as they are supposed bigger and
bigger, they put on these colours in order, black, white, yel
low, red; violet, blue, pale green, yellow, orange, red; pur
ple, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, &c., as it is discerned by
the colours, which appear at the several thicknesses of very
thin plates of transparent bodies. Whence, to know the causes
of the changes of colours, which are often made by the mix
tures of several liquors, it is to be considered how the parti
cles of any tincture may have their size or density altered by
the infusion of another liquor.                When any metal is put into

 abounding with particles, to which the former saline particles
 are more sociable than to the particles of the metal (suppose
 with particles of salt of tartar), then so soon as they strike on
 one another in the liquor, the saline particles will adhere to
 those more firmly than to the metalline ones, and by degrees
 be wrought off from those to enclose these. Suppose A a me
 talline particle, inclosed with saline ones of spirit of nitre, E
 a particle of salt of tartar, contiguous to two of the particles
 of spirit of nitre, b and c; and suppose the particle E is im
 pelled by any motion towards d, so as to roll
 about the particle c till it touch the particle d,             Fig. 4.
 the   particle  b adhering   more     firmly  to E than
 to A, will be forced off from A; and by the
 same means the particle E, as it rolls about A,
 will tear off the rest of the saline particles from
 A one after another, till it has got them all, or
 almost all, about itself. And when the metallic

are reduced back into water, unless the heat, which keeps
them in agitation, be so great as to dissipate them as fast as
they come together; but the grosser particles of exhalations
raised by fermentation keep their acrial form more obstinately,
because the aether within is rarer.
   Nor does the size only, but the density of the particles also,
conduce to the permanency of aerial substances; for the ex
cess of density of the aether without such particles above that
of the aether within them is still greater; which has made me
sometimes think that the true permanent air may be of a me
tallic original; the particles of no substances being more
dense than those of metals.         This, I think, is also favoured
by experience, for I remember                   I

the air made by dissolving salt of tartar would in two or three
days’ time condense and fall down again, but the air made by
dissolving a metal continued without condensing or relenting
in the least.    If you consider then, how by the continual fer
mentations made in the bowels of the earth there are aerial
substances raised out of            all
                                 kinds     bodies,

I     shall set down one conjecture more, which came into my

                I  was writing this letter;        about the cause

the  regions  of the air; and that yet the grosser aether in the
air affects the upper regions of the earth, and the finer aether
in the earth the lower regions of the air, in such a manner,
that from the top of the air to the surface of the earth, and
again from the surface of the earth to the centre thereof, the
aether is insensibly finer and finer.     Imagine now any body
suspended in the air, or lying on the earth, and the aether

upper parts of the body, than in those which are in           lower                    its

the angle contained by their directions, and is never greater
than their sum.
   Let the forces P, Q, R, acting upon the point O in the
directions OP, OQ, OR, be in equi
librium, so that R, acting in the oppo

R OP, and PO Q by 2, 3, and y.
Make ~ R O'Q' = < ROQ = a, and

a force P’ = P; in O Q', a force

Q'-   Q; and in OR, a force          R;                       R/-
hence the forces P, Q, R' are respectively equal to P, Q, R,
and the angles contained by the directions of the former forces
are equal to those contained by the directions of the latter;
now P, Q, R are in equilibrium, hence P, Q, R' are also in
equilibrium; wherefore the forces P, P, Q, Q', and R + R',
 whose directions are OP, OP', O Q, O Q', and OR, must
balance each other, and consequently the resultant of the first
four forces must be equal and opposite to R+ R!.
    Moreover, since <U+2192> R O P = <            = 3, RO (produced,          ROP
if necessary)  will bisect the angle POP";  hence the resultant
 R, of the equal forces P and P' will act in RO, and R, will
 be a function of P and 3; now, since the numerical values of
 R, and P vary with the unit of force, and that of 3 is inde

Elements of Physics.            By C. F. PEscHEL, Principal of the Royal
    Military Academy at Dresden.              Translated from the German, with
   notes, by E. WEST.          3 vols. foolscap octavo.
      HIS   is a work of great merit.           It contains a condensed account
         of almost     every branch of the extensive subject on which it
treats, with the most approved formulae, conveniently arranged, for
computing in every department, and it is copiously illustrated with
woodcuts.
    The first volume treats of the properties of ponderable bodies,
mass, density, attraction, motion, mechanical and chemical action, &c.;
the construction of machines, the laws of force, the theory of undu
lation, and a multitude of other subjects connected with matter
having sensible weight, and all discussed with an ability which leaves
little to be desired in a work which, though essentially scientific, is
yet decidedly popular.                                -
    We should have been glad to see from the author, or the trans
lator, a chapter on the measurement of heights from the temperature
of boiling water, a subject which we think has not received the at
tention which it is entitled to.
    The second and third volumes, that of imponderable bodies—light,
heat, electricity, magnetism, &c.; and here again we trace the hand
of a master, who has placed before his readers, in the most lucid
order, those branches of science in their modern improved state.
    The work is a little encyclopædia of physical science, and we
heartily recommend it as a work by which the public will benefit.

           On the Diminution   of Brightness in 6   Ursae   Minoris.
    Extract of a letter from Sir J. F. W. Herschel to the Presi
                                                                          º
dent:—
     Allow me to call your attention to the remarkable diminution
which has taken place in the apparent brightness of 3 Ursae Mino
ris since 1840 and 1841. In the course of a series of observations
which I carried on in those years, on the comparative brightness of
the stars, the star in question was always ranked above Polaris, and
far above 6 Ursae Majoris and & Coronae.         To the last-named star it
is still  superior, and  perhaps  a little (but very  little) to the former;
 but with Polaris it will bear no comparison.        That the change is in
 8, and not in Polaris, is evident. The latter retains its rank; it re
 mains (as    I  have  always observed     it) much inferior to a,       e, and
 7, Ursae  Majoris; but when compared with 4, there is some doubt.
 I incline to place it a little higher in the scale than that star; and I
find on consulting my lists, that on the 30th April, 1840, it was
judged then also superior to &, but that on the next night this order
 was reversed; proving that then, as now, a difficulty existed in de
 ciding the relative claims of the two stars to superiority.
     6 Ursae Minoris must therefore clearly claim a place among the
 slowly variable stars, a class of especial interest; and I hope this
 notice may suffice to induce some of our astronomical fraternity to
 keep an eye on its future progress.
     On the Double Stars, 3 Cygni, y Leonis, &c. By J. R. Hind,
Esq.
     In 1783 Sir W. Herschel estimated the distance of the stars of
 8 Cygni to   be nearly 2"5; in 1802 and 1804 he could not see the
 companion at all. It was rediscovered in 1826 by M. Struve, who
 found the distance to be nearly 2", whence he conjectured the pe
 riodic time was about 40 years. This guess was, however, contra
 dicted by subsequent observations; and M. Struve now accounts for
 the anomalous disappearance by supposing the light of the smaller
 star to be variable.     Mr. Hind has computed two orbits which sa
 tisfy the observations pretty well, and which nearly agree, except in
 the node and inclination.        The method of calculation is that de
 scribed   by Sir J. F. W. Herschel in the Memoirs of the Astronomi
 cal Society, vol. v. p. 17.1, &c. Though these elements are only
 approximate, yet they give a general idea of the form of the orbit.
 The periodic time is about 180 years.
     By the same mode of calculation, Mr. Hind has obtained a first
 approximation to the orbit of y Leonis, with a periodic time of nearly

                                 Royal Astronomical Society.                                                      231
300 years. As the angle of position has only altered 24° in 63 years                                                3.
the result is rather uncertain.
    Mr. Hind points out several double stars which are promising
subjects for investigation; & Scorpii, 12 Lyncis, & Aquarii, 36 An
dromedae, 85 Persei, ) Tauri, v' Cancri, a Ursae Majoris, 157 Lyncis,
49 Serpentis, 0 Draconis, and X 460, 520, 1126, 1457, 1757, 1819,
2107, 2120, 2438.       He conceives that : Scorpii probably revolves in
a very elongated ellipse.                      -
    Suggestions for Improving the Manufacture of Optical Glass. By
James Nasmyth, Esq.
    Mr. Nasmyth, after remarking, for our encouragement, that the
problem is possible, since large discs of homogeneous glass are made
elsewhere, expresses his conviction that the proper materials in suf
ficient purity are at our command, and that the difficulty is in the
mode of effecting perfect combination and vitrification.
    He proposes to carry the heat of the furnace to the highest prac
ticable degree, thus ensuring perfect fusion and fluidity, and then, by
maintaining the heat for a considerable time, to give the particles
time to arrange themselves in their order of density. He would then
lower the heat so gradually as to avoid disturbing their arrangement,
but not so slowly as to endanger            vitreous quality. The melting
                                                             its
pots should        cylindrical

In  this way Mr. Nasmyth conceives that discs nearly homogeneous
would     be
           procured, and       any rate that the density would

through each horizontal section, which perhaps would                   sufficient                  be
for optical purposes.         there   If any tendency   be     unite     definite       to          in

   Without venturing           give    positive opinion

 When the causes of error in measuring an angle, terrestrial or ce
 lestial, are separately considered, the sum of the errors of division
  and of reading off will in some cases be much larger than the error
  of bisecting the object or of reading off the level. Whenever this is
 so, then, supposing no fresh error to be introduced, the repeating
 principle may be advantageously applied, since the errors of division
 and reading off are divided by the whole number of observations,
 and not by the square root of the number, as is the case in non-re
 peaters.
     The defect most to be feared in repeating instruments is the slip
 ping of a part which should be fixed while another part is moved.
 This may probably be avoided in the repeating stand for a theodolite,
 by making the lower motion exceedingly heavy while the upper mo
 tion is exquisitely light, and by affixing the clamp of the stand at as
 large a distance as may be from the centre of motion.                  By measu
 ring the angle twice over, first moving the theodolite and stand the
 same way, and again moving them the contrary way, any error from
 slipping will be detected.         The coincidence of results by the two
 methods will be a satisfactory test of their truth.
     When the repetition is in altitude, the level, if attached to the

  June 23, 1846.-Professor Owen read a Memoir (Part II.) on the
Dinornis, descriptive of parts of the skeleton transmitted from New
Zealand since the reading of Part I. (Annals, vol. xiv. p. 59.)
  The bones referable to species defined in that communication
were first described. Among these were the cranial portion of the
skull of Dinornis struthoides and a corresponding portion of the skull
of Dinornis dromioides, which in general form more resembled that
part of the skull of the Dodo than of any existing bird; but they are
remarkable for the great breadth of a low occipital region, which
 slopes from below upwards and forwards; the almost flat parietal
region is continued directly forwards into the broad sloping frontal
 region; the temporal fossae are remarkably wide and deep; the orbits
 small; the olfactory chamber expanded posteriorly, but not to so
 great an extent as in the Apteryx; the plane of the foramen mag
 num is vertical.    Many other characteristics in the cranial organi
 zation of the genus Dinornis were described, and the specific distinc
tion of the two mutilated crania pointed out.
    The tympanic bone of the Dinornis giganteus was described in
detail and compared with the same bone in existing birds.
    Different cervical and dorsal vertebrae, referable to the species
 Din. giganteus, ingens, struthoides and crassus, were described. These
vertebrae were remarkably entire, and with some of the best-preserved
bones of the extremities, described in a subsequent part of the Me
moir, had been obtained from a turbary formation on the coast of the
Middle Island, near Waikawaite.
    One of the most interesting of the novel acquisitions from this
locality was an almost entire sternum, referred by Prof. Owen to the
Din. giganteus.     It is a subquadrate, keel-less, shield-shaped bone,
broader than long, with the posterior angles and the xiphoid process
prolonged, as in the Apteryx, but without the anterior emargination.
The coracoid depressions very small. This bone was minutely de
scribed and compared with the keel-less sternums of the existing
Struthious birds; that of the Apteryx being demonstrated to be most
like the sternum of Dinornis.
    The following bones of the extremities, imperfectly or not at                            all
known   in  1843, were next described :—

Trans. vol. iii. pp. 252, 264). The tarso-metatarsus also shows the
rough elliptical surface for the attachment of the back-toe, indicating
the Din. dromioides to belong to the same generic or subgeneric sec
tion as Din. ingens from the North Island.
    Femora, tibiae and tarso-metatarsi, from the Middle Island, were
next exhibited and described, which establish a new species, for
which Prof. Owen proposed the name of Din. casuarinus : a small
and feeble depression, five lines by three lines, indicates that this
species had a back-toe in the corresponding position with that in the
Apteryx, but more rudimental.
    A very remarkable femur and tarso-metatarsal bone, also from
the Middle Island, were exhibited, belonging to an additional tri
dactyle species, to which the name of Dinornis crassus was given.
Of this species the author remarks: “With a stature nearly equal to
that of the Ostrich, the femur and tarso-metatarsus present double
the thickness in proportion to their length.      It must have been the
strongest and most robust of birds, and the best representative of
the pachydermal type in the feathered class.”
    The third new species is comparatively a small one, being inter
mediate in size between the Dinornis didiformis and the Din. otidi
formis; it was founded on remains exclusively from the North Island,
and was called by the author Dinornis curtus.
    The paper (which was illustrated by numerous figures) concluded
by some general comparisons and remarks on the geographical
distribution of the different species of Dinornis.
    July 14, 1846. —Prof. Owen communicated, as an “Appendix to
his Memoir on the Dinornis,’ some observations on the skull and on
 the osteology of the foot of the Dodo (Didus ineptus).
    After a brief summary of the history of this remarkable extinct
brevipennate Bird, in which the reduced highly finished figure by
 Savery, in his famous painting of “Orpheus charming the Beasts,’
 now in the collection at the Hague, was particularly noticed; and
 the recent discovery of the skull of the Dodo amongst some old spe
 cimens in the Museum of Natural History at Copenhagen was men
 tioned, he proceeded to demonstrate the peculiarities of the Dodo's
 skull, by a comparison of the cast of the head of the bird in the Ash
 molean Museum at Oxford with those of other recent and extinct
 species of Birds.
    The Dodo's skull differs from that of any species of Vulturidae, or
 any Raptorial Bird, in the greater elevation of the frontal bones above
 the cerebral hemispheres, and in the sudden sinking of the inter
 orbital and nasal region of the forehead; in the rapid compression
 of the beak anterior to the orbits; in the elongation of the compressed
 mandibles, and in the depth and direction of the sloping symphysis
 of the lower jaw. The eyes of the Dodo are very small compared
 with those of the Vulturidae or other Raptores. The nostrils, it is
 true, pierce the cere, but are more advanced in position; this how
 ever seems essentially to depend upon the excessive elongation of
 the basal part of the upper mandible before the commencement of the
 uncinated extremity; the nostrils are pierced near the commence

ment of this uncinated part as in the Vulturidae, but are nearer the-
lower border of the mandible in the Dodo.
     The resemblance between the skull of the Dodo and that of the
Albatros is chiefly in the compression and prolongation of the curved
mandibles: there are no traces in the Dodo of the hexagonal space
on the upper surface of the cranium of the Albatros, so well defined
there by the two supra-occipital ridges behind, the two temporal ridges
at the sides, and the two converging posterior boundaries of the supra
orbital glandular fossae in front.           There is no sudden depression of
the frontal    region  in the skull of the Albatros; the nostrils are near
the    upper  surface of the basal third of the beak in the Albatros; and
the Dodo's cranium is thrice as broad in proportion to the breadth
of the mid-part of the mandible as in that of the Albatros.
     More satisfactory evidence of the affinities of the Dodo was ob
tained from a comparison of the bones of the foot, which have recently
been very skilfully and judiciously exposed by the able Curator of
 the Ashmolean Museum.
     The tarso-metatarsal bone most resembles in its thickness and
 general proportions that of the Eagles, especially the great Sea
 Eagles (Haliaëtus); it is much stronger than the tarso-metatarsus of
 any of the Vulturida, or than that of the Cock, the Craw, or any of
 the Gallinae or existing Struthionidae; the stronger-footed species of
 Dinornis most resemble it in the general proportions of the tarso
 metatarsus, but greatly differ in the particular configuration of the
 bone, and in the absence, or feebler indication, as in the subgenus
 Palapterya, of the articulation for the metatarsal bone of the back
 toe. The relative size of this bone is greater in the Dodo than in
 any other known bird.           The Eagles make the nearest approach to
 it in this  respect;    as also in the shape of the hinder supplemental

    “My Lords          and Gentlemen        the Royal Irish Academy,   of
Although          it   is,
                       believe, well known
                          I                   most, perhaps  all,   you,    to                                    to         of
that     it   has been for   considerable time my wish and intention
                                          a                                                                                               to

 retire this evening from the Chair to which, in 1837, your kindness
 called me, on the still lamented event of the death of my distin
 guished predecessor, the late admirable Dr. Lloyd, and in which
 your continuing confidence has since replaced me on eight successive
 occasions, yet a few parting words from me may be allowed, perhaps
 expected; and I should wish to offer them, were it only to guard
 against the possibility of any one's supposing that I look upon my
 thus retiring from your Chair as a step unimportant to myself, or as
 one which might be taken by me with indifference, or without de
 liberation.   It was under no hasty impulse that I resolved to retire
 from the office of your President into the ranks of your private
members, nor was it lightly that I determined to lay down the
highest honour of my life.
    “My reasons have been stated in an Address delivered in another
place, at a meeting of some members of your body. They are,
                                                            I
briefly, these: that after the expiration of several years, have found
 the duties of the office press too heavily upon my energies, indeed,
of late, upon my health, when combined with other duties; and that
 I have felt the anxieties of a concentrated responsibility—exagge
rated, perhaps, by an ardent or excitable temperament—tend more
to distract my thoughts from the calm pursuits of study, than can  I
judge to be desirable or right in itself, or consistent with the full re
deeming of those pledges which I may be considered to have long
since given, as an early Contributor to your Transactions.
             I
    “When look back on the aspirations with which first I entered
on that office from which I am now about to retire, it humbles me
to reflect how far short I have come of realizing my own ideal; but
it cheers me to remember how greatly beyond what I could then
have ventured to anticipate, the Academy itself has flourished.       Of
this result I may speak with little fear, because little is attributable
to myself.     Gladly do I acknowledge that it has been my good for
tune, rather than my merit, to have presided over your body during a
period in which, through the exertions of others much more than
through my own (though mine, too, have not been withheld), the
Academy is generally felt to have prospered in all its departments.
The original papers which have been read; the volumes of Trans
actions which have been published; the closer communication which
has been established with kindred societies of our own and of foreign
countries; the enhanced value of our Library and Museum, which
have been, at least, as much enriched in the quality as in the quantity
of their contents; the improved state (as it is represented to me) of
our finances, combined with an increased strength of our claims on
public and parliamentary support; the heightened interest of members
and visiters in our meetings, which have been honoured on four
occasions, during my presidency, by the presence of representatives
of Royalty; even the convenience and appropriate adornment of the
rooms in which we assemble;—all these are things, and others might
be named, in which, however small may have been the share of him
who now addresses you, the progress of the Academy has not been
small, and of which the recollection tends to console one who may,

238            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
at least, be allowed to call himself an attached member of the body,
under the sense, very deeply felt by him, of his own personal and
official deficiencies.
    “Whoever may be the member elected by your suffrages, this
evening, to occupy that important and honourable post which I am
now about to resign, it will, of course, become my duty to give to
that future President my faithful and cordial support, by any means
within the compass of my humble power. But if it be true, as I
collect it to be, that your unanimous choice will fall upon the very
member whom, out of all others, I should have myself selected, if it
could have been mine to make the selection—with whom I have
been long connected by the closest ties of College friendship,
strengthened by the earnest sympathy which we have felt in our
aspirations for the welfare of this Academy, which has already bene
fited by his exertions in many and important ways—then will that
course, which would have been in any event my duty, be in an
eminent degree my pleasure also.
    “And now, my Lords and Gentlemen, understanding that an old
and respected member is prepared to propose for your votes, as my
successor, the friend to whom I have ventured to allude—very in
adequately, as regards my opinion of his merits, yet, perhaps, more
pointedly than his modesty will entirely forgive or approve of,       I
shall detain you no longer from that stage of the proceedings of the
evening which must be the most interesting to all of us, but shall
conclude these words of farewell from this Chair, by expressing a
hope that my future exertions, though in a less conspicuous position,
shall manifest, at least in some degree, that grateful and affectionate
sense which I must ever retain of the constant confidence and favour
which you have, at all times, shown towards me.”
    After which it was Resolved,—That the thanks of the Academy be
given to Sir William R. Hamilton, and that the Academy desire to
express their entire sense of the value of his services as President,
of his high and impartial bearing in the Chair, and of his untiring
efforts to advance the interests of the body; and they also wish to
record their satisfaction that he has determined to remain in the
Council of the Academy.
   The following officers were then elected:—The Rev. Prof. Lloyd,
President, in the place of Sir William Hamilton; Dr. Todd, Secre
tary; the Rev. Charles Graves, Secretary of Council; and the Rev.
Mr. Butcher, Secretary of Foreign Correspondence; in the rooms
respectively of Dr. MacCullagh, and Sir Robert Kane, resigned, and
of the Rev. Dr. Lloyd, who was      elected President.

  ANALYSIS OF A CALCAREOUS ROCK ON WHICH FUCI AND WA
                RECHS VEGETATE,        BY M. LASSAIGN.E.
Tº:        rocks on which these substances grow on a part of the
       western shore of France, are covered daily with the water of the

                   Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                                       239
ocean. In order to examine the nature of these rocks, some frag
ments were detached from the surface, to which several of the ma
rine plants remained attached.
   The substance which constitutes these rocks possesses consider
able cohesion; externally it is yellowish-white, and internally chalk
white.      When dried in the air, it has the appearance of moderately
hard   chalk,   and is friable.      Its porosity having occasioned the ab
sorption of a small quantity of sea-water, it retained a portion of its
salts; superficially this rock has a saline taste, which does not exist
at the depth of about one inch and a half to two inches.
    The unquestionable existence of iodine, in the state of iodide of
sodium in the greater part of marine plants, and                       absence from      its
sea-water,       asproved by the experiments made by M. Gualtier                                                   de
Claubry     in  1813, and those since published by Davy, induced the
author    to  search for this element                  in
                                                  the rock                       on

grow.

 entirely from a solution, even when very dilute, and notwithstanding
 an excess of ammonia and the absence of ammoniacal salts, provided
 a considerable time is allowed to elapse between that of the preci
 pitation and filtration.
    Lastly, alumina may be precipitated immediately and completely
 by sulphuret of ammonium, even when the solution is very dilute
 and no ammoniacal salts are present.
    The authors observe that nothing is more easy than to show the
 great solubility of alumina in solution of ammonia, and the very
 strongly marked precipitating power of sulphuret of ammonium.
Prepare two solutions, one of 2 grammes of ammoniacal alum in
 50 grammes of water, and the other of 2 grammes of the same salt
in 200 grammes of water, and let the same volume of solution of
ammonia, say 15 cubic centimetres, be poured into both solutions,
it will be seen that the precipitate produced in the solution, the total
volume of which is 65 cubic centimetres, is incomparably greater
than that produced in the solution the volume of which is 215.                    It
is sufficient to filter the most bulky solution, to divide into two equal
portions, and to expose one to ebullition and the other to a current
of sulphuretted hydrogen, to produce in both cases a considerable
precipitate of alumina.

  ON THE BIBASIC ARSENIATE OF AMMONIA AND MAGNESIA.
                     BY M. LEWOL.
   The author observes, that, notwithstanding the striking analogies
presented by arsenical and phosphoric compounds, it does not ap
pear to have been ascertained whether an arsenical compound exists,
corresponding to the most important of the ammoniaco-magnesian
double phosphates, or that which occurs among certain products of
animal organization, and which is so frequently employed in chemi
cal analyses, on account of its insolubility, to determine the quantity
of phosphoric acid.
   The author thought it would be interesting to determine if it were
possible to produce an arseniate analogous to this phosphate, and to
apply     it,   on
               account       its insolubility,

                                                 in         salt exists, and that   a

cerated during twelve hours in sulphuric aether, the action of which
was assisted by repeatedly shaking the vessel, and eventually heating
it to about 90°Fahr.
   After this reaction the aether was filtered and had acquired a
slight golden-yellow colour; it was introduced into a retort with a
small quantity of water, and distilled with a gentle heat. After the
distillation of the aether there remained a fluid resin of an amber
yellow colour, possessing the consistence and viscidity of common
turpentine, and part of it solidified on cooling.         The water in which
this resin floated was poured off, it was colourless and reddened                                         lit

rature, by placing under a glass with a vessel containing concentrated
sulphuric acid. The product of this evaporation was an inodorous
colourless mass, crystallized in small laminae, possessing first a bitter
and afterwards an acrid taste.
   This crystallized residue reddened litmus paper strongly,                aque                   its
ous solution yielded no precipitate with barytes water, but gave

ON THE     OCCURRENCE OF FLUOR SPAR, APATITE AND CHON
          DRODITE IN LIMESTONE, By JAMES D. D.A.N.A.
    The analyses of corals by Mr. B. Silliman, jun. *, have shown that
although ordinary corals consist mainly of carbonate of lime, there is
present a small proportion of phosphates and fluorides, with some
silica, alumina and oxide of iron.     It is also probable, from some
trials by Mr. Silliman, that these constituents exist also in many
shells.
    From the results obtained in these analyses, it appears that the
fluorides and phosphates amount, on an average, to about # per cent.,
or 0.25 part in a hundred parts of coral; and the amount in the
same manner of the phosphates, is 0.05 per cent.      A cubic foot of
coral, as deduced from the average specific gravity ascertained by
Mr. Silliman, weighs 157 pounds. Consequently in each cubic foot
there are 6} ounces of fluorides and 1+ ounce of phosphates; in
each cubic rod, 1700 pounds of fluorides and 340 pounds of phos
phates. These fluorides are fluorides of calcium and magnesium,
and the phosphates are phosphates of lime and magnesia.         In the
same manner we ascertain that the amount of fluorides in a reef of
coral, a mile long, half a mile wide and a hundred feet deep, amounts
to more than 500,000,000 pounds. The proportion of silica is a
little less than that of the fluorides.
    Late geological researches have placed it beyond doubt, that the
various limestones consist mainly, like coral limestone, of animal
remains, among which corals in many instances hold a conspicuous
place. These limestones often contain crystallizations of fluoride of
calcium (fluor spar); and in other beds which have evidently been
acted upon and crystallized by heat, there are also apatite (phosphate
of lime) and chondrodite (composed of fluoric acid, magnesia and
silica). Moreover     these    are the most common minerals of these
limestones.
   The above deductions supply us with a full explanation of the
origin of these minerals.     The fluorine, phosphoric acid, lime, mag
nesia and silica present, are adequate for all the results, without
looking to any other sources. Instead therefore of being extraneous
minerals introduced into the limestone rock, their elements at least
are an essential part of      itsconstitution; and they have been sepa
rated from the general mass          by
                                      a  segregation     of
                                                          like atoms under
well-known principles, and      it may    bearranged anew,            in
                                                                some cases,
according   to their affinities.   Fluoride     ofcalcium may crystallize
out when under water without much              or
                                                any heat; and              itis   an   in
teresting fact, that this fluoride has been lately proved           Mr.     by         G.
Wilson,   to   besoluble  to  some degree       inpure cold watert.    Mr.
 G. Wilson has also shown that fluorides actually exist          sea-water,

chondrodite require heat, as they are found only in granular lime

XLI.     On the Magnetic Affection of Light, and on the          Di
   stinction between the Ferromagnetic and Diamagnetic Con
   ditions of Matter. By Michael FARADAY, F.R.S., Foreign
   Associate of the Academy of Sciences, &c.
                        [Continued from p. 156.]
       AVING     ascertained the great advantage which this form
 | |     of apparatus possessed      for the examination of many
substances which would        give  no sensible results by the pro
cess   I formerly described,    I proceeded to apply it to the cases
of air and some doubly refracting bodies (Experimental Re
searches, 2237).       For this purpose I made the faces of the
magnetic poles reflectors, by applying to each a polished plate
of steel; and as the poles were moveable, their reflecting sur
faces could be placed at any distance and in any position re
quired, the substance experimented on being between them.
   Air.—I could obtain no signs of action upon the ray when
air was between the magnetic poles, even with the fourth, fifth
and sixth images.
    Rock-crystal.—The cubes of this substance formerly de
scribed (Experimental Researches, 21.78) were submitted to
examination; but      I  could detect no trace of action on the ray
of  light  when  passing   through them, although they were 0.75
of an inch in the   side,   and the ray was observed after passing
seven, and even nine times across them. The cubes were
examined in all directions.
   Iceland Spar.—A cube of this substance (Experimental
Researches, 2179) was examined in the same manner, but             I
obtained no effect.
            glass presented the expected phaenomena easily and
   flºw
Well.
    Failing to procure any positive result in these trials, either
with air or with doubly refracting crystals, I silvered the latter

in the manner that had been employed for the heavy glass,
that the magnetic poles might be brought as close as possible;
still no evidence of any magnetic action on the ray could be
observed.
    A natural six-sided prism of rock-crystal, 2-3 inches in
length, was polished and silvered at the ends: no magnetic
effect upon the light could be observed with this crystal with
either the first, second or third image.
    M. E. Becquerel thinks that he has observed an effect pro
duced in doubly refracting crystalline bodies; and it is pro
bable that his apparatus is far more delicate for the observance
of optical changes than mine. In that case, if combined with
the procedure founded on repeated transits of the ray, it per
haps would produce very distinct results: but the latter pro
cess alone has not as yet given any evidence of the action sought
a<U+017F>ter.
   Certain indications led me to look with interest for any
possible effect which the crossing of the reflected rays might
produce in the arrangement of reflectors and glass represented
in fig, 1 ; but I could find no difference of action between it
and the other arrangement, fig. 2, in which no such crossing
occurred.
  Near the close of last year I sent to the Royal Society
two papers On the Magnetic Condition of       Matter*,                   all
 which I   believed that     had established the existence of

differ from those which occur in all bodies, in this; that in
the first the distribution of magnetism is always in the direc
tion of the length, whilst in tritoxide of iron, wood, gum
lac, &c., it occurs generally in a transverse direction, espe
cially when they are formed into needles.                This difference of
effect is due to the       circumstance,     that the magnetism being
very weak in these bodies, we may neglect the reaction of
the particles of the bodies on themselves.” These words, and
the time of their publication (January 1846), sufficiently show
that M. Becquerel does not admit the new form or condition
of magnetic action, which I supposed I had previously de
monstrated.
     M. E. Becquerel, in a communication to the Academy of the
date of June 1846*, after confirming the action on light which
I   had announced, touches the question of magnetic action on
all   bodies; and        this late period

able in every respect to judge any question arising on such a
subject as magnetism, made me anxious on two accounts; for
      I
first, thought it possible                     I
                                 might really be in error respect
ing the broad and general principle of magnetic action, which
I  supposed I had discovered; and next, that if right on that
point, I must have been sadly deficient in describing my re
sults not to have conveyed a better impression to the minds of
those so competent to receive and understand.              therefore,                    I
for my own sake, entered into an examination of this point;
for though        I
                am nearly indifferent to the fate of any specula
tive or hypothetical     view              I
                                may venture to send forth, I am
far from being so as regards the correctness of any announce
ment   I may make of a law of action or a new fact; and having
carefully experimented on one or two of the cases of transverse
position assumed by certain bodies magnetic, as iron, I now
give the general result.
    Some good uniform peroxide of iron (being one of the sub
stances which M. Becquerel experimented with) was prepared
and introduced regularly into a thin glass tube, 0.25 of an
inch in diameter and 1.4 inch long; it was then suspended by
a long filament of cocoon silk, and could be brought into any
position relative to one of the poles of a strong electro-mag
net, which could be made to assume various forms by the use
of terminal pieces of iron. As peroxide of iron can occasion
ally receive and retain a feeble magnetic state, it is necessary
the experimenter should be aware of the possibility, and guard
against     its
             effect     producing irregular results.

 The same was the case with the former face

 of 2:5 inches. Either end of the cylinder of
 peroxide might be the end nearest to the face
 of the pole; but the centre of gravity of the
 cylinder was in every case attracted by the
 magnet.
    Other cylinders of peroxide of iron of
 different diameters and lengths were em
 ployed; and when they were smaller in
                                                                2.
 length than the opposed faces of the magnetic
 poles, the results were precisely the same.
    A cylinder of paper, magnetic through the
 presence of iron, was used and produced the
 same results.               -
    Having been led to think that the disaggregation of the
 peroxide of iron had considerable influence over these phae
 nomena, by obstructing and preventing the communication of
 magnetic induction from particle to particle, and was far
 more influential than the mere weakness of magnetic force,          I
 took some substances, even more weak in magnetic power
 than the peroxide, and formed them into cylinders.              The
substances were solution of     proto-sulphate   of  iron, muriate of
 cobalt and muriate of nickel, which were introduced into thin
glass tubes 0.25 of an inch in diameter and 1:4 inch long.
 These, when suspended before the poles with their centres
 of suspension in the axial line, did not act as the peroxide of
iron or the paper. They could indeed be kept in a position
 parallel to the face of the pole, but this was a position of un
 stable equilibrium; and when the least removed out of that
position, the end nearest the magnet continued to approach
 until it came in contact, and then the whole remained un
changed.      The action was precisely like that of a piece of
iron, but very inferior in energy.
    A saturated solution of proto-sulphate of iron was diluted
with five times      its
                     volume      water, and still showed precisely

the same phaenomena         the stronger solution: yet

M. E. Becquerel does not agree with me in the above expla
nation, but thinks it is due to this; that the particles of the
diamagnetic itself require time to assume their new state.
That they may require time                think, very probable.

                               Resolution          of Forces.                            259
the angle formed by their directions; and half that resultant
is defined to be the ‘resolvent’ of either of the equal forces.
    4. When any number of forces act on a point, if any
straight line be drawn through that point, and planes be
drawn through this line and the respective directions of the
forces; and if in each plane a force equal to the force in that
plane be applied to the point, making an angle with the
 straight line equal to that which the other force makes, but
on the contrary side of the line, such a system of forces is
called ‘supplementary’ to the former.
    5. A system of forces acting on a point is in equilibrium
when their resultant is zero.
    Prop. I. When a system of forces is in equilibrium, the
sum of the resolvents in the direction of any straight line
through their point of application is zero.
    The system being in equilibrium, the supplementary system
will also be in equilibrium; for this latter system is nothing
more than the former turned through 180° round the as
sumed line.
    The two systems are therefore also in equilibrium, and con
sequently the resultant zero.      But this resultant consists of
the (algebraic) sum of the several resultants of the pairs of
equal forces in the several planes through the assumed line,
and half the resultant is therefore the sum of the resolvents of
the given system.      The resultant being zero, the sum of the
resolvents is also zero.
    Prop. II. Denoting the resolvent of a force P in the                                     di
rection of a line making an angle 6 with the direction of the
force by P. f6, it is required to assign the form off?.
    It is an immediate consequence of our definition of resol
vent that       f6 =      1   when   0   = 0, and that f( =          0 when        6   = 3.
                                                                              7<U+017F>
Moreover, that f6 cannot                 =   0   for any value     of    <
                                                                     0

in  integral positive powers             of   0.

    The plant was cut into pieces and treated in a capacious
 vessel with boiling water.   After the boiling had continued
 for some   time, the fluid, which had acquired a yellowish
 brown colour, was strained through cloth.    On cooling there
 was deposited from it a white substance in flocks and minute
 crystals. It was separated by filtration and washed with cold
 water. After drying it had a grayish appearance. In order
 to purify    it,

    This body is the most important of those existing in the
 plant, as it is that one which gives rise to the colouring matters
 for the production of which the lichen is employed.                      It is
 not  possible   however to obtain much from the              plant,  since by
 the action both of      boiling    water and alcohol it         undergoes    a
 rapid change. By the method described above                      obtained in            I

precipitating basic acetate of lead, reducing chloride of gold,
and giving a red colour with ammonia and red flocks on
boiling with nitric acid. Erythric acid then, like lecanoric,
is converted by alkalies into orcine and carbonic acid. A so
lution of erythric acid in ammonia exposed to the air soon
becomes of a dark-red or purple colour.      It is the basis, and
I  believe the only one, of the colouring matters derived from
the plant.    An alcoholic solution of erythric acid is not pre
cipitated by nitrate of silver, but the addition of nitrate of
silver to an ammoniacal solution produces a white precipitate,
which on boiling becomes black, a mirror of silver being
formed at the same time on the sides of the glass. Chloride
of gold added to an alcoholic solution is not changed even on
boiling. With perchloride of iron an alcoholic solution strikes
a deep purple colour; on the addition of ammonia the colour
is changed into yellow, but the oxide of iron is not precipi
tated, unless the fluid be boiled.    It is not precipitated by
an alcoholic solution of acetate of  lead, but basic acetate of
lead produces immediately a copious precipitate.
    On combustion with oxide of copper the following results
were obtained:—

  II. 0.3640 grm, gave 07835 carbonic acid and 0.1820

acid and evaporated to dryness. The residue was treated
with alcohol, which on evaporation gave crystals of orcine.
Its products of decomposition with alkalies are therefore the
same as those of lecanoric aether.  Its analysis gave the fol
lowing results:—

 has   a strong but not disagreeably bitter taste.             soluble                 It   is
 water, alcohol and aether. Its solubility          aether distinguishes    in
it  from Kane's amarythrine and telerythrine, which are insolu
  ble  inthat fluid.       does not dissolve readily

 easily in boiling water. Its solution in the latter, however, does
not re-deposit it on cooling.         On evaporating a solution of it
in water or      alcohol,  it is left behind as a white crystalline
mass, but never in well-defined crystals or needles. Its so
lutions redden litmus paper slightly. It does not undergo
any further change on being treated with boiling water, nor
 does it form an aether on being treated with boiling alcohol,
as erythric acid does; it has therefore little or no claim to be
considered as an acid. Heated on platinum foil it melts to a
yellow fluid, is decomposed, and burns with a bright flame,
leaving no ash. Heated in a tube closed at one end it gives
a sublimate of orcine.       It is decomposed by boiling nitric acid
with an evolution of nitrous acid. Concentrated sulphuric
acid dissolves         and  it,        on

baryta water deposits carbonate            baryta       boiling, and the    on

    as observed    in the Tongue of the living Frog, Toad, &c. 273
prosecute it in common.           My surprise therefore was great,
when a few    days    after I was informed (without any intimation
from M. Donné)         that he  had communicated the experiment
to the Société      Philomatique.       At the next meeting of the
Society I attended, and found that in the procès verbal of the
preceding meeting, in giving an account of the experiment,
M. Donné had omitted to mention my name and co-operation.
I seized the opportunity to rectify this mistake, and to state
the arrangement that         I had made with M. Donné, and to
disclaim any precedence on               his
                                         part.       have only

that these statements were made before              very afull  meeting                    of
the members, that M. Donné was present, and that they were

elevations above the rest             the membranes, which very much

     as observed   in the Tongue of the living Frog, Toad, &c. 275
of the eyelids; when this surface is covered with ink,                                 these
minute elevations become still more apparent.
   Microscopic Examination.— It will be found advisable to
commence this examination by means of the simple micro
scope, as it offers us at one view the principal phaenomena to
be observed; and for this purpose a lens of nioderate power
will suffice.
   The blood-vessels, which to the naked eye appeared to ter
minate so abruptly, are seen to be continuous canals carrying
blood in opposite directions.    In the arteries the direction of
the blood appears to be centripetal, from the inversion caused
by the instrument, and the globules are pale. The veins are
more voluminous than the arteries, and contain blood much
darker, moving more slowly.
   The minute elevations on the upper surface are seen to be
of two kinds; one like small transparent grapes, within which
there is a very active circulation; and the other of a conical
shape, adherent at the base and destitute          of internal circula
tion. The first are minute glands, the latter are the papillae
in which probably resides the power of taste.
   The nerves are recognised by their wavy direction, their
dark outlines by transmitted light, and their whiteness when
viewed by reflexion.                    -
    Epithelium.-The scales of epithelium form a layer which
covers every part of the upper surface of the tongue, and are
the first parts which offer themselves to the microscopic ob
server.    With a strong magnifying power they present a most
interesting appearance, like a mosaic pavement, or a complete
scaly armour covering the papillae and the glands, descending
into the interior of the latter, and into         the deeper inequali

ence    of small filaments projecting upwards in a vertical direc
 tion, and which are probably the ciliary filaments with which
 they are studded.
    The flattened appearance of the epithelial scales, I believe,
 is owing to the manner in which the light is transmitted
 through the membrane, which gives a view of their horizontal
 section, but conveys no idea of their projection upwards.             I
 am led to this conclusion from the appearance of the papillae
 and glands, which project upwards into the mucous mem
 brane, and are found to present at their borders several pro
jections, such as we should expect from small bodies shaped
 like those figured by Henle, as existing on the inner side of
 the cheek in man.         In Plate I. figs. I and 2, may be seen
 these toothed    projections   corresponding in size to the scales,
 which corroborates the view of regarding each of them as
 forming a small conical projection above the membranes.
 The scales on the under surface are much smaller and more
 indistinct, but are the same in other respects.
    Cilia and ciliary movements.-These may be seen with great
facility at the upper surface, when a sharp border of the
tongue is examined under strong magnifying power.                   For
this purpose a portion of the tongue is to be placed between
two slips of glass with a little water: the foreign particles in
suspension will then show by their agitation the existence of
 the ciliary motion, which will be seen at the borders of the
membrane. There will be perceived, under favourable cir
cumstances,     minute projections or filaments; but more fre
quently there will be seen merely a kind of flittering move
ment, without the cilia which give rise to it being distinguished
separately. These cilia were not included in the communica
tion to the Société Philomatique, and their detection is due to
 M. Donné at a subsequent period.
    Tongue of the Toad.—It is covered with more irregular
epithelia, generally not so large as those of the Frog; in other
respects they are much alike.
    Tongue of the Lizard.—It is very remarkable for the thick
and horny papillae with which it is covered. These are                      all

as the second anatomical stratum of the tongue; these con

    The papillae are small bodies of a cylindrical, conical or
club-like shape, connected at the base so as to be continuous
throughout. In thickness or breadth they vary between about
On 25 and 0”05: their length cannot be accurately deter
mined, as they have no fixed line of demarcation at their point
of insertion on the mucous membrane. No appearance of any
circulation is found in any of these papillae: the blood-vessels
run by them, sometimes forming vascular loops, but are
rarely seen to penetrate through them; and even in those
cases the vessel is frequently external to the papilla, which is
sufficiently transparent to allow the blood-vessel to be seen
through     it.        inspecting the surface

tain that the secretion which lubrifies the surface of the tongue
is very abundant over these bodies, and that it appears to arise
from them.      On examining the fluid, it was found to be a
thick mucus, without any of the globules commonly known to
characterize it.
   The tongue of the toad presents likewise numerous papillae
and glands similar to those of the frog.      In addition, nume
rous  depressions   in the mucous membrane are frequently
seen, which are of the same nature as the mucous follicles or
crypts in man. Around them and on their exterior we find
a very abundant network of capillaries.

                                                     in               the                                   in
capillary circulation                 is,
                            without doubt, muscular contraction;
for whenever that occurs, state              great activity
                                                 a              produced
                                                                of                            is

 as observed   in the Tongue of the living Frog, Toad, &c.      281
in the circulation for several moments, and the inertia of
several of the fluid columns is overcome. In recognising the
influence of muscular action on the circulation, we must not
forget that this is merely auxiliary to the great action of the
heart, and that it only occurs at irregular intervals.
   The action of the heart itself may be traced into the minu
test capillaries, and even sometimes to the large venous trunks,
by the periodical acceleration of the vascular column.    I have
already described the manner to detect the pulsations of the
heart of the frog;    Ifound the average number to be sixty-four
in a minute.    By counting the acceleration of blood in the
artery, these two are found to correspond with great precision.
In the same way, by accurately noting the time, we may in
most cases observe a similar acceleration in the minute capil
laries, and even in the veins.      Müller has already noticed an
oscillating movement in the capillaries, when the animal is in
a state of great exhaustion; but in my experiments          I  have
been able to detect it from the commencement without any
impairment of the vital powers.       In these instances the num
ber of accelerated movements in a minute is about thirty
eight, and they are synchronous with the contractions of the
heart: in the accompanying vein at the same time I have also
perceived a slight oscillating movement of the blood.          By a
little practice the synchronous action of the capillaries and
the heart will scarcely ever fail to be perceived.
    3. Corpusculation of Capillaries.—The peculiar manner
in which the lymph-globules, or corpuscles, conduct them
selves in the capillaries, when in an organ in a state of irri
tation, has of late engaged much attention.            The experi
ments of Mr. W. Addison of           Malvern,  have  greatly contri
buted to show these important functions in inflammation.          In
the tongue of the frog and toad they may be frequently seen
circulating with the red particles in the vessels, down to the
minutest capillaries.     As it has already been pointed out,
these spherules are generally found, when they come in con
tact with the parietes of the vessels, to retain their adhe
rence with greater force than is manifested by the red par
ticles in the like circumstances;        as in fig. 3, where the
current was observed to continue for many minutes without
displacing the globules near the sides of the vessel.         Thus
we frequently see a lymph-globule remain in the same place,
notwithstanding the current of red particles sweeping and
pushing by     it.    From  its  globular form       weshould have
expected,  a   priori, that the contrary would have been the
case.    The appearance   in  the larger vesselsof  these spherules,
adherent  to  their inner surface, has been very aptly compared
    Phil. Mag.  S.   3.Vol. 29. No. 194. Oct. 1846.

282        Dr. Waller            on some Tissues                of the Animal Frame,
to so many pebbles or marbles over which a stream runs
without disturbing them. Another arrangement of them in
the capillaries is shown in fig. 4, where the vessel is occupied
solely by these spherules.        This is only to be found near
the borders of the tongue, where we may suppose that the
greatest irritation exists.      The spherules are there found
to be  quite motionless,  and not a single red particle can be
detected at  any  point of the vessel, which, in the case in ques
tion, was followed for a considerable length. The corpuscles,
which are transparent, are occasionally seen to be granulated.
It appears to be very doubtful whether this corpusculation (if
I  may be allowed the expression) is an invariable accompa
niment of          all
                cases                of
                          irritative congestion       inflammatory                   or
action,     has been maintained. As far
            as                                   have been enabled         as  I
to judge, the corpusculation only occurs after        rapid circula
tion has existed for some time        the vessels      the part irri
                                                       in                             of a
tated; but       the congestion and stagnation occur quickly,
                   if

                                           of   the
I    denominate another effect produced        increased influx                 by
of   blood, which,   not     striking

corpuscles,          is    still more constantly observed.                                     It    consists
in   a    kind of condensation of the tissue on the exterior of
the vessel, and appears                   produced
                                               to    be     the exudation            by

     5.Eartravasation                of
                             Blood.—When this occurs, the whole
surface      the tongue becomes covered with numerous spots
            of                                                                                                of
blood, similar        those which appear
                          to                       the human body.        on

  as observed         in the Tongue of the living Frog, Toad, &c.              283
 globules that have escaped.        This fact is interesting, as the
 appearance of the rupture shows how much the tissue of the
 capillary is capable of being distended: either the blood does
 not always escape through the vessel, or the opening becomes
 soon closed up; for I have frequently seen small tumours,
 similar to that in fig. 6, and often larger, into which the blood
 penetrated and was seen to circulate*.
    Muscles.—Muscular       tissue is known to consist of minute
fibres, which present under the microscope the appearance of
 straight tubes or cylinders, generally of the same thickness
throughout, but varying in different fibres. In general these
cylindrical fibres are closely packed together in a parallel                    di
rection, and adhere together by means of a semifluid glutinous
substance possessing the properties of cellular tissue.                        Ac
cording to Krause, these fibres, which are also frequently
known under the name of primitive fasciculi, vary in diameter
from goth to ºth of a line.         In the human pharynx, accord
ing to Schwann, they are from ºth to ºth of a line.
    In certain parts of the body we find that these fibres pre
sent under the microscope dark lines or streaks in the direc
tion of the transverse diameter, resembling the steps of a ladder;
other fibres, on the contrary, are simple tubes without any
striae, and perfectly plain.     The striated fibres were supposed
for some time to      belong   exclusively   to the muscles endued
with voluntary action, and the latter to those removed from
the influence of the will.        But although such is generally
the  case,  it has been found that this rule is not without excep
tion.    It has been remarked, that all the involuntary muscles
with striated fibres are very red and fleshy, and that the vo
luntary muscles which are without them are pale and thin.
    The muscular striae have been the subject of great contro
versy. By some they are considered to consist of globules,
which by their close arrangement in a line create a striated
appearance.       A hollow cylinder, such as the fibre appears to
be, is supposed to contain these globules within           the inter it:
mediate spaces are supposed              light, from the absence
                                               to   be                           of
the globules, and           tooccupied
                                 be                      by
                                             some transparent fluid.
This       the opinion advocated
          is                                        by
                                           Prevost, Dumas, Müller,
Edwards, Home, &c.
    Having given these brief preliminary details, will now             I
describe the muscular parts                    as
                                     they are seen    the tonguein               of
the frog and toad.
    Below the epithelium and papillae are seen the muscular
.*       At   some points there exist       the minuter veins considerable constric
                                        ofin

with any abnormal condition.

284          Dr. Waller on                some    Tissues     of the Animal Frame,
fibres crossing in every direction, like straight lines or cylin
 ders, of an even outline and without any subdivisions: at the                                          in
feriorsurface they are still more distinctly seen, from the greater
 thickness of the epithelial covering and the absence of papillae:
 and from the mode of arrangement they may be compared to
 the threads of a piece of linen, or the beams of a raft. Thus
 we generally find one layer of fibres arranged transversely in a
 parallel direction, and with considerable intervals between
 them.      Below these, by varying the focus slightly, appear
 other fibres cutting them at right angles, but otherwise                                               ar
 ranged in a similar way. In this manner appear successive
 layers of muscular fibres at different angles. In addition to
 these layers is the genio-glossus proceeding from the convexity
 of the lower jaw-bone, and composed of round fibres arranged
 together like a bundle of reeds, gradually expanding in a
 curved direction towards the anterior extremity of the tongue.

ing observations extracted from my notes.
   August 1st.—A toad was examined after it had been dead
two or three hours; the abdominal cavity and cellular tissue
were found distended by a limpid dropsical collection of serum,
containing numerous white corpuscles, with a few blood-discs.
The mesentery was arranged for microscopic inspection, and
                                                                                                   all
at its
     capillaries were found filled with corpuscles and discs
    rest.     Upon examining the membrane observed corpus                 I

they had previously been detected, and after                     few minutes

in this manner from the vessel the red discs remained station

the ordinary way. After the observation had continued for
half     an hour, numerous corpuscles were seen outside the ves
sels, together with           very few blood-discs,

The corpuscles were generally distant about 0”03 from their
parietes. After the experiment had lasted about two hours,
thousands           these corpuscles were seen scattered over the

was successful, and find that bromine, chloride of iodine and
iodine, may be united with lime, forming compounds having
properties similar to the so-called chloride of lime.
    The bromide of lime" may be produced by allowing bro
mine vapour to act upon hydrate of lime for some hours: the
most convenient method of doing this is to place some of the
hydrate at the bottom of a flask, and then put some bromine
into a glass capsule supported a little above the lime. As heat
is developed during the combination, it is better to place the
lower part of the flask in water at the temperature of about 50°
F. : the lime gradually assumes a beautiful scarlet colour, and
acquires an appearance very similar to that of the red iodide
of mercury. The chloro-iodide of lime may be formed in the
same manner: it has a deep brown colour.              Both these com
pounds, when the vapour arising from them is not too intense,
 have an odour analogous to that of bleaching powder, and
 quite distinguishable from chlorine, bromine or iodine alone.
    Those Daguerreotypists who use chlorine in combination
with bromine, as in Wolcott's American mixture, or M. Gué
 rin's Hungarian solution, which is a compound of bromine,
chlorine and iodine, may obtain similar substances in the solid
 state, which may be used with great advantage.             By passing
 chlorine over bromine, and condensing the vapours into a
 liquid, and then allowing the vapour of this to act upon lime,
a solid may be obtained having            the properties      the Ame

      Dr. Dalton knew well the importance of the principle he
   was attempting to establish, for he declares                    is the            “It
   greatest discovery that I know of next to the atomic theory.”
   —New and Easy Method of Analysing Sugar.
      In May 1845, Messrs. Playfair and Joule presented to the
   Chemical Society a memoir, in which they have recorded the
  results of an elaborate experimental examination of Dalton’s
  hypothesis. (See Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxvii. p. 453.)
  Their conclusions are no less startling than were those of
  Dalton, on which the inquiry proceeded. They find his doc
  trine in relation to sugar to be true.                             “It
                                                     is,” they say, “an
  extraordinary fact, that the twelve atoms of carbon in sugar
  cease to occupy space in solution, and that the bulk of an
  atom of sugar is just the bulk of                            its
                                                oxygen and hydrogen
  considered        water. And
                        as          this,”  they  say, “is matter                    a             of
  supreme interest, and cannot fail          lead      important results
                                                          to              to
  when we come                to
                       the consideration         organic        of
                                                           compounds.”
  —Pages 530 and 474.
     They next confirm Dalton's statement with regard                sul                      to
 phate    of magnesia and other analogous salts, namely, that
 when anhydrous they occupy              space       no
                                                    solution, but when
                                                                     in
 hydrated they add the bulk            the water of     hydration    the  of                  to
 bulk of the water of solution.
    Thirdly, they find that other compounds dissolved              water                  in
                                                                                     by

    These statements affirm three main propositions, namely,–
     1. That certain anhydrous substances when dissolved                                           in
water occupy          space. no The volume         the solution      of

same as the volume of the water contained in it.
   2.   That other anhydrous substances when dissolved                                             in
water assume        fived and characteristic volume;

their carbon occupies          space, but their hydrogen and oxy

    Other subjects than these are discussed in the memoir of
Messrs. Playfair and Joule, but in order to avoid complication
I  shall confine myself entirely to what relates to the atomic
volume of substances in solution.
    Ifthe first two of the foregoing propositions are true, they
give us important information respecting the constitution of
                                         of If,
aqueous solutions.             for example, we are furnished with

                                                                       solu                           in
tion.    I compared therefore the doctrines with the facts care

292                    Mr. Griffin        on the Constitution   of
fully, and I feel bound to declare that they are at variance.
Among a dozen chemical substances, whose solutions I have
examined,          I
               find only one that appears to have a fixed atomic
volume in solution in water. That substance is ammonia.
 All the other substances that I have examined vary constantly
in their liquid volume, according to the state of dilution, and
 I  am forced to the conclusion, in so far at least as concerns
the substances that              I
                         shall enumerate, that the doctrine of a
 fixed atomic volume in solution is fallacious and of no use.
While I think it right to state this opinion explicitly, I do so
with considerable diffidence. It is possible that I may have
overlooked some circumstance essential to the full compre
hension of the question.       I by no means deny the accuracy
of the   experiments  upon   which the opposite opinion has been
founded.     The difference in our conclusions results from dif
ferent ways of interpreting the experiments. The conclusions
are however incompatible; and if the doctrines of Messrs.
Playfair and Joule shall prove to be correct, serious fallacies
must exist in my calculations or mode of reasoning.
    To place the evidence on this subject before chemists,                     I
proceed to detail my researches into the constitution of solu
tions of acids and alkalies.     An investigation of this sort has
the unfortunate    property,  that,  dealing with a great variety
of separate facts, an account of it must necessarily be long.
I  shall shorten it to the utmost by throwing as much as pos
sible into the form of Tables; and in order to render the con
densed account intelligible,                  I
                                   shall begin by describing the
plan of the Tables, and explaining such terms and other par
ticulars as seem to require               it.

of solution. Column 2 shows the specific gravity of the solu
tion, or the weight in avoirdupois pounds of a decigallon.
By multiplying the specific gravity by 7000, we obtain the
weight of a decigallon in grains.
   Column 3 shows the absolute weight of anhydrous acid
contained in a decigallon of each solution, expressed in test
atoms. To find the weight in grains, the numbers in this
column must be multiplied by 501-165, the number given at
the head of the table as the weight of a test atom.
   These two columns of each table contain the physical and
chemical data from which                 all       the particulars given                           in   the other

  In this   case the water present is   in greater quantity than
would suffice to fill the  decigallon measure if water alone was
present.    The 5° of acid (25.058 grs.) condense their own
volume and 1203 septem besides.         The effect produced by
100° of  acid, or 1 test  atom,  is of course 20 times as much,

   The numbers in column 6, which represent the condensa
tion that takes place, are found by subtracting the numbers
contained in column 5 from the number which represents the
volume of the test atom of uncombined acid SO", which
number is placed at the head of column 5.
   The numbers in column 6 represent the actual condensa
tion effected in each mixture by the chemical power of one
test atom of SO”.    I do not mean to ascribe the diminution
of bulk to the   acid, but to the compound which the acid
helps to form. There is consequently a fallacy in the state
ments given in column 5.     It is not absolutely true that SO”
occupies the volume there assigned to it in different solutions.
It is only true if the actual condensation that occurs is
reckoned solely upon the acid, and none ascribed to the water
or the resulting hydrate; but in reality the hydrate alone
suffers the whole condensation.      This compound has the
property of existing, at a given temperature, within a smaller
volume than that occupied by its uncombined elements.
None of the condensation therefore can be properly ascribed
either to the acid or to the water individually. This being
understood, the fallacy in the table can lead to no error.
The plan adopted has the advantage of rendering the effects
of different substances acting on water readily comparable
with one another.
   The numbers contained in column 7 represent the atomic
volume of the different solutions, that is to say, the volume
of solution that contains a test atom of the anhydrous acid.
To find these numbers we divide 1000 by the numbers con
tained in column 3, or by the degree expressed in test atoms.

298                  Mr. Griffin            on the Constitution             of
mined by the following process. The numbers in column 7
show the volume in septems of every solution equivalent to l
test atom of anhydrous acid. Deducting from that number the
volume occupied by 1 test atom of anhydrous acid, as quoted
in the same horizontal line in column 5, the residue is the
quantity of associated water expressed in septems.     Dividing
this residue  by the atomic volume of   water, 16:07,  the pro
duct shows the number of atoms of water that occur in
combination with 1 atom of the anhydrous acid.
   The range of the experiments recorded in this and the
following tables, is from a solution saturated at 62°F. to a
solution containing 1° of acid or other substance per deci
gallon, or 1 test atom in 10 imperial gallons of solution.                                            I
do not stop at that stage of dilution because the condensing
power of the chemical substances is exhausted, for       find no                        I
limit to that power.                 I
                          stop because experiments performed
on liquors further diluted do not give results of sufficient ac
curacy for this inquiry. It is impossible to determine the
exact specific gravity of solutions running between sp. gr.
1-001 and sp. gr. 1'000.
 Observations on some of the prominent features of the Table
                    of Sulphuric Acid.
   Messrs. Playfair and Joule (Philosophical Magazine, vol.
xxvii. p. 480) consider the atomic volume of sulphate of water
to be equal to twice the atomic volume of water. Deducting
the water, this leaves 16-07 as the volume in solution of the
anhydrous sulphuric acid. This agrees with a solution of
about 160° of chemical strength, but disaccords with every
other solution, weaker or stronger.    In fact, anhydrous sul
phuric acid has no fixed volume in solution.        Its measure
extends from + 33.96 septems to —68:41 septems, changing
with every change in the composition of        hydrates,   that       its                   so

   The opinion entertained by Dalton, that anhydrous salts
dissolve in water without adding to its bulk, is singularly in
applicable to sulphuric acid. Half an atom of water, mea
suring 8.035 septems, saturated with SO", so as to form the
fuming acid of 2381°, acquires the volume of 41.999 septems,
or 1000 septems of water produce 5227 septems of fuming

304                      Mr. Griffin          on the Constitution                     of
               Observations on the Table                       of Muriatic Acid.
   Muriatic acid has only one-third part of the solubility of
sulphuric acid. A saturated solution of the latter contains
about 24 test atoms, that of the former only about 8 test atoms
per decigallon.   The condensing power of muriatic acid is
only a tenth part of that of sulphuric acid, and though always
progressing with dilution, yet when the acid forms the hy
drate containing 6000 atoms of water, where the dilution is                                                        s
about 800 fold, the entire condensation does not amount to
10 septems.    The atomic measure at the highest is about 24
times that of  water, and at the lowest is not less than twice
that of water.
   The limited solubility of certain substances in water has
been sometimes ascribed to the action of cohesion, but it is
difficult to conceive in what manner cohesion can limit the
solubility of muriatic acid gas. The two upper lines in Table
IV. exhibit a singular illustration of the effects of cohesion.
The compression of 40 atmospheres at 50°F. is required to
reduce muriatic acid gas to a liquid of sp. gr. 1:27, in which
condition the test atom measures 51.2 septems, and the deci
gallon contains 19% test atoms. The compressive power of
water acting on the gas at about the same temperature, and
under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere, reduces the
anhydrous acid to sp. gr. 16963, in which condition           test                                   its
atom measures     only 38-33   septems, and the   decigallon con
tains     26
          test atoms.   We may judge from this fact that the
limited solubility             of
                       muriatic acid     water results, not from
                                                               in

                        of      but from - quality the very oppo  a
site to cohesion.
  The fraction which                    + 1   indicates the mean specific gravity
of   100°      of   muriatic acid        is    (-6963+26:089–) 026688.

   Messrs. Playfair and Joule (Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. pp. 495,
521, 527) are of opinion that the atomic measure of muriatic
        is,  concentrated solutions, equal                                                 to

   The greatest chemical strength of nitric acid in solution is
1348}*. This constitutes the protohydrate of sp. gr. 1521.
The volume of a test atom of acid, as it exists in this hydrate,
is 58-09 septems. The condensation which occurs in diluted
solutions extends to 31 septems per test atom in a solution
of 1°, where the dilution is 1348 fold. Both as respects so
lubility and power of condensation, nitric acid stands between
sulphuric acid and muriatic acid.                                                          º
   The fraction which + 1 indicates the mean specific gravity
of 100° of nitric acid is (6651 + 17-216 =) 038634.

                         density in the hydrates of nitric acid
                                          strength, namely,
coincides with that of           chemical                    in
the protohydrate. The hydrate that distils without alteration
in constitution is N* O*, 4H2O. The hydrate that sustains
the greatest amount of condensation is N*O°, 8H* O.
   Messrs. Playfair and Joule’s account of the atomic volume
of nitric acid is as follows (Phil. Mag., vol. xxvii. p. 521):
—“Nitrate of water in the acid of sp. gr. 1-42 seems to affect
four volumes. . . . . Nitrate of water calculated on weak acids
has three volumes; but there being no good fixed point upon
which to make the calculation, we must leave at present this
point undetermined.”
   This estimate of the atomic measure of the acid in solution
of sp. gr. 1:42 is nearly correct. Four volumes for the hy
drate is three volumes for the anhydrous acid, and 3 x 16:07
 = 48.21, while the number given in Table VI. is 49'10 sep
tems. Three volumes is also correct for the hydrate in a
single weak solution; for 16-07 × 2=32-14 septems is nearly
the atomic measure of the anhydrous acid in a solution of 4°.
But there is no sudden fall in the atomic volume from 4 to 3,
nor do these numbers apply to any solutions save the two
that are named specially. They are only separate links of a
                                            all
long chain, whose parts are         different magnitudes.

               Observations on the Table              of Acetic Acid.
   The whole of this table, with the exception of the first two
lines, is calculated from my experiments. The acid on which
the experiments were made was prepared for me by Mr.
Charles Glassford, chemist to Messrs. Turnbull and Co.,
Camlachie.        It was very pure.
   Upon crystallizing a quantity of this acid and pouring off
the mother-liquor,           I found the latter to have a strength of
910°.     The crystals were melted, the solution recrystallized,
the crystals pounded, the mother-liquor drained off, the cry

stals remelted, recrystallized, abstracted once more from the
mother-liquor, and finally brought into solution in a closed
bottle at 62°F., and not heated higher than that point. The
specific gravity of the solution thus procured was 1.058286,
and its chemical strength 955°, which gives the formula
C*H" O”-- 1:178 H*O, showing nearly one-fifth part of an
atom more water than belongs to the protohydrate. Repeated
trials brought me no nearer to the protohydrate, which                                                               I
imagine is partly owing to the difficulty of separating the
mother-liquor entirely from the crystals.          Van der Toorn
(Report of the Fourth Meeting of the British Association,
Edin. 1834) states the specific gravity of the protohydrate at
59°F. to be 1.057, which makes              strength            979°.        its                         to   be

           stratum level than that of the new red sandstone,
        it may be interesting to communicate to your readers,
that some time since, while examining the fallen blocks of crag
                                                                                        I
and freestone on the shore at Ventnor, I discovered distinct
impressions of the feet of animals of various kinds, strongly
indented in the flinty blue rag which forms the bed of the free
stone.    With the exception of the marks left by the crusta
ceans on the oolite near Bath, I am not aware that within the
range of 3000 feet (which may be the average depth between
the freestone and the new red sandstone) any traces of animal
footmarks have been found. After thoroughly searching the
locality, I  found and removed to my residence the blocks de
scribed as under.
   Block 1 bears a good and interesting impression of the feet
of a three-toed creature, very similar in                      its
                                               general character

the toes, which      the above plate measure
                       in

    Block 2 is a large block, weighing 33 cwt., and
has confused impressions, apparently of feet of a
large three-toed creature, which has trodden more            º)
than once on the same mark.         There is also a very
plain footmark of a triangular form about 2 inches broad,
apparently of an animal whose foot has three soft promi
menceS.
    Block 3 bears the deep impression of apparently a web
footed creature, having three toes set somewhat
obliquely; the right toe being much the thickest,
but shortest. All three toes had claws, and the
angles between them measure about 20° and 35°
respectively, the larger angle being between the
middle toe and the short thick toe. The ex
treme length from the middle toe to the tapered
“heel” is 24 inches. There are other not easily
described impressions on this stone also.
    Block 4 contains a deep impression of the
footstep of a quadruped, not much unlike
that which would have been left by a large
dog.     It measures in length 2; inches and
in breadth 2+ inches.
    Block 5 has an impression something simi
lar to the one on block 4.
    Block 6 shows the footmark of a three-toed animal
 (toes broad and short, and making angles of about
 50° with each other), and from the sharpness of \
 the narrowed heel may be compared to a fleur
 de-lis.
    The above blocks have been detached from the superposed
 freestone, by their having fallen from the cliff during a land
 slip; and having lodged below high-water mark, the constant
 action of the surge and shingle, perhaps for centuries, has
 denuded the ancient surface of the rag, leaving however por
tions of the freestone in the footmarks above-described.
    It is extremely difficult to separate the lower portion of the
 freestone from the rag; they in general are so gradually
 blended, that it is not easy, in cutting, to ascertain which really
 is the surface of the rag. My attempts to clear other portions
of the bed, when aided by experienced masons, were a com
 plete failure.
    On many surfaces of the ragstone, which have been cleaned
 by the action of the waves, vast quantities of gigantic mollusks
 are visible; and indeed I at first mistook the confused mark
 ings on Block 2 for the remains of a “lobated Siphonia,” until

XLVIII.    On Nitraniline, a new Product of Decomposition of
  Dinitrobenzole. By JAMEs SHERIDAN MUs PRATT, Ph.D.
  and AUGUSTUs WILLIAM HoFMANN, Ph.D.*
A GREATof
        action
                  number of investigations have proved that the
                     nitric acid upon organic bodies produces
                                            jº.
changes in their composition in two ways.               First, there is
sometimes simply an accession of                 to   the   elements of
the organic matter, the nitric acid being reduced to nitric
oxide or nitrous acid and expelled. Thus, by treating indigo
with nitric acid it becomes converted into isatine, the compo
sition of which differs from that of indigo only by containing
two equivalents of oxygen more than the latter.                Cinnamic
acid  passes   into  hydride  of benzoyle, water  being    formed,  and
the excess of carbon, combining with the oxygen of the nitric
acid, escapes in the form of carbonic acid.              By a further
supply of oxygen the hydride of benzoyle is converted into
benzoic acid.       In all other cases the action of nitric acid
differs in no    respects  from that of other means of oxidation,
ev. gr. chromic acid, peroxide of manganese and sulphuric
acid, &c.
   The action of nitric acid however upon organic matters is
in other cases more complex; it does not consist solely in the
supply of oxygen, but besides that element, nitrogen also
enters into the newly-formed compound.              Indigo, subjected
for a  long  time to the action of concentrated nitric acid, under
  oes a series of metamorphoses, and the last product which
is formed, namely, carbazotic acid (nitrophenisic acid), con
tains to the same quantity of carbon a much larger propor
tion of nitrogen than the indigo from which it is derived.
    Cinnamic acid, hydride of benzoyle, and benzoic acid, none of
which contain nitrogen, furnish, as the last product of the
action of nitric acid, a nitrogenous acid, which is known as
nitrobenzoic (nitrobenzinic) acid.
   A great many of the nitrogenous compounds produced in
this manner possess the properties of acids. Besides the above
mentioned we might enumerate nitrocinnamic acid, nitrosali
cylic acid (anilic acid), and many others similarly constituted.

     a new Product                of Decomposition of Dinitrobenzole.      313
Some chemists have on this account, without hesitation,
assumed the presence of nitric acid in these bodies. Berzelius
represents the carbazotic acid as a copulated compound of
hydrated nitric acid with a sort of saline body, in which an
other equivalent of nitric acid is combined with an -
                                                       organic
oxide having the formula
                                      Cla     H, NOa.
Carbazotic acid is therefore a copulated acid of similar consti
tution with the sulphovinic acid (bisulphate of oxide of ethyle),
and would be represented as follows:–
                      C12    H2 NOs, NO3 +              HO, NOs.
Also, in the other acids of this nature, which contain only
one equivalent       of nitrogen, Berzelius assumes the presence of
nitric acid.        According to his view, nitrobenzoic and nitro
salicylic acids would be represented as                follows:–
       Nitrobenzoic acid . . Cla                   H, O2 + HO, NOg
       Nitrosalicylic acid . . Cia                 Hs O., + HO, NOg.
   There is no direct proof for this assumption, and therefore
other chemists believe that the nitrogen in these compounds
does not exist as nitric acid but as nitrous acid, NOs; thus ni
trobenzoic acid, according to Mulder, is Cla H, O, HO, NOs.
The compounds produced by the contemporaneous action of
nitrogen and oxygen upon organic bodies are however not
always acid; a great class of bodies furnish under such cir
cumstances products in which the acid properties of the nitric
acid have entirely disappeared: to these belong a number of
organic bodies, which consist only of carbon and hydrogen.
For example, if benzole is brought into contact with fuming
nitric acid, they combine with separation of water and form
an indifferent body, i. e. nitrobenzole (nitrobenzide) discovered
by Mitscherlich.
   Naphthalole (naphthaline), toluole, and a considerable num
ber of carbides of hydrogen, behave in a like manner.
   In which form is the nitrogen contained in these bodies,
as, for instance, in nitrobenzole?

314           Drs. Muspratt and Hofmann on Nitraniline,
able, lose however by a closer examination a considerable
portion of their probability.      Independent of the fact that
oxide of benzide is  merely  an hypothetical  compound while we
know the oxide of     ethyle in an isolated  state, the behaviour
of these two bodies towards potassa is sufficient to show a
decided dissimilarity in their constitution.        Nitrous ether,
like  all
        the other  compound    ethers,   decomposed        potassa,   is                                 by
giving rise    nitrite
                    to    potassa and alcohol
                                           of   (Liebig).   Nitro
benzole, when similarly treated, yields      acid     nitrogen;             no                of                          an
aqueous solution       potassa leaves this body quite intact, and

is  formed*.     We see here that            analogy between nitrousall
ether and nitrobenzole      disappears    entirely.
    Nitrobenzole undergoes still another change, which does
not   in any way agree with the benzide theory. According                                                                 to

without mentioning other objections                       evident, inas     to       it,     is
much        the above formula does not express the composition
             as
of  the new compound; for, according                 Deville’s analysis,        to
we find that instead          five    only  contains four equivalents
                                             of         it
of  hydrogen.
   Recently certain French chemists, Laurent, for example,
have represented these bodies under               different aspect.        a                                              A
great number         investigations had led
                           of of
                                                    the conclusion that         to
the hydrogen          many compounds may               wholly      partly            be
replaced          by
                  corresponding number
                       a                          equivalents       chlo    of                               of or
rine and bromine without altering the fundamental properties.
This law had been established for number of acids and                a                                                    in

                           has proved that the same law extends
                             of
also  to S

substitution, in which the hydrogen, instead of being replaced
by chlorine or bromine, is replaced by a compound radical,
namely by hyponitric acid. Whilst in the assumption of chlo
rine into an organic body, the replaced hydrogen is taken up by
another equivalent of chlorine, forming hydrochloric acid; in
the employment of nitric acid, the fifth equivalent of oxygen
combines with the replaced hydrogen, forming water.                                     Ben

in this way succeed: when aniline           mixed with pretty strong
nitric acid, massa                of

could not     succeed;   either the aniline    separated   unchanged,
or  its molecular constitution underwent            entire change, and an
the water    separated  resinous matters rather               acid than         of     an

remembering that the chlorine and bromine bases were pro

as at least to solve the questions that remained unanswered
in Zinin’s  experiments.    By doing so we very soon obtained
results which had escaped the observation of Zinin, and which
brought us to the point we aimed at.
   For our research we had to prepare a large quantity of                               di
mitrobenzole.  The transformation of nitrobenzole into dinitro
benzole proceeds very slowly, even when it is boiled repeatedly
with the strongest mitric acid. It is obtained however very
speedily by dropping benzole or nitrobenzole into a mixture
composed of equal parts of fuming nitric acid and concen
trated sulphuric acid, as long as the liquid remains homoge
neous. The liquid is now boiled for a few minutes and then
allowed to cool.    A thick mass of dinitrobenzole is formed,
which   by washing  with water is freed from      adhering acid.     all

                          Properties of Nitraniline.
      Nitraniline, as we have stated, is obtained from a hot
 aqueous solution, in the form of long yellow crystals. It is
 very sparingly soluble in cold water, so that nearly the whole
 is separated by crystallizing from this solvent. , Alcohol and
 ether also dissolve this base; from the former it crystallizes
 in silky needles, and from the latter in the same form, but
 not so well defined. Nitraniline dissolves in all acids, from
 which potassa separates it in yellow flakes, which under the
 microscope have a confused, needle-like structure.            At the
 ordinary temperature the base possesses no odour, but when
 slightly warmed, it evolves a peculiar aromatic odour, which
 somewhat resembles aniline.         Its taste is burning. When
 the crystals are heated they melt into a deep yellow oil, which
passes into a yellowish vapour, condensing in beautiful                 iri

Nitraniline sublimes without fusing when heated in a water
bath, yielding a sublimate of most beautiful crystals.           At a
higher temperature the base distils, leaving no residue, and
the liquid which passes over solidifies in the receiver or in the
neck of the retort into a scaly mass.         The boiling-point of
the base lies  higher than 285°C.     (545°Fahr.),   and the fusing
point at about 110° C. (230°Fahr.). Its vapour burns with
a smoky flame.
    Nitraniline is specifically heavier than water; it affords not
the slightest reaction with test papers; even rose paper, which
is so exceedingly sensitive for alkalies, is not at          all

   Nitraniline displaces none of the metallic oxides from their
acid compounds;                          its
                        basic properties are exceedingly weak.

easily, it may be cut anywhere in the middle, and the two parts

from three-quarters to an inch in width, well-burnt lime, which may
be readily moistened with water, from d to e, asbestos, or fragments
of pumice-stone, drenched with sulphuric acid, and separated from
the lime by a light stopper of asbestos; the small Woulf's flask
contains lime-water.
    The analysis is now performed in the following manner:—A small
quantity of sulphuric acid is poured into the flask a through the

of itself, it is made to do so by drawing gently with the mouth at h.
The evolution of gas, which is rendered perceptible by the ascending

 waited for; another portion of acid is then added, and this continued
until it may be assumed that a tolerable excess of acid has been in-       .
troduced.      This being done, some water containing a little caustic
potash in solution is allowed to flow into the flask by opening the
stopcock g, whereby a current of air is passed through the vessel a,
which carries the carbonic acid, contained partly in the liquid partly
 in the upper space of the vessel, into the tube be; but since this
would never be completely effected without the application of heat,
the vessel a towards the end of the experiment is immersed in a small
 dish filled with water, which is kept warm over a small lamp as long
 as is found requisite.
    It is best to regulate the current of air so that about 2 bubbles of
 gas pass through the lime-water in a second. It will however never
 be found to become in the least turbid.      It is scarcely necessary to
observe that the      object of the sulphuric acid in b c is to retain the
 moisture carried by the gas from a ; also that the potash added
 to the water which flows into the large flask is to absorb the car
 bonic acid of the atmospheric air; and, lastly, that, the increase in
  weight of be yields the result sought for.

result of any change produced upon the surface by external causes.
It is exhibited, under the usual modifications, if the surface of the
chrysammate is in optical contact with fluids and with glass; and
when the crystal is in the act of being dissolved, or when a fresh
surface is exposed by mechanical means, the superficial action of
the crystal upon light is in both cases the same.    When the chry
sammate is re-crystallized from an aqueous solution, it appears in
tufts of prisms of a bright red colour, the golden reflexion being
overpowered by the transmitted light; but when these tufts are
spread into a film by pressure, the golden yellow colour re-appears.
When the crystals of chrysammate are heated with a spirit-lamp,
or above a gas-burner, they explode with a flame and smoke like
gunpowder; and, by continuing the heat, the residue melts and a
crop of colourless amorphous crystals is left.     I have found the
same explosive property in the aloetinate of potash.-Athenaeum.
      INFUENCE OF NITROUS OXIDE GAS ON VEGETATION.
                    BY M. VogEL, JUN.
    It is generally admitted that nitrous oxide gas is incapable of sup
 porting life, although a candle which has been blown out is relighted
 by immersion in this gas, and burns with greater brilliancy in it than
in atmospheric air. The rapid combustion of the candle is owing to
 the ready decomposition of this gas at a high temperature, —a de
composition which cannot be effected in the lungs by respiration;
 whereas the air, which is a mere mixture of oxygen and azotic gases,
readily yields its oxygen in the act of respiration.
   The author obtained the nitrous oxide, used in his experiments,
from pure nitrate of ammonia; and into a vessel containing this gas
he introduced seeds of cress spread on a moist sponge. The intro
duction of the seed was effected under water, and so as to prevent
the access of atmospheric air, and it was expelled from the sponge
by slight pressure; sufficient water was left in the bottle for germi
nation; and after the sponge and seeds had been introduced, it was
hermetically closed.
   In order to make a comparative experiment, a sponge with cress
seed was also placed in a bottle containing atmospheric air.      After
some days the seed in this bottle began to germinate and to form
leaves; but the reverse was the case in the bottle containing the
seed in nitrous oxide.    Not the slightest appearance of germination
was perceptible: the seeds, nevertheless, were swelled and covered
with mucus, but without any change which indicated germination.
After two weeks had elapsed, the seed and sponge were removed from
the nitrous oxide, and as soon as they came into the air they began
to germinate; from this it follows that the seed had not lost         its
power     germinating  by  exposure   tonitrous oxide; whereas seeds
      to of
cease    germinate after they have been    in contact for short time

  The nitrous oxide gas     inwhich the seed had remained for tw

sipate the last traces of carbon which the filter may have left.      In
this manner the water may be ascertained by simple calcination, the
tungstic acid directly, and the alkali by difference.
   Having attempted to estimate the alkali by the quantity of sul
phuric acid fixed, it was found that tungstic acid, like the silicic and
boracic acids, decomposed the neutral sulphate at the temperature
requisite to destroy the bisulphate: the tungstic acid then combines
with the alkali, and forms a tungstate which is more or less acid; it
is therefore important not to carry on the operation so far. The bi
sulphate possesses the advantage of presenting sulphuric acid to
those parts of the salt which would not be decomposed, which at this
high temperature acts energetically.
   That the salt has been completely attacked, and that the tungstic
acid has not been hydrated, and consequently dissolved, may be as

drochloric acid. They do not in this case produce the slightest blue
tint, though capable of ascertaining the smallest quantity of tungstic
acid.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., Août 1846.
      PREPARATION OF CHLORIC ACID.                    BY M. BOETTGER.
  The author              that the preparation of chloric acid by means
                  observes,
of hydrosilicic  acid is attended with a great number of inconve
niences; he therefore proposes to replace it with oxalic acid, this
acid also yielding a salt of soda which is but slightly soluble in
Water.
   The following is the process recommended. First prepare a solu
tion of tartrate of soda, by dissolving seven parts of crystallized car
bonate of soda and seven and a half parts of tartaric acid in boiling
water; add to this solution while boiling a solution, also boiling, of
six parts of chlorate of potash in sixteen parts of water: let it cool,
so as to allow the tartar to deposit; then filter, and add to the solu
tion six parts of oxalic acid dissolved in six parts of water, heated
to a temperature not exceeding 133° F.; agitate the mixture briskly,
and put it into a freezing mixture, made with crystallized sulphate
of soda and muriatic acid; by this the oxalate of soda is deposited,
and it requires only to be separated by the filter.
   The chloric acid thus obtained is not chemically pure; but to pro
cure it pure and concentrated, it is to be treated with recently preci
pitated carbonate of barytes, crystallizing the chlorate formed, and
decomposing it with sulphuric acid.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch.,

composed; but the liquid containing the triturated and disorganized

LI.     The ASTRoNoMER Royal on the Bands formed by the
          Partial Interception of the Prismatic Spectrum.
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
SINGE       my return from the    continent  I have seen a report
     of the transactions of the    British Association at its late
meeting; and my attention has been directed to a communi
cation by my friend Prof. Powell, “On the Bands formed by
the Partial Interception of the Prismatic Spectrum,” which,
for care in observation, caution in theory, and courtesy in the
expression of doubt, merits well to be taken as a model for
papers of a similar character.
   Prof. Powell found that in certain points there is an appa
rent discordance between his observations and the result of my
deductions from the Undulatory Theory.           It is curious that
on these very points there is the most perfect accordance. The
discrepance has arisen from this circumstance: that my short
paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 1841, part 1, was
intended rather to show the possibility of explaining the bands,
than to enter into details as to their variation under varying
conditions of experiment; that I therefore investigated closely
only that case in which the bands are most conspicuously
formed; and that an expression used by me, with reference
only to that one case, has been (not unnaturally) applied to
other cases, to which it is totally inapplicable.
   In page 8 of my paper, line 20, I have made this restrictive
supposition: “And       if *  be equal to the change    of k corre
sponding to a change of 2 m in R.” This limitation, which
establishes a relation between the aperture of the eye or telescope

changing their places.
    All these theoretical results are in absolute accordance with
 Prof. Powell’s observations.             -                      -
    The fact, that the bands can sometimes be seen on only a
portion of the spectrum, is a result of this circumstance, that
the retarding plate cannot be placed close to the pupil of the
eye. A single trial will enable any one to perceive that the
further the plate is held from the eye, the smaller is the extent
of visible bands; and the injurious effect of this circumstance
is much greater when the pupil is small than when it is large;

with the square of the cosine, was anxious to obtain observa
tions in high latitudes in order to test the accuracy of his for
mula.     Mr. Scoresby, to whom I made application, was
fortunately able to state it as the result of numerous observa
tions made in different years, that the mean temperature in
the latitude of 78° was about 17°, from which he deduced that
of the Pole to be 10°. But as the mean temperature in the
latitude of 60° is 16° 92 less in the Old World than the New,
or in the meridian on which Mr. Scoresby approached
the Pole, it is obvious that the mean temperature of the Pole,
if deduced by the same process from the observations in the
Old World, would be even below zero. This result was
doubtless perplexing; but the perplexity was soon removed
by the return of Captain Parry in 1820 from Melville Island.
He found the mean annual temperature of that island, in 743°
of latitude, to be + 1° 33' Fahr., thus confirming the result
which we had obtained and previously communicated to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh”.          This extraordinary result,
 taken in connexion with Mr.        Scoresby’s,  suggested to us
the idea that the coldest  part  of the globe   was not far from
Melville Island, and that there were “two points of greatest
cold not many degrees from the poles, and in meridians nearly
at right angles to that which passes through the west of Eu
rope.”    From a comparison of a great number of mean tem
peratures both in the Old and New World in high latitudes,
we were led to the conclusion that the two cold poles were
situated in 80° of north latitude, and in 95° of east and 100°
of west longitudet, the mean temperature of the eastern

pole being + 1° Fahr., and that of the western — 34°, and
that they were nearly coincident with the magnetic poles of
the earth. These views have been adopted by Humboldt,
Erman, Kupffer, Dalton and others; and we have no doubt
that we shall be able, by means of the accurate meteorological
observations which are now making in different parts of the
world, to fix more accurately the position of these remarkable
points, and to determine whether or not their connexion with
the magnetic poles is merely accidental.
   This remarkable distribution of heat over the earth's sur
face, or rather in our atmosphere, is connected with the un
equal distribution of heat over the year.   In the cold meri
dians we have a hot summer and a cold winter, whereas in the
warm meridians the difference between the summer and the
winter temperature is greatly diminished. In order to express
                                                         65°.3
this conjoined effect, Humboldt adopts the form 51°1 389.7
adding the signs      of + and —, according           as the numbers
                                                    + 65°-3
are above or below zero.              Thus + 51°1       expresses
                                             + 38°-7
the temperature of Paris; the number 51°1 being the mean
annual temperature, 65°3 the mean temperature of summer,
and 387 the mean temperature of winter.       This arrangement
of the temperatures has, however, so much the appearance of
a mathematical formula, that we conceive it would be more
natural to place the numbers thus: + 65.3, + 51°-1, + 38°7,
or max. 65°-3, mean 51°1, min. 38°7, the mean temperature
occupying the middle place between the two extremes, and
the negative signs alone being prefixed to the numbers when
they are below zero.
   In treating of the cause of the inflexion of the isothermal
lines, Baron Humboldt has endeavoured to show, by very inge
nious arguments, that the form, the extent, and the altitude of
the continents, and their relation to the polar ice, are the prin
cipal causes of these inflexions. We are not prepared either to
controvert or to admit the accuracy of this explanation, which
we have no doubt will meet with a ready and a general accept
ance; but when we look at the system of isothermal curves
surrounding the poles of revolution, and mark their coinci
dence with the magnetic poles of the earth, and their simi
where T is the mean temperature of any place whose distance from the
two cold poles is 3 and   0',

    The difference between the Leith and Inverness ordinates,                            as
 shown in the table, page 346, exhibits the effect of an increase

 348      Sir D. Brewster on the Law of Daily Temperature,
 of latitude in producing an approximation              to a continental
 climate. The mornings at Inverness, from             1  h. A.M. till about
 5 h. 20 m. A.M., are colder; and the days, from 9 h. A.M. till
 34 h. P.M., are warmer in reference to the mean temperature
 than those at Leith; whereas, about the time of the morning
 and evening mean temperatures, it is warmer at Inverness in
 the morning and colder in the evening.
     Having obtained the ordinates of the mean annual curve of
 the daily temperatures, it becomes a curious subject of inquiry
 if this  curve has any resemblance to curves with which we are
familiar.     With this view we must divide it into four portions
or branches, namely, that between the hours of the evening
mean temperature and the minimum ordinate; that between
the minimum ordinate and the morning mean; that between
the morning mean and the maximum ordinate; and that be
tween the maximum ordinate and the evening mean.                    In this
way the mean annual curve of daily temperature will be                   di
vided into four different curves, which have a striking simi
larity to parabolas, as shown by the following table, which
contains the mean annual hourly temperatures for 1824 and
 1825, as observed, and as calculated on the supposition of the
temperatures being the abscissae of parabolas, and the horary
intervals the ordinates.

     Sir D. Brewster on the Law of Daily Temperature. 849
    The coincidence between the observed and calculated re
sults, as shown in this table, is so remarkable, that the para
bolic temperatures, as we may call them, never differ from the
real temperatures more than one QUARTER of A DEGREE OF
FAHRENHEIT.
    Since we began this article we have been favoured by Ro
bert Thom, Esq., of Ascog, a gentleman of great scientific
attainments, with the results of an hourly meteorological re
gister, which he kept for twelve consecutive years at Rothesay
in the Isle of Bute, and which we have no scruple in saying
forms the most important class of meteorological observations
which have ever been made, not only for their number and
continuity, but from the care and attention with which they
were conducted.         These observations possess also another
 interest, in so far as they exhibit the laws of temperature on
 the west coast of Scotland, and in a climate essentially differ
 ent from that of the east coast, to which our Leith and Inver
 ness observations relate.            Our limits will not permit us to
 give the results of these observations so fully as we could wish,
 but we shall endeavour to lay the most important of them
 before our readers. The following are the times of mean tem
  perature :-                Mean of twelve years,
                         from 1828–1832 inclusive.              Distances  from moon.

  Hence it appears that the hours of mean temperature are
  much earlier than at Leith, and are nearly the same as those
  at Inverness, differing from them only by four minutes in the
  morning and five minutes in the evening, while the critical
  interval differs from that of Inverness only nine minutes.
     The similarity between these two sets of observations will
  appear still more striking from the following law of the homo
  nymous   hours:–                                 Difference between the half-sum

      Hence it appears that the homonymous hours of mean
  temperature are 4 h. A.M. and 4 h. P.M., and 10 h. A.M. and
  10 h. P.M., the one differing only 5-100ths, and the other only
  8-100ths of a degree of Fahrenheit from the mean annual tem
  perature; while the maximum deviation, exactly as at Inver
  ness, occurs at 1 h. A.M. and 1 h. P.M., and at 7 h. A.M. and
  7 h. P.M., amounting at Rothesay to + 0.56 and                    –     0:49, and
  at Inverness to 0:55, an agreement so remarkable that it can
 not but surprise us.

     As Inverness is colder in the morning than Leith, so Rothe
 say is slightly colder than Inverness, from 1 h. A.M. till 4 h.
 A.M., then becomes slightly warmer till 1 h. P.M., from which
 time it continues colder till 12 at night.
     With such a valuable series of observations as those at Rothe
 say,   it became an object of great interest to ascertain the rela
 tion of the curve of annual temperature to the parabola. Before
we saw these observations we intimated to Mr. Thom our con
viction that the curve would deviate more from the parabola
than that at Leith, owing to the form of the visible horizon at
 Rothesay being so different from the open horizon at Leith.
If   a hill rises to the north of the place of observation, by which
the sun's rays are never obstructed, it can exercise little or no
influence on the thermometer; but if one or more hills obstruct
the sun's rays after he has risen above the true horizon, that
obstruction must affect the temperature of the place of obser
vation at the hours corresponding with the azimuth of the hill.
That this cause has operated at Rothesay will be seen from
the following table containing the observed temperatures, and
those calculated upon the supposition that the branches of the
curve are parabolic:-

    It appears from this table that in three of the four parabolic
branches the deviation from the parabola is considerably less
than in the Leith observations; whereas in the a<U+017F>ternoon
branch and in that part of it between the hours of four and eight,
the deviation is nearly double of what it is in the other branches
and in the Leith observations.                The observed temperatures
are less than     they  should      be,     and we can account for this
only by the interposition of some obstacle in the azimuth of
four, five, six, and seven o'clock P.M., or from the thermo
meter being better protected from extraneous influences at
these    particular hours”.
    As there are many meteorological registers which have been
kept only at two hours of the day, it became of importance to
deduce from them the approximate hours of mean temperature,
   * We find upon looking at the Register, that the thermometer is placed
in the shade in a window facing the north. The line of the building is 6°
15 to the north of due west, and hence the thermometer is better protected
from the sun in the afternoon than in the morning.

which seems to follow from the late experiments, negatives
this idea; and indeed it is given up by Liebig, who now only
says, in his Organic Chemistry, that                 acid is one of
the acids in lampic acid. But if we take the above-mentioned
normal mode of preparing it,-the method principally used by
Davy, Faraday and Daniell, then formic acid constitutes by
much the larger proportion of the acid liquid so prepared;
and as formic acid is well known to reduce the oxides of me
tals having feeble affinities for oxygen with effervescence, it is
plain that this characteristic property of lampic acid may be
with justice mainly ascribed to       formic constituent.  its
    But the more    important  point                    is,
                                        whether lampic acid con
tains   any  aldehydic   acid    all. On this,

                       of                      such    view.                  to         a               It
is admitted on all hands that there are other matters besides

these are characters which the presence                 aldehyde would        of

    The curves                 of
                     the great symmetrical wave        observed                             as                   at
 London      1842,
              in     1843,  and 1844, with the mean       the three                              of

                 Barometric     Wave       of November.             357
 years, are exhibited in Plate      III.
                                      which accompanies this com
 munication. This Plate illustrated my Report on Atmospheric
  Waves presented to the British Association for the Advance
 ment of Science at the Cambridge meeting in 1845, and to
 this and my preceding report in the volume for 1844 the
 reader is referred for further information respecting this par
 ticular wave, and also on the subject of atmospheric waves
 generally.    Since my second report was presented to the          As
 sociation the great wave has been again observed, and the
 comparison of the curves for 1842, 1843, 1844, and 1845 has
 suggested the idea that we have obtained the type of the baro
 metric oscillations during the middle portion of November.
 This type has been expressed in the following language:–
 “That during fourteen days in November, more or less equally
 disposed about the middle of the month, the oscillations of the
 barometer exhibit a remarkably symmetrical character; that
 is to say, the fall succeeding the transit of the maximum or
 highest reading designated by the word crest in the Plate, is
 to a great extent similar to the preceding rise.     This rise and
 fall is not continuous or unbroken; in three out of four of the
 occasions on which it has been observed, it has been found to
 consist of five distinct elevations. The complete rise and fall
 has been termed the great symmetrical barometric wave of
 November, and as such has been considered to result from the
 transit of a large wave; but there is great reason to believe
 that while it may be due to the transit of a normal wave of
 about fourteen days' amplitude, it also exhibits the transits of
Jive secondary superposed waves. At the setting in of the
 great November wave the barometer is generally low, some
 times below twenty-nine inches. This depression is succeeded
 by two well-marked undulations, varying from one to two days
 in duration.     The central undulation, which also forms the
 apex of the great wave, is of larger extent, occupying from
 three to five days; when this has passed, two smaller undula
 tions corresponding to those at the commencement of the wave
 make their appearance, and at the close of the last the wave
 terminates.”
     It is important to bear in mind that the symmetrical cha
 racter of the wave is confined to a certain line of greatest sym
  metry, and that at stations on each side of this line the sym
 metry is more or less departed from, according to their distance
  from or proximity to   it.   It   also important
                                    is                  notice that
                                                             to
 this lineof   greatest symmetry possesses         an
                                                 erratic character.
 In   the year 1842 it  stretched from Dublin        Munich,
                                                        to         Bir
  mingham and Brussels being two important stations                on   it.
  Last yearit   appeared to    be
                                confined    the south
                                              to         England;
                                                              of

858           Mr. Birt         on the great Symmetrical Barometric                        Wave.
Helstone being the station of greatest symmetry. The south
ern counties of England will under these circumstances present
an area for the establishment of highly important stations.
At the Orkneys (the extreme northern station in the series of
observations last year), the symmetry was most strikingly de
 parted from by the anterior portion of the wave being con
  siderably higher than the posterior; while at Paris, the most
 southern station from which observations have yet been received,
 the opposite of this occurred, the anterior portion being the
 lowest and the posterior the highest.          These phaenomena are
 strictly in accordance with the notion of a wave coming up
 from the north-west and passing on towards the south-east,
 the direction in which the great symmetrical wave of 1842
 travelled: as the anterior slope or front of the wave approached,
 the barometric readings would be lowest at the south-eastern
 stations, while the reverse would occur as the posterior slope
 or back of the wave passed off; the readings in the north-west
 would be lower than those in the south-east.
     On        its
              last return observations were made                the great            on

 362         Dr.   Page on the probable Conduction                 of
as perfect insulators,      or rather non-conductors                of galvanic
  electricity, might under certain circumstances prove conduct
  ors. I    took two large sheets of zinc and coiled them toge
  ther, the two sheets being separated by a layer of India rub
  ber cloth.     The sheets of zinc were connected respectively
  with the poles of a battery, and when the battery consisted of
  a single pair, no appreciable current passed from plate to
  plate through the India rubber cloth.             When however the
  battery consisted of twenty compound pairs, a slight current
  passed, as indicated by a delicate galvanoscope.             made no  I
  further investigation or application of this fact till 1843, when
  recurrence was had to this feature to solve some difficulties
  experienced in the projection of a line of Morse's telegraph
  between this place and Baltimore.           Ten miles of lead pipe
  containing four well-insulated wires had been laid in the
 ground, and upon trying these wires respectively, making the
  wire one-half of the circuit, and the lead pipe the
  with a battery of intensity, a current could be established
                                                                    ...i.
  through any one of the three extra wires. Being consulted
 by Prof. Morse as to the probable cause of this cross firing, as
 it was technically called, the solution seemed to me to be ob
 vious in view of the above experiment.             The reasoning was
 sufficiently plausible to induce Prof. Morse to abandon the
 undertaking of the pipe, and resort to his original plan of
 raising the wire upon posts.          The explanation was simply
 this, viz. that the insulating or non-conducting material would
 under any circumstances conduct the current; but that in some
 cases the amount transmitted could not be appreciated by
 any known test however delicate, was a postulate subsequently
 borne out. Does not such a conclusion follow directly from
 the law of Pouillet, that the conducting power of wires is
 directly as their cross section and some inverse ratio of their
 length, in connexion with the well-established laws of the dif
 ferent conducting powers of metals?             For example, copper
having from four to six times the conducting power of iron, a
 wire of iron, to equal in this respect a wire of copper, should
be of from four to six times the size.         Let this rule be applied
to poorer conductors, and we may infer that the poorest con
ductor, or what has been usually considered a non-conductor,
would become a conductor, if the area of its cross section
were indefinitely increased and         its  length remained nearly
nothing.    In    the caseof     the wiresin   the lead pipe—the one
for instance    joining  the two   polesof  the battery—is separated
             lying              and the lead pipe,        by
                                                           layer

the length of ten miles would give a surface of 550 square
feet, while the length of the conductor would be only the
thickness of the material, and a constant quantity, for any
length of wires and tube, and increase of surfaces in contact,
A full realization of the principle appears in the fact, that
although the earth is a much poorer conductor than copper,
mass for mass, yet upon the telegraphic routes it is found that
the earth is a much better conductor than the copper wires
used, the mass of the former being indefinitely greater than
the latter.
   These phaenomena induced me to try the following expe
riment, in order to ascertain if the air might not act as a con
ductor.     The roof of the patent office building covered with
copper, exposes to the air twenty-two thousand square feet of
this metal, and thus affords an enormous surface for conduc
tion.   A wire was connected with the metal of the roof, an
other wire with a plate of zinc of about four square feet. The
free ends of these two wires were connected with a galvano
scope of exceeding sensitiveness, and with matters thus ar
ranged, the zinc plate was insulated from the earth and build
ing in the open air, and when the upper surface of the zinc
plate was moistened with water, or what proved still better,
acidulated water, the needle of the galvanoscope was deflected
from two to five degrees.       There was a slight drizzling rain
at the time.    Before the zinc plate was moistened no action
was noticed.     The inference from this experiment seems
safely to warrant the position that a moist atmosphere con
ducts galvanic electricity.      Many years since proposed in I
this Journal a  plan  for  ascertaining  the level of the water in
steam-boilers consisting of a zinc plate or a pair of plates,
which should indicate the failure of water in the boiler by the
cessation of action upon a galvanoscope placed in any conve
nient position outside the boiler.                  I
                                          have never had oppor
tunity to test this device, but was at the time somewhat ap
prehensive that pure steam might act as a conductor and thus
defeat the invention.            I
                            have recently been informed, though
not in a direct manner,    that the experiment had been tried in
Philadelphia, and that the steam acted as a conductor. Whe

allowed the   expression.   The needle does not take a sudden
start and return as when influenced by lightning, but moves
gradually without oscillation to some fixed point, from which
it will return sometimes in two minutes and sometimes in ten
or fifteen minutes. An extended series of observations will be
necessary before any deductions can be safely made.        If the
wires should be separated by a slight interval during a thunder
storm, doubtless electrical sparks would be visible.     During
heavy storms, a flash of   lightning twenty  miles distant from
the wires of Morse's telegraph will induce electricity in the
wire sufficient to operate the magnets and work the telegraph,
sometimes recording several signals.     A flash of lightning in
Baltimore, forty miles distant from this place, will operate the
magnet at this end of the line.

   Buckwheat (Polygonum Fagopyrum) constitutes an excep
tion to this remark.      In the table of analytical results+ this
grain has a nitrogen per-centage of 2:40, while two ordinary
varieties of wheat (Triticum vulgare) have 2.33 and 2:30 per
cent.     Buckwheat meal from Vienna gave, as shown below,
1:08 per cent.       Buckwheat grains (Polygonum tartaricum)
from the    experimental   field of Hohenheim Agricultural Insti
tute, gave 1.56 per cent. of nitrogen, while the analysis of
three superior varieties of wheat grown in the same field, gave
respectively 2:59, 2.68 and 2.69 per cent.                This species of
buckwheat was further found to contain 22.66 per cent. of
woody fibre.
    The equivalent value of buckwheat, according to Boussin
gault, wheat being 100, is 108. The following analyses gave
for      its
         equivalent value 170; for that                             of

   Difficulty presented itself also in the combustion of the beets
and other roots, arising from the extreme compactness of the
substance when dried.      It was however overcome by the me
thod  already  mentioned.
   The per-centage of woody fibre was determined in the fol
lowing manner. Grains, such as had been analysed, were
digested upon a sand-bath, several weeks, in diluted hydro
chloric acid, one part of acid to a thousand of water. At
intervals of from eight to ten days the fluid was poured off,
and the digestion resumed with diluted acid, as before. After
several weeks, the woody fibre not appearing wholly freed
from other substances, an equally dilute solution of caustic
potassa was employed, and the digestion therewith continued.
At the end of two months, the woody fibre of the oats, barley
and buckwheat, were poured upon filters, thoroughly washed
with distilled water, and dried at 100° C. The hulls of the
peas and beans were treated with diluted caustic potassa alone,
and similarly determined.

  The carbon and hydrogen so estimated, deducted from the
whole per-centage of carbon and hydrogen, gave what belonged
to the starch, gum, sugar, &c. The oxygen of the latter was
estimated from the carbon by the formula C12 Hio Olot.

LVIII.    Microscopic Observations on the Perforation of the Ca
  pillaries by the Corpuscles of the Blood, and on the Origin
  of Mucus and Pus-globules. By AUGUSTUs WALLER, M.D.”
                          [Continued from p. 287.]
  N the   preceding Number of this Journal I have already given
     a brief outline of some observations respecting the manner
in which the white corpuscles of the blood are seen to leave
the interior of the capillary vessels.      As this subject is inti
mately connected with the formation or origin of the globules
found in mucus and purulent matter, it deserves a close and
strict investigation.
   In the first place, we must bear in mind that the blood con
sists of transparent fluid parts containing two kinds of particles
in suspension; the one of a red colour and a flattened disc-like
shape, and the other nearly transparent and spherical.           The
examination of the tongue of the frog, or of any other trans
parent part of a living animal, shows these globules and cor
puscles generally circulating together through the capillaries.
    The examination of mucus and purulent matter shows that
they contain great quantities of globules, which are exactly
similar to the spherical corpuscles found in the blood.         In all
these instances these     particles  are     of
                                              spherical
                                                a       form,  trans
parent    or whitish, granulated, and about the size       of
                                                          Tägth  ofa
millimetre.     In  acetic acid they contract,     the alkalies they

are   quickly  broken   up,   inwater  they swell and are disaggre
gated into separate minute granules.
    The corpuscles       of
                         blood     in
                                    the mammiferae and       the frog

 these bodies in pus, mucus and in the blood, I may mention
 that I have before me drawings of mucus and purulent glo
 bules, and of the corpuscles obtained from man and from some
 of the cold-blooded animals. All these drawings have been
carefully executed under the camera lucida, at different times;
 and they resemble each other so closely as to render it impos
 sible to give any distinctive character to recognise one from
the other.
    In consequence of this striking resemblance, observers have
 already supposed that the corpuscles of the blood give rise to
 those found in mucus and pus, and that these are simply cor
puscles extravasated or filtered from the blood. An important
observation has moreover corroborated this theory, namely
that of the accumulation of the corpuscles at the inner sides
of vessels which are subjected to any prolonged irritation.
This theory has principally been known in this country from
the talented observations of Mr. W. Addison.
    On the other hand, it has appeared to other physiologists
so improbable to suppose the perforation of the capillary ves
sels by the corpuscles, that they have come to the conclusion
that they are not derived from the blood, but, like semen or
milk, are formed on the secreting surface, in virtue of some
plastic power of the fluids which are effused upon                This           it.

After exposure to the air for two or three hours it was again

In    some places, the indentures formed                 the extravasated
 corpuscles were         deep that the vessel appeared

 disconnected; and such was sometimes really the case; but

400    Dr. Waller      on the   Origin of Mucus and Pus-globules.
 generally the diameter was only much decreased without being
 entirely disconnected, so as to interrupt the course of the
 blood.    I have sometimes seen vessels of considerable size
 with an internal rapid current, the tubes of which at some
 places were contracted to one-fifth of the size which they
 presented elsewhere. It is easy to explain this, if we suppose
 that on some occasion they had been perforated by corpuscles
 and narrowed as I have described.
    The corpuscles do not escape merely from vessels desti- -
 tute of internal current.     Capillaries with a most rapid current
 are often seen to be uneven, with slight indentations along
 their sides, and at a short distance external corpuscles which
 are more numerous opposite the indentations.         In these cases,
 the various   analogies  visible with    regard to the indentations
 and the corpuscles situated directly opposite to them outside
 the vessel, show that the vessel must have given them pas
 sage in the same manner as when the blood is stagnant or in
 a state of feeble oscillation.    The larger trunks never present
 any distinct indentations to mark the passage of the corpuscle
 through them; but at their exterior corpuscles are fre
 quently seen collected in abundance, which renders it pro
bable that the parietes of these also may be dissolved to allow
of the passage of these particles, which, however, must not be
confounded with that condition which I have termed extra
fibrination.    A careful observer will easily distinguish the glo
bular particles of what is probably condensed or coagulated
fibrine, from the corpuscles, as they are much more minute
and have no granular structure.
    The results of other experiments performed in the same
way are so similar to the above, that it would be a needless
repetition to detail them. When an animated being is the
subject, there must necessarily be some slight variation in the
results.    Thus in some of my observations I find a difference
in the period which elapses before the injection and engorge
ment takes place, and the succeeding phaenomena are likewise
affected in proportion.      I will briefly mention another obser
vation, as it was attended with a loss of blood, and may serve
in some respects to elucidate the influence of depletion on ca
pillary circulation.

surface thus appeared to be of a muscular nature. The most
ready and correct representation of these diffused striae, is by
covering a piece of paper with prints of the papillae of the top
of the finger, which has been previously rubbed over with a
little printer's ink, in other words, making finger-marks on
the paper; when, by drawing parallel lines among these
printed papillae, a most faithful image is obtained.
    With regard to other appearances presented by the capil
laries, they will be found described in my former communica

    Those who have patience to watch for several hours the
phaenomena which occur in the capillaries, will perceive the
great increase that takes place in the diameters of those under
the influence of prolonged irritation, particularly at the edges
nearest the irritating agents employed to secure the organ.
After watching these changes, it will be seen how slight a cause,
such as a temporary obstruction of a vessel by a few globules,
is sufficient to determine whether the increase in volume shall
be confined to one vessel or be divided among two or more.
 Therefore we can readily comprehend how the same causes
in operation on the embryo may create                those anomaliesall

 1846.                        F.R.S.
   The author denies the existence of two electric fluids, and main
tains that all the phenomena are explicable on the hypothesis of a
single fluid ; which when present in a conducting body renders it
positive, and in a non-conducting body, negative; but a body which
is naturally a conductor, may, he asserts, be rendered otherwise, by
changing          its
              form.

    The appearance in question, seen between five and six o'clock in
 the evening of the 2nd of December 1845, was that of a large flame
 far out at sea, flickering several times for fifteen and twenty minutes,
 and suddenly ceasing. It was conjectured to have been either a
 large ship on fire, or a volcanic eruption; but no positive data exist
 for determining the question.
     “On the Fossil Remains of the soft parts of Foraminifera dis
 covered in the Chalk and Flint of the South-east of England.” By
 Gideon Algernon Mantell, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.
    By subjecting small portions of calcareous rock to the action of
diluted hydrochloric acid, the calcareous earth and the shells it had
enveloped were removed; the residue consisting of particles of
quartz and of green silicate of iron; and also numerous remains of
the soft parts of animalcules, chiefly Xanthidia and Rotaliae. The
organization of the latter appears, from the observations of Ehren
berg, to be very simple, and to have no relation with the Cephalo
poda, as was formerly imagined. The body is enclosed within the
shell, which is polythalamous, and it occupies not only the outer cham
ber, but also      all
                   the cells contemporaneously, and the shell          pierced     is
all  over with minute    pores,   through    which tentacula   protrude;   and
there are also several soft transparent feelers,                  or

the quantity and chemical constituents of the ingesta and egesta
during ten days; at the end of which time he had gained one pound

carbon and   hydrogen contained in the food of animals, which enter
into combination with the respired oxygen, forming carbonic acid
and water, do not generate sufficient heat for the purposes of animal
life; and that consequently there must be some other sources of
heat in the animal economy, one of which he believes to be the
secretion of carbon.
   “Electro-Physiological Researches.—Fourth Memoir. On the
Physiological  Action of the Electric Current.”        By Charles Mat
teucci.   Communicated     by Michael   Faraday,  Esq.,  LL.D., F.R.S.
   In the prosecution  of his inquiries  on the  physiological action of
electric currents, the author found it necessary to employ an appa
ratus, which was expressly made for him by M. Bréguet, adapted
to the delicate appreciation of the intensity of the force of the mus
cular contractions excited by those currents; of which apparatus
he gives a minute description, illustrated by a drawing.               He was
thus enabled to institute an exact comparison between the contrac
tions caused by the direct, and those by the reverse currents, both
at the commencement and at the termination of their action.                 The
following are the general conclusions he deduces from the experi
ments thus conducted.
    1. The passage of the electric current through a mixed nerve pro
duces a variation in the excitability of the nerve, differing essen
tially in degree, according to the direction of the current through
the nerve. This excitability is weakened and ultimately destroyed;
and this takes place more or less rapidly according as the direct
                         is,
current, that          current circulating through the nerve from the
                         a
centre      the periphery,
           to                     more
                                    is          or
                                         less intense.    On the other hand,
is, by
     the passage          of
                       the same current        the contrary direction, that
    from the periphery          the centre,
                                to                    or in
                                                the inverse current, the ex
citability     preserved and increased.

                                                                                              is or on by

the current ceasing.           If
                               the nerve             be

             The author is of opinion that the evidence on which the modern
          theory of the composition of water is founded, is fallacious; and
          believing water to be a simple body, he conceives that it forms
          hydrogen by combining with the electric fluid, which he imagines
          to be identical with the phlogiston of former chemists.     He cites
          the opinions of Priestley, Cavendish and Watt, as corroborating his
          views, and interprets their experiments in conformity with the hypo
          thesis he has adopted.

             The author conceives that in negatively electrified bodies, or
          bodies having less than their natural quantity of electricity, the re
          dundant matter must have a tendency to escape, and thus the equi
          librium of          its
                         cohesion   destroyed; and that two bodies
                                                     is                  such                                             in               a

     every trace of acid; but when the acid from the white infusible
     chloride, after    I
                        had separated it as well as possible from the yellow
!    one, was again mixed with charcoal and treated with chlorine,                                I
     constantly obtained yellow and white chloride; less, it is true, of the
     first than when the mixture of the two acids as they occur in the
    mineral was employed; but even when the operation was very fre
    quently repeated with the acid from the white chloride, it was not
    possible to obtain by this method a pure white chloride free from
     yellow.     Iobserved however that the white chloride was only par
    tially sublimed. When it was separated as much as possible from
    the yellow chloride, and by sublimation also from a white non-vola
     tile residue, it at last afforded an acid, which on treatment with
     charcoal and chlorine yielded a tolerably pure, white, wholly vola
     tile chloride, the chloride of niobium.          The white fixed residue
    yielded with charcoal and chlorine a large quantity of yellow chlo
    ride; and after removing this by sublimation, again left a white non
     volatile residue, which, on being again subjected to a similar treat
    ment, afforded the same products.
         On comparing this behaviour of the yellow chloride with that
     observed on treating a mixture of pure tantalic acid and charcoal
    with chlorine, I obtained a perfectly similar yellow chloride and a
     white non-volatile residue; but the quantity was far smaller, and                           its
     production could          entirely avoided

    Chloride of tantalium dissolves in hydrochloric acid in the cold to
 a turbid liquid, which after some length of time forms an opaline
jelly, from which cold and boiling water dissolve only traces of tan
 talic acid.      But if chloride of tantalium is treated with boiling hy
 drochloric acid, it does not dissolve entirely, and on cooling it does not
 form a jelly, but water now dissolves the whole of it to an opaline
 liquid, which is not rendered more turbid by boiling. Sulphuric

     This new metal was discovered by M. Hermann in a mineral which
he supposed at first to be yttro-columbite,              which he now proposes to
call yttro-ilmenite, since it contains no columbic acid. The ilme
nium which occurs in this mineral is in a form that has many cha
racters in common with columbic acid, but is distinguished from it by
several others; for example the density of ilmenic acid is much less
than that of columbic acid; it becomes very yellow by calcination;

process forms white firm masses which have a conchoidal fracture
and no lustre.
   During calcination, ilmenic acid assumes a fine golden tint; and
the acid obtained from the hydrate becomes, under these circum
stances, of a deeper colour than the acid prepared by calcining the

by spontaneous evaporation; the solution becomes gradually turbid
by the action of the carbonic acid of the air, and deposits a white
powder of acidulous ilmenate of soda.
   When ferrocyanide of potassium, and afterwards hydrochloric acid,
are added to a solution of ilmenate of soda, a precipitate of a deeper
brown colour than hydrate is produced; tincture of galls acts similarly.
   Hydrate and subsulphate of ilmenium do not dissolve in acids;
acid solutions of ilmenic acid cannot therefore be prepared for the
purpose of acting upon zinc.; but if the hydrate or subsulphate re
cently precipitated be moistened with hydrochloric acid, and then
exposed to the action of zinc, a grayish-blue colour is produced.
   With borax and with a phosphate, ilmenic acid produces glass
both in the interior and exterior flame of the blowpipe, which appears
to be yellow, but which becomes colourless on cooling. This metal is
so named from the Ilmen mountains near Miask, in which the mineral
containing it is found.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Octobre 1846.
   [It is very probable that this new metal may prove to be nothing
more than pelopium described in the preceding paper. In a commu
nication with which we have been favoured, Prof. Rose states “that
he cannot venture to decide in what relation the ilmenic acid stands
to pelopic acid, from the few properties which M. Hermann has
described. According to him, ilmenic acid acquires a golden-yellow
colour on ignition, while pelopic acid, according to my experiments,
only becomes yellowish.          The most important character of ilmenic
acid, by which it differs essentially from tantalic and niobic acid, is
said to be that it is precipitated entirely by hydrochloric acid from the
solution of      soda salt; while pelopic acid, according

 It  appears to result from the observations of MM. Einbrodt and
 Unger, that the substance lately found in guano by the latter is not
 identical with xanthic oxide; according to them xanthic oxide is
 C*H*N*O°; and guanine, which was mistaken for the same substance,
 is  C5 H5N5   O.
     M.  Unger   also observes that guanine yields, by nitric acid, an acid
 which    crystallizes  in small regular prisms, which are but slightly
 soluble in  water,  and possess the composition of uric acid, plus oxygen
 and the elements of water.        M. Unger confines himself to indicating
 Cio Ho N*     O',   which  probably relates to the anhydrous and hypo
 thetical  acid;   to this must be added Hº O in order to designate the
 real and free acid, that is C10 H13 NS O10, or rather C5 H6 N4 O5 in
 M. Gerhardt's notation.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Septembre

 TINCTURE OF LOGWOOD            AS A  TEST FOR BICARBONATE        OF LIME.
     M. Dupasquier states that he employs spirituous tincture of logwood
 to discover bicarbonate of lime in spring water; according to this
  chemist the tincture should be prepared, either cold or with heat,
  with logwood recently cut and divided. The tincture has a brownish
  colour, and three or four drops being added, instantly communicates
  a fine violet colour to water which contains the least trace of bicar
 bonate of lime.       In a water which contains any other salt of lime,
  it occasions only a pale yellowish colour.
     Selenitic waters, containing bicarbonate of lime, give the former
  appearance when cold, whereas after being boiled so as to decompose
  the last bicarbonate, the second reaction ensues from the sulphate
  of lime.
     According to M. Dupasquier, the bicarbonate of lime, which is
  held in solution either in spring or river water, acts upon the colour
'ing principle of the logwood in the same manner as the alkalies or
  the soluble neutral alkaline carbonates.—Journ.          de Chim. Méd.,

           ON THE TREATMENT OF OSMIURET OF               IRIDIUM.
     Instead of acting upon the osmiuret of iridium by calcination with
  common salt in a current of chlorine, M. Fritzsche prefers fusing
  this mineral with a mixture of chlorate and caustic potash.
     For this purpose he fuses over a lamp, in a capacious porcelain
  crucible, equal parts of the chlorate of potash and caustic potash,
  and introduces the osmiuret of iridium.        If the heat be continued,
  the  oxygen    which is set free attacks the  mineral, which is soon ob
  servable by the yellowish-brown colour of the mass; this swells
  considerably and becomes gradually thicker; as soon as the action
  is over the product is black and sinks.        During this operation no
  vapour of osmium is disengaged; but some is produced if the heating
  of the mass is continued; this is, however, useless as soon as the
  action is complete and the mass has become soluble in water. Sixty

parts of osmiuret of iridium require ten parts each of chlorate and
hydrate of potash, and the operation may be conveniently performed
over a lamp in a porcelain crucible; it requires about half an hour.—

                          ANHYDROUS ALCOHOL,
  M. Casoria proposes to employ perfectly dry sulphate of copper
to render alcohol anhydrous, and also to employ it as a test for as
certaining that it is perfectly free from water.  For these purposes
he saturates  alcohol, of 83°  by the instrument of Gay-Lussac, with
fused chloride of calcium: he distilled one-third of the liquid, and
to about 7500 grains he added a small quantity of the anhydrous sul
phate, and kept the mixture in a well-closed bottle which was shaken
occasionally.    The salt, by combining with the water of the alcohol,
resumes its blue colour, and fresh portions of the salt are to be added
till the blue colour ceases to be produced: the alcohol after distilla
tion may then be considered anhydrous.
    To determine the absence of water from alcohol, a small quantity
of dry sulphate of copper is to be put into a glass tube and the alco
hol poured upon it : if no colour be generated the alcohol may be
regarded as anhydrous.       In performing this experiment it is requi
site to   keep  the tube  closed,  as the moisture of the atmosphere
would interfere with the     accuracy  of the result.—Journ. de Chim.

 ACTION OF FERROCYANIDE OF POTASSIUM ON THE TARTRATE
               AND CITRATE OF IRON, ETC.
   M. Calloud remarks, that on examining the action of ferrocyanide
of potassium on the tartrate and citrate of iron, some remarkable
reactions occur, which are not common to all the salts of iron.
   The neutral tartrate of iron, like the neutral citrate, is precipitated
by the alkaline ferrocyanides, like all the other persalts of iron; but
the precipitate formed does not possess                    all

   The distilled product is then put into a porcelain vessel with ex
cess of hydrated carbonate of zinc, and digested on a sand-bath for
two or three hours at a temperature of 194°Fahr.; the liquor, fil
tered while hot, is evaporated over the naked fire until there remains
about a pint of it; and the evaporation is to be continued to dryness
on plates in a stove.
   By this process M. Lefort obtained at three different times 262,
277, and 284 grains of valerianate of zinc from about two pounds of
valerian root.
   When it is intended to employ valerian root for the preparation
of valerianate of zinc, it is requisite to have it fresh dried; the author
obtained considerable difference of product when using the recently
and long-dried root.
   It is even probable that valerian root does not always contain the
same proportion of oil at different times of the year, it being well
known that the leaves of the lauro-cerasus yield different quantities
of hydrocyanic acid at different seasons.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch.,

  light,
          explanation of the phaenomenon of the aberration of
             as given in most of the established treatises on astro
nomy, seems for at least a long time past, to have been generally
acquiesced in ; until at the meeting of the British Association,
1845t, the subject was stirred anew by the announcement of
the investigations of Prof. Challis and Mr. Stokes, the discus
sion of which has been continued in so many numbers of the
Philosophical Magazine (vols. xxvii. xxviii.), and which seemed
to open a new epoch in the history of the question.
   The first impressions taken, and the reports which obtain
currency in such a case, are not always to be trusted.                But
we were    given   to understand that we had hitherto been                             all
along under     an entire mistake with regard         aberration; that
                                                              to

    the existing  interpretations            of
                                           were   unsatisfactory;
                                                  it                 that
in    fact remained         this day wholly unexplained; that
                               to                                                      all
previous writers had failed           showing the modus operandi;

priate idea” was wholly wanting, until now for the first time
supplied.     Some again understood              have been asserted,
                                                   it   to

                                     well     celestial, are subject

426      Prof. Powell on the Theory of the Aberration of Light.
    Again, the question was mixed up with the undulatory
theory.     It seemed to be considered, at least by some, that a
lengthy and abstruse analytical investigation was now neces
sary for anything like a complete explanation of what our
predecessors thought sufficiently made out by a short popular
illustration, or at most a simple geometrical construction.
    On some of these points the two very able mathematicians
who first started the question were themselves at issue: and
though some other points, at first involved in paradox and
mystery, were in some degree cleared up in the course of
the discussion, yet it cannot be denied that much still re
mained which called for further elucidation; and even yet it
cannot be said that the minds of the scientific world in ge
neral have been brought to any agreement, or perhaps any
such clear and definite view of the real state of the case as to
be able to come to a final decision, or to render useless an
attempt to divest the question of some of the ambiguity and
difficulty in which it has been involved.
    I trust then it will not be deemed superfluous                period           if,   at   a
when the immediate         controversy    seems       have arrived      to                         at
                                                                                                    a
termination,      offer few remarks which may assist
                  I             a                               forming                  in
a   dispassionate judgement                     on
                                       the merits       the discussion;      of

                       so
                       I    premise    that the chief point really                                  at
issue seems to me               to
                           lie rather       the general nature of the
                                                         in
reasoning and the principles            philosophical logic involved,

                              which the controversialists have more
immediately addressed themselves.
I     will then first advert      the question respecting the exist

observation that the vane at the mast-head took a direction
intermediate to that of the wind and of the boat: and the
analogy was obvious between the direction in which the wind
seemed by this indew to come to the boat in motion, and that
in which the light from a star seems to come to the earth in
motion; the illustration however is but vague and general.
And in the explanations thus adopted generally, that there was
still something wanting to give a firm grasp to the apprehen
sion, appears clearly, as well from the loose and wavering con
ceptions betrayed in some of the speculations of that time con
nected with the subject, as in the partial endeavours made by
others to fix the view of it more precisely.
   It is perhaps a proof of the defective ideas prevalent on
the subject, that on the occasion of the transit of Venus, 1769,
Bliss and Hornsby should both have calculated the effect of
aberration as accelerating the phases of the transit; while
Prof. Winthorp of Cambridge, United States”, contended by
means of a detailed illustration (imagining balls fired at a ship
in motion), that the effect ought to be that of retardation, in
which he was supported by Dr. Price+.
   A question somewhat of the same kind was also debated
among the French astronomers; Monnier, Bailly and Cassini,
contending that in a transit of a planet it was only necessary
to consider the aberration of the sun; while Lalande intro
duced the difference of the aberrations of the sun and planet:
and the former principle was defended by M. Jeaurat, on the
ground that the planet was dark, and             existence only shown        its
by   the light        of
                   the sun  surrounding                                itf.
   The elaborate discussion         Eulery contributes little perhaps
                                                    of
to  the precise explanation.       He treats the whole subject                                                     in

neglecting the changes in the earth's motion during the pas
sage of light, the apparent place of the sun, or of any star
or planet, is            its
                    true geocentric place for the instant        which                                   at

justified; and the explanation being complete, it is wholly

the above explanation, it may be said, only requires to have it
shown that the two rays do actually assume the same direction

 refrangibility of light, the rainbow is perfectly explained with
out reference to the undulatory or any other theory of the
nature of light.          Yet it is material to the truth of that theory
that it should         explain   the dispersion; and if it did so, as it
confessedly explains the laws of reflexion and refraction, it
would explain the rainbow, which is a mere consequence from
them.
    In other words, the aberration is not an independent pro
perty of light, like refraction or polarization, which require a
theory to explain them, but the result                                  (if

it is

    On the other hand, there are some, who, not entirely falling

the facts which explain the aberration are so much more simple
and familiar that we feel satisfied almost without any theory
of them at all.

This circle touched the halos (1 and 2 at IV.), and     centre                            its

                           at

   This appearance continued until             10”, then the halo (III.),

442       A Simple      Demonstration              of a remarkable Proposition
  1*     45". The phaenomenon  had finally disappeared, and the
haze in which these halos were formed had passed away and
the sun again shone brightly.
    From 2 till 3" a rain-cloud passed along the south-east
horizon, but it never rose higher than 15°.
    At 4" much cumuli passed over together with some scud,
and a few drops of rain fell. In a few minutes the sky was
clear with the exception of few cumuli.    Starlight night until
11", then overcast. A near resemblance to this phaenomenon
was noticed at Derby on the 16th of June 1843. (See page 32
of Lowe's Atmospheric Phaenomena.)
    The 18th had been a thorough rainy day, and 1.4% inch
fell; the wind was from the south-east, with the barometer
stationary at 29.296 inches” until 8h when it began to rise;
at 9h it had reached 29.307 inches; it continued to rise all

    Thus let---A B D G be the solid.                                                     A.
By supposition,                      c=4,

as above demonstrated, when                       c=5.
   In the same manner, the proposition being true for 5                                   cor
mers, must be true for 6.

        Observations on the Table of Anhydrous Potash.
   The strongest solution of potash that I could prepare at
the temperature of 62°F. had the sp. gr. of 1:5607. Its che
mical strength was 810°.     This was determined by neutrali
zation with    pure  sulphuric  acid of 100°.    Its formula is
KO, 6; HºO. According to Karsten the specific gravity of
anhydrous potash is about 2.656, which gives 31.73 septems
for the volume of the test atom; but Dalton’s specific gravity
of the hydrate of potash gives the very same number for the
volume of anhydrous potash. As it is improbable that pot
ash and water would combine to form the first hydrate with
out condensation,          I
                      conclude that Karsten has merely calcu
lated the   specific gravity   of anhydrous potash from the
specific gravity of the hydrate.
   The condensation effected by potash is considerable, nearly
approaching to that effected by sulphuric acid. In a solution
of 1° the condensation per atom is 93 septems, being three
times the measure of the anhydrous potash which causes                                                        it.

           AUTHoRITIES.—The         specific gravity      of the anhydrous salt is
        quoted from Karsten.        The rest of this Table is from my own
        experiments.
        Observations on the Table                   of Carbonate of         Potash.
    The strongest solution of carbonate of potash that can be
 formed at 62°F. has a specific gravity of 1:57.39 and a che
 mical strength of 665°.                Its formula is KO, CO2 + 7H2O.
 The greatest amount of condensation occurs in this first solu
 tion, where the measure of the test atom of carbonate of
 potash decreases at once from 54-66 septems to 37-46 septems,
 effecting a condensation of 17:20 septems.                           In a solution of

                 Aqueous Solutions        of Acids      and Alkalies.                    447
1° the atomic measure is diminished to — 27-66 septems, the
                                                  -
condensation effected by 1 test atom being 82.32 septems.
    According to Messrs. Playfair and Joule (Phil. Magazine,
vol. xxviii. p. 506), the atomic measure of carbonate of pot
ash in solution is equal to that of water [namely, 16-07
septems]. This is correct when the strength of the solution
is about 70°, but not under any other circumstances; since
at 400° the measure is twice as much, at 10° the measure is
nothing, at 3° it is minus one volume, and at 1° it is minus
two volumes.
    The fraction which + 1 indicates the mean specific gravity
of 100° of carbonate of potash is (1.2643+18.295 =) 069106.

448              .        Mr. Griffin       on the Constitution     of
          Observations on the Table                   of Anhydrous Soda.
   The strongest solution of anhydrous soda, prepared at 62°
F., has  a chemical strength of 700° and a density of 1:4. Its
formula is NaO + 9H*O. The greatest condensation occurs
in this solution, where the test atom of soda effects at once
a condensation exceeding its own volume.     The atomic mea
sure of the uncombined soda is 1991 septems, and that of
the soda in the strongest solution is     1:30 septem.     –
                                                         Hence
a decigallon of this solution contains seven times 391 grs. of
anhydrous soda, in addition to more water than would fill the
vessel if no soda was present.       It is impossible to obtain
any solution of soda at 62°F., a decigallon of which does not
contain more than a decigallon of water.           have already      I
noticed the fact, that 1000 septems of water, when saturated
with anhydrous sulphuric acid, produce 5227 septems of so
lution. By way of contrast, I may state that 1000 septems
of water, when saturated with 140 septems of anhydrous
soda, produce only 991 septems of solution; and yet the con
densation effected by 1 test atom of soda in a solution of this
kind, is only one-third part of that which it effects in a solu
tion of    1°.
            At that stage                   of
                             dilution the condensation effected
by 140 septems                  of
                      anhydrous soda amounts          about 400          to
septems.

        Observations on the Table                           of Carbonate of Soda.
   The strongest solution of carbonate of soda prepared at
62°F. has the sp. gr. of 1166, and a chemical strength of
185°.   Its formula is nearly NaO, CO2+33H2O. A solution
of sp. gr. 1:16657 deposited crystals while weighing at 62°F.
The solution of sp. gr. 1166, if cooled a little below 62°F.,
also deposits crystals.  The exact point of saturation is diffi
 cult to hit.       I
                 made many trials with perfectly pure materials,
 and always weighed a quantity that filled a bottle of the
 capacity of 3000 grs. of water. I believe that the sp. gr. 1:166
is very near the truth. It differs considerably however from
 the usual quotations.    Dr. Thomson states the specific gra
vity of a saturated solution at 584°F. to be 1.07516. This
is no doubt a misprint for 1' 17516.        Dr. Henry quotes the
specific gravity at the temperature of the atmosphere to be
 1.26.   This also seems to be a misprint for 1.16.
    The greatest amount of condensation occurs in the solution
of sp. gr. 1166, coincident with the greatest chemical strength
and greatest density, as is the case with solutions of           the                                   all
fixed alkalies described                in

452                 Mr. Griffin        on the Constitution             of
water, pass from the solid state to the liquid, and must ab
sorb as much heat as is necessary to give them fluidity. The
thermometric heat is the difference between the heat produced
by condensation and the cold produced by change of state,
and in the present example the heat predominates.
   But when 179.91 septems of hydrated or crystallized car
bonate of soda are dissolved in water, much cold is produced,
though not in consequence of the occurrence of the single
phaenomenon of change of state from solidity to fluidity.              It
is true, that the liquefaction of 179.91 septems of crystals,
and their dispersion through 23:29 atoms (=374.27 septems)
of additional water, producing a liquid compound of the bulk
of 540-54 septems, occasions the production of much cold,
yet it must be observed that the crystallized hydrate, in
forming this second hydrate, causes a condensation equal to
13-64 septems, which must unquestionably produce heat. But
since in this experiment the mass of matter to be liquefied is
almost five times greater than in the former example, while
the amount of condensation is one-third less, the single ther
mometric result of the solution is a fall in temperature. Here
then we have evidently that “exception” which M. Gay
Lussac was unable to find, that, namely, where “the heat
produced by hydration is less than the cold produced by
change of state.” And this exception, so far from being a
rarity, must occur in every case where the atomic measure of
the substance to be liquefied is large, and its power of con
densation but small. Without multiplying examples,                 think              I
I  may safely assume, that in
                                          is all
                                       cases                of

hydration and condensation, and the heat absorbed                 lique              by
faction  or  expansion.

   case no heat is disengaged, the whole effects                          of the cold     are
   thermometric.
      Gay-Lussac’s idea, that the production of cold on solution
   is evidence that the substance dissolved cannot form a hy
   drate, or become any further hydrated, appears to me to be
   erroneous.           How is it possible to account for the expansion
   which occurs on dissolving sal-ammoniac in a minimum of
   water, except by admitting the exercise of chemical action?
   or how account for the condensation it effects with a maximum
   of water, except by admitting the same agency? It seems to
   me, that hydration is evident in both cases, notwithstanding
   the production of cold. What other explanation also shall
   we give of the phaenomena attending the solution of crystal
   lized carbonate of soda? While in the very act of dissolving,
   under production of considerable cold, this salt simultane
   ously combines with an additional quantity of water, and
   causes a large amount of condensation. The heat disen
   gaged by this condensation, being spent in liquefying the
   crystallized hydrate, is not sensible to the thermometer, which
   only detects the cold that remains in excess.                            But since the
   condensation certainly takes place and can be measured, it
   proves the thermometer to be a very fallible and incompetent
   guide in this field of research.

   The measure of the test atom of ammonia, as existing in
various solutions, varies from 44:20 septems to 43.26 septems.
The mean of 14 examples is 43.73 septems.                The differences

that this third hydrate is easily obtainable at a temperature

the strongest I could prepare.

agree with the results of experiment? I cannot answer these
questions better than by giving an abstract of a series of ex

   The chemical strength of the solutions that were examined
was determined by neutralization with pure muriatic acid,
the strength of which was ascertained by means of carbonate
of soda and nitrate of silver. The specific gravities were
determined by weighing the liquors in stoppered glass bottles
at the temperature of 62°F.                              I
                                        have placed side by side the
theoretical densities and those determined by experiment, and
I have added a column of differences, to show in what cases
and to what extent the experimental specific gravity indicated
a greater or lesser chemical strength than the theoretical
specific gravity.             If
                        in any of these solutions there had oc
curred either condensation or expansion, it would be shown
in this column, where however are also shown                 the errors                    all
of experiment. These errors are very great                  the experi                 in

              Aqueous Solutions         of Acids and Alkalies.                              459
  The approximate coincidence of my experiments with Dr.
Ure's will perhaps be held to prove the correctness of his
opinion; and I must admit that there is some appearance of
the occurrence of a slight expansion at about 300°. Yet this
apparent expansion is so small, and the figures that indicate
it are so likely to be merely the expression of errors of ex
                   I
periment, that consider the expansion, though possible, not
by any means proved. The evidence tending to prove that
ammonia has a fixed atomic volume in solution, seems to me
greatly to preponderate over that which indicates expansion.
My doubts respecting the occurrence of expansion were fur
ther strengthened by the results of the following experi
ment.
   Into a long narrow graduated bottle I put 500 septems of
strong commercial ammonia, the degree of which was 810°. Its
specific gravity was 0-8985.72 by trial. By means of a bottle
so graduated as to deliver 500 septems of water, I added that
quantity to the ammonia. The bottle was stopped, wrapped
in a thick towel, and briskly shaken for about a minute.
Each liquor previous to the mixture was brought to the
temperature of 51° F. Immediately after the shaking, the
temperature was found to be 54°F.              Here was a rise of 3°,
indicating, not expansion, but condensation.
                                        its
                                                        When the                                li
quor had returned to 51°F.            volume was examined. There
certainly was      no
                    expansion.      I think there was slight con          a
densation, but     it  was   scarcely   measurable. The chemical
strength      ofthe diluted liquor was found             406°. This
                                                                 to   be
indicated condensation.         Its specific gravity was 950600,

   The results which     in this experiment indicate condensation
are, I   believe,   asremote from the truth                    as
                                                      those which                               in
other experiments seemed          indicate expansion. One

    These experiments show how difficult it is to determine
the amount of heat that is disengaged when liquors are mixed,
since the agitation necessary to effect the mixture can of
itself produce part of the rise of temperature which is attri
buted wholly to the chemical action of the substances mixed
together.

   Joule.    All these relate to the specific gravity of anhydrous sal-ammoniac.
   I have adopted the mean as the true number. The solutions are all described
  from my experiments, except the two marked Holker and Playfair and Joule.

462                     Mr. Griffin           on the Constitution                    of
             Observations on the Table                          of Sal-Ammoniac.
     I have adopted for  the weight of the test atom of sal-am
moniac Berzelius's number for muriatic acid, added to Thom
 son’s number for ammonia; my object being to afford a
 means of comparing solutions of sal-ammoniac at given
 strengths with those of muriatic acid and ammonia at the
 same strengths, quoted in other sections of this memoir.
    The strongest solution of sal-ammoniac at 62°F. has the
specific gravity of 1.077333 and the chemical strength of
306°. Its formula is probably H*Cl”, N*H6+16H2O.            This
 solution gives a considerable deposit of crystals when cooled
to 59° F. The measure of the test atom of the anhydrous
salt is 62.23 septems. When existing in the solution of 306°
its measure is increased to 70'10 septems.      When in a solu
tion of 1°        its
               measure      diminishedis  about 50 septems. At    to
 an  intermediate point, somewhere about 12°, the measure                                              of
the atom       in
                solution    the same  is that     the anhydrous  as              of
atom. Hence sal-ammoniac has no fixed volume            solution,                            in
but possesses the property       causing earpansion

                                                is

smaller atomic measure than ammonia plus muriatic acid when
the latter   is    point

attempt      to
            determine the atomic measure        ammonia from                  of
knowledge         of
                the atomic measures        muriatic acid and      of                                   of a

  The fraction which + 1 indicates the mean specific gravity
of 100° of sal-ammoniac is (53257+16.071=) -033150.
   It follows from what has been stated, that the real specific
gravity of solutions of sal-ammoniac must be less than the
mean specific gravity when the chemical strength is above
12°, and greater than the mean specific gravity when the
chemical strength is below 12°.

  The following experiments were made to determine the
correctness of the number assumed for the atomic weight of
sal-ammoniac.
   1. A solution of 66.763 grs. of sal-ammoniac mixed with a
solution of 212-864 grs. of crystallized nitrate of silver, re
quired half a septem of solution of nitrate of silver of 10° to
complete the precipitation.
   2. A solution of 66.96 grs. of sal-ammoniac (Berzelius’s.
number) mixed with a solution of 212.864 grs. of nitrate of
silver, required 3 septems of solution of nitrate of silver of 10°
to complete the precipitation.
   These experiments tend to prove that, taking for granted
the accuracy of Berzelius's number for nitrate of silver, his
number for sal-ammoniac is too high. But                      if,
                                                        the above   as
experiments seem       show, 667-63
                         to             the correct number for
                                                  is
sal-ammoniac, then 212°5      the correct number for ammonia,
                                     is

cupies no space in solution. The solution which corresponds
to this turning-point has a chemical strength of about 50°,
and a specific gravity of nearly 1:05. Were a solution of sul
phate of magnesia to be carefully made with proportions of
salt and water corresponding to this stage of dilution, the re
sult would appear to corroborate the late experiments of
Dalton and of Messrs. Playfair and Joule, and thus a very
accurate experiment might be made to support a very falla
cious theory.
   This last remark applies equally to many other substances
whose examination is described in this memoir, and it shows
the danger of drawing a sweeping conclusion from the results
of any single experiment, however accurately performed.
Thus, in the case of sulphuric acid, if we were to adopt the
rash principle of deciding upon the atomic measure from the
results of a single experiment, we could prove the atomic
measure of that acid to be 2 volumes, or 1 volume, or nothing,
or less than nothing; in short, anything we pleased between
plus 34 septems and minus 68 septems; for we could pick
out an accurate experiment to yield any numerical product
that best suited a given purpose within those limits.

thereby produced.       Thus through solar influence two causes
are  brought  into  operation   at the same time, which produce
opposite effects on the pressure of the atmosphere, —the one
tending to make it lighter, the other heavier.
   By a careful registration of the hourly alterations of both
the wet and the dry-bulb thermometers, we may obtain,_first,
a knowledge of the daily changes of temperature near the
surface of the earth; and secondly, of the extent to which eva
poration keeps down the temperature in the wet-bulb thermo
meter: and from the extent to which temperature is thus
kept down in the wet-bulb thermometer, we may infer the
energy with which vapour is produced from wet surfaces,
and thrown into the air to increase the aggregate atmospheric
pressure.    If the daily fluctuations of the barometer were pro
duced   by these two influences alone, those influences might,
without much difficulty, be traced to their results, and their
separate as well as their joint effects might be exhibited in
the movements of the barometer.
   But in most of the cases where registrations of the two     in
struments have been furnished, the barometric fluctuations
have not been found to accord with the increase of vapour
produced by evaporation.          From sunrise until about ten
o'clock in the morning evaporation generally proceeds with
considerable energy, and a consequent increase of vapour
pressure may be traced in a rise of the barometer; but after
that time any increase of vapour pressure on the barometer
ceases: yet that evaporation continues active afterwards is
shown by the effect that is produced by it on the wet-bulb
thermometer.      What then becomes of this additional vapour?
Or   why  does it not further raise the mercury of the barometer?
   About ten o'clock in the morning the barometer ceases to
rise, and shortly afterwards begins to fall, and it continues
falling until four in the afternoon, although the cooling of the
wet-bulb thermometer by evaporation shows that from ten
until one or two o'clock, the time of the highest temperature,
vapour must be passing into the atmosphere in increasing
quantities 1 and the vapour must be presumed to accumulate
in the atmosphere until four o'clock, as the evaporation gene
rally continues active up to that hour, and no decline of the
dew-point indicates the condensation of any portion of the
vapour thus produced.        Now if increase of vapour had raised
the barometer     up  to ten o'clock, why should not a further
accumulation of vapour after that hour raise the barometer
still higher? The fall of the barometer after ten o'clock, it is
evident, cannot be accounted for from the operation of the
causes named.

   That mere alterations of thermometric temperature and of
vapour pressure, either jointly or separately, do not produce
the fall of the barometer from ten in the morning to four in
the afternoon, may be proved by facts when the registration
of the wet-bulb thermometer is given; but unfortunately this
is seldom done. In the Plymouth report by Mr. S. Harris
that registration is to be found; and there it may be seen that
the temperature theory does not harmonize with the facts.
But in the account of the meteorology of Bombay, as given
by Colonel Sabine, there is no notice of that instrument. Va
pour pressure, as ascertained by the dew-point, is there ex
hibited as one of the two causes which determine barometric
fluctuation,-thermometric temperature being considered the
other; and these two causes are by him represented as suffi
cient to account for the facts and form the basis of his theory,
which for convenient reference I have called “the temperature
 theory.”
    In remarking at present on the Bombay report, I propose
 to confine myself principally to objections to the theory ad
vanced to account for the phaenomena, and do not intend to
 show in a detailed form what were the real causes in operation,
 seeing that           all
                    the facts required are not furnished.     Had                                    an
 account   of  the evaporation that took place been given, would                        I

 470     Mr. T. Hopkins      on the Meteorology of Bombay.
    This   table commences at four o'clock in the morning, that
 hour   being   generally one of the turning-points in the semi
 diurnal movements of the barometer.        From four to ten that
 instrument rises from 29.778 to 29.852 inches. Now this
 rise, on the temperature theory, must be considered to have
 been produced either by a reduction of temperature, as mea
 sured by the thermometer near the surface of the earth, or by
an increase of the pressure of aqueous vapour, as ascertained
by the dew-point; or by both those influences acting together,
and producing the rise of the barometer, as a general result.
    We find, however, that during the first two hours, that is
from four to six o'clock, the thermometer fell from 78°-9 to
78°4, being a fall of 5; and the tendency of this fall most
undoubtedly was to produce a rise of the barometer; but at
the same time the pressure of vapour, as indicated by the
dew-point, declined so much as from 761 to 750, or '011.
Now this comparatively large reduction of vapour pressure is
evidently the greater of the two disturbing forces, and the re
sult of the action of both the forces, according to the theory,
ought to be a fall of the barometer. But instead of falling the
barometer rose during the two hours from 29.778 to 29.805,
or '027; showing that the movement of that instrument in
this time was the reverse of what would have occurred if the
temperature theory was true.
    From six to ten o'clock, the remainder of the first period of
six hours, the barometer continued rising, and passed from
29.805 to 29.852, making a rise in these four hours of -047,
whilst the thermometer rose from 78°4 to 81°8, or 3°4, and
the dew-point increased from 750 to '771, or '021. Thus of
the whole six hours we find that, during the first two,
a fall of temperature of . . ‘5        <U+017F>produced a rise of
                                                             .027
and a fall of the dew-point of -011 U the barometer of
which would appear to prove, and as far as the facts given go,
do prove, that the small fall of temperature had the greater
influence on atmospheric pressure, as the barometer rose 027
while both influences were in operation.
    But in the following four hours, from six to ten o'clock, a
rise of the thermometer of 3°4 and a rise of the dew-point of
•021, were accompanied by a rise of the barometer of '047; or
put into tabular form, say that
    a rise of temperature of 3°4       produced a rise of
                                                             •047

        Mr. T. Hopkins                     on the Meteorology             of       Bombay,              471
ture increases greatly, as much as nearly seven times the
amount that it previously fell, whilst the dew-point, although
it also rises, does not rise to quite double the extent that it
fell in the two hours; yet notwithstanding these great altera
tions, amounting to complete reversals of the two influences
that are in operation, the barometer continues to rise, and
attains an increase of '047.               These facts, however, taken
together, show that temperature, as measured by the therino
meter near the surface of the earth, produces little comparative
effect on the amount of atmospheric pressure; and that the
alteration of vapour pressure must have had much greater                                                    in
fluence than alteration of temperature as measured by the
thermometer, and must have produced the rise of the baro
 meter from six to ten o'clock.
    Proceeding to the next six-hour stage of the daily fluctua
 tions of the barometer, we find that from ten to two o'clock,
 the first four of these six hours, temperature advances 2°3,
 and reaches           its
                        highest point for the day             the last-named  at

  conclusively, that the fluctuations of the barometer in the
  times named were not produced by alterations of temperature
  and of vapour pressure, as they are exhibited to us by the
  thermometer and the dew-point.
      It should be borne in mind, that it is the fall of the baro
  meter from ten in the morning to four in the afternoon while
  evaporation, as shown by the wet-bulb thermometer, is active,
  for which we have particularly to account. Temperature
  rises while vapour augments up to ten o'clock in the morning,
 and at the same time the barometer rises; but after ten, though
 the same two causes continue in operation, yet the barometer
 falls, and continues falling until four in the afternoon.           Now
 why should the same causes be supposed to produce one effect
 up to ten o'clock, and another, of an opposite character, for
 six hours after that time? This is the question that has to be
 answered. The temperature theory, so far from accounting
 for the occurrence of these phaenomena, is directly opposed to
 them, and utterly fails to account for the fall of the barometer
 from ten to four o'clock.
     The alterations which took place in the subsequent twelve
 hours present additional evidence of the inadequacy of the
 temperature theory to account for the semi-diurnal fluctuations
 of the barometer; but as they are not equally palpable with
 those already examined, it is unnecessary to go into a consi
deration of them.

wards shows from other           accounts,    that there is a very small
morning maximum in the locality named, which occurs between
the hours of eight and eleven A.M. This he attributes to the
pressure of additional aqueous vapour, and he seems to think
such a fact confirmatory of the correctness of his views.                                                      If
however an increase of vapour up to eleven o'clock could
raise the barometer, why should not that instrument rise fur
ther after that hour? Had we a registration of the wet and
dry-bulb thermometers and of the dew-point, it is to be pre
sumed that proof would be furnished that evaporation was
more active after eleven than it had been before that hour,
and that there was no decline of the dew-point until a much
later period of the day.          The vapour that must be presumed
to have passed into the atmosphere in the hottest part of the
day, must either have added to the previous pressure on the
barometer and raised                            it,

readily soluble in alcohol, which on evaporation yields palmic
acid of a yellow colour and still very impure.    It is purified
by repeated crystallizations and pressure, and when quite
pure has a melting-point between il3° to 114°F. There re
mains in the alcohol an uncrystallizable yellow oil, which be
comes red on being saponified with caustic potash.
   Palmic acid, procured as described, is readily soluble in al
cohol, from which it crystallizes, the crystals generally being
grouped together into clumps.      From a fused state it solidi
fies into stars, consisting of small crystals radiating from a
centre. The acid was burned with oxide of copper, and gave
the following results:—
   I. 0.074 grim. gave 0-2005 grm. carbonic acid, and 0.079

   In order to determine the atomic weight of the acid, the
silver salt was prepared in the following manner:—The pure
acid was boiled with a strong solution of pure carbonate of
potash, which it readily decomposes: on cooling, the soap se
parated and was removed; it was then dried and dissolved in
alcohol; the solution of soap, after being separated from the
carbonate of potash, was filtered and evaporated to dryness in
a water-bath; it was then dissolved in warm water and pre
cipitated by an excess of nitrate of silver, the precipitate being
washed in the dark.
   Thus prepared, palmate of silver is a light white powder,
insoluble in alcohol and aether, but readily soluble in ammonia.
The following determinations of the amount of silver give the
data for estimating the atomic weight.
      I. 0.994 grm. salt left on ignition 0.271 silver.
    II.  0.315 grm. salt left 0.0855 grim. silver.

     This agrees closely with the numbers found in the analysis
of the acid, showing that it is anhydrous, and possesses the
formula Csa Hsa Os.
     I  remarked that the acid obtained by saponifying palmine
 had a melting-point which never exceeded 112°, while the
 acid prepared directly by crystallizing the solidified fatty acids
 without saponification possessed a melting-point 2° higher.
 To ascertain whether any change took place upon saponifica
 tion, a portion of pure palmic acid, procured as formerly de
 scribed, was saponified by potash, liberated by hydrochloric
 acid, crystallized out of alcohol and analysed.            Its melting
 point was 111°5 F.
     I. O-1575 grim. acid gave 0.414 carbonic acid, and 0.1635
 Water.
      II. 0-166 grm. substance gave 0.4345 carbonic acid, and
 O'171 water.

   The silver salt is therefore of the same composition as that
made from the acid analysed before saponification. The only
alteration is in the assumption of an atom of water during the
separation from the soap, as will be seen from the following
theoretical composition:—
                                                                In   100 Parts.

 the aether solidifies into a crystalline mass which is easily
 removed. It fuses at 61°F., and is very soluble in hot alco

    Many experiments have been made for the purpose of sepa
rating and investigating the volatile substance contained in
the “Woodruff,” to which the ‘Maiwein’ owed                    agreeable             its
odour and flavour.
    Many years ago Voget occupied himself with this sub
                                          +
ject, and obtained from the “Woodruff”                 crystalline sub    a
 stance, which       he
                      described      possessing the same odour
                                                 as                                                        as
 the Tonka bean and Melilotus, and which his experiments
 proved   to   be
                benzoic acid.
     More lately Kosmann          has published some experiments,
                                     f
 which led him         the conclusion that the principle contained
                         to
in   this plant was cumarine, the stearoptine             Tonka beans.        of
 By treating the dried plant with alcohol and aether, driving
 off these solvents and boiling the syrupy residue                 water,                     in
 and evaporating,         he
                         obtained     crystalline mass, whose agree
                                                     a
 able odour and piquant taste were exactly similar             cumarine                  to
 prepared from the Tonka beans.
     The experiments           Kosmann were however purely qua

 litative.   No analysis was made          the crystals obtained from

 dark greenish-brown solution in a water-bath, and the dark
brown residue evaporated to the consistency of syrup. The
distilled alcohol had an aromatic odour, and from the last
more watery portion small crystalline plates were gradually
 deposited.
   The syrup, boiled with water, and the brown solution se
parated by filtration from the insoluble matters, consisting of
 chlorophylle, &c., were agitated with aether. On distilling off
the aether there remained a yellow substance, possessing the
appearance and odour of honey, from which, after some time,
a considerable quantity of yellow crystalline needles sepa
rated, which on heating with water to 50° C. collected at the
bottom of the vessel into a melted mass, and were dissolved
on raising the temperature to the boiling-point. From this
solution, which on cooling became milky, crystals of an inch
in length were gradually deposited, which were purified by
repeated crystallizations.       After being thrice recrystallized
the crystals were of a pure white colour, but deposited some
brownish flakes after melting at a gentle heat.        On repeating
the   recrystallizations   a few times     more, the substance re
mained quite unchanged in colour after fusing, and could
now be considered as quite pure and proper for analysis.
   Before proceeding to the analysis I endeavoured to convert
a small portion of the substance into salicylic acid.        A few
crystals were dissolved in strong potassa ley, evaporated till
the yellow colour at first produced had disappeared, and then
heated somewhat stronger.         The solid residue was saturated
with hydrochloric acid and agitated with aether. The aethereal
solution, evaporated to drive off the aether, gave with sesqui
chloride of iron the beautiful violet colour so characteristic
of salicylic acid.

  The results of my analyses approach near enough to those
of Delalande to prove the identity of cumarine and the sub
stance obtained from the Asperula odorata. A comparison
however of the amount of carbon and hydrogen shows, par
ticularly in the former, a sufficient deviation to throw a doubt
on the absolute number of equivalents. The circumstance
likewise of the near agreement, may even of the excess of the
quantity of hydrogen calculated over that obtained in the
mean of Delalande's experiments, whilst in analysis the re
verse is always the case, gave me grounds to doubt the cor
rectness of his formula, and induced me to repeat the inves
tigation of cumarine obtained from the Tonka beans.
         Preparation of Cumarine from Tonka Beans.
   The following appeared to be the best method of preparing
cumarine from the Tonka beans.
   The beans, finely cut or pounded, were digested for some
time with strong alcohol. The syrupy mass remaining after
distilling off the alcohol, becomes on cooling for the most
part a solid magma of crystals of cumarine, which can be
easily purified by treatment with animal charcoal and repeated
crystallizations.   By proceeding in this manner it is more
easy to separate a fatty oil, which is contained in considerable
quantity in the Tonka bean. This body is colourless, and
without any characteristic odour, soluble in aether, insoluble
in alcohol and water, and possesses the property of dissolving
cumarine in considerable quantity.
    The process of treating the beans with aether, or directly
extracting the cumarine by boiling in water, is much inferior,
 as the greater part of the      oil
                                  also removed with
                                       is                        it,

 afterwards   only  beseparated   with  difficulty.         In
                                                           the fresh
bean the cumarine appears         to    be
                                    contained        in

                                                 the form       pure
 white crystals, and      found collected particularly between

     On repeating the experiments of Delalande                 I arrived at
the following results.
    Cumarine dissolves readily in potassa and forms with it a
yellowish solution, from which acids precipitate cumarine
again unchanged.          It is only attacked by heating with con
centrated    ley, to which pieces of solid caustic potassa have
been added.       From this solution hydrochloric acid precipi
tates a substance totally differing in                       its
                                                    character from cuma

  Formation      of Cumaric and Salicylic Acid from Cumarine.
   From the above experiments it is evident that the formula
given by Delalande to cumaric acid must be regarded as the
correct one. The representation however of the formation of
this acid, to which this chemist was led by the incorrect for
mula of cumarine, requires correction.                       The formation of
cumaric acid      depends      upon     no   decomposition          of water, the
oxygen of which is added to the elements of cumarine, but
simply on the assumption of 2 equivalents of this body, ex
actly analogous to the formation of benzilic acid from benzile,
or isatinic acid from isatine.

   It is not requisite even to fuse the cumarine with caustic
potash : by the employment of an alcoholic solution of po
tassa it is also transformed, though very slowly, into cumaric

 acid. There however in this latter case always remains, even
 after long treatment, a large portion of cumarine undecom
 posed.
    The evolution of hydrogen mentioned by Delalande, and
                                  I
 which, as already stated, never observed in a well-conducted
 experiment, arose evidently from the formation of salicylic
 acid by the further action of the potassa on the cumaric acid.
 This view is supported by the violet-coloured reaction of ses
 quichloride of iron described by him, and which, as I have
 shown, does not belong to cumaric acid.                  His cumaric acid
 evidently contained a small quantity of salicylic acid.
    From the aforesaid grounds, the view taken by Delalande
 on the transformation of cumaric into salicylic acid must also
 be modified.      According to him, no evolution of hydrogen
takes place in this formation, but an aromatic gas is disen
gaged burning with a coloured flame, and which he regarded
as a carbo-hydrogen C, H2, representing the difference of
 constitution between the two acids—

           HO, Cls H, O,            C, H, = HO, Cia H.         O.
        Hydrated cumaric acid. Aromatic gas. Hydrated salicylic acid.
    This manner of viewing the reaction is evidently incorrect.
 If pure  cumarine is fused with hydrate of potassa, the latter
is almost entirely transformed into carbonate after the forma
tion of the salicylic acid. The carbon therefore separates in
the form of an oxygenated compound.
    I have made no quantitative experiment on this point; but
all my observations tend to prove that the formation of the
salicylic acid may be represented by the following equations:—

                                          Salicylic acid.
    As to the aromatic gas burning with a brilliant flame, which
is evolved in the latter stages, it is no carbo-hydrogen, but
the oxide of a carbo-hydrogen, viz. hydrate of phenyle, arising
from the further loss of carbonic acid from the salicylic acid
already formed,—

   Delalande has studied the action           of nitric acid on cuma
rine.   The correction of the formula of the latter body made
it desirable to repeat this experiment also,           as  it was probable

                  M. H.   Bleibtreu on Cumarine.                  489
that a corresponding change would likewise require to be
made in that of the product of decomposition.
    Cumarine dissolves without almost any evolution of red
fumes in cold fuming nitric acid, and with considerable ele
vation of temperature.      On addition of water a white cheesy
precipitate is obtained, which quickly settles to the bottom.
The fluid possesses a deep yellow colour. After washing
with cold water, the precipitate was dissolved in boiling          al
cohol, from which, on cooling, white shining silky crystals
separated. In this treatment with nitric acid a strong heat
is to be particularly avoided, as the whole of the cumarine is
converted into nitropicric acid if the fluid is allowed to boil.
The formation of a small quantity of the latter acid can never
be completely avoided, and from this cause arises the yellow
colour of the mother-liquor.
   To the above product of decomposition Delalande gave the
name nitrocumarine, and the following formula derived from
his view of the composition of cumarine         :-

     I have   but little to add to Delalande's description of the
  properties of this body.     Nitrocumarine dissolves with diffi
  culty in water, alcohol and aether, and crystallizes in fine
  needles from these solvents as soon as the temperature falls
  a little below their boiling-point. Its point of fusion is about
  170° C.; heated beyond this it sublimes without decompo
  sition in the form of large white crystals of the lustre of
  mother-of-pearl.
     Nitrocumarine forms with alkalies a solution of a deep
  yellow, almost red colour, which disappears on the addition
  of an acid, with separation at the same time of a white cry
  stalline matter. This reaction was further examined in the
  hopes of obtaining an acid corresponding to nitrocumarine,
  viz. the nitrocumaric acid.                                      -
     For this purpose nitrocumarine was boiled for some time

  formed, decomposed by hydrochloric acid, and the precipitate
  after removal by washing of the chloride of potassium, re
  crystallized from boiling alcohol.
     To free the crystals (which I regarded as nitrocumaric acid)
  from any nitrocumarine which might still be mixed with
  them, they were dissolved in ammonia, and on boiling, to re
  move any excess of the latter, a portion of the substance was
  deposited in the form of white crystalline flakes. That these
  crystals were only cumarine was proved by the absence of
  any trace of ammonia on heating with potassa.
     The filtered solution, which was neutral, gave with nitrate
  of silver a beautiful orange-yellow colour, with acetate of
  lead an orange precipitate. Both compounds were soluble in
  a considerable quantity of water, forming a lightish yellow
  solution, but less so in alcohol and aether; so that they could
  be purified by boiling in these menstrua.          I have analysed
  these compounds as well as the substance separated from
  them by acids.
     The lead and silver precipitates are direct compounds of
  nitrocumarine with the oxides of the metals, and the electro
  negative bodies obtained from them is pure nitrocumarine.

decide whether nitrocumaric acid can be obtained by careful
fusion with caustic alkalies, or directly from cumaric acid,
by proper treatment with nitric acid.
   The formation of this acid would have been of some inter
est. The late investigations of Zinin have shown us that
acids of this class, under the influence of reducing agents, as
hydrosulphuric acid, &c., exchange 4 equivalents of oxygen
for 2 of hydrogen, or, to express it otherwise,   equivalent of             l
hyponitric acid for 1 of amidogen.
   Whilst bases are thus formed from nitro-carbohydrogens,
the electro-negative character of the nitro-acids remains un
changed. Benzoic acid, for example, treated in the above
manner, gives the following series:–

converted into the desired acid. For this purpose quantity                           a

niacal gas was passed till the whole was dissolved, and then

   The fluid, from which, even after several days, no sulphur
 separated,was distilled in a retort till no more sulphide of
 ammonia  passed  over. On exposure to the air in a flat vessel
it now deposited                   a yellow, slimy,    tenacious mass, the cha
racteristic garlic smell of                    which led to the suspicion of                             its

to be distinguished from cumarine. On fusing these crystals
with hydrate of potassa and testing the product of decompo
sition with sesquichloride of iron, the intense violet colour
produced by the salicylic acid which had been formed showed
with certainty the presence of cumarine in the original sub
stance.
   The hippuric acid found in the urine of graminivorous
animals has in various ways been supposed to be derived from
the benzoic acid imagined to exist in the Anthoacanthum odo
ratum. The transformation experienced by that acid in the
animal oeconomy appeared in the highest degree to give sup
port to this view.
    It
     would be desirable to try if the same change takes place
with cumarine.  The narcotic action of this substance on the
animal organism however prevented the making of any direct
experiments.
LXIX.      On the Integration and Transformation of certain
    Differential Equations. By the Rev. BRIce BRoNwiN.*
I HAVE        lately discovered a very simple method of integra
      ting and transforming certain differential equations, which
I believe to be quite new. A similar method may be applied
to the solution of equations in finite differences.   Brief illus
trations of it have been transmitted to the Mathematician and
the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, but not yet published.
The present paper contains an extension of the method as
applied to differential equations. The following subsidiary
formulae will be required to facilitate the reductions.    And it
must be observed that                 D always     stands       for   #, and operates
upon the whole of the quantity which follows                              it.

          DEAR SIR,
       every one appears to be more or less engaged                                        in the
SINCE
  manufacture of the so-called “gun-cotton,” it may                                        be   in
teresting to some of your readers to know that it is capable of
being applied to a purpose different from any hitherto de
scribed, viz. that of insulating an electrically charged body.
I  was yesterday engaged in unravelling some cotton which
had matted together while in the acid, when was struck with              I
the tenacity with which it adhered to my fingers; and on
lightly holding a small flock of      and approachingit,   finger                   a           of
the other hand,       any foreign body, found that was strongly
                            or                                               it
attracted towards       thus differing essentially from the unpre

                                                      a          the                       to

venient form for testing                  its
                                insulating power, and suspended
from     brass rod two equally charged copper balls, one with
          a
white silk and the other with the prepared cotton. By ex

than the other; thus proving the cotton to be a more perfect
insulator than the silk, which has hitherto been chosen as best
adapted for the purpose of insulation.             -
   The acid employed was a mixture of equal parts of nitric
acid, sp. gr. 1:46, and sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1.83, and the
cotton was immersed for about five minutes. It was not
highly explosive, detonated only partially when struck with a
hammer, and required to be heated considerably to cause it
to explode *.

502     Dr. Redtenbacher               on a Class       of Organic Acids.
mode of origin has been made known by Pelouze, namely the
production of butyric acid by the decomposition of the hy
drate of carbon, of decayed cheese, and of similar bodies; and
the production of butyric acid has been detected by Marchand
in sour-krout and in cucumber-water; and also by Wurz in
tainted meat.
   Iljenko and Laskowsky, in Liebig’s laboratory, have found
a considerable quantity of valerianic acid in half-decayed
cheese. Cheese which consists of the ingredients of the milk
contains only fat and caseine; the valerianic acid could only be
formed out of these two ingredients.        Fresh butter contains
no valerianic acid; Liebig has however obtained by the action
of caustic alkali on cheese valerianic and butyric acid. But
these last two modes cannot be the ordinary way in which
these acids exist in organic bodies. It is not especially to be
referred to putrefaction or to cheese.
   It is probable that nature follows a more general course in
producing so great a variety of the easily volatile fatty acids.
They are combined with the base oxide of lipyle, the constant
companion of        all

oxidizable products arising from the action of nitric acid
upon oleic acid, but not with the view of repeating or con
trolling the experiments of Laurent and Bromeis: I have not
occupied myself with the products which these two chemists
have obtained, but only examined the volatile substances
given off on oxidation by the action of nitric acid;                 have               I
discovered the before-mentioned series of acids volatile under
300° Centigrade.       The oleic acid which served for my expe
riments was obtained from the stearine factory of this place;
it is exclusively obtained from the fat of oxen. It contained
some tallow and margaric acid, which did not essentially                                          in
terfere with the following experiments.            When pure stearine
is acted upon by soda, and the solution very much concen
trated, the decomposition, which is subsequently effected by
an acid, gives off the smell of butyric acid; the separated
oleic acid melts under 70° C., so that there remains no doubt
that even the fixed acids by oxidation give off acids volatile
at 300° C., (CH), O4.
    I made use of a very spacious tubulated retort to effect the
oxidation of about 10 gallons contents, the neck of which
was furnished with a cooling apparatus. 5 lbs. of the strong
est brown fuming acid were poured in, and a funnel provided,
whose lower opening dipped into the nitric acid. The acid
was slightly warmed, and the oil carefully introduced in small
portions at a time. Upon each addition of                               oil

tained  all  the acids, from the valerianic           the capric.  toThe

504        Dr. Redtenbacher on a Class of Organic Acids.
 solution of the easily soluble acids was neutralized by car
 bonate of soda and evaporated to a syrup.              Acetate of soda
 first crystallized out. The mother-liquor was decomposed by
 sulphuric acid, the floating oily stratum drawn off, and the
acetic, metacetonic and butyric acids were partly separated
from one another by their boiling-points; the acetic acid and
the metacetonic were determined by a silver salt, and the bu
tyric acid by a barytic salt. It may be conceived that the
separation of these nine acids, possessing such similar pro
perties, was effected with much difficulty. It is already trou
blesome to separate the four volatile acids of butter by means
of the crystallization of the barytic salts; nearly one-third of
the barytic salts remain as an inseparable mixture.             The vo
latile acids of butter differ in the amount of the factor n,
but not more than 4, while the series with which I was oc
cupied differed only 2. The similarity of the properties of
the barytic salt, or, what is the same thing, the difficulty of
their separation, was therefore twice as great,           I   had there
fore a  large  quantity  of the mixed   barytic   salts which was unfit
for examination; it would have been impossible to exhibit
separately all the acids unless      I   had had 4 oz. of the mixed
volatile acids.
    Before I made use of the barytic salts I tried the separa
tion of the hydrated acids by means of their boiling-point.
According to recent experiments of Kopp and Fehling, it ap
pears that the hydrated acids (CHA) O, increase in their boil
ing-point about 20°C. when the factor n is augmented by 2.
But when I undertook the distillation, the thermometer rose
so regularly from degree to degree that I soon discovered the
futility of this mode of separation. A portion 9f the acid hy
drates which came over at the boiling-points of butyric acid,
164° C. and about 4° lower, were converted into silver salts;
they proved to be upon examination a mixture of three acids,
—the butyric acid, the next lower, the metacetonic, and the
next higher, the valerianic acid. Therefore, as a complete
separation could not be effected by distillation of the hydrated
acids, I   did not attempt the separation by means of the ethyle
compounds, which would in         all  probability have acted   in   the
Same manner.
    For the less volatile acids, from valerianic     to    capric acids,
I   had recourse   to   the barytic   salts.    By  gentle   evaporation
and    crystallization
                     I     obtained a   seriesof    about   twenty  cry
stallizations, and     by  means  of     anexamination according     to
their known atomic weights,     I     was enabled  to    refer the sepa
rate  crystallizations   totheir different   acids, and by subsequent
recrystallization   of   the different   portions  to    separate them

        I
      had originally intended only to undertake the examina
tion of the volatile acids of butter, but the form of the barytic
salts led me to the expectation and to the discovery of the
intervening acids. If the crystallization of the four volatile
acids of butter be compared, it is found that they               crystal                         all

proate of baryta and the foregoing fine granular crystals of
caprylate of baryta, there appeared crystals in large plates,
with a mother-of-pearl lustre, which recrystallized several
times in the same form. It appeared from analogy that it
could only contain an acid whose composition was between
the caproic and caprylic acids, or it rather was presumed to
be with certainty the oenanthylic acid discovered by Tilley.
The quantity of the salt obtained was very small, only a few
grammes, nevertheless it was necessary to recrystallize it in
order to take only the middle portions. I obtained only about
400 milligrammes of the pure salt for examination, of which
a part was used for qualitative analysis. The properties how
ever agreed in every respect with the oenanthylate of baryta
of Tilley. There remained only sufficient for the determina

latile  body, which is also obtained        by  the oxidation of the
oily acids, and which appears as a middle member that first
originates from oily acids and then changes, on the one hand,
into suberic and pimelic acids, and, on the other, by the
presence of water into the volatile fatty acids.            the oxida     If
tion is not carried so far that the last trace of the fatty stra
tum in the retort does not disappear, there floats on the sur
face of the water on cooling an oily stratum of an unguent
consistency, which, after washing with water, possesses a
strong odour of sweat.        This unctuous body is heavier than
water, easily soluble in alcohol and aether, but not capable of
being distilled over.                If
                              heated to above 100°C., a kind of
combustion takes place of           elements, giving out

512   Prof. G. B. Airy on the History of the Discovery of
suggested   by a theory, which, fruitful as it has been, we may
almost venture to call fanciful.       Astraea was found, in the
course of a well-conducted re-examination of the heavens, ap
parently contemplating the discovery of a new planet as only
one of many possible results. But the motions of Uranus,
examined by philosophers who were fully impressed with the
universality of the law of gravitation, have long exhibited the
effects of some disturbing body: mathematicians have at length
ventured on the task of ascertaining where such a body could
be; they have pointed out that the supposition of a disturbing
body moving in a certain orbit, precisely indicated by them,
would entirely explain the observed disturbances of Uranus:
they have expressed their conviction, with a firmness which         I
must characterise as wonderful, that the disturbing planet
would be found exactly in a certain spot, and presenting ex
actly a certain appearance; and in that spot, and with that
appearance, the planet has been found.        Nothing in the whole
history of astronomy can be compared with this.
    The principal steps in the theoretical investigations have
been made by one individual, and the published discovery of
the planet was necessarily made by one individual.        To these
persons the public attention has been principally directed;
and well do they deserve the honours which they have received,
and which they will continue to receive.        Yet we should do
wrong if we considered that these two persons alone are to be
regarded as the authors of the discovery of this planet.     I am
confident that it will be found that the discovery is a conse
quence of what may properly be called a movement of the
age; that it has been urged by the feeling of the scientific
world in general, and has been nearly perfected by the colla
teral, but independent labours, of various persons possessing
 the talents or powers best suited to the different parts of the
 researches.
    With this conviction, it has appeared to me very desirable
 that the authentic history of this discovery should be published
 as soon as possible; not only because it will prove a valuable
 contribution to the history of science, but also because it may
 tend to do justice to some persons, who otherwise would not
 receive in future times the credit which they deserve.       And
 as a portion of the history,   Iventure to offer to this Society
a statement of the circumstances which have come to my own
knowledge.     I have thought that I could with propriety do
this, not because I can pretend to know     all
                                             the history     of

                   the Planet earterior to Uranus.              513
age,   I have not directly   contributed either to the theoretical
or to the observing parts of the discovery. In a matter of
this delicacy I have thought it best to act on my own judge
ment, without consulting any other person; I have, however,
solicited the permission of my English correspondents for the
publication of letters.
    Without pretending to fix upon a time when the conviction
of the irreconcilability of the motions of Uranus with the law
of gravitation first fixed itself in the minds of some individuals,
we may without hesitation date the general belief in this irre
concilability from the publication of M. Alexis Bouvard’s
Tables of Uranus in 1821.         It was fully shown in the intro
duction to the tables, that when every correction for pertur
bation indicated by the best existing theories was applied, it
was still impossible to reconcile the observations of Flamsteed,
Lemonnier, Bradley and Mayer, with the orbit required by
 the observations made after 1781, and the elements of the
 orbit were adopted from the latter observations, leaving the
 discordances with the former (amounting sometimes to three
 minutes of arc) for future explanation.
    The orbit thus adopted represented pretty well the obser
 vations made in the years immediately following the publica
 tion of the tables.    But in five or six years the discordance
 again growing up became so great that it could not escape no
 tice. A small error was shown by the Kremsmünster Obser
 vations of 1825 and 1826: but perhaps          I am not in error in
 stating that the discordance was first prominently exhibited
 in the Cambridge Observations, the publication of which from
  1828 was conducted under my superintendence.
     While still residing at Cambridge,     I received from the Rev.
     J.
 T. Hussey (now Dr. Hussey) a letter, of which the follow
 ing is an extract. It will be considered, I think, as honour
 able to that gentleman's acuteness and zeal.         I must premise
 that the writer had lately passed through Paris.

     “With M. Alexis Bouvard had some conversation upon
  a subject  I had often meditated, which will probably interest
 you, and your opinion may determine mine. Having taken
         pains last year with some observations of Uranus, I was
  #.
   ed to examine closely Bouvard's tables of that planet.       The
  apparently inexplicable discrepancies between the ancient and

 514    Prof. G. B. Airy on the History of the Discovery of
 modern observations suggested to me the possibility of some
 disturbing body beyond Uranus, not taken into account be
 cause unknown.       My first idea was to ascertain some approxi
 mate   place   of this supposed body empirically, and then with
 my large reflector set to work to examine all the minute stars
 thereabouts: but I found myself totally inadequate to the
 former part of the task.                     If
                                    I could have done it formerly, it
 was   beyond    me  now,   even  supposing      I had the time, which
 was not the case.       I therefore   relinquished     the matter alto
 gether, but subsequently, in conversation with Bouvard,                                                I
 inquired if the above might not be the case: his answer was
 that, as might have been expected, it had occurred to him,
 and some correspondence had taken place between Hansen
 and himself respecting             Hansen's opinion was, that one
                                          it.
 disturbing body would not satisfy the phaenomena, but that                                             he
 conjectured there were two planets beyond Uranus. Upon
 my speaking            of
                     obtaining the places empirically, and then
 sweeping closely for the bodies,          fully acquiesced

I am certain, be received as creditable to the intelligence and

fonctions, je m'occupe d'un travail que je crois n'être pas sans
importance.     Mon oncle [M. Alexis Bouvard] travaille à ré
faire ses tables de Jupiter et de Saturne, en se servant des
corrections apportées recemment aux élémens astronomiques.
Il m'a cedé les tables d'Uranus a réconstruire. En consultant
les comparaisons que vous avez fait des observations de cette

I am engaged upon a general reduction of the observations of
planets made at Greenwich, from the commencement of Brad
ley's observations to the present time. It may perhaps be a
year before I can furnish you with the places deduced from
these observations.     *                  *
                                * With respect to the errors of
the tables of  Uranus,    I think you will find that it is the lon
gitude which is most defective, and that the errors in latitude
are not at present increasing.       To show this, I set down a
few of  my  results.   * * * You will see by this statement
that the errors of    longitude   are increasing with fearful ra
pidity, while those of latitude are nearly stationary. * * *
I  cannot conjecture what is the cause of these errors, but                                         I
 am inclined, in the first instance, to ascribe them to some
 error in the perturbations.      There is no error in the pure
elliptic theory (as I found by examination some time ago).
If  it be the effect of any unseen body, it will be nearly im
 possible ever to find out      place.”     its

sake of keeping in connexion the papers which relate to the

of the last letter quoted, I had received the first intimation of
these calculations which have led to a distinct indication of
the place where the disturbing planet ought to be sought.
The date of the following letter is Feb. 18, 1844:—

   “A young friend of mine, Mr. Adams, of St. John's College,
is working at the theory of Uranus, and is desirous of obtain

when near opposition in the years 1818–26, with the factors
for reducing them to errors of heliocentric longitude.    Are
your reductions of the planetary observations so far advanced
that you could furnish these data ? and is the request one
which you have any objection to comply with ? If Mr. Adams
may be favoured in this respect, he is further desirous of
knowing, whether in the calculation of the tabular errors any
alterations have been made in Bouvard's Tables of Uranus
besides that         of Jupiter's mass.”

planet, and has arrived at results which he would be glad to
communicate to you personally, if you could spare him a few
moments of your valuable time. His calculations are founded
on the observations you were so good as to furnish him with
some time ago; and from his character as a mathematician,
and his practice in calculation, I should consider the deduc

   On the day on which this letter was dated, I was present at
a meeting of the French Institute.                       I
                                       acknowledged it by the

you mention to Mr. Adams that I am very much interested
with the subject of his investigations, and that I should be de

   On one of the last days of October, 1845, Mr. Adams
called at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, in my absence,
left the following important paper:—

522     Prof. G. B. Airy on the History of the Discovery of
Uranus.       This error is now very considerable,         as you will be
able to ascertain by comparing the normal equations, given in
the Greenwich observations for each year, for the times before
opposition with the times after opposition.”
    I have   before stated, that I considered the establishment of
this error of the radius vector of Uranus to be a very import
ant determination.      I therefore considered that the trial, whe
ther the error of radius vector would be explained by the same
theory which explained the error of longitude, would be truly
an experimentum crucis.        And I waited with much anxiety for
Mr. Adams's answer to        my   query. Had it been in the affirma
tive,  I should at once have exerted all the influence which             I
might possess, either directly or indirectly, through my friend
Professor Challis, to procure the publication of Mr. Adams's
theory”.
    From some cause with which I am unacquainted, probably
an accidental one, I received no immediate answer to this              in
quiry.     I  regret this deeply, for many reasons.
    While I was expecting more complete information on Mr.
Adams's theory, the results of a new and most important                in
vestigation reached me from another quarter. In the Comptes
Rendus of the French Academy for the 10th of November,
 1845, which arrived in this country in December, there is a
paper by M. Le Verrier on the perturbations of Uranus pro
duced by Jupiter and Saturn, and on the errors in the ellip
tic elements of Uranus, consequent on the use of erroneous
perturbations in the treatment of the observations.             It is im
possible for me here to enter into details as to the conclusions
of this valuable memoir: I shall only say that, while the cor
rectness of the former theories, as far as they went, was gene
rally established, many small terms were added; that the ac
 curacy of the calculations was established by duplicate inves
tigations, following different courses, and executed with ex
 traordinary labour; that the corrections to the elements, pro
 duced by treating the former observations with these corrected
 perturbations, were obtained; and that the correction to the
 ephemeris for the present time, produced by the introduction
of the new perturbations and the new elements, was investi
gated, and found to be incapable of explaining the observed
 irregularity of Uranus.         Perhaps it may be truly said that
 the  theory   of Uranus was now, for the first time, placed on a
 satisfactory foundation. This important labour, as M. Le Ver
 rier states, was undertaken at the urgent request of M. Arago.
    In the Comptes Rendus for June 1, 1846, M. Le Verrier gave
 .*   Here the Astronomer Royal explained to the meeting, by means of -a
diagram, the nature of the errors of the tabular radius vector.

contains the results of a new reduction of nearly the exist                              all
 ing observations      Uranus, and their treatment with reference
                             of
to   the  theory        of

 memoir.      After concluding from this reduction that the ob
 servations are absolutely irreconcilable with the theory, M. Le
 Verrier considers      the second part
                              in              the possible explana all
 tions  of the discordance, and concludes that none       admissible                     is

assembled at Southampton.       * We see it [the probable new
planet] as Columbus saw America from the shores of Spain.

line of our analysis, with a certainty hardly inferior to that of

suspected planet.

   * º * Il a toujours été dans mon désir de vous en écrire,

que mes recherches fussent complètes, et ainsi moins indignes
de vous être offertes.    Je compte avoir terminé la rectification
des éléments de la planète troublante avant l'opposition qui va
arriver; et parvenir à connaître ainsi les positions du nouvel
astre avec une grande précision.      Si je pouvais espérer que
vous aurez assez de confiance dans mon travail pour chercher
cette planète dans le ciel, je m'empresserais, Monsieur, de vous
envoyer sa position exacte, dès que je l'aurai obtenue.
   * La comparaison des positions d'Uranus, observées dans ces
dernières années, dans les oppositions et dans les quadratures,
montre que le rayon de la planète, calculé par les tables en
usage, est effectivement très-inexact.    Cela n'a pas lieu dans
mon orbite, telle que je l'ai déterminée; il n'y a pas plus
d'erreur dans les quadratures que dans         oppositions. les

Cette circonstance a nécessairement            rendu les éléments de
l'ellipse faux, et c'est à l'erreur de l'excentricité et à l'erreur
de la longitude du périhélie qu'il faut attribuer l'erreur ac
tuelle du rayon vecteur d'Uranus.
    * Il résulte de ma théorie que l'excentricité donnée par M.
Bouvard doit être augmentée , et qu'il en est de même de la
longitude du périhélie ; deux causes qui contribuent, à cause
de la position actuelle de la planète dans son orbite, à aug

this distance to be less than the former value by about sºoth
part of the whole. The result is very satisfactory, and appears
to show that, by still further diminishing the distance, the
agreement between the theory and the later observations may
be rendered complete, and the excentricity reduced at the
same time to a very small quantity. The mass and the ele

the two hypotheses, are as follows:—

in both cases, so that the differences between the two sets of

the fundamental hypothesis. The following table exhibits the
differences between the theory and the observations which
were used as the basis of calculation.         The quantities given

errors given by the observations of 1781, 1782, and 1783, and
those of 1769 and 1771.     The differences between the results
of the two hypotheses are exceedingly small till we come to
the last years of the series, and become sensible precisely at
the point where both sets of results begin to diverge from the
observations; the errors corresponding to the second hypo
thesis being, however, uniformly smaller.     The errors given
by the Greenwich Observations of 1848 are very sensible,
being for the first hypothesis + 6"-84, and for the second
 +5"50. By comparing these errors, it may be inferred that
the agreement of theory and observation would be rendered
very close by assuming        #=0:57, and the corresponding                       mean
longitude on the 1st of October, 1846, would be about 315°
 20', which I am inclined to think is not far from the truth.
It is plain also that the excentricity corresponding to this value
of   #             be very small.      In    consequence           of the divergence
     (l would
of the results of the two hypotheses, still later observations
would be most valuable for correcting the distances, and                                   I
should feel exceedingly obliged if you would kindly commu
nicate to me two normal places near the oppositions of 1844
and 1845.
    “As Flamsteed's first observation of Uranus (in 1690) is a
single one, and the interval between it and the rest is so large,
I  thought it unsafe to employ this observation in forming the
equations of condition.    On comparing it with the theory,                                I
find the difference to be rather large and greater for the se
cond hypothesis than for the first, the errors being +44".5 and
 +50"-0 respectively.         If
                           the error be supposed to change in
proportion to the change of mean distance,          value corre      its
sponding      to   #=0:57, will       be about         +   70", and the         error   in
the time    of transit will   be between          would be de

found that Venus had phases like the Moon, nothing (in my
opinion) so bold, and so justifiably bold, has been uttered in
astronomical prediction.          It is here, if I mistake not, that we
see a character far     superior   to that of the able, or enterprising,
or industrious mathematician; it is here that we see the philo
sopher. The mathematical investigations will doubtless be
published in detail; and they will, as mathematical studies, be
highly instructive: but no details published after the planet's
discovery can ever have for me the charm which I have found
in this abstract which preceded the discovery.
    I understand that M. Le Verrier communicated his prin
cipal conclusions to the astronomers of the Berlin Observatory
on September 23, and that, guided by them, and comparing
their observations with a star-map, they found the planet on
the same evening. And I am warranted by the verbal assu
rances of Professor Challis in stating that, having received the
paper on September 29, he was so much impressed with the
sagacity and clearness of M. Le Verrier's limitations of the
field of observation, that he instantly changed his plan of ob
serving, and noted the planet, as an object having a visible
disc, on the evening of the same day.
     My account, as a documentary history, supported by letters
 written during the events, is properly terminated: but think    I
it advisable, for the sake of clearness, to annex extracts from
a letter which I have received from Professor Challis since
 the beginning of October, when          I returned to England.

effect of a movement of the age.            It is shown, not merely by
the circumstance that different mathematicians have simulta
neously but independently been carrying on the same investi
gations, and that different astronomers, acting without concert,
have at the same time been looking for the planet in the same
part of the heavens; but also by the circumstance that the
minds of these philosophers, and of the persons about them,
had long been influenced by the knowledge of what had been
done by others, and of what had yet been left untried, and
that in      all
              parts     the work the mathematician and the astro
                             of

                                  the exhortations and the sympathy
of   those whose opinions they valued most.                    not consider

             I SHOULD         have preferred deferring the
                  nication which    I
                                                              commu
                                       have now the honour to lay
before you, of the results to which          I  have been led by the
study of the phaenomena accompanying the transfer of par
ticles between metallic points, spheres or plates, by an ener
getic galvanic current.
    “The investigation of the molecular phaenomena, which             I
have undertaken with the aid of the powerful apparatus in the
Teylerian Museum, is still far from being finished; but as I
find in the Comptes Rendus, tome xxii. p. 690, an extract of a
memoir by M. De la Rive on the same phaenomena, and that
its illustrious author there communicates some results which
appear to me not wholly to coincide with what my experi
ments have indicated,       I  think it may be useful for science to
transmit to      you  some of the principal facts at which      I have
arrived, deferring to give them more in detail when             I shall
have finished several other experiments, the apparatus for
which is constructing,
    “The battery, on Grove’s construction, in the Teylerian
Museum, is composed of sixty pairs, the elements of which have
a surface of forty-five English square inches.           I had first an
apparatus made by means of which           I  could produce  the lumi
nous arc at the focus of a microscope.            I moved a metallic
point under the microscope, one while towards a similar point,
then towards a metallic plate. The movement was effected
by means of a screw micrometer, which enabled me to appre
ciate the hundredths of a millimetre,
    “I     could never obtain the transfer of matter without a
previous contact, and in this I am in perfect agreement with
the illustrious Genevese professor.         I  held the two very elon
gated points at a distance from one another, not exceeding
Tºoth of a millimetre, without ten elements of my large pile
being able to produce a commencement of transference. As
soon as contact has taken place the current passes; but like
wise instantly ceases when the points are very much attenuated
 [effilées], because their ends are fused and repelled along the
electrodes, a phaenomenon connected with another, of which
I  shall speak hereafter, and to which I shall return in a sub
sequent memoir,
    “When however         I  employed ten elements of ordinary
dimension, the current continued after the contact; and               I
observed very well under the microscope what passes when
              * From the Comptes Rendus for August 31, 1846.

     On the Luminous Phaenomena of the Voltaic Battery.              539
the two points are withdrawn from one another, or the point
from a plate. The repulsive force being less,              I saw that as
soon as the contact took place the points fused; that the liquid
matter,-the melted metal, followed the receding movement of
the point, and remained adhering to the point and to the plate,
whilstit was pushed from one of the poles to the other, a move
ment which was perceivable enough by means of the micro
scope; at the same time the metal burnt, producing the well
known light of the galvanic arc.
    “This phaenomenon is not that of the transfer of the matter
between two poles placed at a distance from one another,
You may, it is true, by suddenly withdrawing the points, break
the thread of melted metal by which the current is conducted
in this experiment, and the transfer of the matter will then be
made through the air; but it seems to me that there will always
be some difficulty in ascertaining which of the two phaenomena
takes place. It cannot always be decided whether the transport
of the fused matter, forming an uninterrupted thread, takes
place, or if it is effected through the air without the points being
connected by any [continuous liquid?] matter whatever.
    “The phaenomenon which is observed after a previous con
tact seems to me to be of a complex nature, and to lead ne
cessarily to uncertain results.
    “Fortunately I could resort to a contrivance which enabled
me to establish the current with transfer of the particles, when
the electrodes were placed at a sufficient distance from one
another, and without there being the least contact. This con
trivance consists in passing an electric discharge from point to
point, or from a point to a plate arranged previously at the
distance at which the action of the current permits the transfer.
As soon as the electric spark passes, either from the positive
pole to the negative pole, or in the opposite direction, the cur
rent is immediately established, and the transfer of the particles
commences”.
    “After having thus removed a first cause of error, which
 the previous contact seemed to me liable to introduce into the
 results, l observed that there still remained another, namely
 the combustion of the metallic particles, the transfer of which
does not take place without a great development of heat.
    “It  was necessary for me to render this combustion impos
 sible by  making my experiments in vacuo; an apparatus con
 structed for this purpose by one of our most skilful engineers,
 M. Logeman, and which l shall describe in detail when my
 experiments are completed, fully answered my wishes.

   By this similarity of the results as found and calculated, it is
evident that the mercury cannot become oxidized when pure
hydrogen is burnt with an excess of oxygen.    Mercury sub
limed also in this case; but no trace of the crystals spoken
of could be seen, even when the residual gas was dried.

mixture a small portion of atmospheric air (which is calcu
lated to contain in 100 vols. 20.9 vols. of oxygen); I obtained

   According to these experiments, it appears impossible to
determine accurately in the usual way, by combustion with
oxygen, the quantity of a combustible gas when nitrogen is
present, on account of the simultaneous oxidation of the ni
trogen producing from 2 to 3 per cent. more hydrogen, as
shown by the last two experiments, and which under more
unfavourable circumstances is liable to be still increased.
Notwithstanding the dilution with atmospheric air, the eleva
tion of the temperature on combustion was so great, that the
inner surface of the eudiometer was covered with sublimed
mercury, upon which was deposited a number of microscopic
crystals; they made their appearance as soon as the remaining
gas was dried by means of chloride of calcium.
   One of the conditions which in the above case appears to
be absolutely necessary for the formation of mitric acid, is the
great elevation of temperature of the gas during combustion.
The lowering the temperature to a certain point is sufficient
entirely to prevent the oxidation of the nitrogen. This is best
accomplished by diluting the combustible gas with 1, 2 or 3
volumes of atmospheric air, by which means the accuracy of
 the analysis is not in the least affected.      The following ana
 lysis, where hydrogen was deflagrated with twice            volume           its

   Professor Bunsen has been so kind as to communicate to me
the following very interesting series of experiments relating
to this subject, proving clearly that the formation of nitric
acid is diminished in the combustion of explosive mixtures
according to the dilution with atmospheric air.   He mixed a
constant quantity of atmospheric air with a decreasing quan
tity of pure explosive gas formed by decomposing water by
means of electricity, and obtained the following results on
combustion         :-

   By this it is proved that the ignition of combustible gases
containing nitrogen must not be attempted at too far a limit
from the point at which the mixed gases are combustible.

the hills being flat and shapeless, and their sides embossed with small
round protuberances, between which the water stagnates and moss
accumulates.      Most gneiss districts seem but a repetition of these
features on the great scale, the hills being seldom serrated in outline
or broken into rocky cliffs; whilst the valleys or straths are wide and
flat, full of small lakes or pools, and disfigured by brown heaths and
dark morasses.      It has altogether the aspect of a land newly raised
from the ocean, in which the rivers have not had time to hollow out
channels for themselves or to complete its drainage.           In a word, all
who are in quest of the picturesque should avoid the pure gneiss
districts, as the few spots worthy of notice will be found separated
by long, dreary, uninteresting tracts.” (Page 134.)
   Another important substance in the formation of the Highlands is
quartz rock, and our author's description of the features which it
impresses on the scenery is no less felicitous than the preceding.
“The regions where it abounds have a very peculiar aspect, the
hills being in general conoidal, with a smooth flowing outline and
few asperities, though with numerous scattered fragments. The
soil that covers them is remarkable for sterility even in this land of
barrenness; whilst their summits and declivities, refusing nourish
ment to the humblest moss, shine with dazzling whiteness.              Of this
kind is the comical stack Balloch-man-fey, the last remarkable moun
tain on the west coast, whose naked ridge of bright quartz shines in
the sun like snow, and was described by Pennant as marble.”
(Pp. 135, 136.)
   The above extracts may serve as specimens of Mr. Nicol's talent
in describing the general aspect of a country, as resulting from the
nature of its mineral constituents.          It is greatly to his praise that
these   large  and extended views are introduced in connection with
the most minute and accurate descriptions of the rocks themselves.
    The other side of the trough consists principally of transition
rocks, viz. clay-slate and graywacke, corresponding to the older              Si
lurian of Sir Roderick Murchison.          In them fossils are exceedingly
rare, but they contain graptolites (p. 28). They are penetrated not
only by trap rocks, but also by granite and syenite.
    In the work before us, Mr. Nicol, having briefly described the
physical geography of Scotland, proceeds to give an account of the
three great districts which have now been indicated.             Under each
head we have first a general view of the geological constitution of the
 country, and then a descriptive survey of         its
                                                     several localities. The
 author thus introduces    in   their proper places      all

as to be used for fuel, as at Pitfirrane in Fife, and other places; and
it finally passes into coal. (P. 64.)

    According to M. Payen the formula of caffeine is C8H10 N2 03.
A part of the caffeine may be obtained directly, by treating the coffee
first with aether and then with absolute alcohol: by afterwards treat
ing it with alcohol of 0-60 several substances are separated, among
which is a very important crystalline body, containing the remainder
of the caffeine in a state of combination. These crystals are formed
of a double salt, resulting from the combination of an organic acid
(chlorogenic acid) with two bases; one of which is organic, and is
caffeine; the other mineral, is potash.
   This natural salt of coffee is then a double chlorogenate of potash
and caffeine: if it be rubbed after being dried at 212° on a sheet of
paper while hot, it is so electrical as to adhere to the blade of a knife

composed.     The vapour which is disengaged yields, when condensed,
acicular crystals of caffeine: it is scarcely soluble in anhydrous alcohol,
even when heated; but a saturated boiling solution in alcohol of 95 de
grees, yields on cooling prismatic crystals radiating from a common
centre; it is more soluble in alcohol of 85 degrees, and the crystal
lization is more abundant on cooling: the solubility always increases
with the proportion of water: pure water dissolves still more, and
a hot saturated solution becomes a mass on cooling.              A cold solu
tion, when slowly evaporated, gradually deposits a crown of very fine
crystals in mammillated groups. The aqueous solution while crystal
lizing suffers more or less alteration by exposure to the air, and be
comes yellow first, and afterwards greenish-brown.
   The crystals of this double salt, when slightly heated with hydrate
of potash, become of a vermilion or orange-red colour; heated more
strongly, the mixture melts, becomes yellow, yields abundant ammo
niacal vapours, and becomes brown, &c. When this double salt is
heated with concentrated sulphuric acid, an intense violet colour is
produced, and a bronze-coloured pellicle.            Hydrochloric acid pro
duces a similar but less marked     effect; nitric acid produces an orange
yellow colour.
    When acetate of lead is added to the aqueous or alcoholic solution
of the double chlorogenate, a flocculent greenish-yellow precipitate
is formed: the trisacetate yields a pure yellow-coloured precipitate.
Nitrate of silver, alone, produces no effect; but when previously mixed
with a very small quantity of ammonia, it produces a yellow colour
which becomes brown; the liquid becomes turbid, and a pellicle of
reduced metallic silver floats upon                 it,
                                            and gradually extends over the

ON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF RUTHENIUM AND SOME OF
           ITS COMPOUNDS.  BY DR. C. CLAUS.
   Ruthenium occurs in the residues of the Russian and also of the
American platinum ores, but only to the small extent of 1–1; per
cent. It is a constituent of osmium-iridium ; the varieties of this
mineral analysed by me contained, besides osmium and iridium, 3–6
per cent. ruthenium, 10 per cent. platinum, 1%–2 per cent. rhodium,
with traces of copper, iron and palladium. The mineral described
by Herman under the name of irite contains 3 per cent. Ru along
with Rh, Pt, Os, Ir, Fe0, Crº O3, Al2O3, SiO3 and IrO2. The ru
thenium does not occur in that portion of the platinum ore which
is soluble in aqua regia; it was discovered in the platinum residues,
because these always contain osmium-iridium.
   The following is the method which I adopt at present for          pre       its
paration:-Osmium-iridium            powdered

                                      iron removed from the mortar are
extracted with muriatic acid, and the powder mixed with chloride

mium, is thrown down. This, after edulcoration, is heated in a retort
with a sufficient quantity of nitric acid until the acid has passed over,
and the osmium removed as osmic acid. The residue in the retort
is removed, ignited with nitre and caustic potash which is free from
silica, in a silver crucible, for an hour, and the ignited mass softened
and dissolved in cold distilled water. The solution is left to clear
for 2 hours in a corked flask, the perfectly transparent, beautiful
orange-coloured solution removed with a siphon from the insoluble
portion, and the alkaline liquid neutralized with nitric acid; this
produces a precipitate of velvety-black sesquioxide of ruthenium,
which after edulcoration and drying is reduced in a current of hy
drogen.     In this way perfectly pure metallic ruthenium is obtained.
This mode of separating it from the other platinum metals, with the
exception of osmium, is based on the behaviour of the solution of
the sesquichloride of ruthenium, which is decomposed by heat into
free muriatic acid and sesquioxide. The oxide of osmium is mixed
with the oxide of ruthenium, as the solution contains chloride of
osmium, which is likewise decomposed.             The osmium-iridium is
only partially decomposed in the above treatment with chlorine, and
must therefore be treated with it three or four times.
   Ruthenium thus prepared forms angular pieces, of metallic lustre,
which are porous, and very closely resemble iridium.            Its specific
gravity is very low, viz. 86 at 61°F.; but it is highly probable that
it is but little inferior in this respect to iridium, for some porous
iridium, which was prepared in a similar manner from the blue oxide
of iridium IrO", had a specific gravity of 93. Ruthenium is very
brittle, does not fuse in the flame of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and
is almost insoluble in acids; aqua regia dissolves mere traces of                                it.
After osmium, ruthenium has the greatest affinity for oxygen              all               of
the platinum metals, for            very readily oxidized
                                        it       is             heating          on              to

powder, which dissolves with an orange colour in acids, glows sud
denly when heated, and is not perfectly reduced at the ordinary tem
perature by hydrogen.         It is insoluble in alkalies.
    III. Oxide of Ruthenium, RuO'. Anhydrous-On roasting and
igniting RuS2, a blackish-blue powder, with a greenish play of
 colours, is obtained, which is insoluble in acids, and contains 30-7
 parts oxygen to 100 of metal. It is obtained when RuO", 2SO4 is
 exposed to a strong red heat in small grayish particles of metallic
 lustre, and with a beautiful blue and green iridescence.
     The hydrate, RuO2 + 2aq?, has not yet been analysed, but it will
 undoubtedly possess the above composition; it is obtained as a
 gelatinous yellowish-brown precipitate, when the solution of the
 double chloride KCl2 + RuOl" is mixed with NaO CO2, and evapo
 rated. It contains much alkali, dissolves with a yellow colour in
 acids, and these solutions become of a rose-red on evaporation.
 When heated in a platinum spoon it detonates with a lively incan
 descence, and is projected in all directions.          In the dry state it has
 the colour of impure oxide of rhodium.

possessed    by the sparingly soluble double salts of other platinum
metals, among others by the sodiochloride of rhodium.                   The cry
stallized   sesquichloride   of ruthenium and         potassium   is almost inso
luble in a concentrated solution of chloride of ammonium, and                                   I
have used this salt in washing the salt of ruthenium, to free it from
any admixture of chloride of potassium. This method is far more
certain than the employment of spirit, which only removes with dif
ficulty the last traces of that admixture. It is scarcely necessary to
observe that the chloride of ammonium must be subsequently ex
tracted with spirit, which however, from the great solubility of the
salt, is very readily and quickly effected.
     II. Sesquichloride of Ruthenium and Ammonium, 2NH4 Cl +
 Ruº Cl3, is very easily obtained by mixing the concentrated solution
 of the black sesquioxide in muriatic acid with chloride of ammonium,
 and concentrating by evaporation with the addition of a little nitric
 acid. The salt cannot be distinguished in form and properties from
 the potash salt; it leaves, as required by the formula, 32.7 per cent,
 metal when ignited in a current of hydrogen.                  Both these salts,
 although more soluble than KCl + IrCl3, do not dissolve easily in
 the crystallized state in water; notwithstanding they crystallize with
 difficulty from their solutions, and only when these are highly con
 centrated.

  complete conversion. When heated with muriatic acid and chlorate
 of   potash, some                  formed; but the greater portion

 3 atoms of sulphur to 1 of ruthenium;      but if the gas has been passed
 through for several hours, a sulphuret, RuS*, of yellowish-brown
 colour, is obtained. Sulphuret of ammonium throws down a blackish
 brown sulphuret, Ru? Sº, from the blue protochloride; however,           I
 place little value on these analyses, as the difficulties render the re

    I  have little experience on this series of compounds, as their pre
 paration is very difficult, and my material was consumed ; I onl
 obtained the sulphate of ruthenium, RuO2 + 2SO9, from the sul
 phuret, which is formed on treating Ruº Cl3 with sulphuretted hy
 drogen by oxidizing it with ordinary mitric acid. An orange-coloured
 solution is obtained, yielding on evaporation to dryness a yellowish
 brown amorphous mass, which attracts moisture, deliquesces, and
 has an acid astringent taste. The dry compound reduced to powder
 resembles mosaic gold, dissolves readily in water, and is not preci
 pitated at first by alkalies; but on evaporation the yellowish-brown
 gelatinous hydrated oxide separates, which has the greatest resem
 blance to the impure oxide of rhodium, and explodes with incan
 descence when heated.        Sulphuretted hydrogen does not produce
 the blue reaction in the solution of this salt.—Liebig's Annalen for
 August 1846.

    M. Gerhardt observes that chemists admit of the existence of two
 compounds of nitrogen and phosphorus; one composed of 1 atom of
 phosphorus and 2 atoms of nitrogen (PN”) is produced, according to
 M. H. Rose, when the protochloride is heated with ammonia; accord
ing to MM. Liebig and Wöhler it is also formed by the action of heat
on the produce of the reaction of ammonia on perchloride of phos
phorus.
    The other compound of nitrogen and phosphorus has been described
 by M. Liebig in his Annalen. It is considered by him as a compound
 of the preceding phosphuret of nitrogen, and the elements of water
 (PN*-H H2O); it is therefore a hydrated phosphuret of nitrogen.
    The composition which is attributed to these two compounds by
the German chemists being different from those defended by MM.
 Gerhardt and Laurent, the former has subjected them to fresh ex
amination, and states as the result that no such compound as phos
phuretof nitrogen exists; and that the two bodies improperly so named
are mixtures of three definite compounds, one of which he calls
phosphamide, containing phosphorus, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen;
the second, which he names biphosphamide, contains phosphorus,
nitrogen and oxygen; and the third, named phospham, consists of
phosphorus, nitrogen and hydrogen.
    Phosphamide.—When gaseous ammonia is passed over perchloride
of phosphorus contained in a long tube, the chloride becomes con
siderably heated, fuses, gives out much hydrochloric acid gas, and
produces much hydrochlorate of ammonia. The product obtained

luble portion is impure phosphamide; it is to be purified by boiling
for some hours in dilute solution of potash until it ceases to dis
solve any chlorine; then with weak nitric acid, and lastly- with

   Like the previously described compounds, phospham is a white
powder, insipid and insoluble in common solvents; it also yields,
when fused with potash, common phosphate and ammonia.
   In concluding, M. Gerhardt asserts that no phosphuret of nitrogen
is formed, as stated by M. Liebig, by the action of ammonia on per
chloride of phosphorus, the result of their action containing 1-5 per
cent. of hydrogen; and that no such compound as hydrate of phos

                                                                      contained                                it

to distinguish it from the crude article of commerce, M. Robiquet
gave it the name of aloetine.
   The properties of aloetine are that, when prepared out of the con
tact of the air as much as possible, it is in the form of nearly colour
less scales, which are very soluble in water and alcohol, slightly
dissolved by aether, and perfectly insoluble in fixed and volatile oils;
when calcined in close vessels it leaves merely a bulky and brilliant
charcoal, which disappears entirely by calcination.     Aloetine is not
coloured by the salts either of protoxide or peroxide of iron, and
gives no precipitate with acetate of lead; in other respects it acts
upon reagents similarly to Socotrine aloes.
   If aloetine be dried in contact with the air, the scales obtained,
instead of being nearly colourless, have an intense red colour derived
from a slight absorption of oxygen. Except this difference of colour,
aloetine altered by the air undergoes no change of chemical proper
ties, and analysis scarcely shows any difference between them. The
purification of aloes may be much shortened by drying it by the
water-bath or exposure to the sun, when it is not required to be of
the utmost purity.
   M. Robiquet gives the following as the results of his analysis of
aloetine, and also a formula, which, however, he states as an approxi
mation only    :—

   M. Robiquet states that aloetine  possesses in the highest degree
the purgative property and bitter taste of common aloes : medici
nally employed, 8 parts of aloetine represent 10 parts of Socotrine
and 50 parts of Cape aloes.—Journ. de Pharm. et de Ch., Septembre

the remaining elements represent the composition of cacotheline.
   When cacotheline is subjected to the action of ammonia it is con
verted into various products, among which is an alkaline base pos.
sessing several remarkable properties.    It contains the elements of
the vapour of nitrous aether, and acts, when heated, like substances
which have undergone substitution by hyponitrous acid. The small
quantity which M. Laurent possessed did not permit an analysis.
